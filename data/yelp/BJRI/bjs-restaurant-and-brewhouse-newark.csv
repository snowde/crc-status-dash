Sarah L.,"Union City, CA",294,112,416,4.0,7/15/2017,My husband and I went here on a Friday night for date night. You have to be prepared to roam the parking lot for days just to find a spot.. We ended up parking by the gas station across the street.. I think it's the Overflow parking lot.? After all that once we got in the weight time was ridiculous.. but expected on a Friday night! Luckily there was bar seating open and we were able to sit right away! (Bar seating available first-come first-serve which includes high top tables) we were greeted by the server who was very pleasant. I ordered the classic burger with french fries and my husband ordered the mahi mahi tacos (fried). When our food came it was PERFECT! MY BURGER WAS SO JUICY AND HAD A GREAT CHAR ON THE OUTSIDE! The Buns had a great toast on the inside and had a nice gloss on top. The french fries were perfectly fried and had a great crunch as well.  The mahi-mahi tacos were also made perfectly! It was fried but NOT dry and was nice and flaky. Great flavors BUT the green stuff I think it was a guacamole sauce . It tasted a bit funny almost over ripe?  It was also nice that the manager stopped by to see how everything was.  No complaints here except for the parking lol We would definitely come back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60
Sean C.,"Fremont, CA",1014,1383,2184,3.0,6/20/2016,"Nearly twenty-four hours after the Golden State Warriors loss (Game 7, 2016 vs. Cleveland), there should be an empty hole inside me. Thankfully, the BJ's deep dish filled up the void. With all the sports TV's, I couldn't have unassumingly picked a better place; every shoulder turn there's a new TV to look at. The staff must hate LeBron James because as soon as it cut to his post-game interview, they cut off the sound. LeBron is a true nemesis but I can't deep down not admire the guy; I could have listened to him for a couple minutes. You'd think as a Warriors fan I'd be all for the Golden Pilsners, but not quite. I almost never go without the Jeremiah Red Beer (toasty amber hue). And I never finish without doing a Pazookie (baked cookie with ice cream on top). This particular staff is almost rock solid. I only found one of the four hostesses a little airhead-y, but the waiters and waitresses like to think two steps ahead of the customers (except when it comes to the cheque; I'll wave anybody down after this much waiting post-Pazookie. Come on!) Good kid's menu. Good coloring book and crayons. Good iced water. Good beer (for me). Solid 3-stars, but there's upside here if you need sports TV viewing. SUBSEQUENT TRIP HERE: We ordered a pizza, pasta dish and pazookie dessert and they all came at the same time, that means, dripping ice cream on cookie when we're just trying to start on pizza. Idiotic. #likereally",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60
Kia F.,"San Jose, CA",3,125,12,1.0,6/21/2017,"We were here Tuesday night from 10:15pm until around 11:55pm, June 20, 2017. Our server was Shea, and she was inattentive and served us in a hurry. She would come and leave with a quickness that was unbecoming of basic food service hospitality. She left me wondering if she even wanted to be there to ""take care of us"". No refills, she gave us the bare minimum version of checking-in and no ""sorry the food is taking a while"". She managed to drop off the bill with a sub-standard script and snatched it away without a word as soon as it was ready. She left the card and customer copy in the same swift, non-verbal way.  To top it off, the fries were barely warm, we waited 40 minutes for the food and the steak was chewy. This was not a good night at BJs, Fremont. It wasn't even busy! Thanks, but we will remember to go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60

Our host was good she was very friendly that is why I added 1 star but the food was not good we ordered 2 app sets of calamari it was very salty and overly battered and seems like was fried in an old oil our main dishes was not as expected also we ordered jalapeño burger and it was totally burnt but last we ordered birthday pazooki ice cream the cookie was very doughy it was under cooked so basically bj's ruined my son's birthday we walked out  unhappy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60
Steve C.,"Hayward, CA",14,19,23,3.0,1/16/2017,"I usually only review a place if it's a 1 or 5 star place. Either you had to be really mad enough to remember to write a review, or the experience went so well you feel compelled to shout your love to the world via Yelp reviews.  Today's experience with BJ's was mainly an indulgence trip; I came literally for the chocolate chip pizookie.  Like a genius, I decided to order the full size version with a glass of milk for just one: me. This experience definitely is best left in your mind. However I do think I won't be thinking about eating a whole pizookie ever again.  Let's break this review down into sections: customers, environment, cleanliness, location, parking, food quality, service. Customers are standard of a family friendly restaurant. Some families are here, some couples, some old friends who deserve their own sitcom where they can sit-calm... I'm punny. That's how we Filipinos say ""funny"".  The environment is chill. Got some paintings on the wall and tvs with sports on them. Music is okay. Good enough to blend into any conversation without you really giving a crap about the music.  Points docked for cleanliness. I arrived around 3pm so it's not too crowded, yet my table still had obvious residue. I do not want to lean my arms on the table. the seat was fine tho.  This location is right off the freeway and near Newpark Mall so it's like Landmark status. Easy to find and the parking (at least for 3pm). FOOD QUALITY!!! Caps lock helps wake up the readers. The pizookie was too big for me to want to finish alone. This definitely requires 2 or more in my opinion. The flavor is good though. The outsides of the cookie are crispy with a gooey chocolatey center. So the cookie isn't fully cooked. It is crunchy outside and gooey inside. If this is what you like more power to you. The vanilla ice cream quality is okay too. You can see the vanilla beans in the ice cream. The milk is standard milk.  SERVICE.... A bit slow. I can understand though because I am not the only person this waitress has to worry about. She helping lots of other people so I forgive the wait times. Midway through she had a dude named Mike come and replace her so she can take her lunch break. This guy is okay he is chill. I just wish he was around to ask for the check earlier than I found him. But it's okay I won't make a big deal out of it (says a Yelp reviewer; I cannot be trusted).  I have given my thoughts on my rubric, but I have not had the chance to check out the bathroom. I usually enjoy describing a restaurant's restroom because a clean restroom shows a restaurant has pride and good work ethics. Maybe I'm just OCD idk.  WHY THREE STARS THO? YOU ENJOYED THE COOKIE!!!  The main reasons were service, wait time, cleanliness and price. For a glass of milk and the pizookie full size its 10.32 and a 15% tip is 1.42 making the total $11.74 which is a bit much for only being able to finish half of the pizookie. Maybe even less than half. I feel a bit jipped off at least for what I paid. Then again the server did say they had a mini pizookie for like $3.XX I should have just gone for that one.  The service was good enough, but no efforts to make me feel ""special"" or give me a memorable experience were attempted. Not sure how happy the workers are here. I don't blame them though, I hate customer service myself. Yelp is cool tho cuz I get to be that anal customer reviewing stuff lmao. I mentioned the table not being clean earlier, and the wait time was slightly longer than ideal.  If I wanted to be nice I would rate this a 4 star, but trying to look at this review as corporately as possible they might rate itna 3 star. Personally I guess I would say it's a 4 star, but I'm trying to give an unbiased opinion.  That was my review you made it this far and you deserve something great like 10% off your next BJs visit or something. Unfortunately I cannot grant that request so I hope my thanks is good enough. Thank you for reading this review, see ya next time! Steve Carney Amatuer Yelp Critic",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60
Saachi G.,"Fremont, CA",486,213,3129,4.0,1/19/2017,"Adding a star for the great service we received last night. I was able to put our group on the preferred wait list so when we arrived we were immediately seated. We asked for a booth and were given one. Our server Jonathan was very helpful all night, a step up from service we have had in the past. He was very quick to bring our beers/drinks throughout our meal, which I really appreciated. Also, a big thank you to the manager for sorting out a bit of a coupon mishap we had. You and Jonathan definitely improved our experience as loyal customers at BJ's.

Christian C.,"Union City, CA",309,73,12,1.0,5/23/2017,"My sister and her husband were there this past weekend, ordered a pizza and received more toppings than they liked. When the pizza came out it appeared to have a huge chunk of cheese but at first it appeared to be a condom on top of the pizza, but it turned out to be a finger condom to cover up cuts and bandaids. None the less pretty gross, it's basically like finding a bandaid. I would be cautioned until the kitchen issues are resolved, my head chef would never let anything but food be served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60
Sheila C.,"Union City, CA",140,298,495,2.0,12/7/2016,"Who goes to BJ's and doesn't get a pizookie?! I always try and save some space for dessert! There's a couple different kinds of pizzokie's you can get. There's also a trio but they're mini sized so they're good for first timers!  I've never really been a fan of BJ's. It's always too crowded even during the weekdays. Parking is something they need to really improve on. There's a ton of parking on the other side of BJ's but it's an inconvenience and during the weekends, that area can also get pretty packed.  The food isn't all that great. I used to love coming here only for their deep dish stuffed raviolis but they don't have it anymore :( they were so delicious!   What's really shocking about BJ's is that they microwave all their stuff including chicken and all. I honestly thought they were freshly made. Don't think I'd come back again unless it was some kind of event.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60
Jim J.,"Naperville, IL",26,58,,2.0,11/2/2017,"The ambiance of this restaurant is nice, but the service is mediocre and the food falls way short. Came here for lunch, and started with the Avocado Eggrolls. They were kind of non-descript, with the texture consistency of baby food and flavor to match. Also had the Santa Fe Chicken Salad, which was rather limp, and had a weird mix of flavors that didn't really resemble chicken or barbecue. Both dishes were so over salted that the flavor essentially burned in my mouth. How do you screw up a salad?  Not impressed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60

Jessica R.,"Union City, CA",165,135,121,3.0,5/10/2017,"Been here many times and the food is the usual American menu. Food is alright. Sometimes it comes out cold. Pastas, burgers, pizzas, beer, liquor, etc. the only thing I think people actually go here for is the pazookies. Those are   if you have a sweet tooth. Calamari is delicious, nicely crispy! Service is usually pretty good when I come here so can't complain about that. Come here if you want dessert or some drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60
Ying Bo C.,"Newark, CA",12,4,,1.0,10/1/2017,"We noticed waiters wearing some type of tablet for ordering.  My order was switched from Ziti to Chicken Alfredo.  Wife's side order was wrong.  They rushed my order out and under cooked the pasta.  My wife's prime rib was not seasoned at all.  She ate two bites and threw it away!  That's $24 in the trash!  So if you want to flush money down the drain, go to BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60
Laverne A.,"Daly City, CA",0,36,38,1.0,2/25/2017,"Before you read, could BJ's please give some recognition to our waitresses April. She was awesome.  Well, as most of the Yelpers on here talking about the host check in. That would also explain the 1 star. Come on BJ's invest some money into training these folks. They are front and center of your business. Such a shame.  Here's the email I sent corporate:  I put my party on the priority wait list. Upon check in was told that it was only 15 minutes. Checked in the 3 times with desk and lady kept saying we were next after we saw all these other people getting checked in. Finally had it and stood in front of lady until we were called to be seated. Waitresses, very nice lady named April took our order. Appetizers came out. Ordered stuffed mushrooms and a quarter was larger than the size of the mushroom. I have photos. Also ordered top sirloin with asparagus and mashed potatoes, asparagus ends not trimmed and still had dirt ends. I also have photos. Mashed potatoes, cold in the center. Told our waitresses but situation was beyond repair and completely frustrating. I will not be returning to any BJ's nor will I have my company have any functions there until this is addressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60
Marshal R.,"Fremont, CA",107,242,27,3.0,11/19/2016,"I want to love BJ's, I really do but within the last 2 years there's been so many issues. It almost doesn't even seem like it's this location. I've gone to other locations and experience the same kind of service and food issues. 4 out of my last 5 visits we've had trouble even getting a table. They'd give us a buzzer and then 45 mins later we have to inquire about where we were in line just to come and find out that they supposedly called for us but the buzzer didn't go off (we were at the bar while waiting). And many more cases like this. The wait staff is VERY hit or miss (at every location I've been to). The food comes out in a weird order at times, like getting your appetizer with your entree (what?). Kind of defeats the purpose of an appetizer. Reason for keeping it a 3*** is because the beer is always good.

d s.,"Orange County, CA",60,83,7,3.0,7/22/2017,"We had the chicken lettuce wrap, Deep Dish California and Mediterranean pizza, Monkey Bread dessert. Chicken lettuce wraps were really bad. They add alot of mushrooms, celery, chestnuts all topped with chips. Shredded carrots on the side with 2 sauces, horse radish and the other I couldnt tell. The whole dish tasted like a bad attempt to make Chinese chicken at home with extra salt. Gross. -1 And they did not give seperate plates for the appetizer, which is defintely short sightedness with the given appetizer. -1 Pizza was better - Mediterranean is always good. California supreme was just okay. Next time we will stick to BJs favorite and Mediterranean. +1 Dessert - Monkey Bread with ice cream. Its like a moist cinnabon with ice cream. +1 The food was prompt, despite it being full at 2pm on a Saturday. +1",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60
Tara K.,"Dallas, TX",0,32,4,4.0,8/17/2017,"BJ's hasn't let me down when it comes to great tasting food. I've tried a variety of their items: burgers, salads, pizookie, fish n chips, deep dish pizza, seafood, steak; they were all excellent! I love/hate that they have so many options, especially if you can't make up your mind about what you want! They truly have enough variety to satisfy any diet, so anyone complaining about that is just being picky. The atmosphere is great: pretty chill, clean, decent noise volume, space between your table and the next one over, and TVs on different stations. It's definitely my go-to place when it comes to grabbing quality lunch or dinner. If you eat here regularly, the rewards program is a bonus. It's always great getting credit towards your bill or a free item (we redeemed a triple chocolate mini pizookie with chocolate ice cream on it and OH. MY. GOD. Delicious and I hate chocolate.) -- if you have enough points. The staff is all right. The host/hostess at the front can sometimes be unenthused, which is weird since it's the first face you typically see when entering the restaurant. The waitstaff is somewhat attentive. I think they could work on watching drinks more. Often, it's a good 10 minutes before they notice an empty cup on the table and then another 5-ish for them to bring a refill. All in all, I haven't experienced anyone who is rude or negative in any way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60

I settled on the Salmon and Quinoa bowl, and my colleague had the grilled chicken.  Both of our entrees were awesome in size, quality, and flavor.  We left completely satisfied!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=60

Ordered calamari and avocado egg rolls for appetizer and both are very good. My kids all ordered black and bleu burger as their faves here.  Sometimes they get the pizza.   I got southern fried chicken which is not in the menu but very good and my fave here.  Sometimes I get the spaghetti and the loaded nachos is also good here.

She was absolutely attentive and always bringing us a refill on the drinks and she did a good job checking up on my friend and I if we needed anything else! She was super friendly and it looked like she was happy to work there. GREAT SERVICE!  The food was absolutely AMAZING! I always get a deep dish pepperoni extreme. SO YUMMY. My friend and I got a medium, which has 8 pieces - each of us split it so we ate 4 each! We also decided to try the mozzarella sticks which were pretty tasty as well! MAKE SURE YOU SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! BY DESSERT I MEAN THE PIZOOKIE, DUH!  If you don't know what a Pizookie is, it's basically a huge oven baked warm delicious cookie with TWO HUGE scoops of ice cream to top it off! GOOD FOR SHARING! They have different flavors for each Pizookie and a thing called a ""Pizookie trio"" where you can try 3 mini pizookie flavors for about $10 dollars! I got the chocolate chunk flavor, UGH. SO MUCH GOOEY CHOCOLATEY GOODNESS!  I will definitely be back again soon! Especially for the PIZOOKIES!

The environment is always upbeat, they always have a good selection of drinks on draft (well, it is a brewery of course), lots of TV screens with a good selection of channels, friendly wait staff, and pretty decent food. Some of my favorites: Seared Ahi Salad--at times can be a little too acidic, but the avocado and the Ahi help to cut the acidity, and it is actually a pretty healthy salad (many salads at these bar places are worse for you than the burgers). All you can eat soup and salad lunch special--you can pick and choose from any combination od their soups and salads.  They usually have some light soups, some creamy soups, and some hearty soups--perfect to go w their house, cesar, or wedge salads. Grilled Fish Tacos--only comes w two, but the serving size is actually quite filling along w the chips.  I recommend the grilled fresher fish over the fried frozen fish. Avocado Egg Rolls--love these for an appetizer.  If I am w a slightly larger group, I like the sampler that gives a bit of everything for everyone to try without spoiling the meal.

Came here twice in the span of 2 weeks and had fun both times but the first time had a 30 min wait and the second time an hour wait...yikes.  The food is a bit pricy but heard no complaints except for my friend who said her pasta Alfredo was dry but I love their beer here and their other entrees seem like good quality. I ordered the kale salad and was very satisfied with the taste, not at all bitter, and the appetizers were yummy.

Perhaps because we've been celebrating birthdays, graduations, and literally everything else here since we were in high school :')  The bar is huge and they have about 1,000 TVs.

We ordered  some appetizers that were at most-ok but service was nice and efficient. Place was packed on a Friday night yet food came quick-hence 3 stars. Problem the food was lacking luster and flavor all around. I bet if the food actually tasted better it would be 5 star. Bummer. Yet we ate because we were hungry but left lots of food. (my dogs ate it the next day-they loved it). The table next to us was the same! Plates full of food unfinished-what a shame! Would go back for beer and appetizers nothing else. I must say that the manager was very professional and attentive and wanted to make things right. Kudos! She comped 1 of our pizzs. It was suppose to be Chicago deep dish and OMG not even close- was like a Expensive little Cesars pizza with less sauce (insert annoyed emoji here). So yeah the food was repugnant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=100
M H.,"San Jose, CA",0,26,,2.0,8/31/2017,"I've been here a few times. Place is always packed, with long waits, and scatterbrained and exasperated servers. Really long wait times that favor those who call-in over those who have showed up in person--and staff will tell you that to your face after you've been waiting for twice as long as you've been told you would.  Waiter tossed food on the table, our ""made to order"" pizookie came out in five minutes, far before our entrees. We were starving after our hour wait, and had two hungry children with us, so we ate our dessert before our dinner.  Food is fine. It's not great, and it's not quick--unless it's the pizookie.

It's a shame that my experience was great here... but what I saw can never be unseen!!!!! I saw the bartender make some sort of strawberry drink. After she shook the drink, she looked at the drink with big eyes and pulled out a set of keys...crazy right?! Then instead of throwing it out and making a new one... she added more ice then sent it off with a waiter!! Because of this I stared her down while she filled up our pitcher!

On numerous occasions when attempting to call in the take out order, the phone was not getting answered, and when it was I was put on hold and they hang up. I had to call the BJ corporate offices just to get a return phone call from the branch manager to take my order for 14 people. This is the last time. They are a bunch of idiots.

I just gave up. One of the bartenders  thought they were being smart by replacing my weak ass long island for an even WEAKER one thinking I wouldn't notice the difference. He must have been on something good. LI drinkers know what to expect, as a bartender you should have known better! Two things about me you should know, don't mess with my FOOD and don't you dare serve me a BS Long Island. 7 liquors in that bitch and I can't taste ONE? Fk out of here. Really? They gave me a carbonated lemon-aid! You know it's probably one of the most  (if not, the most) expensive drink on any menu so please miss me with that.   It definitely wasn't our waiters fault however he wasn't much better. He could have apologized for, 1) me having to send back the first drink 2) me having to send back the second drink 3) when our salads came, asking us a BS question like ""Oh, do you not have utensils?"" ( Do you see any? Your salads aren't that great that we're gonna sit there and stare  at it!) 4) Give or take, just being a monotoned as waiter. No smile, no real greeting, not really attentive. Maybe he was having a bad day, I get it. However, when your customer is clearly unhappy, the least you could do is apologize. Not because it's your fault, but because your team is messing up and therefore messing up your tip! Your money! Ain't nobody got time for that. But it's obvious to us that you could have cared less.. and that's fine honey. So, we up and left that bitch. ( Bj's, not him LOL) We ordered apps which were probably already in the making that we never got. That went to waste. The two drinks that I had to send back went to waste, tho I would have been happy with them just making it proper by adding more liq instead of making two weak ones. The salad that we got but never ate went to waste.  So good job you've wasted all of those items Bravo!  Went to Elephant bar, had a REAL drink and a REAL waiter and ended up having a bomb ass date night regardless. I believe everything happens for a reason, even shit like this, and I was meant to have a wonderful waiter and proper drinks that night. So Thank you. P.s Extra star for the delicious water that was brought out pretty quickly. At least that didn't go to waste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=100

Calamari came and coffee - so far so good. Then came our main dish but they got my friend's food wrong. The waiter apologized and said he will take off the calamari from our bill as a courtesy. We waited for another 15 mins for the correct order to come, meanwhile I did not touch my food because it's nice to eat together. When the food came I asked for more coffee. The coffee came and it was cold and probably not freshly brewed. So I complained. Then came our bill and the waiter went back on his word and charged me for the calamari.

After an additional 20 minutes, told it would be another indefinite period of time because of the call aheads. Frustrated, we talked to a manager. We wouldn't have stayed if it would have been over an hour. The manager, Roddy, was very polite and seated us almost immediately. After waiting at the table for about 5 minutes with no server greeting us, he quickly came by and apologized, took our order and brought us drinks. After a terrible beginning to the meal, Roddy single handedly saved the night.

For me, he has messed up a simple bloody Mary 3 times, once it didn't even come with olives. I know that may sound harsh but this place used to have the best bloody Mary's around. So to go from the best to the worst is quite a landslide. Today I made sure to ask for all the fixings with my drink, he said they only had olives and limes. What happened to the tasty spicy glass rim and the Peruvian cherry pepper... For goodness sake, at least a stalk of freaking celery would be nice!

We were very unsatisfied with the level of service and the quality of the food. First thing, we made a reservation for a table of 13 for 6:30 the day before. When we arrived, we were told they don't have the reservation on the list. It wasn't a big deal since the wait was only approximately 10 minutes. Second, the waitress did not know the menu very well, she had to match the item on the menu with the price on the tablet to get the order in.  Third, the food was very salty, it tasted like they pour the whole bottle of salt on there. Lastly, the promotional items were not discounted on the bill, we had to ask the manager to get the bill corrected. This took like 30 minutes since our waitress was nowhere to be found.

First off it wasn't busy so I don't under stand why we waited 45 mins for 3 bacon cheeseburgers and not only that but the wings (appetizer) came out at the same time as the food . We asked for grilled onions on 2 of the burgers which they forgot to put on for what ever reason let our waitress know and she said she would talk to the cook about it. Waited 10 more minutes and finally got those grilled onions although it wasn't the same since we had to spread them on ourselves finally took a bite of my burger and then I noticed there was no mayo on my bread. I then got my waitresses attention and let her know there was no mayo and if they can just remake the burger. She took it back and remade it and apologized but when the burger came out this time there was no BACON on my BACON cheeseburger cmon guys get it together. I let her know there was no bacon on it now and she said she would bring some bacon out I let her know I was fine and I will just pass on the meal the manager came over and let me know he didn't charge for the burger.

Went ahead and Ordered artichoke and spinach dip for an appetizer waited a while for that. Our soup and salad came out but we didn't have utensils. Had to ask for those. Main course we ordered 2 prime rib specials, comes with either a soup or salad and then 2 sides and pizookie. I asked for prime rib medium and my husband asked for his medium rare, both of ours came out well done and tough. They took his back and made him a new one. Waited at least 10 min for the new prime rib, it was better. Asked for ranch and it took 3 reminders. Also ordered a sirloin and a small pizza. Now still waiting for our server to come back to order our pizookie. We've been waiting for 20 min. We all finished our food at the table still no one has come back to check on us. Still waiting and managed to finish writing a yelp review. This will be our last visit here, not spending anymore money at this joint. Definitely need to improve their customer service and be more attentive. 1 star for their beer 1 star for their pizookie.

Sherrie J.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,29,1,1.0,12/23/2016,"Came here with some friends on a Thursday night and waited 2 hours for a table (understandable since it was so busy). The reason for the 1 star are multiple things: 1) the hostess that brought us to our table just threw the menus at us  2) did not bring drinks for the whole table and when we requested drinks, she came back 15 minutes later with the rest of them  4) original waitress left and didn't say she was leaving; another waitress took our orders (this isn't a big deal, but almost, if not all the times that this is happened to me, I've had the server tell me he/she was leaving and that someone else would be helping us; maybe this isn't customary?) 5) food orders were wrong  6) dessert orders took way too long (30+ minutes for a pizookie...) We kind of felt she forgot, and when I asked about the status of our order, the 2nd waitress said they were taking care of it (it was brought out about 15 minutes later so it seems like she forgot it and just placed the order for it when I reminded her) Overall, the food was meh for BJs, but I'm hoping that's just a one time thing and not a lack of flavor in their food overall. The service wasn't that great and could use some improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=120
Rebekah N.,"Hayward, CA",74,41,35,5.0,4/10/2016,"Okay honestly I didn't expect much from this restaurant based on the reviews but I actually really enjoyed our food and service. Food: I ordered a mini deep dish pizza with pepperoni and pesto and it was SOO GOOD. Fluffy crust and bread and lots of cheeses I really enjoyed it despite the fact that I got a mini which is literally he size of my hand. However, with an appetizer it was enough for me. My boyfriend ordered meatball marinara and he enjoyed it as well. It was a lot of food for two the appetizer and drinks really filled us up Drinks: I ordered a root beer but the kind that it "" all natural"" and made in house. It does not come with ice so I got that too and I enjoyed it. Very concentrated so I recommend ice and my boyfriend ordered the strawberry splash. I tried it and it was decent I guess I'm not a alcoholic slushy drink type of person but if you like sweet and slushy get it!  Service: our servers name was Joselyn and she was so nice. It took her long to come to us but she explained that it was due to confusions with tables. I appreciated the clearing up of things. Either than that she was very attentive and bright everything right when I asked for it. She is pretty, friendly, and I will totally come back due to her good service Overall: I enjoy everything from my appetizer to my drinks and my meal which is why I think this deserves such a lengthy Yelp review. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=120
Kevin A.,"Union City, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/8/2017,"In short: Stay away from this establishment. Corporate needs to step in.  I arrived on a Sunday evening with a party of four. The restaurant itself was somewhat crowded so I was expecting to have to wait for a table - which I did, no big deal. My party and I are seated in an uncomfortably dark area isolated from most of the other restaurant patrons. As I fear and expect we are left waiting for nearly ten minutes before a waiter attends to us, again no big deal.  At first he seems like a nice guy, a bit awkward but nice, I'll refrain from using his name as I don't want to publicly humiliate him for what follows. He proceeds to take our drink and food order and again we wait another solid ten minutes before he returns with our drinks. As he begins to hand out our beverages he spills a noticeable amount on the table, my arm, and my clothing. I catch him look down but he makes absolutely no effort to rectify the situation - no apology as he quickly dashes from our table to check his phone at a register station.  Another ten or so minutes pass before our appetizers are brought to the table. Stuffed mushrooms with spinach and cheese. One would think - 'how hard is it to possibly mess up a stuffed mushroom'. Well you guessed it, BJs did. They were not only cold and flavorless but about the size of a quarter. Awesome.  At this point I call for a manager, something I've never done at any other establishment, ever. A couple minutes pass before a middle aged women approaches the table and asks what the problem is. I begin to explain the situation to her and she looks noticeably uncomfortable as if she has no idea how to handle the situation. She offers to refund us and bring our meals out regardless but at this point I've lost my appetite, I tell her I simply want to pay for what I've consumed and leave. She agrees and apologizes and leaves to grab our check for us. Again we wait for what seems like another ten minutes before a waiter comes to our table with a comp'd check and apologizes to us, ""sorry our manager is dealing with another problem right now, she'll be out in a few more minutes."". Unreal. We gathered our things and walked out the door.  Never before have I experienced such horrible service from the top down. From the host staff, to the servers, even the management. Every aspect was abysmal. Never again will I return to this particular establishment. There is however one shining star here - April.

Prabhleen B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,15,9,1.0,7/31/2017,"This was absolutely the WORSE experience I've ever had at a BJs restaurant. We had been waiting for 40 mins to get a table. When we were finally seated; we asked if there was any way we could get a booth table and we don't mind waiting. The host showed us so much attitude and said most of these are booked for bigger parties mind you we were a party of 6. When the server came to us, we asked him as well, because we saw a booth opening up. She said that the party AFTER us were given that; and we told her we should've been giving that especially after requesting it. We just sat down at our table and began looking at our menu. We ordered appetizers, which came out but we had NO utensils or plates, also have yet to receive our drinks. After this happened to us we asked to speak to the manager. The manager came and she was unapologetic, as well as making excuses for the host. She did absolutely nothing to solve the problem and just brushed it off.   While we are talking to the manager, the host comes up and starts listening in to our conversation. Finally it took so long for the server to actually place our order. I am a regular at BJs so seeing this kind of service was very upsetting  to me. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here.

We ordered a buffalo chicken grilled sandwich and a shrimp asparagus penne and they were both very flavorful and tasty. We couldn't finish the pasta, it was huge!

Mika B.,"Newark, CA",133,181,1078,4.0,10/16/2017,This is probably the third time I've ever been to this restaurant. I came here to have lunch with my old coworker who retired so we kept it simple she had breakfast and I myself had a Caesar salad and a ham and cheese melt. Ryan our servicer was really nice I asked for no sauce for this no sauce for that and he accommodated me. The order was perfect but I have to say that the food was pretty much like black bear or IHOP maybe a little bit better than IHOP.  The restaurant was very clean we were seated really fast and since it was Sunday it was actually pretty busy. I have to say that the one thing I find a bit crazy; the menu is literally an Encyclopedia I think they really need to cut down the size of their menu it is way too big so it takes a while to figure out what you want to eat. So on to the food itself the Caesar salad is a Caesar salad but was actually really good and the ham and cheese grilled was not bad however I found it a little bit oily and the French fries were really good. I really appreciate the fact that Ryan came back and fourth to the table asking if we needed anything and always kept our drinks filled so I have to say customer service is definitely top-notch over here. They really do pay a lot of attention to their customers and I appreciate that and they don't leave dirty plates all over the table but clean it up as soon as you're finished. Since we sat there and talked for a while he never came over and disturbed us and made us feel that we had to rush out of there and I really appreciated that per say the four stars!

Robert W.,"Patterson, CA",1670,147,857,2.0,1/15/2017,"We arrived around 4 pm on a Saturday during the NFL playoffs. Surprisingly we were seated right away, thought there would be more people to watch the games. We sat at a table in the main dining area. About 5 minutes went by and no service. We realized that during playoff games they have happy hour specials, but in the bar area only. There was plenty of open seating in the bar so we moved. We were greeted right away and had the specials explained to us. During happy hour all draft beers are a dollar off and cocktails are $2 off. All appetizers, including the huge sampler are half off along with the mini deep dish pizzas. To start, we ordered drinks. Our first two beer choices were not available because they were out. My wife's second beer choice was also not available because they were out as well. We ordered the large appetizer sampler which comes with avocado egg rolls, chips and artichoke dip, BBQ boneless wings and cheese sticks. That was enough to feed us right there. Didn't realize how big it would be, we ordered 3 mini pizzas as well. The mini pizza is nowhere near as good as a larger deep dish. They were a little over cooked and minimal toppings.

Mark G.,"Fremont, CA",98,170,126,4.0,7/17/2017,"This is like any other BJ's. The food is all the same from place to place. The food is generally good. The servers are always what makes or breaks your dining experience. Call ahead and watch the bar to see if you can swoop on seats. This past time we were here we had Jose as a server at the bar. He was fantastic and was quite personable. He made sure that we had everything we needed/wanted. At the same time he was just an overall cool guy to talk to. He was efficient, which is the main thing I care about when dining. I drank the stout that was only there for a limited time. It was fantastic. What I also like about what this company is trying to do is that they are trying to have different types of whiskeys. They are branching out from the normal, my fiancee got angel's envy in the past and today a whiskey she has had in the past that I forget the name. I have had experiences where the service stunk. We waited due to the server or the food took forever. The drinks also depend on who is making them, so the bartender at the time. Overall you will have a good experience depending on the server and how efficiently everything else is running. Pending that, this Bj's is good.

Angela C.,"Union City, CA",13,14,5,1.0,5/23/2017,"On Sunday 5/21 around 6pm. my husband and I went to the Newark, Ca location to have dinner.  My husband ordered a small pizza, pepperoni extreme I believe. We weren't given plates or utensils so when the food arrived he was just gonna eat it from the pan. When he took a slice what looked like a glob of cheese fell from the slice. At closer inspection, we realized it was some sort of condom or finger protector. We were absolutely horrified and disgusted!  For one, this is extremely unsanitary! Condom or not, it didn't belong on the pizza and is just plain dirty.  Who knows what type of bodily fluid was on it. Semen, blood, sweat, puss?? Who knows!?! And two, this could have been a huge choking hazard! Good think my little niece wasn't with us.  The manager came out and was absolutely speechless. He said he'd look into it. We never found out what it really was or how it got there. You can't tell me as an employee, you won't notice that your finger protector went missing?? Especially while working with food??? Not that I'm a person that tries to get stuff for free. I have a job and make money to buy my own things but we were only comped for the contaminated pizza. It was such a horrible and traumatizing experience. They remade the pizza which my husband agreed to. Personally I wouldn't have eaten it.  I want to make sure that this incident is really taken seriously! I want to know that it really was investigated. Are the employees properly trained in food handling??? Is it a disgruntled employee??? Should health and safety or food inspectors be contacted or sent to this location??? I was in shock at first and just laughed it off. But after the shock wore off, it really pissed me off.

Angelica A.,"Fremont, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/12/2018,"The food is very good but the service was terrible. Our server Kassandra was extremely rude. From the start she gave us slight attitude and we brushed it off, but it got worse once we began to pay for our bill. We asked for separate bills at the beginning and everything seemed fine. Then when we were paying with cash, she just ASSUMED that a couple of freshmen would all be paying with cards. She kept saying that it was ""common sense"" to pay with card when splitting checks trying to make us feel stupid when she couldn't do BASIC MATH. She was clearly new and did not have much experience. As she would pick up our drinks she would stick her hands in them and it made everyone very uncomfortable. Anyways, as we were paying she was swearing under her breath and somehow misplaced 24 dollars worth of our money when we all clearly paid. She was claiming that we didn't pay so we tried to count it but she just kept mixing it. Rather than using a calculator of getting help from a coworker, she just tried to mix all the money and count it without combining the checks. So  she we finally paid 25 dollars so that we could just pay our bill and go home, and she still claimed we were short.

Iris M.,"San Mateo, CA",116,12,1,2.0,7/14/2016,"I've eaten at a few BJs before and this by far was my least favorite. My boyfriend and I stopped by here to eat dinner, before our movie at the AMC theater across the street. Upon walking in, the hostess took about 5 mins before she acknowledged us when the worker in front of her told her that there were customers that just walked in. Yet, she decided that folding napkins were more important.  My bf ordered, a side salad which had only about 3 croutons in it. Where are the other croutons? Did they run out? Next came our spinach and artichoke dip, which was delicious! However, after serving the dip, we noticed that it wasn't even filled half way to the top! We probably only ate about 6 chips with it. So disappointing for being a $10 appetizer.  Now for our meals, I got the roast beef dip and my bf got I believe fish tacos. He was pretty pleased with his food, but as for me, the dip was too thick for an au jus, and lacked flavor. I did not enjoy it, and didn't eat it. The best part of my meal was the thin cut fries and the honey mustard I asked on the side. Overall, I'd choose other places over BJs if I am ever back in Newark. Our server was great. Very attentive and friendly. It's the food portions that need improvement. Especially, being a big franchise such as this.

I've been coming here for years but somehow, its more disappointing of a visit than the previous ones. Why do I keep coming back? sometimes it's the only one open around and i'm super hungry... I went here last night with my boyfriend and we ordered the spinach dip and chips, calamari, a couple of ice teas and root beers, and a large deep dish. Spinach dip: The chips were stale. The spinach dip was burned on the edges and the portion was only filled up half way through the bowl it was in. My boyfriend even looked at me and asked the waitress why the portion is so small. The waitress said that the bowl was just big and that's amount of the dip was their standard amount... lies. I've had more before. it also looked like the dip has been sitting in that bowl for hours cold and then they popped it in salamander oven to heat it up and it got burned.  We hate to send things back to the kitchen and who knows what happens in there with our food. Calamari: Last time my boyfriend and I went there, there were only 8 to 10 pieces of calamari on the appetizer plate, the size was so small, I could grab all 10 with one hand. The plate it was served on was huge as well so it made it look empty on the plate. last night, they had a smaller plate so it seems more on the plate when there wasn't. ice teas: They put too much syrup on the flavored ones. I like sweet stuff but they are very generous on the amount of syrup they pump in these drinks. Pizza: The pizza came out and it looked cold. i ate a piece and half and my boyfriend ate one slice.

We were worried there would be a long wait and we were hungry but around 11 there was no wait at all. I assumed there would be a lot of people at the bar. We got seated at a nice booth and our server took our order fast. He was nice but it often seemed like he was rushing us and trying to get us out the restaurant. I understand it was late and he was tired but the place wasn't even closing until 1. Also a big problem with him was that he had extremely bad body order. My whole table could smell it and even when he walked by. We literally had to hold our breath when he came to the table. I guess he was hard at work though right? Hahah As for the food, they have an extensive menu all the way from pizzas to burgers to pastas to unique baked potatoes. Their bacon burger was probably one of the best and highest quality burgers I have ever had. It was so good I'm dreaming about it right now. I also always order their root beer because it comes from the tap with no foam. I'm not much of a beer drinker so I don't really opt for their beers but they have a large array of selections. Overall, great franchise restaurant just wish our server was wearing deodorant lol I'm always a fan of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=180

Come here more for the social atmosphere and the many beers on tap vs. coming here to get the greatest pizza ever. It's good to have the proper expectations when going into a restaurant so that there isn't a major let down. We were here this past week for an office party hosted by BJ's.

We tried to order these but they came back and told us they ran out :( it was around 11 pm on a Thursday night.  Santa Fe spring rolls: these are pretty tiny. Comes with eight halves during happy hour, not sure how many there are in a normal portion. These have chicken, black beans, red bell peppers, cilantro, corn , jalapeño and jack cheese. They were okay. I wouldn't get them again. The avocado egg rolls are way better (I've tried them during regular meal time before), and much larger.  Mini deep dish pizza: $6 during happy hour, also happy hour sized. But you can get as many toppings as you want! It's basically personal pizza size. But it's deep dish! It was good and came piping hot. I got pepperoni pineapple mushroom jalapeño. I ended up ordering another one after we finished the first one...

We sat down and weren't helped for about 10 minutes. Once we looked at the menu and figured out what we wanted we waived down our waitress who zoomed by and told us that she would be with us shortly. So another 10 minutes go by and she finally takes our order, pitcher of beer and burgers all around. It took about another 15 minutes for the beer to come and then another 10 minutes after that for the food to arrive despite the place being relatively empty. Plus since we all ordered burgers, it should be pretty easy to make instead of making 4 different dishes.  We requested that the burgers be cooked medium, yet we all got burgers that were for sure well done. No pink in the middle and it was not juicy at all. We could have asked for this to be cooked a little more, but we were worried that it would take forever for us to get our food back so we ended up just eating the brick of meat. This place gets 1 star for amazing pizookies & pizzas. They get another star for their beers! I love the different cookie selections for their pizookies and I love the beers that are brewed here since they are so rich in flavor! Unfortunately, I will probably not go back here unless I want dessert or a beer. I honestly don't think I should wait this long on a slow day.

Usually we go to the BJ's in our area, Santa Rosa, when my parents come to visit. We weren't very happy with our experience here.  The location is good, it's next to the freeway, across from a major mall, and it has ample parking. Gas station is next to it too. Food and menu is pretty consistent since this is a chain. Sometime you'd be surprised though, but this time we didn't have anything to complain about.   It was the service that earned a 2-star review.  Shaen introduced herself and things were good.  But throughout the time of dining there, it just got more weird and strained... She wasn't as attentive as she could've been. Like, she'd check up on us, but my mom had to ask for extra sauce a couple of times, and when Shaen gave extra sauce, it wasn't the right one.  I understand it gets busy during weekends, but it's a tad bit weird if you hand us the check when we're finishing up our meal and haven't even received our dessert yet. (We had already put in our order for dessert too.) I think at that point she just wanted to be done with us. I mean, doesn't that make you feel rushed to finish? So, from the middle of our dining to handing back the credit card, there was this really strained interaction and feeling like 'ugh, I want to be done with you.' Would I come back here again?

Didnt say have a seat, over this way, we'll have your table ready in a moment, etc."" we all just stood there in front of them and looked at each other in confusion while we listened to the staff with their personal conversations. Then after a minute, one of them took us to a table for four. She pulled out the 6in extension and gathered chairs from another table to fit 6. I asked her if a booth was available and she said no. I said, we can wait for a booth if we have to because we wont fit 6 in a table designed for 4. And we are asian, so that was how small the table was. Anyways, the hostess had a solution * Put my 5yo in a high chair so it would save some space. Which i replied no, he wont fit in a high chair idiot. He is too big. Absurd solution.  So I told her, there is no way you can fit 6 ppl on a table for 4. So there are two options for you. So i told her two things. We can wait for a booth or we can eat somewhere else. Her response was, ""Well, it might be awhile for a booth."" I just told you we would wait. Geez! So I told her never mind and that we would eat somewhere else that has common sense and respect. I spoke to the manager and explained all this to him, as he looked at his 4-5 hostesses at the front, standing there doing nothing. He tried to keep us there and he didnt seem happy about what he was hearing from me and apologize.

So, I called the night before to make a reservation for 10 for the next night. A gal said the manager wasn't there and that they would call me back to confirm my large party. I never got a call back so I called mid afternoon the next day and they said they'll have a table for us. They have a check-in offer on Yelp. There's a parking lot but it fills up fast; there's never an open spot.  So, we got seated and our server brought us waters and menus. We started out with the Beef Sliders & Fries and the Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo (like a sampler) which had the artichoke spinach dip, mozzarella sticks n stuff. The appetizers tasted alright; not great. Cold dip and semi-stale chips. Anyway, on to the entrees, I got a Deep Dish Ziti while the bf got a Beer Flight with Cheese Curds. My pasta was good but nothing amazing. I also got to try my sister's Buffalo Burger and it tasted okay too. Think my friend's Crusted Chicken Parmesan dish was the best.

They have several items on the menu but not as extensive as you would think. The beer and wine selection are okay and as well as the quality of the food.

My friends and I paid around $11 for calamari, but only half the long skinny plate it was served on was full. The other half of the plate was filled the two sauces.

Missy H.,"Fremont, CA",70,16,,1.0,11/18/2017,"This is a long one so bare with me: Previously, I would have given BJ's a 4 star. Their food is very consistent. We've dined in, Door Dashed and picked up to go previously with no big issues. We usually end up waiting about 5-10 minutes for take away orders. And honestly if I hadn't dealt with the manager at every turn in this experience, I would have let this go but the manager couldn't care less so I'm hesitant to go back. Last night, I put in an order at about 4:50PM with a scheduled pick up at 5:30PM. It was a Friday night so I expected them to be busy and they were. When I arrived with my one year old in tow, there was a gentleman in front of me and behind me and we all paid for our food and sat down to wait.  45 minutes later (almost an hour and a half after the order was placed), my one year old was getting tired an hungry so I stepped up to the counter and told the manager who had rung me up that I'd like to cancel my order and get a refund because I was leaving.  Like magic, my order was ready but we were just waiting on my salad. I had been watching the counter and hadn't seen them bring food out in a while, which meant our food had been in the warmer a while and no one was checking it. I was out the door within 5 minutes of trying to get a refund but when I got home, they had forgotten our appetizer.  I called right away and spoke with the same manager - you know, the one who rang me up, the one I told I'd been waiting 45 minutes, the one I asked for a refund, THE ONE WHO PACKED UP MY ORDER WHILE I STOOD THERE. I told him I was the one who had waited 45 minutes and that he forgot our appetizer. He told me he remembered me and that it was still in the warmer. His only offer was to make me a new one so I could come pick it up. What?!  I advised him that I had a small child who was getting ready for bed so that wasn't possible, to which he said ""well you paid for it,"" and I replied ""yes, I did.""  Silence. I sat there gave my husband an eye roll and he said ""what's going on?"" Still silence. Finally the manager said ""well, I could adjust your bill,"" to which I said ""thank you"". A few things bother me about this: 1 - if I were dining in, I would have been served faster than I was with a take away order  2 - Why did the manager panic when I asked for a refund and throw my order together? If losing customers is a concern, keep up on the to go orders and don't make people keep waiting if their food is ready. 3 - Why was the manager so hesitant to refund me for something HE personally forgot to put in my order? 4 - He only addressed half of my complaint because in what universe is it OK to give someone a 40 minute pick up time and make them wait 45 minutes beyond that?  If I hadn't asked for a refund, who knows how long I would have been there. The gentleman who paid before me was still there when I left, though his food was probably sitting in that warmer...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark

Theresa L.,"Hayward, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/26/2017,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Went to BJ's Brewhouse in Fremont, CA on 2/25/17 for one of my birthday dinner celebration with 12 of my friends. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I made the reservation for our large party several weeks in advance and confirmed the reservation on 2/23/17. In my opinion this was more than enough time for the restaurant to ensure that they were properly staffed Well they were not. Our reservation was for 6:15pm but we arrived early and were told that we would be seated as soon as our server arrived. We were seated at 5:45pm. We had one person taking our orders and we later found out that this was her 2nd shift. Our server apparently never showed up. As meal after meal came out, many of which were either wrong or missing items we asked for a manager at around 7:45. By this time everyone had been served and me and one other person never received our entrées. The manager, Brandi, came to the table very defensive I might add and told me that our orders had never been placed. As one of my friends was trying to explain what had been going on. Brandi said ""I don't want to argue with you"". Lady no one was arguing We were just stating fact. Brandi walks back over to me and asks if I still want my food. Uuuhh no thank you. Everyone else is done and I've been here for 2 hours already. The sad part is that Brandi was trying to blame everything on our server. Sorry it was not the servers fault that you had them working a large party of 13 people alone and on top of a double shift. Brandi as the manager should have called an all hands on deck including herself.  At one point she says I will be back in a minute. I had to go to the front counter to find her after she hadn't come back for a while. Oh I'm sorry that's probably because the other large parties were screaming and having the same issues as we were. Everyone knows with a party of more than 6, you need an additional server for the party. Brandi finally comes to the counter and says ""I'm sorry your birthday dinner didn't work out. I wish we all could've had a better evening"". Seriously I done at that point. She comes to the table and gives me and my friend who both never received our meals a $25 gift card. I will never use mine because I will never go to BJ'S again and will encourage others not to waste their time. After spending too much time trying to figure out our bill and getting that correct, we fnally left the restaurant at 9pm.

I'm usually pretty basic and either get a pizza or the spaghetti because BJ's got rid of my favorite dish, the Cajun Pasta w/ grilled chicken (UGH).  It's pretty average for a BJ's. Almost every BJ's I've been to has been a very 3/5 stars for service and I've never really had a spectacular experience with BJ's in terms of service. One of our servers did inform us that pizookies were free with a purchase of at least $10 every Tuesday until July (also half off wine! like.. bottles included!) so that was a plus.  The thing that kinda made me EH about this place was that I left my credit card with the bill when I left the restaurant (I have a problem doing this...). I called back to the restaurant because I know for sure I left it in the bill as it was nowhere in my car or wallet and I realized it was missing on the car ride home. I called back to the restaurant and they didn't have it... After checking my credit card online, a $50 purchase was made somewhere in Newark that was not by me. So...

Waiter isn't very social, doesn't even know where the restroom is. Food was decent but bad service. The other part is he would take care of the other tables.

We came here on a Friday night for my friends birthday and was told the wait would be about 1-1.5 hours and only ended up waiting about 40 mins. After sitting down we brought in a cake and asked if they could help us surprise my best friend. As a team, they pulled it off and it was pretty awesome. Since it was a tiered cake, we gave the bottom half to the employees.  The food was ok, there was some complications with he food not arriving on time and not tasting up to par, but Ed, took care of all that for us! He made sure that everything was ok and if we weren't happy, he didn't charge us for it. Some people need to understand that it's not the waiter, they have no control on the kitchen and how long things take.

I called when I was only ten minutes away from the restaurant to put in my order and when I arrived my order was ready. The pizza was the perfect amount for a single serving and the root beer was okay. My only disappoint about the root beer was I've tried it before when I ate at the restaurant and it was served in a icy cold chilled cup, when I ordered it to go it came in a plastic cup and not as cold. So, probably will pass on ordering their hand crafted sodas to go. But overall the pizza was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=160

We've both been to this specific location more than once and have never had a bad experience.  But today was terrible. We waited 5 minutes to be seated when it was not busy.  Once seated we waited for 20 minutes with no service. We had already figured out what we wanted within 10 minutes. We were not offered any drinks and more than 4 different waiters and waitresses walked by clearly trying not to acknowledge us.  We then decided to leave and returned our menus to the hostess. All we were given at that point was terrible service and a 'Sorry' which sounded like a question, ""I'm sorry?"" Did not feel like talking to the manager. We were too hungry at that point so we wanted to leave as soon as possible.   Any other times/experiences this place would have gotten an easy 4 star. But after close to a year of not coming to a BJ's and now experiencing this, I am so upset and disappointed, and most likely never going to come to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=160

They make 4 sodas which are great, with refills, so you ask for shots of each of them & get charged for only 1 drink - black cherry, cream, orange cream & root beer (this is a non alcoholic drink in case you do't know). The virgin margherita was too thick for a drink. During happy hour, many items are discounted, including their personal pizzas, which I don't like much as they don't have a lot of sauce. They have several vegetarian pizzas & flatbreads, which are ok. The atmosphere is young, cool, & sporty.

Lou-Lou M.,"Hayward, CA",56,2,2,2.0,1/14/2015,"Service: Came in here earlier for dinner. My friend and I got here around 6:30 pm. We only waited two minutes to get seated. But, it took 10 minutes to find a waiter to place our orders. Our food came 10 minutes later, but the waitress assigned to our section didn't appear until much later. She seemed nice, but for a restaurant staff servicing the dining room, she didn't smell clean. There was one time when my friend and I took a whiff of her body odor as she walked past us and it made us gag while chewing on our food. That's pretty gross. Food: We got our food rather quickly. We only ordered two dishes tonight: 1) Shrimp Scampi Pasta was EXCELLENT! This dish comes with a generous amount of flavored shrimp over angel hair pasta tossed in a light, perfect blend of olive oil, butter, garlic, lemon juice and diced Roma tomatoes. They dish was topped with grated Parmesan cheese, and a dash of bread crumbs and chopped parsley. A full order is about $19, but the serving is enough to be split in two. We truly enjoyed this dish and will definitely get this at the next visit.  2) A large, hand-tossed pizza-half ""BJ'S Favorite"" AKA The Works (Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes) and half ""Sweet Pig"" (best known as Hawaiian). Both flavors look good on paper, but both failed in taste and texture. Both sides of the pie were dry. Our pizza was served on a cold ceramic pizza plate-not on a hot, stainless pizza pan straight from the oven. The pizza pie/crust didn't taste fresh either-it got cold and chewy fairly fast. Very disappointing. Summary: The restaurant is simple and airy. The crowd is good and decent. Noise level is fair. Tonight's dining experience was below average in my opinion. Sign up for BJ's Premium Rewards online and get free stuff like BJ's Famous Pizookie. They give a point per dollar spent.  Rating: For this visit, I'd give it a 2/5 rating. They need more attentive wait staff or I'd think twice bringing a family here because you'll wait a long time to get served. The food came quick, but we weren't asked even once if we enjoyed our meal.  I'll highly recommend Shrimp Scampi Pasta. I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizza, but I'll give it BJ's pizza another shot next time I come back here and hopefully, I'll have a better review then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=240

I don't think it's the servers fault though. I think it's management's fault. I'm not sure how many tables one server is allowed to have, but it seems to be way too many in order to make sure all the guests needs are attended to in a timely manner.

You don't throw your new hires under the bus cause that's a reflection on management and how they prepare their employees.

We got quirky and ordered the ""BJ's Bake Beignet"" deconstructed as we have an aversion to soggy bread.  It wasn't the Nawlin style fried puffy beignet covered with powdered sugar.  It was more like a light bun topped with cinnamon and sugar.

I go inside to pick up my order so I can continue on to work since I was on my lunch. I get to the side desk for quick pick up and I see my food just sitting there on top of the back table and the server who is assisting anyone with curbside orders just looks at me, looks away real fast as if trying to purposely avoid eye contact and then continues on sending out orders to other patrons. No ""hi welcome to BJ's"", no ""one moment miss I'll be right with you"". No, I got none of that. Just her awkwardly avoiding eye contact with me for the next 10 minutes while I'm burning holes into her with my stare. I want her to see I'm getting impatient. She FINALLY addresses me in a half-hearted ""one moment"" then jets off to go to another order. Umm, when it come so customer service you at least address a patron who is wasting their time and spending money in their establishment. And you most CERTAINLY assist the person right there in front of you and not someone who has not even gotten to the restaurant yet for their order.  She finally checks me out for my order after waiting a grand total of 16 minutes when it was supposed to be a quick pick up. Hence the reasoning behind why they have this service in the first place.  If you hate your job then change it. Don't take it out on the patrons going to your establishment with no smile no welcome just your bitter attitude. Yuck, where's a different BJ's at?

For $15 I paid for 6 tiny pieces of ziti which I finished in 3 minutes. Deep dish my... Host was average. Server did not check up on us at all. The food took FOREVER. My friend's parmesan chicken was good and filling. Ordered the trio of pizookies. Got burnt cookies in larger pans, which didn't make sense.

People come here for the good food, beers on tap and the casual atmosphere. You can never go wrong with BJ's, which is why I am generously giving this branch two stars. I have been numerous times to other BJ's restaurants in east bay, and the Newark location is the branch that has given me the worst dining experience. On a weekday night (7PM) I came here with my sister who had a birthday reservation. Despite arriving on time, we were seated an hour and a half after our arrival. Mind me this is after several attempts of trying to get someone to assist us. The service here is awful. The restaurant was severely understaffed and the servers appeared overwhelmed, rude and inattentive the entire time. Our server even forgot two of our orders.

Granted she was on break while we ordered from someone else first, but she stopped by when she came back from break and we asked for our salads from her. Ten more minutes later our entrees show up and Monique comes back to check on us. She asked if everything was ok. We said no, just cancel our salads. She said, ""salad? oh, what salad? The other waitress didn't know about a salad."" Uh.... we told you ourselves ten minutes ago so does it really matter that the breaker waitress didn't put it in the system?  We asked for more water and apparently that takes time as well.

Whether it's an intimate date night or you're coming in with all your coworkers at the end of the night Bj's has something to offer everyone. Bj's is one of those restaurants that was a wide ranging menu that will cater to everyone.      My personal favorite dish here is the seared Ahi salad (yum) if you order the seared ahi salad be sure you read all of the ingredients. The first time I ordered this salad I didn't really read the description fully and didn't realize the salad contained dollops of wasabi so I accidentally swallowed a giant dollop of wasabi thinking it was avocado lol it wasn't too bad but it definitely caught me off guard      A lot of people will complain about the wait but I really don't think it's that bad and I feel like everyone knows how bad the wait can be and it shouldn't be something that surprises you. The only real complaint I have is from the recent visit last Saturday, my date and I were sat at a regular table and this may not make sense to people who don't have tables that open up but the leaf of the table on my dates side kept unhinging and falling into his lap.

We've tried a few things off the menu, and they were all tasty. The restaurant does get pretty busy, but we've been lucky to always grab a bar table. The wait for food is a bit longer than expected, so if you have a timed lunch, try to order as fast as you can!  Besides the lunch deal, they also have a good happy hour.

Cindy E.,"Milpitas, CA",148,4,2,4.0,11/12/2015,"BJ's has been one of my favorite restaurants for years but since the baby was born, this was our first chance to come as there are not many locations near us. Our party consisted of me, my husband and my 2yr old. Although the food was good, it didn't amaze me like it used to. The Buffalo Wings have sauce on them. If I remember correctly, they used to be dry with the dipping sauces (buffalo & ranch) on the side. We liked it better that way. They just taste like any other Buffalo Wings now.  What really disappointed me was my child's food. Luckily he liked it though. Why? Because his Mac & Cheese was out of the box! He has that once in a while at home but I make it better! I cook it longer & add cheese for flavor. BJ's kid meal Mac & Cheese was chewy, clumpy & lacking flavor. I added a pic to the photos section. The BJ's non caffeinated, no fructose syrup root beer was delicious & a big hit with the kid. The chilled fresh fruit was yummy & sweet. The Kid Meal was reasonably priced at $5.75.  The Hubby said his burger was ""good"". The bun was soft & not too ""doughy"". The double patties were grilled to his satisfaction. My Zitti tasted a lot better than it looked. It was delicious. Didn't look like the picture where you can see the pasta poking out of the sauce. When I received it, I saw a little pan halfway filled with crusted cheese. Didn't see the pasta until I scooped it up with my fork. Extremely flavorful. Although it didn't look like a lot, I couldn't finish it bc the oil started getting to me. The oil naturally accumulates at the bottom of the dish and after a while I felt like I was drinking it.  Our server was friendly although she forgot a few important things. She handed us our food without our silverware & napkins. The wait time for the food was great although the wait time to eat the food (bc we didn't have any silverware) was not as great. We still tipped our waitress generously for her smiles, apologies & effort.  Although we received our meals very quickly, it took our Pizookie dessert almost 4x times that wait. It was nice that our waitress came by twice to apologize & explained that they were backed up in the kitchen. We had trouble staying awake as we were so full and just longed to be home since we had quite a drive. Just as we were about to cancel our dessert, we received it. I normally love Salted Caramel everything but the Pizookie flavor was just too much for me. It was too salty & too sweet at the same time. I'll remember to not order that next time. I did love my husband's Peanut Butter Pizookie though!  Overall, we enjoyed our meal. Husband's meal was free as he was a veteran invited for Veteran's Day. I am extremely appreciative of BJ's support of our veterans. I heard about BJ's special meal through Facebook (many friends were having a meal here too) & since it's our favorite restaurant, I decided to surprise the Hubby with this treat. Being a Stay At Home Mother & having a hard working, dedicated husband, we all deserved this special treat on this special day.

Naomi C.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/28/2017,"I went to BJ's on 2/25/17 for a birthday dinner/celebration with a group of around 11/12. This was, by far, the worst dining experience I have had EVER! I mean, I've had better service, experience and food from McDonald's. I encountered the rudest ""manager"" (using this term extremely loose here) I've ever come across in all my dining experiences. Awful! For the large party we had only ONE waitress waiting on us. This is very unusual for a large party especially since our waitress had two other tables and the other table's party was almost as large as mine. While our waitress was very attentive to what we needed and made sure to ask us if we were okay every chance she could, the food she brought out was either wrong, incomplete, cold once it got to us or missing something. After watching this young lady hustle and juggle my table and the other two she had AND watching about three other employees just stand against a wall and watch her, I encouraged a ""manager"" to come over. The ""manager"", Brandi, came over with an attitude and very defensive (unwarranted). I tried to explain to Brandi what was going on and asked if she knew that our waitress was the ONLY one serving us as well as the other two very full parties and, with the great attitude (facetiously stated) she had replied ""I do. So what's the problem?"". The problem is that, BJ's managing style displayed through Brandi, totally caused this young lady to just about fail. This ""managing"" style set her up to fail while other employees set back and watched and nobody tried to help her or display any amount of team work. Brandi, the untrained manager, then stated ""I don't want to argue with you"". Absolutely uncalled for! Argue? Not a single person at my table raised a voice, displayed any amount of defensive, aggression or actions one should be alarmed by, so this, was extremely insulting. Extremely! Brandi proceeds to ask me ""how can I  help you"", I stated, verbatim, ""get her some help"". Her reply was ""I don't do any serving and I'm the only manager here"". I again stated "" Get her some help. I didn't ask you to serve"". What kind of managing style is BJ's adopting here? A manager can't roll their sleeves up and be a teammate? She is absolutely disgusting in this role and should not be one to represent BJ's...at all. This ""manager"" tried to blame our server when it was NOT the server's fault. BJ's manager, Brandi, totally failed her. This managing style totally failed her. The kitchen totally failed her. BJ'S FAILED HER! I am disgustingly offended at the fact that I've freely given my hard earned money to a company that's totally okay failing it's servers. A company that has such a manager in position who can't see past a title and play the actual role. From ONE MANAGER TO ANOTHER: Brandi, you should have played the roll of the manager, pulled up your sleeves, assisted where needed, called a meeting with ALL staff and adjusted so the immediate needs of your customers AND staff were met. You failed both your staff and our party. Lastly, I am, even more disgusted that, the would be celebrated young lady didn't even get her meal and all this ""manager"", Brandi could say was ""I wish this experience could have been better for the both of us"". AWFUL! UNACCEPTABLE! Tell me again how this night wasn't well for YOU when WE patronized the store YOU ""manage""? And received nothing? I'll wait. If anyone wants great service, drive down a little bit on Mowry where there is a Chic-Fil_A. Managers are AWESOME and customer service is extraordinary. In fact, it was the MANAGER at this place that brought me my milk shake. Save yourself a bad time out, AVOID BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=200

You have 3 hosts at the reception desk and yet none show a warmth and friendly welcome, as you would receive from any other family restaurant. I stood in front of the reception desk literally for 2 minutes before the hosts acknowledge my arrival. I was told to follow the hosts, just to find the my table is still dirty and the table had not been properly cleaned. We stood in front of our table with the host waiting for our table to be cleaned. The hosts never apologized and said ""we have been really busy"". I literally looked around and saw less then ten tables with people. I was offended to be lied to literally in my face. Her incompetence to assist is far below the standards of BJ's and I am honestly surprise that management settles for less.  The waiter who assisted us was very genuine and caring. Her upbeat attitude makes me feel like this place as a chance of survival. She shared her recommendations and was patient. The food came out at a decent time and everything was hot and steamy. The crispy flat bread nachos and the boneless chicken wings were my two favorite appetizers. The flat bread was crispy and the toppings are evenly spread. Every bite was an orgasm in my mouth.  If you go t BJ's you are obligated to get a chocolate chunk Pizookie for your dessert. Cookie perfectly chunky and warm. When leaving- the hosts just gathered at the Reception Desk ALL on their cell phones with their heads down. None of them welcomed us to come back.

We got the check and the coupon was not applied and she acted like she wasn't aware of it then proceeded to say that maybe you need a bjs reward for it.

Side note: If you're sensitive to spice, do NOT order the fried chicken. They pour peppered gravy all over it. I ordered the Cherry Chipotle Salmon. It was amazing!

Stephani M.,"Airport Mail Center, CA",607,405,1744,4.0,1/21/2015,"#22 Thank you Nate (my incredible service professionnal) for an awesome lunch at BJ's. I went to Newark to meet a few friends for lunch, and they suggested BJ's, so I met them WAY OUT there.  The parking situation was incredibly awful.  I have to park near the door in the handicap parking area at the moment, but there was no easy way to make that happen due to the construction and the poor signage in the lot.  They have the regular parking area fenced off from what looked to be the employee area.  Okay...I will hobble, whatever.   After fighting my way through the cumbersome parking area, I entered the restaurant and the hostess greeted me in a friendly manner.  I told her I would be meeting friends, but right then I saw them standing up, waving and yelling at me...embarrassing ;(  lol I meandered over to the table with Jociel to meet all of our friends awaiting our arrival so they could order.  Nate greeted us at the table and he remembered me from about 5 years ago at a restaurant nearby...WOW!  (I wish I had that memory, my studies would move along so much faster!) He even called me ""Tall Skinny Vanilla Latte"" remembering that I was drinking one when we met and it was easy to describe the drink because i am tall, skinny and vanilla...but anyway... We ordered a few items to begin with: Corn Fritters Ahi Poke Tuna Artichoke Pizzette The corn fritter were crazy good!  They were hot, fresh and delicious.  Served over an aioli sauce that was to die for with real corn nibblets to garnish the dish.  The Ahi was amazing as well.  A pretty large portion for a small bite share plate, but who is complaining?  The little pizza arrived and it was spectacular!  It was hard to save any to take home... Nate took such great care of our every need, even the two people who arrived late.  I would give 5 stars, but that parking was a fiasco!  If I were the manager I would not only complain but would also seek to resolve the parking issues during the construction.  It really is inconvenient to the guests, especially for guests with mobility issues. Nate gets 5 stars, but BJ's as a whole--4...   Stephani Smiles for BJ's ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=220

The crust is just perfect. The pizookie is bomb. I don't care for the jambalaya and the chicken Alfredo is ok. I guess Alfredo is supposed to be very bland and if you're going for savory not the best. The root beer ribs is honestly one of the best things. Literally falls off the bone. Prices are good because they give you a lot of food. As far as drinks go, I mean if you're going for alcohol at brewery get beer. I'm not a beer person so I thought I'd get the white peach margarita, didn't really taste any alcohol or peachiness and it was about 97% ice.

Jackie G.,"San Jose, CA",12,35,3,1.0,2/18/2017,"I went here a few weeks ago, I have not had the time to review but I'm here now to share my experience. 1St off we had a seat and everything was working out it was after a staff meeting next door and a group of us decided to come eat here. The waitress said we can have separate checks which was great because there was allot of us and we all ordered different price items. The waitress took our order and it took 55 minutes to get our food. We were looking around because we wanted to check on the status but no-one would stop by. We saw that allot of the tables around us were having the same problem. The waiters where by the cashiers chatting away. Finally we started getting our order, and one of our appetizers was not out yet. It came as the last dish and when we asked to take out the second appetizer because it had been like 1:25 minutes since the waiter said the kitchen already made it. We asked to speak to a manager and she tried to argue that the avocado rolls were already made. My couleage insisted on talking to the manager. The manager got there and we asked to get  the avocado rolls taken off the bill and told him about our experience. He was arguing that the avocado rolls were requested as regular dishes and not appetizers. Then three coworkers got the lunch specials and they were charge dinner price. When the coworkers asked the manager about it he called over the waitress and the waitress said they never specified they wanted the lunch special price. WTF!!!! The waitress was this young asian girl and i think she had colored eyes. The manager was a young caucasian guy. Both who were useless and ridiculous.

Kristine F.,"Hayward, CA",447,567,3753,4.0,5/11/2014,"I highly recommend the honey mustard crisp salad (grilled chicken on mine). Mmm chopped greens tossed with honey mustard dressing, chopped hard boiled eggs, corn, cucumbers and topped with tomatoes, almond slivers, and normally crisp fried chicken strips.  For appetizers we usually get the spinach stuffed mushrooms and fried artichokes for ~$5 each! The mushrooms sit atop cilantro aioli drizzle and the artichokes are kinda sour (arrives with ranch). My second favorite dish is the parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The cream sauce is satisfying and not too heavy while the chicken is lightly pan fried.  I prefer the crispy thin fries over the mini potato wedge style; both options are available. As for the pizookies, oh gosh are they indulgent. I got tired of basic chocolate chip with vanilla bean ice cream so I've tried the red velvet and new salted caramel ones. All of them are sweet and take some time to bake so snag your server halfway through the meal to order. Btw, Rosario waited on us during Mother's day and was a great waitress. She was on top of her game and didn't rush when taking our drink orders; she even had time to take all of our orders at the same time (drinks, apps, entrees), which was convenient for our group.

Melea-An A.,"Salinas, CA",469,27,4,1.0,4/8/2016,"I did not enjoy my time here at all. Mainly because of the long wait we had to go through.  We got seated at around 10:30 pm. It was a little busy, but it wasn't super packed. It took maybe 30 minutes for a server to get us some drinks. His section didn't even look super busy! After we got our drinks, it took probably another 30 minutes, or more, for our server to take our orders. Before our order got taken, we were trying to get the attention from a different server so he could help us out, but he completely ignored us and only tended to his section. I found that completely rude. I am also a server at a different restaurant, and I always give my attention to any customer who calls out for me even if they aren't in my section. After we finished eating, our server, AGAIN, took forever for him to give us our check and a to-go box for our food. The manager had to come over and ask us what we needed so she could tell our server. When our server came over to drop off he check and box, he didn't even apologize for the long wait. In fact, he didn't say anything to us at all. He just dropped it off and that's it.  The food was good.

Payal P.,"Union City, CA",40,118,115,2.0,1/4/2016,"This experience is mainly for the service and not the food. Food was fine and pretty normal for BJs but the service was pretty bad. I don't know if it was because the server seemed new or not but it was just not good and I don't know if i'll be back at this location in the near future. Had a table reserved for 8, including 1 baby/toddler. They had reserved a booth but anyone who has a kid knows how fussy babies can get in crowded spaces so a table would have been better? Just to be able to get out in case of bathroom emergencies.  Anyway, so we all sit down and the server eventually comes to us, we order our drinks. When she returned with the drinks, we gave her our appetizer choices since we were still undecided on entrees but just to start the night since we didn't want her to have to wait around forever and be confused. PS BJ's drinks are soooooo sugary. Anyway, we gave her our appetizer choices and asked to have a small pizza made to come out with the appetizers for the toddler since she was getting a little rowdy and hungry.  She comes back a little while later and takes our entree orders. We had a family member who was vegetarian and asked her about more vegetarian options and she completely blanked. I understand it's an extensive menu but I would think it wouldn't be too hard to remember a few vegetarian options since there aren't that many but hey, maybe she just didn't know. Instead of asking someone, she didn't really give us a straight answer and we just haphazardly chose a vegetarian burger since there seemed to be nothing else, at least not that she could remember.  Eventually we got all our appetizers but then.... no pizza. The toddler is becoming fussy at this point and just wants her food. We ask our waitress how long it would be for the pizza and she says ""oh no! I added it to the entree order instead of the appetizer order!"" Let's just say the toddler's parents were not happy. Mind you, there had to have been about 20 minutes between when she took our appetizer order and when she took our entree orders. So did she not put in the appetizer order right away or....? i don't even know but yeah, not cool. The baby's pizza had been cheese with olives and asparagus. When it eventually did come out, it was olives and only the end parts of asparagus. You know, the really hard parts? The ones you would usually throw away because you cannot chew it? Yeah, that's what was on the pizza meant for a toddler. Needless to say, she didn't eat them.  Overall, sorely disappointed with this experience. They were nice enough to toss in a free pizookie for my parent's anniversary but my parents still did not enough the overall experience. I think the should take a little more care when kids are involved because unlike adults, they are not patient. Maybe if there hadn't been a kid involved, we would have been more patient or accepting of the situation. But not when a baby/toddler is fussing and obviously hungry.

There were a couple of times when my food was not at par such as this one time when my fries were cold and my burger was dry as hell. Another time was when I found a strand of hair in my salad, but the manager brought me a new one and didn't charge me for it and even offered to buy my husband and me a drink, so that made up for the hair (eww).

Mars S.,"Fremont, CA",971,410,301,2.0,3/21/2017,"I don't know what it is about BJ's. I've definitely had a handful of enjoyable times at the restaurant, but at the same time, I've also had an equal number of less than satisfactory visits.  Although their food is better than Applebee's and Chili's, BJ's has never wowed me and can overall be completely hit or miss. Sometimes, I'm 100% happy with my meal, while other times it's just completely off. For example, once I ordered the ahi tuna appetizer and it was pitiful, coming out with 3 pieces of avocado instead of having it piled on like the menu's picture. Another time my friend ordered the sante fe salad and replaced the chicken with salmon as she does not eat meat. The salad came out with both salmon and chicken which was odd, and she ended up having to send it back to the kitchen. In terms of service, again, I've had an equal number of visits that it's been just fine and other times where it's been awfully slow. Overall, for the price, inconsistency with food/service, and the always ridiculous wait times, BJ's is not the place I'd suggest going with a friend given all the amazing new restaurants that are popping up in Fremont/Newark. Additional things worth mentioning: - Lots of cool beer options. I'd suggest taking a seat at the bar with a couple of friends instead of indulging in a full dine-in meal with a larger party as that's where BJ's tends to mess up more. - Huge parking lot, but it's always really full. Make sure to not leave valuables in the car as it's an area that's targeted. Thankfully, they have security guards now, but better be safe than sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=40

I came here for my birthday and decided I'd also try my luck coming during dinner hours. Got here around 7 PM and it was definitely packed. I came with a party of 2, so that definitely helped things along. The wait was only about ~20 minutes, so it definitely wasn't as bad of a wait that I bet other people had to wait for. There's plenty of seating available at this location.  If you're looking for some good ol' fashioned American foods, you've come to the right place! They've got pretty much any sort of food you can think of. They've got salads, pizzas, burgers, fries, ribs, steaks, drinks. The list goes on and on, if you can think of it, BJs probably serves it. If she's working during the time you're there, I highly recommend asking for April. She's kind, patient, funny, and all around awesome! I decided to get a drink to start off my meal, and started with the fried calamari as an appetizer. Because it was pretty busy, I expected the entrees to come a little while after so to have some time to enjoy the appetizer. To my surprise, the entrees came out right away! We got burgers and the steak special. All that came out, you can say, pretty much with the appetizers, so we had a ton of food to eat at the same time! Everything was very flavorful and juicy. Despite how busy it was for dinner time, my food was cooked perfectly, medium rare quality and everything came out in a timely manner. When it came down to dessert, we of course got the pizookies! Since it was my birthday too, we were able to get a mini pizookie on the house! We were able to try and mix and match flavors which is awesome when you love sweets and desserts but can't seem to choose exactly the dessert flavors you want! Service was awesome, especially during the busy hours. April, our server, was awesome! She was especially patient when it came to making the crucial decision of what to have for dessert. Not only that, she was also patient and had recommendations when it came to what flavors to get in terms of pizookies. All the food was cooked beautifully and filled with flavor.

I go here a lot because like I said, it's one of my FAVS!  APPETIZERS: -Stuffed mushrooms: 4/5 I have no clue what goes inside these little mushroom but it tastes amazing! Perfect combo of crunch with softness. Only reason not 5/5 is the price. You only get 5-6 mushroom for about $13. I only get these when I'm balling!  -Calamari: 4/5  I love that BJ's give two dipping options for their calamari, fav is the white sauce! Calamari here has the perfect crunch. Same reason for it not being 5/5.... why is it so expensive! Such a small plate for basically the same price as an entree.  -Avocado egg rolls: 3/5  My boyfriend loves these but I'm not the biggest fan. I think it's too much avocado? I'm also not a huge fan of the Asian like sauce, reminds me of sweet and sour. Of everyone I know, I'm probably the only one that isn't a huge fan of these egg rolls.  -Chicken tortilla soup: 5/5 Hands down my absolute favorite tortilla soup, EVER! I'm serious! I love those soup, I've tried chicken tortilla soup at many other places, nothing fulfills my craving like BJ's! ENTREES:   -Blacken Atlantic salmon: 5/5 My favorite! I have no idea how they do it! It has the perfect taste and the sauce that comes on the salmon, delicious! Comes with rice and steamed veggies, great combo. -Chicken Parmesan: 5/5  Usually this plate comes with red sauce. I'm not a fan or red sauce (marinara) but at bj's it's a delicious lemon white sauce! I order extra of that! AMAZING! The chicken is nice and crunchy with the amazing sauce poured over it. Side of mash potatoes and broccoli....... YUMMERS!  DESSERTS:  -Bizzokie aka Huge cookies! 6/5  Cookies and cream is my favorite. But so far whatever I tried is still pretty good as well!  BEERS: They have ""brew house"" in their name, meaning their beers should be good. I agree with that fact! I enjoy their Hefes and blonds. I like their berry cider but I DO NOT like their pear cider.... taste like cleaning appliances.  TIPS- if you know you're coming out name down on their app! Worth it!

I know it says its an open faced burger, but do you really have to but the patty halfway on each bun? Presentation was underwhelming since the over easy egg was too wide and covered everything else. Fries were okay and tasted a bit stale like they sat in the kitchen window a bit too long. Pizza is always a safe bet. Do not get any of the pasta or rice dishes. Pasta is under-seasoned every time. Jambalaya is an exorbitant $17 but isn't even close to authentic and was way too salty. Pizookies! This is the best thing here. They have a supersized pizookie that is not on the menu. For $25, you'll get a giant half baked cookie the size of a large pizza with half a gallon of ice cream stacked on the center. Their alcoholic mixed drinks are pretty good. About $10 each. Service is usually good, but the waiter whose name starts with a K gave us the check way too early.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=40
Nick S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",28,129,12,1.0,8/4/2017,"Went here with family yesterday. Knew there wasn't a lot of vegan options but that's fine. Asked for pasta with tomato sauce said no meat no cheese. Arrived covered in Parmesan cheese and I said is that cheese I asked for no meat no cheese. Guy says yeah it's cheese. I said again that I asked for no meat and no cheese and he then asked if I wanted him to take it back. I said yes. 5 minutes later the manager came out to let me know that the meatballs have Parmesan in them, I tell him I just want noodles and tomato sauce, no cheese, no meat. Dish comes back out 10 minutes later and silently put down. Giant roll covered in butter on top.  I don't mind that there's few vegan options I don't expect every restaurant to have good choices but I don't understand when my order is wrong and they act like it's my fault.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=40

Order everything at once because if you want to place another order, it'll take at least another half hour.  Also, last time we were here for a friend's birthday and after waiting over half an hour for our pizza, the pizza was served cold. What the heck? Of course we sent it back. When he brought it out the second  time, he didn't bring any plates or silverware. We came late that night and there weren't that many tables. If it was busy, I'd understand, but c'mon.

Paul T.,"Moline, IL",29,158,207,3.0,2/16/2015,"BJ's is a casual restaurant chain that does better than most. They offer a diverse menu, craft brews and a full bar. The food is for the most part consistent and the service at this location has improved over the course of the past 12 months. They feature over 120 menu items that include calorie estimates. There are several ""EnLIGHTened"" entrées, salads and lunch specials which range in calories from 460-850. Some of my favorite menu items include: -- Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi (460 calories); oven roasted mahi-mahi served over stir-fried vegetables and roasted pineapple fried rice. The mahi-mahi is always cooked to flaky perfection and the fried rice is almost as good as Benihana's without all the buttery guilt. I suggest asking for soy sauce and Sriracha hot sauce on the side if you want to kick things up a notch !! This dish pairs well with a glass of Barefoot Chardonnay; not too expensive and on point ($5.95 glass/$20.95 bottle.) -- BJ's Favorite Mini 6"" Deep Dish Pizza (~753 calories);  Housemade meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, black olives, white onions, and seasoned tomatoes. I'm actually not a fan of deep dish Pizza in general, but these are good and not particularly heavy.

Rela S.,"Fremont, CA",47,127,74,5.0,1/19/2014,"We came here for the 49ers game and the staff did a great job of taking care of us. On game days they offer happy hour specials throughout the duration of the game. The specials were definitely a great deal and they had a good selection of drinks and food. Some items included: Happy Hour Specials: $4: All BJ's craft beers, Flatbread pizzas, boneless wings $5 House Beers, Freshly Muddled Mojitos, Martinis, Spinach Artichoke Dip, Chicken Pot Stickers, Angus Beef Sliders $6: 4 Different Types of Wines, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Santa Fe Spring Rolls, Avocado Egg Rolls, Mini Deep Dish Pizza Keep in mind the Happy Hour specials are ""Happy Hour-Sized"" so much smaller than their usual portion sizes. I got the flat bread pizza and there where 4 small slices of pizza. It was pretty tasty though. The chicken lettuce wraps were a pretty decent size as well. One other thing to keep in mind is the happy hour specials ONLY APPLY TO THE BAR area. Not sure if this rule is for game days or everyday. But when we went they only offered the specials at the bar. We picked up a few drinks while waiting for our table and brought them over once the table was ready. Overall a great place to watch a game. I think next time we'll just hangout at the bar.

Deborah C.,"Fremont, CA",57,31,3,1.0,1/23/2017,"I'm not feeling the staff or the customer service here at all! A few months ago I went here with friends. We parked next to some guy who was getting high and smoking a joint in the car next to us. It turned out that after we waited a long time to be seated, the guy who was getting high in the car ended up being our waiter! With that being said this dude could not remember anything we asked for, (more napkins, drink refills, silverware, the bill, etc)!!! Bad service. So the next time we tried this place, my husband and I went here around 4 pm. It wasn't very busy. The rude hostess who mever smiled or even acknowledged us demanded my phone number so she could text us when seating was available. Keep in mind there was plenty of seating available. So I did and asked how long was the wait. She said 15 minutes. I noticed several people who came in after us but they were seated immediately and we just sat there like idiots waiting for a text that of course we never received!!!  We walked out. I won't be back. Very rude hostesses who have no skills or training in basic customer service and they have high waiters who smoke weed in the parking lot before coming into work and then forget you're there! This to me is a direct reflection on their management. No one's in charge! No one's watching the store and the employees are allowed to run game on their customers without anyone calling them out on their rude and very unprofessional behavior! It's a nice looking restaurant with a good menu but it will fold soon because of the lack of management or just straight bad management. Pay attention to how they treat you when you first arrive.

Arcie Marie D.,"San Mateo, CA",11,97,137,1.0,8/11/2014,"Back in the day, when BJs was a newer concept, they had major service issues. I feel as though they have made improvements since then, with the exception of the Newark location. I have NEVER had a good experience here. I don't know why I keep coming back expecting different.  I'm in the service industry, so I tend to be way forgiving when it comes to the wait staff. But when I leave this location upset every time, it's not a good look.  My first visit to this location, the manager had to comp the entire bill bc the food came out wrong. We're talking 0/4 orders correct. And cold. And I was never given my drink throughout my meal. Ever. Even after 3 requests.  My most recent visit was no different. Started off with a quote for a 40 min wait. For my husband and I and my infant. On a Sunday early evening. Okay. I guess we'll wait. Then the host asked which I needed for the baby, a booster, or a highchair. My baby's 3 months old. Tiny. So I explained to her that he doesn't sit on his own yet. So neither. (He was sitting in his stroller, not carseat, so I told her i didn't need a sling either) 55 min later, they realized they had skipped over us and said it would only be 10 min more. Oookay. 15 min later (so closing in on an hour and a half wait time. For 2 people) we were walked over to a high top table in the bar area.  First, that area is open seating, so if you were going to seat me there, was there a need to have me waiting for that long? And second, you're going to seat me a high top and expect me to pull up my stroller next to the table? So I'm going to tend to my baby sitting almost 2 ft higher then him? She agreed to get us a regular table. But of course we had to wait a little longer. 5 min later, she was ready to redirect us to our table and asked me to leave my stroller in the lobby. My now sleeping infant son was nestled in his stroller. So obvi I was confused. I explained to you he doesn't sit up on his own. And you can see I don't have him in his carseat and I explained that to you as well. So you're expecting me to pull him out and what, hold him the entire meal? To add insult to injury, she led me down some stairs. With my stroller. Really??  So we established the hostess had no clue what she was doing. But the food. C'mon!!  I ordered a water and a beer. Never receive my water. I ordered a sandwich. And thin fries. No substations. No special nada. Straight off the menu. Still wrong. Wrong sandwich. Wrong fries. My husbands too.  I paid too much money for that dinner to be leaving so unsatisfied..  I will definitely be avoiding this location in the future. Try Bridgepoint in San Mateo.

The real star for me and the ONLY reason I keep coming back to BJ's is for their decadent, divine, and delicious Pizookie. A Pizookie, or ""pizza cookie,"" is a giant freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream, enough to share between 2-4 people. BJ's has several flavors of Pizookie, and my favorite used to be the Red Velvet Pizookie. However it has since been discontinued and for that I am truly disheartened, but I have found a new flavor to replace it. The Salted Caramel Pizookie is so absolutely yummy, and the sweetness from the caramel is balanced nicely by the salt.

Anyway, the large parties were pulling her in every direction, asking for this and that, fixing orders, getting water etc.  So our table asked to speak to the manager, NOT to complain about our server, but to ask if another server could help out and maybe provide better service.  Well I guess this was NOT a good night to ask for the manager because Brandy approached our table with a horrible attitude.  Assuming she was stressed from multiple complaint, just from what I saw (but that's your job right?) We began to ask if there was another server that could help and explained what was going on, she basically ignored everything we said, proceeded to tell us that this wasn't what was going on and so WHAT COULD SHE DO FOR US?  We said get our server some help. Her response was ""well I don't serve, I can't help her and I don't want to argue about it""  Who's arguing lady?!?!?!  Uhmmmmmmm you're the manager, you should be willing to do whatever needs to be done.  Anyway this went on, the service didn't get any better and she basically just stayed away from the large party section so she didn't have to deal with EVERYONE in that section complaining. As a ""Manager"" there was a better way to resolve this issue and make everyone happy.  But, I guess Brandy was just not in the mood to do her job!  The entire experience sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=280

After 10 more minutes just as we start to stand up to leave she finally appears. By then we knew what we wanted to order, forget getting the drinks and coming back!! We gave her our order which included side salads and soup. Someone else dropped the side salads and soup off and rushed off so quickly, we couldn't tell them we had no utensils.

On the menu the fish and chips state that it comes with tartar and vinegar, our plate did not have it. We flagged another waiter down and asked for some ""oh did you want some?"" Ah yeah, it comes with the dish so why wouldn't we want it? Half that meal was ate by the time we saw those two items. I started to eat my chicken which the breading was over cooked and hardly had any lemon sauce, it was luke warm while the mashed potatoes were cold.  Even after getting our meal our server did not stop by to check in on us. She walked by and we watched her fawn all over several other tables that were all seated after us. We did not receive a refill on our beverages and in the end had to ask someone else to get our check after sitting there for awhile. Our waitress brought over the check and then wanted to know how things were. When we said we were never offered refills she asked if she could get us any, ""I'm leaving now chick!!"" She then wanted to know how everything was. Told her all our issues with our food and with her and not to expect a tip. And that is exactly what happened, no tip. I could see if it was busy but it was not at all.  The place is no longer worth the hype. I will head over to Union Landing or Pacific Commons. It'll be interesting to see what happens when all the new restaurants open at the mall later this year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=280

The bartender didn't seem to be busy at all, and if that was genuinely the case, why have only one bartender on call for dinner?

Javier P.,"San Leandro, CA",290,501,1782,3.0,5/8/2013,"I've been here 3 times already. The first time I came with my food buddy. She had told me that if we called ahead we could make a reservation. being that it was a Tuesday night I didn't think it would be busy. So we walked in and it was PACKED. We asked for a table for two. Our wait was going to be 25 minutes. In reality it turned out to be 35 minutes.  As we're waiting for our table I asked for a menu. The way I see it is that if you're going to be waiting 35 minutes minus well get a head start by looking at the menu, right? I do this at every restaurant :) Once we decided  on what we wanted we wrote it on a piece of paper. When we got our table and our server introduced herself. We handed her the paper where we wrote our order.  By doing so we sped up the process of getting our food.  As always we ordered the avocado egg rolls for our appetizer. 1st time here I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich. The grilled chicken was so juicy and tender. In other words it was well made. Well stuffed with avocado with pepper jack cheese, ranch dressing, chipotle mayo and roster chili peppers. I forgot what kind of bread it came with lol   2nd time  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad. It had green onions, tomatoes, black beans, jicama, corn and bbq dressing, mozzarella cheese and crispy onion strings. I didn't like this dish much. Mostly because it had more lettuce than anything else and it didn't have much chicken. I wasn't going to pay extra for extra chicken. 3rd time I ordered the Crispy Jalapeño Burger. With 1/2 pound of angus beef, cilantro, lettuce, tomato, pepper jack cheese, red onions, baja sauce, chipotle mayo and fried jalapeño peppers made this one SPICY burger.  I must of had the spicy batch of jalapeño peppers that day. I kept asking for water lol I don't have a favorite dish, yet. I'm satisfied just by ordering the avocado egg rolls as my main dish. It fills you up and every bite has avocado  and has the right amount of spiciness.  One thing that bothers me is why the appetizers take FOREVER. 15 to 20 minutes. I don't know if they're always short handed in the kitchen or if they make the appetizers from scratch. If they do then that explains why it takes time. Nice restaurant to hang out with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=280

When the server came by I asked to see the happy hour menu and he told me happy hour wasn't available in the dining room. We were already seated and told that they could not do happy hour outside the bar. The whole reason we came early in the evening was for happy hour and then we were seated where it wasn't offered.

Carolina A.,"Palo Alto, CA",107,16,1,2.0,3/27/2015,"So tonight we came in to celebrate my little sister's 16th birthday ( we were only a party of 4) But we called in ahead of time/early just because its friday and we knew it would be busy. We only waited 15-20 mins which was AWESOME! Our waitress was really nice and wonderful and took our orders and brought our drinks in a timely matter.  But why the two stars? well, the birthday girl ordered a burger and it only came with ONE bun. Two young girls came to give us our food, one of them almost hitting me in the face with the plate that was given across the table ( I'm a calm person so I just ignored the rudeness) and the other gave the birthday girl her plate with ONE bun and said"" unfortunately you only have one bun"" and then left. I looked at my sister just to clarify with her that we actually heard that right. Then I thought, ""oh maybe she went to go get the other bun"", because, you know, we ordered a burger, and last time I checked, burgers came with TWO buns. But the girl never came. And at this point my blood started to boil.  But my sister (being the sweetheart that she is) tried to just go with it and attempted to eat it, but today is her birthday and being her older sister, I was NOT having that. Our waitress finally came back and I relayed the appalling event that just occurred. She was shocked, apologized quickly, and got my sister a bun. I cant say I've worked in foods or can deal with the things they go through, but I don't think its difficult or rocket science to put a bun on top of a effing burger.... I really appreciated our waitress and I appreciated her apology even though she was not at fault. I hated that she felt that she needed to apologize for something that she did not do. So waitress, YOU ROCK! I wish your co workers had the same work ethics as you do.  And to the management, Please train your staff on how to deliver good customer service, IDK how tired you might be, there is no excuse for such rudeness.

The server slipped and now my friend and I are covered in spicy hot sauce. our ties , shoes socks, all smeared in the bright red shade of rooster sauce.

Though it was quite dark, it was very lively inside with a lot of TV screens, and families, and friends dinning, and the place was very big. A lot of people may find this annoying as orders may tend to be slow, but our waitress was very attentive and made sure our orders were taken and delivered promptly. I also like how diverse their menu is, there's always going to be something for everybody. We ordered all appetizers for dinner. We tried the Sliders, Chicken Wings, Crispy Calamari, and Chicken Lettuce Wraps. The Sliders and Crispy Calamari were yummy, but nothing out of the ordinary. I felt like you could order the same thing else where and it would taste the same. The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were also just okay. It was tasty, but I felt like it could have tasted better. I wasn't really impressed until I tried the Chicken Wings, which we all loved! It was /that/ good that we needed to order another plate to share! The skin was crispy and the meat was just moist and it easily slid off the bone. You know chicken wings are good when they don't need to be dipped in sauce! For dessert we had the Cookies n Cream Pizzookie-- chocolate and Oreo cookie that's a size of a small pizza, topped with Vanilla Bean ice cream, caramel syrup, and chocolate chips. This was reeeaaally good! I love dessert, but the not-too sweet kind, and though this may sound like a mouthful of diabetes, it wasn't! The sweetness was just right and I really enjoyed eating this down to the melted ice cream.

A lot of times, if your seated at the tables your food will come out at different times then the person you came with. Pictured here is the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and a quinoa salad. I thought it was going to be good so I ordered an extra pita taco. Unfortunately it was not good. There was no flavor and it was very bland, not to mention the order was messed up as well.

Madhur B.,"Stanford, CA",190,225,489,5.0,3/3/2014,"Man, I love this place. I find the general food style to be very similar to Cheesecake Factory, with the vibe being a bit more upbeat. I really don't understand how they manage to make the incredibly simple concept of ice cream on a cookie taste so unbelievably delicious.  My recommendation:  Cookies & Cream. That whip cream with the ice cream and cookie is the greatest Peanut Butter Original Chocolate Chunk Aside from the desserts, I'm a BIG fan of the food as well. Some recommendations: Avocado egg rolls - Similar to Cheesecake factory's, yet somehow distinct. Love it.  Chicken Teriyaki - I honestly enjoy this more than teriyaki at any japanese restaurant I've been to, and I'm not ashamed to admit that Chicken Parmesan - See comment above, swap japanese for italian. The marinara is actually seasoned (and a little spicy), which I love.  Balsamic Glazed Chicken - The chicken is always cooked perfectly, and the fried onion strings adds a great crunch",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=360

They've had it going on for like four years...) they had to like re-arrange the parking lot  completely. So now a giant, empty lot has been reduced to a few parking space up front then the rest cut off in an awkward loop further away from the restaurant. It's really inconvenient&weird. My family&I came when the place wasn't really busy but we still had to wait (even though there were empty tables everywhere). I was torn between the Atlantic Salmon&the Angel Hair Classico. I chose the Angel Hair. I regret everything. The sauce was literally water. It was like they forgot to take the noodles out of the water that they cooked them in then threw some cheese&vegetables on top in an effort to make it better. It just made it worse. It was probably the worst pasta I've ever ordered. The noodles weren't even angel hair - they were thin, tiny, &not even long. It was like someone cut the noodles into quarters then put it back in the soup water. It was gross.

Once we were seated, we were asked immediately what we wanted to drink, of course we say just waters for now because we haven't even gotten a chance to look at the menu.  After a few minutes, we finally place our orders.  I ordered the rib eye, medium rare, with a wedge salad and baked potato.  For my drink I got their strawberry patch.  My friend ordered the jambalaya.  My steak was cooked perfectly, however, the seasoning was bland or nonexistent.  I had to add my own salt and douse it in A-1 sauce and horseradish.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.  The portion they gave her was huge and she was only able to eat half of it.  My drink tasted just like strawberries, but the alcohol content seemed very low, kind of tasted like I was just drinking a strawberry lemonade.  I don't like my drinks super strong, but I'm paying for an alcoholic drink, it should make me feel kind of warm and fuzzy. Now, on to dessert... if I could give the rating on just the Pazookies alone, I would give it 5 stars.  I mean you cannot go wrong with fresh baked cookies topped with ice cream.  Can you?  We ordered the trio with chocolate chunk, double chocolate, and macadamia nut cookies.  OH SO GOOD!!  I should've ordered a glass of milk with it, but I was too full.   Our service was just ok.  The server was very nice, however he was a little slow and when we needed him he was nowhere to be found.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=360

We called ahead of time [45 minutes] to reserve a table for 10, but they said reservations were booked, although they don't take reservations much earlier. The boy and I rushed over after congratulating our friend. Luckily, they had a no-show, so they had a table for us. We only had to wait for about 30 minutes, which was how long it took for our friend&the rest of the party to show, anyway. The staff was super nice about our friends taking awhile to come. It got reallyyy busy about 10-15 minutes after the boy&I got there, which was understandable [graduation season]. Anyway, our waiter was pretty nice and brought out waters for everybody promptly. Took us awhile to decide what to order, but we had fun waiting for the food. However,  the food definitely took longer that I thought it would to prepare. Appetizers were decent [pesto chicken flat bread, tortilla chips with artichoke dip, potato skins].  The boy&I ended up splitting a medium Great White deep dish pizza. Price was alright, and the pizza was definitely more than enough for us [we had 3 slices left to take home]. I was so disappointed in it, though. Compared to the legit Chicago Pizza that I've had since I last was here, it was.... mediocre. The crust was soggy, the flavor was bland [I needed ranch! On an Alfredo-based pizza. What the heck!], and it was just... okay.  Pizookie was still delicious, but gotta bump them down a star for mediocre food. Oh, and there's nothing really brewed at this ""brewhouse.""

They had a weeks notice about our party of 30 and clearly did not prepare. After being seated one waiter took our drink and appetizer order and then I guess he left so after a half hour we finally tracked a server down who took drink orders again and then promptly forgot what we ordered. The manager was clearly overwhelmed and did not have a handle on the restaurant. After the waiter brought half of the drinks we ordered and forgot what the order was that he took 15 minutes before he then proceeded to argue with our table that he didn't take that order the other guy did and he just got here. We reminded him that we just gave the order to him. I don't know if he was high or had a learning disability but he was not all there. When the dinner order was finally taken needless to say we were a little nervous and with good reason, as the dishes started coming out things were not what we ordered and there was more confusion. To top it off the man paying for the dinner did not get his food.  After the third time of being told it was coming the waiter finally admitted it was given to somebody else.. wtf. There was no offer of compensation for the bill which when finally tallied was 1,296 a good gesture of the manager would have been to take 10-20% off the bill.

The place is pretty big and can get pretty packed around dinner time. Lunch would be a great time to go since it won't be as busy as the dinner crowd. This is a great place to celebrate someone's birthday like my friend did. She had the beer sampler. LUNCH Lunch is great here because they have awesome specials that are discounted. I got the club half flatbread pizza and side salad. The pizza was the perfect size that was cut up in smaller slices. There was chicken, avacado, cheese, tomatoes and onions and it was sooo good. The salad was a nice addition and it was all for $8 or $9. I couldn't believe it because dinners are always pretty expensive. Definitely worth coming here for lunch. DESSERT PAZOOKIEEEEEE. Sometimes I just want to go to BJs for the Pazookie. If you don't already know and you have been missing out, a pazookie is a huge baked cookie with ice cream on top. An individual size can be split with 2 people. You can also get the sampler with three different flavors, such as oreo cookie, regular cookie, and red velvet. I wouldn't recommend the other crazy flavors because the regular cookie is just plain delicious. If you really want to YOLO with friends, I would get the PARTY SIZE PAZOOKIE. You can literally split it with 5 others because there is so much cookie and ice cream. The cookie is thin, warm, and gooey and the ice cream scoops just belong with it. Eat it quickly though or else you will have melted ice cream on your delicious cookie :( **TIPS** 1) Lunch time is the way to go if you want cheaper food. 2) Celebrate any occasion here and they will definitely accommodate you.  3) If you come here for dinner, prepare for a 30-45 minute hour wait. 4) GET A PAZOOKIEEE. 5) Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=300

Mystery M.,"Fremont, CA",307,536,32753,3.0,6/17/2014,"After my experience here at BJ's today for lunch, I just had to write a review update. I came to take advantage of their FREE Pizookie Day that they've posted all over the web on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their Website. At first, I was slightly confused on how this works. While heading to BJ's, I put down my name on the ""Prefered Waiting List"" using the BJ's App. When we got there the hostess, who was really nice, told us that there was going to be a 10 minute wait. No biggy there, it's BJ's there always going to be wait. The hostess was about right, it was only about a 10 minute wait. When we were finally able to get a table, we were sited in a booth, ones that were meant for 2 people. The hostess had asked used if that was okay and we said yes because well it was meant for 2 people and we had 2 people in our party. It took a while before our waitress came to assist us and take our order. Which was to be expected because BJ's is always so busy no matter what time you go really. When our waitress finally came, she apologized for the wait and for taking so long to help us and take our our order. Our poor waitress seemed overworked and really tired of waiting soooo many different tables. I felt kinda bad for her because she had to wait so many tables. We ordered our food  and then I had asked her about the FREE Pizookie offer that was going on today because of #BJsFreePizookieDay and she told us we had to order it online using the BJ's App because it was a pre order thing. So, after she took our order, I went online using the BJ's App and ordered the FREE Chocolate Chip Pizookie and it was scheduled to arrive at 1:30 PM. The waitress had confirmed that the kitchen had received our order of the Pizookie and that was great and all. The Pizookie came out at 1:20, ten minutes early than it said on our order but you'd think that would be okay right? Well, no in this case it was not. The reason for the deduction of a star was because the Pizookie came out 5 minutes after our entrees arrived, therefore, I wasn't really able to enjoy my entree at all which was a BJ's Mini Lunch Special Pizza. I couldn't enjoy my Pizza because I didn't' want my Pizookie to become hard nor did I want the Ice Cream on the Pizookie to melt. That was the sad part of my meal today, that I couldn't enjoy the Pizza because of the Pizookie coming right after the Pizza came. Even our waitress was like ""OMG, the Pizookie came out already? ""They sent the Pizookie out already"". ""The Pizookie came out right after the entrees."" She did apologize for that as well and told us that ""usually the pre orders come out pretty quickly"". At least next time, I know not to pre order the Pizookie until after my entrees come out so I can at least enjoy my entree first lol. But it was FREE so I guess I can't complain too much... Also, the Clam Chowder that came with my Pizza (you can choose from a variety of soups) was pretty good. I like the Clam Chowder Soup, it was full of rich flavor, clams and potatoes.  The Pizookie was still good, and our waitress was nice and apologized for the mishaps that happened today. So,  just one star knocked down, now a 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=300
Jasmin V.,"Fremont, CA",64,2,,1.0,1/28/2017,"Just got home from having dinner with my son tonight and I'm feeling pretty upset about my service. My son loves this restaurant so I decided to take him to dinner there tonight. On the website there was a coupon for a free pizookie with a purchase of 9.95 or more so I was excited to redeem it. Our server JESSICA was friendly but when we asked about the free pizookie she got all weird and asked us to show her the coupon. I pulled up the website on my phone and showed her the coupon and she stayed staring at it for a while. She finally said it ""worked for her"" but when she gave us the bill it had still charged us. I let her know that we were still being charged for it and instead of just fixing it for us she made us feel super embarrassed and said it's probably because we weren't signed up for rewards or something. She just really didn't want to honor the coupon for us and we felt super embarrassed so we just paid for it and left. It's not even about the money, it was the fact that she made a big deal about a coupon that was on the website. Workers there should know the promotions going on and not make their customers feel embarrassed just for trying to use a coupon.

Jeff C.,"Fremont, CA",189,249,138,3.0,6/15/2014,"This is our go to place for decent American food chain.  We came here recently to watch a World Cup game and the bar area was packed with fans watching on the 4x TV screen.  Typically, there's always a short line here because its so popular.  BJ has a rewards program thats good for small rewards like free dessert if you eat there often.  Happy hour half-off prices for food means half portions.  So its not really a deal.  The prices for appetizers are above average, so next time I would just buy an entree. While watching the game, we got a Jerry Burst pitcher, which is easy to share with the ladies.  Also got fried calamari, avocado rolls, and regular buffalo wings.  They were all very good but probably could give me a heart attack.  The bartender checked in on us periodically through the game and was very relaxed.  All-in-all a great place for a sporting event.  Its OK for general dining though since the food quality and value is hit or miss from my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=300

Queena T.,"Oakland, CA",74,35,25,5.0,11/11/2016,"Perfect for any game day! Delicious pizzas and yummy delicious appetizers. I always tend to get their appetizers or finger food because that's one of the best, safe, comfy food to me. By all means, you can try other food as well. This is just my preferences. Don't remember much about their pastas, but it's not that bad. I found a new favorite pasta, but I forgot what's the name of it. It's like a pizza, but in a pasta instead and it comes in a pot. Great services here, checks up on you every 10 minutes or so and keeps refilling drinks. They always make sure we have a wonderful time, satisfied with our food, and experience. And if you aren't satisfy with your food or they made it not to your liking, they will try to make you another one. No, this doesn't mean you get free food. They will simply replace your food. Don't be greedy! So excellent on customer services. And all the employees there are friendly. Sadly, there's no reservations. The line can get very long and you have to wait at least 45 minutes just to be seated.

Ben H L.,"Santa Clara, CA",303,1561,73,3.0,2/23/2013,"I came back here with two coworkers to try them out again.  In some aspects, the meal that I had here was a lot better but a few things bothered me like my experience last time. First of all, my meal was way better.  Once again, I ordered off the lunch menu and got a lunch portion-sized of the BJ's Cobb Salad for $9 along with a side of Tomato Bisque soup for only a $1 more.  The soup portion is quite large so it's quite the deal and there's plenty in there to share with someone else too.  In terms of taste, the soup was decently seasoned although I wish it was a bit more creamy.  The BJ's Cobb had turkey, bacon ,avocado, and bleu cheese dressing mixed with romaine lettuce.  It's a chopped salad so the lettuce as well as the other elements on the plate so don't expect leaves of romaine on the plate. Secondly, like last time, there were a few service issues that were a bit irritating.  Unlike last time, we got our food and drink orders in relatively quick after we sat down.  I ordered iced tea for my drink and I noticed that there was no sugar on the table nor was there an offer to bring me lemon with some sugar with my drink.  It was a bit surprising as I didn't think that I needed to remind my server that I wanted lemon with my iced tea...that's something that I expect my server to ask me.  My server also didn't smile during our whole experience too...I know that's sort of nitpicking and that everyone can have bad days and moods but I used to be in the service industry too!  Flash that ""fake"" smile for me!...don't really want to see a grumpy face from someone who's waiting on me. Overall I still enjoyed my meal with my coworkers and it was an improvement overall since the last time I was here.  Hopefully the next time I come here, I hope the service aspect of my meal improves a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=300

On what seemed to be not a crowded day our did not bring us plates zero napkins and never checked in on us for refills on drinks unless we flagged him or any other employee working. I've gotten coffee and asked for creamer and never got any. But what was the worst part was when we paid. We had a sizeable group of about 5 and we paid 10 dollars over the due amount. After waiting for about half an hour we had to leave since we work the next day and it's about 10:30 so we had to reach the front desk to see where our change is and they had told us he left.

Lydia H.,"Milpitas, CA",213,64,33,2.0,5/20/2015,"Two words to summarize my review: understaffed and inadequately trained.  This place has really gone down hill compared to my previous visits from previous years. I know service had always been slow, but at least they were always nice about it.  We came at around 9:30 sat at one of the round tables near the bar after we got the ok from the hosts. We proceeded to wait 10 min- no menu. So we got our own menus back at the hosts stand. 10 more min- no server greeting us or asking if we wanted some waters. Some type of acknowledgement would've been nice.  Another 10 min passed so we decided to order from the bartender ourselves. The rude and snobby bartender looked at us impatiently and took our order. We sat back down and voila, our server appears. I'm not going to bore you with the rest of the waiting details, as you probably have an idea from reading the rest of the reviews from other yelpers, but it continued with us flagging down the server for the basic necessities because he was obviously too busy and overwhelmed.  We understand his pain, both having been in the hospitality industry, so we gave our 20% tip and bounced.  This place really needs an upgrade in food and service because it's not what they used to be. The beers and atmosphere are still great, but probably wouldn't come back again.

Simon F.,"San Lorenzo, CA",51,500,3314,4.0,2/3/2014,"My wife and I had lunch here on Saturday (for some reason, my wife didn't want to eat at a strip club). We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated (you're given a black pager if you have to wait). I was nice enough to go outside (this freed up a sofa for a family to use). The flies that were trailing me soon followed. Our hostess was friendly (my wife just noticed that she was wearing too much eye shadow- maybe she was trying to look like a wolf). We were seated in the large room on the left (the only other time we were seated there was during the grand opening). I had to ask for place settings. The tables weren't fully set up yet. Our server was young and clearly new. He was also light (he could get blown away by a stiff breeze). Anyway, he was attentive, but annoying (I found him to be a major pest at first). We left him a nice tip ($9.81), but I have to say that it was because we didn't have any singles (our total was $50.19, and so a tip of $4.81 would have seemed a bit harsh). At one point, a manager came by to check on us. He was nice, and was in the area a lot (a group of about 10 suddenly arrived- they were pretty loud). As usual, I enjoyed the songs playing inside (ex: ""Chloe"" by Grouplove). : The TV at the bar was turned to 4 different things. It was dumb, largely because only 2 games were on. (My wife groaned when I had us switch seats. I wanted to face the TV that was closest to us.) : If you redeem 150 points, you get ""$10 Off Any Meal (excludes alcohol, gift cards, tax and gratuity)."" Note: All prices include tax. : My Pink Lemonade was $3 (there are free refills on soft drinks). : Mozzarella Sticks ($8.67): 9/10. My wife and I each had 4 right away.  Our mozzarella sticks, as usual, were wonderful. My wife likes the marinara sauce too, but only had a little. BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich ($11.94- the price was $11.25 in 2011): 8/10. My wife is always pleased when she orders one. She ate her sandwich quickly and received a good serving of wedge-cut seasoned fries. : Pepperoni Extreme (Mini- $11.45): 8.25/10. I should have ordered a Small (for $15.21). Still, I was very pleased overall (I could have received more pepperoni, and the edges of the crust were lightly burnt). Next time, I'm going to try BJ's Hand-Tossed Pizza: ""Our delicious thin crust is lightly brushed with garlic butter and topped with the perfect combination of bold tomato sauce, our signature five cheese blend and your favorite gourmet ingredients, then baked to crispy perfection."" : BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger ($8.67): 8/10. They're new. Description: ""On a grilled bun with Applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, tomato, lettuce, pickles and our special burger sauce."" I didn't receive any ""special burger sauce,"" but that's cool with me. It kind of fell apart, but my patty was very tasty. My crispy-thin fries were pretty good (I just had to add some salt), but somewhat cold. If we weren't pressed for time (my parents were watching our son), I would have complained about them. My bun was nicely grilled, and my cheese was delicious and gooey. I only received 2 strips of bacon, but they were quite meaty. : BJ's Famous Pizookie®: White Chocolate Macadamia Nut ($6.49): 8.5/10. Our Pizookie was a shade overcooked, but otherwise delectable. The scoops of vanilla bean ice cream were bigger than normal. Regular pans were used in the past (tin pans are now used). The Pizookies here were a bit better in the past. Still, I highly recommend them. I laughed right before we left. A guy got hit in the head by one of the revolving doors. He wasn't paying enough attention (he was embarrassed, but otherwise fine). The parking lot should be fixed up a bit. It's pretty ""ragged."" For the most part, my wife and I really enjoyed our food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=300
Andrea P.,"Hayward, CA",237,2,1,2.0,12/21/2015,"A girlfriend, S and I were out spending the day Halloween shopping and dinner got pushed back because of it. We found refuge at BJ'S around 10 pm and stopped for a late dinner. My salad and wine were amazing. S, however did not enjoy her salad. When we told the server, I think her name was Melissa, she very hesitantly offered to take it away which made S feel uncomfortable so she kept the salad and never took another bite. We then proceeded to order our meals. When they came out, S's meal had been prepared entirely wrong which was immediately visibly apparent and we voiced it as such. The food runner apologized and excused herself to fix it. I then started on my meal to find that my Spaghetti and Meatballs(which I specifically ordered without chili flakes due to an allergy) was COLD. I called over Melissa and explained my problem. She then proceeded to stick her fingers into the plate of Spaghetti right in front of me at the table. As a server myself, I was appalled! She offered to have a new one made and I obliged.  In the meantime, as we're having these problems, the manager, Brandy(?) Is standing in the to go area as Melissa acts as our messenger between management and the table. And what is Brandy doing? Putting away boxes and chatting. S is a restaurant manager and I have worked closely along management as a server for years. We were both extremely shocked to have not been visited by a manager at this point.  So, time goes by and we receive our remade meals.  S's comes out wrong yet again, and mine has chili flakes. I take one bite and I'm on fire.  So, we call over Melissa yet again. Tonight just isn't our night and we'd like to pay for what we enjoyed from our terrible experience and hit a drive thru somewhere.  She makes a trip back to Brandy and returns to our table with a check charging us for everything and still no visit from Brandy.  That's when I asked Melissa what the manager's name was.  Only after that did we get a visit from her. She walked over, already familiar with our situation and started going on about how busy she is and how she's the only manager and how she's stuck doing to go's. NOT OUR PROBLEM We sat in disappointment watching her for at least 20 min waiting for a visit before we actually received one. And her ""being so busy"" entails talking and laughing with her subordinates and putting away to go boxes and bags. I have always enjoyed my excursions to BJ'S and make a point of visiting several of the locations in the bay area frequently.  To say the least, S and I were extremely disappointed with our experience and I feel extremely hesitant to return. ...

Service was prompt and efficient all the way through my time there.   Especially considering how busy it was.  Food was just OK. I had a rack of ribs with a Caesar salad and roasted asparagus.  The ribs were pretty good. But the salad was just a bunch of lettuce in a bowl with bottled dressing on it. Asparagus was just put under a broiler until charred. No seasoning of any kind. Neither side was bad. Just nothing special.  Almost an afterthought to the meal.

If I could give zero stars, I definitely would. The only reasons as to why I have been here in the past is because it is close to home and at a convenient location.  The very first time I went here, the service was unbelievably bad. Our waitress continuously got our orders wrong and she even wrongfully brought our condiments to another table. We ordered a pizza without sun-dried tomatoes and when we got it she actually omitted all tomatoes, fresh and sun-dried. She barely apologized nor were we compensated for their mistake.  Another time I went, I ordered a bake potato and my boyfriend ordered a sandwich. We waited for 30+ minutes when our server finally decides to come to tell us that something went wrong with their potatoes so they had to throw everything away and start the cooking process over. As soon as he finished talking, he walked away. He did not ask if I wanted to order something different nor did he offer to bring out my boyfriend's sandwich first. The waiter never apologized nor did the manager. Ten minutes later, our food came and it was mediocre.    The food is honestly not amazing for the prices that they charge and the service is impeccably poor. People dine out for the experience and of course the food too, but this place has neither to offer.

Just like any other BJ's Restaurant, the place has full bar access, booths, and tables. This place in particular has a long wait time on a lot of times I've been here. There were times when we left because the wait was too long and it was already late.  We were seated quickly this time. Our waitress came quickly and provided us with menus and waters. We scanned through the menu and decided on two appetizers and an entree. We got the chips with spinach dip, buffalo wings, and chicken pasta with angel hair. We also got two drinks: your typical Stella and a raspberry cider. The food came pretty quickly and we chowed down right then because we were so hungry. The spinach dip was so good and it warms your mouth. The dip was thick, but in a good way. The buffalo wings were great and the portion was huge! It also comes with celery and carrot sticks. The dipping sauce for the wings was a little weird for me. It was a spicy liquid-y hot sauce. The pasta was so delicious! The angel hair spaghetti was cooked well and the white sauce was great! The chicken was also very tender and juicy. Maybe I was just hungry, but everything was really good. I definitely recommend the raspberry cider though! It's one of the sparkling ciders so it's not even like alcohol. It just tasted really fruity and nice.  The service was also good. Our waitress came and checked on us many times to make sure that things were going great. Other servers dropped by and asked us how we were doing as well. I don't come here much often, but the food is good whenever I come, so I am satisfied with this place. I will most likely be returning one of these nights. It's pricey, but it's expected for these kind of restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=380

That was fine because the food was good. And you can't end the evening with out getting dessert. We ordered the trio of pazookies. We chose chocolate chip, triple chocolate & my favorite peanut butter but with a twist they were trying something new. They placed Jam in top of the cookie so it tasted like a PB & J sandwich.

Rita K.,"Union City, CA",617,593,299,3.0,5/15/2013,"A solid 3 stars. There may be a wait during dinner time, especially on weekends, so I recommend making reservations ahead of time. The food here is okay, but the pizzas are really good, especially the buffalo chicken one! I recommend coming here during HH after work (I think it ends at 6pm) for half off mini pizzas! Their HH specials for drinks aren't that much of a discount, $1 off drinks for the most part. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I've been here a bunch of times over the past few years and I never had a problem with their food. I recommend buffalo chicken pizza, cobb salad, and their wings. The 5 pepper wings (extra hot) isn't that spicy at all, so all you spicy lover freaks would be able to eat it with no sweat. The pizookie is what BJ's is known for. Delicious melted cookie with ice cream on top dessert... mmmm. Might come here for my birthday for the free pizookie.  We watched a Warriors playoff game here once near the bar, we had to call in advance to reserve one of the tall table with stools and got a great view of the big TV screen.

The service here is always really slow and it takes a good 40 minutes just to get your appetizers,  to find it cold and not even worth eating. The food is okay but I can say 9 out of 10 times something is wrong with it.  And don't get me wrong I'm not the type to be picky when ordering or asking for ""everything on the side"" but it's usually that one thing you don't ask for will be on your plate. For example my birthday a couple years back a ordered a pasta with no meat. My plate finally comes out and not only did I find a peace of sausage in my pasta I also found a peace of plastic.

But they got me: free Pizzookie if you download the app and order on the app!!! I don't know if I've ever downloaded an app faster... So I committed the great sin of deliciousness, and headed straight over. When I went to check in at the restaurant, I swear the hostess saw me, thought of greeting me, then decided against it. The manager had to nudge her, then she finally greeted me and got me seated. I told her about my order that had already been placed, and she told me my server would be out shortly. Okay... So I waited forEVER for a server to bring me WaTer and verify my order. They took a long time AGAIN to finally bring me my Pizzookie.  The Pizzookie wasn't amazing, but it met my expectations at least - slightly over cooked but otherwise still a big cookie with ice cream. :) The best part? When I told the manager how bad the service was he did not care AT ALL!!!

Second disappointment - ordered appetizers during happy hour and it was good but when we ordered more, we were told it would cost more since it was no longer happy hour. No problem with that. What was disappointing was when we were told that the portion would also be bigger because it was at regular price. Been to a lot of places during happy hour and always price was cheaper during happy hour but the portion was always the same. So happy hour price is not a big savings at BJ's since they also short you on the portion. Very disappointed in that little trick.

I came here with a couple friends to watch the Warriors NBA Finals game. As expected, the place was crowded. It didn't seem like they had prepared for the rush as when I walked in they told me they only had 4 servers for the entire place. I didn't know how I was to respond to that, so I sat anyways. Between my friends and I we ordered a couple drinks, appetizers, and pizza from the happy hour menu. We got the drinks and appetizers, and 45 minutes after we ordered our pizzas still weren't here. I knew it was crowded, but this was too long so I asked the waitress to check on the food. She comes back 15 minutes later with two pizzas. She hands me mine and said it had been sitting out for awhile, because somebody dropped my friends' pizza on accident without telling anyone. She claimed they had reheated mine and gave it to me and brings out some other pizza for my friend, a different one than the one she ordered which was really odd. My friend sent it back because the pizza she brought out had pork, which she doesn't eat. And my pizza was cold! Even though she said she reheated it. I sent mine back to be heated AGAIN. Finally she comes back with my pizza and the pizza my friend had ordered. But since mine had been reheated so many times, it was soggy! It literally felt like they had just put it in the microwave it was gross.  Finally when the bill came, she charges us the regular price for all the food and drinks instead of the happy hour price! That was really frustrating, and is a huge mistake. When we told her she wasn't very apologetic and just said she would talk to her manager. Especially when going during happy hour, make sure that people double check their bills as the servers don't seem to be doing their job properly. This place is understaffed, and the waiters they do have are incompetent. They really need to get better.

The sad things is I keep seeing they're giving other people with a party of 3 and more a buzzer to let them know their table is ready but they didn't give us a buzzer. The couple who was in line before me had already been seated long time ago and other people with buzzers already been seated and we are still waiting.  45 minutes later and we are so hungry, our names had not been called yet. We decided to wait an available seat at the bar and when my hubby finally got one, we decided to just eat there. So after an hour we finally got seated at the bar and got our order taken immediately. I have BJ's two starts for the waitress who served us with a smile and for the waiter who cleaned out the table so we can seat and eat.  All in all the hostess needs to do more training about customer service. Other than that food is good. Won't be dining again at the Dining hall but would eat at the bar only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=460

Tiffani H.,"Mountain View, CA",2,1,,1.0,12/29/2014,"Turn around don't do it. This was the worst dining experience I've ever had. Horrible service and apparently normal car break ins in their lot.  Every year we have friends fly in from Southern California. We decided to try something new and go to Bj's. Never again.  Here's a summary:  **The manager very casually comes to our table and asks if anyone drives a VW... And then says ""oh ok because it just was broken in to"" and walks away. We found out from the bus boy that car theft  and break ins happen 2-3 times a day In their lot. Hello jerk...WARN YOUR PATRONS!!!!!  It took 15-20 for anyone to come to our table. (The place was not at all packed)  Only half of our 25 person party was brought waters/offered appetizers Our waitress kept forgetting our orders(write it down dummy)  The guy bringing out the food was rude and kept yelling at us, throwing our plates on the table: his shirt was dirty and untucked , he was not happy to have to be at work. Very unprofessional.  The orders kept coming out wrong.  We weren't brought napkins until the end after several requests.  Water refills never offered.  Very rude response to the car being broken in to.  Absolutely the lowest level of customer service I've ever had and on top of that....THE FOOD SUCKED. don't do it people.

At least not in the 4 TVs right in front of the bar.  :(  When I asked the bartender about the Sharks game he pointed towards the TV on the side of the restaurant, nowhere close to the bar.  So basically if I wanted to watch the game I was going to have to get a booth or table in the dining area.  I was definitely not hungry nor did I want to wait an hour to get seated!!!

It did take a little while for our server to free us but once she did she was amazing and attentive. Unfortunately the chef of the night wasn't up to par. We ordered the cheese sticks and calamari as appetizers. A individual sweet pig pizza, a burger, chicken salad and a pasta. My fiancé ordered his burger medium rare and received a medium well. My pizza was extremely limp and didn't have any pizza sauce! I think the recipe for the thin crust is not a good one as it was extremely soggy. Typically I get the deep dish which is so good. Anyways, the server had my pizza remade which took about 10 minutes. The second go around it had sauce but again soggy.  The manager came by and comped my pizza. Which is much appreciated. Only complaint about the server is the fact that she did not let me know root beer was not free refills and they were 3 bucks a pop! However, one of my rootbeers was also comped so I ended up paying just for 1. We still left the server a 20% tip as the meal was not her fault. Having been a server before I really appreciate the fact she got a manager involved. So many times I've gotten the wrong meal or soggy or something and servers just don't care and don't offer anything.

We asked to speak to a manager and he came over 20 mins later, and said he was completely unaware of the situation.  Gave it another chance tonight and all we ordered was the pizookie trio. 20 mins after ordering they let us know they were out of the peanut butter pizookie.

Order the thin and crispy fries because they did not put enough on your plate to satisfy you. My boyfriend ordered the burger with bleu cheese and bacon (which was gross to me because I hate bleu cheese). He ordered it with wedges and it looked like they put a handful as this huge plate was mostly barren. I'm pretty sure this was a mistake though as I saw the next table over receive a burger and A LOT of wedges.

Yelp'y Yelper T.,"Fremont, CA",1,81,96,3.0,5/23/2014,"TGIF: Beer times are good times :-).  Always packed with sparsely open seating which is good, can find a spot even when busy.  Service is typically really good as the servers are cool and quick at what they do. Food always taste good but has 'upset' some bellies a time or two.  In one instance in March 2014, all the people at our table enjoyed the meal but got violently sick through the evening and into the next day. Because the meal impacted all of us we contacted the location and the managers comments were basically ""well, it happens, nothing I can do about it"", no apology or offers to make it up were given.  It didnt seem like he cared at all that our ENTIRE table got sick, kinda seemed like a normal occurrence for him.  Three calls (and messages) to corporate went unanswered, seemed like no one cared about us all getting food poisoning. Regardless, we keep going back for cold beers and good times, but are WAY MORE selective of the things we order, mainly Avocado egg rolls and flat pizza apps. My main gripe is that they call themselves a ""Brewhouse"" and the don't brew beer at all. Every drop is private labeled brewed for them by Saint Arnold brewery in Texas. Having mock serving tanks in every location is totally unethical, borderline fraud.   They deserve 2 stars but will be nice today and give them 3 because we enjoy the ambiance and meeting our friends there. Plus they are better (and slightly safer) than Jacks Brewery across town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=420

Maria C.,"Fremont, CA",0,59,,2.0,9/25/2014,"BJs. Where to begin? Well, first there's the name. We'll leave that for a site that won't chuck this review based on it's user policy :) We've been in and out of this BJs for over a year, and while I fell in love with this chain in Boulder, CO, it's not the best here. Why, you ask? Noise ------- the noise level in here is off the chain ridiculous. We've canned it from our moms-night-out list of places to go because even yelling, we often can't hear each other. And I don't want to yell at people I like. I'd like to yell at the wait service, though. Wait Service -------------- Listen. I get it. You're underpaid, supposed to make your cash on tips, have too many tables, and I'm sure some of us customers aren't as nice as the others. But seriously, don't help make the situation worse, cuz, as they say, it's the little things. Like when you bring a tray of 4 drinks to the table but 3 straws. And then say you're sorry, you'll be right back with one. But never come back. Or, when you come to the table with hot soup, but there's no spoon. And say you'll be right back with one. But then proceed to take the order of the table RIGHT BEHIND US. You realize we can hear you, right? We can see you, right? That's just a slap in the face, in my opinion. It's like saying, ""You know, Mr Customer, I know you can't order your own soup and get it from the kitchen. So I'm going to let that HOT dish sit in front of you and grow colder by the minute, until I damn well feel like getting a spoon for you."" YOU set the expectation - YOU said you'd go get it... and yet you don't. For 9.8 minutes, on average, over 4 visits. Yes, it got so bad that we'd TIME YOU over MANY visits and chuckle as the $20 bills passed hands, bets collected and cashed in, winners and losers announced, as we gambled on how long you'd be gone. You want a tip? Give me service. You want a good tip Give me good service. You want a great tip? Well, you get the idea. The Food ----------- As a first time reviewer of you, but long time eater in your chain, I understand that I'm emotionally scarred from your chain's decision to pull the stuffed baked potatoes. I admit, I was a bit miffed when I was told that, after WANTING to pay for a $10 potato (come on, let's just say it, we all know it's really worth $1.50 in costs), that you're complaining to me about the time it takes the kitchen to prepare it. Which tells me the kitchen isn't looking to cook, they're looking to reheat. Which brings me to the last point - the food quality is OK, for what it is - but it could be so much better, particularly when the menu is priced squarely in the average range of $14/item, $20-$22/meal. And when we leave? Yup, you guessed it. My man wants to visit McDonalds, because he's still hungry. Quality -------- I want to end on this final note. You are what you serve, in the restaurant business; a lot of times we'll put up with crappy wait service, or rude wait service, or NO wait service, if there's good food and drink. However, you sold me a roughly $4 cream soda with no carbonation. After asking for something with bubbles, and being looked at with incredulity (because, you know, customers take a perfectly fine glass, drink none of it, and send it back for fun, and you, you decide you're the soda police and want to question my word, despite seeing not a single bubble on the side of the glass), take 15 minutes to work it out with the bar, who tells you there's something wrong with the batch, and there are no more batches. OK, I'm disappointed, but things happen, I get it, let's move on. Imagine my surprise when I saw more trays of bad-batch soda being served to other customers. It's a small thing, I know, but for a chain making it's name on the every-so-hot marketing monikers of ""Hand-crafted"" sodas, it tells me that you knew there was a problem (despite how we got to that discovery), and continued to serve it anyways. Which makes me wonder about what's on my plate. EEKS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=500

Avacado egg rolls were.... Different,  but not in a bad way. Drinks were either too strong or too sweet, Pizza was mostly dough and although the dough was good the toppings and sauce just didn't have enough flavor for my liking.

It was that or the calamari but I also wanted to try the calamari so I got that instead. The ahi poke will be the reason I come back for a second visit. My sis in law kept talking about now delish their pizzas are so she ended up getting that to share with my boy. Before ordering my meal, we got munch on the calamari and I thought it was really good. Not too crunchy but not to soggy either. I decided to get a regular veggie burger. First bite... I was satisfied. Only pet peeve I have is when restaurants serve you burgers and all the insides (produce) are served on the side. Next time I think I'll mention for them to put together for me.

In fact, the only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the lack of competition BJ's has for late-night grub. The wait for your food is always a minimum of 30 minutes, no matter how busy the restaurant is. The food tastes fine, but is also quite overpriced for what you're getting, and you're really paying for the nice ambiance and the TVs.

Louisa T.,"Fremont, CA",182,700,269,4.0,9/30/2013,"Thank youuuuu google! When we looked up BJ's on googlemaps, a coupon popped up for BJ's, $20 for 2 soup or salads, 1 medium pizza and a pizookie for dessert. Can't get better than that. Amazing deal if you ask me. My husband and I ended up going with 2 other friends and we both got a chance to use the deals, thanks to our waiter checking with his boss to make sure we could. As a group we shared a pitcher of heff and original wings to start off, and I thought the wings were delicious. I would definitely come back for those wings and the pizza.  The salad was limited to ceasar or house, which I was ok with. My husband ordered the chilli soup which I think he enjoyed, and we shared a medium spicy meatball pizza, and it was spicy alright. It was definitely the jalapeno type of spicy where it burns your mouth a bit. Delicious flavor however, and I like that the crust and presentation on the serving plates was like a deep dish pizza. This is a crust you can eat on it own. (medium pizza for 2 and we had left overs to take home) I haven't been here in a long time, but I do remember their scampi pasta being super delicious as well. I'll have to go back and verify that. The oh so famous pizookie... warm cookie topped with ice cream was delicious as usual, but a tad too sweet for my taste now. I think I'm getting old. But my friend ordered the red velvet (I didn't even know they had different flavors now!) and I ordered the cookies n' cream one. The cookies and cream was on a delicious (but overly sweet chocolate cookie which I normall love if it's not too sweet) topped with vanilla ice cream and cookies n' cream whip. The red velvet seemed less sweet, and tasted ok.  As for the seating, when you walk in, everything to the right where the bar was is free for all, first come first serve. We went there because we really wanted to watch our football games (both Stanford and Cal had games going on, half an hour apart) and thanks to Bj's big tv splitting 4 ways, my husband and I were quite content that we were able to watch our games while enjoying our meal (we called in advance to make sure they were going to play it before arriving).  The menu here is great with a wide selection of foods (and beer- their samplers are fun) you may enjoy, and I have to admit our server this Saturday by the bar section was terrific! Great service.

Their Jeremiah Red is one of the best Red Beers around, but when it's Oktoberfest time I get even more excited.  Their pizzas range from the classic to the creative and are cooked Chicago style, although they're recently added flatbreads, thin crusts, and even gluten free!  A note - pizzas tend to take a little while to make...especially ones in pans so be patient! Their pizookies are so delicious, from the classic chocolate chip to the seasonal ones like rasberry white chocolate almond.  A FRESH baked cookie, warm and topped with ice cream...YUM! When they have the 2 for $20, I always try and go - two salads or soups, one medium pizza, and a pizookie to share - it's perfect!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=580
Karen T.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/31/2016,"Poor service. Forgot to bring the salad before the jambalaya. Asked for no rice and yet it appeared under the jambalaya. Switched servers after ordering due to a server leaving their shift which we appreciated. However not one server came back to see what we thought of the meal. Over spiced jambalaya as well. Poor parking too, with the need to circle the parking place several times.

Derek B.,"Atascadero, CA",1,23,5,4.0,7/15/2014,"Was looking to try this location near our new home and once we were finally accepted after trying once or twice, found it's not half bad! PROS: -Expansive menu with great food options, something akin to Elephant Bar. -Pricing is fairly decent, there are definitely ways to save money if you make good choices. -Nice atmosphere, kind of like a younger and trendier PF Changs or Elephant Bar. CONS: -Busy, busy, busy. We've walked up to this place on more than one occasion and we're told there was a 1-1.5 hr wait, wow! You're not allowed to call in ahead of time to get a reservation either, perhaps after a certain time maybe. -Given that it's busy, the waiters attention can be seriously compromised. Our waiter had issues coming regularly or when needed and would sometimes walk away before an order or request was fully resolved, strange! -It's a fairly loud atmosphere, especially around the bar area. Sort of a great place to go if you want to have more than a few drinks, talk loud, watch the game, and be merry...just be wary if you're thinking to bring certain people. -My spoon or fork was super dirty with a huge chunk of something on it...something nasty but I forget what it was...we told them but there was no consideration given...we even had to bug them b/c they forgot to replace. So yeah, the customer service CAN be lacking although more visits are needed to resolve an opinion. Hoping to try again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=580

Ravi C.,"Austin, TX",55,277,16,3.0,9/18/2013,"Don't see a point in writing a detailed review for a chain restaurant... but here we go... It almost feels blasphemous eating at a chain in the bay area given the options we have here. We stumbled to this place after laughing mad at the made up theater and at that late hour, starving we were in no mood to search. So, we came here. (gee!! I sound so apologetic!!) For Drinks we ordered IPA(liked it), a Mohito, a Long Island(no one offered me a taste) and for the teetotaler a cream soda( tasted it and it was wonderful).  We ordered the Avocado rolls and Mushroom bites(Don't remember what it's called) and they were good. Only down side is the sauce that comes with Avocado rolls. It's too sweet and I don't think it goes well with the rolls. Instead I asked for Cholula  hot sauce,which I think is perfect match. We ordered a large Vegetarian Pizza for main course and finished it real fast. I am very prejudicial when it comes to Pizza. The only Pizza I like is NY style pizza with very few toppings. So, when everyone wanted to order Pizza... I said yes but was very cynical about it. But for once... they were right and I was wrong. The Pizza was amazing, not NY style but the crust was fluffy and the flavors were subtle. After devouring the Pizza we ordered a Pizokie trio with Red velvett, white chocolate Macadamia and cookies and cream. They were okay... but next time, I am going to order only the single flavor version. I think because of the tininess of the cookies, they were not soft and chewy anymore.  The service was great and the food was enjoyable.

Dora C.,"Fremont, CA",778,227,35,2.0,9/17/2012,"Every time I walk into BJ's I feel like the hostesses are very reluctant.  It always seems like they notice you right when you walk in, but then react only 2 mins later.  Quite frankly, it makes me feel pretty awkward, because I'm just standing there looking at them while they look at me.  However, once they acknowledge you, they are usually pretty quick with seating!   Normally at these types of restaurants, I always get pasta, but for some reason BJ's pasta isn't very good!  I'm not the only one who thinks so, because all my friends agree with me as well.  I recommend their burgers,  I got the bacon cheeseburger the last time I went.  All the burgers come with a side of fries.  I was extremely satisfied with the burger I got.  Their meet is USDA, and it's just really juicy and big!   As for pizookies, if you want to just eat one by yourself then I recommend the mini ones.  I recommend the peanut butter and cookies and cream one.  My friend also said that the red velvet pizookie is really good!  The one that I don't recommend is the chocolate one [triple something?], it's waaaaaaay too sweet! But yes, normally people come to BJ's for the pizookies, so definitely order one to just try! So the reason why I give this BJ's 2 stars is because of a particular experience I had once about a year ago.  I came with my friends [5 girls], and being in high school, we don't have that much money!  Anyways at the end of our meal, we all split the bill and paid in a lot of fives and ones, but one of my friends paid in quarters!  Since it was a lot of quarters, we decided to make the waitress's job easier by putting them in piles of four, however, when our waitress saw the money, she was super pissed off, and demanded one of our parents [who wasn't even dining and only there to pick up my friend] to take all the quarters back and give her bills.  I thought this was super rude of the waitress, and I mean money is money, does it matter if it's coins or bills? In conclusion, I honestly feel like BJ's is only worth going to if you're craving pizookies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=580

For dinner I got the Chicken Fried Steak with white cheddar mashed potatoes...I LOVE chicken fried steak but there wasn't enough of the white gravy, and sadly the steak was a little stringy. I still enjoyed the meal, since luckily they give you a LOT of food so I just cut around the crappy parts. The mashed potatoes were really good, but the veggies they serve were bland and plain.  I was way too full to even think about dessert! They had a nice (but typical) selection of them from the menu.

Now an hour passed and then they said 58 minutes..  (we are a group of 10 and the table were waiting for had 30 people, but regardless a restaurant should not give times as a statement if they are unsure..) I ordered the New Orleans jambalaya. It was pretty good. My best friend didn't recommend this because when she had it, it was really oily and greasy. I found it to be fine, but a little spicy maybe for some. Also I got the Pizookie in Red Velet. It was really good, but really sweet even though I have a sweet tooth. My boyfriend on the other hand doesn't like things too sweet so it wasn't something he could even eat half of.  There was a 17% tip for our group.. thought it should be only 15... but it 17..  Waiter service: didn't do much, took forever to get our bill when we were done, she made a mistake but eventually that was resolved with a wrong dish. (Every server differs, but it wasn't a crazy night for a Tuesday) Would I go here again? maybe.. but, it's not that special.  My boyfriend said the burgers are like D&B burgers in case anyone was wondering. My friends said they would go back for fries, boyfriend said they were like potatoe chips. Only bad thing is they put either hella salt of MSG in their food.. I had to drink a lot of water that night, my boyfriend got up an had 3 FULL GLASSES of water.  Great thing is that they do call you in case you decide to go around since buzzers don't walk further distances. Parking looked hard for some, but I manage to get a spot, it wasn't too bad.

Honestly, I could get the same quality of food for cheaper at Chili's, Denny's, etc.  For me, service is really important. I'll continue to go back to a place if the people who work there provide excellent service, but this place is lacking in that area as well. I always experience slow, bad service when I'm there.  I have to admit that I like the interior of the restaurant and I feel like it has a good atmosphere. So I guess I can kind of see why people go there. Especially if they love beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=540

Henna P.,"Fremont, CA",98,282,222,4.0,11/7/2011,"This place is right by my work and has become the default Happy Hour watering hole on Fridays. I think their drinks are over priced, but the cocktails are yummy :9  The portions are a good size so I always end up with leftovers to take home. I recently shared a large Portabello Mushroom pizza with 2 other people and we each ended up with an extra slice to take home. It was very tasty! I hate the parking lot. It's the most poorly designed parking lot ever. Seriously. Whatever moron designed it needs to go back to parking lot design school. The layout is terrible, there are weird bumps and dips all over the place, the spots are different sizes, and it's just like a really bad maze because there's no flow to the design. It probably doesn't help that Mervyn's went out of business and there's nothing else open in that plaza.

Erin W.,"Cape Elizabeth, ME",87,29,11,4.0,4/15/2013,"So, in a slight variation on the Valentine's Day tradition my wife said,""Well, you can get a steak, at BJs.""   We ended up doing other things that night and never made it out there. So, when the in-laws popped in over the weekend and asked if there was anyplace we wanted to try for dinner, we decided it was time to try BJs out. Our party was seated quickly on a busy night and our server popped in for drinks right away. I wanted to get food ordered for the boy first thing and our server was happy to accomodate. I write that, because many servers out there develop severe brain freeze when I try to order food before the drinks. She saw the logic and made it happen. Wifey loved her sesame salad, In-laws liked their food, turkey burger and shrimp & lettuce wraps. I prolly was the least pleased of the bunch food-wise. I ordered a burger with bacon and cheddar, thinkin it would be a safe bet. Safe, sure. Great, not so much. The burger looked formidable at first glance, but was found out to be a thin pattied wimp. There was about 3 inches of lettuce and several tomatoes hiding about a half inch of burger and 2 anemic bacon slices beneath. It tasted fine, but I will pick something else from their extensive menu next time. There will be a next time. The service was great start-to-finish and the space is more of a loud restaurant with a few TVs than it is a sports' bar so it seems well suited for families.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=540

Hahn N.,"San Ramon, CA",2,43,6,2.0,4/19/2016,"Definitely not my best visit unfortunately. I decided to take my kids to lunch before some fun activity and arrived around 2:30.  The hostess took us to our table and after that we didn't see a waiter for ten minutes to take our order for drinks or food. Our waitress eventually showed up and attempted to take our order but she failed to listen to us as we had to repeat ourselves 3 times. She left and we doubted we were going to have the right drinks but she got it after all. She took our food order and had really bad attitude as if we were an inconvenience to her and what she was doing. The food came and my sandwich was super dry. The toast was burnt and the chicken was dry. I ordered the wedge salad which resulted in a bath of dressing which ultimately ruined the meal in the long end. I've had this same meal now twice and for going on a busy Saturday dinner with a great experience to this on a dead Friday lunch time, pretty upsetting. Our waitress checked on us about 10 minutes after someone else brought out our food. Again the tude... Then she went over to the wrap around booth next to us full of young guys with the most energetic greeting and made flirtatious talk. We later learned it was another employee and his buddies. Another waitress joined her as they all talked. She then came back with her tude to see if we needed anything else. We ordered two pazookies and she looked at us like we were crazy to want to order them. She dropped off our tab and went to her buddies at the booth for more flirting.  Our pazookies arrived, we ate them and I left the worse tip I've ever left anyone. Feeling guilty but the service wasn't even tipable.

Were told it might be a min. We checked in again at 6:20 & had to wait 10 more min. It was obvious they had lost our reservation especially after we were finally brought to our seating. We were cramped & overcrowded, against a wall.  we're a big family,  so we're used to it.  They brought complimentary cheese sticks to apologize within 5 minutes of seating us,  but didn't take our drink order for another 10 min. They forgot 4 out of 6 requests for water.   Then 10 more min to order.  By then we were getting very hungry had been there almost an hour, so we ordered 3 more apps & all our entrees.  They brought the apps but no plates, we had to ask 2 times.  I sent a drink back because I didn't like it. I had ordered it, but it was very sweet.  The server brought me something else right away.  Our food came at 7:30,  most of it anyway. They had forgotten to order 4 entrees,  & had made 1 entree twice. They took that back.   I later found out that my grandaughter had ordered one kind of soup but had been given another. (It was her birthday.) I asked why she didn't tell us. She said she was just too hungry to send it back.  I asked if she liked it, she said it was not her favorite but she didn't care.     About now you must think we're a bunch of complainers and eventually we did all get fed. It just took so long lots mistakes.  I had the salmon it was sooooo good. The manager was very kind,  he came over personally & apologized directly to me, then comped my salmon dinner.  After all the mishaps I certainly appreciated that gesture.  We left about 8:40. I've heard in Europe things are done at a very leisurely pace,  perhaps we melded into a worm hole for the evening.

We just had to order what was necessary for  celebrating a congratulations/going away occasion: - Buffalo wings with buffalo sauce on the side - Artichoke dip - Blue Moon beers - Hennessy shots  The buffalo wings were crispy, yet tender. To control the heat of the buffalo sauce, we had it on the side because not everyone could handle the heat. The artichoke dip was nice and creamy. It was served warm and made our tortilla chips taste great. I didn't drink beer since I can't have any, but I did have my fair share of Hennessy shots.

We had some drinks, a standard vodka tonic cocktail for me, and beer for my gf. We decided on the artichoke dip as an app, she went with the balsamic chicken with potatoes and I wanted to venture out from my usual avocado rolls and called on Yelp for recommendations. The white pizza was the first to get a recommendation so I went with that.  It was good and the mini size was perfect for me. Matter of fact, I took half of it home for lunch the next day. I prefer the Buffalo Chicken Pizza over that one. And the Balsamic Chicken was tasty. My gf finished her dish without a problem. The dip app was small. Not enough dip for the amount of chips that they give you and for $8. The other patrons were very friendly.

Priscilla F.,"Fremont, CA",129,53,9,3.0,2/8/2014,"Long story short: Food was okay, service was not.  Went here last night with a few of my friends and our server was originally a guy named Chris. But since he was going on lunch or leaving, another server took care of us named Nayeli.  She seemed nice at first but first impressions can be deceiving. She took our orders and visited the table ONCE before other servers delivered out food to the table.  She hardly checked on us and didn't even refill our drinks. The wait to get our food was RIDICULOUS!!! It would've been a little better had our server checked on us a few times but she didn't.  When we finally got our food, we didn't even finish because we waited so long. My friend and I split a bacon chicken ranch pizza which was pretty good, another friend ordered fettuccine Alfredo (basic) and another one ordered a margherita fresca flatbread or something like that (chewy bread). After dinner, we ordered dessert. About 15-20 minutes passed before we got our dessert and it was the wrong one and again she didn't even bring it to the table, someone else did. We told the server that our dessert was wrong so she took it back to the kitchen. About 2 minutes later, Nayeli brings out the dessert that we just rejected and said that another server took our order, the kitchen is making another one and to just eat the one she brought out again while we were waiting. Seriously? By this time my friends and I didn't care because she wasn't being the best server anyway, plus a free pizookie is a win for anyone.  I don't know if it was because it was Friday or whatever but service was pretty bad. Waited forever to get our food and they couldn't get our dessert right.  I enjoy going to BJ's but it really depends on the server you get. It might be awhile until I visit this BJ's again.. This is the third time I've received bad service there.

So when the hunnie suggested we try the one in Newark, I was game.  We have driven past it many times, and every time it was packed. But we went at 3:30 on a Friday afternoon and got a table immediately. The decor of the restaurant was awesome.  The bar looked nice and we'll stocked.  The place was clean. Overall appearance was great. Service...meh. We were seated and it took about 10 minutes before our waitress came to take our drink order. It wouldn't have been too bad if the place was busy,  but it wasn't.  We ended up placing our orders...we got the fried calamari, he ordered the Bbq pulled pork sandwich with their crispy fries,  and I ordered the new roast beef dip with wedged fries. The calamari breaded and deep fried and served with a lemony tartar-like sauce and a spicy marinara sauce. It was good,  crispy, but a little oily. They could have drained it a bit more. His pulled pork was pretty good. The pork was tender and the flavor was intense. The coleslaw that came with it was warm,  and I didn't like that.  The fries, well, they were fries. My dip...it was awesome! The roll was toasted.  There was a good amount of beef on the sandwich. The Swiss cheese was perfectly melted. The au jus had a lot of flavor. The wedged fries seemed to have a coating on them and were fried crispy, which I liked. The meal itself I give 4 stars. Then came dessert. We ordered the white chocolate macadamia pizookie.  It came out within 5 minutes and looked amazing. It was served with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream.  We dig in and it was delicious! It could have been cooked a tad bit longer, I think, but the flavor was just yum. We finished that fast. When we left, the place was crowded, and it wasn't even 5:00 yet!

Kenneth L.,"Fremont, CA",23,32,9,3.0,2/16/2015,"This would be a 3.5 stars review if possible. My friends and I went to watch the NBA All-Star game there. We sat at the bar tables and had the carnitas fries with chile verde as well as a large BJ's favorite pizza. The ambiance is nice. It's definitely a nice place to watch games with friend. The massive tv at the bar area makes watching sports pretty great. The waitstaff is nice but generally very busy. This means that they'll take awhile to come back to you and ask you if you need refills or are ready to order. That's really because BJ's always seems to have a fairly long wait (the bar area less so than the restaurant section). All in all, this place fits the criteria of a nice place to watch a game. The food and drinks are what you expect of BJ's. Decent food but fairly pricey. The carnitas fries were good, a little bit too much salt in there though. The carnitas were tender and the chile verde complimented the fries and carnitas well. This was probably my favorite thing I had there that night. The BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza was pretty good as well. Not the most amazing deep dish pizza I've ever had but definitely a good pizza. It had a little of everything (sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, olives) and the flavors blended well (obviously, because its essentially a combo pizza). The crust was quite addicting (I'm not a crust guy either) as the dough was crispy on the outside while still maintaining that nice chew in the middle. Again, this was pretty salty, so if you don't like salty foods you should probably stay away from this place. For my drink I had the root beer (because I wanted refills.....we were there for about 3 hours). I was tempted by some of the alcoholic drinks but ended up getting the root beer instead. I'll probably come back to try some of their alcoholic drinks. As for the root beer it was definitely one of the best root beer I've ever had. They come in a frosted mug (essential because it keeps the root beer cold while not diluting it with ice) and unlimited refills (I had about 5 rounds of root beer).  All in all, I spent about $17 (including tax and tip) for this meal. Not horrible because of what I went there for (decent food, drinks, and watching the all-star game with friends) but definitely not cheap. I would definitely come back once in awhile to watch some sports with my friends but probably not regularly or even semi-regularly. My PSA for this place would be that I did slip into a salt-induced food coma after getting home. Be forewarned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=560

This particular location is by far the largest of the BJ's I have been to. The restaurant to me gave off a classic 1920's look with a contemporary edge. We called ahead to avoid a rather large wait time and got seats right away!  To start the night off right, my party ordered the  ""choose 8"" beer option. This gives you the chance to try 8 different beers. Its probably about 3 beers in total (double shooters) and really helps you learn what types of beers you like. We ordered the artichoke dip which was pretty good, not spectacular, but the beer made it just right.  Our meals were cooked well and fast. I ordered a spicy pasta which only tingled. But the flavor was good in general.  Our server and host were both extremely friendly and made us feel like we were VIP's which made the evening really memorable.

You can also get a free birthday sized Pizookie if you sign up for their email list. Not bad. The prices are ok. I think it's on par with most other chain restaurants. One thing I noticed this time around was there was an odd smell near the bar. It smelled like rotten cheese which made me think of going to a different location next time around.

We were seated in the 20 min wait time.  But when we went to our table, it was not wipes clean from the previous seating.  When we pointed that out to our server, another young girl, she went up to the congregation and yelled at them.  They just watched her disinterestedly.   Then she came back, said she was sorry, that there were no silverware and napkins for us to use, and went to find them. She did not try to clean the table, or send anyone to do this.  The congregation was back to just that....their conversations.  Later, she returned with the napkins and silverware, after the appetizer had arrived and our hands were dripping with the sauces. When I ordered my glass of wine, which came in a carafe, she poured it for me.  The problem?  She did not pour all of it.  In fact, she gave me a awkward smile, and took the last remaining bit with her!  What gives?

Robert H.,"Milpitas, CA",11,63,14,4.0,2/4/2013,"BJ's in Newark is tucked in at the 880 Mowry interchange, so eyes open or you will miss it. The parking is shared with a dead Mervyn's store and the lot is so chopped up that you don't want to navigate it while tipsy. Parking is somewhat of a problem for a brewhouse that pushes large and tiny glasses of beer. This place is busy all the time, so you'll be parking a fair distance from the entrance in the Swiss cheese parking lot. The fare in BJ's is tasty and the service was attentive and prompt when we went on Saturday afternoon. Seating is in booths or at tables and televisions showing sport events are spread all around. The food is of that saucy, cheese-filled, bready fried variety. It's similar to what you find at Yardhouse. There are very few plates on the menu with fewer than 1200 calories, and if you drink beer, well, maybe you should fast for a few days afterward. Even their light menu, which is maybe 6 items, hovers at 600 calories each. The Newark establishment is smaller than the one in Glendale, but the overall effect is the same--trendy high-cal food and fresh beer served in comfortable, stylish surroundings. One note: the paper napkins delivered with the food are cocktail-sized.

I called the order in and the guy said it was enough for 1-2 people, but seriously, this thing is barely enough for 1 person. Maybe more for a kid. This thing was tiny! For $13 you're better off getting a Costco slice of pizza. I should of gotten the larger pizza but I assume that would have cost me over $20. No way worth what I paid.  I'm giving them 2 stars for staying open late and the staff is friendly but for today's experience was a huge turnoff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=600

The waiters that assisted us were friendly and very flexible (as in they did what ever we asked). The presentation of the food was excellent and a work of art. The taste was even better than presentation with various flavors overwhelmed my tongue in the best way possible. With a hint of spice, my guacamole-bacon hamburger was built to perfection. My meal never fell apart when I lifted and bit it. For desert we got the trio. In the trio, we got the salted caramel, triple chocolate, and original. The Salted Caramel was my favorite for its flavor enhancing ingredients. The triple chocolate suppressed my chocolate craving from the whole week. The original was a sweet taste of the past, having a sweet, warm cookie under a nice cold vanilla ice cream warmed my coldest memories. With all these incredible perks overrun the fact that a pepper shaker loosened up and spilled a mountain on my siblings Parmesan Chicken. Overall it was a pleasant and fulfilling experience and will recommend to anyone who asks to have a relaxed evening and great food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=600

We were served by bartender Cory who was very fast and took care of us. The Giants vs. Reds Game 1 of the Division Series was on, and I was so happy so be front and center in from of the big screen. The crowd is loud and definitely folks who are seasoned drinkers. My friend and I ordered a flatbread and potato wedges to go with our drinks. The food is ok. It's bar food. I don't expect much. You need those carbs to hold down the drinks. What's nice is the alcohol selection and what they have on tap.  The bathrooms are nice, the floors are clean, and the service is fast.

If they took reservations seriously, instead of whatever list they do that doesn't save you any time but makes you feel like you were saved a spot.  4. Their service was reasonable...even below average would be fine...but it's horribly slow and they forget everything so if you're picky, you're kind of out of luck.  5. Their to-go wasn't so slow and they stopped forgetting things all the time and then tried to give me ice cream to make up for their mistake when I catch it.  6.Cheaper food.  Food is on the pricier side for this type of chain joint. You can definitely eat cheap here if you share.  7. If it wasn't so crowded and loud. There's nowhere to stand if you're waiting, and the bar area is always full.

After being introduced to our server we ordered since we had ample time to review the menu, our server disappeared for another 20 minutes so we asked the manager to fulfill our drink order.

Albert C.,"Milpitas, CA",9,16,5,1.0,3/23/2014,"Absolutely disappointing. Decided to give them a few tries before writing my report but after giving them the benefit of the doubt a total of four times, I can easily say they have failed to redeem themselves, and in fact, worsened in quality each and every time. The first time I came here with a friend the wait was alright. Maybe 10-15 minutes, which is quite understandable. I ordered a jalapeno burger with the patty cooked rare. I cannot say how long I waited for the food because I was engaged with conversation with my friend, so I will not comment on it just yet. However when the burger did arrive, my hopeful expectations for a rare juicy beef patty were shot down by a well done. Now I have made my own burger patties before, I can easily say...rare does not take a lot of work at all. When someone is willing to eat their meat rare, please understand that they mean it. Anyways, I told the server the issue, and although they offered to take it back, I declined. Why? Because 1) we had a movie to catch, and 2) I simply don't like wasting food. Ate it, disappointed and disgruntled, but still, tipped our server 15% simply because it was not his fault, and he took the appropriate actions to correct this mistake. Second and third was I was here with co-workers on lunch break. Lunch rush wasn't too busy. We were seated immediately. However our server was harder to get a hold of than the metaphorical needle in a haystack. He sat us down, told us he would be back to take our orders shortly. Our timeline was we arrived at BJ's at 12:00PM on the dot. We did have have our orders taken until 12:20. I did not dare order the burgers again this time. Instead I got the simpler lunch special, sandwich and soup with a side of fries. Much less disappointing as I see less of a chance to screw up a sandwich, soup and fries. However they did give me wedge cut when I wanted thin and crispy fries. Whatever, not a big deal. (At this point I feel the cost is not worth the food) Now today (March 22, 2014) my friend suggests we get BJ's. I wanted black bear, but my friend wanted drinks, so fine...We wait half an hour to have our pager start buzzing. That was once again, understandable and expected due to it being dinner rush. We are seated and we are given time to order. I order the Ahi Poke as an appetizer and decide to give the burgers another chance. Same order. Rare and thin crisp fries. I even told the waiter to make sure it is rare because they messed up the last time. He assured me it would be what I ordered. We waited about 20 minutes for our food. Shorter wait time I suppose. Got the burger, and it is ******* well done again. Not even slightly pink. It is browned in the center! I tell the server, and this time I have it sent back. It takes them another half an hour to get me another burger.  Now I am not saying I am more important than the other patrons of the restaurant, when a customer comes in saying his order was messed up before, and he orders the same thing, only to have the same mistake again. You would expect there would be better communication between the workers, and that the customers service may be just a little faster. If I wanted to wait around in stuffy building for half an hour to be seated, and another half hour to be disappointed, and then the next half hour to be starving, without food, brooding, watching other people eat, and just be out right PISSED, I can do that in the COMFORT OF MY OWN HOME! I can easily just NOT COOK DINNER, AND WATCH FOOD NETWORK, WHERE A REAL CHEF COOKS FOOD AND ENJOYS WHAT HES EATING. I told the server to simply just put the burger To-Go as soon as it finishes, give me my check immediately, I just want to pay, and leave.  This place is absolutely terrible. Never again. I'm telling my coworkers to never come back here again. My friends no longer have a say in where we are going if they suggest FREMONT BJ's. I have never been so upset with both SERVICE, and FOOD. BJ's you guys suck. Yeah maybe you didn't f*ck up my sandwich, but hell if I am paying you guys a cent for half a sandwich, let alone 9 dollars and tip. I'm going to Togo's or Subway.

Valerie L.,"San Francisco, CA",422,35,43,3.0,12/7/2012,"Had the 2 for $20 deal here. Comes with 2 soup or salads, medium pizza, and a pizookie. Medium pizza can be customized to order, which was a huge perk, because for about a few dollars less, my friend and I were going to get just a medium deep dish. Instead, we got salads and dessert to go along with it! Pizza was just alright...wasn't hot enough. I like my cheese to be stringy and messy to separate. However, the dough they use is always amazing and flavorful. I tried the Irish Pear beer on a whim, and didn't regret it. It's extremely light and not too fruity.

We waited about half an hour to be seated. The place was packed and noisy, but not too crazy.  Started off with a glass of Jeremiah Red. No need to say anything here, their beers are always on point and Jeremiah Red is my brew of choice. For appetizers, we ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and 2 Mini Chicken Tacos. Both were good, but the stuffed mushrooms stole the show. Definitely recommend those to start your dinner right. Then I didn't really want anything too big so I had the Grilled Chicken Pesto Flatbread Pizza. It was alright. For some reason I enjoyed the first two dishes more.

The first time we came we were frustrated that none of this was mentioned on their website. So, we just ordered a mini pepperoni and had it to-go. We brought a 5 year old with us so we didn't want to sit by the bar. The second time we came was a little better since we knew what to expect.

YES! a hair was cooked into my pizza. I was so grossed out lol. I tried my best to be nice about the situation because I hate rude people. I told our waitress that I felt bad but i was grossed out.

Mary K.,"Silver Spring, MD",72,92,2,3.0,7/27/2012,"I would have given them a better review if I was just basing the experience on days I would just sit in the bar over a couple of drinks, but on one occasion it was pretty much one disaster over the other.  RESERVATIONS---My immediate family is big, which is why we usually opt for call ahead seating. My sister called when they opened letting them know that we would be there. We all arrive 15 minutes prior to our reservation and they let us know that they had us on the list, but took us off because the girl who took it down did everything wrong. Told us we would have to wait an additional hour 15 minutes for seating (It was Father's day and the last game of the basketball series). Pretty :( , but went with it anyways. My sister decided to stay with the pager, while the rest of us headed out to Lion Super Market to shop around to kill time...Come on 1 hour 15 minutes ridiculous!!!! (According to the other reviews, this isn't a new issue) DROPPED PIZZA; Blagh STEAK:Since the game was over, things slowed down a bit. We were able to put in our order and ordered two of their steaks, a steak salad and an XL wheat crust pizza have buffalo chicken and cheeseburger. The order came, the steaks were over cooked, my mom's steak salad had only about 3 pieces of steak and a scant handful of mixed greens. The ended up giving us a small pizza and a medium pizza since they ran out of the XL wheat crust...except they dropped the medium pizza on the floor. They offered to replace it. My sisters and I ended up sharing the small pizza (4 of us). By the time the replacement pizza came in, we were already done with our meal.  REPLACEMENT PIZZA: So they end up making us a replacement pizza; that shit was burnt and they still expected us to eat it, The bottom was charred and honestly we didn't want to eat it and were already full with what we had. We told the waitress who notified the manager and he saw how burnt it was, he offered to replace it again. We could careless, so he offered to take it off our bill.  I understand that it was a busy day, but in general I was pretty much disappointed with the rushed service, missed orders, and the burnt pizza (come on, you drop our pizza and then replace it with a burnt one?!

faith r.,"Milpitas, CA",66,7,4,1.0,4/25/2014,"In a nut shell: service was horrible and our waitress made us feel like we were just a nusance and it obviously looked like she didn't want to be there. Also, shady plating of food, if it doesn't look right be sure to ask or you might get stuck paying full price for half an appetizer. What are you trying to do bjs, rip off your late night customers?? If you want to read full detail Its below. I will never be coming to this location again.  Went here on Tuesday night at 11pm, a bit late but there were still plenty of people seated in the dining area and the bar. We were seated very fast and our waitress came rather promptly. Though a friend of ours went to the bathroom so we decided to wait a bit till he got back. We didn't see our waitress come back for at least 15-20 min. Though we saw her walk around, stand at the hostess stand talking with other coworkers, make eye contact with us (as we were trying to suggest we are ready to order) and just continue to walk by again. When she finally came she sounded a bit annoyed under her breath but tried to act nice, I ordered the little bites mac n cheese and my two friends ordered burgers. She quickly then left to put the order in but my friends thought of an appetizer so I suggested the spinach dip. We call her back over, looking even more annoyed she takes down the dip order and leaves. When the dip comes its literally half or maybe even a quarter of the size it usually is, and there was not one single whole chip among the bunch, they were just crumbs and a huge lettuce leaf taking up half the plate. I ask if this is how it comes or if they changed it. The runner said our waitress may have put in the ""happy hour"" portion and she would send our waitress over. Iv been to bjs many times and have never heard of a happy hour portion, and if there was the waitress should have specified.  All of a sudden a new dip was brought out, I suppose its because the first one was obviously a mistake. I ask for more chips since the ones brought out were just crumbs the runner says to me ""crumbs? "" with a puzzled look on his face. Do you not see what was brought out!?  It should have never left the kitchen like this in the first place. After that we finally when we see our waitress and she half heartedly apologized and said "" it's come out twice like this, the cooks must hate me"". Way to look professional and deflect the blame. We find out later a group of 4 had the same thing happened to them cause we can see them complaining to the same waitress we had. My guess is they only just gave each of us half portions expecting us not to catch on and charge us full price. It even took her a good 10-15 min to even get our check. My guess was, she was complaining about us to the manager cause he kept looking over. I do love bjs and go quite often but I will never come to this location if that is how im going to be treated. I get its almost the end of your shift,  you must be tired and want to just go home, but at least act like you give a damn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=660

They really know how to make their customers feel special! Last night, my friend had a going-away party at this restaurant and he made the right choice, choosing this place. The staff treated all 16 of us really well. Our food came at a good time.  Since the night was really hectic my jalapeño burger ended up rare instead of the medium I ordered, as multiple jalapeño burgers were ordered at our table. The waiters empathized and went out of their way to give me a fresh burger and a free take home meal. It was delicious! They also helped us celebrate two birthdays at our table. Everyone went home happy and feeling like stars!

Steve H.,"Newark, CA",68,70,45,3.0,1/24/2012,"Most BJ's are pleasant. However, this one in particular lacks finesse. Put a little bit of effort in it please. You know that was coming, pause. Although there's a gang of people stopping by for a quickie during lunch, the wait is minimal since there's a lot of hands on the job ready to service you. My cousin and I shared the Avocado Eggrolls, Grilled Chicken Club with a cup of Clam Chowder, and a Pina Colada. Avocado Eggrolls - Crispy tubes stuffed deep with avocado. The sweet, sticky sauce on the side plays nicely with the eggrolls.   Grilled Chicken Club - Moist, succulent chicken breast topped with crispy bacon and smothered in a creamy garlic mayo. Arousing to the tastebuds. The shoestring fries that go with this dish were titillating. Clam Chowder - Slurping goodness but overly salty. Pina Colada - If you want to black out and not remember how you ended up in a stranger's bed then drink a few of these. Tasted nothing but liquor.  Don't expect a wild, mind blowing experience.

The food wasn't good and most things my fiancé asked they didn't have. I thought it was going to be really good to eat here but overall I didn't like the food. I ordered the pepperoni pizza and it had too much garlic! My fiancé ordered the clam chowder bowl and he said it tasted like it came out the can. We both didn't finish our meals. And to top it off we had asked for a birthday pazookie for his cousin in advance and didn't get it till and hour and half later. They said they hadn't made it yet. I think they just forgot cause when my sister told them again they said okay we will make it. They just gave it to him and that's it. I thought they had to put candle on it or something but no. So we didn't think much of it till 30 mins later we seen two employees give another customer a pazookie with a lit candle and they said ""enjoy!"" Not even us did they say anything. I was like are you kidding me! The worst service and also when I had said I didn't like the pizza the server rolled her eyes and mugged me. I was saying it nice so that they wouldn't think I was an annoying customer but it was the truth I did not like the pizza at all. I guess when you complain about the food they don't treat you right. Maybe I'll come back and try something different but this night was the worst! Didn't think it would be this bad. They took forever with our food and it was warm by the time it got to our table. Didn't know clam chowder took almost an hour to make if it was from a can. Idk about you but I hope they improve their service. I have never been treated his bad ever!

The food has still not arrived after servers just ""5 min"" to prepare comment. Server was not at all apologetic for the delay in food and missing the order.

My friends were already there & I came a bit late since I live in SJ & all & when I arrived, instead of asking politely what I would like to drink she was like ""What do you want?"", I was like ""WHAT?!"" cause I didn't think I heard her correctly & I was thinking to myself, ""oh uh uh, this girl is asking to get laid out or something"", but after she heard MY rude ""WHAT?!"", she ended up asking me in a forcefully nice kind of way of what I would like to drink. Nuh uh. Bish you effed with the wrong girl. Waitress or not; be a little bit more respectful please. If you give respect, you get respect! Anyways, other than that little dispute we ended up getting a different waiter because she was actually about to get off work when I got there (thank goodness), the waiter we got was pretty decent I guess.  Okay so food, I ordered the pasta with chicken & brocolli, it was decent. It wasn't as creamy as I hoped it would be. Both my friends got the deep dish pizza; they said it was delicious but the first pizza the manager came out & told us they accidently dropped the pizza when they were about to bring it out so they had to get another one done so we waited for like an extra 15 minutes for his (still charged us FULL price).  Overall, I don't think I would go back to this BJ's. As you can see why. I only gave it a 2 star because the service was very... Ahem, excuse me but SHITTY.

Lisa D.,"Newark, CA",0,31,2,1.0,7/14/2012,"When a friend suggests we go to BJ's Restaurant & Brewery it makes me CRINGE. BJ's tries to trick you into believing that they're better than other local sports bars, grungy lounges, or late night restaurants. This is absolutely ludicrous thinking & a complete scam. Save your time, save your money, & stay away! I've had better service at Applebee's! BJ's has provided the most consistently horrible service I have ever experienced at a ""restaurant"". When BJ's first opened it never really appealed to me, but I went with my friend & some of the cast after a show. We arrived around 11:30 pm & were ignored for more than 5 minutes. Once acknowledged, we were told to ""hold on"" so they could check to see if they had seating. Finally, we get lead to a table in the far left corner which would've been great had my friend not been in a wheelchair.  After flagging down someone to see if another table was available, we were rudely left maneuvering around chatting associates blocking the ramp & interrupting at least 3 other parties to clear enough space for her to get by. The only idea we received from BJ's staff was, ""Well, do you think she could get down the stairs?"". Although the décor may be nice, the setup is abhorrent. Even a fully able-bodied person struggles to maneuver in BJ's. The night proceeded the way I've now come to expect of BJ's- drinks forgotten or mixed up; food forgotten; dirty cups, plates, utensils, table; pathetic excuse of a waitress who takes orders & never comes back (another associate told us our waitress had left). When I went to order food at 12:30, I was shocked to be told the grill was off for the night already!  I ordered a turkey sandwich & it was THE WORST sandwich I had ever had. For $10 I would expect deli-like quality, but this sandwich made even Subway look delicious. My sandwich consisted of two slices of toasted wheat bread slathered in mayo, a huge chunk of tomato, & about a half of a pound of pre-packaged sliced turkey. I wish I had waited until I got home, I could've made a better sandwich there. A couple months ago, my boyfriend & I went to BJ's for drinks around 11:45 pm on a Friday. Luckily, we came together & he was there to walk me through the dark seedy parking lot. We sat at the bar area & were talking when the waitress came over. We asked for a few minutes only to be bombarded for an order 2 more times in less than 5 minutes, with our impatient waitress snidely stating that, ""the bar is going to close soon"". Umm, excuse me? Aren't you open for another hour?? We ordered a round of drinks around 12 & called a friend to join us. He arrived about 12:15 & we ordered 6 more drinks in total & an entrée. Halfway through, our waitress appears & states she hadn't expected more people to come in after 11:30, so she had made plans & was taking off; at least she left us with a replacement. At 12:50 a manager approached us & told that, ""it's time for you young folks to get out, we're closed"". I was so taken back by this distasteful & disrespectful treatment. We were paying customers in the establishment during business hours & not being loud or rowdy. If it was 1:05 perhaps, I could understand a gentle reminder that they need to clean up or something. Utter rudeness, from a manager no less, definite mood killer. Last night my boyfriend & I were looking for late night grubbing. We could've gotten elsewhere, but for some unknown reason I thought going to BJ's would be a good idea. It was 12:15 pm, so I called in to inquire what time they planned to turn off the grill. I SPOKE WITH ASSOCIATE CHRIS who put the phone down to CHECK WITH A MANAGER & told me as long as I am in the establishment & have me order in by 1, they will honor it. All I can say is BULL SHIT! My boyfriend arrived at 12:45 pm prepared to be seated & order for us both as I would be a few minutes behind him. THEY REFUSED TO SEAT HIM! I arrived shortly after 12:50 pm to find myself locked out with a smug looking manager leaning on the door. I was LIVID!!! Why say you're open until 1 am, but then do everything you can to deny customers?! If you close at 1 am, that implies that your associates leave at 1:15 at the earliest not at 1 like your patrons should be!  My boyfriend had placed a to-go order (minus the alcohol of course) & after calling him from the locked door & screaming at the manager through the glass, my boyfriend convinced him to let me in. I was sooo angry & making a bit of a scene, yet not once did any associate approach me to try to remedy the situation or understand my side. I had done my part & still got screwed by BJ's management again! I would never recommend BJ's to anyone! After everything, the food wasn't even that good. I could get the same caliber food at Red Robin at a lower cost, & maybe even TGI Fridays or Applebee's. I hope management reads this, because they ought to be ashamed of how they treat patrons in their establishment.

B -- S -- Plenty of parking, all the stores in this area have closed (RIP Circuit City) -- Right off the freeway and across from Newpark mall -- Restaurant size: about average/same as other locations -- 2nd newest, Concord is the newest location -- NEW glutten-free options :) at all locations Once you've been to BJ's, they're all about the same with the exception of service. That's where they make or break themselves at these chain restaurants. So I don't deduct anything from BJ's given that I actually have had a good experience at all of the locations in the bay area and even in Sacramento. Food was the same, I was glad to have a calzone and a ceasar salad. I also ordered a glutten-free pizookie which is totally awesome! Definitely a great alternative to the normal options.  *House Salad (side note): I've always noticed that the house salads are trash which I mentioned to the server. She told me that they make them the night before and that's why they aren't that good. The caesar and other salads, however, are made fresh to order! So if you wonder why the house salads suck like I did, now you know! My biggest gripe with servers is lack of attention and filling up my damn water. I know it's a hard thing to ask for. We had a big party but I'm a thirsty guy and no water means no bueno for me. Otherwise our server was fine. Some of my party complained about her being rude, but I didn't really notice.

(Which she didn't ) When I arrived to pay there were two cashiers , the person who called me forward to take me next wasn't able to take my payment . Instead I had to wait while money from another customer was exchanged directly in front of me . A customer who had arrived after me . Why call me forward and then tell me you can't take my money but you take the customer behind me ? Then when I was able to pay the girl was extremely rude when giving me my change and when I asked for a receipt she made a big show as if I was putting her out .

Ambiance here is socially-fun-loud, contemporary yet hip, sporty (large bar area & large flat screens throughout), family friendly, & hosting large parties friendly. Overall spacious making it very handicap, disabled, big-ppl, & senior citizen friendly too ^_^ WORDs OF CAUTION: Seriously, BEWARE OF THEIR SLIPPERY FLOORS! Not sure if it's possible to over-wax a floor or what, but for anyone wearing non-tennis shoes when visiting, walk easy w/ each step. What's crazy is that they (hostesses) KNOW their floors are a bit over-waxed & give warning as you get escorted to your table/booth. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've been here numerous times throughout a given day & throughout the week, & even tho I give caution to their floors, they definitely serve up great customer service here along w/ great food no matter when you visit. Keep up the awesome work team! EATS: Lord help me when I think I've sampled a lil' bit of everything here, when I visit again & survey their ""menu book"" I always find something new to try out. On this bday lunch w/ my sista, we enjoyed the below eats: $2.95 side Caesar Salad  $3.95 Mac & Cheese  $23.95 large Southwestern Pizza  I'll always recommend their Caesar Salad, just fresh & good! Sis enjoys their ""sophisticated"" mac & cheese w/ crumbled bacon on top; so creamy once u get 2-3 scoops in. Their pizza is listed as ""deep dish"", but it's just thick crust...not the definition as a Chicago Deep Dish Pizza in my eyes. Don't get me wrong tho 'cuz their pizza crust is good & I've yet to sample something I didn't like here. I think my sis & I might have found our fav BJ's pizza tho...their Southwestern Pizza is scrum-didly-umptous!

By the time my husband ate his soup it was cold. Mind you, we had to ask the person who brought our dinner (not our waiter) where our salad and soup were...Then the manager came over and apologized but did nothing with our bill other than to say sorry.

I know it's a chain and it follows the brewpub/sports bar model, but they could do so much more. First, hire someone who knows how to train young people to wait tables on a large floor. Keeping the hands full and focusing on the moment is everything. Running back to the kitchen because you forgot a key piece of the meal (the cheese ordered on the sandwich?) or an incorrect entree, that far away to the kitchen means the other entrees are cold when the waiter returns....not excusable. Must focus on the task at hand. The floor is too big. And how do these errors happen so consistently in the first place? We have tried and tried again (the clam chowder is pretty good, and we like the appetizers) but we're always sending something back to be replaced. They need to pull it together, work on quality control and maybe turn down the TVs one notch (not on big game nights, but random nights with football reruns and soccer and all the *different* channels are ALL loud?) and then it might be okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=720

Ami P.,"Fremont, CA",20,16,,2.0,8/9/2011,"This place falls right in line with what I expect from any big chain restaurant: Wah wah wah...destination disappointment. The only reason why I even ""ate"" here was because it was the chosen birthday spot for a friend.   1.  Let's begin with opening the menu and about the 3rd page in, I found that the pages were stuck.  I pried them apart and discovered wet, slimy, avocado goop acting as the adhesive. Yuck...I was immediately turned off.  Obviously, the menus don't get cleaned as frequently as I hoped.     2. The house side salad was around $5...for what?! A plate sprinkled with a sparse array of lettuce, shredded carrots, 2 cherry tomatoes, and crumbled, bottom- of- the- bag croutons. I'm not cheap, by any means, but I'm not stupid with my money either.  This salad was 100% a rip off.  A Fresh Express Salad kit from Safeway for $3 would have been a supermodel salad compared to this.   3.  The Margherita Flatbread was what I decided on for my meal.  I chose it b/c the picture and the description seduced me. I saw words like ""fresh"" and ""sweet"".  Deception!! ! What came out was something that looked as if a teenager would have heated up as an after school snack out of a frozen box.  There was NO fresh mozerella from what I could see/taste, and the sauce had a weird chemical flavor reminiscent of the janitorial supply closet back in high school.   4.  The white peach and mint tea was undrinkable.  The instant it touched my tongue, my tastebuds rejected it.  I was anticipating a slightly sweet, peachy flavor laced with mint...what I experienced was loud, sour, syrup flavored water.   The redeeming factor of this place was our waitress.  She was very friendly (although it was transparent that her speech was rehearsed and insincere) and she had a smile on her face the entire time.   I will only return to BJ's if I have to due to another celebratory gathering.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=720
Dorothy F.,"New York, NY",352,181,67,4.0,5/11/2009,"Training for a marathon is brutal. Not only do I have to run 5-6 times a week but every week I have to complete a long run that ultimately totals 22 miles to ready me for the actual 26.2 mile race.  I won't bore you with the agonizing details but I will say this for the sake of all the eye-rollers, naysayers, and people who ask me why I do it: SO I CAN PIG OUT GUILT-FREE. Makes sense now right?  My latest day of gluttony was this Saturday after a body numbing 22 mile run in San Francisco. How I managed to crawl into and out of my shower, put both legs into a pair of leggings, then walk the rest of the night after my run is nothing short of a miracle. Given our miraculous feat my running buddies and I decided it was time to treat our bodies to a different kind of punishment. The kind that involves eating enormous amounts of calories, sugar, fat, calories, sugar, and anything fried.  BJ's Brew house was just the place we were looking for. Now it's by no means a hole in the wall dive, but they serve up some very satisfying bar fare and comfort food in a surprisingly sleek and modern setting.  Our party of 6 started with a medley of appetizers ( in other words more than we shoud have):  -onion strings - thin slices of perfectly salted & battered onion  -chicken wings- the buffalo sauce was drizzled on top along w/ranch for a less messy but still tasty buffalo-style wing  -Santa Fe spring rolls- light but satisfying w/ a great blend of veggies and meat  -artichoke dip - creamy, savory and kinda greasy YUM  Since we loaded up on appetizers I decided to keep my entree 'light' by ordering a thin crust appetizer-size pizza. I'm partial to thin crusts and a huge fan of basil and this pie had both, along with tomato and sausage so I couldn't really find anything wrong with it. I also snuck a few bites of their parmesan-crusted chicken and mashed potatoes. Good flavor but very rich and filling ( probably why my BF had 1/3 of it leftover). Overall I was very pleased with their food. Their menu isn't breaking new ground but the food is hearty and satisfying.  After our many plates were cleared came the inevitable question: ""do you guys have room for dessert?"" Clearly our server had no idea. Without a moment's hesitation we chose 2 orders of their signature dessert. The PAZOOKIE.  And oh my pazookie that stuff was good. Despite the strange name it's a simple combo of cookie and ice-cream. But BJ's has clearly perfected this classic pairing. The cookie was warm, the batter chewy, and the chocolate chunks slightly melted and topped with a generous serving of vanilla ice-cream. The pazookie was clearly the highlight of the night but service was also good and our waiter was upbeat and attentive.  Now you clearly don't have to run a marathon to eat at BJ's but it's the only surefire way to enjoy their food and Pazookies, without any guilt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=720

As such, I was not surprised when I was told to arrive at 8 pm. We arrived at 8 and gave the name, mentioned we had call-ahead seating (there were two of us). The hostess handed us a pager and told us that'd be 30 minutes. I told her I did not expect a wait with call-ahead seating. She assured me that the call-ahead list was so long that the wait would still be 30 minutes. I told her that was unacceptable and asked to speak to a manager. As soon as the ""M"" word escaped my lips, the pager buzzed and we were ushered to our seats. Thankfully, we once again had wonderful service. Our server, Shane laughed and joked with us. At one point, my friend joked about getting brownie points for her birthday - and Shane ordered a birthday brownie as a surprise. He was on top of things and made the experience truly enjoyable. We spoke to the same manager, Brenda, who recognized us and thanked us again for the feedback. She told us how glad she was that we'd come back by, assured us that the front end waiting system is something they're still working on improving.

Linh N.,"Milpitas, CA",361,50,10,2.0,12/21/2011,"So my friends and I came here last night for a secret santa exchange and we normally go to restaurants in big groups. Last night was the longest wait I ever had at any restaurant: approx 2 and a half hours. We were talking about going to another restaurant but since they gave us our estimated wait time as one and a half hour we decided to wait it out. In hindsight, we would've gone to another restaurant if we knew we were going to wait that long.  There was a lot of confusion as to where they were going to seat us. After waiting for that long, they were still about to seat our group separately. We finally all got a table together in the end after all the confusion though.  Be warned, DO NOT WEAR HIGH HEELS THERE UNLESS YOU LIKE FALLING. The floors there are incredibly slippery and dangerous to women with stilettos. I needed my friend to walk me around just to risk not injuring myself.  After the long wait, my friends and I finally received our food but after digging in we decided that the wait was not nearly worth it. I got the angel hair toscana and it was just an okay dish, the noodles were bland. My friend ordered the tilapia and she wasn't really satisfied with her dish either. The only thing that anyone really liked that evening were the pazookis.  Even the pazookis were hard to order because the waitresses and waiters barely paid attention to us and never cared to check up on us; it was nearly impossible to to get their attention. There also seems to be a lack of communication between the waiters since we got two pazookis when we only ordered one; we took the extra one anyways though.

Uyen V.,"Hayward, CA",106,11,197,1.0,11/6/2011,"This is not the first time I've ever eaten at BJ's. I've actually been here tons of times. But tonight pissed me off enough to actually write a review. Let's start off with the little bit of good the night had to offer. The food is always decent. They forget a couple of things here and there, that's fine, its a busy place. Our waitress/waiter always brings it out later. Usually super friendly staff. We wanted a booth, but they gave us a table so asked if we could wait for the booth and they obliged. We waited FOREVER. The girl at the front desk was too busy texting and looking at her nails to really pay attention. She offered us two separate booths at the bar. Wtf? We are ONE party. Why would we sit at a loud ass bar, at two separate booths.  Luckily her coworker sees a booth open up and points it out and directs us to it. That girl deserves 5 stars, but our waitress fucked that up. So on to the best part of the night. Our waitress Jessica. If I could take a picture of her to warn all other patrons I would. Let's be frank, the girl shouldn't work in this industry if she hates her job so much. We sat down, she came over and asked what drinks we would like to start off with, I asked if I could order the appetizers, she ignores me and asks my friend at the end of the table what he'd like to drink. When she gets to me, she asks me, ""The great beginnings right?"" with so much attitude that I almost  said no and got up and left. After that, she brings us out our food. I had a midori sour and my friend took a sip. I can understand you have to card everyone, but you can talk to people like they're actual people. My friend didn't have ID on her so Jessica very rudely said ""DON'T SIP THAT ANYMORE.""  Um okay. Understandable. You're doing your job. But how about you don't need to be so fucking rude. Now for the topping on the sundae. As we were finishing up our meal, she put the check on the table and KEPT checking on it. Uh, if it looks like we're not done, maybe, we aren't fucking done.  So we pay cash, bill is about $117, we pay about $121, fitting tip for shitty service in my opinion. I usually tip 10-15% so this was a low one for me, but I was pissed. As we were leaving, she yells at us ""Thanks for the 4$ tip, I worked my butt off"" Uh, what, the, fuck? I gotta give it to her for making sure she was a bitch the whole night through. Consistency is key right? Tried to leave a complaint,  but we were told that the general manager wouldn't be back til Wednesday. I hope he/she likes getting bitched out early in the morning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=680

Your hair should be up in a pony tail or in a bun not down ! I understand your trying to attract customers but you can do it with your hair up ! And customers won't have hair in there food !

Steve C.,"Fremont, CA",105,116,24,5.0,1/4/2013,"Ok, I have to give credit where credit is due! BJ's Brewery & Restaurant at their Newark/Fremont location has improved significantly. I don't know if they started listening to their Yelp reviews but I was pleasantly surprised and amazed at the quality of food and service. Their onsite management should be proud of taking a lackluster chain and turning it into something they should be proud of. We were invited to go for New Years Day and I had the Bacon Cheeseburger and it was darn good. Now it wasn't has great as Val's Burgers in Hayward, but the combination of the Burger, Steak Fries, Full Bar and the exceptional service has given it a 5 star rating in my book. My entire table was raving about the meals and the service and all of us said ""We would be back"". I typically say, eat local, and I would recommend you go back and try BJ's again if you didn't have a good experience the first time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=680

I've been to many bjs. Northern and southern California and this has got to be the worst out of all of them. The waiter never came after we asked for a refill of water. My pizza was burnt and not pre cut it was a mission to even get a slice of pizza. I'm over this place. I would rather go to the blossom hill one and wait a lot longer than have to have service like this. Ridiculous. You pay for service this is definitely not the place to get that. I'll take my money elsewhere where they can refill my water after I ask for it and not half hour later.

Edward L.,"Milpitas, CA",143,18,393,3.0,7/18/2010,"Typical BJ's establishment. Great for parties, but be prepared to WAIT in long lines during dinner times. Reason for this is that there are very few BJ's up in NorCal.  On a saturday 6pm, took about 45 minutes. If you like alcohol, you can always wait at the bar. Don't forget it's a family restaurant, so only 3 shots an hour so you don't puke on a kid. Friendly SERVICE and decent food. Usually get the pizzas here, but honestly their pizza is similar to Pizza Hut. Deep dish pan pizza with lots of oil to make it crispy, which is my favorite type of pizza. Unfortunately it's also x2 the price of The Hut. You should come to BJs if you want to pay for the atmosphere and watch sports on the big screen. Food is typical of normal American family restaurants. Fun TRIVIA, this place is located in a plaza which consists of only a Mervyn's and a BJs. Lots of construction panels just plastered with EAT AT BJs. All the old stores here have closed.

Lucy D.,"Milpitas, CA",486,786,1873,4.0,12/30/2011,BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse combines new American cuisines with several other different cultures. They are known for there beers and there appetizers are simple delicious. If its your birthday they give you a free piziooke. Pros Atmosphere: The area itself is large and open so you don't feel at all cramped inside a restaurant. The perimeter of the restaurant is surrounded by flat screen tv's showing sport shows to give it a sports bar feel. The added decorations and coloration of the restaurant adds a nice touch as well.  Food: The food tasted pretty good with a large variety to choose from. They also have a large selection of alcoholic drinks as well to go nicely with an appetizer.  Birthdays: They give you a free pazooki on your birthday so come by if you want something free for your birthday.  Parking: The parking for this place is huge so parking is simple.  Location: its located near other shopping strips and food area so a prime place to go grab food and do a little shopping as well.  Cons Crowded: It gets pretty crowded here during prime time around 7:00 PM. Wait time is usually 30 to 45 minutes during peak hours.  Price: The pricing of the food seems a little off. The quality of the food compared to the price your paying for it doesn't seem to add up. The food is good but not necessarily worth the price. Overall this BJ's on Mowry is a nice place to dine out. The large parking with good food quality is great. Come before the peak hours to avoid the crowd and you'll find it a pretty good spot to dine out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=680

Curtis C.,"San Jose, CA",166,28,22,4.0,9/14/2010,"With Mervyn's having shuttered their doors long ago, BJ's sits alone across from the Newpark Mall, a dessert oasis (more on that to come) in a literally deserted strip mall. Location aside, the parking lot is always full and the restaurant bustling, leaving  BJ's Brewhouse and my post happy hour waistline as two things that are definitely not suffering from recession. Speaking of dollars and scents, the smell of deep dish pizza and sinfully delicious pizookie wafting through the air as you step through the door will get your taste buds firing on all cylinders without doing too much damage to your pocketbook.  The key to a successful BJ's run is to go during happy hour, or to catch their weekday lunchtime specials, that way you have free reign on all their best menu items at cut-rate prices. Some of my favs on the menu include the sliders (pulled pork or angus beef, both are delicious) with fries, most of the pizzas, spinach artichoke dip w/ tortilla chips, and the egg rolls.  Of course no visit to BJ's is complete without ordering a pizookie. A word of warning to anyone who finds themselves sharing one of these bad boys with me, try to take any of the crispy cookie edge and I will parry carte the hell out of your spoon. I didn't take 4 weeks of fencing class at the Brea Community Center for nothing. Well actually I took it because it seemed random, and I'm random, but that's neither here nor there. Aside from the food, BJ's also serves their own line of decent brews. I've been known to imbibe my fair share of the Jeremiah Red and Piranha Pale Ale during many a happy hour. The combination of tasty bar food, good beer, and a gigantic wall of TVs playing every sporting event imaginable, makes BJ's a pretty righteous spot to catch a ball game. Hits: Happy hour specials, lunch specials, ginormous TV wall Misses: Crowds, somewhat limited bar seating at this location Words of wisdom: Arrive early if you want to snag a table in the bar, lunch specials are weekdays only, check out the late night happy hour if you missed the early one",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=800

This restaurant  is usually packed but you can call ahead to be put on the wait list. And if you drop in on a busy day/night, general wait time averages from 30-40 min wait or longer. On several occasions, I had to wait 30-40 minutes for a table but it was so worth it! Some of the dishes I had tried and would recommend is the Cajun Pasta, Chicken Alfredo, Baked Potato, Pizza, Turkey Club Sandwich and the desserts of course! So tasty and delicious! The portions for these meals are much larger. As for the price for the meals, you can get tasty meals between $8 - $15, very affordable considering the large portions! Customer service may be a bit slow because this restaurant is so popular and packed but the server is generally kind and try to do their best to accommodate you!

Richard G.,"Los Altos Hills, CA",176,451,472,4.0,6/27/2009,"One of my clients suggested a late dinner and wanted to try out the new BJ's in Newark. Maybe because it was a Tuesday, we did not encounter any of the wait times that my fellow yelpers encountered. I think they may be a victim of their popularity in the local area. The place was very full for a Tuesday night. We were seated right a way and our drinks arrived promptly with our salad and soup. I found my salad to be very fresh and crispy and just the right amount of dressing. Our server announced that she was taking a short break and announced who would be covering for her. I was very impressed as I do not recall anyone doing this before. Her replacement server made sure we got our entrees of roasted chicken and I ordered the Salmon which was cooked to perfection and served with wonderful vegetables and rice, a good selection. They really did a wonderful job of keeping our glasses full and we were too stuffed to order any dessert.  So there you have it, great service, upscale ambiance, and fantastic food. Too bad I was driving as I would like to have sampled their home made brews. The home brewed Root Beer was a wonderful addition to my meal and my client really enjoyed the Strawberry Lemonade.

jack l.,"San Mateo, CA",24,74,78,5.0,3/1/2013,"The mark of a great restaurant is not just putting food out fast, but puting out top quality food and making your customers happy in the process. This is precisely what the staff here has done for me and my family. Don't get me wrong here.  The place is not perfect because the kitchen had issues but they more than made up with it great food and service.     We came to Bj's on a busy Friday night and got seated within 20 minutes. We were greeted by our server Ravinder (forgive the spelling if it is wrong) who was cordial and friendly. She took our order and brought our drinks with a smile. We happily went about drinking our drinks and talking away. About the time we noticed that our food was not coming our server and kitchen manager Phillip arived and told us that they had run out of sauce and had to re-fire our food. To make up for the error they comped us appetizers and coffee while we waited for our new dishes to be prepared. We were more than happy to accept and in no time our dishes arived and we were both happy and well fed. Evidence of the care taken to prepare the food was evident in the food that was delivered. Attention to detali was taken in the plating and the shrimp scampi was cooked perfectly.

Maya M.,"Fremont, CA",50,21,6,1.0,12/8/2014,"Made reservations and Came here with a group of about 8 for my friend's birthday dinner. WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED IN A RESTAURANT. A friend of mine wasn't very hungry so she got two appetizers, her calamari came out completely cold so they sent it back. They also got avocado egg rolls so while they were waiting for their calamari they were about to take a bite and a nice big hair was sticking out of it. Those got sent back as well. On top of that when the calamari came out we realized they re-fried the SAME calamari. So it was literally like hard rubber. We just said forget it and we don't even want it anymore just take it off the tab. On top of all THAT, we had all had our entrees out and my boyfriend was still waiting for his. At first it wasn't a big deal but after we asked over 3 times they brought the manager Rich or Rick out whatever his name was and he showed the slightest sincerity or care at all. He was not at all apologetic or seemed to care. So they're probably just used to giving terrible service. He just kept telling us ""it'll be right out"" ""it should be out soon"" (it was just a small lunch entree by the way, just a piece of fried chicken on some mashed potatoes) you would think it was the most extravagant thing on the menu. By this time almost all of us were getting out plates taken away because we were all finished and then they finally brought out his damn dinner. We came to have a Birthday dinner together with our friend and he didn't even get to eat at the same time as us. And on top of THAT we told the waiter it was our friend's birthday and he started taking care of our checks already. When we got our checks we told him again and he brought out a mini pizzookie for him.

J C.,"Richmond, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/18/2012,"I came here for my cousin's birthday at the beginning of October. Note that I only stayed because it was his birthday and I wasn't going to ruin it because of someone's terrible ethics or lack of manners. When I walked in to reserve a table, the server barely acknowledged me. No thank you, no welcome to BJ's. Nothing. I let that go. If she was having a bad day and couldn't suck it up, whatever. Later on while we were outside waiting, my cousin (being the optimistic, silly guy that he is) says something along the lines of ""oh she must think I'm cute"" jokingly. I look over and it's that same girl with the attitude working the take out counter staring at us. A few minutes later one of her coworkers comes over and she says something to him and they both stare, no smile. It honestly felt like a high school exchange. I called after my 24 hour shift two days after the incident. Asked to speak to a manager regarding what happened, because it was definitely uncalled for. No one called back. Thanks for that BJ's management. Really professional. The kicker? I would've just let this go because it's not worth it, but I find it really odd that I woke up with an upset stomach and experienced the symptoms of food poisoning during my 24 hour shift. I think it's pretty ridiculous for anyone to have this behavior, especially when the customer has done NOTHING wrong and nothing to you. There are plenty of other people who can suck up whatever they're going through and work and actually be thankful for a job and show it. I've been spit at/on, assaulted, had every obscenity yelled at me, whatever you can think of on the job, and you know what? I still suck it up and do my job because that's what I was hired to do. Not act like an immature brat for no reason at all.  I know I'm just one customer and I wont affect your business, but I'll never be back to this location.

The happy hour appetizers are decently priced as well, though the alcohol prices really aren't marked down much but given the Newark/Fremont area, there aren't that many options for late night drinking anyway so I'm going to let that slide.   The food is usually pretty decent, although I have been there on some occasions when the food could have used more attention by the chef. There seems to be an inconsistent dinner rush that isn't wholly dependent on the day of the week at all. Just keep in mind if you're going with a large party, to arrive earlier if possible cause you'll probably be waiting.  $4 mini pizzas during happy hours are delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=800
Carina R.,"Newark, CA",0,535,,3.0,5/24/2013,"BJ's is me and the hubster's go-to place when we can't think of anywhere interesting to go to eat. It's usually pretty lively, there's beer, and decent food. That's really all we want in a place to chill at on a Friday after a long week at work. The wait is usually at least 30 minutes (sometimes an hour), but it's not that bad because we usually go to the bar and have a few beers before we get seated. Sometimes we'll get lucky and we're able to sit at the bar or at the bar tables for a while before, too. Sometimes not - the bar can be really crowded. The beers BJ's has on tap are pretty good. And if you don't like their beers they always have outside beers on tap and beers in the bottle. Their mixed drinks are pretty good, too. There's something for everyone when it comes to drinks. Their food is hit or miss. The apps are pretty good. Salads are too. I usually get the pizza and that's always delicious. But some of their entrees are either really good or just so-so. I would stick to the burgers and sandwiches. Everything else, to me, has always been not that good. Every time I get something other than the pizza or a salad - like a baked potato, chicken, fish, etc. I have been let down. I usually regret ordering that and think I should have gotten the pizza like I usually do. Their service is so-so as well. Its hit or miss. You either get someone who is super on it or someone who ignores you for most of the time. BJ's is alright. Not the best, but pretty darn good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=800

Apples and oranges obviously. Moving on... The service was much better. Our waiter was much more friendly and attentive even though it was much more busy than before. The food was definitely worth it this time around. I just know now to only order pizza. The only issue is that I ordered a giant pizookie for my friends and myself to share.

Our waiter gave us ample time to decide what to order and the food came out pretty quickly. Since it's a brewery, I always like to order a beer with my meal. Usually I get the Jeremiah Red (nice and low on the hops flavor), but this time I tried their seasonal beer the Nitwit (like Blue Moon but packed with more flavor). I definitely want to come back and get it again. For food, my friend and I split the Ahi Poke, and I got the lunch size of the Italian Market salad. I loved the Ahi Poke, and it's a must order if you like avocado and sashimi-style tuna. Usually the salads are around $11, but for lunch they're only $8 (and still just as huge and filling!). This time, I think the salad was a little heavy on the dressing, but if you like a little bit of everything the Italian Market salad is delicious.

I have worked as a server for 8.5 years of my life and I've lived between the states of Louisiana and California and I have never in my life had worst service than I did tonight. I was ONE of my servers TWO tables and Ravinder K, our server, did not refill our drinks one single time. In fact, we asked the manager after 45 minutes if our salads were coming out before he brought them out, as well as refilling out waters after they sat empty for 20+ minutes. My mixed drink tasted like cough syrup, not that our server asked at all to see how our drinks or entree's were. Also, 2 of our guests ordered broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl, only to wait 50 minutes to get Clam chowder in a bread bowl. When they let the manager know they ordered broccoli cheddar he said he'd have it fixed in a moment only to come out 5-10 minutes later to inform them that the cooks made a mistake and they had no more bread bowls but they he could bring them a small bowl of soup and remove the two soups from the bill. So we sat there for over 2 hours, got most of our entrees messed up, as well as no refills, and the soups also never came. The manager didn't apologize, neither did the server who looked stunned when I informed her that this was by far the worst service I'd ever received.

I've been to this location several times before and I am generally happy about everything. This last time I went, was with 4 friends. 2 of my friends ordered beer and really enjoyed it (they have a crazy beer menu). My other friend got some kind of cider that was really tasty too. I'm definitely ordering that next time. We didn't get appetizers but for my entree I ordered the jambalaya. Instead of eating it with rice I subbed it for pasta, which tasted great. I wish they gave me more sauce, but that's probably why you're supposed to eat it with rice haha. My friends ordered a pizza, side of potato skins, and a sandwich. Everyone loved their food.  For dessert, we had a sampler style pizookie.You get 3 mini pizookies with your choice of flavors. We ordered 2 oreo and 1 macadamia. I LOVED THE OREO ONE. OH MY GOODNESS. They put a little creme on the side too in addition to the ice cream that made it more oreo-like. The chocolate cookie was surprisingly not too chocolate-y which I was ecstatic about.

Linda C.,"San Leandro, CA",144,441,1,1.0,1/3/2010,"Just call me Shaniqua C. I think I should have insisted on not settling on this place for even a casual holiday dinner. Something told me that I would regret eating here or something would piss me off majorly about this place...and boy should I listen to my intuition... THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE.  Now, most of you will ask: so what? Granted, there are many places with good food and bad service that I will tolerate because the food is just that damn good...here...not so much.  The wait was long, but we dealt with it because it was during the holiday season, but come to think of it, every time i try to patronize this place, the wait is always one hour MINIMUM. Sorry, I won't even wait that long for some places with MUCH better food... Walking us to the table, our hostess did not even NOTICE that in the process of carrying a PILE of presents, that I had slipped on a GREASE SPOT that hadn't been mopped up properly. EVEN WORSE, she proceeded to smile weakly at me and say ""Oh, our floors are always like that!"" THEN...WALKS AWAY. !??!!?!??!?! OH HELL NAW. NO YOU DI'NT! The ghetto queen inside me gets unleashed and I ask our waitress (who, by the way, was totally NICE) to get the manager. He comes, and I unleash the fury that is SHANIQUA C. (aka Linda C) and apparently I give him enough shit for him to go back to the hostess table and dish out some hell himself.  And yeah, he should. What if I was pregnant?! What if I had existing health problems that were compounded by that fall? I mean really, people have sued for a LOT less, and these chain restaurants are the first choice for lawsuits, so don't you think they would have CARED a little bit more?  The manager took my name and number but he has not called as he said he would. Minus 10 million points.  Sadly, the food wasn't bad, but the service is SHITTY, SHITTY, SHITTY - and enough to make me never wanna come here again.  To be FAIR, the food was decent and I ended up still have a good time with friends despite the nasty and MASSIVE 3 inch x 3 inch bruise I ended up with for 2 weeks.  All in all, there is NO EXCUSE for a chain restaurant of this size to have service this shitty, and for this reason, I will never ever come to this BJ's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=860

It was happy hour, so i decided to order some hot wings and a Lagunitas IPA. The wings were magnificent, juicy and slightly crispy . The sauce came on the side, so you are able to control how much heat you really want.  The beer was of course ever so delicious. I also ordered the Mini Bruschetta, it was very cheap and really tasty, the pieces of bread were thick, and it tasted similar to their pizza dough. Overall i was very happy with my visit to BJ's, the food was excellent and the service was right there with it, even the other people at the bar were very friendly.

Nikki C.,"East Bay, CA",1789,409,785,3.0,1/14/2011,"I've been to several BJ's restaurants and this location quite a few times.  The food is decent, service is okay, and happy hour specials aren't the best. HAPPY HOUR 4pm to 7pm 10pm to close Raspberry Lemon Drop = 3 stars * tastes pretty good but I prefer a traditional lemon drop. Brewhouse Blonde = 4 stars * my favorite BJ's beer next to the Nutty Brunette.   Angel Hair Toscana = 3.5 stars * reasonably priced, large portion, & very similar to TGIF's Bruschetta Chicken Pasta.  However, at BJ's you can order it plain, with Chicken or with Shrimp. Spinach & Artichoke Dip = 3 stars * your average dip served w/tortilla chips Crispy Calamari = 3 stars * a bit too greasy for my taste but pretty good nonetheless. Margherita Fresca Flatbread Pizza = 4 stars * considered an appetizer but can easily be ordered as an entree. This is my favorite happy hour special. Pizookie = 5 stars * one of the only reasons I crave BJ's over other chain restaurants is their infamous Pizookie dessert.  I typically order Chocolate Chunk and this never lets me down.  Most recently I tried their Cookies 'N Cream Pizookie and it's equally gratifying. 3 stars is a fair rating.  I don't normally dine here for lunch or dinner, mainly because their food is pretty average w/the exception of the Pizookie.  9 times out of 10 we're here for happy hour or for someone's birthday.  The bar area gets very crowded and hard to find a seat if you're with a large party.  You'll get the most out of their Happy Hour by ordering the food specials.  For drinks, you only get $1 OFF cocktails and beer so if you're looking to get buzzed at a lower cost then TGIF is a better alternative for Happy Hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=760

I had there Nutty Brewnette (American Brown Ale) and it was just ok. Not a particularly memorable beer. I ended up switching to Boddingtons.  The food was again mass produced. I had a Cuban sandwich burger. It was easy to tell the burger portion had been cooked long ago was was simply kept warm. How hard is it to make a burger tough? I swear I had to chew that burger forever. It wasn't all that good. The dinner salads were pretty plain and boring. The salad missed the nice crisp crunch you'd expect from a salad.  Will I be back?

Cat G.,"San Ramon, CA",252,214,35,1.0,3/1/2011,"Saturday, February 26th, 2011.  We were in town for a big NCS wrestling meet. We had a break in the afternoon and decided to take all the kids to BJ's for lunch before finals. We arrive with a group of 18-20 people. Right away the Manager on duty said that she has a big party that will be done in about 20 minutes and we'll be seated no longer than 35 minutes. If it was going to be any longer than that we'd have to go somewhere else in order to get back in time. So we stayed given that time window.  45 minutes later...  Still waiting, 18 people deep in the waiting area... when I asked the manager how much longer it would be, she said they were bussing our tables and we would be seated in just another 10 minutes.  15 minutes later...  ""I'm so sorry, they are just putting your tables back together, we'll be seating you in 5 minutes. Why don't I start putting in your orders now so that when you sit down the food will be ready"" Which we agreed to do..  20 minutes later...  They take us to the table. By that time. two of our pizzas were cold, one of the sandwiches had soggy bread. 8 of the kids had to go back to the school, scarfing down food, because a 35 minute wait turned into an hour and 20 minutes.

Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of BJ's in San Diego and Reno, but had not given this Brewhouse a try until the other night. Walked in and was almost awed, it was definitely a hot spot with large screen TVs, a noisy bar and plenty of people waiting to be seated. Curiously, there were open tables when I browsed the floor, and now I know why. Reservations? Sure, 10 people or more and 80% of your party must be present before being seated. I get that. But no reservation and you are still required to have 80% of your party there before seating. Wait a minute? If you have kids, this is a real stressor. Especially if you know that people will be trickling in after work and not necessarily show up all at once. Shame on me? If only I had known. While waiting we look over the extensive menu, a definite plus as far as selection goes. Even gluten free options for the growing number of people with allergies. Had to try the gluten free beer and was not disappointed. Not hoppy so if you are an IPA fan, this is not your beer, but for those that like the smoother sweeter beers, this one is tasty enough to get you through the night. Spent enough time reading the multi-page menu and still not at the 80% mark. Fine, kids are restless, but don't hassle us about not having everyone there. It's your policy and when you say, ""Hey, let's all meet up at BJ's!"" it's not like you will get everyone there at the same time. Making the story short, the manager stepped in and seated us with only 70% present. Food is tasty enough and the selection of brew is impressive; Arrogant Bastard Ale anyone? Kids are now happier with fries, mac-n-chess [which is bigger than the gourmet adult version], chicken fingers and burgers; the adults are now happier with some drinks in their systems. One thing to ponder: Potatoes bigger than a four year old's head! Not natural. But unfortunately, we had to ask for our server for things more than a few times. For the price and the included gratuity, we expected a bit more, but someone mentioned that is just the sign of the times. Seriously? Since when did good customer service change its definition based on generational values? The food was good, beer is better than most, atmosphere is lively, pricing is on the higher side . . . but sadly the deal breaker is the customer service and the way they treated us from the beginning.

The first time I came here with a small group of friends for drinks.  We ended up ordering the best beginning appetizer sampler.  The four dishes that made up this sampler all sounded delicious.  It came with avocado egg rolls, sante fe spring rolls, spinach dip, mozzarella sticks, and a small selection of dipping sauces.  I've had better avocado egg rolls at other BJ's locations, so it's safe to say I was very disappointed.  And as far as the sante fe spring rolls go, I'm speechless.  They looked like they were old and had been sitting out some where for far to long.  The mozzarella sticks and spinach dip were nothing special either.  The drink I got was the jerry burst, which I enjoyed.  It was a berry cider mixed with some type of beer. The second time I went with a larger group of people.  It was very difficult to decide what to get to eat so I ended up getting the mozzarella tomato salad while i made my final decision.  The tomatoes had absolutely NO flavor and the balsamic dressing that came with it was completely hard on the plate.  It looked very pretty, but the overall taste was pretty disgusting.  Even if the balsamic dressing wasn't cemented into the plate it still had an off flavor.  I ended up getting the ahi tuna appetizer for dinner because it looked and sounded amazing.  To bad it wasn't.  I think they might have forgotten to add the sauce that came with it because it was straight flavorless chunks of tuna. I normally love coming to BJ's, but I think I may have to take a brief break before returning soon.  The service though both times was amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=760

(Thanks Chris for the great service!) Let's start with what happened last night...I'm not a beer drinker but my friend kept raving about a few of the beers they had, like this Pumpkin Ale whatever it's called?  So, I figured what the hell...April 16, 2009 will mark the first day in the 31-years of my life that beer would touch my lips.  We both ordered two ""Taster Sets,"" which were four - 5oz glasses (See the pic I uploaded). I picked the one that was preset and she picked a custom set.  This was a GREAT way to test if I liked the light - darker stuff.  Based on the different beers I tried, I can say that I liked...actually, enjoyed if anything the Pale Blonde.  Not too sure if it'll make me a beer drinker but, if I ever had to order one, that's what I'd go for. They have a pretty wide selection of menu choices, probably a little too much that you might have a hard time deciding what to order.  Their menu is kinda reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory's menu, without the advertisement on every other page!   We ordered their sampler appetizer (It has a real name, I just forgot the name of it!) but it came with Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Santa Fe Spring Rolls and Avocado Egg Rolls.  I think it was about $13.95, not too bad.  We both got a salad, I absolutely LOVE their Wedge Salad...it has to be the dressing I think!  Overall it was a great night. The other couple times I've been here were for lunch.  They have some pretty decent lunch specials like a half sandwich with fries and half salad for about $7-$8.  I got the California Chicken Club and of course, the Wedge Salad...major yum!  They also had a personal pizza and salad for also about the same price, as well as a bunch of other specials. It can get pretty busy there around lunch time so, if you're on a 30 or even a 60, plan on a 90!  Gotta leave room for some workplace gossip while they prep the food!  haha!   But that's where they loose 1-star, not many people have the luxury of an extended lunch hour and they don't seem to realize the sense or urgency of getting out of there at a decent time.  The first time we were there, the manager noticed me constantly checking to see what time it was and eventually comped our meal.  Don't get any ideas, this was like the 2nd day they were open....and they did improve the 2nd time around! ;) Overall, BJ's is a great place for lunch, dinner, happy hour, watching a game, etc.   My only beef is that the plaza where it's located at sucks!  The only two entrances to reach the restaurant are like ridden with major, major potholes.  :/  But, that's not their fault...we'll blame it on Mervyn's for going out of business!  haha!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=740
Will M.,"Santa Ana, CA",554,646,2470,4.0,6/9/2009,"This is their newest restaurant in the area.  I am generally not a fan of chains, but I love BJ's concept of good microbrew and tasty food.  I've been eating at my local BJs for about 5 years since they opened, so it was an easy choice to check out this Fremont Newark restaurant.  First off, the restaurant is as crowded as a free Molly Cyrus concert during weekends.  We drove by on Fri. Night at 6 PM and there were lines of people outside.  We returned for lunch at 1:30 PM on Saturday and it was immediate seating.  I had their Baslamic Chicken, ($12) very flavorful and moist chicken with small side of greens and dressing and  seasoned rice in lieu of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a little sweet with a slight tang, and that glaze onion was yummy.  I opted for the cooly named Nitwit White Belgian beer ($6) which is Hefeweizen with tiny bit of coriander and citrus.  It was a perfect match.  My nephew had their Mediterranean Pizza which he eats with topped with ranch dressing. My brother had the chicken lettuce wraps, always a winner esp. at BJ's.   Generally, most of the food their I've tried is quite good and there is enough of it.  Their pizzas are excellent with a puffy flavorful crust. Their pastas are good, as are sandwhiches. My favorite item, though, it their version of the Chinese Asian sesame salad. They use napa cabbage instead of lettuce, so the flavor and texture are better than lettuce based salads in my opinion.  Lastly, I love their award winning bears, all of them.  And they are good about telling you what goes with a certain food in case you don't know.   Service was friendly and quick this time.  I know this place is nuts during prime time on weekends.  This new restaurant is clean and very well put togehter, though loud.  Fortunately, they built it right next to a recently abandoned Mervyn's.  So although this is a high high traffic area, at least parking isn't a problem right now.  Of course, if they put something else like another shop in the ex Mervyns, it could be bad parking wise. They keep advertizing their pizzookie.  I've had it, it's yummy.  But it's a pschological ploy.  They know you'll love their food, and for most restaurants, desserts are a huge money maker.  So is coffee and beverages.  So if you haven't had enough food, maybe you'll go for their yummy dessert, and that is a good choice.  There are other desserts here, too. But being a bigger fan of the Flipino dessert called halo halo, an ice and canned milk and ice cream concoction of preserved and canned fruits and beans, I never quite get to their desserts. We headed elsewhere for that, but they have good food period here. The bill was $46 plus tip.  Not bad for a very nice time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=740
Thamina S.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",0,13,,1.0,7/8/2015,"I'm actually sad with this location. It takes forever to recieve our food, they need to have more waiters on the clock or else they will run out of business soon. We ordered potato skins as our app and we specificed no meat on it because of religious reasons and when it got to our table, lo and behold there was meat. It took them awhile but when they finally gave us our app our entree had arrived. My sister ordered a cajun pasta and believe me there was nothing cajun about it, it tasted just like bland spaghetti with ragu sauce. I ordered a small pizza and it was barely even warm. I would say our wait for our food was 30-40 minutes, which is unacceptable. I can't come here anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=740

Like when you would travel 25+ miles and wait 30min + for a table to enjoy some good food and ultimately eat their famous pazookie. Well those days are over!  BJ's...what happened? I would use to crave their entrees and appetizers but now i am dreaded every time I am forced to go to BJ's. The last time i went with a group of friends for drinks, i tried their snakebite thinking that it would be just as good as Yardhouse's. O boy was I wrong. It was pretty bad beer on top of pretty bad pear cider that had a medicine aftertaste to it. I love beer, but i couldn't even force myself to drink that. For snacks, I shared the Best Beginning appetizer which comprised of spinach dip, avocado rolls, santa fe rolls, and mozzarella sticks. One word: mediocre.  O yea and the red velvet pazookie? W T F. Does not taste like red velvet at all. LIARS!  This BJ's especially, I think I've only had bad experiences of BJ's at this particular location. But think about it...why do we go to chain restaurants? It is because we hope and think that being a chain, every restaurant should have the same standard. That's what makes chain restaurants so successful. So i have no pity at all, if you are confident enough to open up chain restaurants you better have all of them at the right standards!  But besides that, good service is no good if the food sucks. Our waiter, although is very nice. He had a very strong undertone which i did not appreciate. It felt like we were kids and he was just serving us to take our money.

Anna W.,"San Leandro, CA",491,576,478,4.0,6/29/2011,"Of all the chain restaurants that we frequent (and we frequent many chains), Boyfriend ranks this chain as one of his favorites. The service has always been pretty friendly and the food is pretty decent for the price that you pay. The wait staff is always willing to split the check for you, which is always appreciated, especially when there is a large group of friends. I think one of my favorite things to see is how many late high school/college-aged girls come here, dressed to the nines (think clubwear). It's really not an upscale restaurant at all; I mean, it's not McDonald's, but it's not exactly Gary Danko either. The wait for dinner here can get pretty excessive, so call ahead on your way out there and get your name on their waiting list so your wait time isn't as painful once you get there (especially on Friday/Saturday nights). Boyfriend also really loves the beer selection here. They have a wide selection on tap (from my understanding), and they also have seasonal beers available on tap as well. Of their alcohol, I have only tried their Irish Root Beer -- which is delicious, but light (not that I can drink much anyway). One of my favorite items on their menu is their baked potato. It's HUGE, delicious, filling and cheap. What more can a starving college girl ask for? Their pizzas are also amazing, and a small or medium pizza is usually enough to share between two people (or it is for Boyfriend and I, but I also don't tend to eat a lot in general). Their nachos appetizer is also amazingly large -- we shared it among four people and still couldn't demolish it. BJ's, however, is famed for their Pizookie. It's probably one of the better desserts that I have ever had the pleasure of consuming and regretting (for, alas, I am lactose sensitive). I recommend getting the Pizookie Trio, so you can get three smaller Pizookies and try them all as opposed to just one large Pizookie. Be warned though; you'll get hooked. Giant, warm cookie topped with delicious ice cream? Be still, my artery-clogged heart (and please, please be still after, my poor upset tummy).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=740

TV screens and super loud, playing sports games and other things AND if you come at a rather bad time, angry men shouting while spitting bits of BBQ wings out of their mouth. Not a good look people.. 3.) Service was pretty bad. Even when our drinks were getting pretty low, no one would ask for refills.

This one, well unfortunately I can't say the same.  Being a bunch of 21 year olds, we wanted some alcohol and the girl who was serving us, who was very sweet, didn't know anything about the drinks. She wasn't 21 and they didn't teach her what to look for but its okay, still got what we wanted. Their beer is pretty good, a little too skunky for me but I'm always down to try something new.  The food was mediocre. I order the Pot Roast sandwich. It was messy, the pot roast was over cooked and the mash potatoes were very mushy.

Took us about 15 minute to order, and by the time we were ready, our waiters shift was over, and he came to our table to let us know, and showed us our new waitress. We ordered our food, and she didn't even bring them out. A Manager ended up bringing us our food. She took forever to bring us our check. We spent more time waiting for our check and to process our cards, then we spent eating our food. And when we asked her to bring to-go boxes, she attempted to pack them for us (I'm picky with my food), so I reached for one of the boxes on the table to pack my own leftovers, and she reached over and snatched it back out of my hand and said she got it, and I said no, it's okay, i'll pack my own.

Tiffany C.,"Fremont, CA",80,4,,4.0,1/29/2012,"I think by now I should be considered a regular here! Ever since I came back from college to the East Bay, I have gone to BJ's a ton just because there are very few places that are open late night on the weekends.  Venue is pretty big compared to the other BJ's I've been to. Place seems like a full house Thurs-Sat nights. If you come around 10/11PM there may be a 10-15 minute wait for a party of 2-4 people. Some people may consider the food to be a bit on the expensive side but I think the prices are pretty fair for the portions you get. The food is average in my opinion and I usually order the California Chicken Sandwich with Crispy Thin Fries. BJ's also has a small bites menu. Small bites meaning good for 1.5 persons.  There is a wide selection of beers but since I'm a beer hater...I can't elaborate on that part of the drink menu. Drinks are average prices (~$8-9) and are usually above average in strength. I usually get the enlightened drinks to try and make me feel better about consuming my high calorie sandwich/fries. The ""Skinny Rita"" is okay and is supposed to be the strongest of the enlightened drinks.( I suggest mixing it with a straw before drinking it.) I tried the ""Mojito Lite"" once and I hated it...I suggest sticking with the regular mojitos. Since I come here so much, I kind of wish they had happy hour.

This place is your typical BJ's--big restaurant, sports bar with big screens, lots of traffic.  Service was surprisingly good and the food came out fast.  I would definitely recommend this for big groups but to be honest, if you're a chain restaurant and not good at the opening, I don't know how good you'll be from then on!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=780

From the moment we walked in to the very end, the wait staff and managers on hand were very attentive.  Drinks were always refilled, they brought the food out as instructed as well as the cupcakes when it came time.  What's even great is that at the end of your allotted two hour time, you can take whatever is out in the buffet home.  So, we had everyone take some food home.

Service is a hit or miss with chain restaurants like BJ's. We we're lucky and got a great server. Moving on to the food, I wanted something light that evening so i choose the maui glazed pork chop with roasted red potatoes, green beans and grilled onion. Super delicious and i didn't feel like crap after. I love that they didn't over-cook their pork. The rest of my friends seem to enjoy their food as well! We also got the beer sampler, not a huge fan of beer but its cool to try the different kinds! Our night ended with their original chocolate chip cookie pizookie! I'm not a fan of dessert after dinner but this is a MUST! I have yet to try their other pizookie's, maybe next time! Things I've tried in the past that i really liked--Chicken pesto flatbread pizza, Avocado eggrolls, mini bruschetta, grilled chicken potato, and their yummy thin fries!

Aile M.,"Fremont, CA",0,29,,1.0,3/26/2010,"I took my friend here on the 03.19.10, and I was a bit surprised that the restaurant was packed at 9:30pm, so I thought this place might be something else. I was thinking ""Awesome,"" but it was a disappointment. I ordered an Angel Hair Pasta with shrimp, and my friend ordered something with meat on it. After ordering, I looked around in between conversations with my friend. The ambience of the restaurant was very modern and loud. Note, I do not mind the loudness at all. Huge TVs hung from the ceiling showing sports.  By the time the order arrived, it was half an hour. Half an hour wait is a big no, no for me. Furthermore, the waitress messed up my order--the shrimp was missing in the pasta. The waitress apologized, and somehow it was understandable. The thing that got me was the part that she did not take the shrimp-less pasta, but rather gave me a plate of fried shrimps on a smaller plate 20 minutes later to be added to the pasta, ""BY MYSELF."" I added the shrimp thinking the pasta would somehow change my mood, but I was dead wrong. The pasta was bland, as if it was made for a diabetic. The sauce was hard to notice, and I even doubted that there was sauce in it. I was so frustrated that I just ate some of the fried shrimps and even that was not even good. On the other hand, my friend ordered a steak that was supposed to be medium, but arrived well done. My friend ate the thing anyway because he was so hungry that night and did not even have the strength to argue. We moved on to the dessert and ordered triple oreos, which took another half an hour. I was like,""What the @#$%!"" The dessert did not require any cooking. You just slap them together and serve, but it still took half an hour? In my opinion, just skip this place and go to another restaurant. McDonalds is alot better than this. I do not have anyone that I hated enough to send to this place and die of frustration and starvation.

We went in after the lunch rush and this place looks pretty empty since it''s so big.  I mean there are people but it's so big it feels empty.  We sat ourselves (since there was no one to take us to the table) in the bar area's cozy booth and was greeted by our server, Karla, few minutes later. We made our order of  Root Beer - pretty good, but lacking something, served in ice cold mug. Chicken Wings - nice crispy skin and and moist with 2 sauces and celery sticks served on the side.  perfectly cooked without being too messy, you can put as much sauce as you like.  BJ's Favorite Mini Pizza - combination of yellow onion, bell pepper, sausage, peperoni, tomato and olives.  it was suppose to be deep dish pizza and it's nothing special.  I guess if you have a few, yeah, it's good, it won't matter anyway, right? Our server was pretty forgetful for not having a very busy service.  We asked for straws and she forgot and when we finally asked another server for it, the straws shows up.  Our food shows up and we had no utensils or napkins.  We helped ourselves with the napkins for the empty table next to us.  I witness the table behind also grabbed napkin utensils wrap from another empty table.  Our server was nice, but not very thoughtful. The ambiance and prices are very favorable.  The Chicken Wings was not bad and the Pizza was just ok, meh.  Need I talk about the service any more?

Elise G.,"San Jose, CA",166,890,2241,4.0,11/22/2010,"I like the setup of this BJ's better than those in Cupertino and San Jose.   The bar is dim, cozy, and inviting.  The backdrop is a puzzle of different flat screens displaying sports and there is plenty of seating in the bar area.  The pub tables are close enough to the bar top to be near friends and watch the games.  And there are booths available in the same area too.  I like that it's quieter than the other BJ's I've been to.  The place is pretty big.  There's no doubt that it can accommodate a lot of people.  But the ceilings are high so the noise travels upward and the layout makes the restaurant feel less cramped.  I would come back again just for the environment.   As far as food goes, it's pretty consistent with other BJ's chains.  The Pazookie is a memorable must.  Between four of us, we split the sampler with 3 different cookie pies topped with vanilla ice cream.  Of course that was after the hoard of appetizers we ordered. We got:  Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, Santa Fe Spring Rolls, Chicken Wings, Mini Tacos, Crispy Fried Artichokes, Stuffed Mushrooms, Crisp Potato Skins, BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders, and Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage Flat Bread Pizza. My top 3:   1.  I liked the BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders the best.  The sauce was flavorful and it came with fried onion strings inside.   2.  The Chicken wings were the best I've had in the area.  I like that they weren't saturated in sauce, the skin had a nice texture to them, and the meat was moist. 3.  Santa Fe Spring Rolls:  They were just plain tasty.  I liked the crispiness of the outside and how they were skinny and bite size so they didn't feel heavy. The beer was really good.  There's such a variety and there's a lot on tap.  My boyfriend ordered a bunch of different types in an attempt to work his way down the beer list.  I sampled his light and dark Belgian beers in a bottle and was pleased with both.   We'll be back again.  It was a great place to watch football at the bar over some good food and good beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=900

We had quite a few people so we shared a large deep dish pizza consisting of bj's cheeseburger/bacon and Mediterranean. The toppings were generous and the pizza dough was thick and fluffy.   2nd visit here was such a disappointment considering the last good experience. Everything was over oily and over done. The avocado rolls weren't as fresh as the first time and the consistency was very mushy,  The waiter who served us was not even mentally there. We asked for half veggie and half bj's favorite, and we pretty much just got bj's favorite with minimal toppings. What the hell happened?? Then we asked him, ""didn't we get half veggie?"" He then comes by and says, hey well look at this half it has less meat on it so it's pretty much your vegetarian slice right here! WOW, wtf... wrong response!

Diana L.,"Newark, CA",10,57,8,5.0,2/20/2012,"BJ's is by far one of my favorite brewery's. I give their beer, food and service 5 stars for several reasons. I've been here quite a few times and it never fails. We are always greeted by friendly staff. The waiters/ress are always very attentive and on point. I love coming here for their savory fresh Ahi Poke. It's chopped sashimi Ahi marinated in poke sauce with diced avocado. The Ahi is served with crispy wonton chips- so delicious. I've also tried their chicken noodle soup and the minestrone. They're both nothing special, but do their job as fillers. Their pear ciders are also quite delicious. If you love ciders, try the pear cider! Not the biggest fan of the berry pear cider because it's too sweet! The Margherita Fresca (has mozzarella, tomato sauce, fresh basil and parmesan cheese) and California Club (bacon, chicken, tomato & garlic aioli) flat bread pizzas are amazing! They are both crispy, fresh and flavorsome. I would recommend sharing appetizers and plates with your table to try different plates. Their BJ's Cobb Salad is also fresh and delicious! If you plan on going on a Friday or Saturday evening (or during a game), plan on waiting at the very minimum 1 hour. They are always packed- which in my opinion, is a great sign. They have a full bar and flat screen TV's all over. The place is loud with dim lights, but I love it! Plenty of parking too.

My group came here for a little surprise dinner for our friend's birthday & engagement. I had called the day before and made reservations with a manager. To my surprise, when we got to the restaurant they did not have my reservation. I was visibly upset and a little frantic as I was concerned that we wouldn't be able to pull off the surprise, but the hostesses didn't give me any information on when a table would be ready for me... they just gave me the little light up thing and told me it would light up when the table was ready. My friends and I went to the bar and sat there for 20 minutes and our table was still not ready. I went back to the hostess stand and explained the situation that this is a surprise party and the guest of honor will be arriving in 8 minutes. I asked for the manager, and they told me that they already talked to the manager and he said I didn't have a reservation. Their whole attitude was very nonchalant. It was obvious that they did not care about our situation that we were in because of their incompetence. Eventually we did get a table in the nick of time (thankfully the guest of honor was running late). Once we were sat we didn't see our waitress, Courtney, for a while. We were sitting their with empty glasses for a good 20 minutes before we could even find her to get another. I can say that she was probably one of the worst servers that we have ever had. She was absent the whole time, rarely checked up on us, NEVER refilled our waters, and was completely rude whenever she was at the table. The only time she was quick to get to the table was when she came to get our money and the gratuity that she absolutely did not deserve.  The management at this restaurant is terrible. Brenda, the manger i spoke with when i made my reservation is obviously incompetent. There is another woman manager (blond) who was on duty when i was there was either completely aloof of the situation, or lacked the managerial skills to do anything about it. There was a male manager on as well, he was better than the other two... but could definitely use some customer service training.  All in all, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. BJ's has great food and drinks, but this specific location has terrible service and worse management.  Good side: The brunette bartender was very kind and attentive and made fantastic drinks.

My expectations when it comes to dining are held at a higher level when it comes to BJ's. We were seated fairly quickly, helped out right away, and everything was going smoothly. One thing about his location that caused it to earn two stars was the fact that everything takes forever. After ordering and waiting 45 minutes for our food we were then approached by the waiter who let us know that both orders were messed up (baked potato was cooked wrong and my cajun pasta was taken to the wrong table). Cool, as long as they were being transparent and honest. Still sucked having this mix up though. We finally got our food after waiting about an hour and 15 minutes. I had become very impatient. Food was good, still prefer The Cheesecake Factory's cajun pasta over BJ's but still good. The waiter was cool though and she went out of her way to ""talk to her manager"" to get us a discount on our bill for the long wait. Awesome! Not so much, after waiting for our bill for another 15-20 minutes, we were told that we were going to get 50% off the baked potato, the pepsi, and the Shrimp Cajun Pasta. That's not what the bill reflected though! We got half off the baked potato and pepsi (the two cheapest items on the bill) and only $0.85 off of the pasta lol I didn't even bother trying to have them correct it, I just wanted to leave as soon as possible.

Lora R.,"Oakland, CA",183,118,79,4.0,5/20/2010,"We've been going since our first beer tasting here: though we only liked a few, we REALLY like them.  Their Hef is tasty and I really enjoy their laid back and welcome attitude whenever I go. I haven't actually sat in the full restaurant area: we just hang out in their bar section: service is always helpful and fast, though we typically have to ask for the check before it appears.  We have never once waited for a table, and I prefer the tall tables so I can sit high and swing my legs, pretending I'm both tall and a little girl.  Brownie points for them. Their menu is vegetarian, and certainly pescatarian friendly which is not the easiest to find at brew houses~  And the servers always know which stocks are used for their items, which is GREAT and keeps me from getting sick which I certainly appreciate. I haven't had anything I didn't thoroughly enjoy, and their soups are fabulous!  Their clam chowder was fresh and not too thick with lots of clams. The tomato-basil is lovely!  Salad options are wide since they make them fresh so asking to take the meat out is not a concern. I enjoy the games here because it's not so crwded or loud that you have to yell: but it's boisterous enough to keep interest and excitement going. Price range can jump easily if you're going for the microbrews or cocktails, but otherwise it's a good price for the quality and quantity.  They have the sort of dishes that don't look as big as they are so getting full is always easy!  And be sure to go during their happy hour: super-awesome pricing and getting drinks and appetizers becomes simple!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=940
Zain K.,"Louisville, KY",352,792,3,3.0,4/13/2010,"I've now sat here for about five minutes trying to think of something interesting or useful to say about this place, but to no avail.  It's true-to-formula suburban microbrewery restaurant, with a large selection of nondescript and slightly overpriced food, and about a half-dozen or so home brews, none of which were special.  At 10p on a Monday night there was a line, so this is apparently what Fremonters (or Newarkers,  or whatever) do on a Monday night.  A safe bet if you're in the area and looking for something predictable to eat, but you're feeling venturesome you can do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=940
Mary W.,"Portland, OR",28,67,76,4.0,6/7/2010,"Their BBQ chicken deep dish pizza had a super yummy crust - thick and fluffy and the bottom a little crunchy, not like a dense Chicago style deep dish. Got the big appetizer sampler: Avocado rolls and Santa Fe rolls were good. Artichoke dip with tortilla chips was not very exciting. There were also mozzarella sticks but didn't try them. Went on a busy Sunday night and had to wait 30-40 minutes for a table so it's understandable due to the number of people that service would be on the slower side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=940
Jamie T.,"Newark, CA",16,9,1,1.0,2/9/2015,"ZERO STARS!!!! Management is horrible particularly Desiree. Our server was slammed in the bar and appeared to be new. My kid's drinks came out after my husbands beer and my soda. I let that slide. While I was waiting or our meal I watched how Desiree the manager, talked with 3 servers just standing around. If it's not busy enough where you can all stand around talking then either help the girl struggling or go the F&$& home! While I'm still observing the manager and her unprofessionalism. My husband and two children received their meals. The food pony then came back to tell me that they were just making the lettuce wraps. These were ordered of their happy hour menu and are not regular sized which is fine but a burger and two kids meals were done before. We were not once checked on by our server or offered refills. After out meals were done for 10 min. and still no one my husband told the hostesses we needed the manager so we could let her know of our unpleasant experience as well as the bill. In comes Desiree who we had to interrupt from her 20 min conversation. She picked up my husbands dish and without talking to is shouted to our poor overwhelmed server to get our bill. When out server walked over I told her to bring her manager back. When Desiree came back she said all you wanted was the bill right?! That's when my patience ran out! I told her had she picked up more than one dish from the table or not talked for the last 20 min and noticed me trying to get her attention that maybe she would know how unpleasant our dining experience was. I told her we never got a refill, my sons drinks came out last and my lettuce wraps were never made like the rest of the order. She the. Said, ""Fine do you want me to take off the lettuce wraps?"" At that point I told her she should do more which she didn't and how unprofessional she is for talking for the last 20 min about non business related items with employees while our server struggled. Normally I don't ask for discounts but at that point the bill should've been mostly comped not the happy hour lettuce wraps which was the cheapest for her to take off. I AM SO IRRITATED! Next is corporate. She needs to be trained again....BJ's service is starting to turn into the quality you got at Red Robin before they closed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=940

Example of time i liked: Bartender was great, very friendly, quick and even came up with a new tasty drink with me since ive been dieting and trying to keep low calories. Since i was gonna eat their food i figured drinks better be kinda light. Enjoyed happy hour and had some appetizers.  Example of time i hated: Had a pretty large group about 12 people so wait was a while but front host was great and We finally got seated. We all ordered our food from mrs. grouchy hates her job waitress but when it started coming we were getting more appetizers than we ordered. We all knew what we ordered so we gave em back to her cuz they werent ours. She never came by our table but for our orders and when food arrived. No refills or ""anything else?"" or ""would anyone like dessert?"" i even walked to the bar to get a glass of water. Totally abandoned :( then when our bill came the appetizers that werent ours that we never ordered or ate we were still charged for.

Chris C.,"Union City, CA",51,549,15,4.0,4/30/2009,"My friends decided to take me to BJs for a belated B-Day Dinner. BJs is a chain brewery that kind of reminds me of a what will happen if you mix Gordon Biersch with Cheesecake Factory, a decent brewery with massive amounts of high caloric food.  The most important thing to know about this location is that the lines are RIDICULOUS LONG. So best to call in ahead of time and have them reserve you a spot like we did. Even with the call in, we still had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated. People were waiting outside the door to get into this place.  The interior here is nice (kind of in the style of Cheesecake Factory) with plenty of flat screen TVs all over the place. The best way to describe the menu is that it's American Bar Food so we're talking about deep dish pizza, burgers, sandwiches, big salads, etc. Prices here are reasonable. Most appetizers (sliders, nachos, wings) will cost you between $5 - $9, sandwiches and burgers $7 - $10, and entrees such as pizza, steaks, chicken, etc you're looking at the $10 - $17 range. Also they have a couple of vegetarian options such as a veggie burger, veggie pizza, and some pasta dishes.  We looked over the menu and I decided to put in an order of their Blonde Beer and an open faced meatloaf sandwich, my wife got the salad and the baked potato, my friend got the chicken club, and his wife put in an order of mozzarella sticks and the chicken lettuce wraps. We chatted for a bit and our drink orders came up. The blonde was good. It had a light taste to, was really smooth which I liked, and didn't have an after bite at all.  Then about 10 minutes later came the mozzarella sticks and the salad. Portion here are definitely on the generous side. I would guess we probably got about dozen or so mozzarella sticks and the ""side"" salad was pretty generous. Veggies in the salad tasted good and not like its been sitting around for a while and the mozzarella sticks tasted like they were fresh out of the fryer and had a good crunch while keeping a good ""gooey"" cheese taste inside.  Next came our meals, and holy mountains of food Batman, I mean, they must think we are sumo wrestlers or something because they brought out a TON of FOOD. My open faced meatloaf sandwich must have weighed a couple of pounds because the sucker was stack. It had a nice garlic bread on the bottom, a 2 inch thick slice of meatloaf, and a mountain of mash potatoes with gravy and fried onion rings on top (oh yeah it also came with some steamed veggies to make it ""healthy""). My wife got a potato that was on steroids because it was the size of a Nerf Football, and my friend and his wife got equally as large portions.  Eating the open faced sandwich, it was really good. It's been a while since I've had meatloaf and the combination of flavors was just great. The meatloaf was moist and the mash potatoes had no lumps in it. I tasted my wife's steroid potato and that was pretty good. It was basically cheddar cheese with steamed veggies on top. We were disappointed that they didn't offer sour cream and chives with it because that would have taken the potato to the next level. My friends seem to enjoy their meal too.  After only eating half our meal, I boxed it up and got my B-Day Pizookie. There's not enough good things to say about Pizookie, a nice warm chocolate chip cookie about 5 inches in diameter fresh out of the topped with vanilla ice cream. If anything, it's worth getting the Pizookie. It was a nice way to end probably a 2000 calorie meal.  The service here was nice and friendly. As to ratings, kind of hard for me on this one. Yes I would come back, but would a wait longer than 20 minutes, probably not, and judging by the lines out the door people are waiting somewhere in the 45 minute range. But I can't blame a place for being popular. Overall a 3.5 star experience, but good enough to round up to 4 stars.

Britney C.,"San Francisco, CA",85,201,50,3.0,5/11/2009,"Came here on Mother's Day (yesterday) with my fiance and his family for the first time. We started off with some appetizer sampler that consisted of the avocado egg rolls, Santa Fe spring rolls, mozzarella sticks and the spinach and artichoke dip. The avocado rolls which came with some sweet dipping sauce was pretty good as this was the first place that I have seen them offered. And I love avocado. Everything else was pretty typical and could be found at every other chain restaurant. For my entree, I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken which came with mashed potatoes and some kind of sauce. I got two huge pieces of chicken which I ended up taking one home. The sauce that was drizzled on it was pretty blah and probably would have tasted better with some kind of honey mustard or tangy sauce to compliment the saltiness of the parm. The mashed potatoes were also pretty bland and I didn't really touch it after a few bites.  Service was not great but not bad. It was a busy night so I'll cut our waitress some slack.  Since I'm pregnant, I couldn't try any of the beers. =( I know, what's the point in going to a brewery if you can't drink beer?!?!

Sandy N.,"Fremont, CA",37,232,181,2.0,11/19/2009,"Well don't know what their deal was on this Wed night, but it wasn't good. Typically when I come here - all goes well, service and such...not this time...  So its about 10 min to 7, I remembered to call in for call ahead seating, I know its not a reservation but you get placed on the waiting list. 10 min later we get there. I said my name and that I called in. Still the lady said it was going to be 15 min. I was thinking well wtf did I call in for? So there we stand my son and husband. 15 min passes, 20 min...Then I see other parties being seated...ok. So I go and ask the lady (different one - other went on break or something) and I said I called it in and whats taking so long, she said ""Oh we had you as not in yet"". WTF? Then she said that I will be next on the list...then right after a party of 3 were seated (I assumed we were going to be next!) Then this is what really pisses me off, a party of 3 just walks in - she said she called in. Then about 5 min later her pager goes off and they are seated - by this time I was flamed! a min later ours goes off and I toss it onto the counter just extremely dissatisfied at this point.  We were then seated, menus were passed out. Then the excruciating wait - had to be at least 20 min before the waitress came by. We ordered our drinks those came, we ordered the calamari - came out in about 10 min, though they were extremely greasy and somewhat soggy. But my son didn't care and ate them - or else Id have them replace them but at this point my son was starving. My son and I had waters to drink, hubby got OJ. So when my son needed a refill he did get one, but it just took way longer than usual. My husband was never offered a refill or at least a water on the side.  I admit out entrees were good (I got the pizza, hubby got a steak and son got chicken tenders) Our waitress was virtually unavailable.  Either they need to hire more staff (both on the floor and the kitchen) or they need to train the waitresses on better service.  So we get our check and we had our coupon for $5 off, after she came back with the new receipt, she had knocked off $10 - I thought good.  My hubby likes to give a good tip, he was knocking down like $9 or so. I said why? the service stunk & the wait stunk. So he puts down $5.  So I suppose the next time we go here - we will go before the dinner rush, but we thought 7 was sorta late and that it wasn't going to be to crowded. I will still call in and I will make sure the person who checks us in knows that I did call in.

Last Tuesday, we were seated almost instantly & on Saturday, we had pretty good timing as people were leaving the bar and openned up just the right number of seats. Tuesday's picks: + Balsamic Glazed Chicken: I'll swear by it everytime. It's a pretty well-rounded meal. I've been lucky to never get under/over-cooked chicken. + Strawberry Confusion: Tasted great but I couldn't taste any of the alcohol.  + Pizookie: If you've never had one, treat yourself to a couple moments of bliss. A giant cookie & ice cream are sure to bring a satisfied smile to your face everytime. Saturday's picks: After spending the day wine tasting in Livermore, all I wanted was soup. + Broccoli & Cheddar in a sourdough bread bowl: The bread was yummy, but the soup was SO salty... I'm glad I had the bread to balance it out a little. + Mango Mojito: Another overly sweet mixed drink... Couldn't taste the alcohol. Yummy nevertheless.

Our server finally brought out our appetizer but forgot to bring the water. We reminded her and it took another 10 minutes to get water and extra napkins. The food was just okay. Our silverware was dirty and I asked her for another set which took sooooo long. We had to ask for more water. Maybe I wouldn't have been so annoyed if she was actually friendly. I asked to speak to the manager. I seen the server talking to her before she came to my table. I told the manager how horrible my service was and how I had to ask for EVERYTHING.

Niza H.,"Fremont, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/1/2011,"Never, never again will I go back to this place. The food is okay but the service is so horrible that I would rather stay home.  My friends and I've been to a couple of different BJ's locations and the food and drinks are always good so when we moved to Fremont we decided to check out the closest one in Newark for my friend's birthday. Big mistake.  We had a reservation so we were seated immediately. That was the only good part of the night. First, the waiter forgot to bring me my drink, twice. And his hand writing was so bad that the bar tenders had to come over to our table to ask what we ordered 'cause they couldn't read the ticket. So that took forever.  Once we ordered food, it got worse. As starters, a couple of us got salads and one got an appetizers. The waiter brings out the pizza stands and the condiments, but no starters. Twenty mins later, a salad comes out. The other salad and appetizer doesn't come out until long after the first one is completely gone. It's been over an hour at this point, but we were a big party so we expect it to take a bit longer for us, but not like this. We wait. And wait. Finally our food comes out. It's cold, my burger is undercooked, but we eat anyways. Nobody's gotten a refill at this point, even though most of the glasses have been empty since before the first salad arrived. I have to stop one of the other waiters to ask for refills since our waiter doesn't bother to check up on us.  The last straw for me was when the waiter didn't want to split up the check for us. He said it would take him too long to figure it out so he told us to just do it ourselves. So we split up the check, tax and gratuity as well (We were a party of 12 so it's automatically put in). He comes back with the receipts for us to sign, and we noticed that he's put an additional tip for himself on the receipts. So we send those back and wait. Finally the manager has to come over and sort everything out. The whole process took over half an hour. Needless to say, we were all pretty pissed off by the end.

This place reminds me of Vegas for some reason"". The decor is trendy, modern and cool. I liked it!  We were seated immediately and had great wait service.

I am sure within the year this area will be really desirable with new and shiny stores. But BJ stands all alone pretty well. Their parking lot is a bit strange for some reason but there is plenty of parking because of Mervyns being unoccupied.

Reese S.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",33,108,183,4.0,8/5/2011,"This place deserves at least a 3.5 average rating. I mean, 3 is just an average joint. BJ's brews their own beer and sodas. That's not average. That's brilliant. Upon mention of the home-brewed sodas, I decided to try out their Cream Soda. It was delightfully fizzy and sweet, but not too sweet. It had far better cream flavor than that store-bought stuff. I do not drink sodas, but this was good. I ordered the Smoked Turkey Cobb. Very tasty. Let me give you then run down: layers of smoked turkey adorned by lettuce, tomato, cheese, applewood bacon, avocado, and Dijon mayonnaise sit atop a toasted, garlic and cheese French roll. The roll was the best part of the sandwich, and the sole purpose for my ordering it. It was crispy and crunchy as any good toasted roll should be; the garlic and cheese sent me to another realm of Bread Heaven. I love me some bread, and this roll was packed with flavor. This is not just some run-of-the-mill plain jane sandwich bread. This stuff rocks. The bacon added a nice smokey flavor that paired well with the smoke of the turkey. The Dijon mayonnaise added flare and a creaminess to balance the crunch.  As any sensible person should do when eating at BJ's, I ordered the Pizookie. Think of the warmest, gooiest, chunkiest cookie, then think of cold, creamy ice cream...that is the Pizookie. But what differentiates this dessert from the normal cookie and ice cream crap served everywhere else is its cooking method. The dough is placed in a thin metal dish, and baked like a small pizza. Then the ice cream is dolloped on top, melting constantly into a river of creamy delight. The options are many: chocolate chunk, peanut butter, oatmeal raisin walnut, and macadamia nut. All the best cookies. Vanilla bean ice cream is the only one offered for the normal Pizookie. I ordered the chocolate chunk (had to go with the classic). Phenomenal. The best thing of the night. It was so warm and so gooey with large chocolate chunks that just oozed and melded with the creamy ice cream. And vanilla bean was a great flavor selection on BJ's part. It has a distinct flavor, and pairs well with a fresh cookie. I felt like Santa, but on a planet where the cookies aren't stale after sitting there all night, but rather cookied while I was coming down the chimney; and instead of boring milk, I was given the best thing ever created: ice cream. The place is very loud, the service is not very good, and it is darker than Mordor (hence my lack of food pictures).  Come for the Pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=980

Our server was much cheerier! I wonder why haha. No, but he was a nice enough guy who seemed a bit distracted at times, but he was handling many tables all at once. Gave us completely fresh glasses of water, about 2 times for each of us. He gave us some recommendations when we were stuck between two very tantalizing choices, and we took his word for it, thankfully. We ordered from the lunch menu; very affordable choices with great value I'd say - about $6.25. Eventually, I went with the Margherita Fresca (?).. just completely butchered that haha, but hey, it was tres bon. It came with a small side of salad and 4 mini pieces of pizza, which I didn't take to go for what seems like the first time in ages because 1.) the wait was long!

Completely rude! It was my friend Sasha's 22nd Birthday, so we first-things-first; We marched up to the bar to buy her a few drinks. It did't take the 7 of us long to realize that our bartender that had been tending to the same group before I had gotten there, was completely oblivious to our business. He was rude, he ignored us, wasn't very good at taking our orders, and even TIPPED himself from my change!I didn't even get my $5 change back for my drinks. Because he took the change for himself, I ended up being forced to tip him more than my drink cost.  Now I'm not a miser - If you do really well and are friendly, I will tip you $10 for your effort to please me as a customer, because face it, places need patrons in order to do well. Too bad they stiffed one who is an avid yelper. Food took a while to come through, but our waitress (tall skinny caucasian girl) was very sweet, accomodating and helpful. LOVED HER! We were in a goup of over 20, and she was very calm about how crazy it was. But the bartender! No matter how many times we went back (And we spent at least $200 at the bar) this ""Robert"" character was incredibly rude. He even almost gave me a DIRTY glass. Are you freaking kidding me? Luckily a smarter, kinder bartender behind him pointed out that fact quickly and then took over the task of making my drink. Good guy, but I didn't catch his name. Overall, BJ's was so overrated.

Rana A.,"San Francisco, CA",89,400,175,1.0,3/8/2009,"It's nice to see that Fremont has a restaurant that is open past 10pm. The food here is ok, but the service is really bad! We had a party of 13 and they told us it'd be an hour and a half. Knowing this was a lie we stuck around the bar until our table was ready. About 25-30 minutes later we see a table being cleared off. I walk over to the hostess stand to ask if we can/were going to sit there. I was mid way through my sentence and she walks away.... No excuse me, just walks away. At first I thought ""what just happened? then I was PISSED! I talked to the other hostess about what just happened and she told me to ignore her ""because she's weird"". I don't give a F**K if you're weird!!!This is your JOB!!  Anyhow I go to complain to the most senior manager and all he says is ""I'm sorry"". I apprecaite the apology, but he didn't even try to make me happy. He didn't offer to discuss the matter with the hostess, offer a complimentary dessert or possibly a voucher for the next visit. Just I'm sorry.  Luckily our server was kind and gracious. She was very efficient with us and checked up on us frequently. We all left happy and full, but that hostess' behavior left a bad taste in my mouth that I don't plan to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=980
Florence W.,"Fremont, CA",122,281,27,4.0,3/28/2009,"Same great service as always, but I tried two dishes that I'd like to write about. Last week I tried the balsamic glazed chicken ($10.95) and I wouldn't recommend that to others, unless you like your chicken well done. I found the portion to be a bit smaller than the other dishes, but it would fulfill an average appetite like mine. It is a bit on the healthier side with lean grilled chicken under a bed of greens. The only thing a little unhealthy (meaning DELISH!) in this dish is the white cheddar mash.  Today I tried the parmesan crusted chicken ($11.95) because two different people told me I had to try it. The two large chicken breasts were pan-fried to perfection with this lemon butter sauce which I ordered on the side. I had steamed broccoli and white cheddar mash on the side. This was awesome and could only finish one chicken breast and the broccoli--huge portions! The sauce was worth the 12 bucks alone--but be warned, it IS a butter based sauce, so try no to go overboard! Both times I came here I had to really control my appetite because I am head over heels in love with their cajun chicken pasta--it sucks to be on a low-carb diet!  Once again, it is IMPERATIVE that you request a table in Joanna's, Arthur's, or Jackie's section. These three are the best servers BJ's could ever hope for--kind, funny, not too chatty, quick, and overall awesome!  Final Verdict: My low carb diet has limited my choice of food, denying my tummy of carbs puts me in a bad mood. Cue BJ's Brewery, because they can't do any wrong, they're vast selection makes me want to break out in song!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=980

The place was overly crowded and the waiters have it out of control all the time. Once we got seated our food arrived in 30 minutes. The potato fries were not crispy ( that's the only thing you expect from fries really) The pizza was OK and not hot and so was the pasta.  The Pizzokie was also mediocre.

Alex R.,"Phoenix, AZ",52,70,1,4.0,2/8/2009,"An unfortunate name for such a good place. My friend suggested we go to this place because its his favorite place. I had not heard of it before so I figured it was worth a try.   I walked into this place and was impressed. The high ceilings and open layout of the restaurant were really nice.  I was even more impressed when my friend had told me that they brewed their own beers. Sadly this trip I didn't try any but I will next time for sure. I decided I was in the mood for chili. My friend wanted appetizers and said I had to try the pizza. Knowing full well I was going to Yelp this place I decided to go with it all and just sample what I could.  The chili was delicious. It was perfectly cooked with a little bit of spice. The top was covered in a layer of melted cheese with a dollop of sour cream in the middle and some chives. Perfect toppings for chili. We got the appetizers sampler thing with spinach and artichoke dip, avocado egg rolls, santa fe spring rolls, mozzarella sticks. The appetizers really weren't that impressive. I ate all my mozzarella sticks but left most of the rest on the plate. It's not that big of a deal to me because I rarely order appetizers unless its nachos.  On to the pizza. At first I almost waived off the pizza entirely. I mean it said it was deep dish pizza and I figured it couldn't compare to Zachary's or Patxi. Plus the pictures did not look like the deep dish pizza I had had before. When the pizza was delivered I shoveled out a slice grabbed my knife and fork and dove in. I was impressed their pizza was a much doughier version of my previous experiences with deep dish. It has a big puffy crust with very little sauce and then is loaded with cheese and toppings. After the first bite I was a fan. I sat there trying to convince my stomach I wasn't full and could finish my slice and have another. It was an uphill battle but I managed.  During the course of our meal my friend said that this was his favorite restaurant and wanted to come here for his birthday I told him he totally should and do it on a night i don't have class so I can go. He agreed. So hopefully some time next week I will be able to go back and try a burger and get a sampling of their beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1000

Mediterranean Pizza however is a bit too strong for me the pesto sauce and blue cheese is overwhelming.  Service was a little inconsistent since we had a waitress who was still under training.

We also ordered a dessert.  a pazookie i was told.  This dish is one of the best desserts i have had.  Great flavor but had a homey vibe to it that makes you think you can recreate it at home.  Also our service was top notch.  Our lady server was hella funny.  I was talking shit with my friends and what not and she was even giving me some comebacks.  Very cool girl and witty.  Also she gave us some stuff for free and gave us a discount, I'm guessing it was the shit talking and goofing around we did with her.

Will S.,"San Jose, CA",98,208,84,3.0,7/15/2009,"After spending a LOOOOOONG time deciding on where to go after dinner, we settled on this BJ's in Newark. Good thing for us, it was happy hour.  So out of all the BJ's I know, THIS ONE has a revolving door. We walked in around 10pm and happy hour seating was scarce. There were barely seats open at the bar and we needed 4 spots. Some guy sitting at the bar was being shady, not wanting to move down one seat so that our group could sit together. JERK. Luckily one of the bartenders pointed out a table open for us to sit. (Good lookin' out).  We all ordered a round of shots first, then moved onto beers. We started off with Patron-chilled. Always good. A friend of mine said there wasn't enough salt on his glass. So he tried adding more to it with the table salt. Haha. It was a no-go but good try.  We followed the shots with a round of beer. I had a P.M. Porter. It was a nice dark beer (usually good for meaty dishes). Mmmm. Real smooth. I forget what kind of beer 2 of my friends ordered but it was a light beer, rather sweet. I had a sip and liked it very much. Another friend of mine ordered a Jeremiah Red. It was somewhat of a dark beer but still had a nice crisp to it. That same friend and I decided to take another shot of Grey Goose-chilled. Seriously, chilled is the way to go. The check was somewhere around $55. But I wound up paying $20, tax and tip for my 2 shots and beer. Quite good, being that it was happy hour. Service was great. Our server kept checking in on us to make sure everything was ok, even if we did just order drinks.  The location was a bit questionable. I pulled up and saw some abandoned building behind B.J.'s with some graffiti and automatically thought ""O...K. Ghetto."" I shouldn't be one to judge but I couldn't help myself.  Anyway, this B.J.'s was nice and perhaps I'll return sometime in the future. But I'm from San Jose and there are closer ones nearby.

One table member ordered a colorful, attractive, Italian dinner salad, however she found it tasted bland.  She requested a different dressing plus a side of parmesean which were promptly served; she seemed appeased with the supplemental trimmings.  Having advance knowledge of B J's exclusive creme soda and root beer, I opted for the former.  So delicate and smooth, it was nothing like that traditional, harsh grocery store beverage.   Bottom line, the experience was amazingly positive for this Newark chain eatery.  In fact, I enjoyed the meal more than those I've feasted on at the Claim Jumper.  Plus the ambiance is a notch more comfortable too.  We'll be coming back soon as I'm anxious to try out B J's jambalaya!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1040
Kermy K.,"Fremont, CA",25,310,,2.0,5/11/2009,Great for drinks and sports.  Not good for food. Their utensils and plates are so dirty. So many times I've found bugs in the glasses or left over things on forks and the benches/chairs. Their food is bleh. I found a hair in the pizza once. Their shrimp in pasta is theeeee tiniest shrimp I have ever seen. I felt bad eating it bc  I thought it musta been a baby shrimp. Forget about counting calories in the food. The desserts are sorry.

Roopali S.,"Fremont, CA",2,33,,1.0,9/12/2014,Where do I begin. After a long wait I called ahead to be informed that there is no option to reserve seat for three or more persons in advance and i was conveniently added in call ahead sheet or list or whatever that is supposed to be. It was my husband's birthday so I asked them to inform the server to add that in as well. I was told that the request was considered but you need to again inform when you walk-in. I was like OK! Come evening my husband and I with our child check in and are told that unfortunately we were never added on the call ahead list so now you have to wait like all others. On top of that the server we got couldn't follow an ounce of English and brought food in like super late. Finally the surprise never happened I went and asked the manager and he says will take care of it again I wait patiently requesting my husband to sit at the table one way or the other nothing happened. I paid the check and expressed my disappointment to the manager on the way out he didn't seem to give rat's ass. Well so much for loving BJ's. I visited the one in Cupertino so much practically did a project on them at school. Now I feel some other deserving restaurant could have had been my subject of observation. Well never mind I for one am never going back to others who want to venture out all I say is good luck! Manager manager wake up.

Naren C.,"Fremont, CA",0,11,,2.0,5/21/2012,"Not a huge fan of this place and its mainly because of the wait, but also because their food is mediocre at best. The deep dish pizza is nothing like it should be, it should have layers of sauce, toppings, and cheese but its just a buncha dough. They have more than routinely gotten my order incorrect, which I don't really appreciate after having to wait a half hour for my food. At that point it's not really worth sending back and risk it coming back with spit, a half hour later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1040
Chris C.,"San Ramon, CA",232,294,9,4.0,1/19/2009,"I had a group of 25 here a few days ago. Any group larger than 19 has to be a 'banquet', which I setup a month in advance. The banquet menu has different combinations of things, usually the entree is all you can eat with complimentary soda. I went for the four pizza and added individual pizookies. You get 2 hours for your session, so if you start at 6pm, you would end at 8pm. I had Great White, BJ's favorite, Sweet Pig and another one which I forget as well as the class pizookie. Overall things were fine, the staff was friendly, and we got through round and a half of pizza. They didn't really give me a full-second round of pizzas though, I only remember 2 or 3 of the four getting replaced (maybe they weren't totally empty when they did the swap). Not a big deal, but I went for seconds only to find that there wasn't another Great White. I could have said something, but none of my guests were complaining so I let it slide. Overall, it was a great dinner for my friends, but it would have been difficult had I not set it up in advance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1040
Rachelle R.,"Fremont, CA",56,69,27,3.0,12/3/2008,"I took away two stars due to my experience last night.  Good 'ol tuesday night...a girlfriend and i make our way to grab a beer(PM Porter, it's my favorite right now) and the bartender tells me that they are OUT of ALL but one of their HOUSE brewed beers! It was such a bummer. It's like going to Baskin Robin's to enjoy the options of 31 flavors and they tell you they are out of vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and chocolate chip??!!  I asked the bartender if he could suggest a similar type beer and he pretty much offered me a Guiness. ew. I could go to Safeway and buy a can. No thank you sir. Here's a tip: Beer comes in on Wednesday's, Tuesday is the WORST day to go. If i would have known ahead of time,  i would have just went to Mission Pizza off Washington Blvd. what i love about BJ's in Newark: 1. PM Porter is a MUST 2.

But I also worry that a lot of time, even with CHAIN restaurant, the fremont version(or newark version) is the worst compared to other location. When this BJ first open, the shrimp pasta dish I got , is not that good,  the pasta is not even 100% cooked(very hard). Now, I went back for second time, after a few months later, food seem to be better. Actually this is one of the good chain restaurant I like. I am glad this location is getting better, but the waiting line could be long even in thursday night, so plan accordingly. The price and portion is pretty good deal in this restaurant.  Beer is good. I am still happy that there is BJ in Fremont/Newark area. Since this Fremont area, usually has NOT MUCH RESTAURANTS to choose from.

Michelle W.,"Union City, CA",187,389,1256,3.0,3/30/2009,"So I have mixed reviews about BJ's. Let me break it down: FOOD - 4 stars. Huge portions, great flavor, wide variety. My favorite are the chicken wangs and deep dish pizza. It's even more delicious during happy hour because appetizers are $2 off and mini pizzas are half off. Even though there's a huge selection of beer, I like their berry cider for HH. And onto their famous pizookies, that alone deserves 5 stars. I used to get the white chocolate & macadamia cookie, until I discovered OREO PIZOOKIE aka the holy grail of pizookies. LOCATION - 2 stars. Don't get me wrong, I've been saying BJ's needed to come to Fremont for years now and I was escstatic when they did, but what's up with opening it up in a run down plaza across the street from Newpark? I know there's going to be tons of remodeling in that area, so I hope they remodel the parking lot cuz it's a lil retarded. I would think Pacific Commons off Automall would've been more adequate. SERVICE - 2 stars. Very mediocre to me. It's a challenge trying to flag them down. One of the HH waitresses tried to rip me off the other day by keeping my change in her folder thinking she was going to get an $18 tip for a $40 tab. Girrrrrl, you must be trippin! Good thing my Chinese math skills kicked into gear and I spoke up when I figured I should be getting $10 in change, or else she would've walked off with my monies. That was shady.

Tiffany K.,"Fremont, CA",904,996,49,3.0,12/7/2008,"Wow, a BJ's in Fremont, well Newark technically? I feel like im in Cupertino!  This particular location is around the same size as the one in South San Jose. Upon entering the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was the rotating glass doors. I thought this was really really odd for a restaurant like BJ's. It doesn't fit with the environment whatsoever, and it just caused unnecessary traffic and issues when the 15 year olds were running in circles and holding the doors so their friends couldn't get through. The service really wasn't that great here... While waiting for a table, my girlfriend and I decided to go to the bar. It took forever to get someone's attention since it was packed - and one of the bartenders just stood there staring off into space, totally not realizing that we were trying to get a drink. One of the bartenders who was actually busy, had to ask her to help us. Our waiter was fine in the beginning, and just totally disregarded us towards the end. After clearly finishing our food, since I left my plate at the end of the table, our waiter just kept walking right past our table not even asking us if we were done or needed boxes or our check or anything. After we finished eating, it took him about 20 minutes to finally come and ask if we needed help. As far as the food, I got a grilled chicken alfredo pasta, and it was okay. my food came out cold. Overall, this BJ's is okay. After trying three BJ's, the Cupertino location is still the best.... however, im gunna have to come back one day just to get a Pizookie. Can't really mess that one up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1040
Agnes G.,"Hayward, CA",0,11,,1.0,5/13/2014,"I was a fan of this place when it first opened a few years ago, however throughout the years their quality has deteriorated.

The manager did not charge me for this however it did make me weary of the place. My other experiences were not great as well with my food being cold.

Annie M.,"San Jose, CA",7,22,11,1.0,2/3/2009,"ABSOLUTELY the worst service!!  We drove from Tracy to take my mom out for her Birthday Dinner.  We decided to go to the new resto across Newpark Mall only to experience the worst service we've ever experienced in restaurants!!  When the hostess sat us down she offered us the beer menu and I said no but can I have a coke, she replied ""I would get you a coke but I'm not your server"" and left.  She didn't even reply by telling me she would let my server know.  She was pretty rude!! The place wasn't so busy since it was a Monday night.  When our server finally showed up, we placed our orders and when our meal was served, no ketchup, A1 Sauce or hot sauce was delivered.  Just the plain salt and pepper on the table when we arrived.  When I asked for the A1 sauce, she gave me a dirty look and walked away.  Instead of us enjoying my mom's birthday, our conversation was just about how poor the service is and how our server was rude and her facial reaction was unacceptable.  Aside from my brother in law joking about how the hostess made me feel stupid about not being our server, our waitress being rude didnt make the birthday celebration a celebration.   After we finished dinner, I asked her about birthday celebrations.  She said rudely that they don't do the singing thingy, which was fine with us but she didn't have to respond so rudely.  She described the birthday cake and asked if we wanted the dessert menu.  She gave me the dessert menu and took forever to come back.  She was fast on delivering the bill though. When she finally came around about the dessert, we lost our appetite!  Paid in cash because it took her forever to get the bill and we decided to pay in cash instead of Credit Card.  She's lucky we gave her a tip.  WIth that service, I will NEVER come back to this resto.  I'd rather wait 3 hrs for a table at Claim Jumpers since their payback is excellent service! venue:  The resto is nicely decorated! lots of space and not crowded.  Seems like they've put so much effort into the decor of the resto and absolutely NO TIME on training their servers!   Only props was to the bus boy who didn't complain and had a smile on his face.  We asked for a plastic bag for the to-go box the waitress forgot to bring us and he got it right away.  When we asked for a refill, he didn't reply by saying he's not our server.  He got us another refill with no sarcastic look on his face. I don't recommend this place!  THEY NEED TO WORK on their SERVICE.  I'd hate to name names but our server was REALLY aweful and she ruined my mom's birthday celebration with her rude service!  The receipt said our server is Chantell B. OMG! I just tried calling the resto to speak to the manager (to complain about how the server RUINED my mom's birthday Dinner)  and when I first called, it rang 3 times then someone hung up and the second time I called someone named Erica answered and I asked for the manager.  She was really polite on the phone but I was on hold for more than 10 minutes.  5 minutes too long I'd say!  I forgot who I was calling for being on hold for so long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1020

Evan T.,"Newark, CA",10,34,4,1.0,12/21/2008,"So i went here to celebrate a birthday and well... we didnt' reserve in advance but 1.5 hours wait for a BJ's?  It's not like this place is a high class restaurant or anything.  i've been to the bj's in cupertino and that place gets  a thumb up from me since its got decent service and the food is aight. So this newark location... well I dunno what it is.  Perhaps it speaks to the quality of people in Newark/Fremont area, but the service here is absolutely awful.   I'm a simple guy, and when I don't know what to order, I usually order what the place is known for.  So since its a brewery, a beer and possibly a burger or pizza.  I decided to go with the calzone, and i asked the waiter what he'd recommend in terms of beers to compliment what I ordered.  He recommended a beer that he liked, but when i read the description it wasn't something recommended for a pizza-type dish.  I was whatever about it. So i had a party of 4, and everyone got their food in a relatively reasonable time... everyone 'cept me.  The person that brought the food to our table wasn't even our server and I asked ""what about my food?"" and of course he didn't know what i ordered and he said he would go check on it.  Never came back. Halfway through my party's meal, I said...alright 10 more minutes and if nothing happens, I'm taking off and the bill's on them. 7 minutes rolls by and our server comes by and i'm like...uhh i got nothing from what i ordered. He said.. umm, what did you order?  I told him and he walked off to 'check on it' and he said... its still cooking.  i'm like right, probably just started.  Finally he came back with my calzone 5-6 minutes later and i was like, ""umm and my beer?"" It was already too late.  My meal was messed up.  I should have at least gotten my beer at the beginning, and now i have to rip through it with my meal, instead of enjoy my meal in peace. When the bill came, i told him, 'i'd like to at least be comped for my beer"" and the server already knew it was coming and took the bill away even before it hit the table.   This place has got a lot of work.  The area is a deadzone anyway, with failing rasputin and closing mervyn's.  I would expect the servers to know their customer's order, and know how to at least check on their customers.  This guy did not and i found myself flagging out other people's servers to check up on whats goin on.  This place pales in comparison to other chains and is not worth the hype by far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1020

Noky C.,"Fremont, CA",47,81,1,3.0,11/13/2008,"BJ's is all about compromise. I came here around 5pm on a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy. Took a seat at the bar and ordered a 4 beer sampler ($5.75); all of which were quite disappointing. Pumpkin Ale- watery and bland with a faint aftertaste of canned pumpkin Nutty Brunette- tastes like a slightly skunked New Castle PM Porter- watered down Guinness with no carbonation; literally like half Guinness, half water Tanaka Stout- undrinkable; I'd imagine this is what shoe polish would taste like While I tried to consume these barely drinkable beers, I ordered Angus Sliders since it was still happy hour and appetizers are $2 off (half off mini pizzas and $1 off pints). The sliders were excellent; like miniature In-N-Out burgers (I'm a sucker for all things in miniature). I upgraded my 4 beer sampler to a 7 beer sampler ($9.50) so I can finish off my mini burgers. The results were the same; disappointing beer. Brewhouse Blonde- imagine Bud Light with a faint nutty aftertaste Jeremiah Red- New Castle with a kick (7.3% alcohol) Harvest Hefe- imagine watery, over-carbonated Widmer's hefe I recommend sitting at the bar. Big screen tv to keep you occupied, quick service, free samples, and best of all, no pushy waitress rushing you through your beer / food. Their in-house beers were disappointing, but they carry a vast amount of other beers (draft and bottled craft brews). All of which are reasonably priced from $4-$6 a pint. Combined with a large selection of food and big screen tv, this place is a great hang out.  To sum up this long drawn-out review, keep it simple. Sit at the bar, order a pint of Guinness (or other outsourced brews) and some appetizers. For heartier food, stick with burgers and pizzas. Great place to hang out since they have a large selection of food and beverages; hence the 3 stars. It's a compromise.   ----- More on food: -deep dish pizzas are far too doughy. Thick mushy-soggy bread with toppings; some liked it, I didn't. Go with the thin crust pizza's from the appetizer section. -giant baked potatoes are just that; HUGE!! Looks tasty and filling with all the toppings, but I'd be in a carb-induced coma if I finished one.  -spinach dip appetizer was disappointing; think grocery store jar of spinach dip and a pile of stale tortilla chips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1020

I love their beer - probably because it's so sweet. They have a little known option of 'mixing' the beers.. my favorite is the PM Porter with the Berry Burst Cider. They float the porter on top of the cider so the glass looks so pretty!!! Their food is pretty good. Really good pizzas and burgers, fair appetizers - overall just good straight up bar food. Of course, there are the pazookie's, which are the reason I fell in love with BJ's to begin with. Warm gooey cookie topped with melty ice cream... how could you go wrong?!?

Whiners say...

Not only is the pizza awesome, I LOVE the beer samplers.  It's way better than the ones they serve at Rock bottom.  At Rock Bottom, you get these tiny little shot glasses.  At BJ's the beer sampler glasses are much taller.  YAY.  This place sure beats happy hour at hooters with their nasty salty wings.  A nice buzz after work the best guilty pleasure pizza in town 5 min drive from home My only complaint is the long wait to get a table.  It's a 2 hour wait on a friday night!  crazzyyy.... I just ended up getting my drinks and food at the bar.  The bartenders were super friendly and the food and drinks came out fast, maybe because we were sitting in front of them.

J. C.,"Fremont, CA",123,20,7,4.0,11/24/2008,"I loved the BJs in Cupertino.  This BJs is... pretty much the same thing. And now that BJs is here, I can confidently say BJs has the second best pizza in the Fremont/Newark area.  The number one would be Mission Pizza. But BJ's deep dish pizza is a very close second and its atmosphere is superior to Mission Pizza's (big TVs, sports, brewery included, and rowdy young crowd.)   As for the pizza, the crunch and bread in that deep dish is certainly a guilty pleasure and probably very fattening.  But man, what else do you expect?  Wash it down with a pint of their seasonal brew! Of course, having TWO HAPPY HOURS in one day is awesome.  They have a happy hour from 5-7pm on weekdays and another one from 10pm to closing on Sunday-Thursday.  Go then, and the quality-to-price ratio totally fits the bill and is well worth it. Watch out for the crowds though!  For a shorter wait, try to grab a seat at the bar on front of the mega-screen and enjoy the rowdy atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1020

O-M-G-W-T-F.  one plus, i tried the pumpkin ale - which i actually liked, very light with a hint of pumpkin - i'd recommend trying it.  my potato was also.. luke-warm, although very tasty and HUGE - i could only eat half.   hopefully this place gets its act together. the food is pretty decent - the service is lousy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1020

Brewpubs should have better beer than this.  I am surprised that somebody has finally made a microbrew that tastes like a macrobrew.  The Red, Brown Ale and Porter could have been excellent (nice malts) if the beers weren't watered down. Pizza was in a deep-dish style was was pretty good.  Not because it was good deep dish, but the flavor combinations were adventurous and well put together.  Service was so-so at best.

They are usually busy for dinner so there was a bit of a wait, but that's to be expected at most places on a weekend night. We got seated and got a wonderful waiter who made sure we were kept happy and well fed. He talked over beer suggestions with my boyfriend and helped him decide on one that would go well with his meal.  I got the shrimp tacos and they were really good. I also ordered a side salad with the creamy garlic dressing that has now become a favorite of mine. We ordered potato skins and they were the standard fair, nothing special, but good. We had the kidlet with us and she dropped part of her grilled cheese on the floor and they promptly offered to replace it.  Other waiters/waitresses offered to refill our drinks if they saw they were low and everyone was nice to us. All is all a great experience and above standard customer service. We have gone back a couple times and every time this has been our experience. They have plenty of big screens so you can watch the game and a decent selection of beers to try as well as draft root beer, cream soda, and black cherry soda.  The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because while the food is good, it is standard chain restaurant fair. Good food, I'll eat it again, but not one of those meals that makes you want to run and tell all your friends. I would most definitely recommend this place to people looking for a nice meal in a decent place. The atmosphere is high scale sports bar. Little bit of fun, but a definitely above the average  decor at a chain restaurant.  They have call ahead seating and I highly recommend using it.

I really wouldn't expect that type of treatment from a chain restaurant.  Our server was absolutely horrible and the only thing giving this review 2 stars is the decent food. First one into the restaurant and last one out, WHY? because our server didn't want to put in our order till all in our parties, though we insisted her to fire it up, had arrived and were ready. But how would the others in our party order if they didn't get the chance to see the menu? I'm pretty sure she was on something because she needed us to repeat ourselves twice on everything.  We saw the food runner/other server WAY MORE often than her.  And to top it all off, her way of getting us out was..""Is this(the check) ready? I have to go home."" We would've been long gone if you had first given us our food 30 minutes earlier on in the visit!  If you ever get the chance to choose your server, stay away from her. I'm assuming she works day time only, blonde curly hair, and looks sort of old.  It seems service is just lacking here after looking at other reviews.

Loren John B.,"Beaverton, OR",137,424,177,3.0,11/30/2008,"So I came into town earlier this weekend to find out this place just opened up recently. I thought this place would take over where the Circuit City or Rasputins used to be. Nope. Its smack dab in the middle of the parking lot. I didn't realize all the cars there were meant for BJ's customers. And the dining area is probably the smallest among the other BJ's I've been to. Yikes. My friend told me that all the other BJs in the Bay (i.e. Foster City and San Jose) that they don't allow you to phone in for reservations, but apparently this place did. Ugh. We needed a table for a party of 8, and the wait would be an hour and a half tops. Double ugh. Mind you this was at 7pm, so since its new I guess it makes sense. I showed up with one of my friends a little early and we chilled at the bar. Fortunately, one big party left their table and we swooped in right away. For the record its open seating at the bar, so we lucked out.  Service was extra slow and they got our order wrong... in a good way. One of my buddies ordered the Santa Fe spring rolls and never got it. We asked for waters for everyone and that took half an hour. Our shots of Patron for the entire table took awhile too. If it wasn't for being surrounded by good company, we would have complained more haha. As far as getting out order wrong, we ordered 2 large pizzas, the BJ's favorite (my personal fave) and the Great White. Our pizzas came out to one small and one medium pizza, so instead of getting 8 slices per large pizza, we got 10 pieces with the two smaller pizzas of each flavor. Woot.  I'm glad there's a BJ's much closer to my home without having to drive all the way to deep San Jose or across the bridge to Foster City. I haven't had it in awhile so it was nice. I'm just not fond of it being smaller than the other BJ's I've been to and the service needs some work too. They also need to revitalize the rest of that shopping center, especially now that the new Mervyn's is closing. I'll review this again if I end up coming back at a later time. And now i just realized that none of us ordered pizookies. Oh well. Cheerio.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1060

I would suggest getting a reservation at least a week in advanced if you want to eat here without waiting 45+ minutes.  It is packed at almost all hours of the day, except if you come in during the weird times like 4-5 in the evening.  I think the waiters and waitresses have a lot of growing to do in their profession and I probably won't come back to this location for at least 6 months.  Maybe everyone will have their act down by then.  I think coming here for a quick drink would be everyone's best bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1060

I then got in my car and drove back to the restaurant to see if they had my card. When I got there I asked to speak with a manager and expressed my frustration with the host. The manager did not apologize and just told me that the situation was ""weird"". I am very unimpressed with how I was treated and will NEVER come back to this establishment.

And the waiter/waitress has never cared - ""oh you didn't order this? are you sure?"" SERIOUSLY? We've had our entrees come out before the salads - we actually had to remind the waiter TWICE about our missing salads - first when he brought the entrees, and again while we were ordering dessert - didn't see him at all between that, we ended up walking up to the bar to replenish our drinks. I've been brought pizookies with cold cookies and half melted ice cream multiple times, and one night our check came with charges for things we didn't even order! Last night, we ordered drinks that the waiter had to come back and confirm THREE times - what the heck were you writing down?? I don't know why I have continued to give this place so many chances. After last night, I probably won't again. There are plenty of places that have better food, and I will just bake my own ""pizookie"" the next time I feel like having one.

When we were first seated, the booth was still dirty as there was a fork on the seat and a dirty napkin.  Next, there was no silverware set on the table which we had to ask for.  It took 10 minutes to get 2 beers and some water.  An order for sliders took 40 minutes to get out and by that time, most of us were done eating.  The server said he would come back to refill our drinks but never did so we had to ask another server.  The only thing I can give them props on was dropping off the pizookie before the ice cream melted.

Despite the crowded parking lot, we got seated in less than 10 minutes.  I have had their Great White deep dish pizza before at the Oakridge Mall location (and VERY impressed, best one around for miles (Pizza Chicago is the only one which exceeds), so I convinced my father to get BJ''s Favorite.  My mom got the Santa Fe salad.  I got a California Grilled Chicken sandwich.  To drink, I had a homemade Cream Soda (no corn syrup!) and wow, you can taste all the flavors to it.  Pops got the Taster, which gives you 5oz. portions of each of their 7 beers.  My favorite of their beers is the blonde, red, and brewnette (funny how my faves were the hair colored ones!). It's rare at times with my family but we all LOVED EVERYTHING!  My sandwich was filling, flavorful, and oh so cheesy!  And I liked how they have an option of the type of fries (wedges or crispy thin), those wedges were tasty.  I was even munching my mom's salad with her, since she was raving about it the whole time (she saw someone else having it at a table before we sat down, she asked what the lady ordered).  And that pizza filled and satisfied my finicky father; plus he had leftovers for tomorrow's Super Bowl Sunday. Then last but not least, we HAD to get a Pizookie!  All my friends from SoCal were raving about them to me so I had to give in.  We shared this new one, double chocolate cookie in the tin with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream on top, with a Ghiradelli square as garnish.  That was simply unforgettable... I highly recommend it to anyone and to even make room at the end of your meal for it (if you're a chocolate fan, like my family is). I have no complaints about the service, they seemed a bit busy at times, but that's because so many people were there!

Miko T.,"Fremont, CA",17,59,1,4.0,1/2/2009,"Tonight I visited the Newark BJ's for the first time. My prior experience was at the location in San Mateo (I think?), but it was for a large group, and all of the pizzas were pre-ordered, so my involvement was very limited.  This Newark location visit was mainly a good one. My boyfriend's parents actually got there before we (the boyfriend and I) did. They got there at 5:45 and were told that it was going to be a 30-35 minute wait. We arrived at 6:05 and they had just been seated, so the wait was less than expected, especially for a Friday night.  After getting seated and receiving waters all around, we ordered the BJ's Best (?), general appetizer plate. It had cheese sticks, avacado egg rolls, santa fe rolls (didn't try this), and spinach-artichoke dip. The spinach-artichoke dip was amazing and nice and warm, and served with tortilla chips. Cheese sticks were standard, and the avacado egg rolls were fine.  The main negative here was that it took a long time for drinks other than water and fountain soda to be brought to the table. It was like waiting for food, but it was just a drink. I mean, how long can it take, really?  I ordered fish and chips, with skinny fries. It was good, fresh, though the fries were not hot. In fact, they were a little too close to bla-room temperature. But the fish was definitely just out of the fryer. Boyfriend ordered pizza. The medium was pretty large, definitely a lot for just one person. He ate half of it, and took the rest home for leftovers. He ordered the BJ's favorite pizza (looked good). Salads that can be ordered with a meal are an additional $2.95. Be aware though, that as a side salad is pretty big. Probably served on a plate about 6 inches in diameter. I would skip on a side salad if you plan on ordering dessert.  For dessert we ordered a pazookie, I think the oreo one. The oreo part of it was this little cream on top, otherwise it was a chocolate cookie. So I had heard a lot of hype about this pazookie thing, and understood it as just a cookie with ice cream. However, the cookie is almost like a brownie, fresh out of the oven, and still has that doughy texture. Combined with the ice cream, it's way more than just a cookie, and DEFINITELY worth getting. So skip on salad and little extras, and save room for dessert. Other little tid bits...the noise in this place is pretty intense, and it's probably not the best place for nice quiet, intimate conversation. Another slight negative is that there are servers and then waiters for each table, so it's a bit confusing trying to get something. Because you can't ask the person who brings the beer for another drink--you'd have to ask your server for that. I just don't think that system is the most effective or convenient for either the guests or the employees. Prices are moderately fair, and the menu is extensive. Choices range from salads, potatoes, soup, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, pasta, and more.  Reservations are only accepted for groups of ten or more, and from what I've heard, the wait can be quite long, depending on when you go. I think we just got lucky tonight. Overall, good place. Would go again. Skip salad/sides/appetizers. Save room for dessert. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1120

Not enough arugula and the vegetables were barely cooked. It came after 45minutes.  What were they doing? I think they do their pizza best but the portions are so huge it's impossible to order.  The American burger came with toast instead of a bun.???

It is one of the better sports bar restaurants around. Their deep-dish pizza is pretty good, and is big enough to feed an army. Lots of choices of home-brewed beer, and best of all, the infamous Pizookie - ice cream over a large 6-inch baked cookie (chocolate chip, oreo, macadamia nut, etc.) The best deal at BJ's is the 2 for $20 value meal that they offer: 1 Medium Pizza (we got half Southwestern and half Sweet Pig aka Hawaiian), 2 small salads which were huge, and 1 Pizookie of our choice!

Laura G.,"Newark, CA",8,6,1,3.0,11/16/2008,"The first time I had BJ's was in Maui. It was so good we ate it three times in one week! So, when I saw there would be a new one in Newark, I was elated! Having worked in the industry during college, I knew the grand opening would be crazy and full of kinks. To avoid the madness, we decided to order take-out. You can actually order online, but I chose to call it in, just to be sure I got exactly what I wanted. I ordered a large sausage and cheese deep dish pizza (uncut, because it stays hotter). The girl on the phone answered right away and was very nice. She told me the order would take only 10 minutes. I thought to myself, ""What? A deep dish in 10 minutes?"" When I arrived, I thought I would be able to park in the ""take out"" parking. The policy is that if you do, they will come to you and bring our food. Well, that didn't happen. The parking lot is a mess and the ""take out"" spots were full. I had to circle three times before I found a parking spot. Grrr...hopefully this will change soon! Take out has its own entrance with a hostess at the front to greet you. The place inside is nice. It's about time Newark has something a little more hip than Swiss Park! When I arrived, I was helped right away and my pizza was ready and waiting. I opened the pizza to make sure the order was correct.  What I saw inside was nothing like the BJ's I remember in Maui. Having a husband from Chicago, I have become very particular about my pizza. Real Chicago pizza has thick dough, sauce, toppings and then the cheese on top. This pizza looked like doughy foccaccia with no sauce, a little cheese and then some sausage on top. (BJ's used to claim it was Chicago pizza...is it no more?) I immediately asked for extra sauce and was pleasantly accomadated. When I arrived home and opened it up for my husband, he turned up is nose. We wondered if it was microwaved or pre-made, as it was ready in only ten minutes????? Anywho, we were hungry, so we ate it. I dipped my bites in the extra sauce and it was actually fabulous! I guess that is the key! It's not as good as the pizza I had in paradise, but it certainly is one of the better ones in the local area.  I think we will do a dine in experience in a few weeks after they have a chance to get the kinks out. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1080

My mom, husband, and I wanted to watch the 49ers game this past Sunday, along with 3 other people. So there were 6 of us. I called to make a reservation for the bar, since we were a big party, I thought it'd be fine. The girl on the phone said she had a booth in the bar, 3rd row back reserved for us at 2:15. Cool. But we get there and the guy at the front says, ""Sorry, we don't do reservations. And the bar is open seating anyway."" I have worked in a fine-dining atmosphere for years, and I realize that this is just casual but all dining protocol says that this in itself warrants one free dessert. Furthermore, management didn't stand behind their employees, but rather blamed us, the diners, for not knowing that they don't make reservations. HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW?!? Then they screwed up my food order, forgot to put three of the six chairs and silverware sets at the table (so half of us were left standing for 10 minutes until we went and got our own chairs), and then forgot to put in our pizookie order but didn't realize it for HALF AN HOUR! The manager finally brought one out for us, didn't appologize, just ""there it is"". The only saving grace was the waitress that relieved our original, forgetful one. Rose, I think her name was. She was very polite up until we signed the check, then she didn't care who we were after when we asked for to-go boxes. Overall a terrible experience by front of house and management alike.

Judging from the review trends, my critique will possibly be the handful of 5 stars the Newark BJs will get. Well anyways I had a great experience coming here. This BJs has a unique set up which is different from the other BJs I went to, which were Foster City, and Tanforan. It has like a main floor which has easy access to view the the multi-sport screens at the bar, and the flat screens surrounding the floor. From where I was sitting it almost felt like a theater.  In attention to food, the pizza is awesome. I'm a pizza lover, and I have to say BJs pizza is my number one favorite as of now. I don't care what people say but BJs is better than Pizza Chicago. The dough has smooth consistency, the  pizza toppings are premium grade, and the crust is soft and crispy. Yum.  As for service, our waitress was friendly, and nice. She was attentive, and quick in responding to our requests. I think people should give new opening businesses a break. People have such high expectations for new businesses thinking they'll pamper them with 5 star treatment. It is like expecting the first generation iphone  to not have no defects when you clearly know that first systems launches always have some sort of problems.(terrible tangent) lol. But anyways chill guys, don't beat them down, but give the manager some feedback if there is such a big issue. (possibly they'll give you a free meal on next visit). I'm sure within a month or so the workers' service will be more efficient.   Yeah the parking was difficult to find considering that Mervyns is closing and having a blowout sale during the holiday season, but the chaos should be expected. Wait till Mervyns closes, then parking will be no problem.  I recommend this particular BJs location, but it should be noted that any BJs restaurants has great food.

RJ A.,"Hayward, CA",296,45,9,3.0,1/8/2011,"This place is alright. Very sports bar orientated. They have a lot of televisions so practically every sport is playing.The restaurant is pretty big very spacious. SO yeah this place is a brewery so they have a lot of different types of beer. The one I had recently that was pretty good I believe it was called Jeremiah Red. Got pretty buzzed after two pints of it but I also didn't eat yet. The food is pretty good and they are more known for their specialty pizzas. The one I enjoyed is called the Great white which has a mushrooms, chicken, tomatoes and garlic and instead of tomato sauce they use an Alfredo sauce that is really good and a worth a try if it's your first time there. Finally on the menu for dessert it's a definite must try is their pizooki which is icecream served over a warm cookie.It tastes ever so good. The only problem with this place is the service.It isn't that it's their fault. It's can just be really busy and most of the time it is. So the waiters and waitress are running around everywhere.

Tito R.,"Mountain View, CA",0,9,,3.0,5/12/2009,"I usually avoid chain type restaurants in the Fremont area due to the epidemic of poor servers these places tend to be plagued with & elbow to elbow crowd of locals that all seem to look & act the same. WTF is it with Fremont? Anyhow, I have to admit I went into this BJ's quite skeptical & expecting the usual crappy Fremont experience. Well I was pleasantly surprised to the contrary here. Not too bad. I've been twice & both times I left pleased with the experience & a very full belly (oh yeah, good buzz too, hehehe...). The place is big, clean & bustling with business - which translates to everyone in the area is trying eat here right how. Let me say the wait was very long, I'm sure it was because we went on a busy nite (Friday) and I guess it isn't necessarily there fault if everyone & there mama wants to eat here right now. But what i didn't like is they didn't let us make reservations over the phone so we had to show up & wait (party of 4). It was so packed there weren't even enough of those pager things, we had to check back 20 mins later to get one. It was about an hour wait, but this was offset by hanging out at the bar which wasn't that bad, though there was no space so you are kind of stuck standing in the middle of the floor holding your brew & dodging the waiters going in & out of the kitchen. The bartender was your typical Fremont'y 20-something bartender, but luckily I didn't get the bad attitude I'm accustomed to at these type of places. For being so busy he took care of us in a timely manner, offered refills & I tipped accordingly. The beer was good, BJ's house brews are a beer drinkers delight, I stick with the Blonde. After we finally got seated our server came pretty quick to ask if we wanted anything to drink & I am happy to say she had a great personality. BJ's scored points here with me, she genuinely seemed committed to making sure we were enjoying our evening there. I wish I remembered her name to give her a shout out! BJ's must actually interview there applicants & gauge there customer service ability - THANK YOU . Our group ordered a deep dish pizza (warning: the pizza will knock you the eff out. Its good & BIG!). Nachos, wow these are good too. They did not suck at all, we actually ran out of chips for dipping in the left over salsa & our waitress was KIND enough to bring us an extra serving of plain nacho chips to clean the plate with! I had a chicken sandwich & man it was GOOD. Big portions, we had to take a lot of stuff home! No complaints with the food or servers here ! For being in Fremont & a chain brewery/food type place this place is not bad at all. Go with some friends / family & I think you will have a good time with some good food & drink. I hope they can maintain this level, its not the best I've been too but it's good enough that I will definitely go back. Fremont is notorious for bad making places like this go bad fast.

So I used to think the only place I could get some good tasting clam chowder is at pier 39 in SF, but now I don't have to go that far to satisfy my clam chowder cravings anymore. If you're going to get clam chowder at BJ's, get it with the bread bowl, it makes all the diference in the world! The bread bowl is toasted to perfection and they flavored the lid of the bowl with butter, some herbs, and cheese and OMG that hits the spot! The clam chowder tastes great; has enough clams and potatos, and goes very well with the bread bowl. Lastly, the pizookie, what a great invention. My favorite is the cookies and cream and my second favorite is the white chocolate macademia. The cookie is chewy, but not soft.

I obliged and walked over, ID in hand. The stupid bitch of a bartender says snootily ""we need the real ID, not the fake one."" She followed the comment with what can only be described as a half-assed, watered down witch cackle. I was taken aback, and responded with an ""oh.""

Alicia K.,"Alameda, CA",12,52,2,1.0,1/5/2009,"BJ'S IN FREMONT BLOWS!! I used to frequent BJ's while living in Los Angeles County and it was my favorite cheap eat with good beer, decent service, and tons of sports on many TV's.  My best friend and I were on our way to Red Robin yesterday and saw BJ's in Fremont and were excited to go there instead...to our dismay.  There was ONE game playing on ALL screens??? Ok, whatever, it was the football game but I'd rather see a variety of sports.   Our experience at the Fremont location was so horrible I'm tempted to stand in the parking lot and warn customers before getting to the door.  I don't expect much from a joint like this so to taking time to write a long review on a brewery... tells you just how bad it is!   We sat in the bar at a six top and there were tons of open seats in the bar and throughout the entire restaurant.  We sat and watched over 10 (yes I was counting) employees cruise right by us, talk at the terminals, chat at the kitchen entry doors for 15 minutes until we were finally rudely greeted with menus that were tossed in front of us.   10 minutes after that our server returned and said, ""Can I get you something to drink?""  After 25 minutes you can get us a lot more than something to drink...you should've at least brought out some water.  We were very polite though so she had no clue we were frustrated.  We placed our order and we were splitting two entrees so the waitress suggested a particular burger they're known for...so I ordered it.  We ordered rasberry lambic's and the server didn't know what we were talking about at all?? They have a total of 3 ciders on the menu...you'd think they'd know 'em...guess not.  After she continued speaking it was obvious that she's not the sharpest tool in the shed...lol.   Our salads were brought out in about 10 minutes (35 minutes seated and still no water, no drinks, no silverware) and I sware to you...they tasted like dirt...they were just regular side salads but I don't know if the lettuce wasn't washed or what but it was gross not to mention that the bleu cheese dressing was so runny it ran right off of the dirty lettuce and carrots. So we were quick to put those aside with our fork and napkins left in them.  Then our drinks were FINALLY brought out without water...after food had been served...after sitting without silverware and salads in front of us.  The salad plates sat on our table in front of us until the end.   Then our food was brought out.  The best employee was the food runner...she was 10x's better than our server...hell, she was our server...we wanted to tip her alone...hahaha.  The menu item that the ding bat waitress suggested and that I ordered is not what I received.  I guess her stupid self decided to order something else?????  We asked for water but never got any, we saw our server go to every table around us and I would have liked to send back whatever it is that I got but no one ever came around to do so.  I ate the 1/2 of my friends meal and left my plate sitting hoping to tell our server.  She never came.  We went to the bar to replenish our drinks since the server was no where to be found and when we ordered rasberry lambic's, the EXACT same thing we just ordered and that is on TAP, the bartender didn't know what we were talking about...we had to point it out to him...WOW!!  Are you kidding me?  He also didn't know how to transfer the ticket to our table which was dead center of the bar.   The server finally came around and we asked for the check.  She left the four dirty plates and six glasses on the table and had the check back to us in 10 seconds....dead serious.  We didn't see her the entire meal but back in 10 seconds with our check.  The fastest service we received was our check to get us out of there...what a welcoming warm feeling...hahaha.   Remember on pretty woman when Julia Roberts goes back the boutique and asks the saleswoman, ""Do you work on commission?....BIG MISTAKE!"" hahaha...that's what I felt like telling her.  My best friend and I are HUGE tippers as we appreciate the fact that serving is hard work and they work for tips as they make minimum wage.  My best friend asked for the check and the check was set in front of me.  I immediately handed it to my friend in front of the waitress and she placed her credit card and gave it back.  She processed the credit card in under one minute and again placed it in front of me...wtf!!??   I wrote a lengthy comment on the back of the credit card receipt and we left her $1.51 as an insult...hahaha...I can't remember the last time we did that....it's been a long time and we eat out a lot and although we've had bad service this extreme combination of customer abuse was unacceptable!! It's sad really because I really liked BJ's and we were so excited seeing one close by...oh well...all I can say is DO NOT GO TO THE FREMONT LOCATION!  No one should have to pay for that type of utter disregard in a service oriented business...WOW!

Joe Y.,"Livermore, CA",93,225,4,2.0,11/13/2008,"The latest of this national chain (of what I call the Applebees of Brewery restaurants) opened in Newark recently. The food is what is to be expected. Burgers, chicken sandwiches, pasta, salads, make your own topping pizzas, and fish tacos. I had the SPECIALTY CALZONE: BJ's classic pizza dough stuffed with a rich, creamy mixture of spinach and artichoke hearts, cream cheese and mozzarella. Oven-baked and topped with a bruschetta medley. I've had better at Pizza Hut for half the price. What I really came to try was the beer. I'm a beer snob. I had BJ'S Jeremiah Red:  An Irish-style red ale with the full-bodied richness of an English old ale. Brewed with a secret blend of five imported specialty malts. Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma. It is an excellent example of a mass produced brewery red. Hard to find this style of beer available year round in small micro-breweries. I also tried the IPA, but have had much better at the local brewery in Fremont.  All in all, I thought the service was acceptable, bartenders actually could pour beer, and the atmosphere was typical of their other locations.

Jennifer H.,"San Jose, CA",25,54,6,4.0,10/8/2009,"Yes, this IS a chain but it's my favorite chain. I typically go to 2 different locations.  This is one of them but I'll review both locations on this post. Despite how many times my high school friends and I have been here, we still come back for the following reasons: 1. Even though the wait takes a long time, we can always chill at the bar.   2. The atmosphere is great. 3. One time we happened to catch happy hour during the FInal Four.  Mini pizzas are only $5 and some drinks half off. 4. I really like their pizzas. 5. The other food is good too. 6. I never had bad service no matter which location. 7. My boyfriend and I don't have ESPN so we've been going to BJs to watch MNF.  TVs on every corner and wall. 8. MNF is awesome there because everyone is into the game and it just adds to the atmosphere. (Plus, I believe MNF is during happy hour). 9. The beers are really good.  My favorite is the Jeramiah Red (sp?)  There must be something in the beer because everytime I come, I get buzzed pretty quick (like after 1/2).  It's a great feeling.  The other drinks are really tasty too. 10.

Now I'll have to try this place again to see if they can keep up the good work or slide back to mediocre. Our table had a appetizer combo, next time I'll just get the avocado rolls. We learned that the only difference between the lunch/dinner items was the price and not the quantity of food. I had the fish tacos, one fish, one shrimp. Next time just the fish...the shrimp wasn't very good. Hubby ordered the sliders, he was happy with them. Mom and Uncle had the unlimited soup/salad combo and liked the tomato and minestrone soups.

Alvin W.,"Fremont, CA",221,328,87,4.0,5/4/2009,"I've been here on three occasions and now I can compare the service and quality of food.  The quality of the food is always fresh and consistent, although due to the slow service, the hot food turns into warm food, or the cold food (aka salad) turns into warm food. Visit #1 - friend and I both ordered a wedge salad and an entrée.  My salad came out but her's was no where in sight.  So far in sight that her giant veggie baked potato and my chicken cobb sandwich arrived to the table.  We had to remind the server about her salad, and waited another few minutes for it.  Slightly irritated, she didn't hold it against them because after we placed our order with our server, he went to break and another server took over.  The veggie baked potato was pretty good and my chicken cobb sandwich hit the spot. Visit #2 - found an online coupon for $5 off so came here again.  Like the first visit, after our server (different from my first visit) took our order, she went on break and another server took over.  Service was pretty good.  She was attentive and friendly.  We did an order of avocado egg rolls, bbq beef sandwich, and I got their soup & salad combo.  The avocado egg rolls are darn tasty with that sweet sauce.  The bbq beef sandwich was sliced into thin slices so the flavor really came out.  The Caesar salad was crisp and fresh, and the Tuscan tomato bisque was a bit oily but flavorful and spicy.  Visit #2 was better than visit #1. Visit #3 - came here with the extended family to do an early mother's day.  We made reservations for 14 at 6pm.  Upon reaching our table, it was only set up for 12.  The server was a bit irritated with the hostess and scolded her to check on the table BEFORE seating guests.  LOL, I'm thinking this server knows what's going on!  So after we get additional seats and get situated, our server takes our drink order, brings the drinks and then tells us she's going on break.  WTF, it's it my luck that each time I come here my server takes break and someone else takes over?  The service was as good as can be considering our party was a group of 14.  I know she had to serve other tables but service was slow this time around.  I have a feeling that some of our food sat at the counter before we got it as multiple people ordered the same thing; i.e. two people ordered soup.  One was warm, the second one was forgotten and when it came, it was piping hot.  Same scenario with hot water for tea, and soft drink refills took about 10 minutes.  In all fairness, I can relate to a large party and also serving other tables, the restaurant was crowded. Over all, I'd give this place 3.5 stars but I'll round up.  Service does need to improve in order for me to give them a legit 4 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1220

The food was pretty good (I got the salmon teriyaki with rice) and the ambience was nice for a group hangout (dim, loud but not to the point where you have to yell).

Carol P.,"Fremont, CA",2,17,,3.0,11/16/2008,"It has only been a week or so since it opened, and I'm willing to give it time to work out the service issues. If that improves, and it almost can't help but do so, then it will get more stars.  Friends and I had lunch there on Thursday, and it wasn't bad. In fact, service was pretty good for the most part. We split the avocado eggrolls, which were excellent. My friend had the fettucchine alfredo (I seem to recall) and she said it was quite enjoyable. I ordered fish tacos. We both had wine, and their selection is acceptable, if not outstanding. Then we took family out for dinner tonite. There were 8 of us, including three children. BJ's doesn't accept reservations, but you can call in and they will put your name down. Nonetheless, it can be trying to wait for what they said would be at least an hour. It turns out we only had to wait for 45 minutes total, not too terrible for a brand new restaurant. As it was before, the food is pretty good. It is bar food, sandwiches, pastas, burgers and the like. All three of the young ones had spagetti with marinara sauce from the children's menu and it seemed acceptable. Adults had jambalaya, fish tacos, strip steak with potato, and chopped salad, as well as a Tuscan pasta dish. Jambalaya was pretty good, and so were the fish tacos. The steak was good, etc. Kids had the children's sundaes, and they looked wonderful, even to the adults. We all split the brownie with whipped cream and I think ice cream - yummy, but huge. Even with five adults, it was a bit much. All in all the food is quitte good for what it is. Service, however, really needs a tweak. The servers were all very friendly and apologetic when they brought a chopped salad that was supposed to be with out the meat .. and wasn't. I had to wait quite a while for my first glass of wine - probably 30 minutes all told. In all, it took more than an hour and a half to get through the meal. I think it will get better; it not, they will have a problem. Parking is abysmal,but again, once the parking lot is finished and Mervyn's is gone, that shouldn't be an issue. We will be back, but we're giving it a couple of weeks. It is nice having a big, well designed and attractive restaurant in Newark.

I have been to other BJ's before and this was my 2nd visit to this particular location. I love the ambience and the décor of this place; It has a very casual yet elegant feel to it. The only thing I hate is the long wait, many times we've decided to go to another place since the wait here was over 1.5 hours. I guess everyone in Fremont knows how good this place is.... We've tried some beers here and all of them were good. This time I got the berry cider beer which is more of a cider than a beer and it was good.  At our table we got the:  Avocado rolls which was amazing Grilled chicken salad - which is topped with awesome onion rings Tomato soup - which had the freshest ingredients, it was a little too creamy for me but it tasted really good... Grilled chicken sandwich - came with the crispiest fries Mediterranean pizza- which was very good I think our waitress was either new or was helping too many tables at one time. She kept forgetting our drinks, silverware etc.  My friend asked for the Grilled Chicken sandwich with soup and not fries but when he got it, it had fries. When he asked them about it, they happily got him a bowl of soup and let him have the fries too.  I ordered the Mediterranean pizza and since I was going to share it, I asked for the chicken on one half and no meat on the other (I am a vegetarian), but when it came to us, it had chicken all over. My husband had already put a slice with the chicken on his plate and started eating it. When I asked the waitress about it, she called in the guy from the kitchen and he took it back to have it fixed.  I suspected they would just pick the chicken and bring out the rest , but no... they were baking another pizza.  The manager came to us and apologized for the mix up, it was no big deal as we were having a good time with friends and there was other food on our table. She offered to get me some soup till I waited, which I thought was very nice of her. Then came my pizza the way I wanted it...it tasted awesome. The manager went one step ahead and took the pizza off our bill as it took a long time to get it done right. I thought this was super nice; they really didn't have to do that.

Thursday, July 29th my daughter and 4 teens (grandkids) and I arrived at 6:40pm. We asked for a table for 6 and the hostess told us it would be 30 - 45 minutes. We decided to wait. After the 30 - 45 mintues had passed, we would see parties of 5 or less be seated. most of these were groups that came in way after we arrived. We asked the hostess what was going on. She told us that they were waiting for a table of 6 that had already been there for 2 hours to leave so we can have their table. I asked is that the only place you can sit us? She could not answer. I watched her go to her manager and he did not offer her any suggestions or did he try and come over to explain, apologize, nothing. They just let us continue to sit. Finally 1 1/2 hours had gone by and another party of 5 was seated after only being there for 10 minutes waiting. I asked the hostess what was being done to get us seated, she replied they were still waiting for those people to leave. I asked if she was telling me that they couldn't accomendate parties of 6 or more? Once again no answer. I suggested putting table together or bringing a chair up to the booth. The manager came over and said the table where the other party of 6 was seating was their only option. They could not push tables together or add chairs to booths. I told him we had now gone over 1 1/2 hours of waiting and the other party had now been there for 3 hours. His response was only, ""well thank you for waiting all this time"". He could care less.

Marcus W.,"Union City, CA",0,21,,2.0,3/14/2009,"I sat down and saw the tab for the people who had the table before us.  They had left a 10% tip.  Sure, the food is good and it came out quickly, but is it anything you can't get from Amicis, Giorgio's, Claim Jumper, or Elephant Bar?  On a busy night, you gotta ask yourself if it's really worth the wait for pizza, beer, and other items on the menu for the waiting time (40 mins) and the frustrating service?  You won't get any service unless it's your assigned waiter/waitress.  I waved to one who was just standing 5 feet away not doing anything and was totally ignored.  I had to put my arm in the way of another to stop them.  We had to ask for utensils after the food started to arrive.  I didn't have much confidence in the waitress afterward and had to prompt them for the things you automatically get from other places.  Things like soda refills, ketchup, pepper/cheese for the pizza, and even the check had to be asked for.  It's the only business left standing in the whole block, so if you see that the parking lot is pretty full, a better experience awaits elsewhere.  It'll be better when the bloom wears off this place and they can weed out all the bad waiters/waitresses.  In the end I also left a 10% tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1280

greg n.,"Fremont, CA",6,3,,2.0,6/16/2009,"Came in here this past weekend for lunch. We were trying to decide on where to eat and this place has consistently been reliable. Not today. Wasn't too busy for a Sunday and was seated within 15 minutes. Our waitress was friendly and helpful as usual. We ordered the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps for an appetizer, the spaghetti with meat sauce and the pot roast dinner with a cup of clam chowder. After waiting about close to 30 minutes our appetizer came out, followed immediately by our main dishes. The appetizer was brought out by our waitress and our main dishes followed not even 1 minute later, served to us by someone different. Our waitress noticed what had happened and apologized and offered to take the main dishes back while we worked on our lettuce wraps, but I declined because I did not want the food getting cold. So we just ate everything at once. I also informed her that my soup never came out, which she apologized for and offered to take it off the bill. What pissed me off was when I looked at my pot roast. I have had this numerous times in the past and have always been satisfied with its generous portion size, not today. My plate had maybe 7 small pieces of meat with the gravy being nearly nonexistent. No broccoli with my veggies, just all carrots with a huge onion cut in half. At first I thought, ""Is this a lunch portion?"" So I finished my food but was annoyed the whole time I was eating because I was looking forward to a hearty meal only to find a kid size serving. They tried dressing my plate up all fancy but this isn't Manresa or some other classy restaurant, it's freaking BJ's! When our waitress returned she asked how the food was and I asked her if the pot roast was a lunch portion because it was so small. She said there is no lunch portion for the pot roast and babbled on with some reason which I tuned out cause I was pissed I was paying 14 bucks for a dish that wasn't even worth half of that. So all in all, if this is the turn they are taking where they down size the food while keeping the prices the same, I won't be coming back, to this location at least.

Mike M.,"Santa Clara, CA",25,271,20,4.0,12/7/2009,"Been wanting to check out this place since they opened a year ago at this location.  First off, the place is huge.  The dining area is expansive, same goes for the bar, and they've even got a special dining area sectioned off for private parties.  The atmosphere is similar to Cheesecake Factory.  I've heard that waiting lines can get long during peak times, but when we came here on a Sat for lunch, we were sat down immediately.  The food is above average.  We ordered a half-and-half deep dish pizza, the classic and the mediteranean.  It does the job if you're craving deep dish but Zachary's Pizza in Berkeley/Danville is still my fav spot for deep dish.  We had the white chocolate macadamia pizookie for dessert which was a nice treat, a little over the top but a nice treat once in awhile.  Anyhow, prices were reasonable, service was good, parking outside is easy, and an upbeat atmosphere.  Another plus for all the flat screens which is great for catching games.

Alan O.,"Fremont, CA",23,26,,2.0,4/7/2010,"The visit could have been much better. Reason- great lack of energy on the serving staff's part. There had to be at least 6-7 on the wait staff including a manager( from what was seen). We had a birthday that evening and only one person sang from the staff. To me that shows a lack of effort on making a customer feel invited. The food was decent and came to our table at a reasonable pace. Our server was helpful and she served us well, however, the lack of energy from the rest of the staff needs improvement. She even asked the manager to sing along and no comply.  This is a place where you can just count on having it as Take-out orders rather than spending your time in there.  Another Yelper commented on this being like the Fremont's Elephant Bar- in some ways it is- but the staff at the Elephant Bar treats the customers a little bit better- Remember a good business validates their customers.

christine c.,"Pacifica, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/2/2012,"This was one of my first trips to this BJ's in newark (I have been to the San Bruno and Foster City locations and they were far better).  We had a large party of 12 on a Saturday night, but we had made reservations prior....so the restaurant knew we had a large party....yet for some reason it seemed like they were not prepared.  We arrived at 4:30pm and were told that we had to finish our meals by 6:30pm.  Which we all thought would not be a problem.  However, it took our waitress 45 MINUTES to BRING WATER to our table and to top it off waters, sodas, and drinks were not refilled unless WE ASKED her for them.  3 pizzas were ordered and came out COLD, a steak was ordered medium but came out burned and well done, the manager offered to replace one of our pizzas since it had been cold when it reached the table.  It was a combo pizza, however, the pizza that came out to replace it was not a combo.  In return the manager had given us the steak free and offered a pizookie plattechrr.  The lackluster waitress didn't bring a menu or explain what the pizookie was, so many of the people at the table who had never been to BJ's before had no clue what this waitress was offering us.  We walked out of there at almost 7pm, and the entire 2.5 hours our waitress was talking to her family, hugged a child, and was chitchatting with another waitress.  We observed a waitress who kept touching her hair, putting pens in her mouth, and never washing her hands when she came around to pick up plates or serve.  Sadly, the manager tried to save our waitresses sinking ship (who stated over and over again it's not my fault the kitchen doesn't know how to follow instructions, and I am just the messenger), however, her lack of customer service skills, telling us her life story (I work 2 jobs and have a daughter)...we really don't care....bring us our water and food we ordered and be friendly.  I can say that all the food runners and busboys were working over time, probably to accommodate for the crappy wait staff.  Wish our forced 18% tip could have solely gone to the bus/servers.  I have NEVER had such a bad experience at a BJ's restaurant ever, and will NOT return to the Newark location nor will I recommend this location to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1260

Amazing must be a pretty ordinary word in his dictionary because the pastas that we had ordered were so much stuck in the ""eh"" section that it did not even catch sight of the amazing mark. We ordered two things here, the Angel Hair Toscana and the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta (the ladder is MUCH better). The only thing that actually made the meal really enjoyable was how nice the waitress, a skinny and tall caucasian woman, was and how many televisions there were posted around the room.

(ha!) i place an order and it says show up 30 minutes later. i show up. she goes over the order and OOPS she didn't enter an item. meaning i have to wait 15 minutes more while they whip it up (a flatbread pizza). lesson learned: online ordering doesn't actually put in an order -- they have to re-type it into their computer systems. turns out at the end we weren't waiting for this flatbread pizza but the lettuce wraps (which were correctly ordered the first time). and then she brings out the food, all done. at which point i notice shrimp on the lettuce wraps. the bf does not eat seafood. me: ""uhh, what is this?"" her: ""it's the thai shrimp lettuce wraps"" me: ""umm, we ordered chicken lettuce wraps"" (reading it directly off my receipt) her: ""uhh, we don't have chicken, just thai shrimp"" she pulls out a menu and points to it. i point to the item directly above. another 15 minute wait while they rush out the chicken wraps. i was offered a sundae for my troubles but turned it down because the bf is lactose intolerant. i suggest maybe a pizookie cookie without ice cream, but she goes in and checks and the manager denies her. (and yet somehow she can offer a full-on sundae?). our consolation prize? two cups of strawberry lemonade. gee thanks. on the upside, i now have thai shrimp lettuce wraps for tomorrow's lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1140
Danny R.,"Fremont, CA",3,39,,2.0,6/1/2009,"The food is good but the service blows. I've been to the fremont location about 10 or so times and while nobody has ever been out right rude to me, however the staff is very inattentive. The main thing that I notice every time i go here is that I have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes before I'm seated, then i'm seated around empty tables? If there are so many empty tables, why did I have to wait half an hour? I dont know what the logic or methodology with their seating approach but it sucks. Luckily they have good beer on tap to mellow me out and stop me from asking ""why the hell was I waiting for 20 minutes?"" over and over. This seating scenario has happened to me on 3 different occasions, i dont get it? ALSO; the menu's are always sticky. WTF? who hands out sticky menu's? How about instead of having the host/hostess up front staring at the wall you have him/her sponge down some menu's? sheezzz.  Now once you get passed the crappy seating, the disinterested staff, and the sticky cola coated menu's; the food is good eats! The chili burger is slammin and the shoe string fries are a must have. I've gotten the Cobb salad here once before and it was HUGE! So if your feeling brave enough to drudge through the lame staff for a good burger and beer, BJ's is worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1140
Gus R.,"Fremont, CA",0,16,1,1.0,12/31/2011,"We have been here many times and have notice the service level has been dropping as time goes by.  The first few times we were here it was great, good food nice atmosphere and friendly people.  I always tip at least 20% so I usually get good service from repeat servers. I don't mind waiting a few minutes and neither does my family so I understand that it's a busy place.   On the second to last night we came here we ordered the same as usual.  Each person in my family has a different favorite dish.  The dishes came out differently and were lacking some ingredients as if they were trying to cut back and make the dish more profitable.  I understand that given the demand of the place and I asked if they were kind enough to include what was in the dishes before and that I knew that I  would have to pay more and didn't mind paying more.  The server kept trying to explain to me that it wasn't included anymore and I understood that the first second.  I kept trying to express that I didn't care that it would cost me more.  Next thing I know I have the manager in front of me with a bad attitude explaining that it wasn't included and that if I must have it they could give it to me to make me happy......!!!!.  I tried to stay calm and told them that it wasn't necessary and that we didn't need to have it. I still tipped well and try to not let it get to me.   I am a small business owner and I understand that owners don't necessarily control what their managers and employees do so I gave the place another chance.  When we got there the server from last time said something to the server we got this time and all of a sudden we were all getting carded for buying a bottle of wine.  Never happened before.  At that moment I knew that I wasn't welcomed and asked to talk to the manager this time.  The guy just laughed at me and said that if I wanted wine I had to be carded.  I said, thank you very much but I would rather go somewhere I can relax to have a nice dinner.  I know that Fremont is well known for bad restaurants but this place is the worst for me so far.  I had some great nights here before but they have taken their hospitality quality to a new low.  I understand that owners don't care much as long as the place is making money but this guys are just plane rude.  I would avoid this place at all costs if you are trying to have a good relaxing time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1140
David H.,"Fremont, CA",7,178,2,2.0,6/9/2010,"BJ's get's two stars only because they did a nice job with the decor. Otherwise this place is kind of the pits. A hour wait is standard and the food is mediocre at best (bland is the best decription... and I'm talking about blackened chicken breast). They do have a nice selection of home brews and extensive list of Belgian ales that actually impressed me. If you're not with a big group I'd recommend trying to catch a perch at the bar where the turnover seems quicker. Overall I think this place is best avoided, and instead explore the riches of the many food offerings of the area (particularly from Southern and Southeast Asian).

We ended up at the bar since we went there for the ""ambiance."" The bar has an open floor plan, with good lighting.  As for food, you should at least try one of their pizza's. Lip smackin' good. Crust is crispy on the bottom, yet the toppings are not overly dry. Right amount of crust, sauce, and toppings. The portion for a large pizza is enough for one person to share if needed. Goes great with the Hefeweizen beer they have on tap.

Tyler L.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,12,,2.0,5/27/2009,"Most corporate, franchises, and places like that have consistency in their food and service.  I give this place 2 stars for their consistency in food, and incosistency in the ladder.  A couple of friends and I drank at the bar and the bill was more or less a hundred, that's fine because it was expected.  We paid it with our card and left a twenty in cash for tip.  The waitress stops by and says that she's got a few more drinks to add onto the tab, I said go ahead, the card's right there.  She looks at the twenty and looks back at me and says it's more.  I mean, come on, you can't be serious.  You're going to nickle and dime a drunk person and then expect that person to pay extra tip when he already threw down 20% on the existing bill?  Go to the BJ's in Cupertino, and forget about this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-newark?start=1200

The bread it comes with just adds even more flavor to an already good thing :) The appetizers are bomb..good enough to eat as a meal. When youre not super hungry, the portions are just right.

Ada S.,"Milpitas, CA",6,47,28,1.0,10/29/2013,"Am I the only one who notice the difference in their pizzas?  I don't know what happened but the quality of their pizzas went down the drain. I remembered about 2-3 years ago that their pizzas are cheesier with a lot more toppings.  The first time I noticed the difference was about 2 years ago. I really thought they forgot to add pizza sauce and cheese because it was that dry!  It was replaced by the same tasting pizza so I thought the cook was probably different that night. I finally gave it another try last Friday only to be once again disappointed.  I had to ask for a pizza sauce on the side but that didn't help.  I'm not sure if this is the only location that serves the dry pizza but my best friend who also loved BJ's pizza at one point noticed the same thing from the Socal area where she lives. Their thai shrimp lettuce wrap was also not as good as I remembered it.  Our server was very friendly and energetic but his breath was really bad.  Oh, they tried twice to serve us pizzas that wasn't ours.  The first attempt was a female server who at least asked if the pizzas she was holding was our order and clearly it was not because I didn't see greens which should have been the bell peppers so I told her it was not our order.  Five minutes later, a male came with the same looking pizza but this time this server did not ask if it was our order. He just automatically tried to place the pizza on our table until I stopped him and said that was not our pizza because I don't see any veggies on it.
