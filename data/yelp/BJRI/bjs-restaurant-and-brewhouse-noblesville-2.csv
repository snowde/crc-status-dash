John T.,"Westfield, IN",0,15,6,4.0,8/6/2017,"First time here, had a very nice experience. Looked super busy, but we were seated right away!  Energetic server was polite and not over bearing. Quick service with the beers and they were good and cold!  We opted to have burgers, both of ours were cooked just how we wanted them. Portions were solid, drinks were great and service all around was exceptional!  Highly recommend, it's casual, nice atmosphere and we'll be back to grab something again and maybe watch some football on the numerous tv's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=20
Kenneth S.,"Fishers, IN",25,4,,1.0,10/23/2017,"The food is just ok but service is horrendous. Also, if you are going to offer curbside to go and your sign says until 9:00 pm but you tell me that because it's dark out you can't do it. By the way it's 7:20 pm. You guys really need to work on customer service. I also notice you seem to be a little understaffed since you can't answer a phone until it rings 20 times or acknowledge when someone comes in for their carryout order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=20
C.Michael T.,"Campbell, CA",249,50,,1.0,10/19/2017,"I was there today with my sister.  John, who was our waiter, was very personable, but he forgot the extra blue cheese, had to ask for Wipes, had to ask for a refill, potato was not cooked and was raw, took forever to get a new potato.  Where was the manager to help?  I thought the manager would come over and offer something because the food was not cooked.  I saw him there wondering around.  Not impressed. Had told my sister how good the one was in San Jose, Ca.  She said that she would not be back.  Such a letdown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=20
Joshua T.,"Seymour, IN",0,1,,1.0,6/18/2017,"We checked in online using their app, at the time it seemed like we were the ""smart ones"" since people were calling in and not getting put on the list from overhearing them talk outside. Well that being said we waited for our 35 minute quote time and nothing, 45 minutes... nothing. Finally I walked in to ask where we were in line and the hostess stated that she miss informed us our wait time and it would be ANOTHER 35-40 minutes from now. Unreal. People are having the same issues and walking out, causing scenes in the parking lot. I would say this isn't the best first impression... 2 stars... would be a one star but the bar staff was friendly. Update: Looked at the hostess screen, there are table who have been here for 45 minutes (of 3-4) getting sat in front of us who have been waiting 95 mins (from their screen) HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. Taking my family elsewhere. Don't waste your time or money. Dropped to a 1 star for good reasons",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=20
JimandCathleen V.,"Cicero, IN",2,50,6,2.0,5/8/2017,"Been 3 times now. The food is great or I would have given 1 star.  However, the service is always slow/bad. (Bar &  restaurant ) Had to get our own menus first visit. Had to request silverware on visit one & two. Always have to ask for drink refills.  They can't seem to get the timing down with appetizers & food. If you don't mind your appetizers arriving with your meal, it's fine. (Our first visit the waiter said he would remove app from bill, but he didn't.  We didn't mind paying for it because we ate it)  There are so many places to eat around HTC poor service will kill a business. Too many places to choose from.  The parking lot is a disaster too.  Husband did enjoy the beer selection and prices.  I had a $10 Long Island ice tea on our first visit.

Laura S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,1.0,3/22/2017,"Horrible service. Went there when they first opened and waited 25 min at our table for a waitress to even show up.  Decided to give it a second chance and was still a horrible experience. Used the app to get our name on the list before leaving the house. Showed up and was told 20 min wait. 40 min later still no table and still told a 15-20 min wait. They then accidentally seated another group at our table, they got the ""names on the list confused"". Again told 15-20 min wait. We waited. 20 min later still no table. When approached by the manager he said ""calling ahead or using the app ahead of time didn't mean anything, your time doesn't start until you get to the restaurant"". I understand it's not a reservation but why am I not put on the list until after I show up? We walked out and he called 5 min later to tell us he'd have a table ready in 20 min.

Robin G.,"Indianapolis, IN",5,1,,4.0,10/22/2017,"Good food,  but hard to enjoy my food because of a football game on with the sound so loud you cannot carry on a conversation.  I have no problem with sports on Tv's but having the sound so loud you cannt hear anything else is irritating.

Rachel C.,"Fishers, IN",119,172,306,5.0,3/10/2017,Stellar service and food!! Our server was great about walking us through the history and background info of the restaurant as it is a new chain here in Indiana. He even let us know that if we downloaded the BJ's app on our phone we could receive a free mini pizookie (pizza cookie) ((it's so worth!)). I love that they have a health conscious section in their menu and how expansive their menu is in general. My husband and I shared an order of the turkey burger and a seared ahi salad. Food came out quickly and man it was DELICIOUS. I think I'm going to start getting into turkey burgers because of this burger. It was so juicy and flavorful; and the added dried cranberries with a kick of Dijon mustard on the burger just sent it to another level. The ahi salad was great as well. I loved how they added nori (seaweed) all over the dish and it really made me feel like I was eating a sushi dish without the carbs! And of course to finish off our lunch we were rewarded with a mini white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie A LA FREAKING MODE. ON THE HOUSE. Definitely looking forward to coming back for dinner!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=20
Melissa C.,"Westfield, IN",0,2,,4.0,3/19/2017,"I highly recommend using the app to cut down the wait time.

Birgitta H.,"Fishers, IN",37,17,1,4.0,8/13/2017,"Decided to have my birthday dinner at BJ's.  Called ahead and did not have to wait more than a couple of minutes. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. The decor is cool and fun, a little loud but that's to be expected.  We enjoyed the appetizer sampler first. Great mix w mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, artichoke dip, and wings. We all ordered different menu items for our dinners. Everyone was very happy with their selections. The burgers are huge and juicy, steak was made perfectly to order and the mashed potatoes are delicious. The thin crust pizza is light and lets you enjoy the flavors of the generous toppings. The cherry glazed salmon was cooked just right and served with fresh and flavorful couscous and veggies. Since it was a birthday celebration, we finished the dinner by sharing a couple of the famous Pizookies, salted caramel and chocolate chip. A decadent way to end a great meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=20

Kennedy R.,"Fishers, IN",3,71,25,4.0,2/26/2017,"Visited bjs twice in a row this weekend, once with friends and once on a quick date before a movie and was not disappointed either time! They have excellent house brand beer that isn't brewed on site but still worth the $5.50ish per pint. On Wednesdays house pints will run you $4 :) The fried mozzarella appetizer was very large for the price and the trio of pizzookies was the perfect size to share!

Once I called to inquire about my mistaken pizza I was on hold for 9 + minutes and was told it would be an hour to replace my said pizza.

Blayke L.,"Noblesville, IN",157,5,,5.0,6/20/2017,"We lived by a BJ's in Houston and were excited to see one here! This place is ALWAYS packed. Expect a wait. Food and service were great! Family friendly!! Our server was amazing, wish I could remember his name! Despite being extremely busy, he was very attentive to our table and amazing with our 4 year old. The menu is huge and has so many amazing choices. I ended uo getting the ahi tuna salad which was so tasty and very filling. My fiance got the double bacon guacamole burger... he is obsessed and hasn't stopped thinking about since! The manager stopped by each and every table including ours to see how our visit was. He was extremely friendly as well. Great addition to the area! Excited to bring visiting family and friends here.

Leigh M.,"Brighton, MI",294,1,,5.0,1/2/2018,"I want to preface this review with the fact that I NEVER leave reviews. Ever.  And also the fact that I don't live in Indiana, but when I'm in town this is definitely top of my list to frequent!!  We went here for dinner tonight for my birthday and I'm so happy we did!! I'm giving BJ's 5-stars for obviously the food - there were SO many choices that even the pickiest eater could get something they want. We each got such different dishes and all across the board each dish was amazing. On top of that, I wish we could give more than 5-stars because our waiter, Nyree, was the SWEETEST. He was the perfect combination of attentive, professional, and laid-back. Everything he did was absolute quality. He even sang happy birthday to me - all by himself! He could have just brought me the free pizookie and left, but he sang and I thought that was so kind. I had one of the nicest birthday dinners because of it (it's the little  things, right?) So thank you, BJ's, for having such yummy food and thank you, Nyree, for such excellent service!! You made my birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2

On the plus side, there was a lot to choose from on the menu. There are a lot of health conscious options. The strawberry lemonade was amazing. The dining area is very spacious.

Ken C.,"French Lick, IN",1,2,,5.0,12/6/2017,"Have been to BJ's twice recently and I now consider it one of my go-to spots for dining out.  I like that they take some risks with their menu instead of just offering the same old bar food as many other chains do.   Specifically, I highly recommend ordering from the ""Enlightened Entrees"" menu.  I have tried both the Roasted Shrimp Peruvian Quinoa Bowl and the Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles and they were both delicious (although the peanut chicken is my preference).   For an appetizer, I wouldn't pass up the chance to order the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts.  Delicious! The only negative for me were the house beers.  They were very mediocre (except for the Grand Cru seasonal and the Red Ale which were both above average).  However, they seem to offer a variety of local guest craft beers so you should be able to find something enjoyable. Highly recommended!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2
Rob M.,"Indianapolis, IN",107,47,22,4.0,11/22/2017,"I recently visited BJ's for the first time with my parents. We all enjoyed our meals and drinks for the most part and our server was a fun guy once we got him to open up. The first beer that I got was a bit disappointing. I got BJ's amber ale (I can't remember the name of it) and it seemed like it lacked flavor. When I think of amber ales I typically associate a lot of flavor with a little bit of hop in it. As ambers go this one was very bland. It had very little flavor with not hop (I can take or leave the hop, but the flavor is important). I also got BJ's pumpkin ale, which was better and tasted as expected. We also ordered food. We all got a broccoli cheddar soup and mom got an order of ribs. The soup was very good and apparently the ribs were great as well.  Overall, I plan on making another visit to BJ's sometime! Thanks for the drinks, food, and service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2
Kerisa S.,"Fishers, IN",111,64,59,5.0,8/17/2017,"It's been a long while since my last review. Why? Summer chaos! So many wedding activities, travel, family functions, work stress, dog responsibilities, the list goes on and on and on! I just really haven't had the time. However, since I visited BJ's 3 times in 1 week I think I will take a quick minute and write about them!  I know BJ's has been open in noblesville for a while now and the parking lot is always packed. I never felt a need to go as I have gone to the one in Greenwood and one in Oklahoma City. Those restaurants were good, okay, nothing to write home about so didn't really care when BJ's opened here. However, my husband and I have gotten into this kick of attending the same 1-3 restaurants over and over and over again this summer with our busy lifestyles (another reason I was on review hiatus). I wanted to stay close to home one Friday but nothing elaborate  instead of the normal 3 we had been frequenting. I suggested BJ's.  Parking lot was packed when we arrived and the wait was 40 min but we don't like tables anyway and lucked out finding two seats at the bar. Our bar tender Carolyn was super friendly and helpful. I literally asked to see every Belgian beer bottle before I made my selection- and she was fine with it! She rocks. By the way, the one I picked (Delirium) was AMAZING and I recommend!  I was excited to see a menu with so many options. Seemed bigger than what I remembered from the other locations. AND they have gluten free pizza!  of course I asked Carolyn a million questions again and picked it because she said it would be a crispy crust and I hate doughy pizza. My husband ordered the Hawaiian deep dish pizza. I just got sausage pepperoni and mushroom on mine.  When they came out my pizza sadly was not crispy but doughy/maybe undercooked in the dough. I asked her what happened!? She was mortified and immediately took care of it for me. A guy from the kitchen - maybe a manager- came out and said he was sorry she even told them extra crispy and they were going to fix it right away. They did, and it was AMAZING! Best gluten free pizza I have yet honestly.  Overall great night and great experience.  Sunday -2 days later- rolls around and we go to lunch with my husbands friend to the place we always go to, one of the 3 and sitting there I was blah. I don't like their alcohol beer wine selection and food is eh. I quickly asked if they could finish their drinks and we go to BJ's to eat instead. We did! Sat at the bar again. Had Carolyn again. Everyone super fun and friendly again. Great experience.  Tried the tuna sashimi salad and it was okay, it just wasn't my pizza. Also got the couscous Mac and cheese which is a small plate but very cheesy. Husband and I loved but you need to be a big cheese lover. Drank my beer again!  Wednesday then rolls around and my husband went back to eat there since we didn't want to cook before leaving on Thursday for a short vacation. Carolyn was our bartender again, this time we were on first name basis and she knows my drink. I already felt like a regular and quite at home. Decided to try a burger but I already forgot which one, but it WAS good. Still tho- gluten free is still my fave. I've honestly been craving it all day today I think I'll make a trip there this weekend after being out of town the past  two weekends. Also need my delirium fix!  Definitely worth a try. Menu is huge. If you don't fall in love right away, try again, there are so many options! They also have a rewards program I discovered on the Wednesday visit and signed up for. Who doesn't like rewards!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2
Kelly M.,"Indianapolis, IN",329,50,39,3.0,7/24/2017,Decent place.  Reminds me of a mix of Scottys brew house with a TGI Friday's. Very extensive menu with a variety of things.

Tiffany C.,"Fishers, IN",9,66,111,5.0,6/4/2017,"Ordered take out the other day and the food was delicious! I'm a salad girl so I got the Ahi Tuna. I will definitely be ordering out again and hopefully dining in very soon!  UPDATE: is it possible for a restaurant to continuously go downhill!? Unfortunately, after the first try every time after they've constantly made my order wrong. I am a salad girl so it shouldn't be that difficult.  But be aware what is on the menu is NOT what you'll receive.  Tip: if ordering out check your order.  I've continued to order from here because once I remind them what the menu says they'll add the ingredients. Then the salads are great!  While waiting for them to remake my order I was writing this review and the manager HALERIE remade my salad and comped me without asking.

Lavel L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",10,137,582,2.0,5/25/2017,"I am here on business and I came to this establishment for a late dinner. I have been to other BJ's and it was ""ok"", so I knew what I was getting.. First off I want to say that my waiter Eydie S was phenomenal!  She has been one of the best waiters that I have ever had.. Kept my strawberry lemonade replenished, recommended things on the menu, recommended things to do in the local area, just overall didn't seem like she was just there to do a job.   For my appetizer I got the stuffed mushrooms which were ok, I wouldn't get them again. They lacked flavor, and were just ok.. Almost, borderline not ok.. LOL For my dinner I choose the Turkey burger which again, was just ok and lacked flavor. Also I noticed that the patty was very small, it didn't even fill the bun! I got fries as a side, which came out hot and fresh.. But you really can't mess fries up. For desert I tried (3) small pazookies.. I tried the cookies and cream, chocolate, and macadamia nut one. All were good! Eydie and desert were the highlight of the meal/visit.. I am not sure if I will be back or should I say, I won't be going out of my way to go to BJ's.

Lauren W.,"Fishers, IN",137,97,1093,4.0,2/22/2017,"BJ's is just what the Noblesville/Fishers area needed! The restaurant has a fun and lively atmosphere.  They serve a variety of craft beers, both their own BJ's brewed beer and a small selection of local microbrews. BJs is known for their handcrafted draft sodas that are made fresh daily. If neither of those beverages strike your fancy, they have a huge selection of cocktails and wine. They have about anything you could ever want on the menu...variety of appetizers, pasta, soup, pizza (both deep dish and flatbreads), ribs, chicken entrees, steak, sandwiches, salads and of course dessert...the Pizookie (I'll get to that later)!  We ordered chicken pot stickers, sriracha queso, a golden beat and arugula salad, and BJ's Brewhouse Classic tavern-cut pizza. All of the food was great! My favorite part of the meal was the Pizookie...a cookie in the form of a pizza what's not to love! It was Tuesday night, so the Pizookies were only $3 each. We ordered the chocolate chunk, which had two scoops of delicious vanilla ice cream on top of a warm chocolate chip cookie! They have 9 different flavors of Pizookies. I can't wait to go back and try another!  My only compliant is that the service was slow and the staff was not very attentive. The restaurant was packed when I went and they recently just opened, so perhaps that is why. BJ's has something for everyone and the food is delicious.

The tap list is impressive and is not limited to BJ's own beers--although as a lover of craft beer, I enjoy trying the seasonal choices.

Tony M.,"Indianapolis, IN",43,51,47,5.0,3/5/2017,"The great -  1) Mommy was blown away by the complimentary kids starter that included a little garlic knot and.a mini fresh fruit cup. This place gets that a happy child makes happy parents.  2) Rachel was phenomenal. She offered suggestions and was incredibly attentive to our every need.   3) Mommy was very pleased with the small beer tasters that allowed her to audition a couple of the many craft beers that are available on tap. The Jeremiah Red mixed with the Berry Burst Cider was very nice if you want to stay away from hoppy, bold beers.  The good -  1) The Barbacoa Cauliflower tacos were very flavorful but the pita offered just a bit too much breading for my taste. Would have loved them on a simple corn tortilla. I was served with side of red quinoa and brown rice super salad. My wife liked it very much.  2) The Turkey Burger was very good but the spicy mustard was a bit too bold for my wife. Without it it would have warranted an excellent rating.  The Could Have Been Better - 1) The Calamari was tough and chewy and was not a favorite.

Craig M.,"Fishers, IN",5,62,33,3.0,3/26/2017,"We have been here twice, so this is a combination of two visits... Service is slow, seems unorganized, and the handhelds for ordering seem to slow the process from a customer perspective.  But with that said, the orders we've had were accurate. Both visits, there are a lot of people working the tables and it seems like they aren't fully communicating who's doing what. Staff has been friendly both visits. The foods is pretty average.  Nothing special.  We've had a combination of burgers, pizzas, salads, and pasta dishes, plus an appetizer & desserts. My deep dish reminded me of Pizza Hut's, but no where near as greasy as PH's.  Flavor was fine, but somewhat pricey for the quality. Pasta had good flavor. Salad at our table looked fine, but the ahi looks a ton smaller that the menu photo. Desserts were good, and our kids liked them a lot. The beers were decent as well.  Had multiple IPAs (which we enjoyed) and a bourbon barrel aged stout, which was just okay for the style.  It got better as it warmed, because it's served at a temperature colder than recommended for stouts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2
Joe H.,"Fishers, IN",0,13,,4.0,12/3/2017,This place is pretty solid. The location and parking are pretty convenient. The atmosphere is slightly above average although nothing that special. The bar has a cool look to it. The staff seems pretty friendly. I had a nice chat with the bartender and she was pretty chatty and fun. The food is actually pretty delicious. They have great specials on certain days as well. I haven't had a chance to try their pizza yet but I bet it's pretty good. I had their hand pulled turkey dip and it was really delicious. The horseradish sauce with it is insanely good. I really like their beer selection here too. I'm a big fan of their Jeremiah Red beer. It's tasty and has a high alcohol content. They also have a great selection of cream sodas and root beer. I definitely recommend this place it hasn't done me wrong so far.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2

We were sat rather quickly,(Sunday Night mind you) and our Server John was on top of things from the get go. We did however wait abnormally long for our beverages to hit the table, (Diet Pepsi). We ordered the queso, salsa, and the Brussel Sprouts. The chips were really greasy and stayed that way, almost like the oil wasn't hot enough and just saturated them. The Brussel Sprouts were great except for the random burnt french fries that were mixed in. Our main courses by the way were great! The Alfredo is always good and the salad my wife had was fresh and crisp.  Like I said John was all over it and made the night great for some of the little mishaps from the kitchen.

Our server was awesome. I wish I knew her name. She was fast, knew what she was doing, and very helpful. But our second visit ( tonight) was another story. First off I added my name to the wait list, went in to check in, they told me it would be 40 minutes at the latest. Okay sounds great. So we hung out for 50 minutes, then asked how much longer, they said about 10 minutes there was one other 2 top in front of us. Okay thank you. Well as we were standing there waiting I noticed that there was a table that was dirty. So I just kinda watched it for a little. A server came to take off the check book, then it sat there for 8 minutes. There were 4 managers standing around talking not 2 feet away. About 2 minutes later a manager come and puts all the glasses together but just left it there. I waited about 5 more minutes the went to say something. As I was saying something to the manager someone clean off the table. I was explaining to a manager what I have noticed and he just said there are two people waiting can you wait 5 minutes then we will take care of you. NO SORRY OR EXPLANATION. He just looked at me like I was stupid and just walked away. I wasn't even done talking to him. This continued to bother me through the night because I felt like I was not important. We finally got seated and the servers took very good care of us. My only concern was that when the servers are putting in our order they kinda Hover over and it's hard to talk without feeling rude. Besides that the rest of dinner was nice.

Food took more than 30 minutes and our server acknowledged that she thought they were plating our order but wasn't sure. Food finally came out, pizza was soggy, burgers were luke warm. Rather than make a issue and wait more we ate and paid. What really bothered me though is that this is a craft beer place and usually their house beer is pretty good. Today I was served a house Oktoberfest beer that was clearly off and shouldn't have been served to anyone.

Jackie B.,"Fishers, IN",0,5,,1.0,7/4/2017,"I am not one who posts on Yelp often; however, I feel that our experience needs to be shared with others.   I was extremely disappointed with our service on the evening of July 4th.  My family and I visited the restaurant for dinner.  We were seated about 7:30 and were greeted promptly by our server. He was very nice, a little stressed because he had several tables sat around the same time. However, he was quick with the drinks and placing our order.  My husband's salad and my son's kids appetizer plate were delivered very quickly after our order was placed, so all was good.   However, timed started to tick by.  Ten ... fifteen ... twenty ... thirty ... forty-five ... almost an HOUR later, part of my son's dinner was brought out.  Approximately 10 minutes after that, part of my dinner was brought out. I notified the server of the missing items and my husband's meal and he assured us that everything would be out quickly, and he would return with the missing sides.  The server brings the sides and another 10 minutes go by and my husband finally gets his meal.  His ribeye steak was the worst steak he or I have ever had.  He ordered it medium; however, it was more than well done.  The steak was seasoned so poorly that he couldn't even eat it.   It was clear throughout the meal that something was wrong in the kitchen as we noticed that no one in our section had food and no food was being brought out of the kitchen.  Eventually, the managers started walking around with the tickets for each table; however, neither one ever made it to all of the tables.  It seemed that only certain tables were selected.  We asked our waiter and other waiters to send the manager to our table; however after 15 minutes of waiting, the manager never spoke with us.  We heard rumors from other tables about the debacles in the kitchen (technology issues, staff walking out, managers trying to cook the food, etc); however, I find it quite inconsiderate that the managers didn't have the decency to speak with each individual table.  What makes me even more frustrated with this situation is we still received a bill.  Really!?!  After an hour of waiting and poor food, we still received a bill and the managers expected the servers to handle the frustrated customers.  It seems to me that the managers don't always have the procedures / logistics down to run a restaurant effectively, and that is sad.  I am disappointed in this experience and the food.  BJ's is no longer a restaurant that we will return to as they don't seem to respect all of their customers and don't place value in the customer service & logistics needed to run an effective restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40
Gern B.,"Noblesville, IN",3,110,,4.0,3/5/2017,Probably 3.5 stars. Service was great. We used the app to get on the wait list. People in front of us were being told 45 minutes but we waited about 10.  Food was good but my mashed potatoes were cold and very average. Not what I expected.  Beer was great but $5.75 /pint... Kinda expensive overall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40
Meggan B.,"Ingalls, IN",4,5,2,4.0,11/19/2017,"My girlfriend and I were out and about Saturday night and needed drinks and food before our movie. Walked in to BJ's was told it was going to be a 20 min wait. Totally fine with us. My friend turned to me and said, ""if only we could get a couple drinks from the bar while we wait."" Low and behold a lovely lady from the bar came around the corner to get our drink order while we wait. Nice. I'll be honest the food menu was way too big. I was a bit skeptical of the quality with that size of a menu. I've worked in the restaurant business for years so I have a bit of insight I feel. We decided to split the prime rib special since I had food earlier, our waiter didn't seem happy about that at all. I understand with the check average dipping a bit, but we have several drinks and as long as the service was good I'm always going to tip20% or greater. He came back with a smile and a joke and made everything better. I enjoyed the prime rib, and the dessert was delicious. I'll be back for sure. Keep it up guys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40
Lilia H.,"Fishers, IN",65,3,6,3.0,7/19/2017,First time I went for lunch and it was good. Next time I waited for 40 minutes and then took 10 minutes to get a waiter to come over. Because we waited so long we ordered an appetizer. Later we ordered dinner. Dinner came and no appetizer. All three of us were not that impressed with the food. Waiter was nice but clearly overwhelmed and I had to chase him down to get the check and again to pay. This was at 6 on a weeknight.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40
Kyle F.,"Fishers, IN",0,6,,1.0,9/4/2017,"One of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant.    At 1:30 on a Labor Day afternoon (place wasn't that crowded) it took over 35 minutes to get out appetizer and never did get a drink refill.   When I finally tracked down a manager (our server disappeared) he offered no apologies, but just said he would ""try to find our chips and queso"".   It did finally come, but at 45 plus minutes since we ordered we are still waiting on our food.   With all for the restaurants to choose from around HTC, this will probably be our last to BJs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40

John G.,"Noblesville, IN",562,10,21,5.0,8/4/2017,Amazing food and great atmosphere. Get the pizza and try one of their craft beers.  Have gone to BJ's several times and have not been disappointed once.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40
Brett H.,"Indianapolis, IN",99,4,,5.0,8/12/2017,"I have now been twice, and both visits were very pleasant. The server had good energy, with a nice knowledge of the menu and beers. Lots of options so it's hard to decide, and have yet to be let down with my choice. The beer was good both times and the service was on point. Would recommend giving this place a shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40

PollY S.,"Fishers, IN",94,12,2,4.0,8/4/2017,"I've had their Ahi Tuna salad a couple times. The tuna is great but the salad dressing on the salad is pretty bland. The bison burger was great but somehow they managed to overcook the fries and they were cold.

Amber J.,"Fishers, IN",0,7,1,4.0,4/22/2017,"Great dining experience. Our server, Lynn, was attentive and very friendly. We had the deep dish pizza and it was delicious.

Markel W.,"Noblesville, IN",21,55,74,4.0,2/28/2017,"This is a new spot right outside the HTC facility and it was a pleasant surprise. While it was a long line to have a seat at the table, there was plenty of room at the bar. They brew an array of their own beers, so there's a huge variety. The facility itself is very attractive. We order dinner and appetizers. The appetizer portion was very sufficient and ended up filling me up prior to dinner. I ate my dinner the next day for lunch, salmon, and it was still delicious the next day. But for all of this, the bill was unexpectedly high. I'd give it $$$. The calamari was pretty good an the sriracha wings were on point. I'm looking forward to our next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40
Tim B.,"Fishers, IN",0,2,,1.0,4/3/2017,"Awful service. They did about everything wrong that they could have. 3 different servers and were left sitting for 20 mins before even ordering. Server spilled beer on my wife and didn't apologize. Kids got wrong drinks, wife got wrong meal. They promised the right drinks and meal would come out right away but they never came. Tried to offer us a free dessert but we declined-we couldn't get out of there fast enough. Will not be giving them another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40
Jeremiah L.,"Frisco, TX",100,3,,3.0,7/20/2017,"I had never been to BJ's before so I wasn't sure what to expect...And to be honest it wasn't the greatest. The service we received from the bartender Sarah was good and she was very hospitable. But the food was my problem with this place. The food in general was...passable, but they also had us waiting for almost 45 minutes. In the end...It wasn't worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40
Margaret P.,"Noblesville, IN",30,28,1,2.0,5/1/2017,"I have visited the Noblesville location several times. My experience has been awesome up until this visit. My food has been great each time. My service the first visit was excellent on every level. I recommend this place highly to all of our hotel guest looking for a place to eat,drink,and meet with business people for conversation. That being said,in hesitatant at this point to do so. I brought a friend to lunch after church,was greeted promptly and curtious. Was seated quickly,and was quite pleased. We was greeted by our server asked for drink order then is when things turned. We wanted an appetizer as we were deciding what to order and just have a very casual relaxing lunch and conversation. As she took our app order she said so what do you want to order for lunch? I volunteered we'd like to just enjoy our appetizer for a bit. Not to her liking she asked again as soon as she saw the runner deliver the app.again I declined to order. Third time we did go ahead and order. Our server wasn't very informed to preparation of the mushroom burger.and didn't care to find an answer to my friends question only wanted our order. I ordered the mahi mahi and   was good not great... We had barely started eating when our server approached our table with my fork headed to my mouth her question wasn't how's your food tasting,is everything okay can I get you anything,none of the normal,just do y'all need a box??? Dumbfounded I gestured to my unbeaten meal,and stated no mam were eating but thank you. Well I can take this if you want to the app.,no thank you,we are still working on that also. No refills was offered for our drinks. I asked for a dessert menu later as none was offered. My friend had a after dinner drink the server don't understand the order so she was charged a full kaluha a full bailys for a cup of coffee which was a 15.50 cup of coffee. I only had a decade with our cookie Sunday. So great place great concept good food but the service on this occasion made for a very unpleasant day. I did have a buy one get one coupon which was good. However I still tip on the original amount. I really shouldn't have on this trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-noblesville-2?start=40
