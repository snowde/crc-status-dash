Fran V.,"Oklahoma City, OK",326,156,320,4.0,12/27/2017,Came for a birthday dinner and all was great. We were served in a decent time and checked on every couple minutes for water and drinks. Great lighting and atmosphere for something intimate. I loved the setting. Great spot n their menu I didn't give it a 5 because their drinks could be a little stronger my mojito tasted like water basically.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman
Alex M.,"Dallas, TX",63,35,21,1.0,11/28/2017,"Received the absolute worst service from incompetent staff! My boyfriend and I went here on a Friday afternoon hoping to snag a good Happy Hour. Turns out, they just changed their Happy Hour menu to not include Friday's (though both of the staff that spoke to us had no idea). We started with the queso, which is just artificial cheese dip, and I had the Mediterranean chicken tacos. They were small and had a few morsels of chicken smothered in white sauce. Not great. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken bites which tasted like they had been nuked in the microwave after being frozen.  BUT the worst part was after the meal.. my boyfriend left his phone behind and didn't realize until after we had left. When he tracked his phone on his Tile app, he saw it was located at BJ's. We called the manager that night and they said they would look for it during their ""nightly clean."" We called again in the morning, got transferred to three different people asking how they could help us (hand the phone to someone who can please) and they said they hadn't found the wallet but would ""keep looking."" I even told them which booth we sat at, and they swore they looked but couldn't locate it. Finally, we were able to drive back up to BJ's. We immediately go to the booth we sat at a few nights before and what do you know... the wallet is underneath the table sitting in water. Are you kidding me BJ's? So much for a nightly clean. Totally unprofessional and unhelpful - definitely will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman

Lorri A.,"Oklahoma City, OK",55,39,348,4.0,12/22/2017,"Dining in is good. The wait time really isn't that bad. They have a huge menu. So, if you want it they probably have it. Drinks at the bar are good and service is pretty quick. However,  their curbside pick up and just regular pick up orders is lacking. Went to pick up on a Friday and all the spots for curbside were full.  Parked at bfe went in to get curbside order and waited around for a good 10 mins. I had servers walk past me and not even ask if I needed help. Same thing goes when I order pick up. I pick a specific time to pick up, I'm there to pick up at specific time. Apparently, your Togo order people didn't get the message because again I wait about 10 minutes to even get noticed.  Just aggravating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman

The food here is good, tastes like any normal Chain restaurant you can find around, large drink menu though and plenty of tv. Did not get a pizookie this time but it seems they've gotten more flavors since I last visited.

Nate S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",97,80,126,3.0,7/3/2017,"We came in a little after 3pm for the Monday special which is half off a large deep dish pizza. We were sat and tended to quickly and ordered waters, macaroni appetizer and a pizza. The app came out with the pizza and we wish we would have been told it would take so long. After we received our food the server checked up on us soon after then disappeared. We ran out of water shortly after the first checkup and had no help for miles. We were the only table in the center of the room. I had to stand up and fill our waters with the nearby pitcher and they didn't even notice. The divider walls are so tall I can see why it's easy to not see us but that should mean you need to put in more effort to attend to your tables. Also I worked in the service industry and know you are supposed to baby the crap out of customers when they're the only current source of business. The pizza was good though and we got free mini pizookie when we downloaded the free app.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman
Chase L.,"Norman, OK",54,4,,3.0,12/16/2017,"Great pizza and beer. Their Jeremiah Red is my favorite beer, sad it's not available anywhere. I know of at least one BJs in Texas where you can fill a growler of beer and take It home. Hopefully the laws change in Oklahoma soon. Went to this BJs last night with my fiancé. Had the thin pizza and some beers. Overall the food was great. We were sat right by the where the wait staff gathers to talk about what their tips were from each table, kind of uncomfortable. Also, our waitstaff seemed to rush us out.  Our chips and salsa appetizer was removed from the table before all our salsa was gone without asking us or offering More  chips. After we finished our pizza we were asked if we wanted dessert to which we said no. I was asked if i wanted another beer, my fiancé was not. When i got my 2nd beer, our ticket was closed without asking if we were finished. Only reason this gets 3 stars is for the Jeremiah Red and the good pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman
Rick R.,"Norman, OK",0,32,,3.0,6/19/2017,"Went here for an employment celebration after   our group could not decide where to go.  Honestly, it was not my choice.  Went on a Friday night and only had to wait 15 minutes  before being seated.   The ambiance is very tasteful and my table enjoyed the array of cocktails on the menu.  We all shared a combination appetizer plate which was somewhat cold and loaded with buffalo wings but lacking on the other items.  We all ordered something different and most enjoyed their meal.  I ordered  the Fish n' chips which was only fair and overly priced.  The fish was not cooked through and the breading fell off.  Dessert was fun as well as after dinner drinks.  Our server was wonderful, helpful and very thoughtful.  As mentioned, this would not have been my choice, but most seemed like they enjoyed it.  For the price and quality  of the food I justify my score!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman

Ashley P.,"Norman, OK",143,91,182,2.0,1/14/2017,"My boyfriend and I have officially been turned off from any and all BJ's because of this location, Pizookie's or no. I received an email from them asking how my experience was when I ate there last, and let me tell you - I absolutely reamed them. Seriously, it was a rrreaaalllyyy long email.  Visit #1 - Went with friend and ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. Omg people. I never spit food out. Ever. It's impolite, and isn't very attractive.  That being said, I took one bite of the chicken lettuce wrap and immediately (and unflatteringly) instinctively spit the food back out and began choking.  You want to talk about unnecessarily spicy? Yeah. That was it. I literally. *Literally* couldn't even eat the chicken part of the wrap because it was so flaming hot spicy.  I ended up just putting the dish to the side for the waitress to take.  The manager came over and apologized for the experience and offered to get me another item from the menu (I just opted to share a pizza with my friend) and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer.  Visit #2 & 3 - Went with boyfriend for a healthy dinner and ordered the sirloin steak with asparagus and a cup of clam chowder.  The clam chowder was ""meh,"" and came out cold. Not room temperature. Cold. As if someone had taken the soup out of the fridge and just dumped it in the bowl. Ew. We also didn't get any oyster crackers with them. :(  Now, I'm of the personal opinion that a steak and asparagus isn't exactly something that would be easy to screw up. *Buzzer* Wrong. The steak and asparagus were completely inedible. The spicyness and heat from the seasoning on the sirloin blew up my mouth and definitely irrigated my sinuses....sniffling, tears and all. The asparagus wasn't any better. They appeared to have thrown the asparagus onto a grill and then taken an entire bottle of ground pepper and poured it on top of the vegetable.  Needless to say, not only was it spicy as all heck, but the asparagus wasn't even cooked! It was still almost completely raw. At this point, I was too frustrated to call a manager. I didn't want to appear like one of *those* people who comes in and complains just to get free food, and my very long email to them went unanswered, so what's the point?  Not going back to this BJ's again. Maybe someday I'll work up the cajones and visit another location, but my lips can still feel the burn from that steak. Lips = traumatized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman
Lauren K.,"Oklahoma City, OK",97,104,204,3.0,2/5/2017,"I had the salmon quinoa and had severe food envy for the whole dinner, This is not the place to go if you're hoping for a really good healthy option.

The atmosphere is fun and classy, the hostesses are always so nice, and the wait staff is attentive.  You may wait a while on game nights; it IS a type of sports bar/grille, after all.

We were also seated very quickly in a nice booth. I have to also mention how beautiful the floors were! Loved them. Our waiter was very nice. I ordered the strawberry lemonade which I sadly had to send back- something was off, seemed like too much syrup?  He gladly took it back and gave me a regular lemonade instead. He also checked up on us several times and kept refilling my fiancé's water glass. I ordered the mini deep dish extreme pepperoni pizza- AMAZING.

Shawn G.,"Norman, OK",1,32,,4.0,6/22/2014,"I go to BJ's every so often and consider it ""in the rotation"" because the food and the service are almost always good. There's always a long wait on the weekends compared to other places because of this, but that can be avoided by using their curbside take away if you need food now. The dining experience is nice and is worth a wait if you find yourself here.  BJ's is a microbrewery and serves its own house brand of beers; they are quite good and you'll probably find one in the style you're looking for, but if you're not sure what you're looking at order their flight of beers and get a small sample of each one.  This is a great place to go and just hang out with friends or family because they have a huge assortment of appetizers, which I always find to match up well with any evening of extended drinking and chatting. Several years ago their Southwest Eggrolls pretty much set the bar for nouveau American appetizer food and were quickly copied by just about everyone.  Like several other posters have mentioned their pizzas are excellent. I usually build my own and am always really happy with it. I also recommend their chicken fried steak meal, it's also really good. If you're looking for something on the lighter side I have also enjoyed and recommend their balsamic chicken dish. For desert you really should try the pizookie - I don't really care for chocolate chip cookies myself but wow is theirs fantastic.

Stuart K.,"Saint Louis, MO",31,165,,3.0,12/11/2014,"OK  usually don't like chain restaurants, well because they are cookie cutters, and don't train their staff's well.   That is especially true in a college town with were high employee turnover shoulde be expected. BJ's is an exception except for one item.  I expect a Brewhouse that has a window looking at beer storage tanks to actually brew their product on site.  Not the case at BJ's as the brewing tanks are for show only. That said, their Blonde beer which is brewed in Houston by St. Arnold Beer (a tiny company with many different clever brews) is just plain super.  It was served cold and crisp and tastes great. Coming from St. Louis where Lasagna is a religion, BJ's did not meet that standard but was good.  My salad with blu cheese dressing not so much.  You should be able to recognize the taste of blu cheese and perhaps see a chunk or two of the tasty treat.

Josephine S.,"Norman, OK",135,90,139,3.0,4/18/2012,"Everyone has decided they want to go out to eat but no one can decide on what they want, so where do you go? Sometimes you strike a compromise, but sometimes BJ's is your best bet. The food can be a bit pricey, but the service is impeccable and they will make up for it tenfold if it isn't. The beer is always delicious. I love to do the seasonals, but the blonde and brunette are yummy, but then again, so are the rest of the brews. The flights are also a lot of fun to get so you can try them all for yourself and decide what you would like to have a full pint of. My favorite thing to eat there is their fish and chips, but their pizzas, burgers, sandwiches and salads are great too! For dessert they have all kinds of Pazookies (giant cookies topped with ice cream), like peanut butter, chocolate chip and at one point Oreo, that are great for sharing, but could be polished off alone. I won't judge you if you aren't into sharing desserts. Whether you are in a booth, at the bar or a table, the ambience is lively but not overly so and there is ample seating for a large group or a little spot a romantic duo can tuck away. Parking can be an issue around dinnertime on the weekends, as well as some weeknights so make sure you get there a little early and maybe even call ahead.

For our entree we split the Mediterranean Pizza. We got a large and it was a lot of food for two. We ended up eating a quarter of the pizza. On a first bite I wasn't really sure if I liked it or not but by the end I was a fan. Great food, great atmosphere, great experience... Thanks BJ's...

Christina S.,"Norman, OK",34,16,2,5.0,11/20/2016,I have been several times.  And it is one of my favorite places to take friends when they are visiting from out of town.  The ambiance is very nice.  A little on the expensive side.  I wish the service was better... its good but not great.  The hostess is always cheery and bright.  The Asian Chopped Salad is pretty darn good.  The Cherry Chilpote Salmon is delicious and my favorite is the avocado egg rolls and rootbeer glazed ribs.  I'll even have those as my meal.  The margherta pizza is meh.   But the pazookie dessert is a must.  Save room even if you have to share it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman?start=20

Rosa L.,"Carrollton, TX",0,23,,2.0,8/10/2015,"Want some over- priced nuked food? You'll get it here. We ordered a Caesar salad but they were out of Caesar salad dressing, That should have been a tip that the food here was not freshly prepared. We settled for the wedge instead. Ugh. Not sure what the basic dressing was on this salad but it was thin, kind of slimy sweet/tart white stuff with a couple bleu cheese sprinkles on it. The wedge was a very small piece of iceberg lettuce with some chopped tomato and hard, not crisp, bacon crumbled on it. Not good. Our shared entrée was a deep dish pizza. Sort of. Basically it was lukewarm dough served in a deep dish pizza pan. It was topped with meatballs which also tasted like dough so I'm thinking they must have a lot of bread in them, stringy mozzarella cheese, chunks of tomato that tasted like they were freshly plucked from a can and a smattering of tough hot white onions. We were starved so we ate the mess, waited and waited for refills on our drinks and got out of there fast.  Service was lackluster from our front desk greeter seater who was in love with his cell phone to the manager who brought out our lukewarm pizza. The server introduce herself or show up much after bringing our drinks. This place is just a definite ""just keep looking for something better"" kind of place. This was our first time at any of the BJ's locations so I can't say that they're all like this one. I sure hope that they aren't.

J Jason B.,"Atlanta, GA",121,89,12,4.0,8/20/2015,"BJ's is one of those places that I think about going to often but only get there about twice a year.  Maybe because I always prefer to not eat at a chain when I do go out, but as far as corporate places go in Nompton, BJ's is probably my fave.  And by the way, I feel stupid reviewing corporate places.  There's over 100 BJ's in this great nation and chances are you've been to one.  So if you haven't been to one, say you're new to America, or you've only just become old enough to eat out, or maybe you're 16 and you just got a license and before this your parents never took you out to eat.  Maybe you lived waaaaaay out in the country,,, anyway, if any of these conditions apply or you'd like to know more about this particular BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, by all means keep reading. I guess I'd describe BJ's as if Cheesecake Factory and Spaghetti Warehouse had a baby, which by the way- gross.  Cheesecake and spaghetti should never be imagined together like that.  BJ's lacks the baroque grandeur of Cheesecake Factory, but the plush seating and attentive, pleasant, well trained service put BJ's in a different league than Spaghetti Warehouse.  The menu is American cuisine, which is to say, pretty much Italian cuisine with a good number of dishes that aren't Italian.  Pizza, pasta, steak, chicken, potatoes, burgers... cookies.  Anyone can find something they like here (even vegetablists like myself.)  If not, ditch em.  Seriously.  Even my dad, who thinks that 5 cheese blend on a pizza is just a way of skimping on mozzarella, can find something he likes, (which was, not surprisingly, an all mozzarella pizza with sausage.) As far as decor, all the BJ's I've been to are nice, but I really like this one in Norman. The building was a Don Pablos for years and even though its essentially the same building, its nearly impossible to tell, what once was once a loud faux barrio is now cavernous, upscale, and fresh. BJ's is not cheap, its not expensive.  I'd say you get what you pay for, so if you're down for something nice I think BJ's is always worth the money.  That, I guess, is probably what keeps me from going there more often, that or the location.  Which reminds me, if you are new to Norman or are in the area on a business trip (unlikely) or perhaps are in town for one of our many (sarcastic) festivals, here's a good way to get to BJ's:  by helicopter.  BJ's sits on the finest lot in the most poorly planned business park ever.  Lets put all these businesses on a divided winding frontage road with no highway access and let's put an entrance at the apex of each blind corner.  Great going, city. BJ's also brews their own beer and has a full bar, its a great place to watch a game.  There's a good view of at least one television from (probably) every seat. Their signature dessert, the pizookie, is never as good in real life as it is in my head.  That said, I want one now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman?start=20

Service was the main downfall for our party.  I went 10-15 minutes at times with an empty glass.  At one point, I asked the server to just bring two glasses of tea with her as she kept apologizing for being so slow.  The sad part is that the restaurant was not busy and she only appeared to have a few tables.

Chelsea S.,"Widener, AR",27,4,,4.0,12/7/2014,"Visited BJ's after the Bedlam game in Norman and despite a packed house and long line of people waiting we were sat in about 30 min. Not bad at all considering the volume and we easily got a drink from the bar while we waited.  The restaurant was very large, clean, and had a variety of seating options. Our server did a great job! Our group of 4 was pretty vocal and he played right along with us joking and got everything on our order correct. The host who sat us was also very friendly and made us feel very comfortable, apologizing for the wait. All the staff we came in contact with from the bartender to the food runners were well put together, spoke clearly, and interacted with our table very well. As a customer service manager in the restaurant industry I take notice of this very quickly! We had 3 appetizers:  Thai Shrimp Lettuce wraps - mediocre, not a lot of flavor and the lettuce was way too large for the filling.  Ahi Poke - basically a rare ahi tuna tartare served with a nutty soy dipping sauce was very very good! It didn't last long and we thought about ordering another. Full of flavor and served at the perfect cool temperature.  Calamari - breading was tasty, didn't wow me but calamari is pretty standard to prepare. Served with 2 dipping sauces a spicy ranch and a barbecue something. Good portion for 4! We were all very pleased with our entrees, after spending awhile going through their extensive options. They literally have just about everything, pizzas, pasta, steak, burgers, soups, salads, chicken, and seafood.  We had: Lemon Chicken Pasta - angel hair pasta, with a creamy lemon, butter sauce served with 2 chicken breasts, steamed spinach, and artichoke hearts. Very good portion of food and full of flavor, not too heavy for a pasta dish.  Deep Dish Baked Lasagna - made with ricotta cheese, it was baked perfectly and full of fillings.  NY Strip - cooked to order, med-rare with 2 sides of choice: horseradish mashed potatoes and asparagus  Ribeye - cooked to order, med-rare with the mash and broccoli  Overall, I recommend BJ's for all demographics from families to solo travelers. It has so much to offer even the pickiest eater should find something satisfying served at an affordable price range.

Nick D.,"Union City, CA",265,101,5,3.0,9/28/2010,"I can't say much about this locale that distinguishes it from other BJs I've been to.  The pizza was just fine (we had the BJ's Favorite), the baja spring rolls were just fine and the seasonal Oktoberfest beer was outstanding.  The Oktoberfest was kind of sweet and it put me off at first, but I really started to enjoy the flavor after the first few sips.  I highly recommend the Oktoberfest. To address the negative reviews, I didn't have a bad experience here.  I notice that people will post negative experiences more often than they will post positive ones.  For me, at BJs, you get what you pay for, the prices are a bit higher, the food quality is always slightly above average.   As for beer, there's no point ordering anything but one of their signature microbrew at BJs.  There are many other spots in town with beer specials (Sooner Legends has $2 domestics all the time), but BJs is known for their microbrews, so of course they are going to charge you a higher premium for ordering something that they don't make themselves.  And, honestly, their microbrews are good!  Find the one that fits your taste and try something new (or get the beer sampler and try them all). I was completely satisfied with my experience here, I came in knowing and expecting three star quality and that is exactly what I got plus the pleasure of a tasty seasonal beer in the Oktoberfest microbrew.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman?start=60

Jane D.,"Austin, TX",0,18,,1.0,3/29/2010,"I hate to leave this review but I feel I must because I recently had the worst dining experience in a very long time at this restaurant. Please keep in mind: this review is only for the NORMAN,OK BJ's. I have repeatedly dined at the BJ's in both Austin, TX and Addison, TX repeatedly and have never had a problem.  The Norman branch clearly has a problem with management and employee hiring/training. Friday afternoon, I recommended BJ's to my relatives that I was visiting in Norman. I now feel bad about that decision. I entered the restaurant with my husband, sister that I was visiting, and grandmother.  We had 2 different waitresses which was odd but okay. The first waitress was unfriendly when she took our drink orders (we politely ordered water because it was mid-afternoon and a family outing) . After that, she abandoned our table.  The second waitress that took over was perfect until the check came. She accidentally handed us someone else's check which should not have been a huge problem but she made it one. My elderly grandmother was treating us all to dinner and did not notice that the amount was different than expected, so she left $20 cash to cover the amount on the check and $10 for a tip. The waitress came back and picked up the check and snapped at us ""You didn't give us the right amount. I gave you the wrong check!"" I answered for my grandmother who seemed confused by her tone and said, ""No problem. What do we owe?""  The waitress must have been mentally slow, because she continued to repeat that we had the wrong check in a louder voice and then gave us the right check. Why would you argue and snap at a customer who just said your mistake was no problem?!?  Anyways, we immediately added more cash which still included a decent tip despite her rudeness because we assumed she was just having a bad day. After that, a very long period of time passed by (longer than we spent eating our food) and the waitress repeatedly passed the table without picking up the check. This is when we FINALLY lost our patience. I even waived at her once and she made eye contact. She only appeared to have 1 other table. Finally, after waiting longer, my husband went to the bar to break the extra cash so that we could leave her exact change with no tip and finally leave. There was no reason for this type of service. We ordered our food and drinks immediately, didn't even ask for anything extra, and just wanted to pay and leave. My husband and I run a business and would never treat customers this way. Now we have a horrible impression of both the residents of Norman, Oklahoma and the local branch of BJ's. Next time I see my sister and grandmother from Oklahoma, I will insist that they visit us in Austin, TX where people are properly trained, have common sense, and are polite to their customers. At least our BJ's is a pleasant place to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-norman?start=60
