Misty S.,"Sumter, SC",2,3,3,5.0,12/28/2017,"Will was absolutely fantastic! I can not believe what an amazing experience this turned into! It started out with a great server who was nice but our drinks were not good! Not even in the slightest. So we flagged Will down and let him know the situation. He was amazing and fixed the drinks himself and brought them back and waited until we tried them, they were phenomenal! That being said one of the girls in our party didn't like her drink because she is particular on the alcohol flavor and he took it as a challenge to find her something amazing... first try, NAILED IT! He is absolutely fantastic and made sure we were taken care of and that we had drinks in our hand. He is a fantastic asset to the restaurant and because of him we ended up staying quite a while and racking up a good bill. He made us feel welcomed and cared for! Absolutely amazing! We will be back time and time again! Hold onto the good staff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-little-rock-2
Paul D.,"Houston, TX",205,710,16,3.0,12/24/2017,"Traveling to the family for Christmas, I usually end up stopping in Little Rock.  This time was more of necessity because of the weather.  When in the area, I try to explore either the downtown area or one of the breweries that are always popping up.  As a huge storm was passing through, I was only able to check out some of the chains around the hotel.  BJ's was just down the block. I am no stranger to this brewpub franchise as it has been open in Houston for years.  Saint Arnold use to contract brew for all the Texas locations, and many states beyond.  I know SA has basically cut that out all together, and as this is a relatively new location, I doubt any of the offerings here were ever from SA, and I don't know who has taken up the contract stuff now? Anyway, like most in the franchise, a long bar, plenty of TV's, and plenty of seating spread out.  All in that comfortable chain vibe, that is pretty predictable.  Lots of beer options, from their own ""house"" beers to a pretty good list of regional and local crafts.  Actually, pretty comparable to the Saucer downtown, and way better than I remember the chain having. Their own beer options range in all styles.  Some I like, the Porter is very good, and a one off Barrel Aged Stout is pretty solid as well.  I was not very impressed with their Anniversary Grand Cru, being a 10% imperial wit, and that just seems like overkill for a style I should be able to come back to again and again.  Like most breweries, you will find something you like and something you don't. The food menu is huge, at over 20 pages.  For the chain as a hole, I never really found the food to be that great.  Though filling and well priced for what it is.  The Prim Rib Dip was OK, I would have like actual horseradish instead of a ranch like sauce with a vague hint of the pungent root.   The bartenders are great.  They were all on top of things, able to give recommendations if need be, and food coming out quick and hot.  All in all, a good chain, that will do when nothing else is viable.  I would rather check out more local stuff, but nothing wrong with this comfortable spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-little-rock-2
Patricia J.,"Frisco, TX",560,424,5957,4.0,11/26/2017,"Great service, clean restaurant and nice atmosphere. We started with the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts. They are so tasty, the lightly spread sauce is just the perfect combination for this delicious dessert! I love the fact that they are light and crispy (just the way I like it).  We shared the NEW ENLIGHTENED SPICY PEANUT CHICKEN WITH SOBA NOODLES. I Highly recommend it! This entree is so tasty, but it does have a kick to it. We split it, not A huge portion but it is shareable.  We also had the BJ's Strawberry Beignet with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, The Bread does NOT taste like a beignet at all, it's more of a sopapia taste. Also they do not add strawberries (as advertised), it's more of a strawberry sauce. Wouldn't order this dessert again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-little-rock-2

Chloenator M.,"Austin, AR",18,149,349,2.0,12/10/2017,I have tried to give this place a 4th try and I just keep getting disappointed. Service sucks. Food was ok. Pricey for the servings you get. The chips were very greasy. It looked like they were dipped in oil and put on the plate. The wings were not very meaty. The burger was the only good thing we had. The queso was subpar.

They burned my moms Brussels sprouts the first but brought them out the second time correctly z .

Craig B.,"St. Louis, MO",0,12,,4.0,9/18/2017,"This is a decent chain restaurant.  Lots of options for vegetarians - they have salads, pizza, and all of their burgers can be subbed for a veggie patty.  Imagine tgi Fridays but a little nicer.  Gluten free pizza was good - although a little overpriced.

They probably have the widest variety of food to choose from of any restaurant I've ever been to. Their house beers are a great and do yourself a favor and save room for desert. Their Pizookie's are ridiculously good!!! Another high note of this place is the atmosphere and the space.

Matt B.,"Little Rock, AR",21,61,15,2.0,10/9/2017,"Well, I can see how this one has a cumulative 3 star rating as of today. It's not good. I had the lemon thyme chicken. The chicken was very sodium-y. The brussel sprouts that came in the sauce were so hard I couldn't even cut through them. Entire dish tasted like it came out of a bag. Service is not that great, our server NEVER once came back to do drink refills or to check on us except to drop off the final ticket. The entire menu here seems forced, like some corporate chef seems to think more ingredients in a dish will make it better. Some dishes seem yucky just on the menu when reading their ingredients that don't complement each other. I might come back here for drinks--but food? No way, buster. Verdict : 2.5 stars.

John M.,"Birmingham, AL",1,18,1,1.0,7/23/2017,"My wife and I are from out of state and just came through for a couple of days to celebrate our anniversary.  Tonight we went to the BJ's in North Little Rock.  I've been eating at various locations since around 2009 but my wife had never been to BJ's before or even heard of it until today.  She ordered a mini pizza with two toppings, I ordered a small with a couple of changes made to the toppings listed on the menu.  My order was not complicated--take off two of the toppings listed and substitute two other ones--and please bake it well done. Our pizzas were brought out in a reasonable amount of time, and my wife absolutely loved hers.  I, however, could not eat mine because it was covered with one of the toppings I specifically stated that I did not want.  I pointed it out to the server and he said that he told the kitchen staff at least twice that I did not want any of that topping.  He sent the pizza back and asked them to make me another one.  The manager came out to the table and also apologized, which we appreciated.  But then we waited and waited and waited and waited.  My wife had long since finished her meal (and she is a slow eater) while I sat there waiting for my food to arrive.  When it finally did arrive, over an hour after we sat down, it was made correctly.  However, while the incorrect pizza had a generous amount of pesto sauce on it that was clearly visible, the corrected pizza had almost none at all. I ate my pizza and then waited for the server to bring me the check.  As someone who eats out far more regularly than I eat at home, I am used to having at least some sort of compensation offered when the restaurant makes a mistake on their end.  Not necessarily my item for free, but at least a discount for the wait, or a free dessert.  Something to let me know they are sorry and genuinely care about my business.  The only thing they did for me was to correct a mistake on the bill where I saw that I was overcharged (charging me for extra toppings rather than substituting them for other toppings left off). My wife also posted a negative review of our experience just over an hour ago (while we were still seated at the table).  By the time we got back to our hotel the manager had replied to her review with an apology and a request for her to call, as well as an invitation for us to return so she could make it right.  While it was nice of her to do that, why did she wait for a negative review to be published on Yelp before doing something?  She knew enough about the problem to come and apologize when I initially sent the pizza back.  The apology was nice, but it doesn't take away from the fact that we had to spend far too much time in the restaurant due to their mistake.  If she's going to offer something, why not offer it while we're still there?  Does she not care about customer satisfaction unless the customer goes out of the way to publicly criticize the service? As I stated at the beginning of my review, we are from out of state and don't live here.  We don't have time to come back to eat again before we go home.  And a gift card will be useless because I don't know of any BJ's locations in our state.  Please read the note I left on the receipt.  We had no complaints about the server himself.  He deserved a better tip than the one I left.  But I think that our wait deserved at least a $5 discount, which we were not offered, and so I would suggest you give him the $5 to make up for the low tip.  If you do that then we will be satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-little-rock-2
Brad V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,7,1,3.0,10/16/2017,"I've been to Bj's in pittsburgh and love it. Here not so much. The burger was just a burger, nothing special.

Monday was $6 brew house burgers (which is my go to) however when I got my bill it was the standard $8.25. Bartender wasn't the friendliest even though I told her I was from out of town...and i was the only person at the bar. Never introduced herself or ever asked if my food was ok.

Blake R.,"Conway, AR",69,218,213,2.0,9/21/2016,So this experience was a little disappointing.  Server was new and a little slow. Ordered sweet tea but instead I received tea made with salt instead of sugar.  The avocado roll appetizer was not good at all. Flavors didn't really make sense.  Ordered the mahi and shrimp south beach plate.  Was ok but drowning in watery tomato sauce...  Only thing that was on point was the cold beer.

Isabel T.,"Nashville, TN",115,5,2,4.0,4/1/2017,"First of all, let me start out by saying I am the sort of person who goes to a sports bar and orders healthy food. This place has PLENTY of options. I ordered the quinoa bowl with spinach and chicken. It was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend's parents adored their food as well - one of them got the lemon thyme chicken, the other another quinoa bowl. Both raved about the flavor, and tried to figure out the ingredients to recreate at home.  Only knocking a star off because the service was pretty slow. It probably took about 25 min to get food.

Beth C.,"Buckeye, AZ",43,247,234,2.0,7/6/2016,"We have a wonderful BJ's back in Peoria, Arizona, and this place was such a stark contrast, I feel embarrassed for the chain. However, we came here because we had just departed the airport, wanted to avoid downtown, and we felt BJ's had a reliable menu. Yeah. Service was terrible. Our server would literally jog by about every 20 minutes and snap, ""Do you need anything?"" and not wait for an answer. Mind you, this was 2pm in the afternoon! A big party was seated near us but otherwise it was pretty empty. Our water was never refilled, though she did bark at my husband to see if he needed more beer. At that point, after about 40 minutes, we knew we just wanted our food and a quick escape. I ordered the ahi salad, my ""reliable favorite."" It was the worst ahi salad I have ever had. The lettuce had little flavor despite generous oil dressing. [Edited to clarify.] The wasabi dabs were tiny. It really peeved me that the avocado adornment for the salad consisted of two chunks about the size of my thumbnail. The ahi was okay and it didn't make me sick, so there is that. My husband had the meat piadina with fries. The fries were good, but the piadinia was decidedly meh. It was wrapped into a tighter style like a taquito, not the fold shown in the picture, and everything fell apart in a goopy mess. Our son had plain tortilla chips, what we always ask for my BJ's, and they brought out a tiny bowl. Editing to add: I was contacted by management (see comment below) and I am very impressed by how they addressed the concerns in my review. Much respect to them for their quick response. I really hope this was a case where my family visited this location when the server and kitchen were having a seriously off day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-little-rock-2?start=20

Greeted at the door, sat promptly and then William B came by to ask about drinks. He took our drink order, then brought them back and took the rest of our order. A couple of issues arose, first saw something in my wife's drink. He promptly returned with a fresh drink. Also, apparently there was a rather large group of wing eaters as they had run out of the Nashville cherry chipotle sauce. He came out and asked for me to replace it. As I wasn't worried about it I ordered the prime rib dip. William B brought me the wings too, I was surprised by this and said he didn't have to bring the dip too.

Shannon H.,"Sherwood, AR",0,5,,1.0,10/23/2017,"Disappointed in our visit yesterday. A couple months ago we swore off BJ's restaurant because it is a time warp. The service is always incredibly slow, a 1 hour lunch turns into two hours or more. Yesterday we went for lunch at 1 pm. We ordered our drinks 3 waters, 1 mimosa and a child's sprite. We got 1 water, the mimosa and a sprite. My husband ordered the gumbo and my daughter and I ordered mini pizzas. When our food arrived we did not have any silverware, the guy that delivered the food said he would go get some. He never came back, I had to walk around the restaurant looking for a server or silverware.... no one was available on the floor nor was there a hostess to help (there were several people waiting at the front door to be seated). I spot our waitress coming out of the kitchen and she comes over to the table. I tell her we need silverware and she immediately says oh your pizzas wrong takes it and walks off..... mind you I didn't complain about my pizza....and we still need silverware. She comes back from the kitchen (after what I am assuming is the entire kitchen staff poking and prodding my pizza, gross) with my now cold pizza, no silverware. She's complaining about how she has been irritated with the kitchen staff all day (again she complained about the pizza not me).  After we finish our lunch she finally realizes that our one glass of water is empty and goes to get 3 glasses of ice water. When she arrives back at the table all three full glasses of ice water get dumped directly on top of me and my pizza. I understand that accidents happen, but I did not get a table visit from the manager, did not get a towel to dry my soaking clothes off and was not even given another pizza since my was swimming in water.  I have worked in the restaurant industry before and will NEVER return to BJs. I understand mistakes happen but not one single person that worked at BJ's cared that a ton of water and ice was dumped all over me and my food which I had planned on taking to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-little-rock-2?start=20

I like the numerous choices on the menu, and have never had a problem at my home location.  Today my brother and I were looking for a place nearby for a late lunch, and decided to give BJ's another chance. Once again, the experience was unsatisfactory starting with our drink order. The waitress dropped his first drink. When the replacement was delivered it was incorrect, and was finally delivered to the table on the third attempt. I ordered an entree salad that was not prepared as described on the menu, and, in addition, was missing some ingredients. The waitress returned the salad to the kitchen to be prepared properly. Of course my brother continued to eat his meal while I waited for a new salad. In the end I was required to have my food prepared ""to go"" because it took so long. I had problems with waitstaff and food the last time I was here. I was hoping it had improved over time, and was disappointed.

I switch between Tatanka Stout and the Nutty Brunette. I do try their seasonal beers as well and find most of their beers to be well made. Their food has always been pretty good to me, their menu is a little too thick for my taste (Need to separate the food and drink menus in my opinion).  The service though mostly adequate, can be a little slow, even in the slow times. They have never been rude, or disrespectful in my presence.

The full rack is worth it but the half rack doesn't need to be that high. Same with some other menu items. Overall you have to come here!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-little-rock-2?start=20

Gary B.,"Little Rock, AR",0,14,,1.0,11/2/2016,"The food was decent and the menu has a nice variety but the service was awful.   First it took a long time to seat our party even though the restaurant was not full.  Then, our waitress was not attentive.  It took forever for our order to be taken and then she did not come back to check on refills or to give us the opportunity to order more drinks.  I had to flag her down to order another beer. I was the only one in my party who decided to order desert.  When I did flag her down (again) to place the order, within a matter of a few minutes, she brought checks for the table with no explanation or saying ""no rush.""  We took it as her telling us to ""leave.""  I changed my order to a take out order, we left and will not be back.

She then proceeded to bring the iPad which she didn't know how to use or was u willing to try because we weren't in her area.

Dan S.,"Godfrey, IL",0,2,6,4.0,8/22/2015,"Who said there is no such thing as a free lunch? I was passing through North Little Rock, Arkansas and I came across a restaurant that I couldn't remember ever seeing before: BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. So decided to stop for lunch. My first observation was the number of vehicles in the parking lot. It seemed extremely busy (must be good). When I walked up to the front door I was greeted outside by a host. He informed me that the restaurant was not officially opened to the public yet and that the guests were all on an invitation list (that helps to explain just how busy the restaurant was). He then told me that if I was willing to sit at the bar that I would be more than welcome to have lunch there. That was perfect considering that is exactly what I was planning on doing. I bellied up to the bar and was immediately met by one of the several bartenders. She began by telling me that the restaurant was having a ""soft opening"" and that the meal would be complementary. All of my economics professors were wrong. There is such a thing as a free lunch. The menu that was presented to me was limited; however, I didn't care because it had a number of pasta dishes on it. The bartender offered me a hefeweizen, but I regrettably declined and ordered an iced tea instead. My iced tea came moments later and I then ordered my free lunch. I decided to have Cajun Pasta. The bartender asked if I wanted chicken or shrimp - I chose shrimp. She then asked if I wanted the shrimp grilled or blackened - I chose blackened. Who knew there would be so many questions? The dish also came with a salad - I chose a house salad with Italian dressing.    The salad arrived in less than 5 minutes. The greens were fresh, crisp, and cool. The dressing was vinaigrette-based and I believe it had grated parmesan cheese in it. I liked the dressing a lot. And while the house salad was fairly basic, it was much better than what you get at many restaurants for a house salad. And the quantity was just right . . . not too much or too little. The Cajun Blackened Shrimp Pasta arrived a few minutes after I had finished my salad (a picture of the dish is attached). Therefore, the timing between the courses was very good. The pasta was linguine with a tomato based Cajun sauce that had tomato chunks and finely diced onions and green bell pepper. There was also a white cheese sprinkled over the top of the pasta (probably shredded mozzarella). There was enough cheese either on top or within the sauce that it gave the dish a very nice ""cheesy"" taste. I enjoyed the taste of the dish very much. It was slightly spicy, but not overwhelming. I only have two criticisms: the first is the chunks of tomatoes (I'm not a fan of chunks of tomatoes) and the second is that the shrimp were only average sized (I would have been impressed if the shrimp would have been larger). All in all, it was a nice lunch . . . and it was FREE. If it wouldn't have been free it would have cost $16.25 before tax. The cost included the salad, pasta, and iced tea. By today's standards I don't think that is a bad price for the product that I received.  This was obviously a new restaurant (they are still conducting ""soft openings"" in order to train the staff). Therefore, the restaurant is very clean and very new looking. I have attached a couple additional pictures that show the bar and the dining area.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant. The service was very fast (but not too fast) and extremely friendly. In addition, the staff was very capable of describing the items on the menu in detail. I look forward to trying this restaurant after it is formally opened on Monday, August 24, 2015 so I can see the entire menu and imbibe in the numerous craft ales that are on tap. I will definitely have lunch or dinner here the next time I am in North Little Rock.

Jenny P.,"Mililani, HI",54,47,51,3.0,5/15/2016,"I'm giving this place 3 stars for the benefit of the doubt, because I feel like this place has great food, but maybe my husband and I ordered the wrong things. It was our first time here, and we were excited to try the deep dish pizza and ahi poke. We're from Hawaii, and my husband, like many other locals loves fish-especially poke.  The poke was disappointing. The fish was not fresh and it was a very small serving. It was served with some kind of wonton chips or something...we both didn't care for it. He didn't even finish the fish. The pizza was especially disappointing. We ordered a small, and I'm glad we did. It looked shriveled up and dry in the ""deep dish pan"". What we disliked about it was the fact that they didn't use marinara/pizza sauce on the pizza. Instead, there were chunky, diced tomatoes-and not very many of them. This made the pizza even more dry. It was basically OK pan pizza dough topped with toppings and no sauce. There wasn't even a lot of cheese either. Domino's pan pizza tastes way better than BJ's deep dish pizza :/ The only thing my husband and I thought was good was the clam chowder. We'll still eat here again and get different menu items.

I usually get the California chicken club (Great Sandwich) but I decided to switch it up and I ordered the Triple Decker sandwich. The description and the pic of the sandwich is what lured me in ""Sliced turkey, roast beef, ham, cheddar and swiss cheese, tomato and lettuce drizzled with Italian dressing, piled high on a hoagie roll, finished with mayonnaise and mustard and topped with dill pickles.""  The sandwich is way over priced for the quantity and quality of the sandwich. When I tell you the sandwich came out stone cold I mean there might have been a layer of frost on the cheese. It was so cold I couldn't eat my other half of my sandwich, I took it home and warmed it up in the microwave. I think I'm going to go back to my old sandwich of choice when I go there.

I ordered the sirloin with a baked potato and house salad as my sides. The salad wasn't much more than lettuce and croutons with a scant bit of ranch dressing. The baked potato was just barely done enough and came with nothing except for two small cups of butter and sour cream on the side. As for the steak itself, it was cooked perfectly to the medium rare I asked for. Despite that, it was still extremely bland and tougher than it should have been.

The whole experience we felt unimportant because we didn't see Our server for large spans of time.  We ordered an appetizer, and when it arrived 20 minutes later it was lukewarm and inedible. Even my 10 year old son was displeased with the cheese dip. He's not typically picky, either.  55 minutes after the hostess brought us to our table our order came out, but the service staff completely forgot about the salad I ordered which usually comes before the entrée, in the rest of America, at least.  Also, my daughter's cheese burger was incorrect. All of the food was pretty tepid, as well. I don't know about you but I like HOT food and expect it to be hot when I'm paying money for it.  This was not a good experience and was thoroughly disappointed on more than one account.  I will say, I enjoyed my beer, but I like beer and appreciate a good brew house.

Ok, I'm patient. Won't take more than a minute. Nope. Finances entire meal was consumed before we even asked if I could even get my salad.

When the bartender asked if something was wrong I voiced my frustration. Bad idea. She was clearly angry. Said she would get it comped then proceeded to stay at the opposite end of the bar.

Robert T.,"Sherwood, AR",7,30,40,5.0,8/20/2015,"Popped in twice this week. They are still in a soft opening period and officially open Monday 24th August.  Large square building with 2 separated areas: main dining and bar (also with tables to dine).  Obviously this is brand new so the staff go out of their way to be friendly, hopefully this continues.  I sat at a vey large bar (see photos) that has 3 huge TV's on the wall so watching sport here is very enjoyable. There are also several other TV's on the other 3 walls for all around coverage.  I asked for a flight of beers and was presented with a menu that lays flat on the bar and has 10 of their brews all marked with brief descriptions. They placed 4oz fluted glasses on the corresponding marks and I proceeded to try them all. I love beer but I am in no way a connoisseur but they all tasted pretty good to me with several standouts: Brewhouse Blonde (light pale, 4.7% abv) which is the top seller; Oasis Amber, underrated imho (smooth, not to hoppy or bitter 4.7% abv); PM Porter which is an award winning dark ale (6.4% abv) also my wife's favourite and lastly my fave, Tatonka (imperial stout 8.5% abv).  They have a great selection of world beers on tap including Guinness, which is poured correctly, Newcastle and Stella Artois and also Diamond Bear, a local Arkansas brewery beer. There are no Buds/Millers etc on tap but they are available by the bottle. If you want a handcrafted brew that is similar to the Bud/Miller beers you should try the LightSwitch lager (3.5% abv 103 calories).  We also had the Portobello Swiss burger which was fabulous.  They also have a great wine selection (see photos) and liquor selection. For whiskey aficionados I have to point out that all their bottles have pour spouts which does affect the taste slightly but this is a policy for all BJ breweries and I can't see it changing. I had a very nice Macallan 12. We also purchased 2, 64oz growlers of the Blonde and Oasis (Sadly the Porter and Tatonka are not available in growlers).  I can't rate this BJ's location high enough and being smoke free a great alternative to Fox and Hound. This will also give Hooters across the street a run for their money.

Ian C.,"Haughton, LA",43,11,9,1.0,4/30/2016,"I don't know where to even start. Let's start with the good I guess, since that won't take long. The good:the floors weren't sticky, they have a nice draft selection, and it looked clean even though it was dark and had very low light.  The bad: let's start with service. The service we had was horrible, it started from the hostess who seemed bothered to have to stop talking to her friend and even more bothered that we didn't want to seat ourselves at the bar area. Let's move on to the waitress, Angie, because a bad hostess doesn't always mean a bad waitress or bad service all around. Angie seemed like she had no idea how to be a waitress, she was slow, confused, kept making errors, forgetting to check on us, she didn't bring the food out to our table because she was stuck hiding in a wait station. I can understand these problems when you're busy, I've been a waiter and ran a restaurant and so I know how it goes, but to act this way when you have 4 tables in a 8 table section and 3 of the 4 tables are 2 tops just doesn't make sense. After we first sat down to the table it took 20 minutes for her to even acknowledge us and take our drink order, again this could be the hostess I spoke of earlier, once she got our drink orders it took her at least 8 minutes to bring a glass of water, a dr. Pepper and a woodchuck draft. She gave us our drinks and we ordered. We ordered mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and we both ordered ribeyes for our entrées. Angie was in clear view standing at the wait station when a runner brought out our appetizer. The mozzarella sticks were decent, much better than fast food sticks but not the best I've had, and you get 10 in an order which was surprising to me. Angie hadn't moved in at least 15 minutes after our appetizer was delivered. I finished my ale and started on my Dr. Pepper, but my wife had been out of water for most of that time. When she finally stopped by our table to see if I wanted another drink, I had to stop her and let her know I didn't but my wife would love another. While she was gone for 17 minutes to get some more water, our steaks were delivered to us, again by the runner. The steaks were cooked medium rare and medium and looked appetizing. I asked for roasted asparagus and white cheddar mashed potatoes and my wife asked for roasted asparagus and steamed vegetables for our sides. The asparagus was not roasted, they seemed to be steamed. The steamed vegetables my wife received was definitely from the bottom of the bag of mixed vegetables, since she got one broccoli floret, no cauliflower pieces larger than a pea and no carrots larger than a pea. My mashed potatoes were ok, definitely not made in house and couldn't taste cheddar in them at all. The steaks were horrible, and it's a shame for a nice cut of meat. Cutting the steak with my knife I had high hopes, it felt tender and cut easily, they looked well seasoned, but unfortunately none of that was the case. I have never had a steak come to me so bland. It was cooked to medium like I asked but it was the toughest steak I've had in a very long time. They say the steaks are dry aged for at least 28 days, but the flavor did not back that up. It was a steak, but the only way you could tell was by looking at it. The burnt parts on the steak were a nice touch as well. We finished what we wanted and started waiting, about 20 minutes this time. Angie finally returned! We asked for our check as she was clearing the table and trying to sell us on dessert. We waited another 9 minutes for the check, and I know what you're saying, maybe she got more tables while we were doing all that waiting. Well she was seated 1 more table but 2 tables left. She brought the check and said ""don't worry I'm not going anywhere"" as she took a step back to wait for us to pay. We paid cash just so we didn't have to wait any longer.  The whole ordeal took us over an hour and a half, for poor service and bad food.  I didn't ask to speak to the manager because I had already seen her speaking with 2 other tables, and I believe in paying for what you get. So I paid for what I ordered and will not be bringing my business back and will warn others of this place.  All times are accurate. The times were recorded on a stopwatch on an iPhone 6.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-little-rock-2?start=60

By the time our dinner arrived we only had twenty minutes to eat. My prime rib and asparagus were not warm, they had probably been sitting out on the counter waiting for our disappearing server to pick them up. After complaining the manager gave us a fifty percent discount on two of the dinners. That was appreciated but didn't make this situation more pleasant. In addition, since we were running late we asked that the dessert that was included with our meal be served right away. It didn't arrive for quite a while and we weren't able to eat it before we had to leave. One last note, my baked potato was never served.

Peter M.,"Cabot, AR",60,42,6,5.0,9/11/2015,"My wife and I have known and loved BJ's for the last few years, so we were really excited when we saw they were building one on McCain. This location lives up to the brand we know. First, let me say that the building is really sharp. I know BJ's is a chain, so the atmosphere is a little cookie-cutter, but the actual building has nice high celings and big windows, and its just...nice. I like new, clean spaces. The food was great, as expected. We had the Carnitas Fries and Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts to start. Both were great, but a little acidic. I think the Carnitas Fries would be better with a dollop of sour cream. We shared a pizza for our entree. The deep dish was fantastic. We got half spicy Hawaiian, which was amazing, and half Mediterranean, which was a little too salty, but well-meaning. We finished with the S'Mores Pizookie (HATE the cheesy name, but that's hardly a serious issue). It can only be summed up with one word: FUGGEDDABOUTIT. You can't talk about BJ's witjout mentioning the beer. But there's not much to say. It's great, classic microbrew in a refreshing variety of styles. A beer for every taste, and they're all top notch. Service was great. Our server made some recommendations, and gave her honest opinion about the questions we asked. She was friendly, outgoing, prompt, and not too perky or upsell-hungry--everything you want in a server and nothing you don't. My wife and I like a sure thing when we go out, and BJ's is always a sure thing, and a welcome addition to this neighborhood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-little-rock-2?start=80

It was her birthday and she was on a lunch break and figured that this place ran a lot better during lunch hours. We were wrong. For the appetizers we had the spinach and artichoke dip. It was the smallest serving of dip imaginable. I literally ate maybe five chips with dip, the plate was still covered with chips when the dip was finished. I highly recommend never to get that appetizer since you have to pay even more for more dip. Then my wife's Caesar salad comes out, and it's extremely wilted and brown. (Ice berg lettuce) they replace it, the manager hovered over her shoulder as he waits to hear if it's ok and it seemed to be at first. So after eating through it, there was more wilted, brown, rotted salad. The food took forever as if they only have one chef working in an establishment that big. The food was fine this time. The previous times nothing was fine. Food, service, anything. I won't ever be going back, the only way I would is if I was drunk and wanted to keep drinking, because the beer is the only thing this ""restaurant"" has somewhat to offer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-little-rock-2?start=80
Gayle S.,"North Little Rock, AR",20,3,,2.0,8/4/2016,"We have dined at this location several times and had positive experiences. Tonight, however, we had a less than enjoyable meal. My husband ordered a ribeye with a baked potato and broccoli. He enjoyed the steak, but the potato was too cold to melt the butter. The server (who was pleasant and efficient) brought another, which she said had been tested and found to be 113 degrees, but it also was not at all hot. Once again, the butter would not melt. The ""side"" of broccoli consisted of four tiny florets that made an attractive garnish. When my husband pointed this out, the server brought more broccoli from the kitchen. I ordered chicken lettuce wraps as an entree.   The chicken filling was tasty, but the iceberg lettuce was unacceptable. I had to tear off lots of hard, colorless core from my lettuce leaves prior to eating. Iceberg is too brittle to use as a wrap. Butter lettuce would be far better. We hope that kitchen problems will be corrected, as BJ's is usually a fun place to have happy hour or an occasional meal.
