Sara W.,"Cleveland, OH",67,44,86,4.0,11/30/2017,"OK so I love beer and I love pizza, both things that BJ's has and, I think, does well. However, I've been here a few times and every time the service was slow and a bit scattered. Let me explain what happened this last time: I came here with one of my friends to have lunch before we went shopping at the mall one Sunday afternoon. The place was kind of busy but they had a lot of servers on the floor...it looked to me like each server maybe had 3 or 4 tables (I could very well be wrong here though). My friend was already waiting at our table with waters when I got there, and explained to me that our server would come back and take our drink orders once I was ready. I really don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that we waited for at least 10 minutes before she came back. When she came around, I asked her about this beer they had on special and asked if I could try it while my friend ordered a Fathead's Holly Jolly. Our server was more than happy to bring me a tasting of the special and I ordered it since it was delish! I really don't think i'm exaggerating again when I say that it was at least another 10 minutes until she came back with my drink, and at this point my friend had already finished hers. The downside to all of this is that we hadn't even ordered our food yet and we'd already been there at least 20+ minutes.  By the time we were able to order our food, we were starving and opted to each get a side salad and split a flatbread pizza...pepperoni on all of it and banana peppers on just half. BJ's is fancy and the servers are able to put in the orders on these touchscreen pads at the table so they go straight to the bar/kitchen. Now I don't know if our server put in the pizza wrong or if the kitchen just messed up but there was only pepperoni on half and banana peppers on half. Not a huge deal since I could've done without the pepperoni anyway. Now the salads: mine was a delicious garden salad that had an abundance of different veggies, while my friend ordered the caesar...it ended up being probably half the size of what mine was.  I know I could've given BJ's a 3-star rating for this experience, but I really do like their food (when it comes out right). The service is definitely on the slower side, even when they're slow (I know because I've been there when it's slow...and they're slow). I love the space of the place, especially in the summer time when the patio is open. I will definitely go back and enjoy something from their huge menu, but I will make sure to bring a little patience with me next time. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted
Gregg T.,"Cleveland, OH",29,63,33,3.0,11/21/2017,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is what I'm sure most of us have come to expect from one of these chain-type American brew houses; good, not great. If it were up to me, I would change the name to BJ's Brewhouse and Restaurant since the beers are definitely the stars of the show.  I went on a Sunday evening with my girlfriend and was later joined by a mutual friend. We say at the bar, had a couple of beers (their house IPA is really good) and dinner. The menu is too much. I chuckled to myself when the bartender said something to the effect of ""there's 120 different items on the menu, so we have something for everyone."" While I'm sure he's just towing the company line, we all know better. A large menu doesn't typically translate into great food. BJ's was no exception.  On the off chance that I was mistaken, however, I ordered the roasted shrimp Peruvian quinoa bowl. Trust me, I've been around the proverbial block a time or two, so I know better than to try to make a place something that it isn't, but I just had to see what would be served. In all honesty, it wasn't the worst ""entree"" that I've eaten in one of these types of places. The bowl came out with about a dozen shrimp piled on a bed of sauteed spinach, tomatoes and quinoa. While the dish had way too much lemon juice (or something?), and I'm sure the shrimp were frozen, and certainly overcooked, it really wasn't all that bad all things considered. I wasn't expecting a Michelin star dish or anything.  The service was friendly, the bartender attentive, and the vibe of the place was pretty good. It's a bit out of the way for me, so I don't expect to be back at time too soon, but that said, I would return, have a beer and maybe an appetizer or two. As for the rest of the menu, it's nothing out of the ordinary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted
Michael K.,"Independence, OH",0,8,,2.0,11/11/2017,Will update review ASAP but 2 times previous the pizza and salad I have been very disappointed. Why?? I have been to several BJS all good deep dish.  This place has not proofing pizza correctly. Flat flavor... Over and over.  I will try again seriously hope for better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted
Tom N.,"Brook Park, OH",12,11,1,5.0,1/10/2018,The fresh Atlantic salmon was great! Came with rice asparagus. The server was good and the place is clean. Not a huge fan of the parking area though but it is what it is.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted
Bob L.,"North Ridgeville, OH",446,372,2924,4.0,5/3/2017,"I can still remember the first experience I had at a BJ's Restaurant. It was in Arlington, Texas back in 2008. I wasn't nearly as big of an annoying beer snob back then and, more importantly, I wasn't so hung up on eating healthy food. This made BJ's a pretty damn good joint for me. My wife and I loved their pumpkin spice ale and the pizookie, c'mon, nothing that good should be legal. Anyway, fast forward to 2017, we're back in Cleveland, and we'd all but forgotten about BJ's. That is until we heard they were opening a location in North Olmsted. Gods be praised. (angelic choir, light beams). Yeah, yeah. It's a chain. We all get it. While I don't go out of my way to frequent chain restaurants, I also feel that if a chain is done right, there's nothing wrong with it. More of a good thing, right? And as far as chains go, BJ's is about as polished a concept as you're likely to find. Big menu, good beer, clean and modern design. We stopped in at this location around 5pm on a Wednesday with mild trepidation and vague recollections of pizookie-induced pancreatic spasms. We were also aware of everyone's complaints about wait times, so our expectations were managed accordingly. If you've never had a BJ's experience, one of the first things you'll probably notice is the sheer size of the place. It's pretty damn big. I hadn't noticed so much in Texas because, well, because everything in Texas is freakin' big, but in tiny Great Northern plaza, BJ's is a monolithic structure of epic proportions. It still has that new restaurant smell. We were greeted by a group of smiling young ladies as soon as we entered. We were told it'd be about 30 minutes our so. A quick assessment of the surroundings and we spied seats at the bar. Wait averted. BTW, the guy working the bar was a consummate professional. Service industry folks that take pride in their job and exude confidence and friendliness are a rarity. Celebrate (and tip well) when you encounter them. Our beers were always filled, our plates cleared toot sweet, and waters without asking. Overall, service was excellent. The beer. While it's not really brewed on site at each location (they own 6 breweries in 5 states) it is really tasty, expertly brewed and styled more toward the middle of the bell curve. They've got styles to suite just about every taste - pilsner, wit, stout, IPA, pale ale, hefeweizen - and they do seasonal and limited run beers like the aforementioned pumpkin ale. I've had just about every beer they brew and they are all solid. Annoying beer geeks may knock 'em, but seriously, I have no complaints in the libation department. Besides, they've won multiple Great American Beer Festival awards so they've gotta be doing something right. The menu here is sizeable but well laid out and organized with beautiful photography. It's like it has been scientifically designed to appeal to just about everyone and, lo and behold, they've even got ""enlightened favorites"" living happily next door to the usual, more indulgent suspects. Really, it all looks and sounds great, so you'll have trouble deciding. If it were in any way possible, I'd love to try everything. We had a pizookie in our sights, so we tried to eat conservatively. Here's a rundown of our selections: Twisted BLT Salad: Probably the most disappointing dish of the meal. Baby spinach, diced tomatoes and bleu cheese crumbles tossed in honey sriracha vinaigrette and topped with smoked bacon and chopped hard-boiled egg. It tasted OK, it just wasn't tossed, stingy on the dressing, and the goodies seemed in short supply. Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts: Tossed in the same/similar slightly sweet & spicy dressing as the Twisted BLT Salad, most of the sprouts were cooked properly, a nice char throughout. Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms: Mini bellas stuffed with spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, red onions, herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Yum. These poppable apps were delicious. The lemon pesto sauce really brightened them up. Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl: I know. Way too healthy. The chicken was roasted perfectly, a nice crispy, spicy crust. The quinoa was tender, well-seasoned and plentiful, but the bed of spinach was raw instead of the advertised sauteed, the mushrooms were also nearly raw, and the ratios were just off. Enlightened Roasted Maple Salmon Pita Tacos: The roasted salmon was cooked perfectly, the maple cumin glaze was tasty albeit quite sweet, and the broccoli slaw and candied pecans (more sugar) added nice textural elements. The side of seasonal bistro grains was OK - a cold salad of quinoa, black beans, tomatoes, corn and cucumber. The pita shells are also quite hefty, so I'm not really sure how ""enlightened"" this dish is. Tasty though. The Pizookie (small version, perfect for 2) - If you haven't had a Pizookie you haven't lived. Restaurants all over the country are emulating this dessert with its warm, sorta underbaked cookie underneath ice cream. BJs has mastered this treat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted

Ashley M.,"Cleveland, OH",236,349,782,4.0,3/7/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised b y this place.  I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants. But, I was literally about to eat my arm and I had never heard of this place so, we decided to give it a shot.  So glad we did. I got the seared ahi tuna salad and it was fantastic. So packed with flavor, like seriously so many flavors I couldn't put my fork down. The tuna tasted delicious and I loved the seasoning they used. The pickled cucumbers were a crunchy delicious sweet surprise. We ordered some dessert as well. I forgot what they were called. But, we ordered 3 of them. Warm gooey cookie types. One was monkey bread with vanilla ice cream, the other two were peanut butter with vanilla and the last was salted caramel with vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips.  I have never enjoyed something as much as I enjoyed those 3 little deserts. Lol. My sister was actually laughing and saying she would like to motorboat them.

Akhilesh R.,"Westlake, OH",11,102,332,4.0,3/6/2017,"Happened to see a BJ's in Roseville and realized that this is a national chain. It was busy on a Sunday night. Seated immediately and the service was quick and efficient. The kids menu is available and the 3 items for $6.25 had a generous portion and filling for the kids.  Ultimate Long Island ice T was a concoction of various liquor with a splash of Pepsi. It was nice.  Barbacoa cauliflower tacos was very flavorful, the base was more like naan bread, this came with a quinoa based cold salad which was quite tasty. Peruvian quinoa with shrimp was a little bland however the shrimp was cooked perfectly and nicely spiced.  The menu is extensive and some items are repeated to bulken up the menu book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted
Joey W.,"Parma Heights, OH",7,20,36,4.0,7/31/2017,"Me and my buddy were meeting up at the mall for dinner but we were not sure where to go. He suggested here because they have a diverse menu, ""which can be bad and good"". After deciding to go here we started ourselves on the patio outside. We went ahead and ordered some beer which was delicious! Hefeweizen was our choice. After looking over the menu and unsure what we wanted he suggested the avocado egg rolls, my oh my how they exceeded my expectations, very delicious, flavorful with a great spicy mayo or some sort of spicy condiment inside served with a thick teriyaki hybrid dipping sauce. For our meal we both went with the same thing although it technically was not a menu item. We had ordered the chicken fried burger, but substituted with the Nashville hot chicken breast. It was topped with Monterey Jack, a fried egg, sausage gravy, tomato and avocado. It was tasty and VERY messy, however there was so much going on with this sandwich that all the flavors mashed together and nothing was too distinct. But then again we are the ones that altered our sandwiches. I will say it was filling and very tasty, just not as much flavor depth as I wanted due to so many ingredients on the sandwich.  I will say that I will be returning though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted

Drew E.,"Westlake, OH",35,29,25,2.0,8/21/2017,"Super disappointed with this branch of the chain. We visited one in Florida and had a really good experience.  Not so much at this one. Not that it affected my food but the floors were slippery like someone had left soap on them. That was the initial impression. Not the best start. The wait staff seemed pretty burnt out and they were busy. Our waiter was probably one of the best and made sure our appetizer came out on time and our drink orders were rapid. He had to go get the chili to go with our queso because the kitchen didn't put much in but he made it right.  I got a flight of beers and it was good. Wife's mixed beverage was overpriced and weak.  Entrees were a big disappointment. Seared ahi tuna salad was half-heartedly slapped in a bowl and presentation looked like something I could have done at home. Tuna was chewy in several places and wasabi crust was not evenly distributed. I ordered this dish because I had it once before and it was awesome...not so much here. Greens were not rinsed well and led to an overall disappointing meal. Pizza was average, piadina was average...average average average.  When shelling out $100 plus for a family dinner, there are 10 other places in the immediate area I would recommend over this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted
Andy E.,"Glen Allen, VA",8,285,66,4.0,3/17/2017,"This is my new favorite brew pub in Olmsted. Great beer and great food.  They offer their own beer (they make a killer hefeweissen) as well as other popular microbrews and national brands. The food menu is extensive - with everything from pub grub to salads to Asian dishes to ribs to sandwiches to steak...and the list goes on. During my recent visits I enjoyed the fish tacos and the spicy Asian peanut noodle dish with chicken. Both were outstanding and paired perfectly with my hefe.  The decor is classy, the bar area is large with plenty of seating, and there are a bunch of wide screen TVs showing whatever sporting event is on at the time.

I had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. They were a good size (you get 2 per order) and had lots of flavor. It was served with a side of grains (rice, red quinoa, cous cous maybe?, cherries?) It was different, but very good. Nothing bland about this meal! My iced tea was fresh and I was content with the price. My friends also seemed happy with their Ahi (Tuna) Poke Bowl and Artichoke Tavern pizza. A stand-out appetizer: The Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts. Wow. So delicious. Crispy and spicy and flavorful! Our server was a riot. Very attentive, loved her job, tried hard to sell us on the downloadable app and pazookies and very, um, present. I think what I didn't love was the menu. It was way too much to look at and decide from. Some menu options were repeated which just unnecessarily bulked up the heavy book.

Kerry A.,"Lakewood, OH",86,106,92,5.0,12/30/2016,"BJ's Brewhouse is exactly the type of place that this area needs. Located right in front of a mall, all you usually see here are chain restaurants that all feel the same. BJ's is different though. With a huge menu and a great selection of beers, you really can't go wrong here!       I have heard a lot of hype about this place recently, as it just opened, so I had to try it for myself. Being in front of a mall, parking was a nightmare. I drove around and turned around 3 times in mall traffic before I finally gave up and made my own parking spot. Once we got inside, the place was decently crowded but we were seated right away.       There is plenty of seating inside, an outdoor patio for warmer weather, and a decent sized bar. The atmosphere is very comfortable and what you might expect from a brewhouse. The hosts and our server were all very friendly, so no complaints there. While we were eating, food runners came up to us two times with food that wasn't ours (before we ordered, just meant for another table). I chalk this up to just opening and serves not yet having the hang of the table numbering. Nothing major.       As for food, they have pretty much anything you could want. We started with the spinach artichoke dip which was delicious. It came with tortilla chips and was exactly what I wanted. My mom and I both ordered a soup and salad combo, with tomato basil soup in a bread bowl (2.75ish surcharge). The soup was delicious and the bread bowl was amazing. The top of it was toasted and tasted like garlic bread. On the side, I got a Caesar salad and my mom got the wedge salad. Both were very good.       They have a great selection of house brewed beers, as well as cocktails and many other drinks. I went for their house brewed IPA and was very pleased. It was very smooth and went well with the food I was eating.

Chris K.,"North Olmsted, OH",75,67,12,2.0,9/16/2017,"Not my first visit here, but it's time for a review. First visit, shortly after they opened was fine. Each subsequent visit has gotten worse. Today was the icing on the cake.  In for a very late (3 pm) lunch. Not very many patrons, plenty of wait staff. Seated for several minutes before the server came to our table. That's as good as the visit got. Lukewarm cheese sticks with about a tablespoon of marinara. We asked politely for more marinara, and my wife ordered a specialty tea. When the tea came, the glass was maybe 3/4 full. It was a basic iced herbal tea, and my wife wanted sugar. Okay, we'll ask when the additional marinara comes. Nope. No sign of marinara ten minutes later. No sugar (or salt and or pepper) at the table. Twenty minutes after ordering, we still haven't seen our main course, two hard-to-prepare salads. My wife was trying to be patient so we waited. Good thing, since our server was chilling against an empty table for at least ten minutes while we were waiting. It was apparently the thing to do. I like bucking the system, though. We asked for the manager. When we asked for our check, he apologized and covered our cold appetizer but didn't really seem surprised.  Every aspect of this visit was miserable. With ample dining choices in the area, we may have visited for our last time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=20
Rob H.,"North Olmsted, OH",4,56,,1.0,7/3/2017,"Update: I can now officially say I am completely disappointed by this place. The case of BJ's is why I generally hold off judgement of a place until some months pass and their true colors come out. We went there on their burger night and they simply could not do anything but char my burger after two attempts I said I'd just get something else. Third attempt mahi mahi tacos. Guess what that was overcooked too. This place just kind of is not great and is way over priced for what you get. It is unlikely I'll be back.  The place has exciting sounds and visuals. The server we had was wonderful and generally seemed to care about how much we enjoyed our experience. I do however echo some of the sentiments of other reviewers. The menu is huge which is good for choice, but you know all that stuff isn't made fresh. Also, it is a little pricey the ""Bj's"" brew i had was nearly six bucks. The food was ok. Overall I think it is an ok place. I am glad to have another option close by.  Just visited again and got a ""sweet baby Jesus beer 7.95 WHAT? Get out of here. The beer prices are jut insane and at least part of the reason I am not a regular. I will say I respect their desire to make things right.

Like he actually wanted to be our server.  The food was pretty good. Not great.  Second visit was pretty terrible. Our waitress was obviously just having an off day, and I get that. Food took 45 mins. They were not that busy. I know how long it takes to make some chicken tenders with fries, boneless buffalo wings and a salad. It's much less than 45 mins. The fact that my food was cold makes me think it was the waitress and not the kitchen, but who knows.  Overall I wouldn't choose this place as my first choice.

Checked on us throughout the meal without being intrusive. Genuinely kind person!!! It's a busy place  to be sure but the staff treat you Well!  The salmon was nicely seasoned and grilled right.

Kristen C.,"Avon Lake, OH",6,79,4,5.0,1/12/2017,"I love love love BJ's!! I've frequented this chain both in Florida and Columbus, OH and I've never been disappointed. The North Olmsted location delivers just as well! The ambiance of the location is fantastic - it's a large and usually crowded restaurant but I never find it overly noisy, which is nice.  The menu is extensive and I have tried many things including the jumbo meatballs and spaghetti, hickory brisket and bacon cheeseburger (SO good), almost all of their chicken dishes, and their steaks. I've not had a bad meal here yet. I HIGHLY recommend the chips and salsa appetizer. Their waitstaff is friendly and personable and their prices are reasonable. I'll agree with other reviewers who say that the wait for food to come out can be lengthy. I don't find it overly long to the point that I get annoyed but this certainly isn't a restaurant that you should choose if you're in a hurry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=20
Jess F.,"Strongsville, OH",41,154,454,4.0,1/29/2017,"We have been a huge fan of the BJ's franchise in Columbus and despite the negative Yelp reviews were looking forward to trying this location too. We arrived on Saturday night at 6pm and the place was packed and we were told about an hour to 90 minutes for a table for 2.  Pretty typical when you don't make reservations on a Saturday.  Luckily while we were grabbing drinks from the bar 2 seats opened up.  We ordered avocado egg rolls and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, a  crispy jalapeno burger, and parmesan crusted chicken.  After about 20 minutes our dinners showed up and we told the food runner we were still waiting on our appetizers - a few minutes later our appetizers arrived.  The bartender came over to apologize and then sent the manager over to apologize - and ended up  taking off one of the appetizers from our bill which I thought was a nice way to handle the situation. The stuffed mushrooms were just Ok - probably a 2 star item.  They were bland and no particular flavor stood out.  The avocado egg rolls were fantastic & I would recommend.  I loved the crispy jalapeno burger - 5 stars - (Fried jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, Baja sauce, red onions, tomatoes, lettuce and cilantro on a toasted bun) and it was cooked to perfection.  The parmesan crusted chicken - 5 stars - (Topped with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli). We also tried the skinny margarita (5 stars) and you can't go wrong with any of their in house craft beers.  If you download the app and join their loyalty program you receive a free pizookie! I would recommend downloading the app to add your name to the waitlist before arriving to the restaurant.  We never got the text that our table was ready until we were in the car on the ride home - thankfully those 2 spots opened up at the bar or we would've been waiting the full 90 minutes. Side note for those with gluten sensitivities - I did notice many items were gluten free & they did offer gluten free buns for $1 up charge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=20

The food was average at best.   Pasta, for some reason had a stalk of celery in it, however the flavor was ok Hamburger had virtually no flavor at all Fish and Chips were ok California Chicken club was average, although the chicken was a little dry On the plus side - French fries were amazing, we got a pizookie which was delicious and the server (I wish I remembered her name) was excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=20

The service was pretty good, I cannot remember our servers name, but she was pretty attentive with drinks and quickly taking our order. When my salad arrived, I did have to go to the hostess to get silverware for myself and my family. When we did receive our silverware, I'm assuming they were waiting on them to get out of the dryer/dishwasher because all of our napkins were damp.  BUT the food was awesome. I had the California Chicken Club and LOVED it. A couple of my family members had the salmon quinoa bowl & really enjoyed it, and another couple had the bacon burger! The BEST food were hands down the French Fries. In mine and my husbands opinion...the best fries we've EVER had! Can't wait to be back, just for the fries!

I'm betting if they don't close due to lawsuits within a year, they'll be lucky. The food was bland and greasy. My boyfriend tried a burger which was oily from top to bottom- even the lettuce was soggy. I had the chicken club and did not like the garlic bread, which was also soggy upon arrival at the table.

Xela N.,"North Olmsted, OH",7,207,,4.0,12/13/2016,"Let's face it.  It's hard to impress 'the average Joe' these days when it comes to new dining establishments.  There is so much competition, especially when it comes to overpriced (my opinion) national chains, thus expectations are ultra high to begin with.  Really, all people want is good quality, good tasting food at fair prices.  My wife and I had been driving by the BJ's location as it was being built, wondering what kind of restaurant would be replacing 'Smokey Bones'.  We stopped by on opening day, and frankly left unimpressed.  My wife had the Lemon Thyme Chicken, which she thought was OK, but the veggies and rice were very bland in taste.  I had the Ahi Poke as my appetizer, which was gross to say the least.  The 'poke sauce' tasted rather anemic, and the tuna was bland and flavorless, and seemed to be a 'lower grade'.  It's consistency was 'way off' as well, being very soft and limp.  Which makes me wonder if it was actually tuna at all I was eating, or some other cheap seafood filler masquerading as real tuna.  At this point, I thought to myself, well at least my medium deep dish pizza is going to taste great.  Wrong!  The dough was way too chewy in spots, and clearly not baked or crispy enough.  The cheese and tomato sauce tasted processed and bland as well.  I've tasted much better frozen pizzas, truth be told!  I took the pizza home anyway, and tried re-baking it, and added my own mozzarella cheese and spices.  It tasted much better.  At least the Pizookie desserts tasted great.  On the plus side, the interior layout is top notch, with a nice mix of bar, tables, and booths.  Our server was excellent too, as was the manager, who listened to my concerns, and ultimately 'made things right'.  I will probably give this place another chance in the future, but not anytime soon. 2/21/17 We returned to this location, and gave BJ's another chance, and it turned out much better.  The shrimp tacos and calamari were good, and our server was amazing!  My guests and I had a great time, and everyone left happy.  All I can say is that if you've ever had a bad experience at a new place, go back again and give them another chance at a later date.  Oftentimes, it takes a few weeks for a new place to find it's mojo, and reach optimal service and potential.  I hereby change my original 2 star review to 4.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=60

Food and drinks arrived quickly, and we had an enjoyable experience. In terms of the beer - I tried both of their seasonals - Grand Cru and Bourbon Barrel Stout. I enjoyed both, but the Bourbon Barrel was the superior of the two, IMO. They also brew their own NA root beer, and it's got a very flavorful blend of seasonings.  In terms of food - We did salads and the pizza. Yes, the menu's a mile thick, but if you go here and it's not for pizza, you've made a poor choice. Their pizzas are excellent.

Just crust with tomatoes.  The Caesar salad for $10.50 was pitiful. A couple handfuls of romaine, a few croutons and a very light sprinkle of cheese. The boneless wings were soggy, and food was cold. Apparently, no one figured out that the baked potato takes longer to make than the sandwiches and fries. Everything was done, but we had to wait 10 mins for the potato.

We had pretty much counted this one out after our food took forever, however once it did we changed our mind.  We ordered a burger for me (no bun, declined the gf free bun) and he got the pulled pork. I will say that was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. It was a bit greasy, but I was not ordering a burger to be healthy anyway.

Then we ordered jambalaya and the rice was hard. We ordered avocado egg rolls and they were not cooked right and came out soggy. We ordered calamari and thank god they were cooked perfectly. The waiter then comes with another Long Island and said he added more alcohol which still didn't fix the flavor of this premium drink. They didn't come to check in or ask how the food was so we wasted $70 on food we didn't eat and drinks we could not bare to consume. What a horrible experience!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=80
Michaela C.,"Cleveland, OH",0,6,1,2.0,12/28/2016,"I wanted to like them but nothing went right. The worst is when you give management feedback and they don't respond. Our beer was flat from the get go. Upon acknowledgement of that they have us new beers. But later we realized we were charged for the noncarbonated beers. When we complained our server told us there was nothing she could do. We attempted to escalate but it would have been the third time we spoke with management so there was no point in waiting. Our food took forever. We had the kids so we ordered theirs first, shortly after our app and then our food. Their food looked and was excellent hence the 2 stars. Wish I could give more on that account. Our food forever took another 30 mins for a super basic/cold queso app. And then another 40 mins after that for our food, a California flatbread and spicy pig tavern pizza. His actually looked great. Mine had more brown avocado than green. It was just frustrating to try and explain to management the slow service and food and just have them stare with no response. Seems like super young and inexperienced staff all throughout from management, servers and kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=80
Tim S.,"Elyria, OH",25,3,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Have eaten as BJ's locations throughout the country. Was happy to see one coming in nearby. Made trek out there today. Was a disaster in every way. From the hostesses to the servers, no one presented themselves in a customer-friendly way. After more than an hour in the restaurant, I finally received my food...only to be brought something that wasn't what was ordered. Given my positive experience with other BJ's, I'll give them another chance. But if I had to lay odds today, I'd bet this location closes within a year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=80
Cathy F.,"Berea, OH",0,1,,5.0,1/3/2017,"We were excited to see BJ's was finally open.  We called ahead so we wouldn't have to wait to long, which worked out great.  We had the wasabi Brussel Sprouts - which was excellent    My daughter had the Seared Ahi Tuna salad which she truly enjoyed, I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken - which was delicious.  My husband really enjoyed the Chicken Club Sandwich and fries.  They both enjoyed a few of the craft beers.   Service was great.  It was a little higher priced but much better quality food than Applebee's.  Loved the extensive menu and are definitely planning to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=80
Melodie W.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",2,10,1,3.0,3/22/2017,"Went to eat here with my husband and another couple. The wife had the pepperoni extreme flat bread. She said it didn't have as much pepperoni as the location in Canton. The husband had the blacken salmon and he said it was good. My husband had the brisket burger and fries. He said it was good. I had the triple decker sandwich with fries. The sandwich was to have Italian dressing on it. It was on the hoagie bread but not on the meat. Very dry. The fries I had were very good. I asked for water with lots of ice and that is what I received. The restaurant didn't seem crowded, we were seated right away. But we had to park almost to the exit driveway to Brookpark  Rd. There was nothing outstanding about the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=80
Gee W.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",2,5,,3.0,3/22/2017,"We were a party of 4 having a 6:30 pm dinner (Wednesday).  Tomato bisque soup was very good with subtle flavor.  Our meals: bacon brisket burger, pizza, blacken salmon and triple deck sandwich were all good and tasty, but nothing really special to rave about.  The bbq sauce on the burger was very good. The pictures at the top are just what our meals looked like when served so I think they represent very closely the look of all the meals served.   Tho the restaurant was not crowded, as others have noted, finding a parking spot within 3 aisles of either side of BJ's is near impossible with the mall entrances so close.  We finally found a spot near the shopping center entrance on brkpk rd.   Our server must be new as she couldn't answer some of our questions on drink prices or menu items. Food was presented in a reasonable time after we placed our order.  The menu is a tome about the size of war and peace...and took us a bit to look it over. Meanwhile our server kept coming back every couple of minutes asking if we were ready to order.  I guess she thought we'd been here before and would know what they offered. So in my opinion, this is just another chain restaurant in the area to choose from.  Nothing special other than the beer selection to set it apart from other restaurants in the mall area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=80

Amanda O.,"Rocky River, OH",0,2,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Bruh. This place is awful. We made reservations and still waited a half hour. When we sat down the waiter was friendly and took our drink orders. 15 minutes later, he showed up with HALF of our table's order. (We had 4 people) so we told him and he said he would have them ""right away!"" 15 more minutes later, he shows up with the remaining two drinks and then takes our orders. I ordered some bacon guacamole burger and asked that they do not include the jalapeños. My beer tasted like someone had diluted it with water and my friends drink didn't even have the alcohol in it. Our food arrived 40 minutes after we ordered. My burger wasn't that great and it had the damn jalapeños on it. When we went to pay for our meal, we paid cash and the server never brought us back our change ASSUMING the remainder of the cash was his tip (which was the plan but it was rude to take ALL of it.) we won't be back.

Walleye W.,"Put-in-Bay, OH",0,42,1,4.0,7/20/2017,"Very good service from our server, Dino. Very nice and on top of all our needs. Our bill was 38 bucks and change, which I did not feel was overpriced for all that for all we ordered. That included a beer each, a shared app, two sandwiches and a shared pizookie. ( Which was worth a return in itself). All of our food was good, service was great and our waters were never allowed to get empty. Both of our beers were BJ brands and were both well done. I can't really say anything that was bad but I can't say it was a solid 5 star.

We got a table.  The server was lovely and very obliging.  The food was fantastic - we were there on half off pizza night.  However my daughter ordered a salad with dressing on the side and it took over 20 minutes from when the salad arrived to when the dressing arrived.  Disappointing.  As much as we like the food, I would think twice before putting myself in a situation with such bad bar service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-north-olmsted?start=40

She always made sure our drinks were filled, had more ranch then we needed without us even asking, and her personality is why I chose 5 stars. She was super personable and always had a smile on her face. The food was really good too. Their wings were incredible and one of our friends had the prime rib and ate every bit of it.

Krystal T.,"Lorain, OH",28,5,4,1.0,5/11/2017,"If this place could get 0 stars it sure would. I have been to a few bjs that have been incredible both food and service.   Today was some of he worst service I have had in a very long time. I went there today with a girlfriend and my 2 daughters. We wanted to honor our girls day tradition of getting to have dessert before our meal.  We sat down in a not to busy restaurant only to wait 15 mins to even have our server show up to great us. That is where she left one small drink napkin. We ordered our drinks and our dessert. She returned with drinks and quickly left to tend to the table of four business men behind us. Our dessert came and we only hand the spoons given to us to eat with and a single tinny napkin to clean two small children with. Then my friend decided that she wanted a berry hibiscus tea which I guess just came out today. The tea was totally forgotten then when we asked about it there was major attitude like she never ordered it, but it was the server who forgot about it The sunset peach and the berry tea were so bland with little to no flavor. We got our appetizer and still had no napkins or silverware. By the time we finally got them our avocado egg rolls were very cold. Food came and was missing things or had things we requested not to. The Mediterranean chicken pita tacos were ordered with on onion and came with them. My salad the BBQ chicken chopped salad came with no dressing at all. We finally got the manager and asked for her to help correct the wrongs. We told her that we were sorry to bother her but our server did not seam to be able to attend to us. The manager said sorry and that was it. By then I was just ready to leave. The server came with the check. She had to swipe the card at the table and leave to retrieve our paper to sign. She was gone like 5 mins. The manager stopped once more and asked how it was we responded with ok I guess. And she left again. We left and stopped the manager once more on our way out. We told her that the food was ok and the service was the worst since our server wanted to ignore us and pay attention to the businessmen. She said well come back and see me again ask for me then as an after thought gave me her name. I can tell you that im not rushing back.
