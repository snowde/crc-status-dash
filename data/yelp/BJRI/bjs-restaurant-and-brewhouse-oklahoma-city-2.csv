Matt M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",432,1107,252,4.0,12/13/2017,"Here I am, a solid foe of chain restaurants in general, writing a good (albeit not five star) review for a (!!!) chain restaurant. Oy. I went here with one of my nieces after she kept begging me to stop in here with her. (I have a hard, guncly crust, but -- at the end of the day -- this guncle is essentially a big old softie.) I was impressed by the selection of craft beers and hard ciders, and ended up settling on a Jalapeño Burger with fries. (My niece had her usual nachos, and THAT made her as happy as a little pig in shit.) I've heard some less than pleasant anecdotes about this restaurant; it's true. (Chain restaurants can, after all, be spotty depending upon location, franchisee, management in general, et cetera.) And, to be candid, I can't imagine coming here often. (I'd rather support locally owned places. Period.) That said, I had a very, very nice little meal here, and so I can't complain. One thing -- and this IS important: Someone needs to send a memo out to all the employees here that being on your cell phone during work hours is simply NOT acceptable. Period. I saw about a third of the staff here fiddling with their phones in lieu of working. THAT, my friend, is simply not acceptable. (Were I the manager here, I'd ban all cell phones, iPads, and other personal electronic devices during work hours. No exceptions.) OK, grumpy old man rant over here now. I'm hungry for a Jalapeño Burger and hard cider.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2
Jess M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",25,78,96,2.0,11/15/2017,"Have you ever watched 'Kitchen Nightmares'? If you haven't, it's a show where Michelin Star Chef Gordon Ramsay goes to struggling restaurants to see what they're doing wrong and tries to fix them. A lot of times he'll see that the kitchen is disgusting or the food is rancid and expired. BJ's, I'm sure, doesn't have any of those problems, but Chef Ramsay would have an issue with the size of the menu. After looking at their menu online, I counted ~150 items. I understand wanting to have something for everyone, but 150 seems bonkers. It's a bit overwhelming to have to thumb through 25 pages of food that all seem like they would taste fine. Luckily, I didn't have to think very hard about what to eat. On Mondays, BJ's offers their large Deep Dish Pizzas at half price, so my brothers and I chose that.  We decided to do half Chicken Bacon Ranch and half Gourmet Five Meat. The Chicken Bacon Ranch was easily the better of the two that we chose, but still nothing amazing. The Gourmet Five Meat, while meaty, was pretty dry. We asked for extra sauce, but it was still pretty parched. Also, BJ's Deep Dish Pizza is nothing close to actual Deep Dish Pizza. Deep dish is supposed to be more like a pizza lasagna/casserole. BJ's pizza more closely resembles Pizza Hut's Pan Pizza. In fact, it pretty much has the same topping and crust ratio (2/3 of the pizza is just crust) and tastes almost identical. If we had shown up on any other day and bought the pizza for full price, I would be disgruntled. Since it was half off, I'm slightly gruntled.  Despite all of the bad things I have to say about their pizza, their Pizookies are delicious! Sure, they may be over 1000 calories each, but who cares? If you have the room for it, go for it!  In conclusion, avoid the pizza, eat the Pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2

Tracy M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",25,50,42,3.0,9/10/2017,"I rarely write an ""unhappy customer"" review because I genuinely believe that everyone deserves a second chance, but this particular BJ's location needs help in the service side. The food is always good but they never staff enough servers. Again, I believe that from time to time, people and businesses will fail you but this is the fourth time I've been to this particular BJ's and the service has been poor. Not due to unfriendly servers by any means but by the nature of management not scheduling enough staff. I would hate to see this location suffer long term but hopefully the management can figure out a better solution. There's zero reasons why any guest should wait more than 3-5 minutes before being greeted. There's zero reasons why any guest should have empty water glasses for 10+ minutes. Like I said, this pretty much is the norm every time I frequent this place. Boo. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2

I ordered a sirloin steak and asparagus.  I should have taken a picture.  The asparagus was over cooked as was the steak.  The steak was seared way too much.

Seemed to take forever to get drinks, to order, and to check out. Then the food...not sure if they changed their chefs and/or recipes but the food was subpar. The Buffalo pizza was very dough-y and the Buffalo sauce wasn't tangy or spicy. The flavored tea was not sweetened like we were told either. I don't think we will be back.

I really do mean that in the best possible way. I am never enraptured by the gastronomic pleasures of the Pizzookie, but the food is always more than edible, the service is always quick, and anyone can find something to enjoy on the Tolstoy-inspired 10,000-page menu.

Tania S.,"New York, NY",282,70,52,5.0,3/21/2017,"Been on a strict diet lately and have been trying to find places with some diet friendly options.  Luckily, this location has a section in their menu dedicated to ""lighter options."" I'm usually skeptical on trying these options since foods on these menus aren't the speciality of the restaurant.  I was surprised on how flavorful my entree was! I ordered grilled chipotle chicken with brown rice and black beans. Wow. For being on a diet, this hit the spot. The flavors were more than what I expected from BJs. My food ended up being better than what we both ordered.  Good job BJs!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2
Shay B.,"Edmond, OK",127,532,396,3.0,9/4/2016,"When it comes to appeasing my large extended family on where to eat, BJ's usually does the trick. After all, their menu is practically a novella with how extensive it is. There's truly something for everyone here.  Last time I came, we were a hefty crew of 13, which the BJ's staff handled well (especially when you throw on the antics of my dad and his siblings bringing out the sibling in each other...). Both drinks and food came quickly, which was much appreciated.   Do note that the portions for BJ's meals are H U G E. I ordered the Santa Fe salad, and it was practically 3 salads in one. If you have a small appetite, definitely go splitsies. Which I also recommend for their delicious, signature dessert: the Pizookie. It's a cookie cake topped with ice cream and quite tasty.  Overall, I'll take BJ's over some of the other places that get veto'd in the dining discussion!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2
Tim S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",43,184,266,4.0,3/27/2016,"Slight downgrade for old faithful.  Started out the meal with the fried calamari appetizer.  The Aoili sauce and marinara dipping sauce that came with it was really good and helped a lot.  I didn't feel the calamari was breaded or cooked very well, there were actually 3 or 4 pieces that barely had any breading at all on them.   My wife and I could be a little spoiled though, both having had fresh fried calamari though in Seattle and Alaska.   Guess I should've expected this from a restaurant in Oklahoma.  Also, ordered the New California Redwood punch.  I'm a bourbon guy, so the alcohol listed was one of my favorites, woodford reserve.  I could barely taste the bourbon, though which was a turnoff.  So I would suggest a little more woodford, less fruit punch, but the mint leaves were a nice addition.  It was a perfect evening for their outdoor seating and despite being somewhat busy the waiter was on top of everything.  My Italian penne w/ Cajun shrimp was superb though and came with a garlic knot.  Overall, I'm just bumping then down 1 star since this is the first time I've been slightly disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2

Service was also excellent.  I was able to have 3 small tastes of beers before choosing which pint I wanted. They have 4oz tasters for $2 each as well. I ordered their Hopmaster IPA and enjoyed it. For an appetizer, I was really excited to see they have poke. Poke is incredibly commonplace in Hawaii and I don't see it often here on the mainland. I was very pleased with how tasty BJs was. (For those unfamiliar, poke is marinated raw fish, kinda similar to sashimi.) I ordered a burger for dinner and it was prepped beautifully. I ordered it medium and it came out medium!

Chad K.,"Potomac Falls, VA",133,218,267,3.0,9/17/2016,"Some coworkers and I stopped by for dinner here a few days ago. It was a great choice because it offered a wide variety of food selection to make everyone in the large group happy. The inside reminds me of a manly cheesecake factory. Almost like a cheesecake factory and a sports bar had a baby, this restaurant being the result. It is decorated in a contemporary traditional decor that is trendy and comfortable. The staff we encountered at this restaurant were great! They are very friendly and quick (which in Oklahoma isn't really the norm). We started off with drinks and they have a wide variety of beers to choose from as well as specialty drinks. Some of my coworkers got stouts and they enjoyed them thoroughly, and I got a martini and it was made almost perfect (minus some points for  the lack of blue cheese olives). Drinks were brought back quick and we placed our order. I went with the Cobb salad and it was so good! The avocado ranch dressing was a little disappointing but I made due with some oil and vinegar.  Overall I would recommend this to a group of people going out for dinner with different palates. I wouldn't go here with my significant other unless it was the only option, mainly because it is nothing majorly special.

We were ready to order our food and looked over to see our waitress, the bartender and another waitress at the bar. They were on their cell phones. We got our waitresses attention and placed our orders. The food came and looked good. My wife ordered the jalapeño hamburger and fries.  It was very good. I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was far from good. It was greasy and tasteless. I was very disappointed.  My grandson ordered the grilled cheese sandwich.

John O.,"Little Rock, AR",94,17,28,1.0,7/28/2015,I ordered a 1 topping pizza and Initially it looked good until my second slice when I noticed the severe lack of cheese all over the pizza. What I thought was extra pepperoni turned out to be patches of sauce with no visible cheese. Needless to say this was by far the worst pizza I've ever had. You'd think for $19 they wouldn't be so damn stingy on the cheese. If I felt like waiting another 30 minutes for another pizza I totally would have brought it to their attention.

Mary K.,"Tallahassee, FL",118,175,152,2.0,3/14/2015,"I tried BJ's for the first time nearly five years ago and came out unimpressed. Tonight was my second time, and the experience was not any better.  I ordered the Santa Fe Salad, which comes with romaine lettuce, blackened chicken, red onions, fire‑roasted red bell peppers, jack and cheddar cheese, avocado, corn, diced tomatoes, crispy tortilla strips, and Santa Fe dressing. I asked for the red onions to be left out. I suppose to the chef, that meant leave almost everything out because all I got was the lettuce, cheese, a few tortilla strips, and the dressing. No red bell peppers. No tomatoes. No avocado. No corn. And most importantly, no chicken. When the waiter came round again, I explained that almost everything that the salad was supposed to have was not in my salad. His response? ""Oh."" Instead of asking for a new one, I simply asked for what I wanted most - the chicken and the avocado brought out to me so I could add it into the salad. It came out within a few minutes by someone else entirely. I added it in and the salad tasted decent after that, even though it was still missing a few items. There was never an apology offered, not even an offer to discount the price of the salad at all for basically just giving me a plate of lettuce. Did they really think I was going to be ok with being charged about $13 for lettuce and that I wouldn't notice they left out quite a bit of what was supposed to be included? Stuck around for dessert which was the baked beignet. The flavor itself was good with the strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and cinnamon sugar. Unfortunately, the beignet itself was very tough and we had to pretty much saw at it with a knife just to get a piece. I couldn't remember what it was about BJ's that kept me away for so long.

Jeff M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",423,586,1161,3.0,4/30/2013,"When people say they really like BJ's Chicago deep-dish pizzas, what they actually mean is they really like (overly starchy and doughy) bread, with some toppings for the sake of color. What they have at BJ's isn't pizza. It's a way to carbo-load prior to a marathon. The Moroccan Spiced Salmon (or something) was not entirely terrible. Well, that makes me sound snooty; it was actually pretty good. The roasted red pepper sauce was kind of watery, and not spicy enough for my tastes (remedied by liberal amounts of red pepper flakes), but there were bites where I was reminded of my mother's cooking (she's not Moroccan, but some of the spices used in Moroccan food is similar). The pickled cucumbers on top were quite yum, and there was the occasional crunch of toasted almonds, which was surprisingly pleasant. But it was something like $13.00-14.00. Not at all worth that price point.  Personal pizza + Moroccan Spiced Salmon (+ a drink maybe?) = $32.00+ Worth it? Sort of? Maybe? Not really. I probably won't be back for a very long time, but if/when I do, I'd definitely get the Salmon again. If you're a big fan of of overpriced and sub-par pizza, small portions, or shopping at the Outlet Shoppes nearby, you'll probably love BJ's pizza. Okay, that time I meant to sound snooty.

Brandon R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",29,39,8,2.0,7/4/2015,"I have tried this location several times now, I intentionally waited to write a review. I kept making excuses for them as to why the service is so horrible. However, I've run out of excuses and have come to the conclusion it's nothing more than just bad service.  Let me start by saying the menu is great. Everything I have ever ordered tastes wonderful. The signature pizzas are obviously great. The steaks are good. Nothing to write home about but not disappointing either. The calamari appetizer is a must order and for dessert the pizzookie (spelling?) is amazing. We have never been disappointed with the food. Now to the service... This is consistently the worst service I've had and I'm including fast food! They are extremely slow with beer orders which is crazy considering the fact that they claim to be a brew house. I can only imagine how much money they have lost from not being faster. We finish a beer and order another and it can be 10-15 min before the next round arrives. The wait staff is very friendly and it may not be their fault maybe the bar staff is where the problem lies. We had my birthday dinner there recently and there we approximately 16 people in our group. Several people had not been before and they told me even though the food was good they wouldn't be back. After the meal we were sitting waiting for the aforementioned pizzookie we had ordered. After 20 min it became apparent our server had forgotten about them. I don't know how else you could explain it taking longer to make a pizza and deliver to my door than it took them to put a scoop of ice cream on a cookie and walk it across the room to our table. Our party was there for approximately 2 1/2 hours and we were only served 3 beers in that time.  You can look back at all my previous reviews and tell I'm not a person that typically writes bad reviews. I truly wish the service was so much better. This location is very convenient and the food and beer are great. I just don't think I can suffer through the poor service again.

Was worried they would not like me bringing my own dessert for a birthday party, hostess asked if she could take my homemade cupcakes I brought to the cooler while we ate & bring them out whenever we are ready. I thought that was very nice they they accommodated our party. Everything was on point! Everyone's meals, from salad to pizza to pasta tasted amazing. !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=20
Darci M.,"Mustang, OK",56,73,20,4.0,5/3/2014,"This was our first visit to BJ's. Liked the ambiance, it was noisy but we could carry on a conversation without problem. The Jeremiah Margarita was quite tasty. We has the calamari and artichokes. They were both tasty but the calamari wins the race. I had mahi mahi tacos which were quite good as well. My other half had the Tuscan Chicken Limon pasta which he enjoyed well enough not to share, although he does watch his salt and was concerned it was a bit too salty. We split the dessert which name escapes me. It was pricey but no more so than say Applebee's or Chilis however the food was better and tastier. I would happily return to BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=20
Laurel S.,"Shawnee, KS",61,405,3,2.0,4/14/2014,"I was sad after this visit.  I had gone to a BJs in Dallas and really liked it but this visit was just so-so.  Our food was not great, the service was poor.  In general a pretty bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=20
Makenna S.,"Mustang, OK",31,19,16,5.0,3/15/2015,"Love this place! The food is delicious. The jambalaya is exceptional and they are very accommodating to your meal preferences. The wait staff is quick and makes sure that drinks are constantly refilled. Only suggestion: if you're going to have a casual, quiet sit down meal, make sure you aren't seated in the bar section... It can get pretty loud on game days (game days meaning if any sports event is on the TV)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=40
Tom H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",6,65,,4.0,6/25/2015,For a chain this place is really good. Great beer selections and endless food options. They have a great selection of small to huge portions.

Annie D.,"Honolulu, HI",6,9,,5.0,9/7/2015,"Every BJ's I have ever gone to has been on POINT!  I just ordered some carnitas fries and they were SO good!  The meat was tender and the fries were fresh.  I'm really commenting  though because our waitress, her name was Krista or Kristen I can't remember (it was Friday, 4 Sept) was phenomenal!  Probably the best service I've had in years.  She was attentive, friendly and genuine.  I drank SO much water but she was always there to keep my glass full.  Also, she came around just enough and only at the appropriate times.  I'm not too picky about that but I can recognize when someone is so good at their job that they pick up on those cues.  Great restaurant, great food, great staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=40
Iris T.,"Grand Prairie, TX",131,79,19,3.0,7/1/2015,Food was ok  but what was quite annoying was that they insisted on seating people across from each other even though there is plenty of seating. I obviously requested to sit in a different seat when she tried to seat me across from this other couple. But they left and the new arrivals were seated directly across from me. They had two empty seating booths in front of them and in back of them and so did I and we didn't even have the same server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=40

Our server was friendly and helpful, and the food came fairly fast and was good. The food wasn't amazing, but it was what was expected. We ordered the happy hour spinach artichoke dip, avocado eggrolls, four of the mini deep-dish pizzas, strawberry mojitos and white peach margaritas. Birthday girl also chose a red velvet pizookie. The drinks were great and the dessert was really good too, especially the ice cream.

Alexis L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,25,,4.0,7/24/2015,"I try and avoid chains at all costs, but BJ's is one of my exceptions.  I love their in house brewed rootbeer, cream soda & orange cream soda in the frosty mugs.  And the pizookies are the best-cookies in a pizza pan with ice cream.  Lots of menu options that will please anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=40
Billie W.,"Yukon, OK",9,10,1,5.0,9/6/2015,"This place has the best menu! Great tasting food that is only prepared after it is ordered, so don't get in a hurry for your food, because it is well worth the wait! Always great friendly service.

Eric F.,"Oklahoma City, OK",9,48,2,3.0,5/9/2013,"We've had BJ's before in Norman, OK.  Still get some immature laughs every time we discuss the place, what can I say? Wife and I went with our 20mo old daughter for my birthday.  The entry is kinda cool with it's big revolving door.  The prices are a bit higher than I would like to pay for the amount and quality of food, but not absurd by any means.  The Calamari was delicious, and felt like a nice size for an appetizer, though I am personally not a fan of the chewy tentacles.  For those wondering: yes the calamari at BJ's includes little creepy tentacles as well as the body meat I love so much. House salad was pretty generic.  What can you really expect though?  It's just a salad.  Wife and kid seemed pleased enough with it. We split a 9"" (small) deep dish ""Great White"" pizza.  (basically chicken alfredo pizza)  The chicken was amazing, though I kinda wish there had been more on it.  In fact all the toppings were delicious.  The crust had a hint of crispy-cheese flavor around the edge which I liked, and it was light enough that I didn't feel bloated after eating 2-3 pieces.  I can see why the other reviewer seemed less than keen on it, as it wasn't perfect by any means.   Since it was my birthday they brought out a mini pazzoki (sp?) which is really just a delicious and hot cookie in a tin with a scoop of ice cream on top.  It was incredible, and I could feel it going straight to my love handles.  To be honest, I feel like the last time I went to the BJ in Norman it was a birthday as well, and I could have sworn the pazzoki was much bigger, but who can really complain about free birthday chow? Sadly being new the place still has a few kinks to work out, especially with the small book they call a menu full of beers and food.  I had asked our waitress about ""flavored teas"" because I love a sweet fruity iced tea, and she only knew about the icky raspberry tea from the fountain (I can't stand the stuff, doesn't taste anything like tea to me). I noticed later that they have ""mocktails"" which are fruity drinks without booze in them, including a Peach tea, and a Blackberry tea.  Both made with Monin syrup mixed into tea.  I've had these before and love them, but having already resorted to ""just water,"" the $3 price tag for said teas seemed unnecessary. Fun place with decent enough food.  Seemed ideal for parties of 2-4, with the potential to push some tables together for larger parties.  Also they had advertisements saying ""call ahead and skip the wait"" or something like that, so it appears you can make tentative reservations if you like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=40
Vinh N.,"Bedford, MA",40,199,1003,3.0,7/7/2013,"I seldom go to fancy places and this place looks pretty fancy to me.  The place has a nice atmosphere but it seems a bit dark.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like this or not.  I ordered the Supreme Pizza and it was around $20 which I thought was a bit expensive.  The pizza was alright but it didn't have enough sauce for my liking.  Especially for leftover, it was dry as a brick.  The Mac & Cheese was average. They made it too fancy and I thought that ruined it.  They crumbled some cheap gold fishes to try and make it look sophisticated (I hate gold fishes, too dry!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=40
Lauren W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",28,30,1,4.0,5/14/2013,"I really think BJ's deserves 4 stars, for a few reasons. No matter which BJ's I go to, the service is great and the food tastes exacty the same.

Ashley S.,"Austin, TX",101,24,191,5.0,5/29/2013,I'm a fanatic. Anyone who knows me knows that if they ask where do I want to go eat I'm saying BJ's! My rewards card has earned me a lot of free food because I spend a boatload there. They have a great drink menu for starters. I'mnot a big beer person but they have a wide selection so I can take my beer drinking friends there and not get ugly looks all night because they only have domestics. The Very Berry Margarita is my favorite. I'm really glad they come out with the small appetizer plates because I kill the Feta and Watermelon Salad and the Chicken Wontons. The menu is huge but not overwhelming. I've been to places where they have so much that you can't even figure out where to start but for some reason their menu just flows and it's never hard.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-oklahoma-city-2?start=40
Joseph G.,"East Meadow, NY",9,10,,3.0,7/20/2014,Good food as usual. Service was NOT A+. Wait for a server and drinks was extremely long.
