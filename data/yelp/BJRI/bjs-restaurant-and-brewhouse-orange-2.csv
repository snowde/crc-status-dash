Paul G.,"Santa Ana, CA",694,456,2499,4.0,8/15/2017,BJ's pizza never fails to please.  They probably have the best sit down restaurant pizza that one can buy.  Service here is pretty decent if you sit near the bar or the surrounding area.  Been to BJ's many times and have never been disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=20
Michael M.,"Anaheim Resort, Anaheim, CA",3075,75,594,4.0,12/20/2017,"I've been to numerous BJ's restaurants dotted all around Northern Orange County. The one in Huntington Beach is my favorite on Beach Boulevard as far as overall ambience and location are concerned. Nice little quiet stream to the right of the restaurant is tranquil. Patio seating is desirable here. Hospitable greeters, upbeat and friendly service. Good craft ales (I like the amber the best), and good supply of food entrees to satisfy your cravings. My favorite hot sandwich is the Roast Beef Dip au jus! Thin pizzas here are well seasoned and have a great flavor. Usually not too loud unless it's football Sunday. I never turn down an offer to go to BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=20
Nicole G.,"Anaheim, CA",210,110,511,3.0,4/14/2017,"I remember BJ's being a very cool place to go to maybe it's just this location but it was kind of disappointing, my friend and I came for happy hour and when we asked about certain drinks she didn't know if they were shot or martinis. Which is fine, but when I asked if she could find out she said no. Which I found really odd. The restaurant is the really nice looking cool atmosphere.  I ended  up getting a drink that was for banana pudding martini and it was really good. We also ordered an appetizer sampler. It really just tasted like a bunch of frozen food warm up and put on a plate. I remember really liking the avocado rolls but they were not very tasty and quite disappointing this visit.  I used to be a major BJ's fan and I don't know if the quality just suffering now or just this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=20
Zac C.,"Anaheim Resort, Orange, CA",54,26,,2.0,11/20/2017,Don't come here when it's busy. It took 25 minutes to get our food. The waiter forgot about us and I had to go look for her. We waited 35 minutes for our pazooki. How long does it take to make a tiny cookie with a scoop of ice cream?!!! Finally we waited another 15 min for them to return our cards after paying. As a final slap in the face they gave us free pazooki coupons but you have to spend A MINIMUM OF $10! Outrageous. Just really poor management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=20

Anish P.,"Orange, CA",148,5,,1.0,1/1/2018,"I don't usually post reviews, but today was something else. Came in for dinner tonight, and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had anywhere. Our server initially came by about a minute after we sat down and asked if we were ready. When we asked for a few more minutes, it was more than 20min before he showed up again despite being flagged down a few times. It took another half an hour for the food.. which would usually been understandable except the place was pretty empty. The server throughout was dismissive and uninterested. With all the places around the outlets and area, will definitely give this place a pass next time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=20
Mckenna D.,"Anaheim, CA",223,158,173,3.0,1/26/2017,"I'm never 100% sold on why people always insist on bringing me here because I'm not a fan of their pizzas, like ever.  However, I am a big fan of their avocado egg rolls and their Pizookies so I guess I'll keep coming back.  Anyways, my group ordered a large pizza: half The Great White and the other half pepperoni, the brussel sprouts, and wings.  Not eating any meat I passed on the wings and dove into those brussel sprouts.   I had a slice of The Great White pizza, which is chicken alfredo on a pizza.  I picked off the chicken and it was far too rich for me.  The crust at BJ's is incredibly buttery (greasy?) and I don't really like the taste of it.  Is it supposed to be deep dish? I think so but it never sits well with me.  I only half enjoyed it when I added red pepper flakes to it.   Brussel sprouts were really good.  Fried to a crisp then topped with a honey sriracha sauce? Yes please! These are a solid crowd pleaser.  Avocado egg rolls are always a delight.  They are exactly as they sound plus a spicy cream sauce inside and topped with cilantro and coupled with a sweet/salty dipping sauce.   Of course we ended with the classic chocolate chip Pizookie. Warm cookie plus ice cream equals the perfect ending to an ok dinner.   This is a good place for a group. You'll find something on the menu, but usually everything here tastes better after a beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=20
Skylar V.,"Lakewood, CA",468,155,532,4.0,3/24/2017,"BJs off city drive is a modernized BJs that provides a great ambiance for brunch, lunch, dinner and date nights. The location is perfectly placed off the freeway inside the Orange Outlets lot. Parking can be a bit busy on weekends and during their 11am to 3pm lunch special during weekdays. BJs has a phenomenal lunch menu that is affordable, delicious, and has numerous healthy low calorie options. Their beer menu is delicious as well! Their blonde ale, red ale, and porter are my favorite beers. Personally, I have not had problems with service at this location, but I've heard some stories from friend and family that they have long wait times for order taking and getting food. They have outside patio seating, nice flat screens, and a stacked lit up bar. The bar area also has nice dining seating and I have had previous experiences sitting at the bar and it was a great experience. Overall, I'll keep returning to this location, plus it's nice because you can take a break from shopping or eat before/after seeing a movie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=20
Ivan C.,"Anaheim, CA",246,75,147,2.0,7/22/2017,"I usually don't review huge chains like this and what not...... but today I will. We went here tonight and used the BJs app to wait for our table... that worked in our favor. Once we got there our table was ready. We ordered a kids mac n cheese with fruit A small pizza: half great white and the other 5 meat. Not gonna lie I felt that our pizza was mushy and under cooked but since we WAITED like 30 min for our food, we just ate it since my 2 daughters and my gf were ""Hangry"" ahahah..... it is what it is. Our waiter was great but couldn't recall on his name... It was wasn't the service staff, I'm sure it was all the kitchen .

Ivy C.,"Garden Grove, CA",174,336,1132,3.0,1/14/2017,"BJ's is best known for their pizzas but to my surprise, I ended up like their salad and appetizers more. We ordered the 5 meats and BJ's favorite pizza which were both pretty good, but it was just that the crust was so bready and dry. The Cobb Chicken salad was tasty. I loved the dressing, avocado, and the smoky pieces of chicken.The appetizers we got - cabbage wraps and chips with artichoke dip - were also yummy. All of these were better than the pizza itself.  Our server (I think his name was Casey?) was all around great. He got us everything we needed, helped us use a coupon (Buy 1 entree, get 1 free with the purchase of 2 drinks), and hooked the birthday boy up with a complimentary pizookie. And man, oh man, was that mini white chocolate pizookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream plopped on top was DELICIOUS. I'm telling you that pizookies are not overrated at all and whether it's your birthday or not, you should still order it for dessert.  I give BJ's more of a 3.5 since although everything else was pretty good, their popular deep dish pizzas did not live up to its ""hype."" It's a good thing the pizookie did!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=20

It's fine that the rest of your menu items are delicious, but when you order the one thing that brought you to love this place, the pizza falls flat.

""Meh"" seems like a pretty good way to describe this place. The most exciting part of this place is probably the name. Honestly, it's ok... If you're hungry and tired after shopping at The Block and want to sit down somewhere to eat, this is definitely an option. The waiters don't check in on you that much so you'll be able to get some rest (shade shade shade)  As for food, you should probably get the ribs, some wings, or a burger. I actually liked the root beer chicken wings so give those a shot. Tonight I had the jambalaya which I didn't really enjoy.

Rus M.,"Anaheim, CA",56,201,1268,3.0,11/24/2016,"Dinner date with my wife while sitting at the bar.  I prefer to sit at the bar now at this location because I feel the service is a somewhat better.  Nothing against the waiters and waitresses in the dining area, but they just seemed to be bogged down with so many tables and are a bit slower. (from past experiences).  Seems like they've changed their menu a bit as well.  I've never seen Brussells sprouts before and it seems to be the new fad.  I was leary about trying them because, well, it's an item I haven't seen before and I've had amazing brussells sprouts elsewhere. So I decided to give them a try, since they were a fairly good price. Surprisingly, they were really good. The Brussels sprouts were a creamy and crunchy and toasty, like the were sauteed in butter, there was fresh grated, melted cheese over top and it was plentiful.  ( BJ'S do not change this recipe!)  My wife had the DOS Tacos Plato's. Well that's what I'm calling it, because there were two tacos on a plate and I don't remember the real name of the dish.  I think they should change it to my name instead. Haha. Anyways I digress. There were two succulent butter sautéed shrimp tacos with dressed with cabbage and onions.  A little on the small side, but it did its job.   If you're in the area and are looking for a quick bite drop in.

Thomas B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",28,8,2,1.0,11/1/2017,"This just feels bad to share. I just spent the past few hours at UCI with a friend who had surgery. I joked about seeing BJ on the way there. I've never eaten at a BJ before. On the way home I pulled in to order food to go. Nashville Hot Chicken Wings:  My wings were plain. No seasoning, not even salt. I had 3 wings (all the same) before adding tobacco. Somethings off.  Ribeye (medium) and asparagus:  after those wings I'd hope the steak was on point. My steak... again medium... was completely rare. I knew something had to be up when the hostess (she gets this star, she was great) told me my foods already done, just waiting on the asparagus. My first experience at BJ'S. I just wanted some food.

Michelle R.,"Anaheim, CA",1034,1879,9620,4.0,5/27/2016,"BJ's is a casual eatery, known for their deep dish pizzas, their beers and their pizookie. The restaurant started in Santa Ana, California and now they have locations nationwide. Over the years, their menu expanded, and added things like sandwiches and even fish n chips.  I was craving fish n chips, and stopped by the Orange location, at the Outlets of Orange. Our server was bubbly, and started off with drinks. I didn't come for the famous pizzas because wanted the fish n chips, and I also knew we had to end our meal with a pizookie, a dessert that is a combination of a pizza and cookie (hence, pizookie) The fish n chips were nice, hot and fresh, and their skinny fries (the width of a match stick) was so addicting.  Some people may like ""regular"" fries like McDonalds or the thicker fries you would get in a traditional fish n chips, but I really liked the skinny fries. After dinner, Karen and I decided to share the mini trio pizookie: 2 signature chocolate chips for each of us, and a monkey bread pizookie to share.  The chocolate chip is their original pizookie, and it wasn't until recently they added the monkey bread, which is a cinnamon bread (think cinnabun) without the icing.   Overall a good meal, and decent service.  When we left, the place was packed and the line was out the door.  Plenty of parking, and food was good, although I thought it was a bit pricey for what you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=60

Ema V.,"Fullerton, CA",43,124,72,2.0,7/17/2017,"Came here on a Tuesday during happy hour. There was open table in the bar that needed to be cleaned. So I walked over there to wait for someone to help clean it. A couple servers and a manager walked by and nothing happened. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was happy hour and you can clearly tell they were busy. Finally I made eye contact with a manager and he asked a server to come bus the table. As we were waiting for the table to get bused the server dropped a knife on my foot, which wasn't the best feeling in the world. Yeah I know you are probably thinking that I shouldn't have been so close to the table, well I wasn't, he was rapidly wiping down the table and didn't notice the knife, so it flew a couple feet over to where we were standing.  We get sat and they bring our drinks out. We order our food, and food was meh. I am totally okay with going to places if service is whatever as long as food is great. But service was meh and food was meh. I might have felt differently if we came at a slower time, but BJ's food really doesn't wow me anymore. Even their staple pizzokie, was over cooked and my ice cream was melted before it came to the table. Basically didn't have the best experience this visit and it makes me not wanna come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=60
Jonathan Q.,"Anaheim, CA",483,77,10,2.0,5/15/2017,"The first time I ever had BJ's was in Temecula, and I remember their service, the food, the atmosphere, everything about it was great. They were still figuring things out but I remember having the bar set so high and every other BJ's matched that... Until this one. I've been here three times now and honestly if it weren't for the food I'd just stop coming altogether, and for how late it's open. This last time we got seated, it took almost 10 minutes for someone to realize we hadn't been helped and it wasn't even our server. Then my drink came out, but not my friend's and there were no waters which we had ordered. Then our actual server comes out with the wrong drink for me but has the rest of the drinks, our two glasses of water and my friend's drink. Awesome, now we just wait for the food. Couple minutes pass and our food gets here and is correct and great-tasting. My friend didn't say much about the pizza other than it was good. But as for me with the Parmesan crusted chicken, it felt there was no flavor to it, as well as the cheddar mashed potatoes. Not that it was dry, just lackluster. I still ate it because I was hungry and wasn't going to order something else and wait longer, but just wish I had more of a better taste in my mouth than a full stomach of no taste. Consistently though, the service hasn't been the greatest with waiting for more than a couple minutes for a waiter to take our drinks. As well as our regular order. The food and drinks come out at a reasonable time, but given the wait time just to get a server is pretty bad. I'm not sure if it's just because of our age and nobody wants to take our table because of that, which I think is unfair, or just lack of communication. Either way, it needs to be addressed as it wasn't that busy when we had gotten in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=60

Diane T.,"Chicago, IL",4,37,,2.0,7/12/2017,"Not the greatest chain and there are plenty of reasons why. Let's start with the limited good points: lots of parking, decent beer selection Now onto the cons:  Ordered drinks, friend ordered a Patron tequila drink and when she got it she noticed that it was not Patron. The waiter then asked her if she was sure and if she had had a cocktail from Bjs before. She knows her Patron, trust me. It would've been nice if he didn't actually question what she tasted.  The quinoa side was really dry, and very unappetizing. The peanut soba noodles were extremely saucy and salty.  Ordered a clam chowder and didn't get any oyster crackers to help cut the saltiness of the chowder.  Ah well. I sound like an old grumbling pessimist, but it really wasn't that great.

Jazmin M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,12,,2.0,12/22/2017,"My boyfriend and I love Bjs. We always get the same thing when we go just because we can never get enough: boneless wings as an appetizer, half buffalo half BBQ. A mini great white pizza. Two, maybe four beers. Depends who's driving. We normally go to the HB location on beach Blvd, but we decided to stop by here after a movie a couple nights ago on a Sunday. We walk in and there's only 1 other couple waiting and we ask for a table for 2. The hostess tells us it'll be about 10 minutes. No problem. She takes our name down, or at least acts like she does. Around 15 minutes after sitting there we haven't been seated. We choose to be patient, I've been a hostess before and I know 10 minutes isn't always exactly 10 minutes. After having waited like 25 minutes another male host asks us ""are you guys waiting for a table?"" And we say yes. He asks for the name and he can't seem to find it on their list and when he asks the other hosts she just shrugs her shoulders and walks away. He then immediately seats us at at table closest to the host stand. Keep in mind that all the that tables around where were seated are empty. There's only a party of 3 next to us. The server then comes over and takes down our drink order. We order waters since we haven't decided on which beer to have. It takes her about 15 minutes to come back with the waters. By this time we're ready to order drinks and food. We always know what we want. Like I've stated earlier, we always get the same things. When our wings arrive, they hardy have any sauce on them and they're cold. They've definitely been sitting on that window for a good 10-15 min. We send them back. We don't mind them being microwaved, we just don't want cold wings. Our pizza then arrives and we're sitting on the table without sauce and with out extra plates. Our server doesn't stop by for about 10 minutes after our pizza has arrived, we've been waiting to order ranch off her and extra plates. We finally get the plates and ranch and we eat the pizza. Our wings arrive afterwards. Much better temperature and all. We then sit there, and sit and the waiter doesn't stop by at all. We then flag her down and we ask for the bill. I watch her walk over to a computer, print out something and then stare out into the distance and walk into the back of the restaurant. 10 minutes later our check finally arrives. She tells us ""thanks for waiting, I got you guys some sweet discounts for the wings coming out bad."" We look at the bill and the only discounts are for my beer and the pizza, which naturally are already discounted for us dining during happy hour. Like do you think were dumb? Lol  The hostess service was bad and the server was just plain slow. Probably not coming back to this location.

Sophia L.,"Laguna Beach, CA",256,5,,1.0,10/23/2017,"Had the worst customer service experience ever at this location. Order was taken by the server, and the food was brought out by other people. There was a problem with the food so we waited for our server to come by again-but she didn't. We were starving so ate and waited over 20 min after eating, no one showed up. We decided she may have left so went up the the waitress station to ask if we could get the check. Meanwhile-our waters were not refilled even once and our server seemed to be MIA. Finally, we saw her (for the first time since ordering our food), and she brought the check. Have no idea where she was the whole time. We wanted to order dessert but was sick of waiting so we ended up paying and leaving.

We were greeted by Whitney, who was very friendly and energetic. That was great! I ordered vodka cranberry, they make it the way I like it!'  Now for the food. It took more than 15 minutes for two appetizers to come out. Ok no big deal, we were just hungry. They were good. Now for the entrees, I ordered the roast beef sandwich no onions. I emphasized no onions 3 x!!!!. Finally our food comes and guess what onions. No big deal we told Whitney and said sorry and would take care of it. My partners burger got cold while waiting because it took 15 minutes for it to come out. During that time no manager stopped by to apologize. It made it seem like this was a norm. But my biggest pet peeve we were eating at an un prebussed table. All the dirty plates were still there. You guys need to train staff on prebussing.  Anyways, the only reason this is such a big deal is because I'm in restaurant management and my first time experience was extremely underwhelming.  Will I try it again? Yes, but not at this location.

Alexa R.,"Orange, CA",341,27,6,1.0,2/28/2017,"Honestly, I used to love Bjs because of the atmosphere, food, and service. But this location has to be the worst one open, which is sad because this is down the street from my house. My family drove 2 hours to eat at a fun place and we decided on this location because of proximity to where I live, but unfortunately this experience made my aunt's birthday not the best one. Instead of naming every detail, I rather just list them so you can just get the idea how  unpleasant our experience was. We were a party of 8, you would think they would pay more attention to how they serve a medium sized party.  1. Our drinks were always watered down with ice because our server had to be reminded 2-3 times about refills 2. Our server failed to mention that you ""cannot take out the jalepenos"" on a specific burger, and my brother didn't receive a new order burger until everyone had completed their meals. They tried to ""customize him a burger"" to fit his needs and attempted to be nice BUT ended up charging us double the price as the original burger he had ordered 3. I told the server it was my aunt's birthday and asked her to bring people/candle to sing-- she forgot and just brought out the pizookie, then went BACK to go look for a candle, then left without any regards to what I asked 4. They billed us wrong and duplicated orders on the menu 5. (This wasn't to us) But we witnessed the manager move a small family to another table as they were eating to fulfill the needs for a ""bigger party"" Basically, the food is okay. But the servers/service is very unsatisfying. Will not be coming back to this location or recommending it. We will just go to Brea Bjs instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=60

Jessica L.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",624,277,732,2.0,2/22/2017,"It really surprises me of all the bad experiences that I have had at BJs since I have moved to SoCal. You can't really go to any major shopping area or any food area without running into one. You would think this means they have their shit together.. Oi how wrong I was. I honestly only ate here because I got a coupon from the Yelp Elite event. And I still don't think it was worth it.  We came here at the tail end of brunch on a Sunday morning, about 5 minutes until it was over to be exact. We were quickly seated and the hostess was nice enough to allow for us to order off of the brunch and as well as the lunch/dinner menu. Unfortunately that is where the meal fell flat. We waited around for quite sometime before our actual waiter came over, by that time we had all decided on what we wanted to eat but for some reason he would only take our drink orders. Fine, whatever its fine.  Time droned on and then he finally came over to take our order. My sister and I ordered off the lunch menu and husband ordered from their brunch menu. With the restaurant being about 50% empty, we didn't expect for there to be such a delay in getting our food - boy were we wrong. And what made it worse is that while we were waiting our waiter didn't even bother to check on us, our cups were left unfilled as we waited. What bothered me most was the he didn't even seem to acknowledge our existence, he would casually stroll by and not make any contact  - not even a ""your food will be right with you."" When our food finally did arrive, of course most of it was wrong. My sister, who driven by her weird cravings only wanted mashed potatoes and french fries - had ordered a side of barbecue sauce when she originally ordered was missing. My husbands simple sunny side up eggs, ham and sourdough toast was completely wrong. The eggs were over hard and the toast was white.. he was content to just suck it up and eat the meal and was midway through chewing on a piece of toast (it came with 4 pieces) but miraculously our waiter decided to come check on us. We informed him of the error and without an apology he simply dismissed it saying ""oh, they must have grabbed the wrong plate."" He grabbed the plate and again the waiting commenced. Again, many times throughout our wait we saw him walk by, never once did he apologize for the delay or even acknowledge us. He came back about 10 minutes later with the exact same plate - I know this because the 3 pieces of white toast were still sitting there with the now cold ham and finally sunny side up eggs. Again no apology was given. He just set down the food and walked away.  The only redeeming thing about my experience here was my chicken soba noodles, they were delicious. The noodles were soft and delicious, chicken and vegetables were plentiful and sauce was just right.  Toward the end of the meal, I was just over it - I wanted to get out of there I was so annoyed. I presented him with my coupon and my credit card and wanted to get things done. He took the coupon and said that he couldn't run the card just yet.. Ugh.. sure? He came back with a receipt but of course it wasn't itemized so there was just no way for me to know if he actually honored my Yelp coupon.. Not wanting to waste anymore time here I ran my card and left.  Not exactly sure what is going on with BJs, their service is just horrendous - even if your food was delicious the service itself leaves a nasty taste in your mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=40

Sharon A.,"Orange County, CA",3,35,16,2.0,9/5/2017,"This is like the 3rd time I've had a bad experience at BJs and I'm not sure why I keep giving them another chance. This review is for the Curbside service.  Every single time I've come here, they pretty much tell me that they'll come out when they can because they're busy, which is fine but please communicate that so I'm not wondering what happened or if you forgot about us outside. If you offer Curbside, but can't handle the volume on a busy night, maybe you should stop offering it.  Just a suggestion.  I'm still sitting in my car as I write this review. I called and they said they will be out soon... about 15 mins later, I walked inside and no one was at the register, so I left again. Now I'm still waiting 30 mins later and still no service.   UPDATE - they finally came out 35 mins later and I closed my Yelp app and drove home.  This was on Sunday.   The time before this latest experience, the person who picked up the phone for Curbside actually said that they were no longer coming out and I could come inside to pick up my food if I wanted to (thanks, I guess).  It was about 8pm and the Curbside cut off is 9pm. I walked inside to get my order and there were 3 servers standing around at the register chit chatting. So they weren't busy, they were just lazy.  Not only were they lazy, my food order was wrong and things were missing from my bag... which I noticed when I got home.  The labels that they read to me had the correct food items on them, so I thought the food inside the container was correct.  It wasn't.  So disappointing.  The BJ's on Beach and Edinger might be super busy and further away from my home, but the service and communication have always been good, so next time I'll definitely make the drive out there before I come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=40
Heather N.,"Garden Grove, CA",123,168,164,4.0,7/19/2017,"Today my server, Karen S (as stated on the receipt), was hit and miss with my group. There were times where she was very nice and others where she gave off some bad vibes, in the manner that she spoke. I wasn't sure if it was just me but it turns out the rest of my party agreed. Other than that, the manager was awesome! He checked on us twice making sure everything was good!  My experience could have been 5 stars, but because of the bad vibes I received from time to time from my server, I docked off a star. The food was great! Everyone liked what they received (shrimp & asparagus penne, chicken club sandwich, flatbread pepperoni extreme, peanut butter & cookies n cream pizookies). The wine, on the other hand, was just disgusting. If you are adventuring into the world of alcohol, the Kim Crawford wine is just terrible and I wouldn't recommend it. Of course, this is based on preference and you might end up liking it. Just a fair warning though and it wasn't cheap! It was originally $40 but there was a 50% off wine deal making it $20, so that didn't hurt so bad. What's funny is that when my party took the bottle home, we were passing it around trying to make someone take it home because we all hated it.  I would come again.

We sat on the patio with Whitney, and she was great! We started with the big appetizer plate, which had a combo of 4 things. The boneless wings were definitely the star, so good! I also had a small tomato and mozzarella salad, which was amazing. So fresh and the perfect amount for a side salad, I'll probably get it every time now.

Leilani Laisa T.,"Anaheim, CA",461,281,1475,1.0,6/14/2016,"The service here is the worst I've received in a really long time.  I mean the WORST. I couldn't even go home without stopping to tell you that you should go eat somewhere else.  I'm in my car writing this because maybe tonight someone thought of coming here but will read this review and I'll have saved that person from spending hard earned  money at this place.  Reasons why you don't come here: 1.  The hostess took our party of 2 to a table after asking for a booth. She said 'wait here and you can move there when he's done bussing.' Then took off.  Probably could have waited until it was clear to seat us instead of making us watch the busser waiting for the head nod to come sit.  2.  15 min wait for water.   3. Ordered the avocado egg rolls-another 15 min.  When it did come,  no sauce.  Asked the waitress about the sauce and she said they ran out of sauce cups so they just didn't put it on the plate.  Amazing.  15 min wait for sauce.  4.  25 min wait for 1 pizza and 1 salad.  Salad dressing was gross and the only good thing on the plate was the chicken.  Couldn't finish it.  Pizza looked weird and was dry.  Def not the quality I'm used to at BJs 5.  Ran out of water 4 times.   6. Asked for a box for pizza and salad and waited  for awhile for just a pizza box...none for salad.  7. Pizookie took another 15min and was lukewarm 8. Check came and took 15 more minutes to run it.  Our server wasn't even the one who came to collect the credit card. We could have walked out and not paid if we wanted to but we're better than that.   9. We didn't even see our server serving other tables.  What was she doing? The restaurant was moderately busy but there were three servers in our section.  One group of 20 right next to us.  They got great service! 20 people!!! (Different server) We were 2! They got shots,  refills, boxes, and the servers had time to sing happy birthday to these people.  Our server wasn't in the chorus so wtf!?  Where was this girl? Did I make her up like fight Club? Was I giving myself bad service?? Am I Bruce Willis in the sixth sense?  10. This is unrelated to the restaurant and they had no control over this but:  there was some massive car meet tonight at the block which completely clogged all roads in the parking lot in addition to city drive all the way to the 5 fwy. Racey McVapefaces were  revving their engines and cutting people off and blocking all intersections making it very difficult to even get to BJs to get the worst service of my life.   Not sure how often this car thing happens at the block but consider it a sign from the sweet baby Jesus himself that you shouldn't come eat here.   Total we spent about 2 hours to dine here.  Think of all the things you can do in two hours.   Do those things instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=40

We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks and an appetizer. They have several beers on tap along with their own site or seven of their house brews. My wife was deciding on her drink and was taking forever as usual. The bar tender noticed her struggled and asked if he could make her something. He surveyed her likes and dislikes and came back with a concoction. She enjoyed it. The bar tender was really friendly and make good cocktails. He did the same thing for her second drink and made something completely different.  As far as the food goes we onky shared the chicken poststickers. These were decent but pricey. I think there were about 6 of them for over $10.

Kieu T.,"Irvine, CA",181,116,203,3.0,10/22/2016,"BJ's is one of those places that you go to if you want to hang out with friends, drink beer and eat something mediocre.  I come here a lot because it's a five minute drive from the hospital that I work at. We usually come after work for their happy hour which ends at 7pm. The drinks are great; they have a good assortment of beers and cocktails. Some of the appetizers are great like the wings and the calamari, but I would say the rest of the food is not that great.  I've had ever pasta dish they make; the best one is the angel hair pasta with shrimp; and it was just ok. I recently had the penne with shrimp and asparagus and it was not good at all. The pasta was undercooked and asparagus was overlooked. It had no seasoning what so ever. My friend got the steak with Brussels sprouts. He asked for medium rare and it was over cooked to medium well. The Brussels sprouts were so overlooked that it was mushy. It was also underseasoned. The other negative thing about this place is the wait to be seated. It's always so ridiculously busy that the wait is usually over and hour. We never wait though, we try to find a seat in the bar/lounge area and if there is none, we go elsewhere. It's the place is not really worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=80

We've always had GREAT service and insanely amazing waitresses. They've always been so nice to us. I went on Monday night for dinner with my best friend and boyfriend and their food is always so good. I ordered the baked ziti (always a favorite), my boyfriend got the Great White pizza (and on mondays, deep dish pizzas are half off!!) and my friend got some lemon chicken dish. We all loved our food and I ordered a Pink Cadillac and it was AMAZING. I don't really like alcohol but that was so good.  I'm sad to see such bad reviews from others.

Simon C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",240,66,108,4.0,10/16/2016,"BJ's is just one of those good feel/bar places to relax, chat, and watch football or basketball.   The reason it deserves a 4 star is because of the food and service. The quality of the service was amazing.  I never ran out of water, and I didn't need to ask for refills.  For me, that's huge.  Also the waitress was very energetic and willing to get things done for us as quickly as possible.  We ordered a BJ's special pizza and it tasted great.  However, I took off one star because the pizza was a little more on the dry side; it lacked oil.   Other than that, besides the food and service, there really isn't much that could go wrong by going to BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=80
Joseph V.,"Santa Ana, CA",57,5,2,5.0,6/23/2017,I typically come in and sit in the bar area. Whether with friends or on a lunch break. I have absolutely no complaints about this location.  On a weekend night it is very busy and there may be one or two bartenders for the whole establishment. I can see how this may be frustrating to some.  Based on the reviews I've read I feel like someone has to say something positive. It's easy to get mad and write something negative. A full bar top and a whole restaurant to make drinks for makes for a busy night for bartenders. Maybe management should consider a back bar for tables. Just my two cents.

Paula V.,"Garden Grove, CA",212,86,204,2.0,4/11/2017,"My least favorite BJ's location. I appreciate the food and relaxed ambiance that generally every BJ's Restaurant has to offer, but ever since this one opened in Orange, I feel that it hasn't been able to get on its feet.  Service has consistently been slow and confused in my experience. My parents wanted to eat here for a family dinner, and it was the general consensus that we should have eaten elsewhere. Most BJ's that I frequent have a more laid back vibe over the sports bar vibe, however this restaurant was so loud that my family and I constantly had to repeat ourselves to the waiter and to one another just to have a conversation. The service left much to be desired as my dad's beer came out before all of our waters, our food came out before the silverware, and my brother's Sierra Mist was accidentally refilled with water. I never had any particular problems with the food at this location, however my mom was quite disappointed that her steak was dry. I ordered the Peruvian Bowl with Salmon which was okay--I was satisfied. Despite the overall negative experience, our order of the Monkey Bread Pizookie saved the night. The only reason this review has two stars is because of that tasty and sweet dessert.  I visited this location the past few times out of convenience and proximity to my home, but in the future I will opt to drive to the Cerritos location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=80

Michael H.,"Buena Park, CA",7,5,2,1.0,3/21/2017,"I have not been here before nor will I ever go back! Our server was cool totally forgot his name but, a colleague and I ordered the ahi poke and the first bite was super fishy  tried to not complain and really didn't want to say anything since we were there celebrating her birthday!  She ordered the same thing and spit it out right away so it wasn't just me. The server placed our order on the fly with the kitchen so it came out super quick.   A manager came out in between that and apologized and said they were having a chef look into it and assured us our meal was going to come out quickly and asked if he could do anything for us and commented before walking away that the fish was cut fresh daily.   My husband is a professional chef in the business for going on 15 yrs now and we eat alot of fresh poke and sushi and it was either just a end of tail shit cut or just a poor quality tuna. It was not even properly cut left in long strips of scored up tuna.  We ordered the cherry glazed salmon and the spinach isreali couscous with asparagus. It was pretty good until I found a STUCK to my plate tiny black hair on the edge of my plate.   After discussing it with the people we went with we decided not to say anything else because I didn't want anyone to think to think I was complaining just to get a free meal and just post my review. This is not the topper yet!!!! You ready.................douche bag doesn't even discount our meal I mean really with your stupid comment the fish is cut fresh daily. Well guess what go tell your chef or whoever places your order if your serving raw fish make sure it's quality and/or center cut pieces.  It's okay your young and and have alot to learn. I asked our srever for the mangers name that came to speak to us and he stuttered and said one name I didn't understand and then he said Tanner it's Tanner. Either he didn't want to give up his manager's name or he didn't know it which I highly doubt.   So I left feeling nauseous and disappointed!!!

I think if you come here you really have to level set your expectations--- this is a chain restaurant that specializes in the basics ( pizza, burgers, tacos), so I don't recommend ordering  anything complex ( rib-eye steaks, ribs, etc)--- just stick to the basics.  We ordered tacos, burgers, and the kids had chicken tenders.  BOOM. Came out perfect-- I really liked the grilled mahi mahi tacos b/c I didn't leave feeling like I just ate 2000 calories.   Perfect for lunch.  The manager checked on us, and the waitress was on point.  We came here during the off hours ( TIP)  so we got in and out.    Looking forward to going back when its not busy :) #3",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=80

Bill came to ~16.  The service was good. Gave 20 for food service even though they were busy with football games going on. When you order, The orders go on some sort of handheld device which I thought was kind of unusual but fine.   I didn't really care for the burger. It was a little slimy & oily even on the bun. It wasn't bad I guess. Pretty standard bar burger. Fries were good.  The place is ok. They had a good selection of beer to choose from although  i thought their beer (which was on happy hour) was just ok. Not bad just ok. Overall not a place I'd recommend but solid if you're hungry.

Julianne M.,"CA, CA",154,12,4,1.0,12/4/2017,"This review is solely on a server's service. My husband and I met here on our first date and as tradition, we visit this restaurant every year on the day and time of our first date.  We had made reservations but had to wait 15 additional minutes as they didn't have seating available as it was a slightly busy night. We were seated in the outdoor area where there weren't many others as it was a chilly night, our server is a young male, in his late 20's to early 30's, shaved head with horned rim glasses. You could say that this dude was your typical hipster looking server. He asked us what we would like to drink and I requested a Sierra Mist with mint leaves. About 15 minutes later, we get our drinks and my drink has 2 small leaves which looked more like lettuce pieces. I called our server back and asked if I could get a few more mint leaves and he then goes to tell me that he would need to charge $1 for mint leaves because it's not standard to the drink. Okay? I dropped the issue and asked if I could just get a different drink as I didn't want to get into an argument over mint. We ordered our food and I ordered their prime rib special.  It took both my husband and my food about an additional 45, 50 minutes to get to our table but it's not a big deal. We weren't ""that"" hungry and we were celebrating our anniversary. Now, by the time we did get our meals, our drinks are empty and need a refill and our server took our cups and disappeared. Slightly uncomfortable to eat without our drinks but we weren't going to complain. We flagged down a busser and asked for our drinks and he came out a minutes later with our drinks. About 10 minutes later, our server comes to our table and is like ""I got you your drinks! Oh someone already brought them?!"" Seriously? At this point, I am starting to get bugged out by the server but I don't want to ruin the night. My Prime Rib meal comes with a Pizookie and I had to flag down a few hostesses to grab my server. Finally was able to tell him that we wanted our dessert, he brings out the mini size Pizookie and our bill. We were pretty full so a mini size was fine but my meal comes with a full size Pizookie, not the mini. As we are eating our dessert, I begin to discuss business with my husband about upcoming filming schedules and production editing when our server who has been nearly absent our entire meal butts into our conversation and asks ""Sorry to interrupt but are you in the film industry? I work in the film industry too! I'm a camera man... etc."" Up until this point this guy has been rude, can't get our orders right, slow service and he's been snooping around listening to our conversation? He overstayed his welcome at our table to tell us about the ""experience"" he has, how he only likes working indie smaller crews, and how serving isn't his ""real passion"" and that it's important for us to network? Kid, get out of my face. It was the most uncomfortable dinner we have had in a very long time. He asked if we could exchange information and we politely declined as we are not interested in working with someone that only lights up to be helpful when its beneficial to them. We took a look at our bill and he even charged us for a full size Pizookie when it should have been included in my meal AND our server gave us a mini size one. We asked another server and she fixed the bill right away. I almost left without tipping due to how arrogant the server was and how uncomfortable we felt at the end of our meal. BJ's, if you're reading this, please tell that server to mind his own business!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2
Katelynn M.,"Orange, CA",291,72,208,3.0,11/27/2017,"Good, bad, but mostly inconsistent. I have come to this location about 4 times now and each was very different than the others. I sat at the bar twice and in the dining area twice. Both bar area experiences were great, but when I was put in the dining area, the service was much slower. At one visit, we waited an hour to get our food and 30 minutes for our beer to come out. We were not checked on, and it seems like they forgot about us for a while.  Glad they changed their menu because they now have some great new items that I am excited to try!  I ordered the pork chop off the specials menu and wow! It was delicious! This made me believe that BJs can do more than just make bomb pizza.   The monkey bread pizookie is arguable the best dessert they have. I order this 3 times at this location and twice it tasted like a freshly cooked sticky bun without the icing. The third time I had it, it was dry and almost stale. I used the ice cream to soften it to eat it and I didn't complain because I was too shy to do so. This is one example of why I say they are inconsistent.  The only thing that is consistent is the wait staff. They have some great servers who are kind and pretty funny! One in particular was a gentleman who helped us in the bar section on a Monday night. He was very attentive to our group and he had an awesome cherry blossom arm tattoo. His jokes made our night! Never got his name, but kudos to you sir!

The mozzarella sticks were good, but unfortunately I could not say as much for the chicken sandwich. It wasn't horrible, but it's the same here as with a lot of chain restaurants -- they add so much stuff (ham, on top of bacon, on top of sauce) that you aren't sure what you are eating -- and then when you pick it apart you realize there's so much stuff because none of it has any real flavor.  And then I felt that gross kind of too full, sick, greasy feeling the rest of the night.  That my daughter, who had the veggie burger, felt the same way, and my other daughter who had the sliders only ended up eating one of them -- I'm thinking it's more universal than just me.   The service was okay.  Our waiter, was super nice, but also super busy with a lot of other large tables.  So, I don't blame him on being slow -- I blame management, hire some more servers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2

The service: the servers were helpful in a sense. They got every item we asked, such as an extra plate or spoon. However, they forgot to set the utensils in the first place. But overall the service wasn't too bad The food - let's start off with the clam chowder; the soup was warm ( maybe that's how it is or maybe it was on the pass for too long), which I don't mind, but my sister had a different opinion. The clam had a smell and it wasn't creamy.   The second dish was the prime rib; it was 15 oz (its huuuge). I didn't like the horseradish dip much. In the end my sister had to ask for the a1 sauce.

Ronny T.,"Garden Grove, CA",249,76,61,4.0,11/29/2017,"First off, BJ's is so littt. They have a variety of food from burgers to steak to vegetarian stuff. It's suitable for anyone to come by and enjoy a great meal. Since this location in particular is near the outlets of orange, it is generally crowded. Especially on weekends, expect a wait time before being seated. The time varies, but you're going to have to wait hence ""wait time"".   Inside the restaurant, the ambience is pretty mellow, not too obnoxiously loud and not too quiet. Everyone is just having a good time enjoying their meals. For me, the wait time was around 30 min before we got seated. I ordered the house top sirloin with no vegetables cause all you need is carbs and protein right? Just kidding I'm not a big fan of greens that's why. What was surprising to me was that on the menu it stated that it's only 500 calories. Lowkey when I saw that I thought I was tripping because all that for 500 calories is pretty spectacular. I had doubts but didn't want to think about it so I wouldn't feel guilty and stuff. I asked the waiter if I can get my meat rare cause rare is the way to go for meat. Don't sleep on rare. Fortunately, BJ's do have the rare option so that's clutchhh. Anyways it costs around 18 bucks but it's healthy so I can't complain. Since the restaurant was crowded, it took a while but the food is so great you can smell it before it got to your table . I took a bite out of the sirloin and that meat is straight fire I kid you not. The meat is really pink but like you know it's safe and stuff which makes the food even better ! The meat has a perfect mixture of dryness and fat, which satisfies your craving instantly. Each bite you can just taste how fresh the meat and how well it was made. The meal comes with rice and mashed potatoes which taste amazing as well, especially the mashed potatoes. Rice tastes like rice so hard to describe it . Overall, BJ's is a place that has  delicious food that is fit for everyone. It doesn't matter if you're vegetarian, the one term for people who only eats fish, vegan, bulking, cutting, etc... come through BJ's for some amazing food and a great time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2

It was just the right size and their selection was pretty decent. They even offer bottomless fries with their grilled cheeses which was super cool. Our server was really on it and made sure we got whatever we needed in a timely manner. We ordered a sampler pizookie and it was burnt.

Thao G.,"Anaheim, CA",227,26,10,1.0,10/18/2016,"We don't always believe low reviews of bad service as long as the food is good. But this location's low rating is accurate! We've been here before and it was not always like this. We came in with 4 toddlers and 6 adults. They decided to seat us outside, at a firepit marble table that is super high. Their highchairs didn't even reach half way up that table. We were the only ones outside so we asked to be moved or else, those toddlers would be dropping like flies... The server kept harassing us for orders even though we just sat down. They brought all our drinks out three times. My husband was surrounded with 3 Dr. Peppers going flat. But once we ordered, the food came out super sloooow. &They still didn't clean empty plates so with all the drinks glasses, we had no place for food. We had to move them to another table to make room ourselves. The food was mediocre. My gluten free pizza was completely burned on the outside. The deep dish pizza with extra sauce was super dry. But we definitely did not say anything because sitting there waiting for them to remake our food sounds horrifying. We asked for ranch/blue cheese and our pizza had gone all cold by the time they came.  We used the $10 off $35 coupon and the server said a manager needs to come and verify it, ""real soon.""  So ""soon"" that she had to tell us that, TWICE!  Our toddlers at this point were kind of turning into pumpkins. &The manager never came. So thank God, the server just applied the coupon and got us our check. Then we sat for a while again waiting for the card to be returned to us.  Longest dinner ever.

Jessica D.,"Irvine, CA",172,217,150,3.0,4/16/2017,I came here with my cousin after seeing a movie on a Friday night at The Outlet. So to be expected the wait is close to 30 min. So after the long wait we were seated in a booth near the front of the restaurant. Our waiter's name was Ralph. He was just ok to me. I definitely think he could've been more friendly. We ended up just sharing the appetizer combo. This was pretty good but nothing to brag home about. My only complaint was when he brought my refills over for my strawberry lemonade he left all the empty glasses on the table. That's a big pet peeve of mine. I never understood why servers do that. Like who wants a bunch of dirty glasses all over their table when they are eating right?  So my over all experience was just ok. I really think this place needs to step up their customer service. I like their food which is why I come back.

Kevin S.,"Anaheim, CA",4,10,17,2.0,11/6/2016,"This review is only for the food I ordered.  The service we received on 11/04/16 from Whitney R. was fantastic... 5 stars. Ordedered the House Sirloin with Baked Potato and Cesar Salad, and a Handcrafted Rootbeer. The rootbeer was great. Not too thick and strong. The salad was just as good, actually a bit bigger than I was expecting which was a nice surprise.  For this, I gave an extra star in my rating. The steak and potato... I know BJ's specializes in pizza, but that is no reason to not care about the other menu options.  I ordered the steak Medium, which would typically result in a moist juicy steak.  The steak I received was nothing like that.  It honestly had the appearance of freezer burn.  It was dried out from end to end.  Once cut, which wasn't an easy task, you could actually see a third of it with zero pink, while the remaining was all pink.  Even with the pink, the steak was rough and not pleasing.  I left a little less than half on the plate. The potato was a bit undercooked.  It had its rough spots. I was hoping the included butter would soften it up, but it didn't. The plate this was served on was absolutely too small.  I realize it was a steak and potato, but there was hardly any room to cut my leather, I mean steak.  With each cut, the potato would nearly slide off the plate.

Worst service of the year award goes to BJ's at the Block of Orange (or whatever it's called now)! Unless you're a party of 12, expect long waits that get longer with each interaction with the waitress! My sister suggested we meet up here to discuss her birthday plans and have dinner and also because it was free pizookie Tuesday. I hadn't visited a BJ's in a long while so I was looking forward to trying a pizza again. After we ate here I remembered why I stopped going to BJ's all together; it lost its luster and is pretty much equivalent to dining at Dave and Buster's in the opposite corner of the mall.     We started with avocado egg rolls and they looked fresh out of the frozen foods section and disheveled. I asked our waitress if it came with dipping sauce and she replied, ""Oh yeah it does. The must be out of ramekins back there. Sorry about that."" My sister said, ""We'll take it in a bowl or on a plate or if they want to bring the sauce out here and drizzle it on the egg rolls, that's fine too."" Off our waitress went into the abyss, never to be seen again. We waited for a while then started eating the egg rolls without the sauce but it was inedible without it. Too tangy and not appetizing at all. Finally, alas she returned with a ramekin halfway filled with some brown stuff that was the sauce.      We ordered a medium sweet pig pizza and a wedge salad. We waited and waited....waited, FINALLY! The  waitress brought the pizza over, placed it on the designated pizza holder and asked if we needed anything else. We said we were good and she looked away and walked off. In the past, I remembered the pizza was piping hot and the waitress would always use the pizza spatula and place a slice of pizza on a plate and give everyone at the table their first slice. Not anymore. So the pizza isn't much of a deep dish anymore. The dough/crust used to taste fried with a nice crispy cheese layer around it. Now it's a baked crust but the pizza itself is pretty flat. Looks like it came out of the freezer and into the oven. The wedge salad wasn't appetizing either.    Fifteen minutes go by and we put our order in for a 1/2 chocolate chip, 1/2 salted caramel pizookie. Fifteen minutes later our pizzokie comes out but it's not even good! Everything here lost its luster. The check took eons to get to us and then she disappeared even longer! Where did she go? It wasn't too busy? I must have had that look of ""Kill me now"" written on my face because another waitress or manager noticed it and came over to take care of the check. She came back and said, ""Ok,  your waitress is taking care of that bill..."" and then my sister lost it and yelled, ""PLEASE TELL HER TO HURRY! I'VE BEEN WAITING HERE FOREVER AND I'M SERIOUSLY GOING TO LOSE IT!"" Then she magically appeared and thanked us but we were irritated and ready to go by that time. No tip was left for the ridiculous service and awful food and the final bill was $52 for avocado egg rolls, wedge salad, medium sweet pig pizza, 2 waters and a free pizookie.  BJ's used to be the happening spot with the good food and beer but I can't trust it after going to the Block location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=160

Chauncey M.,"Long Beach, CA",196,7,,1.0,6/25/2016,"pretty much made up my mind, I'm never going to BJ's to see a game ever again! After Seeing email promo ad and calling this one to make sure THAT GAME was showing (w/sound) , I went this location to see the USMNT-Copa America game. They ended up just having the NBA final game of course, though they put on the US game on the side television - the main TV as well as the sound were just for the NBA finals. Now of course, I GET IT-I GET IT;The finals will always get priority.....BUT, If you guys hadn't advertised it, and if they had specifically told me over the phone otherwise, I would not of had a problem with it-I WOULD NOT HAVE CAME!!! The manager I talk to seem pretty indifferent about it; and just simply maintained there was nothing he could do - after I explained the whole entire scenario to him. He simply said once the sound of the NBA game was on, he was basically powerless to change it. From what me and my friends could see, nobody there was really paying any kind of attention to the games. There were also a handful of other people there with USA soccer jerseys on, so in my opinion making the change of channels would've been completely harmless. So honestly, I found his explanation completely bogus. And naturally, we checked out and left elsewhere. Although he didn't charge us for the wings we ordered, we still paid for the couple beers we had.

Our friend ordered a medium steak, it came out raw.

The waitress said that she would have someone come clean it yet we watched her walk by us 3 times and still no one came to clean it.  We asked another waitress to get someone to clean it.

Andre G.,"Orange, CA",77,81,60,3.0,8/30/2016,"I was looking at all of the ratings for BJ's here and was thinking, why does it have so few stars? I come here fairly often and always have a good time. However, after my last visit, I saw why. Everything was great, except waiting for the check. As I said before, we visit often, so we know the menu well, and knew what we wanted and ordered right away. No trouble there, we even were offered happy hour prices even though we got there about 15 minutes after happy hour. Nice! The food was cooked perfectly, drinks tasted great, and the overall ambiance was enjoyable. But the waiting for the check part was really a bummer. We asked for our check right when our original waiter was going on break, so we had to wait extra long for the new waitress to process all of the tables and get things going. Now I'm okay with waiting a bit and getting an explanation from the waitress, but as I said, we ordered at around 7:15, finished our food at around 8, and left the restaurant at 8:30. 30 minutes to process and close out a check is way too long for me, I'm sorry. It was almost the length of time we spent eating there! And no apology or even a canned response as to why we waited a long time. My girlfriend had to go up to the waitress when she was at the cash register to give her our cards because we grew tired of waiting.  So overall, I love BJ's Restaurants.

Kenny G.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",299,1009,961,3.0,6/21/2016,"Prominent for their ""pizookie"", this particular location, resting on ""The City Drive"" amid ""The Outlets"" (formerly ""The Block"") ....within good ole' ""Orange"", CA, bestows yet another arguably meager franchise of this otherwise woebegone - chain restaurant and brewhouse. With their self-proclaimed slogan alleging conveyances to comprise of, ""An innovative, Southern California twist ....."", the verdict is in and my somber conjecture is that NONE of the employees within this particular establishment were presented that memo. I'm electing to cavort right beyond the menu options for this particular review. Let's face facts, we've all been to BJ's at one point or the next. With their ""Buy 1/Get 1 Free"" entree' concession, as well as noteworthy ""H/H"" specials and somewhat impressive weekend brunch options, one would THINK that they'd covered all bases. Having patronized just over a week ago, I'm led to THINK TWICE on all of the above as I question what the value is in one's bestowing any such option(s), when upon visiting and/or being seated, there's NO ONE AVAILABLE TO offer assistance in one's doing so??? * * * Nothing says customer service like the server (or lack thereof) not knowing which table belongs to them and the bear equivalent of this would likely be said server taking his/her lunch mid-meal leaving one to doodle and thumb twiddle all the while attempting to remit payment. - Sure, they offer handcrafted IPA's on tap. - Sure, they offer an admirable variance of cuisine. - ....and sure, they air all of the games by way of their Best Buy ""LG"" mounted flat screens. Trust me yall'...... When your epiglottis becomes parched from an inevitable prolonged wait for a simple beverage refill --AFTER-- you've endured exhausting the duration of your child's secondary education for an unchallenging salad or flight of wings.................... --ONLY-- to commence in doing the very same as you attempt to request your check just to exit stage right in time enough to make ""Orange Is The New Black"".................

Maricela A.,"Seal Beach, CA",53,20,5,2.0,8/22/2017,"So normally I like BJs but at this location sucked today. We arrived there around 9ish, and the hostess asked us if we wanted to be seated inside, outside or either, we chose inside.. she also explained to us that there would be a 30 min wait, ok no big deal. It was actually less than 30 so not bad, we were taken to our table-which was OUTSIDE... I guess there was no communication on that part. We asked politely to be seated inside they did accommodate and I appreciated it. Now we've been looking at the menu while we were waiting so we know what we wanted and ordered right away. Our waiter, Brennen was great he was on point about everything, one of those two stars belong to him. Now I ordered my favorite dish Cherry Glazed Chipotle Salmon and my husband ordered the Sirloin Steak. The steak my husband had was amazing!! The second star goes to the steak. My salmon on the other hand was Horrible. When I received my salmon everything appeared to be amazing until I lifted the bottom of it and it was super charred, burnt. I took a bite into it anyway just to see if maybe it didn't taste what it looked, yea I was wrong I had to stop eating it. I wasn't going to say anything and chalk up on the bad dinner but my husband asked Brennen to see if I could get a new salmon. Brennen was kind of enough to have the cook fire up a new one. Yea that one sucked too and came out burnt. I just picked around it, ate what I could and gave up on dinner.

For desert, we had the pizookie trio.  Monkey bread, white chocolate macadamia nut, and chocolate chip.  The dessert was the highlight of our meal. We had to wait about an hour to get a booth table... this was at about 7pm on a Saturday night.  Service was not bad.  Our server came by and asked us if we needed anything multiple times. I'd give this a 2.5+ star experience.  The wait was long.. so if we had to do it over again, we'd probably do takeout instead (although.. not sure how the pizookie would taste as a takeout order).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=100

I loved the artichokes and bell peppers on it and the pesto amount was perfect! It's a huge portion (for me anyway) so I took half home (as usual) but it would be great to share this as an appetizer with a few others or a meal with one other person.  Thursday night is pretty packed and busy, but our waitress/server was always checking in with us and always there when we needed  her.

The server let me know the bartender admitted they were short one ingredient.  The drink was removed from the bill. They should not have served the drink when they knew it was wrong.

But this time, at this particular restaurant, we ordered the Sweet Pig and the normal cheese, and what we got was quite different from what we're used to. Sweet Pig: everything looked right, but the crust was soggy, spongy, and oily.  I think the pizza 1). didn't cook long enough, or 2). cooked too slowly, soaking up too much oil.  Texture: like eating a sponge. Taste: canola oil The rest of the pizza was quite salty.  I didn't see much sauce, nor taste the sweetness of the pineapple.  Regular cheese pizza: same as above.  The overriding flavor was salt mixed with canola (or some other vegetable oil).   The good thing is, their management was very helpful, and their servers (we had two, for some reason) were spot on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=100

I guess we returned hoping that the service had gotten better and we were wrong. Our order took an hour to come out, the order was incorrect, and our server forgot to enter one of the entrees.

Lisa H.,"Westminster, CA",57,43,250,1.0,3/16/2017,"We come to the Orange location & HB often but have yet to experience such horrible service. As usual, we place our name on the preferred list before come in. As we got there, we got seated a few minute later, which is normal. We like oh yeah, we got here before 7pm it still happy hours but we couldn't order anything off the happy hours menu (drink -appetizer - etc) because our server was no where to be seen! It took them 10 min for another server to come to our table to let us know that our server was back up & will be over shortly & ask to take our drink order. Which is very nice of him to help our server out. It is understandable since I have work in the food industry so I know sometime it get busy. But really, you could come by & say, I will be over shortly. So, after 15 min of being seated, our server finally came over (my gosh, we are only a party of 2). She came over & took our alcohol drink & food order. We both order the daily special (& last night was the burger special for $10 each). Our alcohol drink came (they had craft beer special for the night at $4 - but was upset with the whole experience that we got charge $6.25 for it instead - I know it not much but when it is advertised at $4 for craft beer) After she took our order, I forgot to tell her that I want my burger to be well done. Took us another 6 min to flag her down. Finally, we told her that my burger need to be well done. She say she will go tell the cooks right away. I was so relief that we finally got to flag her down. Finally, our food came out. As usual, whenever I order my burger, I always cut it in half - to check to make sure there no pink. & what the odd??? Pink!!! So, it took us another few minute to flag our server down as usual. She told us that she told the cook -well done. (or so we hope she did) Manager came over & even say oh my it not even close to mediumSo the manager apologize. On top of that, my boyfriend didn't want to eat his food because by time my food come back he be done. So he waited of course his burger is getting cold here. To top all of this, we did not have any utensil or so, no fork or napkins... So here we go again, flagging our server down & guess what? You got it, our server was no where to be found. So my fries came out in the meantime... Yes!!! My food came - the manager drop off my burger & she left. 2nd time around & it was cook perfect. I got to say, the first burger was more presentable than the 2nd burger (the 2nd burger, my hickory brisket was all on the cookie sheet instead of on my burger - no fork - mean I couldn't pick up my brisket ) Finally after another 5 minute we flag her down for some fork and napkins. My gosh did we had an adventure tonight. How could a server be that inexperience or horrible. I mean you mine as well advertised that you serve raw burger then? It was beyond medium. Wow! Top off my burger, my boyfriend burger he could only ate ¾ of his burger. ¼ of his burger was raw - uncook! Wow! Best part, we were both done. Finally!!! But - guess what??? Our server was no where to be found!!! What the odd again??? I tried to pay using the apps with my credit card since we was so furious for all the long wait. But after trying to pay using the app twice it was declined. It not like my card is bad - it just wouldn't allow me to pay. So after many unsuccessful trying to flag our server down - we hate to do this - but we end up asking another server to flag her down for us - We ask another server to send her over to our table. So after about 10 minute of waiting for our check - our server finally came over & ask what we needed - my gosh? Really? Our napkin is on top of our food - can you not see that we are done and want our check so we could be on our way? I wanna cried! We was so frustrated that we did not even bother asking her to fix the craft beer from $6.25 to $4 as advertised. So we just paid cash and tip her $2. She is lucky she got some tip. But honestly, of all the time we went... Not once did our server came by & ask if we wanted to order another drink or get our water refill. Not once did she came back & ask if our food was good or when my 2nd burger came out if it was better. Not once she came over to ask if we wanted refills on our fries. Not once did she just come by without us flagging her down for question/ help!!! Never have we experience such horrible service, long delay, terrible food, took forever to get our check (someone please update the apps version so we could pay via apps). Got off work early - been waiting all week to come in on a Wednesday to enjoy the $10 burger deal with unlimited fries & $4 craft beer. Was in such happy mood - & our night ended up so horrible & disappointed!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=260

We waited about 30 minutes before being seated. Our waiter came to our table promptly after being seated.  We ordered appetizers and about 15 minutes later we ordered our dinner. While I completely understand it's a busy time, the restaurant definitely felt a bit short handed.  The table didn't seem clean. Our silverware and napkins didn't come until 10 minutes after our appetizers were put on the table. Our silverware was actually dirty- which is pretty gross to me! EWW!! And of course right when we are about to begin eating the appetizers, our dinner arrives.  Before we could even finish our dinner, we were asked about dessert. We weren't exactly sure what to say since we were still in the middle of dinner. As our dinner plates were being cleared the check arrived. We actually wanted to get dessert but considering how rushed the entire experience felt - it was worth leaving and going somewhere else for dessert and drinks.

Only because we were talking all at once, BUT he got it all down. Anything we needed and asked for- he was there with it. Checked on us a few times after the food was served to make sure we were okay if anything else was needed.  After a few bites that my sister took into her jalapeno burger she noticed her meat was red after ordering well done (curr. pregnant), so we obviously wanted to make sure Christopher was aware of it. Again, we only wanted to make sure he was aware of it.

Then I saw the small print on the sign that curbside ends at 9pm so I went in. Food was ready. Cashier was nice enough. Offered me utensils which is good since I'm eating out of my hotel room.  I got to my hotel room, changed into my pajamas, put the perfect show on tv and sprawled my feast onto the bed for me to devour. I was obviously alone. I had ordered steak, asparagus and wedge salad. The salad dressing cup was covered in dressing before I even opened it. No biggie.  Steak time! I ordered it medium. It was burnt, hard as a rock and dry on the inside. The meat was white like an old pork chop. I love char but I wanted it to be at least somewhat juicy! Now I'm trying to cut it with my plastic knife and fork and it was really hard. Like so difficult that I ended up just sticking a fork in it and eating it like a savage. Steak on a stick. I like beef jerky so that worked.  Pretty bummed. I didn't want to take it back because my bra was already off.  My experiences here so far had been excellent. I prefer BJs when I'm craving steak because it's usually done right and priced good and they have asparagus (but bring back the green beans!). Maybe I need to order rare from now on. I'll still go back because I'm sure it was a fluke.

She's easy going, knows her stuff, and is fun to talk to. The food and drinks she suggested were spot on as well. First, I decided on the Harvest Hef, which offered subtle notes of banana and clove, tasty! We started with the lettuce wraps and loved the wasabi mustard sauce. We then split two lunch specials -- the spaghetti and meatballs and the salmon with roasted veggies and quinoa. Both were outstanding, the portions were generous, and we especially loved the spice level of the meatballs. It was then time for an after lunch cocktail. Feeling conflicted.. Alisha was again to my rescue! Being in one of those fickle ""sweet"" but ""not so sweet"" moods, she suggested The Pink Cadillac, which was a match in martini heaven for me. Being in the industry myself, it's usually pretty difficult to leave me impressed as I'm always thinking of what I would have done better.

When I called at 8:30, I spoke with Jennifer who almost immediately placed me on hold for 4 minutes. Then her manager on duty picked up so I explained I was calling to check the status of an order and he put me right back on hold for another 3 minutes. After that, Jennifer picked up again and said sorry but you have to call GrubHub. I asked her if she was sure it wasn't DoorDash... Yup, you guessed it - she put me on hold again for another 4 minutes to ask someone who I should contact. I understand completely that it's not BJ's fault whether or not a dasher comes to pick up an order, but I am very disappointed in the way they chose to handle the situation. Huge lack of customer service from both the associate and manager on duty. I wasn't looking for a refund or a comped dessert - I just didn't want to wait almost 15 minutes for someone to finally tell me that it wasn't their problem.

Amanda M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",243,164,191,5.0,1/5/2017,"I hadn't been to a BJ's Restaurant in a long time before this last BJ's visit. So, while I had some idea of what to expect, I was still very impressed with the food and the service here - Above and beyond what I might have expected from a well-known restaurant chain. We had a large and loud party of 10. I was expecting to wait 45 minutes on this busy Thursday night at 7pm, but my party was called within 15 minutes. Since not everyone had arrived yet, I told them to go ahead and put me back down for another 15 minute wait. This, I was sure would result in us losing out table and waiting a very long time. Instead, 15 minutes later when my party arrived, we were seated right away. When more people than expected arrived, they were more than happy to bring over another table and two extra chairs. The waiter was patient enough and very friendly with my boisterous family members - of which both genders were flirting with him and paying him sincere compliments. We all left feeling full and well-taken care of. I would recommend this restaurant and hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised with the high level of service and good tasting food when you visit too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=180

Diane P.,"Culver City, CA",0,17,,1.0,7/4/2017,"If there was an option to give zero stars, I definitely would. My fiancé and I went here this evening to have dinner before going to Disneyland. We were seated very quickly and our server did not speak to us or look at us for FIFTEEN minutes. My fiancé and I sat there wondering if we should just get up and leave or get up and find the manager. The waitress finally came over to us and didn't apologize for the wait and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered our drinks, apps, and entrees all at once, fearing she would never return! We tried to order ribs and they were all out- so weird! She asked us if we wanted our apps to come out before our entrees and we agreed. Literally two minutes later, she brings out my fiancé's Irish mule and my house salad, which had the tiniest amount of dressing. We sat there waiting for my drink to arrive and my fiancé's Caesar salad. A few minutes later I received my drink but still no sign of the salad! Our appetizers arrived and the artichoke was good but our flatbread was soggy and undercooked! Still no sign of the Caesar salad! The waitress walks over and asks if everything is alright and I told her the salad had not arrived and she admitted she never put the order in!! My drink was empty and she did not offer to get me a refill, I had to ask her to please get me more iced tea! She did not ask my fiancé if he wanted another cocktail, which could have increased the check total and her overall tip. Our entrees arrived right after that and my pizza was doughy and messy. The waitress came back over and asked if we got the salad yet, and since we did not we just cancelled it because our meal was already at the table. The food was alright, definitely not the best we have at at BJ's. As we expected, our waitress took forever to get our check and to run our card. I definitely would not return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=300
Leasha C.,"Olympia, WA",261,584,688,5.0,12/4/2013,"I am so happy they put a BJs at the Block now. The location is nice, parking is a bit annoying but when isn't parking at the Block annoying? Walking in, the place is very clean, the staff are nice and greet you right away. We decided to take my brother-in-law out to dinner for his bday on Sunday the 1st. Parking was crazy but walking in, it wasn't that busy. My fiance and I ordered the 2 for $35. He got the pork chops and tortilla soup while I ordered the salmon and house salad. I have to say, we were both very pleased. He has a big appetite so we tend to stay away from the 2 for $ deals because he never gets enough to eat. These were full portions. The salmon was amazing, I typically don't like ordering fish out because most places over cook it and dry it out. Not BJs, it was perfect. Exactly how I would have cooked it at home. Moist, nicely seasoned and everything. My fiance had no complaints about the pork chops. My Brother-in-law and mother-in-law both ordered a burger with blue cheese (yuck) they were both very happy with no complaints. All-in-all, I'm very happy with this location and think they've finally brought something new to the Block, it was much needed. There is only so many times you can go to D&B and Fridays before you're tired of both. Happy to see something new. :D  **Update** our server was Johnathan. he was amazing, always on top of things and fixed anything that went wrong. Its a new location so the kitchen is still trying to work out the kinks and communicate with the wait staff. Nothing to deduct stars over though. They see the mistakes, they acknowledge them, and they're fixed immediately.  Perfect customer service. I'll pick this location over the others. 2nd visit: Dec. 21 for our 8th anniversary.   We decided to sit out on the patio. Oh man, if this was our first visit, it would have for sure been our last. Eulises was our server. We both ordered tea. I ordered the fruit flavored tea and me fiance got black unsweetened. The entire meal my fiance was lucky to get 1 refill. Not to mention, we had to basically bombard them to get them to stop so we could get a refill.  A girl we stopped to get a to-go container from did more in the 3 seconds she worked with us than he did along with the person that released him for his lunch did the entire hour or so we were there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=300

And brings me a menu, until I point it out she offer to bring me some extra sauce on the side. But the worst part is everyone is like on a rush or something that they don't even stop for a second to talk to there guess. So the food runner drop off the food and ran off before I could even ask him for silverware, so I waited 5 minutes before a waiter drops by to give me silverware to eat my food.

The first time I went was for dinner and I received excellent service. My server was very attentive and checked up on us constantly. I wasn't sure about which salmon dish to order, but my server was very detailed in explaining about each dish so I ended up getting the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon because it was on the sweeter and saucier side rather than the buttery baked Atlantic Salmon. It was about $15 and I was very happy with my choice! The second time I went was for lunch with a large group of nine people and our server was excellent also. I ordered the classic bacon burger for about $11. For dessert, of course you have to order a pizookie! They have about 8? 9? flavors of the pizookie. My favorite is the cookies n cream one! The regular single pizookie is about $7. It comes with the baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top and whip cream.  I took off a star in my review for this place because one of my friends found a piece of hair in his pasta. It was taken back and redone but it took forever! We were all done with our meals before it came back again.

Reneesha R.,"Anaheim, CA",70,65,14,2.0,7/20/2014,"I've eaten at a number of BJ's locations, and this is by far the worst. What a shame.  I came here right after I got off of work from a store in the mall I just wanted a nice cool drink and a pizza to wind down from a long day at work. It was about an hour from closing, so I did not expect any problems. I made a note to the hostess that my boyfriend was on his way and was using crutches, so she seated me accordingly. So I sat alone for awhile hoping the server would come around and get me a drink while I waited. However, she didn't show up until 15 minutes later when my boyfriend had already arrived.  So I ordered the berry burst cider and a Jeremiah red for my other half. Then we ordered the BJ's classic pizza in a shareable size (14 inches). The drinks came first. It kind of took awhile for them to arrive, but when they did, they were ice cold and delicious. Then we waited for the pizza. That also took awhile. When it arrived, my boyfriend and I looked at each other and gave a look of 'this isn't quite right'. The pizza looked small and was quite misshapen. It was also cut horribly.  We called the server over to make sure we actually got the shareable pizza rather than the individual (which is 11 inches). She assured us that it was the correct size and even counted the slices (the shareable is supposed to have 10 slices while the individual has 6 slices, but come on, you can cut 10 slices in a smaller pizza and call that the bigger one, which is what I believe they did). Kind of bs considering that the shareable is $20 while the individual is $13, so we completely got ripped off.  So we ate the whole thing fairly quickly, which is much different than all the other times we've ordered pizza from BJ's. Usually we have some leftover to take home even when we are super hungry, but not this time. Then, for some reason unknown to me now, we ordered dessert. I wanted the new peanut butter smores pizookie, but my boyfriend didn't want to get it here because they ""might f**k that up too."" So we got the new peach cobbler instead. That ALSO took way longer to come out than expected, which by this time was just getting ridiculous because there was barely any people in the restaurant when I got there and I know the kitchen wasn't shutting down yet, so there was honestly no excuse for food to be coming out so slowly.  While I do have a complaint about the cobbler, I don't believe it's the fault of this particular BJ's. All the components eaten together made it taste like a mouthful of ginger. Perhaps that's my palette, but it just tasted off to me.  I'm seriously not a picky person, especially when it comes to food and I tend to give services the benefit of the doubt, but I hold BJ's to a certain standard having eaten there so many times. If you're going to charge $7 extra for 3 more inches on the pizza, it damn well better be the right size and not look like the chef just smacked it down on a plate and haphazardly sliced it. And please train the staff! It seems like they were all new hires with no experience in serving or cooking. While the decor was just lovely, everything else felt flat.  I think we'll just stick to the Cerritos location where the manager, Ulf, is a sweetheart who cares about the guests and the servers give you an enjoyable experience.

Unfortunately they decided to have only 1 screen on college football (the others were NFL network and MLB network). When requested to change it up, the bartender said she had to ask the manager. He didn't do anything and eventually the bartender tried to do it herself. After 1 hour still only had 2 games on.  They have a large video board over the bar which shows 1 game on a good size and three tiny games below it. Those sub screens are a waste and can't be seen from anywhere.  The food was average (no better or worse than any other BJs) and the beer is always nice and cold.

Katie R.,"Whittier, CA",51,67,3,1.0,6/11/2015,"I love the BJs I usually go to in Lake Forest, and I suggested to come to this location for everyone's geographic convenience with a group of seven for what was supposed to be a fun night out. Instead, we all ended up leaving angry due to the sorry service we received.  It was on a Monday night and it wasn't exceptionally busy, yet it took 45 minutes to get a table. When we finally were seated there were six of us squished into a booth designed for 4, and a member of our party arrived shortly after us had to find a chair and pull it up herself to fit.  The waitress took forever to get our drink orders, and by that time happy hour was long gone. She was super rude when we asked about getting happy hour prices after waiting for her for so long, and in the end we only got one round at happy hour price. She had an annoyed, pissed off expression the entire time she was serving us. It's obvious that she hates her job. Soup and salads started to be brought to our table, and I thought ""oh, did you guys order appetizer salads?"", and they said ""no, this is all we ordered"". I thought it was really dumb that they would bring out the food at different times. Half our party had already finished eating by the time everyone else's food was brought out.  Our dirty dishes sat at our table the entire meal, our water glasses were never refilled, our waitress was impossible to track down. When finally someone made eye contact, we told her we wanted to order pizookie. The pizookie was brought out 20 minutes later. By this point I had enough, and sent it back because we were just anxious to get out of there.  Someone called over the manager, who was useless. He just stood there befuddled by the whole situation like he didn't even know how to do his job. When someone has a bad dining experience, you should be doing everything you possibly can to make it right. The manager finally cleared our table of dishes after we pointed it out to him, and we never saw our waitress the rest of the night. Our checks took an additional 15 minutes to get to us, and there was no discount, no offer to come back, no free appetizer, nothing. It was really disappointing, and a complete wet blanket on our night out. I can't remember the last time I received such crummy service at an industry that should be based on customer service. I'm paying for the experience, I wouldn't normally go and spend $20 on pizza. Take some notes from the Lake Forest",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=300

Unfortunately, this one was the same story. Strike #1: a hostess told us it was happy hour and instructed us to sit in the bar area. When we asked the waiter whether it was happy hour, that notion was struck down immediately... hm ok. This was really minor compared to Strike 2 and 3. Strike #2: the food was underwhelming. The fish (for the fish and chips dinner) was very oily- there was nothing light about the batter as described. At points, it was just easier to peel away the batter and eat the fish inside. I wish this dish came with coleslaw or something pickled because after a couple of bites, it would be difficult for anyone to take in all that oil/grease. My friend got their spicy spaghetti which I took a few bites of- holy moly, there wasn't anything remotely spicy to it. In fact, you could call it a bland spaghetti. Fortunately, generous portions of parm and red chili flakes somewhat saved the dish, but by then, it felt like we prepared the meal with how much we had to add to the dish. Sorry for all of you Chef Boyardee fans out there, but I'd rather have a can of that at home than order this again. Strike #3: service was painstakingly slow (around 9pm on a Wednesday). It was difficult to flag our waiter, it seemed like he was trying to avoid our table or something. When we asked another server to get us ketchup, she straight up dogged us and made it very apparent we were inconveniencing her... and here we were asking someone else in the hopes that our request would come out a bit quicker. Alas, when we were trying to retreat from the restaurant, it took a total of 30 minutes (yes, by this point we felt so inclined to time it) from the time the check came out to our table until we were able to get our bill paid.  So really, I have been so let down by you BJ's. When you were at your prime, I really enjoyed it but lately, it just has been a huge disappointment. The last time I wrote a review and was contacted by someone willing to make it right, I actually responded but never heard back- their customer service in general is just beyond me. I have zero intentions on bringing my business back here and hope you steer clear too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=280

Will also include my experience with take out. + Bar service was great + Food tasted great + Their beer selection is nice I came here on a weekend to just chill and hangout, mainly get some beer. I had the Thunderstorm IPA? I forgot which, but it was recommended by the bartender and it didn't disappoint. Prices were about as avg as any other spots around the area. I believe $5~ for a cup of beer? I forgot. Either way, food didn't take long, and bartender was attentive. I also had ordered take-out during their free pazookie promo. It went well, I ordered online and mentioned that I'd be picking up in 30 minutes. I arrived, and sure enough, my food was ready just on time. No hiccups or issues, just an easy in and out transaction.  Overall, I'd come here again and again.

Steve B.,"Torrance, CA",18,256,26,2.0,1/25/2016,"As everyone said; they are busy even at 9-11pm at night and that seems to affect the service and wait times immensely. Maybe it trickles down to the employees being stressed with the workload which causes the long wait times and drinks not being refilled as I noticed 1 waiter covered a decent size area. Even saw smashed food under the table entire fries; again assuming a hiring issue causes this; forcing less staff to do more work; something has to give. Our server was nice enough but definitely running constantly with orders. That being said, the food was OK, had the hickory brisket and bacon burger; which was decent and the plate seemed to lack more fries..who doesn't expect more fries? The pene pasta didn't seem overwhelming in size either; for portion pricing of 12-16 for plates, you might expect more. But again the place was full; so either not many places open at that time of night that have a bar to congregate and eat food as well or people have accepted what it is.

You got them usual drinks glowin' and they're all neatly organized against the wall! Photo frames also litter the walls, but not too overwhelming that it causes an eyesore (like other restaurants cough cough). The floors looked clean and everyone around seemed to be having a good time chatting away with their groups!  The server arrived soon after we got seated. I believe her name was Miranda. She was sweet and young, but that didn't tamper with her professional customer service skills!!  Our food arrived in a timely manner. My friend ordered the sriracha mac and cheese - it was good, not spicy in our opinion but still tasty! Recommended if you're a mac n cheese and Sriracha fan! The other had a chicken thyme rice dish, the chicken tasted really good! Seasoned with the right amount of zest! And I ordered a chicken club sandwich! The chicken in the sandwich is a good size too, they ain't shy with the slab of chicken, woo!  Miranda brought over a new server since she was leaving (sorry I don't remember the name but he was nice). He constantly checked up on us and refilled our waters cups.  To finish, we ordered a chocolate chip pizookie! It took a while to come out though.  They kindly split the bill according to our order, which was much appreciated!

Esteban B.,"Phoenix, AZ",84,155,240,2.0,8/23/2015,"Awesome selection of beers, too bad our server made recommendations based on her personal taste instead of trying to understand what we liked.  I tried a Jeremiah Red, delicious.  I was talked out of the pirhana pale ale, she described it as ""Hoppy to the point of bitter, with a strong finish""  Yes, it was hoppy, and delicious, I would have had more.  The Jeremiah Red was pretty darn good as well. Why do I talk about the beer instead of the food?  Because the food was not that great.  The food server even worse.  Here's how it plays out.  I ordered a ribeye steak, medrare, with cheddar mashed potatoes and a wedge with Blue Cheese dressing.  What I got was a steak that was medwell at one end, rare at the other and tough all over.  Barely seasoned, there was no salt/pepper on the table, but after chewing on this for a while, I understood why she brought the A-1.  I held out as long as I could, but I finally gave in.   The wedge of lettuce with Blue Cheese dressing never appeared.  That is, until the steak arrived, accompanied with mashed potatoes and potato wedges.  Really??  Does anybody from the server to the chef to the expediter actually read the tickets, then think about the order?  Wouldn't you question the dueling potatoes?  I called this to the servers attention, and she claimed ""well, I ordered the lettuce wedge!  Um, yeah, okay, where is it and why am I being served wedge potatoes? The salad arrived shortly and it was the best part of the meal.  My beer glasses started stacking up on the table as the server came by to check back, then a few minutes later, with a bite of A-1 covered steak halfway to my mouth, she comes back to see if we want dessert.  Timing.  You need it.  After we turned it down, she went away again. Empty beer glasses still on the table. We were still chewing on our dinner when she dropped the check off.  ""No hurry, she says, Take your time""   OMFG, are you really trying to get stiffed? -5 stars for the service.  -3 stars for the food.  +2 stars for the beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=280

My family and I went there and waited about 15 minutes for a table (which was fine). Then they sat us (3 people) and then we waited another 15 minutes before any type of service began.  My husband left the table and approached the hostess letting her know that no one has helped us yet and she said she'd take care of it. As he was walking up, one of the servers finally said that they'd be right with us. She walked by again a minute later saying the same thing, and then started helping the table next to us which just got seated and was still in the process of sitting down...  What was the point of even sitting us?  Very rude!!! We decided to leave which probably went unnoticed as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=220

I went online to do takeout and ordered the lunch specials for the Fettuccine Alfredo and spaghetti. I got to the restaurant, and it was not busy (dine-in and takeout), yet it took ten minutes to pay and retrieve my order. Chelsea was incredibly slow in getting my order and didn't even offer me utensils like the other customer before me.  There was another customer who came in five minutes after me and was helped first. Two managers/shift leads came by and still didn't offer help.  I scratched the hell off the space where you can tip the server because that was just the saddest service I have ever seen.  Fortunately, the pastas were one of the best. The broccoli in the fettuccine was still undercooked, but still edible.  Overall.

We each ordered one pazookie and the attitude that we received from our waitress was unflattering. Whether a table spends $15 or $100 shouldn't justify different service styles; we are all paying customers. She acted as if we weren't worth her time and she wanted to push us out quickly so another tabletop could spend and tip more. Nonetheless, before we even got our Pazookies, she slapped us with our bill not even few minutes after passed since we ordered. In all the restaurants I have been to in my lifetime (including multiple BJ's), I have never gotten this type of service from a server. She didn't even refill our waters at all.

They let us the know the wait time is about 40 minutes. That's not an issue, we figure it's 8:30, let's just kill some time and go to do some shopping. We come back to find that our name has already been called but that's not a problem because we are quickly seated anyways. We are seated and greeted by a guy by the name of Patrick. It was very easy to connect with him, sociable guy and made us have a couple good laughs in between ordering our food. Well things started going south quickly. The wait time to order food and get our food was a little long. When we finally got our food, there wasn't any ketchup or Parmesan cheese. So here we are trying to flag down anyone to get us these things and refills. Patrick is no where to be seen so a guy by the name of James attends to our needs. Throughout the entire dinner we're constantly having to flag down people (anyone other than Patrick) We were very understanding, we get it, it's busy. It took 40+ minutes to order a pizookie. I finally had enough and talked to management to see if we could get an extra pizookie given the time frame and how inattentive our server was. Michelle was very great!!! & agreed without hesitation, bringing out 2 pizookies fairly shortly after. Patrick walks by and makes a remark about me talking to management. Then as we're in the middle of finishing up our dessert, Patrick brings out yet another pizookie!! He mutters something and shoves it on the table. We're left stunned because we didn't ask for a third pizookie and we don't even know what he said. We ended up giving it away to the party right next to us. Jokes on Patrick if he tried anything funny! We pay our tab, and let James know we appreciate him taking the time to attend us when we really weren't his intended party to serve. Right as we're leaving, James happens to be at the door and we again say thank you & goodnight. Well Patrick walks by and screams (literally) ""have a good night!!!!!!!!"" Everyone's face was stunned and of course we're left dumbfounded. I end up calling the restaurant and explained to management what happened. Michelle again took care of me and promised to take care of the issue. She even offered to send me a gift card via email. Michelle and James, you rock! I get it, it's a crazy day but the treatment tonight was something I cannot understand.

So my friend and I charged for a booth in the bar area instead of waiting, and cut off a couple getting there. Faster you move, the more likely you'll get what you want, right? So the server came by very quickly asking if we were ready. Um, slow down buddy, we just sat down. Then it took a bit till he came back. And when my friend finished ordering, I had to stop him quickly cause I had a question. Slow down buddy, what happened to customer service? The bar wasn't even crazy busy. Our drinks came over, got myself a snakebite (if I remember the name correctly, lol), and again it was a quick drop and go and not a check-in. My pizza arrived, and again very quick to serve and not check-in with us. I ordered the Gourmet Five Meat pizza. Love their pizza here. Love the light, airy crust and the quality of the pizza ingredients. The next time we see our server, he drops off the check and takes off! Hold on homie, I wanted dessert and a box for my pizza! Had to wait again till he came by so I can get the box and order my pizookie. Got a regular chocolate chip pizookie and I love how it always comes out nice a warm with that creamy scoop of ice cream. It's always a great way to end a meal. After reading a review on here, she got the same service experience, being very rushed. Service is everything and can make or break our overall experience. So minus 2 stars for being rushed with the lack of service. The 3 stars is strictly for the food.

I had their Veggie Omelette and the main reason I ordered it was because I prefer egg whites. I didn't realize it but when the food came out the portions was super small. I guess that's why the title was enLIGHTened. The light part was in red. I didn't pay attention until my meal came and looked at the menu again. Dang it. LOL. Not bad the Omelette was good but it would have been nice if I have gotten more of it. Oh well lesson learned.

Dana M.,"Pasadena, CA",11,75,40,4.0,9/28/2015,"Ah. The restaurant chain with the pornographic name. Somewhere inside my head I feel a bit pervy when I offer ""BJs"" as a suggestion for a place to chow down. As I'm certain at least half the of the U.S. already knows what it's like to dine at one of their 159 locations, I'll strive to avoid repetition. As someone pretty much over the ""let's try new restaurants just for fun"" phase of my life, BJs and/or Yardhouse are generally the establishments I fall back on. Burgers, pizza, pasta, salads, beer, sandwiches...you know the drill. The chain is pretty consistent in terms of taste, quality (eh...that's 'sports bar' quality, not Jack's Bistro...), and vibe. If you actually want to talk to and hear the people/person you're with, keep in mind BJs has pretty raucous noise levels. Then again, if you're on a blind date with a real tampon, the decibel level could work in your favor.  This is the first time I've been to the Orange location...came here on Thursday after playing hooky from work to spend the afternoon at Sunset Beach. Located at the Block in Orange (now the City...I think), the parking may be a bit hairy depending when you go. Shopping center madness. But after the mass of calories you will most likely consume, it may not be such a bad thing to hoof it an extra half mile back to the car after dinner. Listed are some notable points from my most recent visit:  FOOD/BEER: -Avocado Egg Rolls - Deee-to-the-lish. -Pizza - I wanted to like it but it was only a meh. Couldn't decide so I got 1/2 Pepperoni Extreme and 1/2 Chicken Bacon Ranch. When I questioned our server about the CBR, he built up the taste sooooo much I felt mighty disappointed when it I discovered it to be practically void of taste. AVOID this one. Greasy and bready. Carbocide. Zzzzzzz. :( -If you're into IPAs - Go for Jeremiah Red. If you like something lighter - Go for the Lightswitch Lager. I generally fluctuate between the two, depending on my mood. :) -Check out the beer blends - 1/2 beer and 1/2 cider - saw this after I ordered my beer. Note to self: try next time. TIPS:  -BJs almost always has a guaranteed 20-30 min wait time. Don't feel like waiting? Try this: put your name down w/ the hostess, then scope out the first come, first serve bar area - they offer the same menu.

(yes it will always be the Block to me) I am not the biggest fan of there pizza based on trying other BJ's restaurants but there other dishes are happy hour deals are pretty great here.  This place is a very clean and nice establishment that offers a wide variety of great brews on tap. Now they don't brew on site which is kind of a bummer but still BJ's beer has gotten a lot better over the years. My wife and I love coming in during football where they do happy hour all day. They have pretty good wings although ask for extra crispy. The Corn Fritters are pretty good and you can grab them for cheap during happy hour. Also my wife is a fan of the Avocado Egg Rolls, these are always great.  The brews here that are made in house varies from season. I recommend the Hop Storm IPA if they have it. Piranha Pale is also pretty tasty but not as hoppy as a IPA. If your a dark beer fan check out the BJs Porter. Oh and to the reviewer that had bad service I have been in here a few times and always sit in the bar area I have had amazing service every time.

Our waitress, Toni, was great at the beginning. She went on break and then left Maria to wait on us. I'm sure Maria is a hard worker, but she is a hard worker who neglected our table. Our table was full of empty dishes, the pizza we ordered to go looked like someone shoved it in the box. We have enjoyed BJ's for almost 30 years and never saw a pizza boxed the way saw this pizza boxes. When we questioned Toni (who was now back from her break), she paused and didn't offer to just get another pizza made. We had to ask for one. In almost 30 years of eating BJ's in various states, we have always been offered whatever it was that needed correcting by the BJ's staff.  So I asked Mike, the manager, and he clarified that we should not have been asked and handled the situation in a very professional and respectful manner.  I am going to have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the service. But when the manager is called upon, he shows up with the professionalism that we usually get when something happens at a BJ's location.   The service? Not so good.

The really good news is, although I was in California when I first tried this restaurant, I am happy to discover they have locations in quite a few states so look them up.  I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken that's served with mashed potatoes & broccoli. The chicken was so moist, so delish. The mashed potatoes were a little dry, but not too dry that they weren't palatable. I didn't touch my broccoli ;don't judge me) My colleague ordered the Mahi Mahi and cleaned her plate. She said it was the best she's ever had. The only disappointment of the visit was that the appetizer came out after the entree and was overlooked and slightly burnt upon arrival.

We sat for about ten minutes before our server even acknowledged us and it wasn't even busy for a Wednesday evening. My girlfriend almost wanted to walk out soon after. We ordered the deep dish lasagna with the side salad, and the Mediterranean pita chicken. The salad came out without any utensils so we had to wait again before we could flag down another server because they keep disappearing somewhere. Apparently, our initial server just ended his shift. So he just rushed when he took out orders, never bothered to transfer us to our new server and pretty much left us hanging.  Overall, food and drinks were great.The server that took over was outstanding. The other server needs to be retrained. Only three stars because experience was poor due to service.

Adriana V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",1,12,3,2.0,6/13/2016,"First bad experience at BJs! I went on a double date (keep in mind we are all in our early 20's) and literally lost my appetite. The server, Michelle, seemed very friendly at first.... But no. She took a while to get us our drinks and appetizers. Overall, she was just very inattentive with our party. And it was noticeable since she would only keep checking up on the tables right next to us. Long story short, it took more than 40 min to get our burgers... 40 min! At first we were very patient. I get it, it's a Saturday night, it's prolly not her fault. I called a manager over and told him our situation. By then we barely got out food. Michelle asked if we needed anything else, and we said ranch and BBQ sauce please. The guy I called over called the general manager I guess, Ryan. He was very concerned and helpful. They even offered free dessert. Let's forward... 20 min pass and we still haven't gotten our ranch. Now the server is avoiding us. She might have gotten mad for us complaining, but if I'm going to BJs and paying for great food and service, i expect that and nothing less. She finally gets us our ranch and THROWS AND SLAMS THE PLATE FULL OF RANCH AND SAUCE ON THE TABLE. I AM DEFINITELY NOT OKAY WITH FOOD THROWN ON MY TABLE. Still, we thanked her and she didn't even turn to look at  us. That's when i stood up and personally had to find Ryan. I explained the situation. He realized that not only was the food service not good, but our server was incredibly rude and disrespectful. I asked for a change in server and I do appreciate Ryan taking care of the situation and personally bringing us the check. Side note: we didn't get dessert. We all had lost our appetite and decided to leave ASAP! I understand that as younger customers we usually are thought as bad tippers, but honestly that was not the case with us. We didn't complain to just get a ""free dessert"", we just needed to speak up. I didn't make a scene, but I do appreciate the Manager Ryan and how he handled the situation. Will I be back.... Eh.

Jeong P.,"Irvine, CA",275,430,1044,2.0,4/4/2014,"I've never been a fan of BJ's, because it's just a run of the mill chain restaurant and their beers are not very good. But I thought that stopping in for a quick happy hour would be decent. I was wrong. We ordered a few things off the happy hour menu, and it seemed like a pretty good deal. But in reality, the food is crap. What's the point of even having a happy hour menu, if the items are gonna be this half-ass? I suspect they have gotten complaints about this before, because I noticed that they write ""happy-hour size"" above each selection. The portion sizes are pathetic, even for the $4-5 that they charge. Do yourself a favor and just order a regular menu item. At least you won't feel insulted when they bring you the cheapest constructed food known to man, that they call their happy hour food. Also, our server was a douche. Just because you don't actually say anything rude, doesn't mean that you're not being rude. I understand people who don't like their job, but sometimes you just need to suck it up. This place sucks.

Temenah C.,"Anaheim, CA",393,1040,3,1.0,6/22/2014,"I wasn't planning on writing a review for BJ's because I figure you been to one, you been to them all. However, my experience here made me sit down and write a review because the service was something else. We were a party of 6, 4 adults and 2 children, but 2 of us arrived first. I told the hostess that there would be 6 total, 4 adults and 2 children. There were 3 people standing behind the hostess desk and apparently the request to seat 4 adults and 2 children was a lot to handle. They just looked at each other like they had never heard of such a mixed group. There was another party that was behind us so the hostess told us, ""move to the side there are people behind you."" Ummmm ok. So they finally take us to a table and give us 6 regular menus. Again, I said there will be 4 adults and 2 children. Does this type of request not happen much? Our server came by and we asked for waters while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. They must have gone all the way to a sacred spring for this water because it took forever to get to us. We ordered our drinks and when the server brought them over he couldn't tell the difference between 2 of them. At this point, I'm thinking, ""you're kidding me"". We started with appetizers, but were never brought plates to share or napkins or silverware. Apparently this was Medieval Times and we were supposed to use our hands and perhaps, our feet. When we asked for plates and napkins and silverware, they had to scramble to find us stuff. I mean, they literally brought 2 plates and napkin sets at a time. When all of our food finally arrived, they forgot one dish and the server couldn't even remember what it was. Also, my friend's shrimp tacos were a little cold and when the runner brought the food out he didn't know and couldn't identify what we ordered. This happened, ""Uhhhh this is pizza with pesto orrrr something"". It actually wasn't.  So here's the deal. I normally don't have an issue with BJ's. It is what it is. This location though, I'd go to one of the other restaurants in The Block. Oh, the pizzookie was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=420

We sat in a relatively empty area (there were only about 3 or 4 other tables filled around us). The server was polite, but really kept trying to push us out of there. We were only there for the 4th quarter of the game, so for about an hour. We ordered plenty (drinks, appetizers, entrees) but the server kept trying to rush our check. At one point, whenever we looked down from the TV we saw her in the waitress booth just staring at us. If the place was packed, then I would get it, but there were plenty of open tables around us.

Aden J.,"Detroit, MI",31,172,,2.0,12/1/2014,"On the way into this BJs, there was a sign in front of the entrance that read, 'Tailgate Happy Hour: Dining Room, Bar, and Patio, 2 Hours before Game'. My party of four goes in, and we ask to double check if happy hour is available in the dining room. It is 6 pm and the Ducks vs. Bruins game going on down the street begins in an hour. FIVE HOSTESSES tell us that happy hour is only available outside or at the bar. One of my friends, having just seen the sign, asks again if happy hour is available in the dining area. Again, FIVE hostesses tell us that 'HH' is just in the bar or outside. Our party decides not to the press the issue, and sits at the bar. We ask our waiter at the bar if tailgate happy hour is going on in the dining room. He says it is going on the whole restaurant. We decide to just sit at the bar because the server at least understand that tailgate happy hour was going on throughout the restaurant. The male server who helps our table at the bar is very nice and prompt, and so is the female server who takes over for him when he goes on his dinner break. Three times other servers bring food to our table that is for the table next to us. They're nice though even with whatever communication problem is going on. The food and drinks are all fine. This BJ's clearly has some organizational issues if five hostesses are telling customers that tailgate happy hour is not going on in the dining room when a sign says that it is and the servers at the bar (doing their job) are also aware of this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=420

Amanda A.,"Los Alamitos, CA",65,15,13,2.0,6/29/2015,"Stopped in for a quick early dinner with my sister after our mom's surgery. When we first walked thru the door, the hostess told us she would seat us shortly and told us to stand aside. We stood there for awhile, long enough for me to think that we might just go sit in the bar area.  Once we were seated, we sat and waited awhile for a waitress to take our drink orders. She took our orders and before coming back with the drinks, came back with another waitress amd said, "" i'm getting off eight now and coco will be taking over"". For the next hour we continued to see our original waitress servong other tables. Got our drinks amd ordered a small pizza for the 2 of us..seemed to have taken quite awhile to get our food. The pizza was good, a little heavy on the onions but good,  and the guy who brought out the pizza was nice and quick to bring us out cups of ranch. Once we finished our pizza we wanted dessert. The waitress comes by and asked if we would like to pay..we said we want a pazookie. And she says ok what kind. Never offered a menu to help choose and its odd for a server not to ask if you want dessert, especially at a place with a signature dish. We got the cookies and cream and it was quite tasty. Paid the bill in cash at the table and walked out...not even a have a good night or anything from the hostess. In conclusion, it  took over an hour and a half to get a small pizza and a pizookie.

Tim R.,"Corona, CA",33,65,144,2.0,5/15/2016,"I did not have a great experience at BJs restaurant. Firstly I signed up for the club and got the app. Tried to call ahead to Make a reservation and was told they don't do same day, but I could use the online app 30min before I go to st up the reservation. When my date arrived at 1030 pm they didn't have the reservation I made at 10pm. So ball dropped there, but they made good and seated her. Now on top of that we preferred the chicken ranch pizza with the dinner for two special that's being promoted. It comes with 2 soups, a medium pizza, and a pizzuki.  Now the chicken pizza had way too much cilantro and it was clumped weirdly all over. I saw right away that this would make it inedible and my date hates cilantro. I had to ask them to take it back, this they did reluctantly. My date was sure that they would spit in the food and I assured her that this was not the case in such a big and busy kitchen.  Also my date had ordered the creamy broccoli soup and by her face when she tasted it, I could tell that it was disgusting. She had mentioned it was Luke warm. I'm just glad that we didn't get food poisoning.

Michelle V.,"Anaheim, CA",136,38,27,2.0,5/16/2016,"I'm a firm believer in second chances, sometimes even 3rd ones, but oh God, this place has ruined that for me. I've been here 3 times and every time it disappoints. The first time I came was to celebrate my birthday and they took about 45 minutes to seat us (4) and took about another 45 to bring out our main dishes. Second time I came I order some shrimp pasta and the shrimp still had its shell! Third time I came which was a few days ago, I knew I had enough of this place. I really wanted to like this place but not after the service we received. We walked in to check in and the host looked so miserable, does she not know her job description? She was so unwelcoming and monotone but either way I decided to look past it. We waited for about 20 minutes to be seated and the guy that took us to our table just sat us down and was like your server will be here and walked away, he too looked like he hated his job. So finally our server comes and it's this young girl, she asks us what we'd like to drink and that was it, not once did she greet us or anything. We knew what we were going to get, which was the 2 for $25 deal. So we tell her and when she asks what pizza I had no idea that we had a choice I thought maybe it was like a preselected one, which I proceeded to ask her if it could be any and she's like well yeah, with some snippy attitude. She then walks away so we could have ""time to look at the choices"" which wasn't necessary at all because there weren't a lot to choose from. So the food comes out and what not and she comes to tell us she's going on lunch and that this other girl will no be our sever. This new girl was more positive and attentive. But that wasn't enough to shake off the sour experience I had had with our previous server. Overall the food isn't great and the service is horrible.

Zavanna P.,"Long Beach, CA",153,40,57,1.0,5/30/2016,"Where do I begin...My husband & I came here for our friends bday dinner at 6:50pm & were told there would be a wait of 60 to 70mins to accommodate our party of 12 which was understandable. We were finally seated at 8:20 and waited for our server to take our drinks. (10-15mins for him to take our drink orders). I kindly asked for water with lemon & an iced vanilla coffee. Our drinks came 15mins later and forgot my water with lemon. No biggie, so I kindly asked again for my water with lemon and he apologized. 15 mins later my water comes, no lemon. I kindly ask him again for a lemon while he took my food order. He apologized again and said he would be back with the lemon. For reference I ordered A bowl (not bread bowl) of Clam Chowder and fish and chips and my husband ordered a medium rare hamburger. 2 servers from the kitchen I believe come and hand out everyone's soup or salads but the order was semi mixed up. My friend had ordered a bowl of clam chowder as well as I but the servers had a bread bowl clam chowder and a bowl of clam chowder. My friend and I told them we both ordered a bowl not a bread bowl. They offered the bread bowl to either of us no up charge so my friend took it since I didn't want bread. Mix up not so bad, it happens. As I lift the spoon off my bowl I see black and brown crusty stuff on it. GROSS. I flag the waiter and he doesn't see me. I try calling for him but no luck with all the noise going on a saturday night. Waiter disappears so I patiently wait while everyone enjoys their soup or salad. 15mins pass and our waiter finally shows up and I finally get his attention. I ask him for another spoon and show him the crud on mine and he apologizes and says he would get me another one. Again I sit and wait and still no waiter. 15 mins pass and my friend flags down another waiter/server and says ""Excuse me, i'm sorry I know your not our waiter but my friend has been waiting for a spoon because the one that came with her soup had stuff on it and our waiter hasn't came back yet. All our friends are already done with their soups and salad.""  The waiter/server looks at me and says he will get me a new spoon. Before he leaves I kindly ask him ""Also, is there any way I can get my soup warmed up? Its been sitting here and has cooled down."" He looks at me annoyed and rudely says ( I SWEAR ON MY CHILDREN!) ""Sure I can warm it for you, actually do you want it like really really hot? I can make it really hot for you! Actually I'll just get you a new bowl and i'll make sure it's really hot for you! Do you want it really hot?"" I looked at him like wait, what? Was he trying to be funny or plain rude? I laugh a little and tell him ""Well no I dont want it really hot I just wanted it warmed up because it cooled down while waiting for a spoon."" He says ok and leaves. 10 minutes later he comes back with my bowl and says to me in a smart ass tone ""Here you go, is that hot enough for you? If not i'll take it back and make it super hot for you if you want. Try it and let me know if it's hot enough for you I mean thats what you want."" By this time I was fed up and just told him ""No its fine thanks."" I LITERALLY look at my husband and said ""I hope to GOD my entree doesn't come out because I barely get my soup to eat!"" 2 spoons later of soup guess what arrives...my ENTREE. I was irritated at this point. My husband tells me we will just pack up the soup to take home so I can eat my entree. Next thing you know my friend next to me flags down our waiter and asked if his meal came with 2 sides. Waiter says yes it does, my friend says he only has 1 side on plate and that the mashed potatoes were missing. The waiter apologized and went to get him his missing mashed potato. I slice into my fish & chips and guess what, the batter was soft and soggy, and the fish was wet and bland. I literally shook so much pepper and salt on it and STILL it was bland. No taste at all. 1 bite was all it took. I ate a few of the fries that were fine and pushed my meal aside. I had lost my appetite. My husband offered to share his burger with me since it was cut in half and I said no thanks. He took his first bite of the burger and was disappointed. The patty was well done, over cooked, AND dry. He was so hungry since his last meal was breakfast and he works on the weekends and barely has time for lunch breaks, that he ate half the burger then shoved the rest. He told me he didn't enjoy it at all but that he was so hungry he had to bare it. By this time we were all highly disappointed in the service and our meal. Our bday friend was the one whose side was missing from his meal. We joked about how come the first half of our table had great service and great food but the rest of us at the end of the table including the bday boy had bad service and bad food. My friend didn't even want to wait for his bday pizookie because he was just over the whole situation. We made him stay and said at least we know the pizookie has to be good!

Eve L.,"Anaheim, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/26/2015,"Today is my birthday and our family decided on BJ'S for lunch. It took about 10 minutes to be seated which was fine since we were a party of 9. Our waitress took our drink order, brought the drinks, put in our food order, then went home for the day and left us with another waitress. When they started bringing out the food we noticed our orders were all wrong. My nephews had ordered grilled cheese sandwiches with sides and were only brought small bowls of macaroni and cheese. When we let them know their order was wrong, she took away the mac and cheese and the kids didn't receive their food until we were more than halfway through our meals. My little niece never received her fruit side. Half of us ordered burgers and ordered them medium, when they got to us however they were burnt and dried out. My husband and my mother in law received the wrong burgers. They were dry with no sauces, as they were described in the menu. Our waitress came by twice in the beginning and that was it. We did not receive any refills so all of our drinks were gone by the middle of our meals. Overall I was very disappointed. Being my birthday lunch I wanted it to go well and it was the worst service I've ever experienced at a BJ'S restaurant. I definitely will not be returning to this one. Update: I emailed the BJ's employee who had commented on my review over 2 weeks ago and have yet to see an email in response.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=440

Tried to cut one, but they were so undercooked, the mushy dough just squirted out like warm butter. When the waiter came back, they said that's the way they cook them here. Uhh, no. The oil wasn't hot enough and they were severely undercooked. They offered another, but it had taken so long to get the first round, I passed. Food took a long time to come out. The wait staff tried to keep our glasses full, but we wanted food. It was busy, but they were well staffed - at least on the floor.  Second time, got seated right away. Drinks and app came out fast. Food followed and everything was on point. It wasn't busy though. Third time, drinks came right away, but after that things slowed way down. They did get the corn fritters right this time. Nice and crispy outside, light and fluffy inside. Food took awhile to come out, but it's usually done right.  Bottom line, this location is inconsistent for service and food quality. Sometimes it's fast and on point. Sometimes is sloooooooooow and the food is off.

The waiter apologetic informed me I wasn't the only table that received under cooked pasta. Yay? The manger didn't apologize a second time nor check up on us.

The hostess was calling out the wrong names (don't know why they are calling names when they have out pagers) Then a dad and son came up with lite buzzer and they took it and said ""oh sort we gave you the wrong one"" and gave them another one and sent them away. Kinda messed up. We sat down and right away we got new server, turned out we got the one that does laps but doesn't bring refills or remembers your drinks. It was a complete pain to get his attention to try and get even our water refilled.  So our spin dip arrives, they just forgot the flavor with it. We get this as a staple at BJ's and this one just lacked salt and flavor, we were seasoning our own food. The app went and again we were wishing our server would come by for any kind of refill.  On to entrées. Again messed up, my wife's gluten free pizza had extra white onions that she didn't order and was missing the artichokes she had asked for, but she was willing to live with it. (They still charged us on the bill for them, unreal) My dish was all kinds of lack of caring. I had for the honey lemon scallops. The scallops were over cooked on one side, rubbery and bland. The asparagus is limp and lame. The rice was as if it came off the bottom the of the pan, it was dried our hard and clumped together... And you guessed it missing the flavoring honey-lemon flavoring.  We got the manager, he could obviously see that my dish was a careless, rushed failure.  He offered a refire, which I took because I was starving and it wasn't a big dish to begin with. It took another 10 mins and wow what a difference, scallops looked better, asparagus was better, rice was flavored but under cooked (at least it wasn't a solid bunch of rock hard rice). I'll never be back to this location, they over charged, lacked any sort for lack of a better word...caring. No credit for two messed up dishes or lack of service.

Hey asshole, why don't you at least wait until we get our credit cards back before you start kicking us out of the joint?  I looked at my cell phone and it was 7:35, so almost exactly 2 hours since we sat down.  You really couldn't wait another 15 minutes or so for us to get our cards back so we could leave on our own?

I went with the Jeremiah Red craft beer, which is nice, if not a bit thin for a red.  Opened up napkin and silverware is spotty.  Ordered mini deep dish--mostly soggy.

I give this place 4 stars because it gets crowded and loud on the weekends (although the wait time is not bad), and the wait time after you place your order is somewhat long. Lunch specials and happy hour are a great deal, and if you are a frequent visitor, you should definitely sign up for the rewards program. The service is great. The staff is very friendly.

I ordered a sandwich and fries combo, asked for toasted bread,  but what did I get? My fries came out COLD, not even luke warm, and my toasted bread came out luke warm borderline cold.  It's not like I ordered a damn pizza. I see so many servers just chit chatting with their friends here. Flagging down the waiter to ask for the check takes over 5 minutes, getting the check takes another 10, and finally getting my change takes another 10. Seriously? You guys are not busy. I know most of the people working at this location have worked other BJ's (I can over hear the conversations). What's funny is the waiter acknowledges I'm on lunch because of the clothes I'm wearing yet they take forever when I ask for the check.

Andrea L.,"Orange County, CA",462,353,106,2.0,12/7/2015,Came here with my husband today and boy was I disappointed. Never left a BJs location with such regret. Found a hair in my food and the waitress reluctantly swapped it out. Managing to still charge us for it. Lol from all the places I've eaten at if theres a hair or insect in your food they will replace it and eat the cost. I was really nice about it but she didn't even seem apologetic about the incident. Ordered two Mojitos and the first one was great however the second time around it was extremely sweet. Completely off balanced from the initial beverage. We waited and waited for the waitress to come back however she was either extremely busy or she just did not want to come back and help us. I got fed up with waiting I brought it to the bartender and asked for a replacement. She asked who my server was and I told her she hasn't come around for the last 15 mins. After another 5 mins of waiting (still without my drink) another server comes to our table and asked if he could provide some assistance. I explained to him that there was an issue with the drink so he brought me a new one. Whenever I go to places that serve food and beverages I try to be as nice as possible since I don't like other peoples saliva in my food lol. But at this point it was just getting ridiculous. No one came around to ask if we needed any condiments or if we wanted to clear some of the (obviously empty) dishes off of our extremely tiny table. After the incident with the beverage I never saw the girl come out again. From then on it was just the male server who took care of us. I just find it a bit ironic since usually if a waiter goes on break or if there is a transition they usually come together to introduce the new person responsible for your table. Meh I guess you can't expect much for people who do not take their job seriously. The happy hour deal/hours have changed so if you're a veteran happy hour attendee for BJ's be aware of your orders. Overall I am disappointed with the services and quality of food & beverages rendered. I hope that they try to fix internal and external issues since we love BJs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=540

The wait was only about 10 minutes- we went to the bar and grabbed a beer. The service at the bar was great- very friendly and attentive right away to us. We got seated maybe 5 minutes after- once we were seated no body came to check on us till about 15 minutes after !! I had to personally ask a server if we were going to be helped. They looked confused did some side chatter and finally decided who it would be to take care of us. He was very pleasant- but maybe the hostess ladies need to communicate it better with the server before we get seated and way 15 minutes to be attended to...

I ordered what I thought was a chicken Caesar salad online for pick up.  When I arrived to pick up my food, there was no chicken on it. The cashier said it does not come with chicken and I have to add it. I told her I thought it came with chicken, because online it shows a picture of a chicken Caesar salad and I selected it. I asked for chicken, and it was about 5 bucks  in addition to the 11 dollar salad. She stuck her head into the kitchen, and brought it out right away, which means the chicken isn't cooked when ordered...The chicken wasn't even sliced for my salad.  I paid 16 bucks for a chicken Caesar salad that wasn't prepared fresh.  I'm mostly dissatisfied that the online photo depicts a picture of a Chicken Caesar salad, but does not come with chicken.. in which wastes everyone's time.  BJ's should update the website and photos to depict the actual entrees and food items. I paid over 16 bucks for lettuce, croutons and a chicken breast.  I guess lunch prices are different online.  Maybe this complaint is more at a corporate level, but the employee wasn't responsive when I showed her that its a chicken Caesar salad online... She just told me to add chicken for 5 more bucks... aside from that, the salad isn't prepared fresh... that's a no-no for a 16 dollar salad.

Hailey did a great job communication with us about our order, just so we wouldn't feel as if she forgot about it. I don't come here often (maybe once every other month) and this was by far the best customer service!

Karen E.,"Anaheim, CA",97,55,183,1.0,3/10/2014,"I am very disappointed on the service that we received from Brittney B. (African American from Jamaica) If I would I would give 0 stars for her service.  Okay I don't really go to BJ's so it took us a while to order. We ordered drinks and then was asked if we wanted an appetizer but we weren't sure so she gave us more time after who knows how many minutes she asked us what we wanted. I told her ""for appetizer we will have the California club pizza"" then can I have a bacon cheese burger with no pickles she asked me how I wanted my burger and I told her well done. It seemed like forever to get our appetizer.  Please note brittney did not write or take notes of anything we ordered.  We finally got our drinks but never got our appetizer since they brought us our food first. My hamburger was not well done! It was pink. I would have returned it but I just ate it. Brittney was more involved giving her customer service to the bigger parties especially to the table who had a guy that was a sales car person. She was more interested in making tips. She barely came to our table since we were in the middle tables. She refilled their cups of water 2-3 times while my bf and I were there, and only came once to see if we wanted anymore drinks and my bf said he wanted another beer. Well that beer took forever!  I understand that maybe she had 4 tables to assist but my boyfriend and I agreed that her service was better with the others, that had a bigger party. And this time him and I both agreed that she deserved $0 for her tip. & that's what she got I would have talked to the manager but why make a big deal out of it I'll just post it on yelp. Note to Britnney: please write down customers orders and attend them even when u have a big party. $ is $ and we would have tipped you well if you did a great job but u didn't you practically ignored us!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=480

One was dine in and one take out. When I came to dine in with 2 friends it was a Tuesday night and the place wasn't so packed, yet no one was happy. Not one person smiled at us from the host to the server. We even told them we were celebrating a birthday and they just said ""cool"". Next when I ordered pick up it was the weekend. And my order took 20 minutes over the initial time. Then the server tells me I need to pay again even tho the app showed I had paid already. I had to pull up the receipt through email and then she told me I had to repay because I had asked for an extra scoop of ice cream and she had to recharge me for it. I told her just forget about it.

Curt R.,"Orange, CA",0,7,13,1.0,7/25/2016,"Well, the kids wanted to go to BJ's and against my better judgement we gave it a try. If you are young and have not been around long enough to form an educated opinion of what good food is, or, you are an older person who just wants to be seen with the trendy crowd, then this is the right place for you. I figured it a safe bet to go with the BJ's deep dish pizza ($25) that made them famous. Well, it probably was good at one time but that time has come and gone. You would be much better off going to a place like Blaze for a third of the price for pizza. The buffalo wings were awful. In the words of my nephew ""the mashed potatoes aren't what they used to be"".

Fred H.,"Anaheim, CA",45,91,50,3.0,8/31/2014,"We came here on a Friday night with 5 people.  It was a 25 minute wait until we got seated.  The AC was cranked so high that some of us were shivering.  I know servers may be hot running around, but keep the temperature comfortable for customers. Our server is best described as uncaring.  We didn't have silverware and we had to ask twice before getting it after the food had already come out.  We asked her to take a picture of the group and she said in a minute, then went to other tables and didn't come back.  When she came back, of course she forgot and the moment was over. We ordered: 2 orders of wings, corn fritters, angel hair pasta, a Medium BBQ chicken pizza and a BJ's specially pizza. The wings are good as always, my favorite.  The corn fritters are slightly over fried and on the verge of turning burnt.  The angel hair pasta is over cooked to a point of mushiness and violating the cardinal rule of pasta.  Both pizzas were undercook and doughy.   The pizza needed to stay in the oven for a few more minutes.  We immediately brought it up to our server, who offered to have kitchen put it back in the oven.  After realizing we were not happy with her response she asked if we wanted to see the manager, we told her yes. The manager is very nice and offered to re-make the pizzas right away.  15 minutes  later, fresh ones were brought out.  The dough was better but the pizza didn't taste very good.  It's nowhere near comparable to the HB location.  At this point, we all regretted and vowed to only go BJ's in HB moving forward.  Throughout, the manager came back a few times to check up on us.  He offered us complimentary dessert on the house as an apology.  We had the undeniably delicious pizookie.  Because of the manager's efforts, i gave it a 3 stars, otherwise would have been a 1 star. Summary:  terrible pizza, terrible pasta, didn't enjoy the service from waitress, but the manager is very nice and accommodating.  I would not come back to this location.  Until they change the quality of the food and service, we'll only visit Huntington Beach location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=480

I asked him why my dish doesn't have mushrooms and he said because its in the sauce. Umm then why is it showing in the photo on the menu? So in a RUDE way, he said ""do you want mushrooms?"" I said well I wanted it cooked with my meal, not on the side what the heck am I gonna do with a side of blan mushrooms. Then again with an attitude and rolling his eyes looking annoyed he asked if ""I want mushrooms or not."" VEEEEEEEERY rude considering it is not my fault the maker of the menu included mushrooms in the dish. He completely forgot about our table of 10, never got refills nothing. And we were later charged with a $22 tip he did not deserve. If anything we should have gotten a comp for his nasty attitude.

When we got to the restaurant, the hostess in the front said it would be a ""30 minute wait."" I understand the dinner rush and I have no problem with waiting, but my patience is thin when the hosts seat other large groups BEFORE us who checked in minutes after we arrived. My family and I waited for an hour until I took the liberty of walking through the restaurant to the restroom to see how busy it is. SO MANY BOOTHS AND TABLES were open and just as many waiters and waitresses walked around casually as if it is a slow night. I finally requested for one of the empty booths and they hesitated and wanted to make us wait more for a table that is ""currently being cleaned."" I hate being THAT person, but I was stern with the him and said the empty booth is fine. When the host directed another hostess to finally seat us, my mom asked why it took so long to get seated. I'm furious about the fact that (1) my mom was ignored and not given an answer, (2) the curly haired hostess rolled her eyes at my mom and had the indecency to not smile the entire time that she brought us to our table and give us our silverware and menus, and (3) its my mom's birthday TODAY... (Thanks for making starting off our dinner horribly.) On the brightside, our server Alicia G. was very sweet from beginning to end. She took care of us and helped make my mom's birthday special.

The girls ordered a burger and pizza and hubby had a pizza, too. She asked what I was having and I said I'm eating what I ordered from the hh menu. She brought out my order from the hh menu. Which was 5 buffalo wings and 2orders of avocado eggrolls. Which one order of eggrolls was for the girls to try. Everyone started eating my wings...grr! Ah, hello...those were my meal. Whatever...they were barely warm. Not good. It took forever for everyone's food to come out...like almost an hour. Then when it comes...its wrong. I was pissed to say the least. We had to leave soon and my neice was starving.  The reason why I was so pissed is because we stopped the waitress before putting in the order to inquire about what was on the burger my neice ordered and then she ends up with a completely different burger. I don't know many kids who would order a blue cheese burger.  The manager came to say sorry and offered dessert but we were running so late.

We also noticed people seating outside... Which, the hostess explained to us that there was no servers outside. I asked to speak to a manager, because of that observation. Jesse, the manager on duty, came over, and I explained my frustration. He apologized, but his reasoning didn't seem to make sense. We were not satisfied customers at that point, but we decided to stay anyway. Once he took our order down, our actual server didn't come check on us.

There was so much grime in between the pages of the menus we received, you could feel all the stickiness and hear it too.Our ""server"" took our order and then he wasn't our server anymore? I'm just as confused as you are. Our order was taken and many times he walked by not acknowledging us and our empty drinks. I also asked for horseradish and steak sauce which never came as i'm 3/4 done eating. Yeah, it's a Sunday night I understand that it is busy but if you are working a Sunday night, you should know how to do it right. It was hard to get anyone's attention. When i finally got another server's attention at the END of our meal she then told us ""oh i'm actually going to be your server now"". Note: it's not like the guy who took our order went home, he was still in the restaurant walking back and forth.

I had some friends come down and along w/ my girlfriend & we were looking for a good time...We were horribly wrong. The waiter jokingly stated while taking our initial order, ""I'm not that good honestly"". He was right. After waiting 15 minutes for drinks, he forgot to put our appetizer order in. ""Oh I'm sorry I forgot, i'll be right back"". Okay so I can forgive that...at least he brought my drink!  We finally enter our main course order...my girlfriend SPECIFICALLY made sure she stated her order to our waiter. He even read it back to us. After waiting what seemed like over 30 minutes (mind you the restaurant was maybe at 55% capacity), her order was wrong again! He again stated, ""Im sorry guys its my fault. I said I'm not good haha"" I half-jokingly said ""Yes...we are starting to see that""  Meanwhile another young lady seemed to clean up his mess pretty well after coming off her break by completing our dinner service with a more experienced feel. All the meanwhile our other server was taking selfies with other customers...Guess some people don't realize who exactly you may be serving.. All in all I've normally never experienced bad customer service since I am a pretty frequent diner at BJ's but this one I definitely will not be back to. Most of the staff sat around talking while you could clearly see the other servers struggling w/ orders, seating, etc. If your looking for something quick and easy try Dave & Busters or El Toritos.

Ian K.,"Santa Ana, CA",183,262,963,1.0,3/5/2014,"200th Review - Disappointing experience for my friend's birthday. This past weekend my friend decided to have a group lunch for about 20 people. I had a bad feeling but hoping I was wrong, and was I? Nope! So if you have a large group, half of the group has be present, makes sense no issue there. I kindly asked the waitress to change the channel to the NHL Heritage Classic (Senators vs. Canucks). She said she'd check with her manager, fair enough but didn't bother to get back to us. My friend had to ask another waitress, and guess what it got changed. Just say no, if you don't want to do it (Haha). BJ's is known for their pizza, but I decided to choose something else - Mahi Mahi Tacos. Oh boy, bad decision! The Mahi Mahi is a new menu item and needs to be removed from the menu. The tacos were not flavorful, chicken was undercooked, and just plain disgusting. I should of went with the overpriced pizza or just stayed away from all the food menu items. The group ordered various items from burgers to pizzas. My friend sitting next to me ordered a calamari sample, and that was horrible as well. It wasn't only me because she told prior to me trying it wasn't good. When it came time for the bill, the waitress added 3 ""Scooby Snacks"" to our bill, which we didn't order. Thankfully we checked the bill before just handing our credit cards over. The waitress asked us if we wanted to close out with here or pass it someone else. We told her we would with her since she was the server and guess who shows up someone else. So we had to re-explain the bill to her and ensured $5 was taken off because I had an online coupon. Why ask if you are going to do what you want? Moving right along, it was an unpleasant experience. BJ's will not be on my list to have a drink or get a bite. FYI - the HH menu sucks. It shouldn't be called HH. This place is overrated, avoid. Go down to TGIF's. Much better menu items and service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=520

I understand getting friendly with your coworkers and talking to each other during your down time but they were extremely inattentive and rude. We walked in and they barely paid any attention to us and kept talking to each other and then when they finally noticed us one of the girls just dropped us at the nearest table and rushed back to finish her conversation without saying anything to us.  This Bj's would have better reviews  if they trained their staff properly and reminded them that they are there to work and not to socialize.

Our lunch came and the food was very disappointing.  The tacos were dry, probably from sitting under the heat lamps while my friends food was being prepared.  No big deal as I was really there to see my friend, not for the food.   Then the bill came...she charged me $9.50 for the tacos instead of the menu price of $5.75!  I asked another employee about it, as my server had already left, and she said the extra $4.00 was for the fish.  I was shocked!!  I specifically ordered ""lunch tacos""... She tricked me by asking if I wanted the fish or shrimp, which I now know are not part of the lunch menu. (apparently lunch tacos are only chicken which I would have been fine with).   I did not want to get into an uncomfortable situation with my friend there so I paid the bill, left her a very small tip and wrote a note on the ticket telling her I didn't appreciate the 'bait and switch' game she just pulled on me.

Anthony C.,"Orange, CA",113,9,9,3.0,11/9/2013,"Stopped in for a bite last night, here is my review: it was about 6pm and it was packed. Had to wait about 20-25 minutes to be seated so we thought we'd grab a drink at the bar while we wait. The bar was packed, took about 10 minutes before there was any sort of opening, even then it was just a small split between some people sitting at the bar. I had wave down a bartender and then shout my beer from 2 people back. She asked me to come around to the side so she could hear.  They have these cool electronic boards next to the bar that rotate between the happy hour menu/times, special deals, seasonal beers, and their own bottled beer so you can take home your favorites! I asked for their seasonal Nit Wit that I saw on the board. She said they didn't have it because it was a seasonal. I guess I should've known better that their witbier was not a fall seasonal. She proceeded to inform me that the seasonal was a pumpkin ale or an oktoberfest. Neither of these were on the board at all. I had the Pumpkin ale and was satisfied. We were seated, and I was alarmed to see that their Filet Mignon (which is why I came here) was not on the menu. I asked the server and he confirmed that the Filet was being removed from the menu. He did offer to check if they still had some because it was a recent change. We ordered the Jeremiah Red and Santa Fe Rolls. He came back with the appetizers and beers as well as bad news: they were done with the Filets. We ordered the Ribeye with red wine mushroom sauce and a peanut butter pazookie. The service was great! He was attentive, went out of his way to help us and made great suggestions for beer and food pairings. Overall:  Service at the bar could've been better (possibly due to the volume of customers) Service in the dining room was fantastic! Beer was great as usual Bad news: Filet is gone :( Good News: Thursdays have affordable brews in addition to the Happy Hour Now you can get Jeremiah in a bottle! -Chewie",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=560

Aside from that, I'd say the rest of the food is for the most part solid but has room for improvement.  The portions are fair and the presentation is nice but for some reason I just can't give it  a 5.  Maybe its a lack of freshness or maybe its because I'm not a big fan of American food.  I know one thing for sure is that I ordered a chicken soup and was very disappointed at the little amount I received.  On another occasion, I ordered the pulled pork bbq sandwich and it was enjoyable The main reason I go honestly is for the dessert.  I really enjoy the beignets with ice cream as well as the pizzookie.  Which is basically a cookie with ice cream on top. Service is very polite and friendly. The food  however takes quite a while to bring simply because the restaurant is so big and busy. Pricing is a little on higher side of fairly priced but I suppose you are also paying for the environment and ambiance.

People that had been there the same time as us were all in already and I expected us to be next, but then people that got there after us were being let in, even people with bigger parties or the same amount as us! I only had a party of 3! I went in to the host and asked why is it taking so long and she said I'm still on the waiting list, I waited an hour longer and nothing! And I actually never got the text one is supposed to receive when your table is ready. What made it worse is that it ruined what was supposed to be my younger sister's birthday dinner. We ended up going home upset and just ate cereal. Thanks a lot BJ's we now forever hate you for ruining a birthday!

Swathy S.,"Chino Hills, CA",137,87,30,1.0,8/31/2013,"Me and my bf love the pizza at Bjs so we go here pretty often. This was our first time at the location in Orange. I knew it was a new location as I work across the street. We went to the movies and got out around 11.00 and we knew Bjs was open till late so we decided to head over to get the gourmet veggie deep dish pizza. My bf was craving it all day so I wanted him to get it before we headed home. We got seated in a timely manner. Our waiter was very friendly as well. He just wasnt too aware of the vegetarian options they had. I ended up ordering a pasta and my bf got the pizza.  Our food took about 40 mins and when they brought it out I saw a piece of chicken in my plate when I actually ordered a veggie pasta. On top of that they forgot to add artichokes and basil to my bfs pizza. So they took it back and the manager came to us apologizing, almost every 5mins we had someone come up to our table and apologize for the mistake. It kind of got annoying  because everyone around us kept watching.  Finally after another 30min wait, they brought the right order and as the guy was serving us he drops the first slice of pizza on the table AHHHH!!! how bad can this experience get. We just stayed quiet and tried to enjoy our dinner. Our waiter then comes to inform us that the dinner was on the house and that they were sorry for all that happened. We just paid for the 2 drinks we ordered and left.  I remember checking the time we left and it was 1:30am. So warning for everyone going here: waiters are barely learning their menu, they are very sloppy, expect a long wait for your food and drinks and do not expect the best service either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=560

The only positive thing I could say about this restaurant is that every once in a blue moon I might have to send my order back only once. I have been here thirteen times now including two birthdays. There has been one occasion where everything worked like a charm and everyone was happy. I am sitting here now waiting for my pizza to be cooked. Oh wait this was over an hour ago. The first time waiter error (ok I get that it's fine). The second time they put the wrong toppings on the pizza. It's a very slow night so I figured they were just goofing off. The waiter claims it was mixed up with someone elses. The third time the crust was so crunchy the texture and bite felt like I was eating Pringles, PRINGLES!! Anyways over an hour and a half in and I was expecting to be in and out in half an hour. On a good day expect an hour minimum. When the final pizza came it was undercooked and had an excessive amount of cheese on it. I won't even bother coming back to this location nor order desert because all of my night is now wasted.               Sincerely,         A dedicated member of bjs with 1500+ loyalty points.       Ps: I won't miss the undercooked food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=560
Christy N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",28,15,1,5.0,1/17/2014,"Love this place. Love the atmosphere. love the food and love the people who work here. I go here often with my colleagues after work and it is such a welcoming environment all thanks to the very attentive and friendly manager, Kevin. He is a true professional and he makes sure that our orders comes out perfectly. We usually order a bunch of appetizers to share: boneless wings, ahi poke, avocado egg rolls, spinach stuffed mushrooms. Well, our server accidentally brought out the traditional wings instead and Kevin immediately came to the rescue and like a true professional fixed our order while managing to convince us that the traditional wings were better. He was right after eliciting a few laughs from us and we ended up ordering another round of appetizers based on Kevin's enthusiastic recommendations. (He was too convincing and likable not to disagree!)  BOTTOM LINE: if you want to relax after work with good food, good company and a very welcoming atmosphere, come to BJ's and make sure that Kevin is there... Because he WILL take care of you, will engage you with his personable demeanor AND will make sure that you are having a good time!!!  A true professional in every sense of the word.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=560

His name is Kevin. Normally it wouldn't bother me, since I'm at a bar. However; Kevin was having a full on conversation with the guy to my left. Fine, but manager Kevin put his arm on the back of my chair hitting my back. I pretend to sit back so he can leave my chair alone. But as soon as I lean forward, he'd be on my chair. So annoying. He apologize to me every time he bumped into me, but still. You're a manager talk to your friend another time. How can I enjoy my meal if you keep bumping into me. -0- California burger - tasteless. Bland. Heinz did however came to the rescue. At that point it was eatable. -0- Clam chowder - decent tiny bits of clam not bad -3- Caesar salad - nice but not great.

Art S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",108,73,10,1.0,8/18/2013,"For a restaurant that just opened in a new location it does not help itself by hiring bartenders that take forever in serving you a beer. Ten minutes for me to sit in the bar area and still not have my beer that I asked for is unacceptable.  Not sure if our bartender lacked the communication skills to serve us or hated his job all I can say is that we did not expect the type of service that I received on Thursday night.  For a BJs restaurant, I always enjoyed their freshly brewed beers and their delicious plates at other locations including the customer service.  I know this restaurant is in a new area and all, maybe they don't need to worry about the demand but once people start noticing that the service blows here, customers are going to take their cash elsewhere.  Anyways, I will not be returning to this BJs and if I do, I will demand that I get a different bartender, that's for sure.

I work down the street from this new bjs and ordered a California chicken sandwich (which they no longer have it's a California chicken club now) on the curbside take out for my 30 minute lunch break. I got the sandwich and it was completely the wrong sandwich, not even close. So I went back in and talked to the lady at the to-go station. It took FOREVER for me to get my sandwich (mind you I only have a 30 minute lunch.) When I did get the sandwich I started to drive over to my work which is literally down the street and I only had about 10-15 minutes to eat now so I started to eat on the way back to work. THANK GOD I opened the sandwich. There were hairs ALL OVER. Now, I shouldn't say hairs because only God knows what it was but there were TONS of auburn colored hair-like things all over the sandwich. Because they were tiny straight hairs, it could have been mistaken for pubes. So extremely upset and NOW NOT ABLE TO EAT FOR 8 HOURS, I went back to the manager who went back to the cooks and said there were no cooks there with that color hair so she had no idea where it came from. She gave me a 30 dollar gift card and offered me a free salad or soup to go since I had not eaten on my lunch but I just didn't have time. SO THERES MORE. Me and my boyfiend decide to go to the Cerritos Bjs and to no avail.. The gift cards don't work!!!! We had to wait another 30 minutes just so that the Cerritos manager could get in contact with the Orange manager. Finally we had gotten everything cleared and we got our free meal.

Next my group of 5 ordered some beers with the exception of 1 he is under 21, the server then got us the beer and took down our food order, next thing we know he accused us of giving our under age friend our beer simply because the beer was near him! (um yeah I'm sitting next to him where do you want me to put my beer?) i mean he could have just asked that i move my beer or something but he was almost yelling at us. And once our food arrived he didn't give us utensils to eat with had to ask him twice all the while our food is sitting getting cold!

I'm just going to put what I wrote to corporate: I'm writing to tell you the worst experience and worst customer service I have ever had at BJ's. My bf and I decided to go to BJ's in Orange yesterday at 3pm to celebrate my new job. We ordered calamari and corn fritters for appetizers and those were delicious and came out to us in no time. Disaster struck when our small half bbq chicken pizza and half bj's favorite pizza was brought to out table. Melissa M. our server placed it on the table and my bf and I spoke up and said the bbq chicken side does not look right. It was missing cilantro and red onions. And her solution was to bring us some cilantro but said if it tasted weird she would replace it for us. My bf and i were starving so we decided to just try it anyway since the other half was okay. IT WAS DISGUSTING. Worst pizza ever and you could not even taste the bbq sauce. When Melissa came back to check on us we told her it was disgusting and said, ""I'm sorry guys that sucks,"" and walked away. As a loyal customer to BJ's for 4years it was extremely insulting. And every time I've had problems with my food, the server would replace it with no questions asked. But at this one, she said she would replace it if it was disgusting, we told her it was disgusting, and she did  nothing about it. And to top it all off when she was leaving the check she tried so hard to upsell us on dessert because she knew the pizza was so bad so ,"" have some dessert to make it better."" NO THANKS. The only reason we didn't bring this up to a manager is because our appetizers filled us up enough to just say f"""""" it.

The people who did receive their food at my table couldn't start eating because we had no utensils. We finally flag down somebody for utensil and it took way too long for them to get back. They have a promotional deal on pazookies that we requested. We we're told that it was only one pazookie per table when on the promotional ad it says per check and we were all paying separately. Then we were avoided for another 20 minutes until they brought the last dish to our table. We flagged down our waiter and asked to speak to a manager. The manager takes another 20 minutes to approach and she seemed like she had a bad attitude the minute she approached our table. We told her about the poor service and how unsatisfied we were with it. She apologized grudgingly and offered us boxes for our food. She judged wanted us to leave which seemed pointless for us because we just got our food. We then asked her to put in the order for all of our pazookies ( this is the second time asking because we had already told our original waiter sam to do it) and she gives us the "" it's only one per table but because of how long the wait was I will do that"". I wasn't going to further argue that she wasn't doing me a courtesy and that she obviously had no clue what the promotional ad promised. 15 minutes later we ask another waiter to get us our waiter since we were being avoided. Now we have a new waiter and we asked him about our pazookie order that was suppose to be put in by the manager. This is our third time ordering the pazookies and we are being constantly told that it's ""almost"" out. We asked for our check and again we were avoided for another 20 minutes. Then the waiter comes with no pazookies and only our check. We never got the pazookies and it was ridiculous how the manager handled the whole situation.

It was one of the worst burgers I've ever put in my mouth. The double patties were oozing with grease with absolutely no flavor. All you tasted was grease. Everything else on the burger was hidden because of the overpowering crappiness of the meat. I ended taking out a patty but still same crappy taste. (0 stars).

Ti K.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/29/2016,"So i wasn't happy which goes to show you that even chain stores are run differently by each management team. I am a regular customer at bj's in general and like the place to eat. When I arrived, I was greeted by a tattooed gang member who had obviously just been released from the jail across the street aggressively panhandling. The employees should have seen this as it was 5 feet from their front door. I ordered an appetizer which was dropped off by a server, but without utensils. It sat on the table for 15 minutes getting cold before any server came by. The utensils showed up a few minutes later, and I sent the cold appetizers back. The meal showed up, which was a salmon dish over Cous Cous and asparagus. The asparagus was NOT trimmed, so I had to fight with the woody stems with every bite. The Cous Cous was over cooked and the bottom of the dish was under water, as if the salmon was served over wet, undrained pasta. After my meal was finished, the appetizer showed up again for dessert. There was no offer to comp that item, and again, at least one of us at the table had no utensils to eat the appetizer with since he had ordered a sandwich and no utensils were ever delivered for his meal. I paid full price for a total amature presentation, poor execution of the food and service that made me feel like no one could give a rip. I gave 2 stars only because of my prior food experiences at other bj's.

Then the crispy veggie flatbread pizza was only crisp on edges and kinda soggy and limp in the middle - I eat a lot of pizza and a lot of vegetarian and this did not measure up.

Madiya M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,53,7,1.0,8/13/2014,"Let me start by saying that I've been coming to BJs for a while now.. 5 years to be exact. And I've noticed a continued decline in their customer service over the years. But this location has to be one of the worst ones I've encountered yet! I give it a 1 star because the manager ""tried"" to rectify the problems (plural) Short version: rude staff (hosts and servers combined), major communication issues between servers and cooks which results in incorrect orders, inability to cater to large parties and lastly, slow inconsistent service! Long version: Party of 20.. Took about an 1:40 minutes just to be seated (random Tuesday with half the restaurant empty) not a big deal.. Since there were 20 of us, we entertained each other outside on a beautiful evening. Once we get seated, we get introduced to Juan and the drinks start rolling in. We order apps and while they tasted good, they took about 40 mins to come out to us. We ordered about 4 spinach and artichoke dips, all of them were half empty. No worries, we ask the waiter to fill them up. He takes the dips away and disappears for another 20 mins while the chips get cold. And the only reason it took 20 mins was because we had to remind him. Food starts coming out (most of the orders were wrong). And then were told the missing dishes would be on their way (another 20 mins) so half the party was eating and the other half was watching. Our waiters response ""umm yah this was big party"" so ur establishment can't cater properly to a big party? The biggest failure of the night, bits of pepperoni on vegetarian pizzas that we accidentally ate!!!! Any vegetarian will tell u how big of a no no that is. Not only was our meal ruined but our snooty waiter tells us ""oh that happens sometimes since the toppings are next to each other"" ummmm wat???? That's the best bs u can come up with??

Mike A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",18,5,,1.0,8/5/2013,"I've been to several other BJ's in the area, but this one is certainly the worst experience I've had.

Long story short, we were told that there was a 2-hour maximum on tables, even though they don't take reservations to begin with. The waitresses and bartenders were great but the manager was mostly rude. He  stopped by our table twice for something that I've never experienced. He said he was unable to serve us more drinks unless we identified our designated driver. We identified her and then he said ""OK"" and let us start ordering again. (one shot later) He then stopped by the 2nd time and said that he was unable to serve any more drinks for the remainder of the evening. He did not give any reasoning as to how he arrived at this decision. Mind you, we weren't loud or obnoxious. It was pretty disappointing since we were looking forward to having a spot to hang out after a long week of work on Friday nights. Hopefully this clown gets replaced soon...

We finally decided to give BJs another shot tonight but the one in Orange to avoid bad service. We were unable to avoid the bad service. We got sat and didn't get started until after a table that got sat after us had been started. Why? Who knows. We ordered an appetizer and sides for our meals, the sides came out with our appetizer. The person bringing out the food, was sweating, he wasn't carrying a tray and his hands were all up in our food. One of our dishes (the actual food) was even rubbing up against his shirt. Extremely unsanitary! After we received our food, our server checked on us once and we never saw her again until she came to tell us it was last call. To finish it off, when we tried to pay, she took over 15 min to come back and pick up the check to run it because she was doing her side work.

Not the typical BJ's.  The employees seem angry and put out serving you which really makes for an uncomfortable dining experience.  I ordered a Pepsi and I could taste the aspartame and knew instantly it was a diet drink. I can't stand the after taste of any diet beverage and I recognized it instantly. I asked the server if I could get regular because I accidentally received diet. She was instantly annoyed and offended. The second drink tasted the same. I had my son, daughter and husband taste it and they all confirmed it was definitely diet. I literally did not want to tell the server because I knew it would be a problem.  When she came back I asked for an ice tea and said there was still something wrong with it. She got very defensive stating aggressively it was regular Pepsi causing my whole family to respond that it was definitely diet. I said I can definitely taste the aspartame but maybe the lines were switched to the machine.  She seemed baffled by that comment and my husband and I both said we used to work in a restaurant where that happened often, but either way, can I just get an ice tea? Begrudgingly I got a tea. My husband ordered broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl which had 3 full spoonfuls of soup. Total waste of money there. He asked for crackers to go with the soup and never received them. The final cherry on the cake was the server talking to other employees and pointing  at our table and laughing.  Keep laughing because eventually you won't have a job when you no longer have customers.  I won't ever come back to this location. It's expensive enough eating out and tipping a crappy server.  Why waste my hard earned money on this type of service. We could not wait to get out of there.

It was a hot day and I thought it was a great idea to get a frosty drink and perhaps a pizza.  The location is beautiful and bustling.  Seated right away, already noticing not much air conditioning, not so great. Had a first day waiter but he had his trustee trainer along for the ride.  We ordered the handcrafted sodas which took some time to arrive and tasted great but were served with NO ICE, WHAT?  I ordered an individual pizza with a topping you can't get just anywhere: roasted brussels sprouts and a wedge salad.  My friend ordered the ribs and asparagus.  First the wedge comes out on a plate the size of a small teacup saucer, hanging all over the edges.  If you're a wedge salad fan you know you need to cut it up to eat it, right?  No room on this wanna-be plate to do anything.  So I waited for my pizza to come so I could use that plate.  The pizza comes, it is all misshapen, sort of like a hexagon where the two halves were sliding in different directions.  The waiter says ""Oh, sorry, they were playing around with it back there in the kitchen.""  WTF?  Okay, the shape shouldn't matter if it tastes good, yes?  No sauce, little sausage and the star of the show brussel sprouts were  only cut in halves and burnt like bad toast.  No flavor, little rocks, they were.  I ate enough to make room on my plate for the salad and ate the rest of that.  Over on my friend's plate, the asparagus were skinny and so limp it was sad.  She did say she enjoyed the ribs.  First time I have not taken the rest of a pizza home!! Not planning to return to this location, even though it's the closest for us.  Back to Brea, hopefully the quality has not dropped off there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=620

Sofia A.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/1/2015,"I ordered a watermelon salad and a grilled salmon. The salmon came out burnt in the outside and raw in the center. I'm not a big fan of sushi; so, raw salmon is very unappealing to me. I started to eat the salad and asked our waitress if she could please ask them to cook the salmon a little more. She said I can ask them to make you another. I refused and said it is okay if they cook it a bit longer on the grill. I should've listen to her.  When the salmon came back, it was piping hot. I sure sign that it had been thrown in the microwave. The top was burnt and dry. The salad was covered in waterlike red substance and the lettuce once crispy was a soggy cooked mess. The watermelon chunks had shrunk to half their size and were hot, further proof that the entire plate had been thrown in the microwave without regard of how the crispy greens or watermelon would be affected. Frankly, I don't know why people work as chefs in a restaurant if the passion to cook is not in them. Why serve your customer something so gross?! Our server was nice and did a good job taking care of us; so, I didn't want to make an issue about it. But if you go to BJs at the Block of Orange, and you do not like your food cause it is raw; take your server's advice and do not send it back.

I can't deal with that when i have an impatient toddler. We were told our steaks took so long because they didn't have it or forgot to put it on the grill. Waitress never came back to check on us so we couldn't ask for water or a least have out son's meal brought out first. When our steaks finally came out it was dry and tasteless.

Never have I ever had such terrible service in my life. As soon as we walked in we didn't feel welcomed at all and was told the table was going to be just a moment, to there was no tables, then it was going to be 30 minutes. Then there was immediate seating when our sixth person arrived and she asked for the table? Confused yet? So were we. Anyways it took Lucas, our absolutely awful server, twenty minutes to not even greet us but to rudely walk up to the table and ask ""what do you want to drink?"" As our time went on we never once received refills, plates, silver wear, napkins, anything. Nor did he ask us if everything was okay, which it obviously wasn't. This calamari was oddly off that night to say the least and we weren't pleased at all but he didn't know that until we asked to speak to a manger finally.

Dennis D.,"Anaheim, CA",1,15,1,1.0,4/11/2015,"Really?  I stopped in tonight for a quick bite after the baseball game.  I was seated in about five minutes with ease; sometimes the wait can be quite long, even late in the evening.  The food server came to get my order within five minutes.  Again a good sign.  I ordered the deep dish lasagna - which is not lasagna, it's some stacked ravioli, but is a good dish I have had at another location about a month ago. The server disappeared having done her duty in the failure of a ""team service""  concept. Fifteen minutes later the team food slinger plopped down the dish with the welcoming, cheerful and unconscious service-oriented phrase, ""lasagna?""  and then also quickly disappeared.  So quick after the fling that it was only then I realized I had no silverware, no napkin, no nothing. Really? Is this anyone's job ""on the team"" or am I supposed to eat with my hands? TEN minutes after staring at my food and trying to hail a ""food server"" of any kind from any where, the original food server - at least I think it was she, our interaction had been so brief 20 minutes earlier during the ""ordering"" phase - stops by and says ""Oh, they didn't bring you any silverware?""  No apology, no concern... really?  I was so disgusted tha all I could do was ask for a box.  I could have taken the now cold food home and reheat it myself.  And I have forks and napkins at home...  Then my good sense kicked in.  Hey, wait a minute... this is supposed to be a restaurant... I simply got up and left the cold, utensil-less, uneaten food on the bare table for the food server to figure out.  Maybe they could find a patron who brings their own utensils and napkins and a microwave and serve it to them.  She probably never knew; most likely the team busser came by and just threw the food and sinful service away.

Joel R.,"Orange, CA",1,17,,1.0,2/28/2015,"It pains me to write this review, but you deserve it.  I like BJs very much. I eat there frequently. Because I eat there frequently I joined their rewards program. I have a smartphone app that let's me check In at the hostess so they know I'm in the rewards program and it keeps track of my points. What's really cool is the mobile pay feature. It let's you pay your check from your phone and just leave. At least in theory.  Today I had lunch with my family at this location. Checked in with my app at the hostess. We ordered and ate a tasty lunch. I asked the server to apply the $10 off I earned with reward points. I paid the boll with my mobile pay app. I even calculated the top I gave the server on the prediscounted amount. Didn't want to short him. My family and I leave to get in our car. WHY IS OUR SERVER CHASING US INTO THE PARKING LOT LIKE WE STOLE SOMETHING? Because he thought we skipped out on the check. I told him I used mobile pay. He wanted to see it on my phone. At that point, I got angry. I asked for the manager. After a protracted wait, a young lady came out to speak to me. I explained what happened and asked why I was chased into the parking lot by the server. She said ""sorry, he should have known you paid."" That's it. Thank you Captain Obvious!   Attention BJ's Corporate folks: You need to do a better job training your servers how to handle mobile pay transactions. Chasing your loyal customers into the parking lot after they pay their check really leaves a bad taste after a nice meal. And before you let anyone in your store represent themself as a manager, how about a little customer service  training. Just a little. The young lady I encountered had none.  Overall, your great loyalty program upset a loyal customer today because your people were unable or unwilling to do their jobs properly.

They fixed it...bringing out BJ'S favorite w olives..... manager asked for our opinion...told him what happen n they did apologize n gave us free desert. 2nd time Me and my friend each ordered an ahi salad and finished it.  Our server walked by and stated ""dang you killed the plate didn't you.

She brought it back in and few minutes later our server came to us blaming the kitchen stating she put in Cobb salad. We finished our pizza waited n waited and finally Cobb salad came out w the wrong dressing.  Gal A then apologized stating our server had written down house salad before. (This is a HUGE deal.

Patricia B.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,1,,2.0,5/12/2014,"So disappointed in our meal and service tonight. Server was slow, we had to ask for silver wear, napkins and not once did he refill our waters. Only once did he check on is during our meal and the table was overflowing with dishes since he never removed our appetizer or our main dish plates once empty.  Then there was the food.  My husband and I each ordered a deep dish pizza and both were pretty substandard compared to what we are use to receiving at Bj's. Some slices were huge while others were a tiny sliver and it was 3/4 crust with a small circle of toppings in the very middle which made the pizza very soggy since everything was concentrated in one spot. Then at the end of the meal we asked for 3 pizzokies... Meaning the trio however our server brought out 3 separate and large pizzokies which upped our bill another $20 so that was sucked but partially our fault since we must not have communicated what we wanted well enough.  My mother in-law ordered salmon and seemed happy with her meal so at least one of us enjoyed our meal.

My wife and I had planned on eating breakfast and watching our favorite NFL team play this morning before we hit up the shops at the block! We arrived at 10:45am and were seated in the bar where we asked if the Packer game was going to be on any of the large TV's. We requested to have the packer game played on one of the big screens and were told that she would check because someone may have requested their game. At that time there were six people in the bar area, my wife and I included! As we sat and waited our waitress told us that her manager was on the phone and would ask her when she is off if she could change the game on one of the screens... As more people came in they also asked to have the packer game played on one of the large screens! This did NOT happen! However, after 25 minutes of waiting, without our food coming out either, a group of three people came into the bar and asked for one of the TV's to play their game, the Jets!!! And they changed the channel for THEM ALMOST IMMEDIATELY! My wife and I were so upset we walked out and walked over to Saddle Ranch! The games were evenly spread out and the service was much better! BJs in Orange has lost our business clearly for the fact that they did not show any urgency to customers who had been seated first, waiting and making clearly simple requests! No communication, no apology, no attempt to even offer us another table in the dining room by a tv that could also have been changed to play the Packer game... Over 30 minutes and NO FOOD, NO GAME, terrible customer service as a whole!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=760
Enjoli P.,"Tustin, CA",32,18,10,4.0,11/24/2013,although our appetizer wasn't quite right and they ran out of the steak let me say this location excels at customer service.

I cannot say enough about how impressed I was with their service when things don't go perfectly. That is how you can tell the true value of customer service.

Stephanie D.,"Anaheim, CA",4,27,12,3.0,11/20/2013,"Treat night out with my daughter! Had a fabulous mini make-it-yourself - LOVE the deep dish crust - omg! Sooo yummy! Very nice server. Piranha pale ale - pretty good. Nice flavor. However, one of my biggest pet peeves is when someone brings out a kids meal and says, ""careful, the plate is hot"" - really? Then why would you give that to a kid? Just plain stupid. So I asked for a cool plate to put the dinner on so my child could eat her meal without fear. Then, we both enjoyed the rest if the meal - and an absolutely amazing Bizookie! Other than the bonehead who served a child a hot plate (mine was cool, figures), the meal was great!

Our server didn't even greet us or come by for about 10 minutes till finally I had a feeling this guy was it since he kept walking by and looking back. It's a Monday night and the place was NOT busy. Finally Juan was our server and came by. First thing that happened he acted like we had just sat down and was over all just RUDE. I may be a younger adult  but I am in the business and still deserve to be treated with respect. Secondly he drops our silver ware roll up on the ground, picks it up and puts it back on our table. He asked me what I wanted to drink and I asked for a ""de-caffeinated"" iced tea. He asked me what's that?"" I then said most iced teas have caffeine do you have one without. He  said none of them did which I KNEW was wrong. I just ordered the tropical because he was so clueless. Sorry if you work in the restaurant you should know which, if any teas are de-caffeinated . Finally we ordered our food, and had the food runner or expo get us everything we needed. He then came by and asked if we needed anything else. Both our drinks were a sip away from empty. Should you really have asked??? We finished quickly because our service was so bad. Food was great as always but wow we were treated so poorly.

Nhi Thao M.,"Santa Ana, CA",110,243,1810,3.0,8/31/2013,"My co-workers took me out for a birthday luncheon a couple of weeks ago at this new BJ's restaurant.  We had a reservation for sixteen people.  When we arrived, we ended up being seated at two separate tables of eight that were parallel to each other instead of one long table of sixteen.  My co-worker who made the reservation was a bit disappointed and told the hostess that she was told that we would have one table, not two.  The hostess went to ask the manager, and the manager came out and said that it was easier to seat our group at two different tables because it would be easier to have two separate waiters to each take care of one smaller table than to do one big table, which would take longer to serve.  I didn't really understand that explanation and neither did some of my co-workers (honestly, it just seemed like bad customer service), but we ended up sitting at two separate tables because we didn't want to make a big deal of it.  The waiter who served the table that I ended up eating at was pretty friendly and funny.  I ordered the Black and Bleu flatbread pizza sans the cheese (so it had marinated skirt steak, caramelized onions, flame grilled Portobello mushrooms, roasted red bell peppers and fresh thyme).  It was a good portion for lunch for one person - I originally was going to get the half-pizza with salad, but my other co-worker said that a half-pizza might not be enough, and I ended up being glad I ordered the full pizza because I finished the entire thing and didn't feel overly stuffed at all.  The pizza itself didn't taste bad, but the steak was a bit tough and chewy.  A few of my co-workers shared a large deep-dish pizza and they seemed to like it.  The food took a while in coming out, though, and our waiter actually came and apologized for the delay.  Our waiter also sung happy birthday to me and brought out a mini pizookie (cookie topped with ice cream), which was nice.

I didn't feel welcome and maybe it was the fact that our server was more focused on bigger parties to get the biggest tip possible. It would be nice to get good service by trying to make your customer feel welcomed and perhaps she will get more tips. I still tipped her but not because of the service I was given.  Next time If I get poor service then no tip will given.  So far, my day hasn't been going so well specially after the service I have received from Brianna or brittany (I can't really remember her name.) My sister ordered the Brewhouse burger and I did as well; unfortunaly both were lacking flavor and the meat tasted as if was just reheated in a microwave.  Im not sure if these patties are frozen but a whopper from Burger King has better quality ingredients.

The real problem occurred when our vegan friend ordered a veggie pizza with extra sauce to compensate for the lack of cheese. What he got was a pizza with absolutely no sauce.

Seriously,  the service here was a joke today. my co workers (8 people total) took me here for my birthday lunch, big mistake. We were seated immediately, out on the patio, where it took about 15 mins for our waiter to come and take our order. We ALL ordered off the so called  lunch menu, which took 45 mins before the first dish arrived. During this time we asked about 15 times for refils on our water (everyone ordered water to avoid confusing refil orders) but to no avail. About 10 mins after the last bit of food was consumed, a waitress poked her head out of the door 20 feet away and shouted ""you guys want water?"" Didnt even come to our table to ask. So damn lazy. We asked for the check, our waiter asked if we wanted single checks for everyone, we said whatever was fastest we would take, he bragged about how smart he was by putting numbers next to our orders so he could split the check super quickly, we said ok to that. He left and never came back. 20 mins of waiting for the check we finally flagged down the manager, told her what was happening and how bad our experience had been, and she half heartedly apologized and said she was gonna give us some gift certificates for free meals in the future. She came back 5 mins later and told us she didnt have a gift certificates but would make take one dish off our total bill. Wtf. Seriously?  She clearly doesn't know what customer service is, nor does she care about getting return service.

Everything was great here besides the service; however, the manager sees this and is genuinely working on improving this, at least I hope. Our server was initially good: she took our order, got us our drinks, and continued to refill our drinks. Nonetheless, as time progressed her enthusiasm dwindled. After we got our pizzas she basically disappeared - at times she walked by us and completely ignored us. This was a bit saddening, as we couldn't fully enjoy our pizza without the parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, ranch, or refills. Granted, this might sound like we were overreacting, but if you're going to pay $24 per pizza, you want to be able to enjoy it to the max. Furthermore, I tried giving our waitress the benefit of the doubt, but there was a family right next to us who was getting quality service and all her attention,  so we couldn't understand why we were being ignored. Finally, my friend got up and went and talked with the manager. We got a new waitress almost immediately and everything was set right: cheese, pepper, ranch, and refills all came speedily. This would have been enough to satisfy us. The big surprise came when we got the bill. The manager essentially discounted our appetizers ($17 value).  We appreciated this kind gesture because it displayed effort on the managers part.  I'm giving a 3 star because the original waitress was horrible and it affected our entire experience.

Normally when I go to restaurants, servers come over to greet and ask for our drinks within 3-5 minutes, maybe less than that, but our server took about 20 minutes. I had to walk to the front desk to remind them that we've been waiting for someone to take our order. Finally, we had a server. Yay! We're finally going to get our drinks and food. When we got our food, another server brought it to us but immediately walked away without giving us napkins and utensils.

As if that weren't enough, he then kicked a record distance field-goal that won the Superbowl for both the Broncos AND the Seahawks AT THE SAME TIME!

So impressive in fact, that I now declare it the 8th AND 9th wonder of the world. Bottom line: if Kevin puts a steaming turd-on-a-plate in front of you, his powers of pursuasion are such that you WILL be convinced that it is filet mignon, and you WILL take it and say thank you. Kevin should rule over all of us in magnanimous glory for all time. ALL HAIL KEVIN THE PROFESSIONAL!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=820
Wade M.,"Orange, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/23/2015,"My daughter came home for a week from college in Boston. On the day she arrived home she wanted to do family dinner at BJ's with her grandma and myself.  We were seated and our server, Patrick, introduced himself and took our order. The food was good, the environment was clean, and it was an overall good experience... except for Patrick.  I have been to restaurants around the world, and I can honestly say that Patrick was by far the greatest example of customer service that I have experienced. He related well with each of us, great sense of humor, and went above and beyond to make sure we had an awesome experience. I was so impressed by the service received that, upon leaving the restaurant, I stopped and asked to speak with the manager. So often managers hear all the complaints that I felt it so very important to let him know of what incredible service that Patrick had provided. It was a special evening for our family and Patrick made it even better - thank you Patrick !!  We will most definitely be requesting you the next time we visit BJ's in Orange!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=820
Lauren H.,"Orange, CA",103,19,6,1.0,9/26/2013,"This place is a disaster. First off let me say I have worked in the restaurant industry for a good while now. I actually was an ex bjs employee. And I love the policies of how to expedite amazing customer service to the paying guest at the restaurants. But let me say this place is a disgrace to the bjs  corporation. The servers are absolutely rude, and do not know how treat their own customers who are tipping them. Not just that, the manager was rude as well. My friend from out of state, she had ordered a drink. Mind you she is 23 years old. The server took the ID and the manager came over Did not say hello and say what was the problem, and began to interrogate her. Then Gave it back and left. The food and drinks too forever and was tasteless. Though the hostess and host were sweet. There were so many things done wrong that I would write an essay to explain everything.

This place is poorly managed and not logistically equipped for high-volume customers, they quickly become overwhelmed. Last time, on a quick lunch break, we placed out order 4 minutes after being seated. After 45 minutes, still no food. Our food came out after 50+ minutes, so we tracked down the manager and he told us our food came out 13 minutes after the server turned in the order. We told him we placed our order 50 minutes prior, but we were more or less dismissed without even an apology or discount. We didn't have time to eat, had to take it to-go, and went right back to work without eating lunch. This happened just like that 3 Fridays in a row.

Finding convenient parking was easy, getting seated was quick,  but waiting for our server took forever. After taking so long to take our order,  Natasha (I believe that was her name) continued to neglect our table. We had to ask for tobasco sauce 3 times, for napkins 3 times, and for our bill twice. That's right. We had to ask for utensils which didn't even come out until I was finishing up my last bite along with the tobasco sauce. And to make it worse, my hot chocolate came with hardly any chocolate; just chocolate flavored water. When I finally did get her attention, she offered to bring me another pack of chocolate so I can mix it myself?  No thanks. That's just awful. Also my boyfriend's peach berry iced tea had warm syrup still at the bottom. Gross. The next one they brought out had the same problem and for some reason they brought out two. Whatever we didn't even touch it after he tried the second one. Needless to say she only got a 15% tip. All in all 3 stars because the whole experience wasn't all that bad. Very clean and beautiful patio out back. Heaters made the night very nice to dine outside. I do want to come back to try their new s' mores pizookie though.

Then the manager told me that there is a 2 hour time limit for our table (really? a time limit? wth!)at the 1:45 mark the manager tells us that the happy hour applies to our table also unfortunately that was 15 min before it was over and our party was walking back and forth from the bar.  at 2 hours we're still ordering food and drink and he said our 2 hours was up and there was a party of 20 waiting (oh they take reservations? they don't) the party of 20 was sat next to us and we remained. i eventually left and some of our party remained the food was good, our server was awesome! the manager had the worst customer service i have seen in a long time!! i will not be back to this location. they are not large party friendly. all members of the party work within walking distance of this place and all were upset at the managers lack of customer service.

I continue to give them another chance hoping things would change for the better but tonight was the final straw. My friends and I came after work at around 8:15. When we got there the rude hostess told us it would be about a 25 minute wait. Fine for a Saturday night. Once we were seated our waiter came right away to take drink orders which looking back on the evening was a miracle. He came back with the drinks and I asked him if I could get a water to go with my cocktail. That never came and I had to ask someone else that I saw 30 minutes later to bring it to me. Long story short we had to get the waiters attention for everything and he never once came to our table to check on us. Our plates sat at our table for a good 45 minutes after we were finished eating and we actually had to ask another server to take care of our bill because our waiter was nowhere to be found. Two and a half hours of terrible service and I am never coming back to this BJ's again!

When we arrived, the hostess said it'd be 45 minutes for a booth (which was fine with us) when we went in to check she said we were next up as soon as a booth was available, WRONG! after three booths were given to other parties OF THREE! I asked the hostess why we didnt get the booth and she said ""because your party is too big for a booth!!!!) What the F...?! THEN WHY WERE WE WAITING FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF!!? thats when my head almost exploded and I spoke with Kevin (floor manager) who told me IT WASNT HIS PROBLEM!! After I explained why I was upset, he say's ""I'm sorry it's game night and we will get you seated as soon as possible, it's not my problem"" like he didn't even hear what I had just finished telling him.

Food & drinks were delicious Employees were very nice I have never been to a restaurant where so many waiters made the effort to check in on us to see if we were doing okay even if they were NOT waiting on our table. They also had a good sense of humor! When a waiter would be cleaning off the table next to us, they would casually check in with us and were friendly. Instead of just clearing off the table and getting on with the next thing on their list, they would make an effort to amuse us. One waiter accidentally knocked over some drinks on the table he was cleaning next to us and he apologized even though we did not get splashed a bit! Instead, he started making jokes with us about how much worse it could have been.

Not a big deal, we waited. 45 minutes later someone who walked in got seated right away! So I asked how much longer since it was now double the time we were told and one of the hostess tells me ""oh sorry we had a big party so we are giving the kitchen a chance to catch up before seating people again in another 30 minutes.""  Once again, not a big deal, things happen. The big deal is instead of the 3 hostess' standing around talking for an hour they could have let everyone know it would be a longer wait. FINALLY as I was walking out I got a text my table was ready.. And it only got worse. We waited 10 minutes for a server to come by. Then another 15 minutes to even get our drinks (not even alcoholic so no reason for the long wait).  By the attitude of our waiter, Tony,  he was obviously having a bad night and was walking around socializing.

So I asked the waiter to take it back. When my sandwich came back, it had no avocado. So they took it back again. By this time I was just annoyed and lost my appetite.

We then watched as all the parties before us and even parties after us got their tables. You'd think that would be because we had requested a table outside but we sat there for about 20 mins watching about three tables outdoors sit empty with dirty dishes on them as all the employees just walked by them and completely disregarded clearing them off. I also saw an employee walking around on her phone carrying a rag. And to make matters worse all the employees were gathered inside talking and laughing. Then when we finally got our table and ordered our food, my husbands salad came early and was only the size of a side salad. I would expect a Cesar salad to be much larger for the price.

The waiter was no where to be seen and when he finally approached our table he said that everything was ready with the exception of the mahi mahi tacos, he said that was holding up the order...really!!? fish takes 45 minutes to cook? and it's just two tacos!? since that was actually my order, I tried to keep calm and nicely told the waiter to go ahead and bring out the rest of food so that my co-workers could start eating, he said ""Sure, It will be right out in two minutes!"" then suddenly again we were waiting, waiting and waiting....after 20 minutes (by the way our lunch hour was already up), he brings out the food and turns out my tacos were made but there was a flatbread that was forgotten for another co-worker!!! The manager came and apologized and what not and the flatbread was not charged but the service was just beyond ridiculous! by the time we got our food it was cold and we had to eat in a rush. I understand that the restaurant is new and I am sure things are getting settled but don't lie about what's holding up the food and at least bring out chips and salsa while you have your guests waiting for an hour to get their food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=800

Lorie S.,"La Habra, CA",36,10,,1.0,7/25/2014,"Like a lot of these reviews our experience was bad. My daughter was in town and wanted to go to one of her favorite places and she was really excited which quickly burst her bubble. We ordered drinks which took awhile, then ordered an appetizer which too awhile and ordered lunch. I ordered a kids cheese pizza (as I can't eat a lot of food at one time since I had a surgery and also I am a senior). I ate my daughters salad which was the wedge and I have never had a wedge salad with the core in it so they brought me another one which looked all torn apart. Then the lunches came and my daughters BBQ chicken pizza came with tomatoes which she ordered without so that had to go back. She got her pizza when all the rest of us were done with our lunch. Then we get our bill and I was charged for a regular pizza and there was another issue with the bill so we asked to speak to the manager. My daughter started to explain to him the problems with the bill starting with my pizza and his comment was ""she isn't a child"". If they don't allow seniors or anyone other than kids to order off the kids menu they should have said that when we ordered. He totally had an attitude and took the bill and made the adjustment. Then to go in the restroom and it was a mess. I would not go back to this location again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=800

This is not the first time they don't get my order correct so I decided to speak to the lady that brought out my order and explained to her that I asked for a veggie patty she then told me no see on the receipt it says hamburger no veggie patty... how is she going to tell me that the receipt is correct and i am not. I told her I understand that's what the receipt says but I asked for a veggie patty and they must of took it down wrong or forgot. She then goes to speak to the manager and my friends and i hear the manager say ""What the fuck she didn't say that"" how unprofessional is that to curse in front of a customer!! I was now really angry and they told me they could give me the burger for free but to change it to a veggie patty would take up to 20 min. I no longer wanted them to help me with anything after how horribly I was treated.

Sara B.,"Tustin, CA",203,125,,4.0,9/10/2014,I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed BJs as much as I did at this location! BJs is usually ok but I really enjoyed the service at this location and had the joy of not being frustrated by lack of parking which is almost always what happens when I head out to the Block for dinner! Peter was our server and he was very understanding when I said I had friends coming but they'd be a bit. The hostesses were also very helpful in making sure our visit with a very young baby was given consideration. We started with the chicken lettuce wraps and they were very good! The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the lettuce was all fresh and crisp. The sauces combined were excellent on the wraps! I had the mahi mahi tacos and they were ok. Fish was cooked well but the tortillas were really dry. One friend had the chipotle salmon and she really enjoyed it. She said it had more heat than she had planned but she still liked it. My other friend had the hawaiian mahi mahi and she also enjoyed her dish. Enough so that she ate much more than she normally does. We finished with the peanut butter smores pizookie. It was tasty but so sweet that we each only had a few bites and then we couldn't eat any more because it was too sweet. BTW we usually get the bacon chicken ranch pizza and always have enjoyed it. We ventured out of our comfort zone and we were pleasantly surprised!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=780

Stephanie S.,"Anaheim, CA",3,7,5,1.0,12/28/2013,"My boyfriend have been to this BJ's a few times since it is a little closer to us. We usually sit at the bar and have no problem with service we receive from the bartenders. The day after Christmas my boyfriend and I decided to meet my family here for lunch. I gave the hostess my name and told her I needed a table for 5. She said it will be about 20 minutes. She didn't give me a pager or tell me that she will be calling my name. Before I could tell her that we will be waiting at the bar, she already acknowledged the people waiting behind me so I justed moved to the side. I figured my boyfriend and I could wait at the corner of the bar next right next to the entrance so we could see and hear them call my name while we wait for the rest of my party to get there. As we sip on our beer at the bar about 10 minutes in, I see the hostess taking people to their tables and these people came in way after us, then 5 more minutes pass by and they are seating people as they walk in.  Then my family arrives and I see a hostess with a few menus walking around asking 2 different parties their names. I assume she is looking for me. So I approach her and ask her if she is looking for Stephanie. She replies ""Uh...no"" as she passes right by me. I thought her response was a bit rude. So I approach the hostess who initially took my name and asked how much longer it would take to seat my party. She then looks one of the hostess and says ""Oh here's Stephanie!"" I looked at both hostess and told them that I have been waiting at the bar and no one has called my name. One of the hostess replied ""We called your name twice"" and I told her that she didn't because I have been staring at them the whole time from the bar which was only a few feet away, and I didn't see one hostess go outside or walk around the front calling my name, but only one time and the hostess who was doing that wasn't even looking for me.  I give this BJ's 1 star because something so simple in reference to find where the party is located after putting their name in and even telling the party to wait close by the hostess booth because they will be calling my name shortly would have been nice. Oh, and the rude hostess who brushed me off needs to learn customer service and instead of replying to me with a ""Uh...no"" she could've said ""I'm sorry I'm looking for another party but what is your name and I can let you know how much longer your wait will be.  I don't recommend this BJ's for dining in and dealing with the lazy and unprofessional hostesses. I'm going to continue eating and drinking at the bar were the bartenders know how to be professional and serve you. If I do decide to dine in at a BJ's I'll be going to Brea or Cerritos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=780

Geoff H.,"Anaheim, CA",29,8,,1.0,1/2/2015,"Just a plain and frustrating experience- the service was pretty bad and food was nothing special. Waited over 30 minutes for a table (when there were available tables open). The sever took over 10 minutes to come by and offer drinks and waited 10 more minutes to receive them. We asked for some kids menus and the staff didn't bring them, we had to walk up to the hostess desk and get them ourselves- while the manager with their headset on ignored us...the food took 25 minutes to arrive and it was just so-so in quality, missing some condiments, such as BBQ sauce- so we had to ask for it and wait 5 more minutes while the food got cold...the management didn't come around to the tables at all. It seemed that the staff was inexperienced, understaffed and didn't really care about the customer experience or food. Mostly seems to cater to people drinking.

Crystal P.,"Orange, CA",17,28,45,1.0,3/6/2014,"Came here tonight for a friend's birthday. There were about 14 of us. The service was pretty bad. The waitress looked very annoyed with answering any questions we had.  I'm pretty sure she was new.  We waited for about an hour to get seated, another hour to get our food and another hour to figure out how to pay.  My boyfriend also asked for some hot sauce and ranch and by the time they brought it to him, he was pretty much done with the food.  The waitress didn't really bother to bring us refills either.  My friends had to ask for refills and had to wait at least 20 minutes for them.  She never asked me if I wanted another refill, so I was just over it and didn't want to wait any longer.  We each wanted to pay for our own orders separately and most of us had our debit cards.  When we told the waitress, she said we could only split the check 2 ways.  After my boyfriend argued with the manager, he let us split it 3 ways. It was all just a huge mess.  They made it more complicated than it should have been.  How can you not do split checks??  This waitress didn't know what she was doing.  We each had to figure out how we were gonna pay it all in 3 checks and after we paid, the waitress comes over and tells us we still owe money.  I looked over the receipt thinking how that was possible and they had over charged us.  She finally fixed it and then came back saying we needed to pay the tax still.  By this point we were all beyond ready to leave.  None of us even felt like leaving a tip, since the service was so bad.  We all left one anyways.  After what seemed like forever, we finally got it all taken care of and left.  I don't think I'll ever be returning.  The pizza is expensive and tastes pretty mediocre.  It's really nothing special.  As for the service, this is the 2nd time I go to a BJ's (last time was the one on Jamboree) and the service has never really been good.  I understand this is a pretty new location, but they have A LOT to work on.  We were all so frustrated.  I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=780

Nothing great.  It's like the oil temperature wasn't high enough because the fried calamari wasn't very crispy and it did lack a lot of flavor.   It took 45 minutes from the time we were seated til our dinner came out.  The food was decent but the service was just horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=780

I love spicy and my waitress added more Cajun spices for me. There was no kick in the beginning, but the spiciness builds up as you eat. Service is somewhat slow, my friend waited half an hour to get a refill on her water. Oreo pizooki was okay, too sweet for my taste, I prefer normal chocolate chip pizooki.

Lillie K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,4,5.0,8/3/2013,Love this restaurant soooo much! I don't think I can say one thing bad about it :) there was a little bit of a wait but everyone was served a delicious pizza and waiters going around asking if we want drinks (free refills)! The menu was huge with so many options for every taste bud!! Service was fast and the staff was incredible but not pushy like annoying! You felt like they were there to serve you and not to mention there were some super cute waiters!! I had the fettuccini Alfredo which was the best I'd ever had! I'd totally recommend BJ's hands down!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=740

We had Allyssa T. for our waitress and she was great. She checked on us frequently made sure we were ok, had everything we needed and recommended a couple drinks that were right on target with what we wanted.  Service was great and the food was good also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=740
Sherry T.,"Signal Hill, CA",51,74,5,2.0,7/17/2014,"I generally like BJ's for their food and beer selection but I've not been a fan of the service at this location. The restaurant itself is in a great place and very clean. Went for lunch at 2pm 7/16. It wasn't crowded so I figured service should be good. Not so much. Our server was slow and inattentive. We had to stop her everytime we needed a refill or something. And she'd acknowledge with a look of annoyance.  She didn't come by to check on us even though it was a slow time. My friend got double fries but his entree came out with a teeny tiny portion. Another server said, ""oh there's a fresh batch that will be right out"". yeah so as we are all almost done eating, still no fries. We asked someone in a shirt/tie (assuming a manager?) who went to check. He came back shortly after and put them on the table almost as if we inconvienanced him. Not a ""hey sorry for the wait"", ""enjoy your meal"" ""can I get you anything else?"" I probably visit this location 1-2 month as I work nearby. I feel as if the staff have not all been trained very well on customer service skills. They seem indifferent and not particularly happy to be there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=840
Rosie G.,"Corona, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/16/2013,"I personally haven't been to a BJ's in years... This place/location actually reminded me why. It's Friday, in the middle of the day and its just me and my boyfriend.  We were seated quickly but didn't see our actual waiter until  like 10-15 later. She took our drink order and didn't receive them until like 15 minutes later. Frustrating because she didn't even bring us water and it was pretty warm outside. She walked out to the patio several times approaching other tables and completely not even looking the other way to see if we needed anything. I had to ask another waiter for service. She looked miserable as if she was having a bad day. Personally some people should really not be waiters if they are incompetent  of smiling and having communication skills. I didn't get the waitress name but only because she didn't give it to me when she approached us lol screw this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=840

The food is the same as all its other chain counterparts.  What I'm rating on is the service.  Came here with my family (party of four) on a Sunday night.  The wait was fine, only about 15 minutes. But our server was not very pleasant.  She didn't really smile and wasn't really helpful. She was also really bad at refilling our drinks.  She didn't ever come check up on us and we had to flag her down for refills.  Then she would act like we were bothering her. It took a loooong time for us to get our pizzas and when we did, they were COLD! We were all hungry so we just ate them cuz who knows how long it'll be before we got another one.

Richard And Elainne S.,"Garden Grove, CA",11,132,39,4.0,5/11/2014,Late night snack with the bestie. This was our first time at this location and its pretty nice. We sat at the bar since there were open tables. Our waiter (forgot his name) was very nice and very attentive. He noticed we were chit chatting more than looking through the menu but didnt rush us to order. Thats a plus! And he kept checking up on us. We ordered the mozzarella salad and spinach dip. The food was good. Normal bjs food. Of course we had the pazookie. We ordered the mini but ended up with the regular size. But hey! Why complain. Its a pazookie. And of course it was delish. Food was like any other bjs location. Nothing special. But the service was great. Would come back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=680

Kendrick H.,"Orange, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/1/2013,"Probably the worst BJs I've ever gone to. Came here twice and each time walked out feeling super whatever. Service here blows, they ran out of their own beer, bartender gave the guy next to me 20 in ones because he was out of change. The waitress in the bar section gave us the wrong drinks. She also took the high top tables next to us and gave them to the guests next to us without asking if we needed them for anyone who might be joining us.  Honestly the rating at this place is well deserved and probably generous.

Ashlee And Nicholas F.,"Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",30,144,31,1.0,10/1/2013,"Reviewed by Nick- I don't often find the need to vent on Yelp, in fact, I often choose to let myself cool off before writing any negative reviews. That being said, I'm writing this a week after my visit on Wed (9/25/13) at about 5:30pm. The place was pretty full, but by no means packed, nor were the servers swamped.  We were sat at our table and it took a good 10 mins for our server (Lorenzo C #363) to even stop by our table to introduce himself. Yeah... I'm calling out names! We asked for some water to start with (and a beer for me), and asked for a Gluten free menu for my wife. Another 10min later, Lorenzo drops of the menu and disappears for another 10min. He finally comes back with the water, only to quickly leave again...  the beer follows shortly. This is about 30min after being seated and we only have water. Keep in mind we are sitting there, menus closed waiting to order, and Lorenzo is nowhere to be found. At this point, I'm really getting pissed about the lack of service, so start keeping my eye on our waiter as he travels about the restaurant, talking with fellow servers and having a blast! At one point, we make eye contact and he's walking straight towards me. I'm thinking, ""Wow... we might actually get to order!"" But no, he literally takes a 90 degree turn and goes out to the patio. It was almost comical... I got his attention after he returned from the patio (and ordered) and was watching him the entire time we were waiting for our food. It seems like the staff here is straight from the movie ""Waiting."" Young people, ungrateful for a job, talking, gossiping, and fraternizing with the other servers rather than tending to customers. When the food arrived, it was dropped off by another member of the staff and we were offered no condiments or even brought out any place settings. When Lorenzo came by again, I had to actually lean back into the isle and block him to get some ketchup. I was never offered a refill on my water or even asked if I wanted another beer (rare). To add insult to injury, my wife ordered a wedge salad with Italian and Lorenzo brought us one with blue cheese (looks the same I know). We were eating out with our 15-month daughter, so we had a narrow window to eat before bedtime. Needless to say, by this time she was getting cranky, and rather than wait for Lorenzo to bring another salad, my wife ate what was brought to her. Next time Lorenzo came by, I brought up the fact that the salad was wrong, and it seemed like he could care less. Didn't offer to take a side salad off the bill ($2.99) or comp a beer... nothing. I had to ask for more water when I requested the bill, paid promptly and left this pit of misery.  My bill said 7:22pm on it, so we were there for almost 2 entire hours.  Food gets a 3- Average chain brew house food, but the service gets a 1. Terrible waiters more concerned with catching up with friends, than serving guests. It wasn't just Lorenzo, I noticed all the waiters back by the patio exit grouping up, talking together and generally ignoring guests on several occasions.  I REALLY hope the management re-evaluates the waiters they hired at this place. I know several, personable people that would LOVE a job at BJ's were they can earn good tips. Sadly, the crew here seems like they have better things to do than serve paying customers. The management should take this behavior as a sign as just that... these people DO NOT CARE about serving customers, so please do them a favor and fire them!  I was actually going to wait to speak with a manager before we left as the level of service left me speechless, but again, we had a cranky baby and had to leave quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=680

Diana N.,"Westminster, CA",178,150,13,1.0,4/19/2015,"this location is alot nicer and bigger than the one in HB and alot worse. it was just me and my boyfriend and we came during late night happy hour. we asked to get seated at the bar area for a reason (again, happy hour) but apparently our server didn't get the memo.  we ordered off some appetizers off the happy hour menu which was the avocado egg rolls and buffalo wings. and also the hawaiian deep dish pizza which was dry as hell and the meditteranean chicken pita wrap. the wrap was the worst wrap i ever put in my mouth.  it was missing all the feta toppings and it was so gross i had to send that back. i rather have mcdonalds snack wrap, thank you very much.  anyways our bill came out to be $50. ok thats alot considering if i planned on coming here to spend half of that. i thought our server made a minor mistake of forgetting to charge us happy hour price but she says ""oh you guys ordered a full order of the avocado egg rolls and buffalo wings.."" Me and my bf looked at each other and was like what? lol why would you give us a full order of these items when we clearly ordered from the happy hour menu AND we didnt even finish it! not even close! its between two people and youre going to assume we were asking for a full order??? on top of that, service was painfully slow and terrible. i think i waited 30+ minutes. never coming back here ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orange-2?start=680

I ask if they can put it on the TV in front of our table. They said sure, about 10 minutes later i ask again. 5 minutes later they come back and tell me the manager said they don't get that channel. The Raider Game is on channel 5 I've told them both times when i asked them. So it's been about 17 minutes now and i still don't have my pitcher of beer. I tell the server we are leaving Since They don't get channel 5 and i still don't have my drinks. They some how Figure out how to get channel 5. So we end up staying, and for 5 minutes they play the game on the tv in front of us. Then they Change the channel to Golf and tell me some one requested it. They put the game on a tv all the way to the rIght where it's hard to see. I got to tell you, this it's not the place you want to go to to watch the Raider game while you are enjoying beer and pizza.
