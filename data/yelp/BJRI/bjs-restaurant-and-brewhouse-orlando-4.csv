Shawn B.,"Austin, TX",116,2,,1.0,6/17/2017,The hostess moved us after being seated because she only had 1 server for that area.  We moved and waited over 15 minutes and still did not get any service.  Once we did did someone to help us out desserts came out about 15 minutes apart.  Who likes to eat alone?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=40

Jose D.,"Cicero, IL",4,12,37,5.0,11/5/2016,If your a beer lover this is your new favorite spot. They have their own take on your typical beer with a kick love the stout has a hell of a kick and has a great malty taste and the avocado egg rolls are amazing. I am a man that loves burgers and an ice cold beer and this place has some of the best burgers around perfectly cooked to your taste.

Tatyana S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",6,3,2,1.0,1/28/2017,"My husband and I were trying to place an order for pick up tonight. After calling 3 times and nobody picked up the phone, on the fourth time someone did. He said he wanted to place the order and the hostesses put him on hold for s while. Then she picked up the phone again he my husband said the same thing, and she put him on hold again. By the 3rd time, and 20 minutes later, the same person said that the one responsible for the take outs was busy and she would transfer him as soon as she was available. Really?! After 20 min?!

I'm not a salt user and I had to use salt and pepper. Having a Bazookie. So excited to try. 4 stars are due to my love for BJ's Brewhouse and the fact that Kelsey was great.

Food options are plentiful! Can find something great for just about any taste you might have. Our group ordered a variety of items and all of them were well presented and tasty.

AJ K.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,3.0,10/4/2016,"Never been a big fan of this in the past, but I've given the newest Orlando one a try.  Had the Oktoberfest seasonal draft as my drink of choice. Was pretty middle of the road for that style. For starters, I had the chips and salsa. The chips were well salted and not overly greasy. The salsa was on the sweeter side, but still very delectable. And you can never beat unlimited refills :) I chose the fire roasted barbacoa seasoned chicken which exceeded my expectations. It was light and juicy and the spice was quite subtle (I don't do spice well.) It was served over a bed of brown rice and black beans, neither were particularly of note.  Overall, I was impressed by how this visit compared to previous ones. It was a good average american place to grab a bite amongst the wasteland of I-Drive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=40
Cipriano M.,"Orlando, FL",193,680,4149,1.0,4/23/2016,"As a fan of BJ's Restaurant, I love their menu and know we will be provided with excellent service. So I thought during this visit. My friends and I ate here for dinner before doing an escape room. It was early evening, so there was no one in the restaurant basically. We were sat in a timely manner and everything went smooth here. We looked over the menus and was trying to decide on what we wanted.  Time goes by and no service yet. We thought it was ok for now because we could look over the menu for more time. Well about  minutes later, the server finally comes by for our drink order. We sat long enough and ordered our meals as well. We were thirsty, so we needed refills, Well that took a long time as well. The food finally arrived and I was not impressed at with the appearance of my dish. I ordered the deep dish ravioli. It looked as if it was dried out in that sauce with melted cheese on top. For $18, it was not good at all. I should have ordered the chicken dinner with veggies at a cheaper price. The flavor was lacking and it was more sauce then pasta.  Thankfully we didn't order desert because I was just disappointed with this BJ's. Reading the other Yelp reviews on this restaurant location reflects my negative visit as well. Slow service and awful food taste here. This was one of the waste BJ's yet in my book.  I would not recommend dining here because other Yelpers are having issues here and it seems this location needs improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=40

Raquel C.,"Orlando, FL",19,15,70,1.0,2/19/2016,"Worst experience I've been through at any restautant. I have been to 4 different BJ'S and they were good but here... the wait, the service, and the food were bad.  We were a group of 6 and we were there celebrating a birthday. It was a saturday night and yes it was busy but not that much for the kind of service we got. I have too many things(bad) to say about this visit to this BJ'S so I'm going to number them: 1. The wait: we were told there was a 45 min wait to get a table and we're seated an hour and a half later. The wait to get our food was 45 minutes. 2. The service: First let's talk about the drinks. When the drinks got there, the waitress spilled my friend's water, on him (an accident can happen to anyone, but fix it). She said someone would come to clean up the spilled water... no one ever showed up and we ate with a puddle at our feet. The waitress never brought back the water she spilled, my friend had to get up and go to the bar to get a water. She took forever to refill the rest of the drinks, two of my friends had to stop eating at one point to wait for their soda refills. The rest of the service was bad, friend 2 never got a silverware and napkin. Friend 3 and 4 ordered pizza and they got their food 20 minutes after everyone else. Friend 3 never got a plate even though we asked for it, so friend 4 had to share her plate. 3. The food: Now the food, it could have been so much better, like in other BJ's. I had a burger that I ordered medium, it was burnt. Friend 1 had a baked pasta, the picture on the menu looked nothing like what he got. The dish was not even filled half way and it was mostly cheese. Friend 2 ordered a medium well burger and got it raw.  At the end of the night the waitress messed up the receipts twice so she ended up giving me a burger I had ordered to go for free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=40
Adrie D.,"Orlando, FL",58,135,333,5.0,7/26/2016,"BJ's food is pretty standard and this location is what you would expect from any other BJ's: extensive menu, great food quality, reasonable prices, ...BUT what really had me impressed was the customer service!!! I try not to review big restaurant chains just because there's not much you can say if the restaurant in California would be the exact same thing in Florida... and I'm talking about Cheesecake Factory, TGI Fridays, Olive Garden... etc.  That being said, I really have to give the management team big kuddos because they're doing something right!!! We got here as a party of 6, but right when we got there they were seating a BIG party, I would say probably 20ppl, and the hostess was trying to accommodate us but she knew the servers were busy at the moment; nevertheless, you could see her trying hard to get us seated, so much that when she did the server wasn't totally ready for us but we tried to be as easy of a table as possible for her. Let me go back a little, just to tell you that we parked in the back of the restaurant and I was in crutches dragging myself behind my family, when we were passing the outside patio an employee saw me and opened the back door for me, so that I didn't have to go around to the main entrance.  When our table was ready a young guy was taking us to our big booth when another customer passed by me like in a rush while I could barely walk and the employee actually stood up for me and told him he was trying to take me to the table. I TRULY FELT TAKEN CARE OF, and this is not a standard procedure from any restaurant, that was truly passion for the industry and place of work...that's why I believe management's doing a great job! Our server was on point, accurate, and kind. We tried to make her job as easy as possible and she took great care of us even while she was busy.

Danny B.,"Redwood City, CA",2,27,6,3.0,3/22/2016,"As an avid BJ customer in California I was excited to have a familiar restaurant choice while on vacation. I was sorely disappointed! My jambalaya, which is a favorite of mine, was served with non sautéed vegetables & soupy rice. Two other people at our table had salads with poor lettuce quality.  We had to wait 15 minutes at our table before water was even served.  Our meals came out staggered by several minutes.  And at our table we had a meal served on a cracked plate. Repeatedly there were common food service industry standards that happened. It was not a great representation of the chain. David the manager was very respectful of our experience & offered to help make the bill reflect that.  Really hope it's just one night off for this establishment & isn't habitual.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=40
Matthew H.,"Altamonte Springs, Orlando, FL",66,122,286,2.0,1/13/2017,"I'd say 2 stars is a generous review. My wife and I went in for lunch during a relatively slow time. All seemed we as we were quickly seated by the host.  The waiter stopped by and asked if I had the rewards app and I stated I didn't but please wait to explain it until my wife was back from the restroom. He insisted on explaining it anyway and left the table. He eventually came back with waters and never explained it again once my wife was seated.  He asked if we had questions but didn't seem to know any of the answers. He was confused on the daily rib special and even the fact that they offered a kale salad. Very uneducated on the menu basics.  We placed our order and i asked to have my drink now my wife wanted to wait. He decided to hold both drinks for about 20 mins until the food arrived. Only thing was we had to ask 2 additional times for him to bring us our drinks.  My wife had a small wedge salad appetizer and when she finished she put the plate on the edge of the table. After 4 visits and asking multiple times to take the plate he never did. I had to almost literally open his hand and place the plate in it for him to take it.  On top of everything when we tried to ask a question he would start walking away and didn't really listen to us.   To cap it all off when I went to provide my rewards number he took the phone and disappeared for about 10 mins. Not sure why he couldn't use his pen and note pad to copy the number but it seemed kind of silly to take the phone for so long.      Over all it was a disappointing visit, and I don't remember the food to much because the service was so bad I just wanted to leave",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=20
Andrea S.,"Houston, TX",127,6,13,1.0,1/28/2017,"The experience at this restaurant truly doesn't deserve the 1 star I am required to give. I had come here with a group of 7. We are visiting Orlando for the Pro Bowl and we're happy to come here because it was something new. I truly didn't expect to be treated the way that we were.  So I had a simple order of Atlantic Salmon with Double Broccoli, simple right?! Apparently not. My order arrived with the salmon with rice and  mixed vegetables. I advised that this was incorrect. The 2nd time around all they did was slap broccoli on top of the original order. The 3rd time around they partially removed the mixed vegetables and slapped the original salmon on the plate omitting the sauce.  At this point I take my plate and find a manager. I explain the situation and I get barely an apology. My good comes out and IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SAUCE.  I have an issue with the fact that the manager did not touch the table to make sure that my order was correct. The service was very poor and I did not feel as though they cared enough.  To top it off, we ordered 2 pizzokie's and needed additional spoons. We asked the guy who dropped off the desserts. Nothing. We asked our waiter for spoons. Nothing. We finally flagged down a random waiter and she brings the spoons extremely fast. So fast in fact that a couple of us literally said ""oh WOW"".  It's disappointing to come from out of town to leave within a visit sick as this. I hope that the staff reads this and does better.

We tried several appetizers, my only criticism would be that the calamari was unseasoned, like not just under, but nonexistent. The root beer ribs were phenomenal, we had order them like an app. For dinner my entree was the jambalaya and hit the spot. Was very well seasoned and the heat built up throughout the portion in a good way. The shrimp was perfectly prepared and chicken stayed tender. I was stuffed but was able to try a small taste of one of those cookie ice cream plates. Superb! Soft chewy cookie and great balance of sweetness.

This last time I ordered chicken tenders for my son and avocado rolls for me which is an appetizer btw. It took so long that even the people seating right behind us got the order which btw was a full meal and we didn't (about 25 mts)  The bottom line is if you want to feel like someone is doing you a favor while you spend your money please go to this place.

Got a club soda but no refill ask... they do not have the timing of follow-through down. Was an off hour (4pm on a Sunday) so could be shift change doldrums...

We took a large (16 people) group here after playing the Escape game nearby, and our servers did an amazing job of dealing with so many people. I really liked the queso dip appetizer, which was more about chili than cheese. The appetizer combo was less exciting, and I particularly disliked the egg rolls and the spinach dip. My entree, the ahi tuna salad, was delicious, with tender, rare slices of ahi arranged around a nicely tossed pile of greens with just the right amount of tangy dressing, and a nice variety of textures.

I ordered a Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon that was absolutely delightful. My wife ordered the North Beach Mahi Mahi with couscous and shrimp, it too was delicious.

We ordered the spinach/artichoke dip and asked for some veggies instead of all chips. He went out of his way to get carrots and celery. He offered cucumbers from the bar but half of the ones he gave had tasted like they had been sitting out for awhile (warm and a tangy/sour). These might have been at the bottom of the storage container. Not good.  We then ordered a deep dish pizza and it took a LONG time to come out. After more than 30 min, the manager came out and dropped our pizza off saying ""we had them make you another because it wasn't up to our standard"". At this point it was around 11pm and we would have appreciated someone acknowledging that a pizza was being remade. We ordered the ""Favorite"" which is essentially the supreme.

Paul L.,"Longwood, FL",258,421,895,2.0,7/14/2016,"Friends of ours from out of town suggested meeting up with their kids at a BJs, which left me wondering why we'd be eating at the food-vending place of a wholesale club.  Call me cloistered, but there being no @BJsRestaurants and brewhouse around us, I hadn't heard of them.  So we didn't even check out the reviews on Yelp before hand.  But when we arrived ahead of them, and we were left to sit in the waiting area (it's their 'policy'), we had a chance to look in @Yelp. Uh-oh! I hate giving bad reviews, I really do.  If nothing else, it indicates I had a bad experience (duh!), and nobody likes THAT. But as sharp a pen/tongue as I possess, I enjoy giving compliments so much more. So I thought: may be the RECENT reviews were better?  No such luck - recent 4 months has a lower avg than any other 4-month period.  I mean, when the '1's outnumber the '5's, it tells you something. Still, I was determined not to be biased by that.  Each experience is different, right?   Alas - the slow forgetful service was evident right away.  We were a big table of 9 - hard to miss.  But it was not till at least 10 minutes after we were all seated that the waiter, with stuff in his hands, came to us and said, haven't forgotten about you - gonna put these down and come right over.  When another few minutes had passed, I looked for him, and observed him going to EVERY one of the other 4 or 5 tables he had, going to the kitchen, to the station etc., BEFORE he came back over (and not till after some unseemly arm-waving to get his attention).  The ladies tried a couple of sample beers, but he never bothered to come back to get the 'real' order until much later and after much pleading. When he brought the water, he was one short; without prompting, he said, ""I'll bring that other water after I take your order..."" and then, those famous 'last' words, ""I WON'T FORGET!""  I don't need to tell you what happened...   The spinach dip came with very few chips; not his fault, but since we couldn't get his attention, we ended up having to flag down another person to get more chips, brought only after the dip's gone cold.  No one came to ask how everything was after the entrees were brought, or else we would have informed him that one of the pizza orders was wrong: ""Pepperoni"", instead of ""cheese"".  Now to be fair, that is totally understandable since they sound so similar - I mean, you can say ""pepperoni"" before taking a picture, and it'll have the same effect!   Thankfully, the food was not all bad - having read that one review, and seen the picture, having no fried breaded rock posing as a french fry is always a blessing.  The mahi mahi shrimp dish and my wife's chicken spinach and quinoa dinner were by not out-of-this-world-write-home-NOW delicious, but they by themselves would have earned a 3-star rating. Not bad for value either - better value than the ""best beginnings"" app at $18.75 or the spin dip at (9.95).  Credit to the waiter for letting 'reminding' us there's a dupe, in that the spin dip is also in the best beginnings (which I knew).  The artichoke used in the spin dip was unusually fibrous, and the buffalo sauce with the chicken nuggets was arguably too salty, but those are minor flaws.  My friend's deep-dish pizza, though, was just between lukewarm and cold - only marginally better after we asked them to warm it up and it was brought back too soon.  As Christians, we had a nice chuckle amongst ourselves about how we don't care for Laodicean cuisine! They had me sign up for their rewards program while we were waiting.  I didn't bother pulling the card out when I paid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=20

Our visits between 6 and 9 or 10 are enjoyable, but if a group of us show up there after 10, the experience changes and food is usually not up to par maybe because there aren't enough cooks after a certain time.

My porter/cider fusion got all over our booth and my white shirt. The server came and cleaned it up (roughly) but we just moved ourselves to another booth.

Courtney M.,"Orlando, FL",9,24,10,1.0,6/17/2015,"Although I love BJs food and atmosphere, my boyrfriend and I had a horrible experience here recently and I thought I'd let ya'll know about it. Rather than recant everything, I'm just going to post the letter I sent in to BJs customer service.  ""Dear BJs, After a recent visit to your location in Orlando, Fl, I felt the need to give a little feedback and constructive criticism.  My boyfriend and I went for dinner around seven o'clock and the restaurant was packed! We were excited because obviously a packed restaurant means good food. When we approached the host stand we were informed that the wait was nearing an hour, but since we were already there it seemed a waste to leave and dine somewhere else. During our wait we sat at the bar and enjoyed three rounds of cocktails recommended by the bar tender, and they were delicious and refreshingly strong! After our wait we were seated and told a server would be with us soon. Normally I wouldn't mind waiting for our waitress to attend to our table (I also wait tables so I know how it can be when the restaurant is busy) but forty five minutes after we had been seated I decided to pop by the host stand to see if everything was okay. The host sincerely apologized and told me she'd find my server and send her our way. It was apparent that the server did not know we were seated or that we were her responsibility, but the miscommunication still occurred.  She happily took our order and brought our drinks super quick, and I was grateful that she put in the effort to make up for the wait. Our food was brought out not long after and although my boyfriend was happy with his meal, sadly I wasn't. I've been to BJs many times before (in the location in Palm Beach, my hometown) and without fail I always order kale and roasted Brussels sprouts salad. It is literally my favorite salad in the world, and when I don't have time to stop by my local BJs to pick one up I try to make it at home, but it's never as good. Our waitress asked if everything was okay with our food, and although I hate to be ""that customer,"" I asked if she could ask the kitchen what went wrong because the salad was missing the best part, the Brussels sprouts and blueberries! A quick trip to the kitchen and back confirmed that the kitchen was actually out of those items. Of course I was upset because my favorite salad wasn't complete without those ingredients, but I didn't mind reordering because I love all the food on the menu. However I was upset that I wasn't informed of the ingredient outage before I placed my order. Disappointed as I was I reordered and enjoyed my meal and date.  When the bill came and my boyfriend pulled out his wallet to pay I noticed that the charge for the salad was still on there. While only a minor mistake, no fault of our sweet waitress, it was slightly annoying that had I not noticed the charge I would have paid for a salad that I did not eat, no less enjoy. Also, it seemed odd that after many miscommunications within the restaurant that led to a poor experience for my boyfriend and I that the manager didn't make time to come by and apologize. It only takes a minute to stop by a customers table, but as a guest it means a lot for a manager to recognize and apologize for the restaurants mistakes. As much as I love the food (I mean really that salad is so good), I don't know how quick I would be to return to the BJs near me. It just seemed that our almost hundred dollar bill was not indicative of the service or food quality. Hopefully after receiving this letter some changes will be made and I can go back to BJs to enjoy my favorite salad and the amazing cocktails. Much love,  Courtney McGowan"" After sending this letter I received a phone call directly from the manager at this location, his name is Cedric, and I really appreciated that. He assured me that he would make up for this experience and even invited me back so we could be introduced. I was excited to go back and meet the manager, as well as have a do over for our meal. A few days later I got an email for a twenty dollar gift card to BJs. I've never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I was almost offended. Considering how much I spent on my last trip to BJs and how bad the evening turned out to be, I don't really think twenty dollars did much to make up for it, and if I truly wanted a redo of that night I would have to spend another eighty dollars. I'm sorry to say that I probably won't even be bothered to use the card because it would only cover one round of drinks and I'd still be left with the terrible service. My recommendation to all is to save your money because the service is almost guaranteed to be sub par, and being more concerned with money than customer satisfaction, BJs wont do much to make up for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=100

But not thin like New York Style. It's just right. I enjoyed my choice in gluten free crust and toppings as well. The other sizes are 6in. 9in. 12in. 15in. I believe the last two are correct.

The service was wonderful and the server and trainers were funny and engaging. And the food was great. Since then, I have gone there four other times. All I can say is, it's time for new management. Progressively, the quality has gone down. Everything from the salt and pepper shakers showing clear signs of never having been washed or changed out (the salt inside the salt shakers inside the restaurant was BROWN, to the ketchup showing clear signs of never having been wiped (we came in right at 11am and the ketchup bottle was caked with dried ketchup not once but twice when I was here for lunch), this restaurant shows very clearly that this BJ's has NO cleaning standards.  The service? Meh. It's a mixed bag. There are some great ones, but they are probably moving on to better restaurants by now. And all that is left are the crappy ones who just can't manage tables. The most recent time I was there, we waited 15 minutes to be initially greeted outside for lunch (the place had maybe 2 or 3 other tables in it at the time). I was told that a server would be right out and she was taking my drink order, then the drinks came back with another server and I was told that someone else was going to actually be taking care of me. Well, this server had waited on us before. The server is EXTREMELY slow at service and seems very inefficient at best for this kind of job. I must say though that there are a few great servers in that restaurant who actually have a personality that is engaging and also knowledgeable and I would suggest specifically asking for a server who is fun and experienced at the host stand to avoid my experiences.  Management: Also, one thing I have no seen since soft opening was an actual floor manager. I'm not sure they even have one. Never once has anyone come to my table and asked how things were. They must just really not give a care in the world about how their restaurant is seen. Because I would've had a lot to say. The food: Eh, it's burgers and the standard BJ fare. It's ok. Nothing superb, but nothing to really complain about either. I don't usually send food back anyways, and I never have here. This BJ's is at the time of this writing the newest BJ's in the Orlando area, but from my experience it is the worst kept and run.

Ellen M.,"Reno, NV",0,21,5,2.0,8/3/2015,"We went on a rainy Saturday night in high tourist season.  We called ahead for our party of 5 at about 8:30 pm and probably waited ten minutes more when we got there, which wasn't bad.  Food was typical BJs which we like, but service was very slow.  Never got drink refills and food took so long we thought they had lost our order.  We wanted dessert but didn't order due to delays.  Waitress dropped a glass at the next table and seemed put out to be cleaning up the broken glass.  Service ruined the experience for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=140
Dave W.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",8,22,26,2.0,3/20/2016,"Had the chowder, and the chicken gyro's. Food was excellent. Service was awful as waitress lost our orders and never even put then in for an hour (was too busy hanging out with her friends or family up by bar who wasn't eating but was drinking) however when food arrived 2 hrs after arrival it was excellent and management comped everything but alcohol which was more than fair. Not sure if I would recommend or not. Good management intervention and meal but poor service. Overall in reading the other reviews I would say the ones that said their Service was poor are probably pretty consistent but the ones that wrote their Service was great are probably plants because there was a lot of open tables and a lot of people waiting to get seated... clearly some of the waitresses do an excellent job there but overall I would say their service needs a tune-up which is odd because the manager seemed pretty squared away and the food was good... the atmosphere is great...they just need to do something about the weak links that are bringing their service down. That said the waitress we had was very polite though clearly very distracted by things other than work as can be evidence in losing the order for over an hour before she realizes she hadn't put it in.... kind of of conflicting review I realize. Sorry about that I guess in short if you're willing to gamble on the service the food and atmosphere are worth it..but just hope for a good waitress and if you clearly don't get one then cut your losses and leave early",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-orlando-4?start=140

I have never seen him clean his plate like that before;) We ordered the calamari (good), bacon mac n cheese (awesome) and spinach stuffed mushrooms (great.) Our waitress was very nice and honest. I was in between the steak or country fried chicken. I asked her what she prefers and she mentioned that the steaks often come out of the kitchen over cooked 50%  of the time. So based on that I ordered the chicken. And I'm glad I did!!! The gravy over the chicken and mashed potatoes was awesome! My husband however forgo her advice and ordered a ribeye, which came out over cooked. By the time  another ribeye came back mid rare, our son had finished his birthday ice cream cookie. I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but the kitchen has some work to do:( the place was half empty and there is no excuse for over cooking a steak. Hopefully they'll get their act in gear.

Sarah H.,"Orlando, FL",124,215,5,5.0,10/19/2014,"I have always been a fan of BJs. Being someone who is on a Gluten-free diet, I always support restaurants that offer GF options. BJ's even has a dedicated GF menu you can choose from which helps considering the enormous size of their regular menu. I LOVE their gluten free pizookie which is a warm chocolate chip cookie cake with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. I do wish they would offer maybe one more option for the pizookies to be gluten free but I am not upset about that considering most restaurants don't offer a single option for dessert for me to enjoy. To this day I have not found a better GF pizza than BJ's. They only offer one size like most other places for GF but it is not disappointing in the least. It is thin crust and most of their toppings are also GF so the sky's the limit, however each topping is going to cost you. I am vegetarian also so the cheese pizza is right up my alley.

Maya C.,"Jacksonville, FL",208,525,2100,4.0,12/8/2017,"Sometimes you gotta compromise. BJ's is not on my list of places I want to eat when I go out of town but when you're traveling with a friend who isn't as adventurous as you are you gotta make due. A standard chain with decent food was our choice and this place was near our hotel. She was happy, I was ""meh"". Our server was awesome though. I wish I could remember his name because everyone needs to have him wait on them. He pulls no punches and treated us like his friends. Some of the best service I'd ever had. He recommended the Avocado Egg Rolls as an app and while I initially passed on it, I decided to get them when ordering my entree. The egg rolls had avocado in them of course, but also cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, chipotle peppers and spices with a side of sweet tamarind sauce. Holy wow, these were pretty dang good. My friend took two and was done with them. No problem here, I ate the rest. She ordered mozzarella sticks and while they were good, you can get those anywhere and that's no fun. I think I'm fancy so I ordered a drink, the Blood Orange Pom Sangria but I neglected to see that the liquor is Fireball Whiskey and Merlot. Oh man. This is not a drink for an empty stomach nor to be guzzled but it is delicious.  We ordered our entrees. I chose the Seared Ahi Salad and she choose the Deep Dish Ziti. My salad was piled high with a lot of veggies. After feeling like I ate like crap at Universal this was my way of balancing everything out. It was great but I think that there was a bit too much seasoning on my ahi to my liking. I ate it anyway. My friend said her ziti was really good. I tried some and again, just ""meh"". You can really taste all the Italian seasonings and spices in it and it's not lacking in flavor at all, but it didn't WOW me.

Irene L.,"Orlando, FL",45,26,10,1.0,7/23/2017,"So I was out to lunch with two of my coworkers and we decided to visit for lunch this past Friday. We had gone to the BJ's on Millenia separately and had a great experience. That means we should have a great experience at this location, right? Wrong. We arrived at about 12:15pm and got seated immediately. The restaurant didn't seem too busy which we thought was a good sign. There were lots of empty tables in our area. After about 10 minutes, a woman that seemed like the manager asked if our server had stopped by our table yet and we explained that they did not. She proceeded to take our drink order but we didn't see our drinks until another 10 minutes later when our server finally came to our table. 20 minutes, to get a water, a sweet and an unsweet tea. Strike 1. Our server apologized for our wait and asked if we were ready to order. We were so we ordered cauliflower barbacoa tacos, penne pasta, and a California club (lightly toasted with no avocado). It took our server probably 10 minutes to put the order in the tablet. She seemed like she was struggling lowith what seemed like a simple task. Strike 2. We're already 30 minutes into our visit with no food on our table. Let me remind you, we were on our lunch break from work. So we chatted, and waited...and waited some more. Our server came to our table with a tray of drinks and was about to put one on the table. But she paused and realized the drinks weren't for our table. So she apologized for the wait (again), and said she JUST checked on our food and it should be right out. Lies. Like I said...she was struggling. We've now been at the restaurant 50 minutes with no food. Strike 3. Realizing how long we've been waiting and that we had to get back to work, our server was walking by and we asked her for our food to go. She once again apologized and said no problem and rushed back to the kitchen. Moments later, our food comes out boxed up and ready to go. Uh, what the heck happened here? She apologized again and we asked for our check. She came back with the check, another apology from the waitress, and paid cash so we can as soon as we could and not have to wait for the snail in molasses service. I've never had so many apologies in a visit to a restaurant before. Obviously, there was a problem that could not get resolved. We got our food back to work and now had cold food. My tacos tasted good but it would have been nicer to enjoy them warm. My coworkers sandwich was almost black and had huge chunks of avocado in it. What happened to lightly toasted and no avocado? So let's just say, our experience was unacceptable and we will not be visiting this location as a group or with friends or family.

The ambiance is nice! Classier than a ""normal"" neighborhood bar. The menu is very familiar, they have plenty of appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches, entrees, pastas and desserts.  My mom and I both ordered the pasta. Mom had the deep dish ziti and said it was fantastic! Plenty of pasta, cheese, sauce and meat. The pasta was served with a few pieces of garlic bread. She gave me one, and it was delicious! I was in the mood for something different (for me) and ended up in the buckwheat pasta dish. It was delicious! Plenty of pasta, chicken and broccoli with a peanut style, somewhat spicy Asian sauce. While it was a tad too much sauce, it was so tasty. I wish I could have taken it back to my hotel... The service really impressed me. They were not pushy when it came to ordering appetizers, gave us plenty of time and were so friendly!  They have a full bar!

Fred K.,"Gilbert, AZ",4,93,,3.0,4/12/2017,"I was visiting Florida and there was a BJ's across the street from the hotel we were staying in so, for familiarity sake we went here on two separate occasions for lunch and for dessert. Both times it was really slow in the restaurant which generally means quick service. Incorrect on both occasions here.  On the lunch occasion when we came in there were only 4 other tables seated. We ordered our drinks which took about 10 minutes to get to us which was weird considering it was only water and soda. I got the Thursday special which is ribs and a mini pizookie. Food came out about 25 minutes later, which again, seems like a bit of a long wait. What I found odd was that I got a full rack of ribs and they came out as two half racks which is fine. But, one half of my racks was hot and tasted good, good moisture in the ribs, great BBQ sauce covering. The other half was warm,dry,no sauce. So I am not too sure how that happens.  So we also came in a different night just for dessert at about 9PM. Again, very slow. A few people at the bar, maybe 6 tables sat. After we were sat our waitress didn't show up for at least 15 minutes. We ordered 3 pizookies to share among the 5 of us. It took them over a half an hour to get there. They were absolutely delicious and I will never say anything against the food on this occasion, but why? Why did it take that long with an empty restaurant?

Katie G.,"Hopkins, MN",29,9,20,2.0,5/20/2017,"Came for a quick lunch during my stay for a conference. The bar and restaurant had a decent amount of people but it wasn't too busy so I figured I'd be able to get in and out quickly and back to the conference. However, the bartender had all the tables and spots up to the bar, and was getting his butt kicked. As he is racing around trying to get to everyone, servers are just casually walking around minding their own business. Amidst the chaos, he messes up an order or two, and completely forgets to put into an order for another table all together. Customers had to ask for refills, silverware, their checks, etc. all things that a solid server/bartender has foresight to do before they are asked. I've been a server and manager in a restaurant so I feel his pain in being so busy that you can't catch up. It's upsetting he didn't ask for help, but I'm more disappointed in the management. Not once did the manager walk through to gage service and needs of both staff and patrons. This manager was either incompetent in his role or just didn't care. I'm not sure what is worse! The food took longer than expected and left many customers (a majority were also there from the same conference and were on a time crunch) rushing to eat when the food finally arrived. I got the California Chicken Club, which tastes good- pretty standard.  If you're looking for a quick lunch and good service, I recommend going to a different restaurant.

Nathan B.,"Windermere, FL",40,37,12,4.0,2/24/2017,"As a local Orlando resident who lives near I-Drive, this is one of our go to chain restaurants in the I-drive area. The food is consistently good, and the menu has a wide variety of both food and drink items for every person. Their price point is also lower than other brew house/sports bars like Yard House. They also have a great curbside/takeout system where food is always been packaged well and still warm once we get home to eat it.  My favorite items are their healthy entrees, especially the noodle/quinoa/rice bowls. Their pizza and burgers are good too! I'm not a big fan of their appetizers as its all just yesterday's cheese, meat and vegetables fried plus a dipping sauce and then priced too high. But that's my opinion of appetizers at many chain restaurants. If you come here and don't order a dessert you're missing out! Their pizookies are like nothing else and never fail to impress.
