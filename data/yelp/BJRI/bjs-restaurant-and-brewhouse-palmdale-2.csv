Thank you, BJ's for honoring and appreciating our military veterans.  5 out 5 Stars.  Highly recommend! 11 Nov 17:   1655 hrs - Check in for waiting list 1734 hrs - Text message received for table 1756 hrs - Waitress finally takes our drink and food order 1816 hrs - Meal served Shrimp pasta was runny and bland.

Milton A.,"Rosamond, CA",66,69,24,4.0,10/7/2017,"This is probably my favorite BJ's now. We used the app to be put on the preferred wait list about an hour prior to us showing up. We were a little worried when we pulled up though as we noticed lots of patrons waiting outside. Our worries we quickly placated upon checking in as we were seated within five minutes. It took about 5 minutes to be greeted by our server, Luis, who was exceptional by the way. This was ok on my part because the place was busy! We ordered beers and calamari for starters. Sadly the appetizer went back because it was just too salty and I'm watching my blood pressure. Luis was great and had it taken off the bill. I ordered the prime rib, medium and my wife had the pizza and daughter the boneless wings. Everything was fantastic! The food, the service, the atmosphere. All three of us dined for less than $100 and had four beers! Great value, great food! I definitely recommend and we'll be going back again in the future. Cheers! Oh and the churro Pizookie is so good!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2
Mary B.,"Palmdale, CA",26,7,,2.0,1/10/2018,"Went there last night for a friends bday. The worst service we have ever had, waiter literally rolled his eyes when my friend starting asking questions about the food.

Demi A.,"Los Angeles, CA",441,305,697,4.0,11/29/2017,"I built up an appetite from shopping at the mall across the way so I mozied over to BJ's.  I didn't have high expectations since I've tried a few of their dishes several times over the years and it was just your typical chain restaurant food...HOWEVER!  I sat at the bar and the person next to me had the deep dish personal combination pizza.  It looked really good, and he said it was good but it also looked like I would never be able to finish it.  As recommended by the bartender I opted for the California Club Flatbread pizza.  This pizza is out of this world good!  I know I know big statement, it's definitely a must try, I also ordered the Caesar salad-wilted lettuce, perhaps from sitting in a bowl of dressing all night, the salad was definitely a miss for me.  I should have sent it back but 'Wendy Williams' always suggests to never send your food back because you don't know if there is a disgruntled employee behind the scenes.  lol  I also ordered the cookie, salted caramel with ice cream!  This was amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2
Mike R.,"Palmdale, CA",2,24,2,1.0,10/2/2017,"We normally enjoy dining in at BJ's so we thought we'd try the curbside pickup for Monday Night Football. This review and rating is based solely on tonight's curbside order. Placing the on-line order was fairly easy; Pick the store location, select your items, request the pickup time, and done.    My order for the BJ's Favorite pizza was placed at 6:30 for a 7:15 pickup time. (45 min should be plenty of time to make a pizza.) Paused the MNF game at 7:05 and headed over to pick up the pizza.  Got there at 7:15, parked in the curbside pickup space (in the back), and called the number to say I was here to pick up my order.  I was told it'll be right out.  We waited, and waited, and waited... at 7:30 I called again and said I was waiting for 15 minutes. They again said it'll be out in a minute. 10 minutes later (25 min total), I headed inside. As I almost reached the door I saw my pizza was being delivered but I stopped him and asked to speak with a manager.  I explained the waiting and two calls to the manager and she started explaining something about being busy.  I told her I placed my order 45 min early and then waited for 25 min after the expected time.  She didn't say anything to that so after an awkward pause, I said they can keep the pizza and I'll get one elsewhere.  She that said I can just have the pizza without charge, and then something about their ratings.  (Couldn't hear because it was loud.) So we took the pizza but after getting home and opening it, I realized I should have just left it there. This pizza was nothing like we've had there before. It was light on toppings, dry--almost like they forgot sauce--and with burnt edges.  We ate just over half the pizza and threw out the rest. (We never throw out left over pizza!)  Yeah, it was that bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2
William B.,"Long Beach, CA",23,142,85,1.0,9/24/2017,"I eat out a lot and rarely write reviews of chain restaurants like BJ's.  I remember eating at one of their original locations on 2nd St in Belmont Shore.  Our experience here today on our raid trip home was nothing short of horrendous.  Our server, Brooke F, wasn't entirely to blame but her complete indifference to the fact that the food we waited 75 minutes for came out cold certainly exacerbated the situation.  You'd need a pair of those light up orange flashlights they use at LAX to guide in airliners just to get her attention...and when you've got her attention, you'd better be quick because she couldn't wait to leave our table.   Our pizza came out cold and soggy, chicken wings were cold, and salmon frigid.  Not that Brooke would know...we kept waiting for the unceremonious ""how is your food,"" but it never came, so we never had the opportunity to respond, ""terrible thanks."" Brook might consider a role in a different industry.  BJ's might want to consider staffing their kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2

Kolton M.,"New Orleans, LA",19,52,200,4.0,5/27/2017,"It was a nice Friday night. The place was packed. It's a regular hot spot. There was a nice size line (40 min at 8pm) but we were able to slide right in to a table in the bar area.  Unfortunately it was pretty loud and a bit hard to hear. Our server was really on top of things though especially being he was slammed. He was no slouch. He seemed to make it a point to keep a friendly and attentive attitude.  I had the spicy pig pizza. The outer crust was crispy the inner pizza was a bit more soft. Loaded with bacon ham and plenty of pineapples and jalapeños, it had a sweet and spicy kick that complimented one another well. My friends (who are regulars) had the Mediterranean tacos and Santa Fe salad.  I was a little saddened I opted for the cheaper item, the two seated next to us had a rack of ribs and it looked amazing. They were a friendly pair as were several others we crossed paths with.

Mila D.,"Palmdale, CA",23,87,1,2.0,9/11/2017,"Okay this review is a tad late and I hesitated on writing it at all, but after my second visit last month it was long over due. First and foremost I want to commend the waitresses I had they were very lovely and knew how to serve us without being overbearing ( mind you I was on a date). Food was okay. The golden beet and arugula salad tasted like the lettuce was about to expire. My biggest complaint is with the drinks. For some reason the alcoholic beverages are not made properly. And trust me I know what I am talking about I was a bartender and server for 10 years. They need to re-train their bartenders on how to make drinks. You don't just fill a cup with ice and pour freely.  Please work with you bartenders on this. This is my second time experiencing poorly made drinks and I'm tired of sending them back. I'm going to stop coming if this keeps happening. Thank you",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2

Marie Z.,"Norwalk, CA",5,1,,1.0,1/2/2018,"I absolutely hate doing this cause I always look for good in every situation. unfortunately there was nothing good about this my first trip to Palmdale Bj's. First we walked and sat in  the bar staff was friendly , ordered drinks it was a special night New year's day. My  great friend was celebrating an acceptance to a school. We ordered drinks, appetizer platter .They came about twenty min later  dropped off platter and walked away .No silverware ,no plates or napkins we waited for some one to come by nothing. Finally she brought plates, walked away and came back gave us one silverware setting and said "" well here is one for now I'll go look for the others ""I just thought well they must have been busy  ten min later, she comes back with silverware .Mind u we were pretty much done with appetizer . We ordered two steak plates and a brisket burger. About forty five min later she says"" ur food should be coming "" twenty min later she came back and said"" manager is with ur food now ""We were confused.  Finally food came out  ,I started to cut my steak and it was raw inside .Hesitant to send it back ,my friend said hers was to. My broccoli was completely disgusting ,her mashed potatoes were swimming in blood .I could not eat the steak ,so I sent it back and apologized  for complaining. Steak was returned ,by that time I wanted to leave. Asked for a box and the check. She didn't come back ,I had to look for her. The waitress looked tired and annoyed, we finally got our check and I tipped her twenty dollars and said ""u have had a long day and I appreciated her effort"" we walk over to pay and was waiting no one acknowledge us. Then the manager came over and we were paying with a egift card, we received as a gift   the manager runs the card and it declined, he then said that we needed to check the card on their site. He tried again and said it was declined .I had to pay for our food .He said that we would have to call and get another gift card not only was food bad ,but service was too we then left. I contacted the website and check gift card 3 times and was valid and had 100 dollars I was so furious and humiliated. I will never return to this location ever again .Now I have a freaking gift card I will never use ,cause BJ's Palmdale  I will not visit or reccomend  to anyone ever. I love BJ's Montebello. Amazing location but this one here is a complete disaster. They treated me and my friends like they were too busy to help us at all.

The cocktails we ordered took a while... a lot longer than expected, but I guess the bottle needed to make my drink was empty and had to be replaced. Anyway, once our food came it was business as usual; the check in to see if we were satisfied. But her trips to the table were few and far between... granted it was late and she could've just been off tonight, but I'm not really satisfied.

Our waiter seemed so overwhelmed with the amount of table he had to tend to so I don't blame him but service was extremely slow.  Our night: my boyfriend and I got there around 5pm on Friday had to wait 30 minutes for a table for 2 (no big deal. They seemed busy) got seated and the waiter didn't come over to our table until about 20 minutes after. He took our order and drink, another 20 minutes go by for drinks, 40 for food. Now I don't mind waiting if the food was worth it but it was definitely not! I asked for my steak well done and if came back medium rare... I'm not the one to complain or send the food back so I just ate my mashed potatoes and drank my watered down lemonade. Wasn't even in the mood for desert anymore since medium rare steak makes me extremely nauseous.

Second bad experience was at Palmdale location. Walked in and place is more than half empty at 11:45 am. Hostess asked for my name and said to wait .

When I brought this pizza home, I realized the pizza was baked on a bread! U could see the top of the bread under the toppings. This pizza was a failure too. By now I was in no mood of consuming the pizza nor calling them.

Monica W.,"Palmdale, CA",76,3,1,2.0,6/6/2017,"Went here today for lunch. It was very busy due to graduations and there was a long wait for a table so we sat at the bar. Now given that it was busy its understandable that the food took a little longer than normal to come but when the food came I specifically asked if I should order my pizookie now so that it would be ready by the time we finished eating and packed to go since we had to head back to work. The server said oh no it comes out right away, better wait till you are almost done eating. So I did. 20min. later I'm a little irritated that I  am still waiting for this pizookie to come out, finally it does and we leave. Get to work open it up and become immediately irritated again! What I got does not even look like a pizookie. Very disappointed and doubt I will be going back to BJ's for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=40
Linh U.,"Alhambra, CA",111,40,112,3.0,6/25/2017,"Consistency is key to good food/restaurants. Unfortunately this particular BJ's doesn't have it. Some days the food, the rib eye in particular, is amazing, and other times, it's absolute trash. Funny enough, I've had the better cooked version when I had ordered it to go. I dined in last night with the boyprend and family, and 5 people out of 7 ordered the steak. Only one person got theirs cooked just right. The rest of the medium rares were practically medium well to well done. I know you can always ask them to take it back, but there's always that risk that the chef will be unhappy and do something unpleasant to your meal lol.. I liked when one of the servers was asking us to cut into 2 of our steaks prior, but two other servers came out with the last steaks and just dropped them and ran. Even A1 couldn't save the dry chewy piece of moo that was given to us. At least the sides were somewhat redeeming of the meal itself.  On the bright side, the alcohol is pretty good here. The frozen strawberry splash was delicious, it just tastes like a strawberry smoothie. Their Long Island ice teas are bomb as well. They have a lot of options but they can get heavy with the ice.

Daniel J.,"Pasadena, CA",219,79,814,4.0,10/5/2015,"My family and I have gone to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse a few times over the years, and we always enjoy our visits.  More recently, we came twice within the last month, and this review is based on these two visits.  Here's a quick summary on the details of this rating, for both visits:      - Atmosphere.............................5 stars      - Efficiency.................................4 stars      - Host.........................................5 stars      - Waitress...................................5 stars       - Our meals................................3 stars      - Overall rating...........................3+ / 4- stars The atmosphere at BJ's is really nice. They've got a great bar area, plenty of seating options for larger parties, and nice cozy seating areas for those out on a date.  It has a nice layout, is well lit inside and has a good wholesome feel to it.  My family and I were quickly seated, for both of our recent visits, in a nice big booth in one corner of the restaurant and it was rather pleasant both times.   During our first visit, we were seated by a nice young lady in a corner booth during a busy time.  She was friendly, but I don't remember her name.  During our most recent visit, we were seated by Jonathan, and he was extremely professional and friendly.  We waited for just a few minutes while he did everything he could to quickly find us a nice big booth for my large family.  BJ's is lucky to have Jonathan; he's a real pro! During our first visit, our waitress was Jolin, and she was friendly, professional, and she had a great personality. We had a few tricky orders specifically related to food allergies and she was very patient in explaining details related to ingredients in their food. She also provided us with a menu detailing the items that they have related to folks with allergies. She was awesome!  Also, thanks to the management at BJ's for creating this menu, because it is really helpful for families like mine.   During our most recent visit, we had Kaytlen as our waitress.  Once again, we were lucky to get another totally awesome waitress that was friendly and patient with our complicated orders.  Kudos again to the management at BJ's for hiring awesome waitresses!    Our meals were pretty good during both of our visits, but each time there was something disappointing about the meal. During our first visit, my kids' meals looked delicious and they were all impressed.  My meal, on the other hand, was below average during our first visit, where the bacon cheeseburger I ordered appeared to have unusually fatty and low-quality bacon on it.  The bacon seemed to reduce the overall experience of eating the burger instead of the opposite.     Our meals during our second visit were opposite, where my meal was above average and my kids' meals were below average.  The disappointment during this latter visit included two pizza meals that were noticeably over-cooked, and a delayed meal delivery for one of my kids by several minutes, in addition to it having an incorrect side dish.      In summary, I think that BJ's is a great option for lots of folks in the AV with an excellent atmosphere and an awesome staff that interacts with their customers.  This BJ's could definitely do a better job in the kitchen, where arguably the most important function of any restaurant takes place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=40

Our name was called no later than 5 minute wait time ( perfect). Got seated ask for a high chair my husband and I are dining with a 2 year old. We waited about 10 minutes before someone came to ask for our drink order. (Our 2 year old was getting very impatient) finally came and got an order on our drinks. I asked for a Paloma which the waitress explained to me she wouldn't recommend so I asked for a black berry margarita which she said was her favorite. The drink was very bitter I wouldn't recommend it or maybe we caught the bartender on a wrong night. We order the artichoke and spinach dip with chips appetizer took about 15 to 20 minutes for it to come out... when it did it was warm to cold as if it had been sitting there for a while. Which was weird because the bowl the dip was in was really hot so I don't know how the dip would be cold. Finally ordered our meals came out great on time and hot. We order a pazookie for dessert the cookie was very under cooked under the top layer was pure dough the flavor was great texture not so much. I'm leaving the review for the service although our waitress was not rude she was not as attentive to our table as she was with other tables she was serving our empty plates stayed there so there was a lot of clutter on our table she never came to ask us for refill even for our toddler. I hadn't been to bjs in years because every time I past by its always packed with a 45 minute wait time. You would think it would be better.

I had to look for a manager and actually talk to her. Nobody was apologetic, finally I had to ask for water since I was still thirsty. But guess what that bill sure did come on time. Never once was I asked how the meal went. This sis not the first time come here for work many times and they always struggle with large parties.

I told her that's exactly how it should be. When it came to me the egg was small and cooked over medium with little yolk. My husband had Parmesan chicken which was fine. The food had been dropped off by another server who basically put the lukewarm food on the table quickly and ran off. No ketchup for the fries and our server didn't return to the table for another 20 minutes. In fact we probably only saw her 3 times. That was enough to know she had an odd sense of humor.

Reyna S.,"Acton, CA",0,28,3,1.0,6/16/2017,"It is very unfortunate things have been going south for BJ's. My last three dining experiences have been each worse than the last. I keep trying because I used to like the food (pizzas etc.). My second to last experience the waitress pocketed cash intended for the bill and over charged my credit card. Then pretended to be confused. I did not report her to the manager because I was in a hurry to get to my next engagement. The last experience was 6-10-17. The food was less than good. The waitress brought my grandmothers salmon to her and after a few minutes the waitress returned and said it was the wrong one and took it away. It appeared that she gave to to a nearby table. My grandmother had already touched it. I usually enjoy fish tacos and I could not finish mine as they were doused in too much sauce. The pepper jar was not screwed on correctly and the entire jar of pepper fell into my sisters chicken and rice meal. She couldn't finish her meal either. My mother ordered a cheese appetizer (mozzarella cheese sticks) and was brought pot-stickers instead. At this point I asked for the check because I wanted to leave. 15 minutes later we had not received the check. We asked for refills and never received refills. The waitress returned with one refill for the wrong type of soft drink. My mother couldn't drink it. Mid way through the meal I wanted a high chair and an extra plate both of which I had to retrieve myself because I was tired of waiting. The waitress did take the ruined chicken and rice meal off the bill. I quickly signed the receipt/bill because my 9 month old was getting fussy from all the waiting and went outside. We were waiting in the hot car for my mother to join us but instead I received a call from my mother saying the waitress was holding her hostage inside the restaurant because she did not see the signed bill.  I had my baby hysterical in the car at this point and I couldn't leave the restaurant without my mother. I had the baby so my disabled grandmother walked the copy of the receipt I kept in my purse back into the restaurant. Again, I was late to my next engagement because this experience took too long. I should've reported this to the manager.  Update: The manager contacted me to attempt to correct this situation. I want to believe that the establishment was understaffed and therefore we had this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=60

The server kept forgetting our drinks and continued to be one lousy peace of work. After 45 min I had to ask the manager where my food was and it came out by far I had better spaghetti and meatballs in the military.

Samantha C.,"Palmdale, CA",53,8,,1.0,6/26/2017,"I can honestly say I'm not that big of a fan of the food here but today I decided to do it for lunch. I chose the option for curbside pick up which is behind the building oddly instead of the front or side where it would be easier for the waiters to bring the food. The sign for the curbside tells you to call the number listed and that they would come right out. I tried calling this number 18 times. For it to tell me it's busy and to try back later. I assumed that would be the store number. So I didn't try to look up a different number. Then after sitting there for 15 mins. I decided to look them up. To my surprise there was another number. I called and spoke with a woman and started to tell her about the issues with the number listed. She cut me off to say that isn't her problem with attitude. Said it doesn't usually do that so it must be a problem with my phone. She than proceeded to ask my name so she can pull my order. I stated and name and said my food it gonna be cold. Her words were well it's been in under the warmer so it will be fine. She brought out my food and took my card to go back inside to run my payment. I noticed as she went to do that, that my grilled cheese was solid. And nasty. That the soup I ordered had already started to get chunky from being cold. I also noticed I didn't receive the fries that came with the sandwich. So when she brought me my card I stated to her, the fries were missing. Her response was oh well it doesn't come with them. I corrected her and said yes. Because when I ordered online it didn't give me the option to not get them. She than said well than you online must have messed up. Not my problem. I guess I'll go grab you some. She came back and the fries were cold. But at this point I was so done, I just wanted to leave and not come back. I get things happen. And it can't be perfect.

We listened to our pizza loving son to go there, but today was by far the worse service and will be the last time I ever go to bjs in Palmdale! First we were asked for phone number to get a text message when our table would be ready and they didn't seat us after 10 minutes of getting the text our table was ready. I even asked the hostess I got the text is our table ready after getting up from where we were waiting. So after we get seated we have the waiter come and get our drink order after a good 10 mins there, so we tell him we are ready to order, he says sure he took down our order. After about 20 minutes our food comes my son was already asking why are they taking extra long to bring our food, so the waiter brings my sons pizza and lemonade and usually we argue with my son not to finish all the lemonade so fast today he said it tasted weird and it kind of did, later after 10 mins my food comes and he mumbles to my husband  there was a mishap with your order it'll be right out, I wanted to wait to eat with my husband but my food was getting cold he brought over some ranch and didn't say a word to where the burger was at, at this point we are all upset I didn't even have two bites of my food we had to get up and leave we had already lost our appetite so we got up and my husband spoke to the hostess and manager came over now she was justifying her employees but we were done.

The salad came out after a reasonable time.  However, the salad barely resembled what I am used to. Being a national chain, I expect it to be same at each location.  This salad was missing avocado, had way too much corn, the lettuce was soggy and the ""grilled"" chicken seemed soggy like it was microwaved (no grill marks at all).  Also, the corn and tomatoes were almost definitely out of cans, which I hate the flavor of. The location I usually go always has fresh tasting lettuce and veggies.  That being said, I did not complain at the time because I was hungry.  I was served relatively quickly for a crowded place, but I did notice several others at the bar waiting for drink refills or to tab out while the two bartenders chatted away.  I don't think I'll waste my time here again while I'm in town.

The hosts are always cheerful, the staff is always pleasant, and the food always meets my expectations.  They have a pretty good Happy Hour.

The Avocado Egg Rolls are incredible, a must try if you haven't already. My absolute favorite dish is the Chicken Alfredo with angel hair pasta.

Its a grilled cheese sandwich, people. It should not have taken so long. I should have accepted the ahi salad that was brought to me but meant for another table. At least I would have eaten sooner. It may well have been better than my sandwich anyhow. The sandwich was subpar. The toast tasted of rancid oil. The bacon and avocado was good and the tomato acceptable. That toast though, no bueno. Also, the garlic lemon aioli dipping sauce wasn't quite as advertised. I tasted neither garlic nor lemon. There was something pungent I picked up on. Then I got a chunk. It was bleu cheese dressing.

What was RIGHT:  Isaac.  He is a star server - personable, engaging, attentive and thorough.  Unfortunately, after taking our drink and appetizer order, management sent him on a break and gave us to another server.  Because I don't know why the next events happened and if he had a hand in the break-down in customer service, I won't name the follow-up server. What was WRONG: ** The App -- there is NO cell signal in the restaurant (for AT&T) and even the guest Wi-Fi wouldn't allow me even enough of a signal to log into the app. ** Appetizers -- We ordered three appetizers: artichoke dip, calamari, and a kid's appetizer (thank you for telling us about this Isaac) which consisted of a garlic knot and some fruit.  The calamari made it out first with the artichoke dip following a few minutes later.  The bread and fruit took about 15 minutes MORE than the other two. ** Drinks -- I ordered one adult beverage at the start of the meal.  At no time was I ever asked if I wanted a refill, a different beverage or a glass of water.  I finally asked for water toward the end of the meal.  Other drinks were refilled about half as often as they should have.  Each time a drink was refilled, there was next to no ice.  We asked for a glass of ice and it took 3 requests and 20 minutes of waiting before we were able to get it. ** Entrees -- within the group, we ordered a pizza, spaghetti and meatballs, kids spaghetti, a pasta dish with soup and a taco plate.  10 minutes after ordering, our server (not Isaac) returned to say that they were out of spaghetti and meatballs and asked one of my guests to choose something else.  It took another 10 minutes for the server to return to take the new order.  I tried to ask if they'd be able to fulfill the rest of the order (pizza was supposed to have meatballs on it and kids spaghetti was...well, spaghetti) but he left while I was talking.  Perhaps he was pre-occupied and didn't realize I was making an inquiry.  We waited somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour for our entrees.  Other tables were seated, ate and were preparing to leave before we got our food.  Our original server, Isaac, left for his break and came back before our food was delivered.  When it was, the pizza had no meatballs and the soup was never delivered. ** Take-away boxes -- it's hard to believe that this could get messed up, but it, I kid you not, even that wasn't done with any thought for the guest.  I had 2/3 of the pizza left.  Our server did not bring out a pizza box, instead brought a couple of small styrofoam containers.   At that point, having seen Isaac on the floor, I finally asked if we could have him back for the last few minutes of our service.  I'm sure this didn't make the server that was handling our table very happy, but the night was a disaster.  I was trying to at least redeem dessert. ** Dessert -- we ordered the pizooki trio.  While the flavor was very good, they were severely overcooked around the edges.  This was our ""on the house"" comp for the troubles we'd reported to the manager.  It was severely lacking and very disappointing. ** Check -- We were there on a Monday which is supposed to be half-price pizza day.  Our pizza was originally rung up at full price.  The soup that I'd requested be removed from the bill since we never received it, was still there.  There were evidently other issues as well to which I'm not privy since someone else was treating me to dinner for my birthday.  All I know is that the check had to be sent back at least once for discrepancies.  I do NOT attribute these to Isaac because the issues had to do with what was put in by the other server.  Isaac was very quick to resolve the issues once pointed out. I said at the start of this that I was disappointed to write this review and that is true.  The food here is generally good and it's got a good variety for groups.  That said, considering our latest experience, it won't be at the forefront of my mind next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=80

It was pretty busy, but we only waited a few minutes before being seated. I forget our waitresses name, but she was very friendly and attentive.  I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken, which was thinly cut chicken with a nice even layer of parmesan cheese that had a nice golden color that was topped with sun dried tomatoes and came with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The whole dish was pretty big and would be plenty for two people to split. Since it only takes me a few bites to get full, I took the other piece of chicken with the potatoes home. This dish is definitely better when it comes straight from the kitchen. I ate the dish the following day and of course it wasn't as good.  My hubs ordered the jalapeño burger, which was a pretty big sized burger that also came with a side of seasoned potato wedges. The burger was pretty delicious and cooked medium well. For two entrees and a pop, our total came out to around $32. Not bad for a delicious meal. We were way too stuffed to get dessert, but definitely looking forward to coming back! The noise level can definitely get loud when their busy, but not loud enough where you're having to scream to your dinner-mate.

My husband and I used to love coming to this place, and the rating is not about the food my rating is more so about the service we received, which has led us to never go to this particular location again. We arrived when it was kind of a rush hour so we had to wait about 30mins to be seated which I was perfectly fine with. Once we were seated we literally sat for about 25mins without anyone coming to our table to take our drink order or anything ? Or atleast let us know that they would be with us shortly. And to my surprise another party was seated in the table next to us after we had waited that long and they had a waiter on the spot right away !! They took out their drinks and their order while we still had no waiter come to our service. So finally my friend went over to the front to let them know what was going on and the employee said he would get that checked out right away! Which he didn't we still sat for another 10 minutes or so, at this point I was over it and asked to speak to the manager. The manager I will say was mediocre!!! She took no responsibility and offered no apology all she said was ""I'll see what's going on"" finally a waiter arrived about 20 minutes later to take our order and said hello how are you and my friend responded with I'm hungry and she had the nerve to look annoyed and respond with well hello hungry !! I was so done ! I said how are we going to receive bad service and on top of that have the waiter be sarcastic? Nope not cool!! The manager never came back to see if we were okay or anything ! I just want to say I was not looking to get a free meal or any discount but it would have been nice if the manager would have taken responsibility as a manager and apologized. It's not a restaurant where a meal is $5 so I expect to have decent customer service and even if it was just a $5 meal I'm still paying my hard earned money so i should be able to get good customer service. Manager definitely needs to be more responsible in making sure customers are satisfied! Not to say I have two babies and we usually like to order quickly so that they don't get fussy !!

They talk to each other and ignore us until they're ready to seat! You need to at least acknowledge people and say hello we will be right with you!

Waitress was slow, and rude acted like she despised her job. Not friendly at all took 17 minutes to bring out waters and then didn't bring out my nephews juice with the water had to wait again.  My mom ordered the steak medium well it came out over well with char on it. Sent it back and the waitress comes back to tell us it will be a 45 min wait to cook her steak correctly they are busy. Excuse me we will all be done eating by then. She says nothing I can do you'll have to wait. I told her to forget about it we don't want it.  Then we ask for to go boxes and the check she walks past us atleast 4 times before acknowledging us and then I had to ask again for the check and to go boxes.  She finally brings it and tells me oh by the way I went ahead and to the steak off so you don't have to pay for it. Well no shit I'm not paying for a meal we sent back without even a bite of. Smh.

They showed up burnt beyond recognition, a burnt dog turd would have been more impressive. It makes me sad, I have been to BJ's a few times and never had anything good to say, about the food or service. Go to the Asian place next door, great Pho, great service. I would only order beer at this place, if I ever return. The food and service seems to always be overpriced and mediocre, at BJ's. Try the Asian place next to it, much better, service and food.

Asked for ranch to maybe make them taste a Lil better and that took about 20 minutes to get. After that I tried flagging down our server multiple times just to get the check or at least some more tea or water (she never offered to get us a refill) finally asked to split the bill so we could leave and the server just looked at us in a disapointing ""for real?"" Kind of way. I didn't complain or say anything while I was there  because I didn't have time to wait. I'm an advanced heart failure patient awaiting a heart tranplant and have battery powered pumps that keep me alive. My batteries were running low and needed to get out of there quick. I got the check left a generous tip (as I always do) and left. The more I thought about it the more mad I got. Like ""hey that was kind of total bullshit!!!""

Leah D.,"California City, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/28/2016,"My husband and I have recently added BJ's to our ""frequent places to eat list"" because their food is consistently delicious. We always start with their boneless wings with the spicy pepper BJ's wing sauce. The sauce is fantastic and they are breaded and cooked to   husband really enjoys the flat bread pizza. And I take on the carbs with the pan style pizza. We are always more than happy with the food and the service is pretty good too.  And then this week we had the Jacob experience! When we were seated, I noticed our server was handling between 10-15 tables. When he came to introduce himself and take our drink order he was friendly and did not seem stressed AT ALL with the amount of tables he was working. I am in love with the infusion peach tea while my husband loves their house root beer. From the jump, Jacob was SUPER!! He is like the super hero of servers! When I asked for extra ranch for the wings (I am a sauce-aholich) Jacob brought me a LARGE side of ranch (typically servers bring an itty-bitty ramekin). He understood what I meant when I told him I needed a lot of ranch. I have a tendency to drink a lot of tea especially with a spicy dish. Jacob refilled me about 5 times, never going a minute without a drink! He even hooked us up with drinks to go when we were finished. He checked in with us the perfect amount of times (not an annoying amount) throughout our dining experience.  He is a great server...and he is super nice! He is the type of person you would want to hang out with. He goes that ""extra mile"" several times throughout your dinner.

Nicole V.,"Malibu, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/11/2017,"Okay, I feel the need to write this review now because I don't think it is fair that anyone else experience what I did. So I made a reservation 2 days ahead of the date I needed for a party of 18 and I was assured a spot for 7pm which was perfect. My party consisted of adults & 3 kids. When I called on the day of the reservation the hostess on the phone assured me that my table would be ready and there was a 10 min window. Having this info I let my friends and family know that it was good to head on over there at 7. Well, we arrived at 7pm and the hostess said my table wasn't ready and it would be a 25min wait. Long story short after about 50 minutes of waiting to be seated when I have made a freaking reservation the manger assured me that they were doing they beat they could. At this point I was furious. The little ones we're hungry & exhausted and my birthday dinner at this point was ruined. They finally got their crap together after an hour of waiting and complaining and got our party a table. The service was okay. I was not impressed. The manager did comp my meal & the kids meals (which was the bare minimum) but what really ruined the night after all the crap we had already gone through was that my BIRTHDAY pazoki never came out, no one sang happy birthday, my waitress never showed up again & I had to ask another waiter for my birthday Pazoki to go. I was so upset and disappointed. Lesson learned for that day: BJs doesn't care if you make a reservation or not.

I waited about 5 minutes more for my wine. She takes our order and my husband tell her no chipolet on the Avocado burger I don't like spicy. She takes my order and off she goes. People who ordered after us were getting their orders before ours which we thought odd. Not once did she come and check on us and it ended up that their were Jalapeno's on the burger and by that time my husband ran out of tea and was on fire. She never came back until we were nearly done. He mentioned that their were jalapenos which made the burger unpleasant to eat. She argued you said no Chipolet and we said nothing spicy.

Leonard S.,"Palmdale, CA",48,95,266,4.0,1/18/2014,"Yesterday we had dinner for my wife's birthday. There were 7 people in our group which include my two boys. Our server (Robert) came to out table & introduced himself. Right off the bat, he started cracking jokes which made the mood really friendly & fun. He was a great server!!! I wish there were more servers like him which enjoy their job.  We started off with a appetizer platter. It consist of avocado egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, artichoke dip & spring rolls. Everything was hot & tasted really good. My favorite are the avocado egg rolls. Definitely, try them out. I also had a cup of the calm chowder. I think it's one of the best chowder I have ever had. It was really hot which is perfect. There were plenty of clams in the cup.  For dinner, I decided to try the Cajun pasta with chicken & shrimp. I was so full after all the appetizers & my soup. My plate was really full & most important it was hot. I only had a couple bites of my food.  It was really good. I loved the seasonings they used in pasta. Unfortunately, I couldn't eat it all. So, I took most of it home. My wife had the balsamic glazed chicken. She also took her dinner home.  My kids had the chicken Alfredo & the spaghetti. They both finished their dinner. So apparently, they loved it lol. Both my kids really enjoyed their dinner. We finished the night with dessert we had the famous pizookie.

Is that customer service?  Really?  Too bad, so sad.  Your party is too big and we can't seat or feed you.  Out of all the restaurants in the A.V. - and below - my daughter chose BJ's.  So frustrated and irritated - I called Yardhouse.  A very pleasant young lady told me that they could accommodate our party and we had the choice of the outdoor patio or inside. To me - customers are customers.  Either you're open for business to serve food or not.  You shouldn't discriminate against large parties, or if you seem to have a lot of large parties - maybe you should advertise on your website that these reservations need to be in advance.

Mike D.,"Palmdale, CA",385,349,2091,4.0,7/20/2012,"I read reviews here that are all over the place for BJ's Palmdale so after my first visit (which was good) I decided that I would wait till I had a couple of visits under my belt before passing judgement. Today was my fourth visit and I have not had a problem with the food or service. My first visit was for dinner, I was to meet up with a group of about 8 people. I arrived a little early just as two others in our party were arriving. We  were the first to arrive, reservations had been made and we were immediately seated. The other members of our party soon arrived and although the restaurant was crowded our orders were taken right away. After a fairly short wait considering the amount of patrons our orders were brought to us. I ordered the Cajun Pasta which consisted of blackened chicken breast with a creamy tomato sauce , roasted red peppers and red onions tossed with fettuccini noodles and topped Parmesan cheese and green onions. I enjoyed the meal, finding it very flavorful with the chicken being tender and juicy. I only ate half to save room for desert. The waitress came by and boxed what was left of my Cajun Pasta and I ordered the Pizookie which consists of a large chocolate chip cookie in a pan topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. The Pizookie was very good and even though I had only eaten half of my pasta I was unable to finish it, but I did come close.  My next three visits were for lunch after seeing a movie at Cinemark which is right next door. To keep this review from getting too long I will give this blanket statement that will cover these three visits as they were all very similar. I will list all the meals and post photos of them as well. I was seated and waited on quickly. My meals were brought to me quickly, I tried three of their lunch specials and enjoyed them all! Here is a list of my three lunches:  Enlightened Barbacoa Tacos $5.95 (Lunch Special) Corn tortillas filled with spicy, tender barbacoa beef , topped with cabbage, Baja sauce and pico de gallo. Served with black beans and a tangy slaw of shredded cabbage and jalapeno pickled carrots and onions. Chicken Quesadilla $5.95 (Lunch Special) Grilled marinated chicken, green chilies and Jack and Cheddar cheese melted in a crispy tortilla then drizzeld with avocado cream sauce and sprinkled with cilantro. Served with fire-roasted tomato salsa, Baja sauce, sour cream and black beans. Parmesan Crusted Chicken sandwich $6.50 (Lunch Special) Parmesan crusted chicken breast topped with a fresh tomato basil blend and melted provolone cheese with mayonnaise, shredded lettuce and creamy garlic dressing on a toasted French roll.  Served with wedge-cut seasoned fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=220

The chicken was disgusting and 3.50 extra if you want a salad included. Jeez! I feel like there just raising prices and giving out less just to make more money.

I don't say OMG, but OMG! Lol this thing is the bomb. This is the best overall experience I've had at a restaurant it a while the server did her job 100%!

Nellie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,235,162,1.0,9/7/2015,"I actually feel bad for having to leave 1 star because I have been a customer at this BJ's for almost 10 years now.  I have had numerous celebration dinners here including my high school graduation dinner.  My best friend's birthday was on 9/5/15 and we threw her a surprise birthday dinner here (we also celebrated her 18th birthday here). We had a party of 14. Everything started off fine until our waiter, Domenic, came to the table to take our order. Something was wrong with him. He was bothered, annoyed, frustrated, angry, just plain RUDE!!! First of all, he came to the table rushing us to take our order. I had to tell him numerous times that I wasn't ready yet. As I stated, I've been there plenty of times so I wanted to try something new so I asked him if he tried an item on the menu and his response was just dry and nonchalant, just letting me know I was getting on his nerves. We were thinking at the table maybe he is overwhelmed by our party size because he was working the table mostly by himself. The food took about 20 minutes to come out and it was cold. We weren't going to complain because once again we had a large party so we just dealt with it and we didn't want to have any problems. We just wanted to enjoy our meal. The finally straw happened when my friend stopped Domenic while he was walking by (he never checked on us after the food was served) and he got mad, stopped, looked at her and said,  ""I'm going to take another order, what?"" She was shocked of course and asked for extra dressing. He took over 5 minutes to come back with the condiments. Then someone else at our table asked for water refills then he responded in a nasty attitude, ""Well how many do you need?"" That was it for us! Done! Our waiter was acting as if we were asking for him to go to his house, make our food and bring it back to the restaurant! I was astonished. We started to look around for someone who looked like a manager and we found him. Someone from the table got up and spoke to him about everything that had happened and his response was he was going to take care of it....Well him taking care of it was giving us 2 new waiters. That was it. No type of accommodation for his employee ruining our dinner. He didn't come to speak to our table either. We wanted to order more drinks and dessert but we were scared something would happen to our food so we paid and left.  I have never in my life experienced such unprofessional service. We did not feel welcomed. We felt like a nuisance. I have 400 points in premier rewards so that alone can prove how often I'm in there giving them my money. The 2 new waiters we got were very nice and we wish we had them from the start. I honestly do not know if I'll ever be back and I am sad about it.

At this particular location, I really love the customer service of the bartenders, hosts, and the servers. They really lighten up the mood.  We ordered the lunch specials. My mother ordered the unlimited soup and salad for $6.95 and I ordered the Half Flatbread Pizza and Half Salad for $6.95. Both of these lunch special items are definitely a great deal. Unlimited soup and salad 4 stars ++Salad is like a house salad w/ iceburg lettuce, tomatos, croutons, etc with any choice of dressing. She ordered chicken tortilla for the first round and then a clam chower for the second. Chicken Tortilla is sooo yummy. How they serve the soup is pretty cool too. Order the dish and you will see what I mean. Clam chower was on the salty side so my mother had to pour some hot water to it. It may just be that most people eat their soups salty and we have sensitive tastebuds.... Margherita Fresca Flatbread Pizza and Salad 5 stars ++I can't believe this is only $6.95 at lunch. The margherita fresca flatbread pizza was soooo freakin good. The salad consisted of mixed green salad with a balsamic vinegrette dressing. Very well put together. Our server was pregnant but she was really good and attentive at her job. She was a trooper in making sure our food was great. Anyways I would definitely come back to BJ again whether it's for a drink, lunch, or dinner.

And I feel if there was a mixture of up beat Toni Braxton, Sade, type of music it would of been a perfect for a Friday night.I was recommended to this place for their pizza, and pizookie. Pizza I had was suppose to be deep dish. But to me from what I'm use to in Illinois the crust was mainly like a fluffy, airy, pop corn type of crust. Not criticising but it's not what I'm familiar with for a deep dish pizza. There was no tomatoe sauce or little to no cheese on our pizza. Idk if that's how pizza is made in California or what. On another note I will say the pizookie was to die for!!! I will definitely be back for another pizookie. And to try a thin crust pizza next time.

Ruben R.,"Palmdale, CA",88,66,21,1.0,5/1/2015,"I go to BJ's all the time, probably 2-3 times a month. Their service is not consistent at all and when they mess up they don't do anything to make up for it. I arrived with one other person and it took them about 10 minutes to take our order which is fine... But then we waited for an hour and a half to be served. The soda was flat, and so I asked to change it for another drink instead since it didn't taste right and they said they'd swap it out at no extra charge... then I was charged for both drinks at the end. The waiter came back every 20 minutes to let us know the food would be out any second, and that the reason it took so long was because they were just finishing up the salad... As if a salad takes so long to make, at least do not lie to us about why something is taking long. The 2 people next to us had a different waitress and they got there about 10 minutes after us, they ordered, ate, and paid their bill before we were even served. When they finally brought out our food, they forgot half of it. The salad was less than half the normal size, only about 4 bites worth, and they forgot all of our sides saying we didn't order any. I complained so they brought out my side of fruit, with nothing but watermelon and only half filled to the cup. They took back the salad and took another 20 minutes to bring it back fully filled. Another group of people next to us hadn't placed their orders after sitting their for over 30 minutes, and they had the same waiter. Of course the only tip I left was that the food tastes better when it's not served an hour and a half late, that and the extra money they charged me for the flat soda. I was going to wait until the waiter came back to pick up the bill, but after sitting there for 15 minutes waiting for him to come back I had to pay cash and left. Terrible service.

My husband's meal was comped two weeks in a row for excessive waiting. And when I say ""excessive"" I mean, eight people are practically done with their meals before he received his. Another person's sandwich was given the wrong bread and she waited, with her incorrect meal, several minutes until they brought her the correct bread. Why they didn't see fit to remove her plate and correct her sandwich so it would stay hot, I can't tell you.  This place is very busy and, while I have had no problems when we have been there as a couple, they do not seem able to accommodate a group - and this fact has been validated too numerous of times.  * * * * * * This is a chain restaurant so they have the corporate thing going: pleasant hosts ready to greet you the moment you walk in, wait staff always polite and knowledgeable, menu items always prepared the same. They can also split tabs which is a positive. They can get pretty busy (and loud) so you may have to wait, especially if you're with a group.

Mike E.,"Arlington, VA",153,34,129,4.0,2/15/2015,"My first time here at BJ. Food was ok wasn't anything spectacular. We ordered a small ultimate pepperoni deep dish pizza and spinach and artichoke dip.we also ordered a pazookie that took over 35-40 minutes for them to bring it to us. I didn't understand why it took so long... But other than that it was ok, not a 5 star restaurant tho 02/16/14 The manager Steve got in contact with me after my initial review and with that I had to change my rating!! He was very concerned about my issue and the fact that he read my review said a whole lot about him. He really cares about his customers. He apologized for my wait and explained why we had to wait so long for the pazookie.

So the cookie is served still warm and the ice cream starts to melt into it and it just ends up being this warm lump of sugary heaven. :)  I also love their avocado egg rolls. My husband loves the Parmesan chicken and the balsamic chicken.  I am part of their rewards program and they are very good about getting back to you when you have a problem.

They have a pretty good beer called Jeremiah Red, been getting it the last few visits and never disappoints, what did disappoint is that when asked about having a screen changed from a tv western show to actual sports (which were the prelims) my server Sara said no, we don't show any type of fights, I understand that may be policy but who would want to watch a western with no sound to a actual sporting event? I just think it was a small request that would have kept me buying more drinks and some food. It's a sports bar besides being a restaurant. This place and the yardhouse I find it kinda lame for providing half entertainment. As for Sara she did a great job asking if we were ok on drinks and would check up on us a few times. I just feel that the crowd isn't going to get rowdy if we see a few tackles and knockouts, and football is the same thing just MMA has less protection....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=120

If you want good pizza this is the place to be, however, the service is so unpredictable that it really is hard for me to give it the 4 or 5 star rating. I have had some very pleasant experiences here, hosts are almost always on the ball and courteous and servers are occasionally a lot of fun and a pleasure to be around.  Note that I said occasionally and not often.  We have had a few (3 to be exact) experiences that have left us to avoid this restaurant for the most part. Its just too unpredictable and a bad server, as we all know, can truly ruin your night.  1/3 of the time you will get bad service.

The onion strings were their usual yummy-ness as an appetizer, but the remainder of the meal left us both saying, ""Um, that didn't taste as great as I remembered it being last time."" We polished off the shared salad, but brought home most of the broccoli cheese soup; baby back pork ribs with baked potato; and the meatloaf with mashed potato and vegetables. Our theory is that we don't have to cook tomorrow, all we have to do is improve the leftovers a little bit and we'll be good to go.  (1) I'm heading to the freezer now to take out our homemade BBQ sauce to pour over the ribs before reheating tomorrow.  (2) I think I'll cut up the baked potato that has butter, sour cream and chives and just throw that into the soup pot when I pour in the too globby thick broccoli cheese soup ... add a little milk/cream to thin it down, a pinch of fresh nutmeg, a small amount of Romano cheese, a little sauteed shallots. It'll be great.  (3) I'll figure out the meatloaf, mashed potato and vegetable makeover on Monday :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=260
Faith K.,"Menifee, CA",37,3,,1.0,7/6/2016,"I have never written a Yelp review before but the horrible service has spurred me to action. The food was fine, BJs normally produces a consistent reliable product, but the service was horrible. Our server was Desiree G and we sat in the bar. She was slow which I could forgive but she was also short, blunt, and rude. After waiting ten or so minutes for our waters she took our order (not a big deal) the food came out 30 minutes later (still maybe not her fault it could be the kitchen). However, she was not the one to literally plop our food on the table and walk off with out so much a glance, she never came back to our table. Not once. She didn't refill our drinks ever, even though we attempted to make eye contact with her on the rare occasions we could see her. She also finally took our plates away, and without a word took away a plate I was still eating from while it was under my face, and there were three clearly empty plates at the end of the table for her to take. Then she ""split"" our check and was apparently too stupid to run two cards separately even though they were separated by the three way split bill. I have also never intentionally not tipped a waiter/waitress before since so many things are happening that us as customers are aware of but this was the most abhorrent service I have ever been subjected too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=260

Tyson S.,"Palmdale, CA",22,119,100,4.0,5/12/2014,"I gave an extra star for Rhonda S. By far the best and hardest working waitress we have seen in here. We come back because the good beer and 90% of the time the food is great. With lots of amazing low calorie options. However, we come early I'm assuming before the ""real"" manager comes in we are usually here between 3 and 5pm for an hour or 2. And what we see every time is tables begging for service and all the staff laughing and congregating in the corners by the POS systems and laughing watching videos on the cell phone and basically hanging out and having a good time while ignoring their tables. Once we even had the black haired ponytail tail waitress I see every time that works in the bar area serving tables arguing with me from across the room because she got our drink order wrong. We always carefully specifically order firestone double jack. And when the waitress sucks she brings a pint of firestone walker Union Jack not firestone double jack in a bottle we have had this twice the first time the lady apologized this chick argued with me telling me that's not what I said as if I ever order anything else. So anyways sign up for the rewards card so if they leave you stranded for 30 minutes with the bill you can just pay on your phone and go. Long story short your food should be great.

Justin A.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,49,4,4.0,7/19/2012,"I'm a huge fan of BJ's and it's style of being a gourmet restaurant, pub, and sports bar type of fusion all in one.  I love the great food and the excellent beers that they have, with the Nutty Brewnette being my favorite.  It's a large size restaurant with TVs all over showcasing various sporting events.  Places like that are immediate winners in my book.  The beer list is great and they'll have some good seasonal beers here and there. The food here is the real treat.  Any place that specializes in beer can't slack on appetizers and luckily BJ's got this memo.  The have a large and diverse menu that's filled with an assortment of great appetizers.  I recommend the Piranha Pale Ale Nachos though it's only an appetizer if you have 3 or more people.  It's probably going to be a meal for 1-2 people because of it's size.  A few of my other favorites that I order regularly are the Avocado Egg Rolls, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Santa Fe Spring Rolls.  In fact, I once order each one of the above mentioned appetizers, including the nachos on a first date.  I tried to impress by taking over and just ordering for us ""like a man"" and I wanted her to sample on some of my favorites from there.  Well... she was on a diet and ordered a salad... so I had a fridge full of delicious appetizers when I woke up the next day.  BJ's Chicago style pizzas are fantastic!  I've tried many different types and each ones that I've had has been great.  The awesome flakiness, crispiness, and buttery taste of the crust is something that will have you eagerly wanting to return to give them more of your money.  They're also well known for there very popular dessert, the BJ's Pizookie... and they're awesome!  They're cookies baked in their own individual deep dish pan, then topped with ice cream... nuff said, lol.  I'll actually stop by every once in awhile just for a Pizookie, yes, it's that good. BJ's also has a great mix of sandwiches, burgers, salads, pastas, giant stuffed potatoes, steaks, ribs, chef creations, and more.  I personally like the California Burger, Tuscan Chicken Limone, Fish & Chips ,Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich, Grilled Chicken Club, and of course the pizza!

I went a few months ago with my bf and we got a pitcher of one of their darker ales and a few random things on the menu.  I like the atmosphere inside and its a good place to watch the games with their many flat screen tvs. The servers were very friendly, we did make the mistake of looking at the calories for every item on the menu and MY GOD how do they have such high calorie items...it seriously puts to shame alot of the other chains that are notoriously bad for high calorie items. You can find a few things that are under 500 calories but hey if you go out to eat here you're not looking for something figure friendly.

So we all decided to go elsewhere. As we headed out a young man chased us out and asked us to please stay. I explained what happened and he offered everything he could and said we would only deal with him. We thought that was awesome of him to put himself out there like that so we decided to stay because of his customer service. His name was Cody he totally turned our experience around!! Now Cody has the personality and customer service that this restaurant needs. I'm sorry but that girl is going to make you lose customers not gain.

Bret R.,"Lancaster, CA",17,4,,5.0,6/4/2015,"I have been eating at BJ's ever since I first discovered the delights of their pizookies when they first opened their doors years ago. In all those years, I have almost always had exceptional, friendly, and quick service.  I rarely wait at all before being taken to a table and almost always have very prompt service. In the extremely rare cases that I have any problems whatsoever, the management team does an excellent and quick job of fixing whatever has gone wrong. To me, the true hallmark of a business that cares is not providing excellent service 100% of the time, a feat that is largely impossible, as everyone has a bad day, but in ensuring that problems are fixed and errors corrected.  I can say honestly and with great certainty that this particular restaurant has always done right by me, and I will continue to eat here for years to come. The employees and management staff truly care that you have a good experience and a good meal, and that is worth my business.

Then they forgot to assign us a waiter and we had to wait for 20 minutes before  we asked if someone was going to take our orders. Then the guy said he was not our waiter and we told him we don't have one. About an hour after being seated we got our food. Shortly after we asked for our check and she brought it within 10 minutes but took her over 15 minutes to come pick it up.

If that's what you're looking for, BJ's is definitely as a top pick.  The tricky thing -- the service. It was a-okay here. It was a little bit slow, but not so delayed that we were upset. It was Saturday night after all. The staff was really courteous, and these days, simple kindness goes a long way. A few staples: root beer floats, calamari, wings, bruschetta and nachos for starters. My personal faves: the seafood pasta and Cobb salad. The chowder, pot roast and pork chops score high with the fambam. Everything is large enough to share - including the pizookie. Our group includes two, sometimes 3, toddlers, a man-child, grammy and everyone in between.

They seated us, and we waited about five minutes till our waitress came to get our drink order. We ordered dinner when she brought our drinks about 10 minutes later. Then we sat there for about an hour before we got our food. Our waitress came by a few times and said the food was coming up soon. Finally our waitress said she knew we waited a long time so she would send the Manager over to our table to ""take care of us"". Well, he didn't take care of anything. He just came over and said the food would be out momentarily. Then he disappeared. Finally we got our food and we ate our meals. The food was fine. We were expecting our bill to have some kind of a discount for our long wait, but it didn't. We were very disappointed with this. The Manager just went back into the back and hid away! So, we just want everyone to know that BJ's is not about customer service and satisfaction. They are just about money. They weren't even very apologetic for making us wait so long.

The service was excellent can complain about that and the clam chowder I ordered was the best I ever had. However I tried the chicken jambalaya and it was one of the worst dishes I ever had. It tasted as if someone had dumped chili flakes all over the dish (apparent by the mess on the side of the plate with chili powder/flakes all over) so I made do with sharing fries and my clam chowder. My father in law specifically goes here for the mahi mahi tacos and he was disappointed because the fish was so burnt he couldn't even chew it and had to send it back, the second order was okay but a little under done.

My friend ordered the chicken tortilla soup and it took 25 minutes for just that to come out (and I know they just warm it up and pour it in the bowl). Disappointing. And to top it off, the waitress did not listen to me when I strategically numbered on the receipt what items I wanted on one card and numbered the other items for my friends card (in a 1,1,1,2,2,).

Erik H.,"Mission Hills, CA",410,37,17,3.0,8/23/2011,"""A fun menu and youthful staff make BJ's a popular stop in the Antelope Valley.""   I'm not a fan of big corporate chain restaurants. Akin to my days as a rebellious punk rawker, I still grow weary at the thought of 'Big Brother Inc.' plotting the demise of culinary culture, a conspiracy to dumb  down the human pallet so to feed us low quality produce and ingredients while maximizing profit. Down with the 'man'!!   BJ's is a popular corporate chain restaurant that is probably best known for their delectable brews and fun appetizers. The first time I tried BJ's Restaurant was in Santa Clarita, and I soon became a fan of the beer sampler and the avocado egg rolls. That was over 4 years ago now and I have returned a number of times to recapture the moment, all without fail.   I was pleased to learn of the construction of BJ's in Palmdale, as 1) Palmdale is my hometown. 2) I like BJ's Beers\Appetizers and 3) Palmdale (in the past) was in DESPERATE NEED of dining options.   My impression of BJ's facilities could literally be copied from site to site, as the Palmdale location offered all the familiar quirky, eclectic ambiance that the other locations offer; vintage signage and other memorabilia adorn the walls, offering diners something to look at as they wait for their dishes. Eye Fodder, but interesting fodder at that.   The Staff at Bj's is young and (for the most part) inexperienced. This isn't a knock, only an observation. Corporate restaurants often hire servers with little or no experience for a number of good reasons, this shouldn't imply that the service is bad, just 'inexperienced'. The service I received at BJ's was friendly, unpretentious, and best-effort. The staff was clean cut, and attentive to my table. (I did notice a high ratio of Female servers to Male, just sayin').   The food at BJ's occupies a middle ground; The establishment isn't 'pub-ish' enough to be considered 'Pub Grub', and is not refined enough to be considered 'Fine Dining', yet it posses strong traits of both. It's a popular middle ground that is occupied by many of the new-up restaurants trying to capture the 20-30 yo. crowd for drinks and fun times. I like that business model :)   Aiming to capture the burgeoning college age (and beyond) market, their menu reflects it by supplying ample doses of pub friendly appetizers like Sliders, Poke, those Avocado Egg Rolls I like so much, and Calamari for Grandma (Sorry Calamari fans..lol). The entree menu is fairly extensive and runs a spectrum, from Pizza and Pasta to Burgers, salmon, pork chops and ribs.    The quality of the ingredients is typical with most corporate owned establishments. My Salmon and Egg Rolls were fresh and tasty, but I noticed wilting endive in our salads. This lack of attention to detail to me is a sign of one of two things: 1) Busy Kitchen or 2) Cook staff that doesn't care. I will safely say that number 2 was not the culprit, as BJ's tends to be quite busy as others have mentioned, and the attention shown in our dishes testified highly on the competency of the cook staff. The Angel Hair Toscana that my daughter ordered was prepared fresh. The taste of the  fresh tomatoes and Basil came through, indicating the produce problems might have been isolated to the endive salad.    Bj's is also budget friendly, as daily specials and menu pricing won't hurt dad's wallet, and ladies, your boo can still afford to take you to the movies afterward. For a family of four, we escaped at a little over $50 with tip (no alcohol). Overall, the experience was a pleasant one, was it 'memorable', no, not in the traditional dining sense, but when driving through the Antelope Valley will I remember that BJ's is an option for satisfying bites and brews? You betcha.  In a place that I once considered a desolate wasteland for foodies (the Antelope Valley) , lights of hope peer through the desert night sky and illuminate a land that is slowly gaining it's foothold on food culture. Sure BJ's is corporate, but much like trickle down economics, the construction of BJ's in the AV indicates a need. A need for fun, memorable dining experiences, a need for 'better' food choices and culinary diversity. And though there have been small diners and restaurants in the AV for years that deserve mention, none are such a beacon of change as BJ's. Soon, the question for foodies in the AV won't be ""Where do we go? There's so few choices"", to ""Where do we go? I can't make up my mind!"", inspiring diners to get out and have fun and spend $$$!!!  FOODIE UP!!!! Erik",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=300

Anyhow this time I came on a busy night which is rare. Then again I acme on Nov 11th Veterans Day. I seated myself in the bar area since the hostess recommended it. The waitresses were zooming all over the place to take care of seated customers so there was about 15 minutes before I was offered a menu. My waitress was nice and pleasant even with the number of tables she had. In all it was a good experience. The only thing is trying to get someone's attention. Yelling excuse me or waving trying to get the wait staff attention is in a way rude since everyone doesn't have the same tolerance for service. The wait staff should wear name tags...even when they introduce themselves and say ""I will be taken your order tonight"" I'm one to have to hear the name several times before I can form an identity. In short it would be a better experience if they wore name tags. I know how some may feel about strangers knowing their names.

Sandie C.,"Lancaster, CA",8,61,3,3.0,1/1/2012,"I've enjoyed coming into this restaurant but I have to say that the service yesterday was not the norm. We met friends here for a late New Years Eve lunch.  We arrived at the restaurant at 3pm and were seated immediately.  A little while after we were seated, the wait staff took our drinks and appetizer order, brought the drinks and promptly disappeared for the next 45 minutes.  Meanwhile, the table that was seated after us received their salads promptly while we sat and waited for our waitress to return with our food.  After 45 minutes, she arrived at the table with a mute guy from the kitchen with our appetizers AND the entrees.  I requested that the entrees go back to the kitchen while we ate the entrees and her response was: ""They'll just go under the heat lamps.""  To dry out?  No thanks.  We took all the food at the table at the same time and, by the time the salads were eaten, the entrees were half cold. I wasn't so mad at the fact that the food all came out at once as I was about the waitress's attitude.  In fact, she made me bloody furious.  I came thisclose to getting into an argument but I wasn't about to stoop to that level.  Anyway, after a time, I guess she realized that we were not happy about having been ignored for so long and then having all that food dumped on us at once and so she informed the manager about the situation without me having to.  The manager was very friendly and helpful and took care of the salads and desserts and charged us only for the entrees and drinks.  I appreciated the fact that the waitress took responsibility, although she blamed the guys in the back for not bringing out the salads promptly.  Honey, it's your job to check on your tables to make sure everyone has their food in a timely manner.  After all, BJs is not cheap.  If someone has $100 to spend on lunch, there are plenty of other corporate chain restaurants to go to in Palmdale and Lancaster. Anyway, the fact that the manager took care of our tab in a professional manner means that I will return to BJs.  The food is good and I have no complaint otherwise.  Next time I'll know to flag down any member of staff when I have been sitting at the table for a while without food although the last thing I want to do when I go out to eat with friends or family is to create bad feeling with the wait staff. Given the interior decor, ambience, my personal experience so far with the food and the menu, for a casual restaurant this should really be 4 to 5 star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=340

Chris B.,"Edwards, CA",0,28,1,1.0,6/11/2012,"Had a pretty terrible experience here for lunch...  We ordered the kids food first, which came out promptly, in fact as we were ordering for the rest of the party.  Initial reflections were positive.  After that it was a mess.  After ordering (and asking for spoons for the kids' apple sauce), it was 20 minutes before we were checked in on again... To bring out salads, and still no spoons.  15 minutes after that, soups came out for those that ordered the soup and salad, and those in our party who had ordered sandwiches asked on that status to which the waitress replied ""oh they're plating them now.""  25 minutes later, after everyone had eaten there were still no sandwiches, and the waitress responed ""well the soup and salad are really quick, but we know, they're cooking them now.""  From plating to cooking, then.  Well, it sounds like we were lied to.  Finally 10 minutes later the manager came out to say that he was sorry and that the sandwiches would be free.  Ok, great, so they're doing the right thing at least.  Well 15 minutes after that, the kids are getting restless and still no sandwiches.  Sandwiches. So I guess if they're going to give you something free, you get put to the bottom of the priority list.  Meanwhile, people are hungry and kids are getting even more restless to the point where I finally decide that we're leaving.  As we're beginning to get up, the manager walks out with two sandwiches. Me: It's too late, we have to go. Mgr: Do you want a box? Me: Well, at this point not really, it's kind of too late. Mgr (miffed): Well, um ok.  I uhh was going to give you some courtesy cards. Me: Well you haven't really inspired enough confidence in me to want to come back, now have you?   Mgr (really miffed): *makes several excuses about how the kitchen was busy (restaurant was half full) and the food got sold to another table... huh?* If the management reads this forum, I hope they understand that making excuses doesn't make things better.  At last gave me two gift cards (total $40) to pay for my $34 meal.  The fact that he charged me for this lovely 1.5 hour lunch experience in the first place is a FOUL.  Then he swiped the gift cards and didn't even give me one back for the remaining balance.  Professional.  I guess either he knew he screwed the pooch or he only begrudgingly compensated me $40 (minus $6).  I ultimately don't care because I wouldn't ever go back here, but the actions of the staff and the manager were inexcusable.  The answer is ""I am sorry and I'll make this right.""  My preferred method is to speak softly and carry a small tip in cases like these but when it got beyond ridiculous, I spoke up and got a barrage of excuses and looks like I was trying to scam this restaurant.  Well, I think I'll take my business elsewhere next time.  I heard good things about this Steve Huddleston guy on other reviews, and I don't think it was he who I dealt with today... but I wonder what kind of place he's running if his staff can't execute simple lunch service and treat their guests poorly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=320

And the Asian chicken lettuce wraps are my favorite lowish carb meal. Their pizza comes served in a dish, deep dish style, with tomatoes on top of it. I like the Great White because it has white sauce garlic, chicken and mushrooms. The micro brews are great. Our waitress was very attentive, I didn't have to wait at all for a drink refill.. something that has happened here before.

Brian U.,"Sylmar, CA",0,1596,100,2.0,4/3/2010,"After I received my first hate e-mail on Yelp, I thought I'd better hide my real face. I replaced it with a sea urchin. Not only because I love sea urchin, but I'm also all prickly on the outside and salty on the inside. I hope my anti-fan approves of such a self-portrait. Now on to spreading my unhappy hatred on another victim. I first went to a BJ's restaurant ages ago in Maui with the hope of getting their namesake Chicago-style pizza. This is NOT the place to get authentic deep dish pie. It's also not a good place get a cocktail unless you're a fan of sweet, Jello-tasting drinks. And even though it's called BJ's, they don't serve them. Over the years, they have expanded the menu so it's half-pizzeria and half-diner so the menu is enormous. Perplexed with so many choices and prior visits telling me what not to eat, what do I try this time that might bring me some food joy? With no logical rationale, I rolled the dice on the fish and chips. I came up a winner! The fish had a nice puffy batter coating and the fish was moist. My girlfriend ordered the lettuce wraps which had an overwhelming amount of salt. If you don't believe me, check the sodium content in the nutritional chart on the back of the menu. As food establishments go, BJ's are exceptionally well managed and always seem busy without costly advertising. Hmmm. Maybe, I should think about investing in a BJ's franchise? Naw, I'm too thin-skinned (literally) to take the abuse of customers and mean Yelper's like me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=320
Arthur S.,"Long Beach, CA",15,72,3,1.0,3/29/2012,I will make this short and to the point I ordered a pizza I wanted half pineapple and half pepperoni.  When I got my bill it charged me for what i ordered but also for tomatoes as a topping.  The pizza did have tomatoes on it but it was never ordered by us.  Instead of just taking the topping off and letting me happily pay and tip they told me that because I split a topping I had to pay for 2 toppings.  I have worked in many pizza places in my day and that is just some bull.  They got the manager and the manager told me the same thing.  Train your people on what customer service is I was a loyal customer but over them charging me for an extra topping I will never visit that branch again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=320

Food is usually good but nothing spectacular.  The appetizer sampler had become our must-order thing not because of the taste but because of a few pieces of this and a few pieces of that.   In particular, I love the artichoke dip.

The food if very good for a casual dining/sports bar type of place.  I like that there are cloth napkins and heavy duty silverware.  It seems the owners pay attention to the details.   If I could make their California burger at home, I'd never leave.  Sour dough slices on the griddle, the tenderest hamburger ever, green chiles, avocado, pepper jack cheese, chipolte mayo AND ranch dressing all subtly blend together in a melt in you mouth comfort food burger unlike any other burger.  The shrimp dishes are great cause the shrimp is so tender and flavorful.  The coffee is good.  I haven't had everything on the menu but it seems as though each item I've had has been given special attention so that it's not run of the mill.   The prices are very reasonable compared to Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Famous Dave's all on restaurant row too but not as good.   The service is always friendly and appearing to be enjoying their work, even the busboys look like they're having fun.   All in all, a great casual yet well done place. I recommend it for brunch on the weekends although the menu is limited, lunch and dinner.   I suspect that people who complain too harshly about the service have 'service problems' wherever they go.  I know people like that and it's a pain to go out to dinner with them. We used to joke about one gal who would practically order 1 egg scrambled and the other over easy, and want to substitute this and that and I would feel so sorry for the server. And, it they couldn't do what she asked, she would start all over with a different selection.  I think those marks on her neck were from waitresses trying to strangle her during previous visits.

The revolving door going into the place starts off the experience on a good note, and once inside, it's like an emporium, with the huge bar and bar seating area to the right, and the step-up booths and 'normal' tables on the left.  It's relaxing even with the high-energy atmosphere, and the food is more than passable. The drinks are ok, not top-flight.  They use terrible olives in the martinis - as a drink I recommend either beer, Aussie wine or the Tangueray  Perfect No. 10, pure gin with a lime wedge - - NOT a twist, as they describe on the menu; this place is not really attentive to the little details.    In fact, the first two times we were there, they got our order wrong.  We came back a third time because I still thought the place had potential.   The fries are the best thing on the menu, I think - they're thick and crunchy, coated with this really good seasoning, a winner hands down.  Also good is the THIN CRUST sausage/basil appetizer pizza; you could easily have two of those as a main course and leave a happy camper.  I'm from NYC (as I keep writing, blah blah blah) and I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza although I did try it the first time we came here and I rest my case. Don't recommend it.  What I do suggest most hardily is the wedge salad ~ this rocks, plain and simple, a winning combo of tastes that I make at home now every time I can find a decent iceberg lettuce at a supermarket (easier said than done, these days).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=380

Dania R.,"Rosamond, CA",59,248,76,4.0,8/18/2012,"I hate chain food.  But I love the multitude of menu options that make this an easy place to dine Paleo in the AV.  The salad menu is fabulous.  My most recent experience involved the thai mango salad which came out with bright fresh pieces of produce... and although the salad was initially missing the grilled chicken, the problem was QUICKLY ameliorated by our server.  There are ""chapters"" of options for meat and veggies.  I've been pleasantly satisfied with the service during each visit.  On non-strict Paleo days, I love the massive selection of beers and have yet to be disappointed.  BJ's is probably the only chain near the mall that I will go to.  The other options have yet to be satisfactory in the food quality and atmosphere department.  I do love that BJ's has screens in almost every direction for watching games that I don't get at home and when my husband and I don't feel like conversing while we're eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=360
Michael L.,"Navy Yard, Washington, DC",16,33,5,4.0,8/13/2008,"MAINSTREAM, but still good.   Compared to other BJ's and considering the lack of alternatives in the AV I gave ours no more than 4 stars. In my heart, you really can't mess up a brewhouse. Micro-brewed beers and Belgium's brews are my favorite drinks to explore and BJ's just happens to provide some of the ones I've already chosen to indulge in (wherever available). They don't have as big of a selection as true Brewhouses, but for a family-friendly restaurant they've done a good job.    They have good pizza, food (I assume) and appetizers. You won't find me rating too much on the food here since I'm a semi(?)-vegetarian. I go for the beer and atmosphere.  BJ's floor has two levels and somewhat of a partition that has a good balance in separating the bar area from the dining.  The staff, for the most part, is efficient and friendly. If or when you do encounter that one who is not so friendly and/or efficient, accept that life happens. No establishment can keep 100% customer satisfaction and pampering, even if they tried.   Overall I think BJ's has been good enough to me to make it my go-to place for drinks and merriment if I do choose to stay within the desolate gates of the Antelope Valley.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=360
Carla T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,7,,3.0,10/4/2013,Food is good. Prices are reasonable. Manager is a really good person. We went there on last Sunday. There was a long wait.

Aaron M.,"Indianapolis, IN",78,108,153,5.0,2/26/2010,First time I've eaten at a BJ's. Now I see what the fuss is about. Food is really great and the beers are fantastic.

Adam D.,"Palmdale, CA",81,15,1,1.0,11/9/2014,"Have not been here in 3 years and will never visit here again. Worst experience ive ever had in a restaurant ever. First we had a bigger group of people with us maybe about 10 people and we waited 4 hours yes 4 hours just to sit down with no appolagies or anything. If this was not my brother in laws birthday I would of walked out hours earlier.  Once we sat down it was 10pm remember we arrived at 6pm. We ordered are food without too many issues. When we went to pay they split the checks up. I was very cautious only spending around 15$ due to my bank account being pretty low. They ended up charging 5 peoples bills to my card racking up around 120$ bill. I tried to explain to them that i was now negative in my bank account and they brushed it off and told me it wasnt a big deal. I told the waitress what i was trying to explain and she BLEW up on me screaming at me telling me ""i dont know how hard her job is!"" I stood there speechless about what had just happend. She called security to escort me out of the restaurant. The manager knowing i did nothing wrong came out and talked with me about my debit card but wouldnt address the fact that his waitress just screemed in my face and kicked me out. I love bjs but after that incident my entire family all refuses to visit this horrible restaurant. You lost around 20 big customers you will never get back due to not simply apologizing to me...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-palmdale-2?start=360
