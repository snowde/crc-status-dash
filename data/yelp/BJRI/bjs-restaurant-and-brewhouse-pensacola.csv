Marianne K.,"Pensacola, FL",66,33,12,3.0,4/25/2016,Service wasn't the greatest but it could be because it just opened. The server seemed very distracted and didn't even look at us. But again that could be because it was opening brand-new. The food was delicious,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40
Bob P.,"Pensacola, FL",14,6,,2.0,7/23/2017,"I would have given the place a better review, however, @$6.50 a beer they get knocked down a star and a half.  The menu was pretty good with lots of choices, almost too many.  We have found that when you have too many choices, the food begins to taste the same no matter what you get. The portions are good and the calorie count HIGH.  I had the Ziti and it was 1400 calories.  I don't normally look at calorie count, but when it's posted, Yeah, I look.   I give it a $$ for food and $$$ for beer and wine.  The place get 3.5 stars for roominess and atmosphere.  A lively sports bar kind of setting with a long bar and lots of sitting area within the bar area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40
Dennis D.,"Pensacola, FL",0,13,41,3.0,9/19/2016,"This is one of my favorite restaurants, but on this visit, I was disappointed in the service we received. My wife and her cousin from Japan ordered pizza, while I got a sandwich with fries and a Ceaser salad. Never got the salad, no ketchup for the fries. Everyone's drinks were empty half way through the meal, no refills, no waitress. Not the level of service I've come to expect. And to make matters worse, this was the very first stop after leaving the airport with our Japanese guest. I was embarrassed, as this was her first trip to America.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40
Jennifer W.,"Milford, DE",82,3,6,2.0,1/9/2017,"The service was wonderful, and that's about where it ended. The food was lackluster and boring, even for a chain.  The drinks were terrible.  Their top shelf Margarita was a joke.  If you're looking for nice service, good atmosphere and good beer, it's a nice place.  If you're looking for good food and a nice cocktail, this isn't the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40
Matthew S.,"Mobile, AL",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2017,Over priced tgifridays. The food is ok at best. The management is clueless. Also the root beer is non alcoholic so don't let that fool you. The only reason I would recommend this place is to complain about the meal and get it free.

Shawn F.,"Miramar Beach, FL",30,24,15,3.0,7/3/2016,"Impressive atmosphere. Seems like it's still trying to get some legs under it but has potential. Was overwhelmed by the huge menu.

Tiff C.,"Pensacola, FL",193,489,3224,4.0,7/25/2016,"So this is my 3rd time eating here and I must say I really like this place. We went yesterday on a Sunday afternoon, although there was only a 15 minute wait we decided to eat at the bar since we saw a few chairs open. Marissa the bartender was super cool and made the best Alabama Sunset(yes that's a real drink in the south) I've ever tasted. My bf had one of his weird beers he likes to drink(don't know the names of any of them) and we both had sandwiches for lunch. I had the California Chicken Club which consisted of Applewood smoked bacon, avocado, melted swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and roasted garlic aioli on grilled sourdough bread. When I say it was good, I mean this sandwich was GOOOOOOD!! The skinny fries were nicely seasoned and all and all a nice lunch. Sometimes I hate eating at  a bar  in a restaurant  but for some reason the setup here at BJ's makes it not seem weird or annoying being that close to other creatures. Make sure you use your Yelp App as you get either a free appetizer or a free pizookie.. We got the free pizookie of course! This place is starting to become my favorite 9th Ave spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40

James D.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",0,34,,4.0,5/3/2017,Recently ate at BJs with the whole family.  Service was excellent.  We had a bunch of entrees and everyone seemed to enjoy them.  I had the full rack of ribs with pepper bbq sauce.  Pretty darn good.  Best part was that salad and soup were included with no extra charge as southern sides.  The other entrees of note were the burgers and rootbeer wings.  My daughter loved them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40

Rick B.,"Pensacola, FL",1,23,,4.0,6/6/2016,"First time there on a not busy Monday evening. Waiter was very attentive, appeared moments after we were seated checking on drinks. They have a very extensive beer list including some brewed in their own brewery in Texas. I had a nut brown ale, which was well done. My guest had a amber which was OK.  Allen stopped by a couple times while we were perusing the 13 page menus. It had the beers, and wines as well as food.  They have a few appetizers and soups, two different pizzas, thin and deep dish. Burgers, sandwiches, salads, steaks, pasta and deserts. Oh yea and quinoa bowls, and a kale / Brussels sprout salad. There has to be something for every one there.  We had the thin crust tomato basil mozzarella pizza for $13. I wasn't sure it would be enough for two so ordered a  hickory BBQ burger with BBQ pork and bacon and a meat patty. It came with shoestring fries, again about $13.  The pizza was tasty and plenty for two, the frys were crisp and not oily. We ate those two and brought the burger home. Dinner with tax was $40 and we over ordered.  Nice place, not too noisy, decent food. Lots of TVs with sports.  I'll go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40
Des D.,"Pensacola, FL",0,25,23,4.0,6/6/2016,"This restaurant deserves a decent review.  I've read about BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse, mostly on the National Restaurant Association's website, and mostly concerning their financial success. Because I've never seen one, or heard much about it, I haven't given it much thought. Having been there now I must say I am impressed. This is a very nice place. It has a modern, upscale, gastro pub/sports bar environment. I didn't see any children, and honestly it's not a place for children. There is a children's menu and I'm sure they are welcome, but right off the top it looks and feels like an adult establishment. We went on Sunday night at 6:00. The parking lot was full and I assumed there would be a wait, but I had no idea how large this place was inside and we were seated immediately. (There was a wait line when we left.) There are tables, high tables, and booths. The very first thing you notice when you come in is the bar. It's massive, and the colorful lighting is beautifully striking. The back wall is covered with their beer offerings. If you are a beer connoisseur there's enough to keep you busy for days. BJ's has their own handcrafted beers, there are locally crafted beers, there are micro brews, there are seasonal beers, flavored beers, and quite a variety of German ales, stouts, blondes, etc. When you are seated they hand you a menu which looks like overnight reading material. The first 6 pages are all alcohol related. They serve everything. From a wide variety of appetizers, to steaks,  pasta,  seafood, ribs, sandwiches and burgers, you will find something to eat today, and want to try several more items on future visits. The food is nicely executed and impressive. There's no doubt that you are in a 2016 restaurant that keeps up with the trends. In 1978 BJ's was originally a pizza restaurant in Orange County, CA. so it's no surprise that the menu includes an entire pizza section. They specialize in Chicago style pizza. We didn't get the pizza, but saw a lot of it coming out of the kitchen, and it's something to try next time- maybe a small one as an appetizer.  The prices are reasonable, rivaling chain restaurants like Applebee's and Chili's, but slightly more costly. Personally I thought the quality of the food is much better and worth the price.  Do not go expecting an inexpensive meal, but it's not going to break your wallet unless you're adding alcohol to the bill. This BJ's location has been open since April. That has given them 2 months to work out their opening kinks. The restaurant was busy and bustling and runners were continuously taking food out of the kitchen. There seems to be no shortage of staff. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu, and offered suggestions and favorites. She was also very busy, so when my adult son's food came out and ours didn't until 12 minutes later there was no one to tell. My server is my liaison with the kitchen. If there's a problem I can't go in and ask, ""Where's my order?"" I rely on her to do that. When she did show up she went to check on it, then told us she was looking for the manager, but couldn't find her. Like I said, the restaurant is very big and very busy so I wasn't surprised, but I did want this resolved quickly. I had ordered the pasta with jumbo meatballs, which was awesome, but not hot. Luckily, I like my pasta more warm than hot, however it should have been run to the table much, much sooner. Still my meal was wonderful. It was not Italian restaurant pasta, it was bistro- style with meatballs that were huge, handmade, and delicious. There was enough to eat, and plenty left over to take home. I would certainly order it again. My husband ordered the fried jalapeno burger and said it was good. My son's brisket burger was beautiful. I tried some of the smoked brisket on top and it was smokey, peppery, and delicious. Aside from the glitch with our order we had a very nice experience. I don't think we can expect the crowds to die down here. At this location I believe this is going to be a popular place in Pensacola. To minimize the wait there is a BJ's app. with"" Preferred  Wait."" I didn't use it so I don't know much about it, but it's worth testing. We will go back, there are lots and lots of menu items I would like to try. The steak and ribs looks amazing, and the monkey bread with ice cream will have to wait.  Oh, and they did take my meal off the price of the ticket.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40

First of all, BJs has a fantastic menu, from the wide variety of food to the eclectic choice of beers. Everything is wonderful. But Justin takes the cake. He is absolutely precious. He made our experience one of a kind. He made my mom feel very special for her birthday and gave us very personable service. I will ask for him every time I visit from now on.

Emily F.,"Pensacola, FL",98,51,8,2.0,4/21/2016,I have been to BJs in other cities. So we were excited to finally have one here. We decided to go on Wednesday April 20th at 7:30pm. We used the app to check in on the wait list before we got to the restaurant. On the app it said there were tables open with no wait. When we arrived we were told we were checked in and it would be a few minutes. We ended up waiting for a table for 45 minutes. After 20 minutes I asked the hostess how much longer it would be and was told 10 minutes. When I asked why I was told it would only be a few minutes they shrugged and walked away. There was a woman wearing a suit type jacket with several pins who was obviously the trainer since it is opening week. She was very rude. If she is the one training the hostesses I don't have much hope for them.  Once we were finally seated the service was very slow. I know it's opening week so I tried to be open minded. But I had to ask for a refill three times and extra sauce twice.  We are loyalty members and we were never asked for our loyalty member number. I had to flag down the woman training our waitress to get her to add our loyalty number to our table.  Everything we ordered was great. Pizzas and burgers. Of course the pizookies were the best part.  Overall the food was good. But the experience was horrible. Maybe they'll get it together after a few weeks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40
Chanda O.,"Lafayette, LA",100,37,,5.0,5/17/2016,"I have been to several BJs restaurants. The service has always been terrific! Tonight was no exception! Natalie G is terrific. Your menu is huge. I always have a tough time deciding. I didn't want eat too much because I wanted to leave room for dessert. Natalie G suggested an appetizer, (calamari). That's what I had! I had a pizzookie for dessert! The service was great. I did not feel rushed, but I also didn't want to sit around forever either. I will definitely be back. I will also recommend her and BJ's to friends!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40
Rick H.,"Pensacola, FL",0,6,,4.0,5/15/2016,"Not sure why so much hate in the other reviews.  We've been twice since they've opened about a month ago.  This place is still ""settling in"" (you can tell the wait staff is still tense and being broken in). You will want to be patient because of the hype of a new restaurant in town.  As for the food, the deep dish pizza is great.  Their in house brews are pretty good (the jeremiah red is strong as hell).  I would highly recommend locals or folks visiting mutliple times to download the bj's app to avoid wait times. You can log into the app and get on the wait list from home! In short, it's a decent chain restaurant witu good brews and a huge menu but be patient when randomly showing up there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=40
Lorri D.,"Dallas, TX",52,123,251,3.0,6/26/2016,"First impression - They're newly opened and aren't yet operating as A CRAFT team. I sat at the bar since I was alone and ordered my ole' favorite Hopstorm (so glad it's here now). Yes it took a few minutes to receive service, but that is to be expected by a new staff, although the bar was only half full.  As I sat drinking my lovely craft beer I happened to be right in front of the POS and watching Crystal try to operate it gave me anxiety!!

Pete K.,"Milton, FL",17,11,1,5.0,5/14/2016,"I love bar food. Greasy wings, cheese sticks and urine colored American beer.  If that is what you want, don't go to BJ's.  I had the grilled Ahi salad and I am not going to lie, best salad ever.  The sesame-ginger salad dressing set it off. Here is the thing, servers moved quick, they were well organized and skilled in team work. My waitress(don't they still call them that?) was as beautiful as she was motivated. overall a great experience.  I am definitely going back for their honest to goodness deep dish pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=20
Gus E.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",27,116,17,5.0,4/1/2017,Pretty good vibes. Huge bar. Mushrooms were amazing. Had the blackened salmon and the wife had the spaghetti. Very tasty and filling.  Great waitress. Will be back!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=20
Ryan B.,"Pensacola, FL",96,17,16,3.0,10/31/2016,"BJ's has the right idea. The beers are actually, quite good for a chain restaurant. Their menu has plenty of options to choose from and every time I come the food is delicious. I've tried a few of the appetizers, including the avocado egg rolls and chicken pot stickers; both very good. For my main dish I've had the Cobb salad, flat bread pizza, and tonight I had the Jambalaya, on the recommendation of my server. All very good. However; I was a little uneasy about the price of the jambalaya. How corporate can justify 17.00 for chicken, andouille sausage, rice, and seasoning, is far beyond me.     My next issue, which again is at the corporate level, is the floor plan. Well, what does that have to do with a Yelp review? Wait times. Service is so slow because the bar and kitchen are so far away, from over half of the seating area. If your server has over 2 tables, expect very slow service. That is a lot of walking back and forth for them to do; so I try to keep that in mind when I'm there.     All in all, great food, good beer, decent service. I'd recommend BJ's to Pensacola residents; if you're visiting from out of town, find a smaller local restaurant with less wait times and a more unique dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=20

Nadia S.,"Livonia, LA",0,3,,5.0,6/30/2017,Great Restaurant with a wide variety of foods and drinks. The lighting sets the mood and it's exceptionally clean. Management is on top of things! Some waiters are more observant than others. One guy named Raymond is a really good waiter!

Toya C.,"Pensacola, FL",3,319,1742,3.0,1/29/2017,"The hubby wanted to try this place out so we did.   We were greeted and seated immediately.   Our waitress was nice but sparse throughout the meal.  I had found this deal for baby back rib Thursdays which offered the meal and a free mini pizooki.  So I got that and it came with a salad as well.  The hubby ordered pot stickers for appetizer and a chicken dinner.  The little one got grilled cheese and fries meal.  I did not like the pot stickers they were doughy and tasted undone.  The hubby never got his drink until the meal was served because we never saw our server until then after she dropped off the appetizer and salad.  The salad was really good and fresh and cool.  My dinner was okay.  I got ribs, rice pilaf and broccoli.  The ribs were the best part of the meal.  The rice pilaf was dry and tasteless.  The broccoli had some weird seasoning that the hubby and I both didn't like.  The litttle ones meal was good though.  We ended up eating some of her fries - lol. I did get the free pizooki and that was the best part of the meal.  I got the cookies and cream one.  It's a small pan with the warm baked cookie and a scoop of ice cream.  It was delicious and a nice way to end a fairly boring meal.  The hubby ended up getting the trio dessert meal and he got the regular chocolate chip pizooki, monkey bread and oreo.  He enjoyed the flavors of them all.  Overall the food was subpar.  The dessert was the star of the meal.

Thomas C.,"Jacksonville, FL",24,58,1,4.0,6/11/2016,"I generally don't enjoy chain restaurants. They're stale and unenjoyable experiences that make you wish you had stayed at home.  BJ's flies in the face of that feeling. It's a vibrant and open restaurant with a nice menu, good food and a cool atmosphere that is enjoyable.  At the time of this writing the restaurant is still fairly new to the area only being open a couple months. I imagine they're starting to iron out some of the opening problems that other reviewers mentioned as I didn't experience any of them.  We were seated quickly and our waitress was attentive throughout the meal. We had fried asparagus that had a nice flavor and kept its crisp bite after cooking. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. Not a dish I normally order anywhere, but I was feeling froggy and jumped. It was really nice and actually had a good little bit of heat. My wife had a seared tuna salad and enjoyed it.

If you are going to take the time to go get ketchup for your table at least make sure it's full when you bring it to the table.

Phil A.,"Milton, FL",4,63,146,5.0,5/22/2016,"I can't stand reading people's reviews on chain restaurants.. Especially when the restaurant is actually really good and doesn't deserve a poor review. Reading through these comments I saw a ""grown man"" who gave a 2 star review because he didn't like that they had a revolving door.. 1. If $14 is an expensive meal to you, please stay home or go to Mcdonalds. 2. You can't say in a review how you realize they just opened yet your upset that they are busy or fine tuning some aspects of their business.. Off my soap box.  The ACTUAL review: My wife and I used to love going to BJ's back in the DC area, and were so excited when we heard they were opening up a BJ's down here! We have so far gone to this new BJ's twice, both times during peak hour, and the wait times were not anything more than to be expected. The staff were always very friendly, and admittedly, for how many tables our waitress had the last time we were there, my wife and I were surprised she even attempted to chat with us!  The calamari was cooked very well and the seasonings were very good. Whenever I go without my wife I get the Avocado egg roles (wife is allergic to avocado, what a shitty thing to be allergic to?) if you have never tried them, I HIGHLY recommend them! We also ordered their ""hard"" root beer which was very tasty! My wife and I both order their Deep dish pizza every time we go and like to try different ones; we haven't found one yet we can honestly say we didn't like. The BJ's Classic is an everything pizza which is always fantastic, and the Mediterranean is great if you enjoy olives, artichoke, feta, etc! My wife and I rarely, if ever, order dessert at a restaurant, but I definitely recommend trying a pazookie (how you pronounce that silly word, I have no clue.) If you can't decide on one flavor you can always just get the trio and try three different flavors!  The prices aren't over the top, but apparently people in this area find a $13 meal to be outrageous..? If this is truly outrageous you can always get their coupons on your phone for $10 off or half off pizza on Mondays Etc.. If you don't want a wait, don't go during peak hours..? Common sense things here people.. But, if you don't like a restaurant that has a revolving door and you want to cry about it, you probably just suck as a human being in general.. BJ's has great food, an AMAZING selection, and a great drink selection as well! Definitely recommend you trying it out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=20

We also asked for ranch to put on top but honestly the dish wasn't worth $5. The beef was kinda dry but it was ok; it also came with the shrimps dipped in the cheese but we couldn't eat all.

James B.,"San Diego, CA",3,19,4,2.0,5/6/2016,"So I arrived at the establishment on a Friday evening and placed my name on the waiting list for a party of 2. 40 min wait, cool. The hostess mentioned that I could grab a beer while I wait so I did. Ordered a beer from the bar, asked the bartender if I could take it outside and her response was ""you're not supposed to but it's okay"".. Well apparently it's not ""okay"" because one of the staff members told me I can't have my beer outside after I was already outside drinking my beer (keep in mind the lobby is packed with people). If it's not ""okay"" then your BARTENDER should not tell people it is. Got seated, the waitress didn't know much about the menu from the two questions I asked. Ordered a ""queso dip and chips"" with equated to warmed up velveeta cheese with some chopped up tomatoes on top. The cheese tip at Taco Bell is better. Don't recommend. The food arrived within a reasonable time considering how busy the place was. One side item was left off of one dish because they ran out of the item, but it was replaced with a new one. Portions were average, food flavor was bland, and temperature of food was warm. Overall, it was an ""ehhh"" experience. For $38 for two people (two entrees, a beer, and app) I wouldn't recommend. Nothing great, and definitely nothing waiting 30+ minutes for. I probably won't be going back with so many other better options around the same area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola?start=60

Bar drink order took much longer.  Once all the drinks were empty he came back by and asked if we wanted more. The food arrived and again the bar drinks were slow. Waiter came by once we received the food and asked if we needed anything.   I just asked for the drinks. He left our table and walked over to another table where he stood and talked while we went without drinks.  I walked up to the bar myself and picked up the drinks that had been sitting on the counter waiting on him.  One of my party's dinner was delivered to the table in a takeout box.  Why is that?

Kristi W.,"Pensacola, FL",1,16,1,4.0,7/16/2016,"So I absolutely love this restaurant, we've been several times and never had a bad dish. I've been getting the gluten free pizza lately, which to be honest reminds me of a frozen pizza..but don't let that throw you off.  It's like a good version of a cheap pizza I grew up on, I love it. The only complaints I have, which I'm so hoping will be fixed with time (since it's new) is the time we have to wait for the food and drinks to be served, and how cold it is in there. I'll be honest the last time I went, it was a great temp, but the other times..I've been frozen..and I don't get cold often. I think that the design of the restaurant is what is leading to some of the wait times being so long. Although I did mention that it takes too long to get food and the waiter said there are some issues with the kitchen staff (apparently attitudes). We've been when it was busy and when it was slow, still had to wait longer than normal to get our food. I do think some of the waiters are just really inexperienced. The previous time we went we had a great waiter named Zac. I do think the menu is way too overwhelming but oh well, at least there's variety. We use the app every time, we've used it to be put on the list, and there's a ton of deals they send to your email.

We were so excited when we saw that one was opening up here but were very disappointed after our first visit. I ordered the balsamic glazed chicken and the meal would have been good if they used a better quality of chicken. It was so gross, hard to cut because it was tough/chewy, dry, and like stringy almost. This is a bummer because everything I love at BJ's includes chicken. It must be because they get their meat from somewhere else than the Gainesville location but they need to fix that or it may even be frozen. My fiancé had the pulled pork sandwich and wasn't a fan, it was just okay.

Terry G.,"Pensacola, FL",187,147,91,4.0,7/1/2016,"Though a friend and I went relatively early (430pm on a Wednesday) the place was already starting to get a good number of customers.  We were quickly shown to a comfortable, clean booth and given a menu that gives The Cheesecake Factory menus a run for their money.  This menu is big and it's got a little bit of everything. I enjoyed the BJ's Stout beer and my pizza.  The pizza was perfectly cooked, deep dish, with fresh veggies and lots of cheese.  Perfection.  In fact, so much perfection, I had to take half of it home in a box. Our server was quick, attentive, and answered any questions I had.  She did warn us that the steaks and ribs are hit and miss.  They're known for their pizza and beer, not their steaks.  I was happy to hear a server be candid and not try and up-sell at every turn. Looking around, the burgers and pasta dishes looked pretty darn good, too.  There's a dessert, called a Pizookie that's a pizza/cookie covered in ice cream made by angels.  They even have a monkey break Pizookie.  I didn't have room for it this trip, but I guarantee that I'll be back for at least one, as long as my doctor doesn't find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola
Rick A.,"Pensacola, FL",41,42,47,3.0,7/3/2016,"Sadly, I am a little disappointed.  It is a beautiful restaurant.   Our waiter was prompt and attentive.  The food order was correct. However,  the gluten-free pizza was compared to cicis (not flattering). I had the ravioli.   A beautiful dish that is pleasing to the eye and possess a fantastic aroma that comes from a great sauce.   There was a copious amount of cheese crowning the dish.  However,  this artistry was ruined by the chalky consistency of the filling.  Bottom Line:  It is not worth waiting for a table--sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola
Keith Q.,"Milton, FL",88,13,15,5.0,9/25/2016,"I visited a second time.  The first visit was not so good.... this visit was great. Savannahs J. was our server. Beer was cold, food was great, service was fantastic. Redemption has occurred and we are now believers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola
Nikki L.,"Atlanta, GA",59,57,61,5.0,5/15/2016,"This was my first time here and it was a great experience!! We ordered the chicken  bacon deep dish pizza and it was so delish!! I found a special on Yelp so we got the medium pizza, 2 salads, 2 sodas and 1 dessert to share. All for $25--the drinks were an additional $1 each!! Lauren was our waitress and she was attentive,  knowledgeable of the menu and she has a great personality!! I will be coming back to BJs when I come back home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola
Georgio B.,"Pensacola, FL",16,364,55,4.0,7/6/2016,"3 Visits in and I'm still a fan!    The apps are the star of the show here!  Load up on apps, skip the entrees. Spaghetti & meatballs was lacking in sauce, but otherwise okay. Bloody Marys are awesome!   Piranha Pale Ale was darn good too. So far, so good.  Let's see if they can keep it going.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-pensacola
