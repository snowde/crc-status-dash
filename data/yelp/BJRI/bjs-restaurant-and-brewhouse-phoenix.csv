Taylor M.,"Phoenix, AZ",76,268,621,5.0,6/3/2017,"Service: Had the perfect waiter. He knew the menu. Never had repeat orders or special requests. Was quick, got orders right. Our group was big too. Food: Special on ribs. Had whole rack, two sides (got soup for one without upcharge and clam chowder was best in town, large clams, no sand grit, perfect consistency), salad (got wedge), and pizoutti desert all for $18.95 at lunch.  Ambiance: No complaints. Five stars, first ever visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=20
Rachel D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,34,8,1.0,9/8/2017,"Tonight my friend and I ordered BJ's through door dash. Everything seemed to be in order until I realized my fries were not sweet potato as I requested but that was the least of my worries. Wait.... keep reading... I bit into my delicious looking turkey dip sandwich and was pleasantly surprised by the hearty turkey meat. Wait for it... I'm halfway through my sandwich when I realize my tongue feels a weird burning sensation. I look down at my food to find the culprit and as I turned the sandwich over I realized the bread was completely molded on the underside. Yes, you read that correctly. COMPLETELY MOLDED. I instantly felt a panic attack coming on. I called BJ's immediately and all I got was a 20 something year old manager that didn't seem too concerned. I was offered to have my order comped and that's it. There was no apology or any real sign of embarrassment for the fact that they serve moldy and potentially poisonous food to their customers. I am beyond horrified and angry. You couldn't pay me to eat food from this disgusting establishment again. I uploaded pictures and they can be seen towards the end of their photo gallery... enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=20
Bryce R.,"Guthrie, OK",0,16,,5.0,6/19/2017,"1st time ever being to a Bj's location, and was blown away. Our waiter Nick was absolutely on top of it the whole entire time we were there. To be honest it looked like all of the staff was working their butts off and getting things done. I just really have to say how awesome our waiter Nick was, super friendly and very informative!! The food was very flavorful, and not disappointing in any aspect. They have a portobello mushroom salad topped with goat cheese and cranberries that just exploded with flavor. The clam chowder in a bread bowl, don't even get me started. The bread bowl was toasted, I mean toasted golden brown awesomeness with clam chowder that definitely had plenty of clams in it. Not to mention their prime rib, was rubbed with the perfect amount of seasoning that was not too overwhelming. Plus you have to top it off with just a simple pizookie!  Great food, awesome staff, and just a great location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=20
Susan K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,9,,1.0,12/1/2017,"My husband and I were just at BJ's it was awful.

Ryan F.,"Ontario, CA",28,61,9,5.0,2/4/2017,"Applebees on steroids ladies and gentlemen, Applebees on steroids. A few of my mates and I came here after going to a Korean BBQ place for dinner. We were famished. Not to say the BBQ was bad, we are just football players that didn't make it to the big league and got the appetite to prove it, but not the wallets.  There is more food on that menu than there are numbers in Pi. I wouldn't say there is a preferred item to get on the menu, just get what fits your fancy. Really isn't a speciality place. You're gonna eat good and I mean good on a budget. Everything is reasonably priced. We left there with our tummies full and some money left over to have a real doozy on the town. 5/5 would do it again.

With appetizers averaging $9+ it wasn't much of a deal. Instead I ordered the ahi salad which was delicious however the ahi portion was also weak.  $15.50 for a salad and I expected a better ahi portion size.

Linda S.,"Glendale, AZ",5,45,110,2.0,6/20/2017,"Honestly something has happened to this place since the last time I've been here. The waitress was definitely not visiting our table for offering us additional drinks... Considering you're paying 1495 a burger you think they would give you more than eight Fry's on your plate besides that you think that they wouldn't put meat on a vegetarian burger, although the manager quickly resolve the issue it was still a great disappointment when you have a group of 9 people there for birthday party and 9 out of 9 people were disappointed with their food will not be returning unfortunately...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=20

Brad P.,"Phoenix, AZ",27,7,,3.0,2/7/2017,"My wife and I come here from time to time - usually when we want to get a burger and beer.  Happy hour pricing is not a great deal, but they have a decent beer selection and serve excellent veggie burgers which my wife loves.   Their menu is overwhelming.  It reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory - where you sit down and they give you a novel to read.  So many items! This time I tried a new item - the Late Night Burger.  Here's the description: Open-faced burger | housemade pork chile verde | Applewood smoked bacon | jack + cheddar cheese | fresh fried egg  I really should have taken a picture.  When I think of an open-faced burger I don't think of both buns laid out with a patty covering the middle.  If that were the case, I'd hope that the buns were smothered in the pork chile verde.  Unfortunately there was a good 2"" on either side of the burger + toppings of plain bun, rendering the open-faced concept quite questionable.  I'd happily eat it with a closed bun because this presentation did nothing for it. I ordered it medium (pink) with a sunny side egg.  They weren't extremely busy at the time, however my burger was well done with a fried egg that was practically over-hard. Overall the dish was a disappointment, having so much unused bread and it not cooked properly. The service is always pretty great, I'll give that to our waitress.  I had a question about a beer and she proactively gave me a sample.  If their service dropped in quality I probably wouldn't come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=20
Elizabeth D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,4,,5.0,5/4/2017,"I eat here all the time, the Ahi salad is my personal favorite. They are not a perfect restaurant but I don't think that there is one out there that is perfect unless you want to pay several hundred a plate. That being said I would still say that BJ's is one of my Favorite places to eat.  Breakdown my Favorite's Apps - Flatbread Nacho's are awesome Crispy Calamari are also great, I love the bits with the tentacles  The boneless wings are good, the regular wings aren't the best but they aren't horrible the Avocado Egg Rolls are bomb, a little spicy but super good.  Small bites Salsa, Guac, Queso, and Salsa are all on point the stuff mushrooms are really good, the sauce is yumtastic Entrees Fire Roasted Barbacoa chicken is pretty good Spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles...bad-a** pad thai  Asian chopped salad i think is ok, my friend loves it cherry chipotle glazed salmon is super good  Mediterranean chicken tacos are really good the turkey burger is one of my favorite turkey burgers in the valley barbacoa cauliflower pita, sounds weird but is pretty good, kinda tastes like chicken lol Maple salmon tacos are so good, sweet and tangy  the Ahi Salad, is my utmost favorite, i order that all the time, its so good, tangy sweet spicy (with copious amounts of wasabi i add)  Shrimp and asparagus penne is not bad, i am not a big pasta fan in general but I killed it.  The super salad, not one to cheat on my ahi salad but this one holds its own. Sandwiches the hand pulled turkey dip is awesome, the horseradish sauce and the au jus make is yummy California chicken club is pretty decent mahi mahi taco's definitely one of the favs, super good.

However was REALLY disappointed in the host staff, we had a little bit of a large party and they wouldn't accommodate us. We had to wait for our waiter to come around to ask if we could push some tables together so our group could be together. Even when I asked the host if we could  push some tables together he got a major attitude, and walked away without getting his manager like I asked.

Melanie A.,"Desert View Village, Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,12/13/2017,"My significant other and I have been eating at BJs for the past 5 years, usually multiple times per week. We are disappointed after tonight's visit and unfortunately will never return. Things have gone downhill for the last year but have been really bad the last several months. We miss the excellent personable waitstaff and management that used to run this restaurant. Other reviewers have recently talked about the food coming out COLD and lacking in quality control. After waiting an hour, the first time our food came out, it was obvious it had been sitting there for awhile. The mushroom appetizer was cold, the lettuce wrap appetizer had cold chicken and the jambalaya was luke warm. We asked for the food to be remade from scratch because mushrooms taste horrible warmed up in a microwave. Then the food came out again 30 minutes later and the food was the same, not hot! The manager on duty argued with us saying he personally witnessed the cook making it and he kept saying it was hot although he refused to touch my mushroom when I asked him to in order to feel how cold it was. He then accused us of ""always"" complaining when we have been there literally over 200 times and he has only been managing for a month or so. And here is where I have an issue, he slipped and said, ""do you want me to warm these up AGAIN"" when he just had said he had the cook remake the dishes from scratch and witnessed it. He was overly condescending and not friendly at all. We miss the manager Gunner who was so personable and had excellent control over the restaurant! He made it feel like a tight knit family atmosphere and made an effort to come talk to us every time we came and knew us by name. And just for the record, we loved this place, the food, and the service for many years and tipped the staff upwards of 40% each time and never had problems with anyone, even the waitstaff knew us by name!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=20

The starter was brought out at the same time as the burgers and, and felt a little rushed. -2nd- The Peruvian quinoa bowl with chicken was light and very flavorful (the tomatoes were great), it was very good.  The grilled chicken alfredo wasnt bad either.  The boneless wings was kinda dry, and it was more batter then chicken.  The triple chocolate pizookie was action packed with choclate, and choosing vanilla ice cream helped balance it out.

I had a bacon avocado burger and it should had been named the lime juicebuger.

Alisha L.,"Fargo, ND",114,27,8,1.0,1/12/2018,"Today I went in & ordered. We ordered ham & cheesesanwich deal, hot Nashville chicken, & corn dogs with fries. So all seemed to go well when they brought my child's meal out right away.  Once our meals came everything looked good but they forgot ranch. I asked for the 2nd time to the person that delivered when they asked what else I needed. 15 min went by as I sat with my meal waiting for my ranch. I asked my husband how his meal was& he said it was missing something. Someone came by again & asked if we needed anything besides our refills & I declared the ranch again because I hadn't gotten to take a bite of my chicken yet. Once the server was gone my husband realized there was a sauce that came with his meal.  They finally came Ruth ranch & I wasn't worth mentioning because he had already ate 2/3 his meal wondering what was missing. My chicken was cold by the time I got my ranch that I ordered with the meal. My child was flipping out towards the end & im not sure I tasted much. I like this place but I feel like if you're going to charge the prices that you do...I should have this occur. No one even acknowledged their mistakes & no apology at all.

My husband ordered the bacon turkey club sandwich which was quite big. I ordered a clam chowder bowl. Very good clam chowder with plenty of clams in it.

Jessica G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,38,,5.0,7/1/2017,"My husband and I had a date night here the other night. The food and ambience were pretty good. I loved the Brussel sprouts appetizer. The service started strong, but declined as the night continued. The server became increasingly irritable throughout the night. It could have been a bad night, understandable. When we go out we like to relax and take our time- a departure from regular life. So the kicker for us was that the server dropped the check before the dessert even arrived and continued to point out that the check was there. I get it- you want to turn your table, but this was inappropriate.  I would think that this isn't company policy to rush their guests out the door.  Assuming that this is just a fluke we will probably be back because the food was delicious.  Update: So hubby and I returned to indulge my preggo craving of potato skins. I read an article that featured BJs in the top 10 of potato skins in Phx, so I was sold. Soooooooo glad that we did. Those little nuggets of carbs and fat were delectable. My little boy was dancing in utero out of gratitude. Our server, Erin I think, was fantastic. She appeared swamped but handled it like a pro. There was a tiny issue with food (not her fault) but her approach was top notch customer service.

David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,4.0,6/24/2017,"Still a solid 4...just a couple added thoughts: The flat bread pizza is only so-so. Not worth it at full price. Maybe worth it for the weekday special deal. The crust is like a Saltine cracker. The amount of meat protein toppings is seriously lacking. You're better off doing the ""make your own"" at one of the flash-fired pizza places. The pot stickers were surprisingly tasty. I guess I just didn't expect that from a brew pub with such a varied menu. The ribs are inconsistent from visit to visit. But the Ghirardeli triple chocolate pizzookie is really tasty.

Steve G.,"Union, NJ",538,809,,2.0,8/14/2014,"Although previously unknown to me, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a part of a large, multistate chain.  Their standards of food and service easily identify this realization, in spite of the fact that it is stated on their menu. Not to be misunderstood, the turkey club sandwich that I ordered wasn't bad, and the requisite flavors were all there.  Sloppy assembly and plating, however, illustrated the plight of a kitchen slammed at lunchtime and simply trying to move to the next order.  To say that there was no ""love"" put into this sandwich would be an understatement. Our server (I believe that his name was Johnny) was apologetic- even funny- about how backed-up the kitchen was.  Yes, service was slower-than-slow, but a personable and attentive server made the extended wait somewhat bearable. Their desserts looked great, and I'm not a dessert eater.  Unfortunately, we wouldn't have had the rest of the afternoon to wait for them.

CJ J.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,57,3,1.0,11/30/2014,"My first experience at BJ's could best be summed up as ""crap-tastic."" Here's how I arrived at that conclusion: -Bad Service: My server looked like hated his life; he never cracked a smile once, nor did he ever check on or refill our our drinks, which were empty halfway through the meal. -Dirty Glassware: At first glance, my water glass looked like it had some sort of flashy green garnish, like a mint julep might have. But this isn't the Kentucky Derby; this is BJ's. That green leafy thing sticking to the outside rim of my glass was a big ass piece of lettuce from someone else's meal, steam-stuck to the outside of my beverage. The offending lettuce was so big, so Mt. Rushmore-esque in size that I really don't know how even the busiest server could have missed it. Yuck. -Bad Timing: The appetizers took 20 minutes to arrive; entrees came out roughly 2 minutes later. -Improper temperatures: The nachos and the fried artichokes came out together; the nachos were stone cold, but the artichokes were nuclear hot. My chicken wings were crispy and delicious, but my boyfriend's wedge fries were cold next to a lukewarm hamburger.  Less than 2 hours after eating at BJ's, dinner revisited both of us with a vengeance. . . in the bathroom.

The server (with disclaimer that he has never been to Chicago) suggested the Californian-Chicago style pizza. We were hungry so it filled a void, but I would never call it Chicago style.

They lost a customer tonight. This is not the first time I've had bad service but it will be the last as I won't return. There are tons of other restaurants to spend my money at and that provide much better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=80

Where else can you find a fun little restaurant style sports bar open till midnight. It's great for industry peeps. Last but not least, Stewart is the best.

At that point we already knew we just wanted dessert. we ordered our food and the waiter very sarcastically corrected my order, which was entirely unnecessary since it was plain as day as to what I wanted. We waited nearly 30 minutes for our food, and as soon as it came out he handed the food to us with our check without even asking if we wanted anything else. We waited another 15 minutes after we were finished eating just for him to get done talking to his coworker and pick up our check. He didn't even acknowledged our presence, swiped our card and then thought it was be a great idea to be somewhat friendly to us just so he'd get a tip. As we left, we again saw the unfriendly host and another worker chatting, therefore, we also were never acknowledged on our way out either.

I'm sure if I would've complained my food was overcooked, they would've done something. But all I got was, very simply, ""we're sorry"". Well, apology accepted, but I'm disappointed.

The in- betweens:  The lighting. Low lighting that probably makes every-one have a ""soft focus"" effect and look prettier :)  However, the lighting  casts a weird glare on their menu which makes it even more difficult to read.  The Cons: Menu too large to be able to specialize and pick something spectacular. I had the Mediterranean Tacos which my server claimed to be one of his favorites. I had no idea what I was eating, it was flavorless. The Mediterranean Tacos were supposed to have Feta but the Feta looked like a sprinkling of salt.

I went with my family kind of early which was nice, because we just beat the rush! We were seated right away, and our server was kind and did a good job. To start off we ordered mozzarella sticks. I can be picky when it comes to my m-sticks, but these ones were incredibly good, was hard not to eat all of them. Didn't come with enough marinara sauce. One great thing about BJs is the massive menu, there are so many amazing options to choose from, it is hard! On Sunday I was struggling between going for the Avocado Eggrolls (used to order these all the time back in high school) or the roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread. My mom and I decided we would get both of them and then split them! I hate to say it, but the Avocado Eggrolls just were not near as good as I had remembered them. They were kinda too cream cheese-y and spicy. They were ok, just not great. The flatbread on the other hand was incredible! I think I may have tried it once before about a year ago, but it was so delicious. Wish I had only ordered that!  For dessert we had to finish off with a pizookie..it is a BJs must! We just got a regular one. My only problem was that the cookie was all stuck to the pan! Had to kind of scrape it out. We destroyed it though, it was incredible.

Craig G.,"Jersey City, NJ",90,305,70,3.0,8/5/2014,"Located in one of the many shopping complexes ringing the north side of Phoenix, BJ's is a brewpub/sports bar serving up casual fare at bargain prices. Blame it on the lunch rush: service was at a crawl, though the waiter was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. And the food was fine. I went with the Parmesan-crusted chicken sandwich, a chicken breast coated with Parmesan bread crumbs and served between a soft roll with lettuce, tomato, and a garlic dressing. A little heavy on the lettuce and tomato and light on the coating, but a good sandwich with particularly good thin-cut fries.

Doug S.,"Spring, TX",164,185,19,4.0,1/14/2016,"My wife and I met one of her college friends and her friend's husband for drinks.  We arrived around 3:30 / 4:00 in the afternoon and sat at the bar.  The bar staff when we first arrived were good, but the bartenders that took their place were much better.  I believe one of the bartenders' name was Ryan.  He was alot of fun!!  He was personable and friendly, and was cracking jokes with us and the staff throughout the night.  He was very attentive to our needs.  Some of the beers that I tried were Sculpin IPA (Ballast Point Brewing and Spirits from San Diego, CA), Union Jack IPA (Firestone Walker Brewing Company from Paso Robles, CA), and Jeremiah Red from BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.  All three were cold and very tasty.  The IPA's were what I would call on the lighter side for an IPA.  Not really a strong taste to them.  We have a BJ's near us in The Woodlands, TX that we've been to before.  But this experience was much fun, and Ryan made it entertaining for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=60
Frank D.,"Phoenix, AZ",18,360,141,3.0,12/4/2015,"BJ's was a decent experience for my girlfriend and I.  We stopped in for an early dinner one night and some cocktails. There weren't any drink specials offered when we were there, but they do have a nice selection of drinks to choose from. I enjoyed a mojito, while my girl had a long-island iced tea.  Our server was super friendly, very accommodating and he took his time serving us so we could relax and not feel ""rushed"" to eat and leave. I ended up ordering their baked ziti and it was very good. The portion size was surprisingly small given the portions of their other plates.  For the two of us, a couple drinks each and dinner set me back nearly $70 (including a coupon for $10 off that my girlfriend had). I felt that for a chain restaurant, that was a bit high. I almost thought I was overcharged, but didn't feel like reviewing everything so I just took the hit end left.

Nick J.,"Milwaukee, WI",72,46,11,4.0,6/5/2012,"As a large chain I will say that I am a fan of BJ's. One of the nice things is that this location is just like every other location, in that its the same menu and same food.  One thing that i love about BJ's is that I have always had good service, they do a great job of training and making sure that it is done right. Sometimes during busy times there can be issues with not getting your food as quickly but that is what is expected. Sitting at the bar is also a prime spot with the large amount of TV's and a solid selection of draft beer. When it comes to their ""craft"" beers they are hit or miss. As a huge fan of a good beer I cant say I love BJ's brews but they also offer a decent other selection. When it comes to food they are pretty solid all around. The ""deep dish"" pizza is good, i enjoy the BBQ and the pepperoni. You cant go wrong with any of the sandwiches or burgers they are all solid. During my last visit i enjoyed the wings as an appetizer and used the wing sause and ranch as a dipping sause for the crispy thin fries. Delicious! Best part about all the food i will say is the pizookie, i love the pizookie! you have to try it.  Overall, BJ's is good a little bit pricey for what you get but they do a quality job on all the food and service and are fairly consistent in all their locations.

This is a huge accident waiting to happen.   We started out our meal with the calamari appetizer. This was very good. No issues there.  Then with the meal, I ordered the margarita flat bread. I have ordered this before and loved it. Tonight was not the same. I think it had been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile before it was brought to the table. The last time I remember that it had more fresh basil on it, too. This time the basil didn't even cover the entire pizza and it was not very fresh. I couldn't even taste it. My daughter ordered the shrimp scampi. She asked for some grated Parmesan on it and they brought her some packets of Parmesan and told her they couldn't find the grater.  Really?  I am giving them 2 stars only because I know how good it can be ... how good it has been.  I don't know what is going on here but they need some serious attention from upper management to get it back to where it used to be starting with the broken chairs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=180

My wife didn't like them saying they were soggy. I thought they were ok but rather scrawny. They need larger ramekins to dip in too.  I had the 5 meat deep dish and I was astonished how good it was.

Meredith W.,"Glendale, AZ",291,13,1,1.0,9/7/2013,"My boyfriend decided that he wanted to have his 22nd birthday dinner at Bj's, it made sense because we were going to Dave and Busters afterwards. I called about four days in advance to make a reservation for 15 people at 8:15pm. I spoke with a manager and everything was worked out. We arrived a little early, around 8, and were told that our reservation had been changed to 8:30. This was unbeknownst to me which was irritating because they had my number on file and I had 15 hungry people showing up expecting to be seated at 8:15. Well, unfortunately this was just the start of things! We didn't ACTUALLY sit down at 8:30, we didn't even get seated at 9! We sat down to eat dinner around 9:15, PERFECT! By this point most of us were tired and mostly just wanted to go home. Personally I didn't even care about the fact that I was hungry anymore. So they assigned two servers to our table because we were such a large party which made me happy, I thought that would mean better service oh boy was I wrong! Our drinks took 20 minutes to come out, seriously? So we all put our order in and instead of entering all of our orders AT ONE TIME in the computer our servers entered them at randomly different times so all of our food came out randomly. Now let me add that everyone in this party has either served or worked in the restaurant industry before and we all know that when there's two of you, bringing 15 people drinks and appetizers should NEVER take 20-30 minutes. Now as far as the food goes, EH. Mediocre at best. The Long Islands were ten dollars and they tasted like shit. I had a five dollar Mai Tai and it was probably the most delicious thing I had all night! The ONLY thing I can give them credit for is their spinach artichoke dip, that was heavenly. Now we had all planned on leaving Bj's around 10:30 because Dave and Busters closes at one on Fridays. We didn't even get our checks until 11. SHOCKING. So we didn't end up walking out the front doors until 11:30. I was furious to say the least. All in all, I would NEVER EVER EVER reccomend this place to ANYONE or EVER come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=200
Todd H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",22,287,386,3.0,1/22/2012,"To explain my rating, please remember that 3 stars means A-OK, it is not a bad rating, but it doesn't mean excellent either. A group of 9 of us stopped there just after 8 PM on a Saturday night.  One would think being able to get in to a restaurant at Desert Ridge on a Saturday night would not be easy but they seated us immediately.  The place was full but not packed.  It was a pleasure to go to a place that is not so noisy that you can't have a conversation with the others in your group.  I think part of that is that BJ's was designed with good acoustics.  We were surrounded by other diners but the noise level was well tolerable. Our waitress was generally pleasant, but we agreed she looked bored, or even upset. She messed up numerous times throughout the meal in taking orders and bringing the right items.  Again, the place wasn't that busy that she was overloaded. As far as the food is concerned, I give BJ's high marks.  I am generally not a fan of chain restaurants (although BJ's isn't as huge a chain as Olive Garden for example).  The menu is creative and varied and surprisingly inexpensive.  Most of us started with a beer, and we all liked the featured selection. Although BJ's originally started as primarily a pizza place, they now offer a lot of different types of foods, many of which are not usually found in restaurants of this type.  None of us had Italian food however.  My choice was Cajun Talapia, two large filets cooked as perfectly as you can imagine, over a bed of rice and seved with a spring salad.  The entre was served with a half lemon that was blackened at one end, perfect to squeeze on the fish and salad, resulting in a low calorie meal.  Although the entre was under $10 the quantity of food was quite filling. Others in our party had burgers, jambalaya, thai shrimp lettuce wraps and a nice Ahi Poke, all of which looked delicious.  Everyone in our group agreed the food was great and the prices were reasonable.  Our only negative was that the waitress wasn't that great. BJ's is a cut above the typical chain restaurant but not at a higher price.  Just an informal place to enjoy a decent meal with family or friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=200

The service by Brandon was excellent, but please tone it down on the upselling. He made a great suggestion regarding getting double meatballs in the Calzone as one of the two additional toppings that comes with the dish. The nachos were good, but could have used some Guac and Jalapenos to bring it up to excellent. The meatball Calzones were excellent (better than Uncle Sam's I'm told, sorry Sammy).  I know Chicago Deep Dish Pizza, and you Sir, are not Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. Not even close, that's why the Yelp rating for this restuarant takes a header. This is what a Chicago Deep Dish Pizza looks like.......http://www.giordanos.com/. Their pizza was just a lot of crust with a thin layer of cheese and toppings.

Mark H.,"Phoenix, AZ",46,20,3,5.0,3/5/2011,"Hadn't been to BJ's for a few years and I had forgotten how great the food is there.  Went on a busy Friday night, but only had to wait about 20 minutes or so to be seated. Started with classic potato skins.  Perfect.  Cheddar, bacon, and cheese with sour cream and/or ranch dressing.   Bring friends, this is not a single serving plate. For the entree I chose the Tuscan Chicken Lemone.  It's new on the menu and I hope they keep it for a some time.  Wonderful flavor - lemon and butter, good stuff.  Pasta was tasty too.  And the cheese bread?  Don't get me started.  Normally at BJ's I would have a beer, but I felt like something different so I ordered a nonalcoholic berry cider.  Only lightly sweet and very snappy, it was quite refreshing and a nice change from overly ambitious drinks that crowd out the flavors of a good meal. Too full for desert so nothing to report.  The service was very good - prompt, accurate, and engaging.   The only issue we had was with the fold out extension for our table.  Every time my friend (G.) hit the top of the table too hard (he's a big guy, but still) the magnetic latch would give way and the extension would swing down and whack one of us in the leg.  After a while I just moved my leg out of harms way and was mildly entertained every time G. would get stung in the thigh.  Probably an anomaly, but a stronger magnet might be a good idea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=200

My wife had one of the pizzas that had what appeared to be canned or stewed tomatoes on it which she thought were rather bland and tasteless.   I wasn't able to sample any of the brew selections due to constraints of the diet, but my wife did have a pint of their featured ale and she said it was really good.  The service was decent, and there was about a 15 minute wait to get seated.  All in all, I don't think I'd go back and so I'm filing this one under, ""been there, done that...You can keep the tee shirt.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=220

Sean C.,"Boston, MA",161,383,1,3.0,12/28/2009,"Vacation time spent by a trip to see the family is generally rife with compromises. After failing to produce an agreement on anything we all really wanted, we ended up at the somewhat unfortunately named BJ's Brewhouse. I half expected to see gaggles of teenage boys and tweenage girls (of roughly the same maturity level) stifling giggles about what ""BJ"" might stand for, but did not. The other half expected the food to be disappointing and for me to be already longing for some good Szechuan before I'd been in Arizona 2 hours, and pleasantly did not experience that either. Standard chain decor, standard chain service, standard ratio of operational to non-operational men's room stalls (non-zero.) We opted for the stealth $20 email special of a shared medium pizza (any specialty or number of toppings), a shared ""pizookie"" dessert and individual soup or salad which I would strongly recommend since normally a specialty pizza itself is $20. The starter? Minestrone with a bit of cheese. Italian. Adequate. Unremarkable. The pizza? A paradoxically Chicago-style Southwestern, like a chain boutique version of Pizza Hut. Solid crust, great by Seattle standards (low.) The dessert? A very thin (Peanut Butter, among the 5+ varieties) cookie in a pancake-sized tin topped with vanilla ice cream. I was more preoccupied with whether Madame K's Pizza Brothel, er, Bistro in Seattle copied the Screaming Orgasm from them or vice-versa (and thinking they would have been better off to copy BJ's pizza) than the experience of the sweet cookie. The verdict? For optimizing any particular aspect, one could do better elsewhere, but the pizza is quite good among mostly forgettable accompaniments. Chains are generally compromise candidates, and in that vein, BJ's Brewhouse performs the job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=220

Tracy T.,"Phoenix, AZ",135,163,32,4.0,11/22/2009,"The main reason for the four stars is for their Angus Roast Beef Dip -- it is delicious!  It is up there on my list of favorite French Dips. The meat is super tender and juicy, and the horseradish spread really compliments the sandwich. Plus, it is a great condiment to dip your french fries in.   The portions are huge -- my sister ordered the Sesame Chicken Salad and she barely ate half of it. I, of course, devoured my sandwich. They have a huge menu, with a lot to choose from. They seem to be known for their pizzas, which look really yummy too. The atmosphere is similar to most sports bars, although I'd say this place is more of a ""high-end"" sports bar with chandeliers and mood lighting instead of ripped vinyl and dirty blinds.  There is a massive flat screen TV. above the bar, and little ones interspersed throughout the restaurant. The wait can be a bit long on Friday nights and weekends, but you can call ahead to get your name on the wait list.  And, they are nice enough to offer you some small pizza bites while you wait. Overall, BJ's is your standard chain restaurant/sports bar, but with a few extra niceties to make it stand out above the rest.  I'll be back for sure, and maybe next time I'll venture outside my love-for-the-french-dip and try some of their other goodies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=220

The restaurants is large in size, with a nice bar area and large screen TVs you can see from pretty much anywhere you sit.  They are also very family friendly, and can get quite crowded, especially on the weekends.  Despite the place being packed, and our server being the only one in the bar area, service was very good and very friendly.  They also have a take-out option (similar to what Chili's does), and I saw quite a few people while I was here take advantage of this service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=260

It took me 4 tries of this company before I realized I was never going to leave thrilled and to just give up on BJ's.  The service on average is slow and at times moody (with the customers that is, with other staff members they goof around and snap each others exposed thongs-that was a bad dining experience). The food is bland and boring.  On my final visit my boyfriend's entree came out to the table and mine was nowhere in site.  Five minutes later our server finally came by to tell me that my chicken had been burnt and it was the last one they had, he was oh so kinda as to ask me if I wanted to order something else.  WTF?

Kenny B.,"Snellville, GA",32,21,,3.0,6/4/2009,"I suppose my score would teeter in the gray area of a 3.5. This place has it's great points: good, brewed beer; incredible deep-dish pizzas loaded with toppings; and, from what I saw, attractive wait staff (always a bonus).  My short-comings list would be: the Applebee's-esque environment; and horrible placement/identifying of the facilities. Those don't seem major, but when you need to go number 1 between well-crafted home brews, you don't need to make laps around the place. Especially weaving your way around the islands of high schoolers who are enamored to be there. Also, given that this place attempts to combine the sports bar with a family place to dine, it clashes too loudly and, on a packed-out night, I could see this place being overkill. I know this might be coming off harsh because they do have some magic working for them. Their pizzas are bomb. In this new age of pizzas with thinner crusts, these pies kick it old school with their Chicago style crusts. Complimented by their over-abundance of toppings, these pizzas rock. That is all I can say for their amazingness. You will have to try the pizza for yourself. As far as brew goes, with me being a beer snob, this was a good brew. I ordered the Kolsch and my broseph selected the Porter. Both had a good consistency and overall taste. The Kolsch was a little reminiscent of Four Peaks kolsch, perhaps with less vanilla. It had a some characteristics of a red ale to it. Overall,  I feel like they can put out some good beers. So looking back over this, I will bump up my teetering score to 3.75.

It is a great place for beer lover's because they brew their own brew, that's actually pretty good unlike some brewery's. For the underage or non-beer drinkers they also have draft root beer which is absolutely amazing.  There specializes are massive potatoes and pizza. To be honest the pizza is good but not great. It is suppose to be Chicago style deep dish but comes up short for true Chi-town pizza lovers. The potatoes, which are there own meals, are unlike anything I've ever had. They are very filling and very good. My favorite is the Blackened Chicken which comes with a potatoes, spiced chicken, cheese, red peppers, and Alfredo sauce to dip your bites in.  Also the sandwiches are great. The French Dip and BBQ Beef is highly recommended. If you have room for dessert, the freshly made cookie and ice cream called poozkie is great. A little secret is about BJ's is that all of the lunch specials that are said to be over at 4, are always available if you ask. The best is the half potato and soup/salad.

As mentioned in other reviews these folks work real hard at ""upselling"" which is what they are supposed to do but it needs to be done with a better delivery, not so much of the car sales extra warranty and rain protector package. Now the food is about as boring and bland as anything I have ever had. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms for the table as an appitizer, this may sound stupid but all they tasted like were mushrooms. They are supposed to be stuffed with some other stuff but did not detect much of that. On to the entrees. I ordered the fried artichoke hearts with an aoli dipping sauce. They tasted like crunchy. Thats rite crunchy, no flavor at all. I ate 1 and became disenchanted. My mother had the pork chop and told me to have a bite so I could be a believer in there food again. It was served with sauteed onions so all I tasted was onion, again lack of any disconcerable flavor I.E. pork. I must say that my 1 year old daughter enjoyed her Mac N Cheese and apple sauce very much.Oh my other daughter ordered the mini corn dogs but got Mac N Cheese. The server offerd to correct it but we didnt really care any more. 1 thing I found odd was that at no time did the server ask any of us how the food was even though I clearly had not eaten any of mine and nor had my wife, (chicken lettuce wraps) they were'nt bad just not good.

Nowadays there is always a wait for this hot spot at Desert Ridge. Although BJ's does do a good pizza nothing about the restaurant or service really stands out to me. The service has always been hit or miss in my experience, and the huge menu can actually be a little daunting. One time while feeling like a healthier option I tried the other famous item on the menu the big baked potato. The potato was extremely dry and lacking in advertised size, so I left hungry and disappointed. Although average, I would recommend BJ's for dates and group gatherings as it is an open atmosphere with a menu that can please just about any one.

Emilie P.,"Phoenix, AZ",55,51,17,3.0,1/8/2014,"Reasonable HH in the bar area that is great for an after-work hangout. We ordered quite a few things off the specials and finished them all without complaints. In sum: -California flatbread was tasty and completely made by the bacon. Toppings were not plentiful, but adequate and the HH portion was reasonably cut into 4 portions. Not bad for $4, but I wouldn't order the standard size.  -Boneless buffalo wings were just as you'd expect. I like variations on other dishes, but don't mess with my buffalo. Good job on keeping it standard. -Spinach-stuffed mushrooms (not on HH, but ~$5 for a small plate) were not my favorite. If you like lightly flavored 'shrooms, then great. I, however, expected more flavor and these were drab.  -Avocado egg rolls were my favorite overall. Unique (at least to me!) and creamy, with a hint of spice that leaves you guessing what's going on in there. Our waiter was great, non-intrusive (though we hung out for about 2 hours), and cute...so that's a win! My standard gin & soda was actually kinda strong...in a good way! Though BJ's did not blow me away, it's nice, comfortable food that is great for all folks. I'll be back to try some of their extensive menu offerings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=160

I'm a Chicago pizza snob and I really did enjoy the thin crust with pepperoni & sausage - simple & delicious! My only rub on this place is the service.  Our first visit was horrible!! The place was more than half empty yet we still had to wait for 15 minutes for them to ""clear a table"" and then we had one server take our drink orders, then another shows up ten minutes after we got our drinks and proceeds to welcome us again & asks if we wants any drinks. WTF? Then we had a third server take our food order! It just made us dizzy and each one seemed more confused then the last. The second visit was better however, I overheard the table next to us complain because they didn't get the extra garlic bread they ordered until the meal was done. It cracked me up when a server finally brings the bread when they are paying the bill and says ""Do you still want this?"" So, good food - spotty service....place was packed on Friday night though. Oh, I forgot to mention - a glass of house wine - house wine - I did say house wine right? 10.25!! Yikes! house wine!???!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=160

Cassie M.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,47,11,2.0,12/11/2015,"Went there for lunch today and this had to be one of the worst eating out experiences I have had in a long time.  To start, it took 8 mins before anyone acknowledged me sitting there. It wasn't until my friend showed up until we were greeted and asked for drinks. We knew what we wanted so we ordered our food at that time too. The meal did come out timely even with the lunch rush. (Earned one star). However, we noticed instantly that there was a long black hair in the coleslaw. No one came back to refill our drinks or ask how the meal was. We were forced to eat the remaining part of our meals while the black hair in the food started at us. The salad plate and side dish were stacked on top of each other at the end of our small 2 person booth. No one stopped to pick it up. We waited and waited for the server to come by so we could get out check. I eventually had to flag down another server to help find ours. At that time we made him aware of the black hair, requested that side item to be removed off the bill. He finally removed those dishes from the table but left our other food plates in front of us.  The manager came by (2nd star earned) apologized and removed an entire meal off the bill. He was the one that removed the last of the remaining food plates.  It took us 1 and a half hours to eat lunch and check out at this place. With the hair, crummy service and mediocre food, we will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=160

Service was very poor with inattentive waitress that had zero personality.  I really don't understand this whole runner concept. Our food was literally dropped off at our table & there was no sign of our waitress to see if we needed anything, which we did.  Our son in laws order was wromg & there were no condiments for hubbies fries. So we waited & waited.   This is unacceptable for the prices we had to pay for rather mediocre food at best. We will not return again. There are too many good places that we can go to. Don't waste your time or $ here. Also when I asked our server for J&B scotch she didn't think they had it.  She was unwilling to go check & after some reluctance on her part found out they did have it.  Go figure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=160

Bill J.,"Glendale, AZ",44,173,660,4.0,12/30/2012,"I've been going to this location off and on for a couple of years now, typically for lunch with friends, colleagues or family, and it's never really disappointed me.  I'm a huge fan of their tomato soup, greasy though it might be sometimes, it is nonetheless delicious and I always have to have it. My only gripe is that their idea of a 'bowl' of soup is basically a coffee mug, not an actual bowl. If you're hungry, make sure you order the bowl or you'll probably only get about a shot glass worth from the 'cup' version.  For the lunch specials, my favorite has long been the chicken fettuccine, which has always been good, although I must admit I've had mixed experience with the pulled pork sandwich and the blonde shrimp, both a tying for a close second. Both the pork and the shrimp I've gotten in bad form a few times, not wretch inducing or anything, but it's definitely been sub-par from time to time (tough pork, badly battered shrimp, etc.). I've always gotten a sincere apology when things go awry and offers to make it right, but I have to hand it to them that there's never been an issue with the pasta or the chicken therein, so I keep my fingers crossed and stick with that these days.   If I'm not in the mood for pasta, my new second favorite is to go with their BBQ chicken pizza, another item that they've managed to be very consistent with. Probably not the best pizza out there, but for the money, it's certainly par for the course.  Service is typically pretty good, but if they're packed for lunch, you can generally expect the drink service to fall off the radar. This has been a consistent theme, regardless of who our server is, but it's hard to blame them when the place is packed. They definitely fill up quick around lunch time, so get there early if you want brisk service!  On the whole, I've no issues going back to this place. I haven't gotten any serious complaints from anyone I've taken here, whether they're friends, coworkers or visiting family members, so that says a lot. I'll definitely be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=160
Michael D.,"Mesa, AZ",48,44,15,2.0,10/17/2012,"First the good: I love the fact that as a business, BJ's supports groups like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and is doing things in October for breast cancer awareness. I like that they have good seasonal brews - the pumpkin ale was quite tasty. They have a sizable menu - and the quality of the food is pretty darn good all around. However. The quality of the service keeps us from making this place a regular stop. It's just so sporadic - sometimes it's all right and sometimes it's sub-par like today. We were greeted warmly, our server (Erica A) came quickly and when asked for an additional minute returned quickly to take our order. This is where it all fell apart. After taking our order, we saw her only once more before paying our check. I know our $25 order wasn't laden with lucrative alcohol - but no refills on water, showing disappointment when only one of us ordered more than water, having to flag a bus boy for silverware while our appetizer got cold, watching the manager watch the football game more than the service - it all just sours us from coming more frequently.  It's a place that I'd like to come for happy hour post-work - but I just never feel good about suggesting it with the experiences we've had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=160
John H.,"Mountain View, CA",60,112,23,4.0,2/21/2013,"Good food, great service, reasonable prices.   My only complaint is that, like many other places that THINK they serve Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, they don't.  What they claim is deep-dish is, in fact, just thick crust pizza - a loaf of bread with ingredients - far removed from what you get on Wabash Street in Chicago.   Chicago deep-dish is baked in a pan, but the crust is THIN.  It's the ingredients that make it a meal-on-a-slice.  Did it taste good?  Yes.  Would I have it again?  Sure, it was flavorful.  But if you are expecting TRUE deep-dish pizza, this isn't it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-phoenix?start=160

A new group was seated by us and they were served almost immediately by another waiter.

Thank god the bartender was on point that night, that was about the only thing that saved our night. By the time our food got to us though the drinks had watered down from us trying to make them last..... never ever again.

I like the toppings and overall flavor, but the bun failed. It was too big and didn't hold up to the burger. Half way through the bottom pretty much disappeared and I was left with the crunchy top part. The skinny fries were very good. The light Thai salad was decent but way over dressed. Good and friendly server who quickly replaced our first order of fries after they came to us cold. He even brought an extra order with our meal. Overall, decent food, good service, but it felt like a soulless corporate place.

Nice ambience and very modern looking with lots of TVs. The place was packed and seemed like everyone was having a good time. Pretty loud and I would say normal for a brewery restaurant.  I had the deep dish BJ Favortite pizza. Let see it had pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, green peppers, mushrooms, & tomatoes. The pizza was good. Nice crust. Soft and chewy but again nothing compares to a Chicago deep dish. So it was pretty good. Not great.  My wife had the mediterranean chicken pita tacos. She thought they were okay. The chicken was a little dry. My son had the baby back ribs with clam chowder and Caesar salad. He thought it was okay but he did eat it all.  Can you say starving. Of course, we had to get a Pizookie. It's a must. We ordered the salted Carmel Pizookie. It came with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The cookie was warm not really hot but was good. Really liked the dessert.  Our server was pretty good. He greeted us pretty quickly and took our order. Only problem is that we had to ask for water refills but once we ask he was pretty good in refilling. He did apologized to us because he was so busy. Understandable. He was good in clearing out dishes and did check up on us every once in awhile.  So I thought the food was okay, service was okay and atmosphere was good. I'm sitting here scratching my head in how BJ's is always so busy. Packed house and waiting line.
