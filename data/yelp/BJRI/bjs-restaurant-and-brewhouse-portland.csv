Heather S.,"Portland, OR",75,62,1,2.0,5/20/2015,"It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night.  Our server was definitely stressed, as my sweet 10 year old son said ""I can see it in her eyes"".  I get the feeling that's pretty much the corporate norm there.  She handled it well and was friendly, but our service was sub-par. Food was ok.  We waited 45 minutes for our pizza, to which the manager came by and said ""I had them make you a bigger pizza"".  Appreciated, but not necessarily a solution.  My burger was good, but the lettuce, tomato set up was forgotten on my plate.  I was half way finished by the time I got it.  I did like the wedge salad, very fresh. Not really sure if I'd go back.  The overall vibe of the staff was super stressed and unhappy.  I saw one server be extremely rude to his unhappy customer.  Not a very relaxing experience unfortunately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=60

Ranae H.,"Redmond, WA",3,17,16,3.0,9/14/2015,"Just visit the BJ's again with a friend. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, and soups with salads. The dip was good, but the chips were very thin and cover with salt. I had to brush salt off, it was crazy salty. The soup was good, and my waiter noticed that they forgot my bread bowl and immediately got me a new dish with the bread bowl. My friend really enjoyed her tortilla soup and my clam chowder was also very good. The salads were fine, but my friends ceasar was dowsed in dressing.

The food is ok, the honey Brussel sprouts have way to much spicy sauce, and the Bloody Mary isn't good. Also, the root beer wings  were ok. The California flatbread is great. Most likely will not return, but apparently this place is busy usually, so that works out for them. We came because we had never been, and someone gave us a gift card.

Chad A.,"Portland, OR",208,507,5618,4.0,9/25/2013,"W side of N. Center N of N. Jantzen Street on Hayden Island I do not have a problem admitting my fanship to this Pizza Chain at all. I love their diverse and fairly expansive menu that offers food for all moods. I love their brewskies...now there's a shock...(Portlander who loves beer!) My favorites are the Jeremiah Red and the P.M. Porter, but I do enjoy most of them. I've come here both in California and the Portland location many times and mostly for their mini pizzas and to indulge on one of their famous and delicious Pizookies. Their pizzas are sort of a hybrid of what most are used to and a Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza right down to the Corn Meal infused sweeter crust. I love their inventiveness and creativity on some of them pies. If I have room I simply must cram down one of their famous Pizookies which is a choice of a large warm cookie with two scoops of creamy vanilla bean ice cream on top! My eyes roll in the back of my head with every bite. Oh oh back to the pizza. I find them filled with multiple textures and flavors that have my taste buds tingling and my soul warmed. This location is much smaller than what I'm used to, but still offers three types of seating: either booths, regular tables, or up at their bar. Decor is modern and clean and consistent with most other locations. Service has always been kind, patient, and informative which I can totally appreciate. I find their prices to be pretty reasonable for not only being a chain, but also for having such a large menu. There is plenty of parking, but close parking can still prove kind of challenging during busier periods! Their website is well laid out, easily navigable, and informative. I highly recommend checking it out whether you're a rookie or a seasoned pro of BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=60
Sandra M.,"Portland, OR",13,19,,4.0,7/20/2015,"We decided on BJ'S this evening for dinner. We walked in and noticed that the wait staff are happy and energetic. I love the big high backed round booth we sat in. Made for good privacy since we were at the beginning of the dinner rush.  The menu is pretty massive so it took us a bit to take it all in before we ordered. My hubby and I ordered the same thing, which rarely happens. Both of us settled on a roast beef dip sammy. My 10 year old got chicken tenders and my 9year old had cheeseburger sliders. They both had a cookies and cream puzookie for dessert. Our energetic waitress (whos name escapes me ATM damn it I hate when I do that) was knowledgeable on the menu and super sweet. When our dinners arrived, they made kind of a big deal over it by having three of the wait staff bring it to our table and teasing our daughters over who got what which I thought was a sweet thing to do. My sandwich was piled high with moist and tender roast beef. It did have cheese and also some thin sliced caramelized onions and all came on a great baguette.  It also came with some herbed au jus and horseradish for dipping which had great flavor as well. Then some thick cut steak fries. I guess you can pick those or shoestring. Washed it all down with a glass of ice cold Dr. Pepper. My daughters had no complaints and love their puzookie dessert (a puzookie is a hot fresh baked cookie of your choice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a dollop of flavored whipped cream). Next time we come here I will be indulging in one of those. The girls said they were awesome.  Overall it was a pretty good dining experience, from the happy wait staff all the way to dessert. Thanks to you we left happy, full and very satisfied!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=60

ILove Foo D.,"Vancouver, WA",11,95,17,3.0,12/16/2014,"Stopped in for an early dinner while doing some shopping and sat in the bar for happy hour. Small but nicely priced selection of happy hour drinks and food. You can't go wrong with a strawberry mojito for $5. The California flatbread was good, too. Their burgers have small patties which was a bummer. I was so happy to see that they serve clam chowder in a sourdough bowl - I have been searching for a good chowder and sourdough together. The clam chowder was really delicious with large tender pieces of clam that you can bite right through and aren't rubbery at all. They lightly toast the sourdough bowl which I liked. I can't say that it was the best sourdough but it was pretty darn decent.  BJ's offers a nice menu with a good selection. I'm thinking our next visit we will have to try their pizza since we enjoyed the flatbread so much.

Laura D.,"Portland, OR",0,43,,4.0,8/1/2016,"They had a good lighter calorie menu with a variety of options.  The pizookie is what we were truly there for, however, and as always, it was delicious.  Instead of getting the full sized one, we ordered kid's menu pizookies for each of us which were much more reasonably priced, and a great size for each individual to have their own.  The kid ones are only $2.50 each (which is a lot cheaper than getting their trio sampler, which is $10.75 for essentially three kid pizookies.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=60

Anna M.,"Portland, OR",0,10,8,1.0,3/5/2017,"I'm updating my review.   We ordered the Seared Ahi Salad which I loved last time.  The $15.95 salad is described as:  ""Baby field greens, Napa cabbage, romaine and red bell peppers tossed with rice wine vinaigrette. With tomatoes, avocado, pickled cucumber, cilantro, wasabi, crisp wonton strips and green onions."" The salad I saw when I opened the box at home was about half the size of the salad I previously enjoyed, had about half the number of the seared tuna, had a few chunks of tomatoes, maybe a couple slices of red peppers, and absolutely NO AVOCADO, PICKLED CUCUMBER, CILANTRO, GREEN ONIONS OR WASABI. The host was nice as always, and it was busy in there.  However, I paid almost $16 for a salad that wasn't even worth $5. It would be one thing if I ordered it and it contained everything listed on the menu description and I just didn't like it, but to leave out the good stuff? C'mon.  And the avocado egg rolls were somehow tiny and so very lacking compared to previous orders.  These items were a far cry from BJ's back in the day. I've loved this BJ's since I was a kid.  I don't see myself ever going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=20

Rachel B.,"Lahaina, HI",129,14,4,5.0,4/5/2017,"I looooove BJ's! Their pizookies are to die for. I've gone here on multiple occasions just for a pizookie. The triple chocolate Ghirardelli one is my favorite! They also have great food and drinks. An American Moscow mule with strawberry added to it is my drink of choice. It is cheaper to get a pizookie than that drink, though! They also have great deals like $3 pizookies on Tuesdays, as well as $9.95 burgers with unlimited fries on Wednesdays. I didn't know it the first few times I went, but they have their own premiere rewards program. It gives out more free goodies, so you can't go wrong with signing up!

I got the lunch chicken alfredo with a mozzarella and tomato salad. It was fantastic. And for a really good price. The deep dish pizza that my partner got looked delicious too! The service was fantastic and the atmosphere was pretty good. Reminds me of home with all the wood decor. I can't wait to go back so I can try the pizza cookie things that they have for dessert.

Stephen K.,"Damascus, OR",40,166,560,4.0,8/16/2015,"BJ's is a solid restaurant with a HUGE menu.  It is definitely better than The Ram, which is its closest competitor from my experience. Their menu boasts that they are known for their pizzas, but they honestly taste just like they could be bringing them in from Pizza Hut (which is not a good thing). The chicken wings are particularly good, and are done differently here than at most places.  They do not toss the wings in sauce, unless you ask them to.  They drizzle a bit over them for garnish, and serve the sauce on the side. BJ's has a lot of cool ""technological"" things such as a mobile app that lets you place orders, get reward points, and pay at the table. The ambiance is more upscale than one might expect as well.  BJ's gets VERY busy, so call or reserve on-line ahead of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=20

I got a drink, a small bites plate, and a burger for less that $25, which was a surprise considering what I remember prices were a few years ago.

Our server was phenomenal and ensured that we were well taken care of. This BJ's has a pretty good beer selection considering it's located in Portland and has a pretty nice happy hour. Some items on the menu are quite delectable, such as the deep dish pizza. Not to forget about their delicious pizookies. For those of you who are unaware of what a pizookie is, it is a giant freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream. Being a chain there's nothing too special here in particular, but it still is a nice restaurant to go check out if you're in search of a bite to eat and something to drink.

Captain C. Branagain G.,"Astoria, OR",47,576,8,4.0,9/7/2016,"Most chain eateries like this bore me.  Uninspired bar food attempting to be flashy and hip that is priced too high, served by perky co-eds trying to make ends meet.  While BJ's gets lumped in this genre of chains, it does a pretty damn good job at rising above the sea of mediocrity. The menu takes a few weeks to read all of the way through. So many choices that even your picky pain in the ass mates can find culinary satisfaction. We arrived around 9 to be quickly seated.  Service didn't really suffer despite the crowded house, though drink refills seemed to challenge them as far as efficiency was considered..  Mixed drink prices were pretty high, but food prices were in line with the quality. Bottomless chips and salsa was the perfect starter.  Flatbread pizza appetizer was really flavourful.  Kitchen was not as attentive on some special orders, but the server quickly took care of them to our satisfaction. All of our entrees were really good.  The ladies devoured their salted caramel cookie creations as afters.

By 10:30 we decided to leave, we requested our checks.  There was never a sincere apology or reason as to why our food never came out.  The waitress didn't even seem to care.  I would have paid for my food to go, but was never offered a chance.  A manager just said sorry.  Poor service, very disappointing.  Hope they can figure it out and actually care what their customers think.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=20

Holly K.,"Welches, OR",876,483,578,3.0,10/21/2011,"We were starving when we pulled in here, it was lunch time and people were really piling in. I thought for sure we'd have to wait forever, but it turns out, the place is ginormous and we got seated right away. The waitress was really on top of it. We started out with wings, which sort of threw me off, since they were going to rock it all fancy and just add lines of ranch of and buffalo sauce over the top. Like some fancy ice cream sundae. Applause for originality here, but boos for, where the hell is the sauce? I uploaded a picture of them and no I was not drunk when I snapped it, just appears that way. They had an okay flavor, and then I added a Mozzarella salad for $2.95 and was surprised by the the size, the flavor was good. I was feeling pretty hopeful about my selection of shrimp tacos. My son had the cream of broccoli soup, which was pretty good, he gave me the last 1/2 cup of it or so. The small version was pretty large and he said it was getting really rich.  Then they lost their other two yelp stars after that, the shrimp tacos were a major let down. Zip on the flavor and lots of stale chips on the side. Oh, they were pretty reds and blues, but tasted like they'd sat out all week. the shrimp tacos and chips came with two tiny cups of a sauce and salsa, not enough to dip chips, if you even were considering it and barely enough to add to the shrimp to bring em back to life. I asked for extra sauce, and the waitress didn't remember to bring it, and I was pretty much over it by that point.  They are friendly enough, but if I had to do it again, I might have stuck with the lunch special for $5.95, in the picture it looks really small, but we saw them going by and it would have been plenty.

The staff was friendly and attentive throughout and when my glass was half empty there was a full one sitting there waiting.  To top it off we had the triple pizookie for desert.

The pork itself drowned in BBQ sauce was plump and good but that had a weird aftertaste too.. maybe something was wrong with my tastebud? The coleslaw was just horrible to even look at.

The sauce tasted like a mix of soy sauce and high fructose corn syrup, and the egg roll itself had very little flavor. Last, I got a personal deep dish pizza. It was served on a dirty plate rather than its normal cast iron pan. The pizza was cold and the cheese was not melted. The crust was soggy and flavorless.

See my picture.  Husband got the spicy chicken with peanut sauce and soba noodles and said it was all right.  We shared a salted caramel pazookie which was a mooshy, hot cookie with caramel and salted caramel ice cream sprinkled with chocolate chips - that was really good.

We were offered some pizza while we waited and it was average chain pizza. My husband liked it and he doesn't normally like thick crust pizza. I thought it was a bit greasy.  One of the main reasons I liked this place is they have an actual ""Light"" menu that is quite extensive. I got chicken pita tacos and hubby got Mahi Mahi tacos. My daughter and her friend got the angel hair pasta with shrimp. All were great! As someone who has recently just dedicated themselves to losing weight before vacation (aren't we all?), i really appreciated a lighter side.  Drinks. They also had light drinks that were pretty good. I had the guiltless martini and he had the skinny-rita. They might have been light on alcohol, but they tasted good. They seemed to have a really good happy hour too, but we missed it. It ends at 7:00 which is a plus if it takes 45 minutes to be seated.  Overall I was pretty impressed and I was really surprised.

Then, we come to Portland, which is the Mecca of micro breweries, and all the breweries here also have tons of great food.  There were other non chain breweries in Houston, but they didn't operate as brewpubs and were set up mainly for tours with samplings of their beers and that was it.   I actually did visit the BJs in Jantzen Beach, and it was a very subpar experience.  The beer was very flat...the waiter questioned me like maybe I didn't know what I was talking about, but I sent back for another type of beer.  This was also flat.  Then I got to thinking that maybe the lines were dirty or something.  It just tasted bad.  I am familiar with nutty brunette and Jeremiah red, and loved them back in Houston but they both tasted really off and flat. The food was ok, but nothing to write home about.  I got my standard parmasean crusted chicken and it was just ok.  I personally think BJs might not do so well here because of all the great local brewpubs, which makes me a little sad because I used to really love it.  I probably won't go back to this BJs but I will most likely visit one when I return to visit Houston!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=140

The server didn't even ask us about the salad that was supposed to come with our meals, I figured she'd just bring them. Salads never came. My friends soup bowl never came, nor did the veggies that were to go along with my son's kids meal. We didn't even bother about the salads at that point. The server said they had to make the soup, which is why it was late. Odd. must have been some sort of can or boxed soup.   After the server brought the check and took the card, she never came back. We waited almost 15 minutes for someone to walk by and notice us. We needed Togo boxes.  While the food was okay-- the beers were good, but the missing food and lack of apologetics makes me give this a three stars.

Kimiko F.,"Vancouver, WA",28,23,4,2.0,5/9/2016,"Came in for Mothers Day, expecting that all dining places would be busy... Unfortunately even expecting longer than normal service didn't prepare us for the 2 1/2 hour waiting game.  My mother in law wanted to dine here because of the Avocado rolls. Unfortunately they added spicy peppers or made them more predominant in the recipe because she could barely finish one.  The stuffed mushrooms were great (along with the monkey bread pizookie), but that is where our satisfaction ended.  First, either our server had been working a double or has incredibly short memory. The table next to us asked for a lime for a drink 3 times (after the initial drink order) before she actually brought it over.  We ordered appetizers, and no plates, napkins or utensils were brought till we asked for them.  My daughter ordered orange juice but it was too tart for her so we asked for another water... Over the next 2 hours, the waitress refilled our drinks, brought our food and never brought the water despite being asked no less than 6 times for another water to be brought to the table.  As a former waitress, I try to be understanding, but she seemed to be in lala land. We also were casually talking about birthing stories since I'm expecting my second child, and she chimes in with a 3 minute story about herself (and still forgot the water).  Admittedly, I asked for a modified menu item, so I was expecting an upcharge or possible confusion. I ordered a seared ahi salad, but since I don't like seared ahi but wanted the salad (which they don't sell on its own ala cart), I asked to substitute seared ahi for the poke. They brought out the salad with raw, unseasoned fish (fish cubes). Poke is a Japanese item that is popular in Hawai'i (where I'm from) that is traditionally sesame oil, soy sauce, sea salt, green onions and other flavors with raw ahi tune cubes.  The first time I sent it back, they brought it back supposedly coated in sauce. Tried a piece and was definitely still just raw fish no seasoning.  We asked for a manager and I explained that if the substitution was not possible I'd order something else. He took it back and actually had the ahi poke made according to the recipe for the appetizer (which is what I expected the first time).  The burgers that my husband and brother in law had were overcooked. And everything seemed priced $5-15 over other establishments that make better food.  Unfortunately, unless I'm craving stuffed mushrooms or monkey bread (Cinnabon is better), we will probably not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=40

They left the table next to us full of the dirty plates and glasses from the people who were sitting there for about 15 minutes. Then one person came and grabbed the plates, another person came and got the cups and cleaned the table half ass. Then the hostess had to come clean the table and seats because the 2nd person did a terrible job. So it took them 20 minutes to get that table ready for another group to sit down.

Warren C.,"Portland, OR",115,221,5,2.0,8/15/2011,"BJ's has never really ever been something for me to ever write home about but my friend Genell was insistent on coming over here for a meal this evening.  As we arrived to the restaurant we chose to be seated at the bar and was immediately greeted by Lindey our server/bartender. We started off with a couple of appetizers which were the Calamari and the Ahi Poke and two peach margaritas.   First off the Margaritas were very tart and even my friend Genell which is a bartender agreed with me as well. Her suspicions was it might have been too much mix.  The Calamari was a bit dry and the oil it was cooked in needed to be replaced. I know from my experiences with my parents owning a restaurant that you need to leave some of the old oil to give fried food some of the color needed when things are fried. The coating tasted burnt. This comes with either Marinara or a Lemon Garlic Aoli. The marinara did not go well with the Calamari and the Aoli was really just ranch. The Ahi Poke was really good considering this was made by mainlanders! The Ahi was tender to the touch and they did not skimp and buy cheap Tuna. This was mixed with avocado's and served with won ton chips which really looked more like tortilla chips to be honest with you. After finishing these two orders we couldn't really decide what to have for the meal so we decided to continue going with appetizers and ordered the Bruschetta and a Tomato and Mozzarella salad which is basically a Caprese salad.  The Bruschetta was good but there was one thing that seemed to make this appetizer a bit difficult. It was the size of the foccacia bread. The slices were literally an 1 1/4 inch thick. I joked with Genell that they sliced up texas toast because they were out of foccacia.  The tomato mixture was really good and the pesto vinagrette accented the flavors really well. As for the Tomato and Mozzarella salad. Everything was very fresh. The Mozzarella was very tender but diced up in cubes as opposed to the traditional slices. The basil was very fresh and opened up your palate to an array of other flavors. I would definitely order the salad again.  Overall, I wasn't really impressed but I wasn't disappointed either. Our bartender was very attentive and asked us at one point how everything was and I thought it was fair that I at least speak out about the qaulity of our appetizers. She paid attention and listened to what I had to say. We even had a manager come up and ask us what we felt was wrong. I made it clear to the manager that I did not want to be comped but wanted them to be aware of the mistakes that were made. He was very friendly and apologized for the mistakes.  The total to the bill came out to almost 60 bucks. This is for four appetizers, two margaritas, two glasses of wine and a cup of coffee. It seemed a bit steep but I think it was more the sting of the mistakes that were made that left a sour taste in my mouth.  I wouldn't steer anyone away from this place but I will say not to expect a whole lot either. For the money I would of rather gone somewhere else. I want to give you 3 stars but I can't morally justify it after my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=180

My only problem is my hatred for unprocessed tomatoes, and they put them on nearly every pizza, but one could always just ask for no tomatoes. They really know how to take care of their customers here. We had a long wait for our pie once, then it came out with the wrong stuff on it. The waitress ordered us a new one, and about 2 minutes later the manger came by and took the pie off our tab. He didn't have to do that, but I was appreciative.

Alan W.,"Portland, OR",3,1,,3.0,1/25/2015,"DW and I thought it would be a nice idea to grab a pizza and a salad, then head down to the dock and eat them on our small boat.   I used a YELP search to find out that there was a BJ's Pizza on Hayden Island - perfect.   This was on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed - not just a few extra people, but hoards of people waiting for a table.  This must be a testament to BJ's fine food.  We quickly settled on a Margherita Fresca pizza, a Golden Beet and Arugula salad, and the crispy Calamari - all from the take out menu.   Our order was taken immediately, but took 25 minutes to arrive, which is not surprising considering that it was apparently Prime Time for food at BJ's.   The take out bag full of food was a light as a feather - even with all the packing boxes, napkins and plastic cutlery.   Turns out, this really was a lunch just barely good enough for one person, and we are not 'big eaters'.   With a tip, this lunch cost 25 bucks.   The salad was small but delicious.  The crispy Calamari was also very good, as were the two dipping sauces that came with the dish.   The pizza was unimpressive and as far from Italy as you can get.  Turns out, we had unwittingly ordered the 'appetizer pizza.'    Sadly, there wouldn't be any leftovers for lunch the next day.   When I go to BJ's again, I will set my expectations for good food, small servings and high prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-portland?start=180

(And they gave us buffalo wings instead of bbq wings).  We also ordered the gluten free pizza and first, it's smaller than a medium pizza (D-Dish doesn't tell you that, just that it's costing you $14.50) you'd think with FIVE toppings it'd be covered in food but it was a scraping of tomato sauce and such sparse toppings you could see the bare crust.  Horrible horrible waste of money.

The food was pretty average, similar to what you would get at applebees.  I got a California burger, which was good, but nothing worth remembering.

The menu has a pretty large selection, which can make it difficult but only because everything is so tasty! My favorites are most definitely the Maui glazed pork chop and the peanut butter smores pizooki. Neither dish sounded like something I would typically go for but the Maui pork chop has an amazing spice in it that gives it a delicious kick and the smores pizooki is a great way to end a wonderful dining experience!

Favorites include the clam chowder, cherry glazed salmon, not fresh pacific salmon, but at $14.95 I don't expect that. Also like the beef dip and jambalaya. The jambalaya is not as spicy as some would like, but it's just right for me. Salads are average, so I go for their vegetables that always seem to be cooked just right. One of my new favorites is the Mediterranean peta tacos. Very tasty, cheap, filling and low fat and low calories. I eat here about once a week with either my mother who is 89 years old or my wife.

Also, if you like beers such as bud light, coors light, etc... they don't have those, so your best bet is to order their ""House Blonde"" beer. It's the lightest beer you'll get there and it tastes so similar to coors. They have the BEST cookie and ice cream desserts.

Warm chocolate brownie, chocolate ice cream, and Gherideli chocolate, as a big chocolate fan, I was in heaven. Happy hour half price mini pizzas allowed me to experiment with the flavors, saw a variety of food go by that I really wanted to reach out and sample. I will be back.
