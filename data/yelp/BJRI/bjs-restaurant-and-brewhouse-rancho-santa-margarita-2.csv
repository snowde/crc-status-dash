Katie S.,"Westminster, CA",20,8,1,1.0,9/20/2017,Just disappointed....for how pricey the food and drinks are our services was not great. The beginning started out fine but then our server just left....didn't tell us...and had no one else come check on us. After a while of me looking around and looking at other servers I finally had to get up and go find someone just so I could pay my bill and leave. Not happy about spending as much money as I did to have such slow bad service....Probably won't be back to this location,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=20
Jeanne L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",23,48,14,4.0,8/28/2017,I love that it is possible to have a table conversation without strain to hear or shouting.  The food is good for the price.  Jeremiah Red is a great beer choice. We don't go out often but this is a nice place to meet up with a couple friends and enjoy the evening. I did call for reservations early in the week for 6:45 Friday and we only had to wait about 5 minutes for the text that the table was ready.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=20
Mary D.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",7,8,,1.0,8/19/2017,"We have eaten here several times. Today's experience started with menus that were filthy and smelled. When you watched the front desk, you could understand why. A lot of gossip between 3 employees and no work being done. After asking server twice, we got wet naps to clean our hands. There was no way I could eat without wet naps and I told our server why. She apologized and said she would tell manager. We'll never know since no one stopped by. My husband's order was brought out 3 times before they brought the correct order. The food was good but the atmosphere and sanitation was definitely lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=20

After going there couple of times, I now feel why would this place has low ratings. Service is slow and food is below average, not sure why it's not of a same standard as other locations that we previously visited, even thou BJ's is a big chain.

Comedy P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,192,315,4.0,6/29/2016,"Fist I'd like to thank Manager Hector (before I forget his name) for his extended customer service!  I came in on a Tuesday around 12:40pm. Busy lunch hour and the last day of the ""Free Pizookies"". I went to place an ""order to go"".  I ordered the lunch size Lemon Thyme Chicken and the Roasted Chicken & Spinach. And I got my first Pizookie (Chocolate Chunk).  My wait was around 30 mins (It was busy) and I was offered something to drink while I wait. I declined....... But it was 93 degrees outside, I should have said ""Yes"". LOL   My order was ready...... And my ice cream was placed in the bag with the hot food. Most places place it in a small separate bag. I took it out and carried it in my hand.  The food was delicious. I'm not sure if my Pizookie was supposed to be cooked on the outside and like cookie dough inside; even on the edges..... I placed it in my toaster oven to cook it a bit more. That was a better consistency.  So, great food, awesome customer service.  And I'll have to come during Happy Hour. They have it twice a day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=20

Couldn't even eat it!  Been here several times before and 2 out of 3 experiences were horrible. 1 time there was hair in my food. Another time my boyfriend and I came in we only had 1 fork at the table and no one stopped to check on us. We literally had to take turns eating.

Erin V.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/31/2017,"I placed an order using the BJ's app which I was very excited about. It was easy to use and I received an email indicating that my food would be ready at the RSM restaurant at 6:45pm. I arrived with my 2 young sons at 6:45pm to pick up our food and the girl at the takeout counter indicated that they never received my order. I showed her my emailed receipt and she said they never received that order and told me she'd have to place my order again. I also mentioned to her that on the back counter, there were drinks that looked like what I had ordered, but she said they were someone elses. My sons and I waited over half an hour for the new order and when they called me up, I asked the server if the food she was packaging up was fresh and had not been sitting in the warmers since 6:45pm (my original pick up time). She said yes, that she had just gotten them from the kitchen. I agreed to take the food based on the premise that it was fresh. I left at about 7:30pm. I got home about 2 minutes later with my sons and as I was unpackaging the food, I discovered that the food was time stamped 6:26pm which would have been the time that it was prepared for my original pick up time at 6:45pm. The food was cold, my boys wouldn't eat it, and I believe the drinks they handed to me were the ones that had been sitting on that back counter and therefore watered down. I called the restaurant to express my complaint about the service and they indicated that a manager would call me back since they were slammed. I appreciated that, however, its been 2 days with no call back. I haven't been able to get a hold of the Manager. What upsets me the most about this is the fact that the server lied to me and I caught her with the time stamp. This is unacceptable service. So... according to the RSM restaurant, the app doesn't work because they never received my order... or did they?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=20

On multiple occasions I have experienced poor service at this location. These have occurred when I was with a large group. If you have more than 4 people, go elsewhere. The beer is great.

Our food was just delish and the candied salmon is just the best thing on the menu. They did run out of couscous and substituted rice instead and I missed the couscous. But the rice was ok. And because of the substitution they gave us a pizookie on the house. That is the way a restaurant should be. They took care of us.  Michael was an excellent waiter. Very attentive and super nice.  We came back and had a wonderful dinner. I again ordered my favorite meal the chipotle cherry salmon. BEST THING EVER. Our server Morgan was amazing and so efficient. We had the best service.

I accidentally spilled a glass of water on the table and he was quick to help clean it and get new napkins for us. (Sorry about the spill!!) Great customer service.

I've always liked their micro brewed beers, but I wish they carried other craft beers from the awesome selection we have in So Cal. They have a large menu, but I usually stick with their pizzas said since there's is different from most of the pizza places in So Cal. While it's not real Chicago style pizza, it does have a great taste. I like the BJ's Favorite, which is basically a combo supreme.

Andrew G.,"Sparks, NV",183,93,938,2.0,9/23/2015,Well I have to follow in the same line as my fellow yelpers. Not the best experience at a BJs. They usually rank pretty high but this location is not up to par. Let's start with the positive experience. My 5 year old nephew accidentally spilled his water all over the table and a busser who was cleaning up a table close by came right over and helped clean it up. Nothing out of the ordinary with this gesture but extremely friendly. After he finished drying off our table he came over to my nephew and said all dry! Gave him a high five and said nothing to worry about buddy! This made my nephew night and he was taken from upset to happy. Really nice touch by the busser and the best service provided. The food took a long time to get after we ordered. Wasn't overly busy so not sure why it took so long. We ordered avocado rolls for an appetizer and had it half way eaten before our drinks arrived. My brother n law wished he had a straw to make the empty cup noise because we were left empty majority of the dinner. Our waiter was friendly and nice. He did his best to be attentive to our table but the overall experience really was 1.5 stars. I did give them a half of star for the awesome busser. Like my fellow yelpers have mentioned it's really a disappointment to have such a brand named restaurant that doesn't upkeep the name. It's in a nice area where service is key.    You have be warned!

Wally P.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",155,137,948,1.0,9/3/2014,"Wow! This was the worst service ever. Even our waiter and the manager were embarrassed and apologetic at how pathetic they were today. Though they gave us a discount, I am still compelled to give an honest description of their failures today. 1) my family party of 5 arrived at 1 pm today and the house was only 1/4 full. Despite the many empty tables, we waited 15 minutes for a table. Two other parties of 3 were seated before us. How mad would you be? 2) once seated we waited another 10 minutes to see our waiter and place an order. He was clearly overwhelmed and apologetic for the delay. We were cooperative and sympathetic. 3) waited another 20 minutes before one salad was served. We asked where our drinks and the rest of order was. She said she'd check. 4) another 10 minutes and nothing. We flag our waiter who is appalled we have no drinks or other food yet. 5) another 10 minutes and the rest of our food arrives. But still no drinks. Again we inquire about the drinks. They finally arrive AFTER we finish our meal. I ask for a pizza server and some silverware but it never comes.  6) the waiter flags manager at his own suggestion. He explains how overwhelmed he is, and though we are annoyed, we understand. 7) manager comps us drinks and pizzookie, and explains why our table was not supposed to be assigned to him, yada, yada. Yeah it all makes sense, but honestly all I wanted was an efficient meal with my family. That should not be hard to fulfill on a particularly slow day. 8) it's now 2:30 and hour and a half after we checked in. We had a pizza, salad, and pizzookie. The discounted bill was the least they could do.  But then I noticed a ""fruit plate"" charged to my bill that I did not order.

As I was attending the Smith concert at the park, I thought I could just go there and grab something delicious to take out... I order fish tacos. however, it occurred to me that I would much prefer if it was wrapped in flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas.Simple request... The ""gentleman"" at the register replied "" NO"" it can't be done, Every customer gets the same"" Short and rude!( this was witnessed by a friendly and professional female attendant) I was shocked! Even more, because the rude man turns out to be Kenny Fahrer, the manager!!!!  I use to like the Bj's in Anaheim Hils, however, this one in Rancho Santa Margarita left a disastrous impression on me.Certainly not a place I recommend to anyone, certainly not a place I would be back to. My take out fish tacos were dark, (clearly made with old oil) more burned dough than fish, they didn't have the finesse to put napkins or silverware in the take out bag...Needless to say, it went all straight to the trash can at the park.

Kimberly W.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",180,53,22,1.0,1/10/2017,"Okay, this is the second time in the last two months that we have come here and the service and food quality wasn't up to par. Everything was rushed. From our conversation with our service to our food being brought out to us. I felt like we were in competition of our seats.  We order the sample platter first and told the service we're on a date night, excited to go on vacation this weekend. She didn't seems really interest in us, but to tell us she just got back from her vacation and that she finished school and graduation. She continue to tell us she usually works at the bar, but likes to waitress sometimes as well. She didn't write down out order, which I thought was impressive, but then came back because she forgot twice what we order. Humm write it down then. She just was all over the place. Once we ordered the sample platter it would of been a little nice to know that it was enough for four people instead of two. Waste of food and I should of taken a picture of it- but I forgot. We wouldn't have gotten it. The only thing cooked on the platter was the avocado eggrolls and mozzarella sticks. The Spanish dip was awful and the buffalo wings weren't even dipped all the way. Then we order a mini pizza/salad to share and wine/beer and she forgot my wine the second time around. The mini pizza wasn't cooked and the cheese wasn't melted at all.  The bottom wasn't crispy like the deep dish we usually get.  Also it didn't come in the deep dish pan like as we order. Maybe this has changed now they served on a plate. IDK She did say sorry and did send it back. The second pizza came out and it was just as bad. It looked like they just reheated it. The reason why you only see two slices in the picture is because we're splitting it and as you can see it's gross. I couldn't eat it. The manager did come by and take the mini pizza off our bill but it's not worth us going back again for any reason. This isn't the first time this has happened, but it's my first time noting it here. I have no idea what's going on with this place, it used to be pretty good.  I rather spend a little extra and get better service and food quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=60
Michele K.,"Irvine, CA",535,310,475,2.0,10/25/2016,"Tried to be adventurous today and somewhat ""health"" conscious and got the lemon thyme chicken off of their enlightened menu. Huge Huge Huge mistake. The only person I really have to blame is myself though. I think one would expect an ""enlightened"" menu to be somewhat healthy... but then again... you shouldn't have high expectations at a place like BJs. Yes, yes, the lemon thyme chicken is only 510 calories... but then when you look at the rest of the nutritional facts... It's 1990mg of sodium... which is 83% of the daily recommended intake... 100mg of cholesterol... 33% of the daily recommended intake....18g of fat... 100% of the daily recommended intake. For the amount of calories taken in... that's a lot of sodium. It's not just about the calories, yall. The other nutritional facts are important too! I'm not sure what this dish is supposed to be like, but there was a lot of lemon thyme sauce. It was almost like a stew, everything was drenched in it. The brown rice was really mushy and almost had no texture to it (which is surprising since brown rice has more texture than white rice). Everything else kind of got lost in the swamp of lemon thyme sauce.. which I think was the sodium culprit. The sauce was so salty and I was tilting my plate to one side in attempts to keep the rest of the food dry. Next time I return to BJs for a work lunch, I'll be sticking with the safe options.. like a caesar salad... or something...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=60

My boyfriends salmon plate was a little overcooked, but who orders salmon from BJ's??? He's silly and on a little health kick.  A pazookie is a must right!?!!

I've given this place a few chances already but it is always subpar compared to the other location. Pros: Seating was quick. Pizza was good. Cons: The side salad was small. half the size of the one at the Laguna Hills location. Not only was it small, it didn't taste fresh. It was ice cold.. like it came out of the freezer. It did not have the fresh crunch that you would expect from some fresh greens. Disappointing. The ribs looked nice but was tougher in texture. I expect that if I am going to pay over $20 for ribs, it should be nice and tender, peeling off the bone texture. Unfortunately, this one was not. If I want to go to BJ's, it will definitely be at the other location from here on out.

I was skipped. They left, not asking if everyone was good. Staff likes to hang out at their cubbies and the bar more than wait on guests. When they finally did come back around I asked where my personal size pizza was. My friend also had a overly undercooked guacamole burger. They took his burger back. They were absent for another 5 mins. I asked a second time about my pizza. There was no apology or indication that this was already on their radar. In fact they ask, oh you're waiting on your pizza? They came back and brought my friends burger back. It was literally thrown back on the plate and there was no longer any guacamole. I asked again about my pizza and asked if I could get a side of skinny fries (since I was really hungry at this point). They came back 5 mins later with the skinny fries. Still no pizza. By now our entire table is done eating. I asked them for the manager at this point. 10 mins later everyone has been done eating for a while now I ask for my pizza one last time. They came back in 2 mins now with the pizza. We were all done eating still waiting for the manager. Manager happened to walk by just to ask how things were going to all the tables and this was the first her heard that we requested him.  I told him about our experience.

To be fair, we have dined in BJs on many occasions and the food has always (until today) been tasty.  You guys had a bad day with us today.  BTW, the meal that my lady ordered was fine with no problems but since we were on a date, I have to award BJs only one star today.  For us, todays experience was a total waste of time and money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=60

On Wednesday the money still hadn't appeared in our account.

Angie M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",159,1230,4826,3.0,2/17/2014,"Let me start by saying my review would have been a 1, had it not been for the manager, Art. I met my parents here for dinner Saturday night... called ahead and had our name added to the wait list for 6pm.  We arrived at 6, there were maybe a dozen or less people waiting in the front area.  We were the last to be seated, which... really, in my opinion... we were seated at 6:05 it wasnt really a big deal. I really wish I knew the name of our waitress.  She was slower than molasses running uphill on a cold January morning.   She asked for our drink order... my Dad asked what non BJs beers they had on tap. She wasnt sure, so she said she would find out.  About 10 minutes later she came back with a list.  About 20 minutes after that, he got his beer. Like I said, we sat down at 6:05.  My Dad ordered a Roast Beef Dip, my Mom ordered a Top Sirloin Steak, Medium (pink) with a wedge salad and a baked potato, and I ordered the Top Sirloin Steak Medium Well with a wedge salad with ranch, and rice pilaf. Around 7:00pm, my Dad asked another waitress to please ask the manager to come to our table.  We still did not have our food.  The food arrived just as the manager got to our table, and he told us to let him know how the steaks were.  He said it was a second round, the first round he told the waitress was not acceptable to take out to our table.  I let him know we both ordered the same steak, yet there were two different steaks on our table.  He said he would go ahead and just take both steaks off our bill, and he would include a free dessert for us.  It turns out I had the Top Sirloin and my Mom had the Rib-Eye which tends to have a bit more fat on it, so she was bummed about that.  My moms steak on top being wrong had the wrong side. I also don't understand why if the first round of steaks weren't acceptable to be sent out, how come no one told us?  Not a word.  Our waitress asked us if we wanted dessert, and we informed her the manager said he was going to take care of it.  She was confused by this, so we told her to just go talk to him.  Dessert took another half hour for a simple pazookie.  In the end, we sat at our table from 6:05pm to 8:05pm for a simple dinner.  It was so long, and so slow... it was almost painful. When anything was brought out to our table, it was brought out by someone who was not our server.  The restaurant was pretty full, but definitely had empty tables, and in my opinion had no reason to have us there TWO hours for dinner. What bothers me on top of everything else, is our waitress didnt once apologize.  She was not friendly, she was so incredibly slow and was just clueless in general.  Honestly it was the worst service I think I have ever experienced.  Anywhere.  Ever. I will give my review three stars, because in my opinion the manager, Art, handled everything top notch.  He came to our table and offered to take our food off the bill, and free dessert before we even had a chance to complain.  He was great.  The waitress, was horrific, which is why I just decided to settle in the middle at 3 stars. 5 stars for Art. 0 stars for our waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=80

Staff is friendly and seems well trained (I don't believe any of our servers have deserved anything less than 20%) compared to other locations.  I just tried their new magnolia peach beer- sweet, but not too sweet. I love their seared ahi salad for lunch and hubby and I tend to always get a large deep dish pizza to go! We've also recently enjoyed their boneless wings, although I think they could be coated in sauce better. Tomato mozzarella salad is always phenomenal and I love their stuffed spinach mushrooms.

Daniel P.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,38,1,1.0,10/31/2016,"I have a love-hate relationship with BJ's: The food is always delicious but the service can range from anywhere between good and completely unacceptable. Tonight was one of those unacceptable times. Essentially, they can't handle doing Curbside take-out. Two employees came out at separate times to ask for my name to grab my order, then left me waiting way too long before I went inside to try to pick up my food. At one point, they claimed that even though they both came out to check on me, it got busy. Apparently BJ's training teaches them that when it gets busy, you ignore your curbside customers that have been there longer than the folks who walk in to get their food. It took over 20 minutes to actually pay for and receive my order that was already fully prepared when I first arrived. My recommendation to both BJ's and other potential customers: Just say no to Curbside take-out. -------------- Update 11/11/2016: I originally wrote the above and gave it a 2 star review. At the same time I wrote the review, I also sent in my comments to BJ's corporate. I didn't receive a true apology at the restaurant and it's now been over 8 business days and I haven't received a true apology from their corporate office either. All I was hoping for was a genuine ""we're sorry, we messed up and we'll try to do better next time"" but it seems that's asking too much. If they don't care enough about me to even acknowledge my experience, then I don't feel they deserve any of my respect either. I am docking this down to a 1-star review for continued poor customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=80

He never came to check on us or even bother to see if everyone had their food.  We requested to speak to a manager, when she came over she did not even apologize for their poor service and food. She said it was busy for them and that is what happens. What??? When is it ok to have poor service and food and make your customers pay for it?

And peach time the order came out wrong.  The times I have been in the place was not busy enough to justify the poor service. One time there were only three other tables seated and what seemed to be excessive staff to client ratio.   I would hate to see a business close in our town those are needed jobs, and we need a great place to come and eat.  But management is not properly working this location.  The manager never seems to be present, and the staff is failing due to this.  Please pull it together I have eaten here several times with months in between visits to give it one more chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=100

My...it's very rare for me to have some food hit the spot just right. The salad was something I needed in my diet because I have a hard time incorporating veggies and healthy options into my foods.

He enjoyed it a lot which means I have a DD if he'll come here for the burger -evil laugh- They didn't have American cheese, so he opted for cheddar.  Other person in our party got a glass of Guinness to start (because the day before St. Paddy's day, you can't go wrong with this choice) and some food....hmm......what did he get? I can't remember. I think he also tried to order one of the BJ's stouts but the waiter never brought it to him and didn't ring it through on the computer so he skipped on it because we were done with our food. There was only one mistake on our bill at the end of the meal. A pizza that was on a HH was brought up as $10 instead of the $6. It was promptly fixed without a hassle and our waitress apologized. We had to give the bill to someone else to fix because she wasn't around and we couldn't find her.  All in all, I keep coming back here because of HH and the location.

Well when we were finally sat down 10 minutes later, the server took forever to get to us and take an order for drinks, probably close to 20  minutes. Then the drinks took a long time to arrive, like another 20 for one water and one pepsi. She then took our food order.  My bf and I split the 9"" buffalo chicken pizza and a bacon and blue burger. The bacon and blue burger came split in half since that's what I asked for. However, the burger was so poorly assembled that all the bacon was on one half of the burger and not the other. I had to go in and redistribute the bacon. Also, it's suppose to have blue cheese, but there was no blue cheese at all. They put in too little blue cheese to call it that.  The buffalo chicken pizza is weird tasting. The crust has a taste of artificial butter. My boyfriend even said ""it tastes like movie theater popcorn butter."" That's disgusting! The cheese they use on the pizza is low quality as well, it hardens in a matter of seconds and they don't use enough on the pizza. The crust wasn't crispy either, which is what I expect from a deep dish pie made with a proper cornmeal crust. Just awful, all of it.  I hated everything about this place.

Marco M.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/19/2017,"Just came back after having dinner at BJ's in Rancho Santa Margarita.  This is the first time I have been to this location, after having been a BJ's customer at other locations, but mostly in Laguna Hills.  The waitress was fantastic, and it is out of respect to her that I did not raise hell.  After ordering our dinner including my wife's who is gluten intolerant (we stressed this to the waitress at least five times and who assured us that she will convey the allergy to the cook and manager), they brought in the gluten-free hamburger contaminated with french fries which have wheat and are not gluten-free.  They apologized and assured us that they will make a new one.  Regardless of what they did, my wife had a reaction after we got home, which only means that her meal was contaminated with gluten.  My daughter's chicken salad had to be ordered twice but our biggest disappointment was the dip-dish pizza.  It was extremely dry, analogous to eating dry bread with very dry chicken, dry mushrooms and dry black olives (our toppings).  Hardly any cheese and skimpy tomato sauce.  The worst dip-dish pizza I have ever had.  It was definitely one of the worst dinners we have ever had.  On our way out of the restaurant, a gentleman asked us if everything was alright.  It was the Manager.  Nicely, I told him that the pizza is not what we expected from BJ's.  He acknowledged my comments and asked if he can do something to make it right.    I am not the type who complains  with the intent of getting a free meal.  I thanked him by saying no!  The reason I am giving the 1 Star is for the waitress who was definitely great.  The cooks get a ZERO!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=120

Dr W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,4,1.0,12/30/2015,"Yesterday, we visited my wife's mother and took her out for lunch. It was not good. There was no one at the hostess station when we came in, but a few minutes later we did get seated. We made some selections on the menu, and I ordered a Corona beer (they didn't have it..), so I settled for a Miller Lite ($4).  What California restaurant does *not* serve Corona, a very popular Mexican beer? The water brought to the table had some strange small particles floating in the water. The silverware placed on the table was dirty, and spotted, even wrapped in a black cloth napkin. They need to fix the dish washer machine or do quality control better. The food came. I had a soup (chili) and salad (Caesar). They did not bring any bread or crackers, so I asked for some. Waitress brought two little bags of oyster crackers. The chili tasted like canned chili, the salad was ok. My wife's mother's soup was cold, not hot, and had to be sent back to the kitchen to be re-warmed. We only saw the waitress rarely, never asked how things were. My wife's pasta dish (chicken alfredo) had a hair on the bowl side, so we asked them to re-do it. It came after a bit. On the check, they overcharged us for the lunch pasta dish my wife had, and we didn't notice until we left. It's supposed to be $9.50 and they charged us $15.50. Terrible experience, it was between lunch and dinner, but just never will go here again.

I order a simple scrambled eggs and well done bacon.  I ask for no potatoes or toast with my meal as I cannot eat them.   I order an ice tea and they bring me water.  The eggs taste like they were cooked in a dirty, rancid pan or something gone really bad, the bacon was raw, and there was a big pile of potatoes on the plate. Seriously, how can you screw up scrambled eggs and bacon. Unless you want a drink at the bar, stay away, stay very far away.

This BJ's gets surprisingly really crowded, probably because Rancho Santa Margarita is not swimming with an excess of lots of restaurants. I say that with love - I went to junior high and high school in the area so I know. I would've loved this place in high school - would've been a spot I sat at with all my friends and didn't order much on weekend nights after football games.  The food - if you've been to a BJ's before, you'll know. Giant, pretty delicious deep dish pizzas. Pretty solid in terms of what you can get in California deep dish pizza wise (though Chicago-ans would scoff). I try to stay away from those most days unless I'm splurging. What I've been getting recently when I go (because it's one of not too many options for a sit-down dinner in RSM) is the Ahi salad. It's on the Light & Lean or Weight Management or something like that menu but is actually pretty delicious. Solid Ahi and lots of avocado - two of my favorite things. I usually top that off with a seasonal beer and call it a meal :)  Pizzookies are delicious for dessert. Again, don't go near them most days due to trying to eat healthy.

If they are busy, don't even go in, the service will be very slow and you're going to be disappointed. One time they took an hour to get my daughter her gluten free pizza, I guess they kept giving it to other people.  We've come a few times when it's been busy, it's always been slow and frustrating.  When it isn't busy, service has been great! Food is good, pretty quick also. Maybe they just need better management when it comes to the busy times.  Our favorite foods are the wings, love the really spicy ones, and they are REALLY spicy!! Gluten free pizza and pizookie is absolutely amazing!!

Minus the awesome bartenders and BJ's premier rewards, there aren't a whole lot of redeeming qualities. Food always takes a long time to come out and in most cases something is wrong. The food is also never consistent! We ordered a pizookie and timed it - it took 45 minutes before I finally asked about it. The bartender told me they gave the pizookie to the wrong table. Weird because we were at the bar. They brought us out a new one 5 minutes later and that one WAS completely raw. So frustrating. Management and the kitchen need to figure it out!

Janelle J.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",922,393,931,4.0,11/15/2017,"Came in on  a Tuesday for lunch with a friend right at 11am opening. We specifically planned to come to BJ's on a Tuesday because they have the special 1/2 price wine and champagne (we got mini champagne bottles for $4.30 ish) and $3 pazookis. When we walked in, I expected to smell cleaning products because they had just opened, but to my surprise we smelled yummy food! I was instantly appetized.  We both ordered one of their lunch specials, a mini pizza 1 topping & salad for $10.95 and an order of buffalo wings ($11.95 ish)  We were pleased that it came with a salad and were excited to dig in! The wedge salad was great, and I ordered the garden salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. The balsamic was amazing, next time I will get a large salad because of the amazing dressing, The pizza was a bit doughy for my liking, I was more into the salad and champagne. Also, the pizza came with chopped up tomatoes on top of my pepperoni, I was a little confused because I did not order chunks of tomatoes, but thats okay because they were good anyway. Be weary of this if you are not a tomato eater. Ohhhh our boneless hot wings appetizer.... Not as good as other places, and they were expensive! Stick to the avocado egg rolls for appetizer instead. Loved how the champagne was served in mini bottles! It pours about 2 glasses and is not flat because it was in an unopened bottle. I asked for a side of orange juice to make mine a mimosa and they waitress brought it right away at no extra charge. My pazooki recommendation  is their classic, chocolate chunk. I order mine well done because I don't like the oozing batter. I suggest ordering your pazooki about 10 minutes before you want it at your table because they have to cook for a bit. Our server was great, I'm sad I didn't get her name to mention it in this review because she was so nice.

It was more on the sour side than sweet. To eat I just ordered some mozzarella sticks. When we got our plates and silverware our plates were still wet and a little dirty. I had to wipe down my plate.  We got our appetizers after a little bit of a wait. My mozzarella sticks weren't that bad. They were nice and stringy. They could of been a little more crispy though. My Dad got chicken wings with buffalo and ranch sauce on the side. They were alright, a little on the greasy side. My Mom got their chicken potstickers. The filling was kinda dry, but the soy sauce helped. I liked the wonton wrapper part though. It was crisp on one side and soft on the other.

Ashley C.,"Laguna Beach, CA",486,67,90,4.0,10/24/2017,"I have been coming to BJs since I could remember. Back in the day I would come here for their thick deep dish pizza and the chocolate chip pazooki. Now that I am gluten free, I have gotten a little more adventurous with their menu. The stuffed baked potato and salmon are a great option when I'm not craving pizza. Onto their pizza for those of us who are gluten free...  Pros:  -Gluten Free Pizza Dough  Cons:  -Not our standard delicious deep dish pizza  -Personal size options only  -Very thin crust  As for the deep dish pizza my boyfriend ordered, he was very disappointed that it wasn't a true Chicago style deep dish where toppings are layered ok thick with a ton of cheese, the pizza was just mostly bread with a small amount of cheese and they were very stingy on the toppings.

Jane R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",42,109,257,2.0,2/11/2017,"I go to this branch quite often for beer & wings.  Always sit in the bar as there's always a wait for tables, sometimes we actually leave and drive to another branch as there are no tables, even in the bar.  Friday night was ridiculous, If you don't have children and want to go on a Friday night, go later to avoid the early evening family/school crowd. Twice I went to the bathroom to find a group of children hanging around gossiping and hogging the mirrors/sinks. No one ever seems to check the bath rooms as they are always out of paper and soap.  We found a free table (uncleared) and sat down, had to wait forever someone to notice us who then half cleared the table and disappeared. Had to signal someone to then clear the rest of the table. Then had to call someone else again for menus! I know it's busy, but keep an eye on your tables. Shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes for a drink!  Some of the servers are very good, very attentive etc but this guy was terrible. Bad attitude and kept disappearing!  The wings (which I normally enjoy) came with hardly any buffalo sauce and ranch thrown all over them, totally drowning them (I want the choice to add ranch to my wings OR not).  Decided to go for the 'wild' salmon which is $20 which isn't cheap for this kind of restaurant. It was so basic, the vegetables are like what you get on the side of an airplane meal- bland, no seasoning. The fish was over cooked and there was about ONE tablespoon of sauce. It was just so dry (took it home and gave it to the dog)  The other main, fish tacos had Too much sauce! Sort it out chef!  Nearly walked out at the end without paying after having to wait another 15 minutes for the bill (the place had emptied out by then). My advice is to go on a week night and sit at the bar where you can't be ignored!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2
Jess O.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,20,6,1.0,12/15/2017,"Never order delivery off their app or online & when manger says he will call you back they don't ever call back & no one seems to communicate with each other at all making things worse. Before I tell you about the delivery of only 3 items out of 12 then the disaster & complete disregard to me as customer that already paid I do have to say I never thought I would ever complain about BJ's. My kids love BJ's & we've normally go BJ's by Laguna Hills mall, which is amazing except for 1 time when they mixed up 1 kids w/fries instead of veggies. No big deal mistakes happen & we had a graduation dinner for my brother with most of family so for the sever to mess up 1 kids side with 27 people to get orders from & 5 being young kids was no big deal. We for the bill & realized they didn't  charge us for 1 kids meal because of that little mistake which no one even cared or complained about we just asked if they could bring out the veggies. So the 1 on El Toro is amazing unfortunately I won't be going to another BJ's after last night. I decided to order BJ's for delivery from this one in RSM on BJ's website. I've been to this one on a Thursday night with my kids & they weren't ever too busy. Plus I thought it's delivery how much can they really mess things up. Well I was wrong. They not only forgot to bring 9 of the 12 orders they also lied saying they would refund my card bring the missing food & have a manager call me back. I told guy I don't mind paying for I don't need anything back but I need the rest of my order so I can feed my kids. He said ok should be there in 45mins & manger would call me within an hour 1.5HRS at most. Not only did the not bring my entire food that was ordered at 4:45pm they also took almost 3HRS getting the rest of the order to me. No manger ever called. I've called at 8pm last night & told the forget it I went & got my kids food at the restaurant across from my house they were already done eating & about to go to bed. I said don't waist anyone's time but I would like to speak with a manger that was supposed to call me no later than. 7:30pm & I to be refunded for ONLY the items I didn't get since the delivery driver even said he only delivered 3 items. The 3 items he was given for my address. So I call & am understanding about them being busy& a manager not being able to speak to me but I was assured my $ would be refunded for the items I didn't receive. Well I was wrong not only was I not given a refund no one ever called me back like promised. I called today they said they would look into it & have the night manager call me today ASAP. No call ever came so I called again around 6:45pm. That manager said he had no clue what I was talking about & would look into it & me right back. Now that's it's almost an hour later I called back. They put Joy on the phone. The only manager that gave her name. She didn't have a clue either. They're blaming door dash but I know lots of people who order from door dash & have an issue. I've never had an issue with door dash. Door dash was more helpful than BJ's ever was because they kept calling trying to figure a way to fix the issue. The problem was I ordered from BJ's website so I had to deal with BJ's. After 2 days of a run around from BJ's employees & managers it made to where I'll never go to any BJ's again. FYI never order off the BJ's website or app it's a waist of time & $!! If I ever hear from a manager I'll update but I highly doubt I will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2

It's pretty decent price for dinner and beer selection is huge~ Definately a go to place for beer lovers! I was surprised to see it crowded for a Tuesday night, but my dad and I were seated pretty quickly. We started off with the BJ's porter, it was malty, chocolaty and full of body. My dad got the pork with pilaf and I got the Buffalo Chicken Pizza (mini size). Food came out pretty quickly despite the business. My pizza was warm and dough was super fluffy. I'm not a huge chicken breast fan, but the chicken was pretty juicy, not dry at all. Loved how the pizza wasn't drenched in sauce, the mini was the perfect amount for me. I tried a piece of my dad's pork and it was juicy and flavorful, the pork is pretty thicc, so it looked quite filling. We ordered the triple chocolate pizookie for dessert since it was $3 off pizookie (Tuesday special). The cookie was piping hot and super chocolaty, ice cream was super rich, definately a guilty sweet treat. The total was around $60, which is not bad at all for 3 beers, two entrees, an a dessert.

The service tonight was fast, friendly and efficient.  We noticed that they had some new menu items, and we were excited to try them.  The food was as good as we remembered, however the value (price of the food versus what you get), still needs improvement.   I still want to acknowledge and give kudos to the management for turning things around, and I hope to be able to give this a 4 or 5 star review in the near future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2

The Santa Fe salad with Shrimp is of good portion and tastes good. And of course the Pizza is what it is, Good! Oh and the Cucumber & Jalapeño Margarita is Bomb.

I thought a lot of the negative reviews were over exaggerated by people who don't really Yelp and just wanted to bitch. I had a good dine-in experience the first time and have gotten take out on quite a few occasions since. No major problems. Lately though... BJ's needs to get their act together.  On several occasions I've brought home food only to find that things aren't made properly or there are key components missing. I mean, who wants a Cobb salad that's missing the turkey, bacon and croutons? I think that's just called a garden salad, no? Another time, there was barely any salad in my tray. For $11. No joke. it was the size of a side salad with a few sparse ingredients sprinkled on.  Last week was the final straw. We ordered two salads to share for dinner and come home to find our Italian chop salad to be missing ALL of the meat and cheese and Cobb salad to be missing a couple of other things. Furious, but holding it together, I call and let them know. The MANAGER states that ""it's not even on the menu anymore"" and that the ingredients aren't all available. I told her she shouldn't have sold it then.  They refunded my money but the manager was not at all professional, made excuses and was condescending. Because I love the BJ's brand and wonder what the hell is going on with this location, I'm going to contact their head office and let them know that there are some major problems going on here.

Ginny T.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",10,10,,2.0,6/2/2016,"I love BJ'S food....Always consistently good, but the service here was awful. I came in for a late lunch/early dinner with my 2 sisters.  We were seated immediately, and offered a table, but asked for a booth.  The hostess sighed, but moved us to a booth (let me note it was a little after 4 so the restaurant had 2 other tabletops and that was it, except for 4-5 ppl at the bar.). So we waited for someone to greet us and take a drink/food order.  We waited over 10 minutes, while watching various employees wander back & forth with no apparent purpose.  My sister then had to ask the hostess to find a server for us.  Another sigh & no apology for the extended wait, no urgency on her part to fulfill our (routine) request.  After another 5 minutes, a male server, who obviously didn't want to be there,  took our drink order... 2 sodas & a pina colada.  The colada sat for so long before being delivered, it was watery.  We then ordered the food & it finally came, after about another 15 minutes (2 burgers & small pizza) by a different person.  Our original server came by to see if all was ""ok"" after another 15 minutes, and that was the last we saw of him.  I don't know if there was a shift change, but a different server took care if us, with no explanation.  It took forever for someone to stop by so we could order dessert and to finally get it.  We then had to ask for the bill. I know people don't always have their dream job, and that makes it hard to do a consistently good job,  but that many disengaged people on one shift made us feel unwelcome and that we were a nuisance!   All in all, I don't know if I would go back to this location...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=180

We had the best server, Brendan, super nice, quick, and not to mention funny. My friend already ordered a drink before I arrived so as I was looking what to order from the mojito selections, Brendan, recommended the watermelon mojito. GREAT choice! Not overly sweet, not too light or strong, and super refreshing with bits of watermelon meat in the drink! Then we decided to order a small pizza with pineapple, cheese, and tomatoes. Came out very quickly (wasn't too busy). Good pizza, not great. We then ordered a second round of drinks, she ordered a Stella and I asked Brendan about any fruity beers they had and he made another recommendation of a berry beer, and again...another great choice! I wish I could remember the name! We then checked out and were happy gals. He gave us an exceptional experience.

Erik F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",815,66,329,5.0,3/2/2014,"Came for lunch after first trying to have Thai, but finding the place closed. We often go to this BJ's and overall have great experiences - food, service, price. We use a rewards card, have a coupon and gift card so our back up choice wasn't too difficult. The kids got the kids pizza - one cheese and one pepperoni. Both are just like the adult version - fresh, hot and so tasty. I bribed my daughter into sharing some with me by offering to get a Pizookie for dessert.  Meal is $5.95 and includes drink. Good deal in my book.  My wife and I shared new Enlightened items - Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad. They both sounded great. The tacos did not disappoint, but the salad did somewhat. The tacos tasted good with the grilled chicken, cucumber, tomato, red onion, cilantro and a mild feta and Greek yoghurt sauce, not tzaziki, but more creamy and plain. The side was some type of grain salad, maybe tabouleh - very good and bit spicy. The salad was okay. It has romaine, blueberries, grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, pecans, pepitas, red onion and strawberry vinaigrette. The ingredient sound great, but didn't have as much wow factor as I was hoping for. Could use more of the non-salad ingrediants especially cheese and nuts. Also, I was disappointed that the brussel sprouts were not warm. I expected them warm since they are roasted. Besides that they were not cooked or seasoned enough. I know it's supposed to be light, but these should be sautéed in some OO which is a healthy fat. I really like the burnt Brussels at Cucina Enoteca. They would go great here. You can add chicken, shrimp or blackened salmon. Any of those probably would have brought the salad up a star. Emily was a great server and she was taking care of lots of tables. Then comes the pizookie - as always, super good and gone in 60 seconds. Regular chocolate chip soft, gooey and with vanilla ice cream.

In laguna hills, the bring out a bowl with avocado, tortilla strips and all the other goodies and pour your soup over it at the table in front of you.

I asked her if everything with the rest of the order is correct and she said yes. I drove home only to unpack our order and realize they gave me the wrong sandwich even though it had a computer generated sticker on the top with what the sandwich should be. So frustrating that they lack attention to detail to double check the things they are sending out to customers. I've had similar experiences with the dining in the restaurant as well.

Anthony A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",778,1013,99,2.0,12/6/2011,"I was ecstatic when I learned the decrepit, white trash haven known as T.G.I.Friday's was being razed to make room for a brand-spankin' new BJ's. Then I found out they're both owned by the same company. Meh, whatever. As long as they don't rehire the same barrel-scraped rejects from the old guard I'll be satisfied. So far, so good.  I avoided this spot for a few weeks until the locals could get the excitement of a new restaurant out of their system. One of my friends was in town, so we decided to hit up the bar for lunch. Seating was no problem in the bar area; there was a short wait for tables, though. This location is slightly smaller than the Lake Forest one, but they've somehow managed to squeeze in more TVs - perfect for a sports-hater like myself. We got a pitcher of Hefeweizen and annoyed our waiter by spending more time drinking/talking than looking at the menu. Once we finally did, I noticed it's essentially the same as most of their locations, so I got my usual favorite: balsamic glazed chicken.  In the interim, we sucked down the pitcher and I got a Bloody Mary. The waiter asked if I was sure, warning me it was spicy. It was not. When I told him that, he said ""some lady told him it was too hot"". Figures. Haha. It was pretty damn good, though. I thought the garnishment of a green bean, pepper and olive was a nice touch. I might have to make this my Sunday morning spot. Here's a big problem I've got with this location: the food sucks. I've eaten this dish a dozen times at other BJs and it was always delicious, but not this time. To quote the Simpsons, my chicken ""tasted like burning"", but not in a hot way; it was a ""we burned the shit out of this chicken and don't care"" way. The mashed potatoes were dry enough that I could've mistaken them for white sand. I didn't even bother with the onion rings, which looked limp and sad. I still ate it all because I was hungry, it was edible and I didn't feel like dicking around with the massive menu again. I'm more than likely going to be back here, so I'll be able to give something else a shot, but so far the only thing that did me right was the alcohol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=180

Rachel B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,14,1,5.0,1/3/2015,"We popped in to catch the second half of the Steelers-Ravens game at BJ's RSM and lucked out with a center table in the bar right in front of the big screen. The beer choices are the bomb at BJ's and we always seem to arrive before the Happy Hour is over so we go with the small plates. Tonight we ordered individual veggie pizzas and some avocado rolls. Both were very tasty and you can't beat the price. ($6.00 each) We also had a super fresh kale salad with lots of healthy add-ins like baby Brussels sprouts, fresh cranberries, a small amount of goat cheese, all tossed with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Ask for salt and fresh pepper grinder on the side. Salad is always a good way to damper any guilty feelings about devouring delicious appetizers.  We go to BJ's for relaxed fun, and to indulge in the kinds of foods we would not normally make at home.  Our server was on top of things although it was really busy in the bar. The manager Al came by our table to make sure everything was to our liking. He was very much a 'people person' who appears to enjoy his work and catering to the clientele. By the looks of some of the reviews on this page, perhaps some failed to voice their concerns about their food and were eager to get online and blog negative comments. I have never had a manager at any of the BJ's not listen to my comments. When there is a problem with the food, they have always been more than willing to make it right, or bring me something else. I have been eating at all the BJ's forever and would never walk out dissatisfied because their management would not have it. So, I suggest that the previous reviewers try it out again, talk to management if you have any concerns about the food or service. Be nice and they will be nice in return. This is a great neighborhood location that strives to serve their customers, and they work hard to create a local vibe and of friendliness.   We'll be back because we like the food, service, atmosphere, management, and proximity.  There is no better place to watch sports in all of RSM.

Extremely slow service for a Thursday night and it took forever to get drinks or drink refills. The food was the usual BJs faire and the pizookie is what increased the stars to 2. They really need to add more staff or revisit their business model. Our food runner was great, but the server was slow getting to us and following up. A simple refill for an iced tea took 15 minutes...I was curios so I did time it. Oh well, I got what I expected and also deserved for coming back.  Too bad, it is real convenient and the food is good... but went to this BJs for a school fundraiser for the local elementary.

Wedge salad had a huge core on the end of the lettuce that you couldn't even cut through or eat. Pepper shaker was sticky and so was the table. Asked for a pepper mill which of course they did not have.  Not much interaction with the server except he did ask if I would like to keep my fork and knife that was sitting in the dressing on my salad plate after I finished it. I asked for clean silverware. I got the silverware plopped in the middle of my entree when it arrived. They didn't even wipe the juice from the steak on the plate when it was served.

Vanessa C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",230,52,100,2.0,9/18/2013,"This review is mostly for the food. I went here with a group of friends on a weekday for dinner. Like other BJ's restaurants, the restaurant is casual and very loud. It seems like a lot of people come here after work for beer or happy hour.  The menu is huge. There are appetizers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, pastas, and entrees. Whenever I see this vast of selections on the menu, I get a little nervous. It seems like it would be harder for restaurants to perfect each dish if they offer so many choices. However, it is a chain, so I'm sure everything is shipped, frozen, and prepared according to the specifications set by the restaurant corporation Since it was a bit overwhelming to flip through the entire menu, I stuck to the Enlightened Entrees. Each dish in this section is under 575 calories. I chose the Moroccan Spiced Salmon. The menu described it as oven roasted salmon with served over roasted vegetable couscous and drizzled with roasted red pepper sauce. When I received my entree, I was surprised. I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary, but my dish didn't even look very appetizing.The plate was huge so everything looked tiny on the plate. (Refer to picture below-- look at all the white space on the plate!)  Also the roasted red pepper sauce should really be called ""thin, runny, watery mess."" My entire dish was drenched in this sauce and it made my cous cous and vegetables very, very sweet and soggy. I wish there were more of the almonds to provide a crunchy texture, but sadly I didn't taste it. The salmon was alright, nothing special. For $13, I'm not sure this dish was worth it.  We also shared the trio of Pizookies. Bj's is famous for their cookie and ice cream creation, and I remember really loving this dessert in the past. The pizookies we got were SO sweet. I am a crazy sweet tooth, but this was way too sugary even for me.  Service was pretty good. Our server was attentive, and she brought our food and drinks out quickly.  The sad part is that BJ's will continually receive a lot of customers in RSM because it's located in an area that lacks great casual restaurants--especially large, popular restaurants known for their lunch specials, happy hour and beer. It's in a convenient location, it's good for groups, and it's open late. A suburban winner right there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=200

Our server was Briesa, she was intelligent, flawless, very personable, just an all around a great server.  The food was also very good, tasty and arrived in a reasonable timeframe, and all at the same time. It seems there may have been a shake-up at this location. Anyway we were very happy and left quite satisfied.

Definitely try the deep fried artichoke hearts (these are regular menu) and the avocado egg rolls! We also got the pizza, spinach and artichoke dip and sliders, everything came out fast and you could say we cleared our plates ;). I loved the watermelon Mojito and my friend got the strawberry mojto, both super tasty!

I've tried a few regular menu items (some burger, some ribs), and both delivered exactly what one would expect in the $10-20 range. Not the best food ever, but still tasty.  Sure, an order may come out wrong or too slow every now and then. Then again, it is just a BJ's. The staff look like local highschool/college folk. If you absolutely demand some absurd level of service you should be willing and able to pay a couple hundred a plate. Anterooms with cigars and rad liquors served by dapper butler dudes whilst you wait for your table, check (no walk ins). Personal attendants for each party, you got it.

Craig P.,"Lake Forest, CA",12,10,,4.0,2/14/2014,"We frequent this BJ's a bit more than the Laguna Hills one (which is a bit closer) for a couple of reasons: 1. It is actually faster to get to, and in and out, and home than the LH restaurant. They do pretty good at getting the orders correct (we use 99% take out), only once having them really back up and keep take out people waiting (which, at 30 minutes late was worth noting, but once out of 20+ times ordering isn't a trend) 2. We just have received better food there. I don't order pizza there any longer (coming from Chicago, there are much better ""Chicago style"" places in Orange County), so we usually have pasta, salads, and appetizers. Generally speaking, the food is usually cooked well. I do agree with others that it can get really crowded, and can be a bit expensive, but overall I would give them a higher than average rating, but not an exceptional one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=220

Jayson O.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",148,178,157,3.0,7/9/2013,"I've been here a few times now since it's initial opening and can say it's been a slow, but at least persistent in terms of improving but still has a way to go. It's hard to put a finger on exactly what the issue is, but if I had to garner a wager, it would be my belief that this locations mentality is ""turnkey, turnkey, turnkey"", because this place is pretty darn busy most of the time (probably because one thing RSM lacks in is quality, family restaurants).  However, this translates into a rushed kitchen, and a rushed kitchen tends crank out food, assembly line style, and thus quality control suffers. This was evident the other evening when our large pizza came out to our table, luke warm, and not cooked in the middle (i.e. raw dough).  Easy fix,...waiter was very friendly and apologetic, no questions asked to get us another one...but it even took longer to get than the first one.  On the plus side, this one was done and tasted great, but the re-fire of 30 minutes made for an uneven experience as the other guests at our table had finished their meal by the time the second pizza came out. For once, I tried something off the 'light-menu'.  I had the BBQ Bison Burger (550 cal, $9.95) and was very pleased.  It was actually very tasty, and I give a thumbs up to the calorie conscience slaw. Appetizers to our table included the potato skins, which were in fact both crispy and not very greasy (something you normally don't expect with this dish), so thumbs up here as well. Service was above average.  We scored a fine young man who checked on us constantly. So the drawbacks?  Feels somewhat chaotic and loud in there at times, and you can't help but feel like they are in-fact rushing you at times to get you back out the door.  Over the course of the handful of times I've been there, there has also been at least something wrong with one or more dishes....either cold, sometimes missing items, substitution requests ignored, etc...Like I said, the kitchen expediter isn't paying attention and just pushing stuff out.  Slow down, read the tickets, double check, and things should improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=220

The bar is serviced well and they take care of their customers promptly. The meu is ok, not perfect by any means, but I am satisfied with it. As a single person, I am less picky by myself when not entertaning guests. Their best item on the menu in my opinion, Parmesean Crusted Chicken is great. The burgers are very good, but the Bison burger is best and you can order just like the other burgers. Like I said, not a great menu for a serious night out, but good enough for me. Now for the best part, the beer. They have a great selection and as a beer lover, I am always in a good mood here. You should be able to find what you want here or very close to it. The atmosphere here is very good, I enjoy Friday/saturday evening here at the bar for a couple beers and maybe dinner or an apetizer. I see a lot of critical reviews on this place, not sure what the issue is.

Z W.,"San Marcos, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/6/2015,"Well I should have checked yelp first and saved myself a horrible experience. As others have stated the service and management are really a joke. We came for the ribs and of course they where out!!!! We should have left but ordered something else. We waited 30 minutes for our food to come out. Then when it did come out my husbands steak was burnt and he asked for it medium. So back it went and another 25 minutes went by. No apologies, no manager stopping by, nothing.  So my son and I had completely finished our food before my husbands even hit the table!!!!! I'm sorry but the turn over of tables is relatively fast at a restaurant like this. If I a saw a couple with a 1 yr old at a table for over an hour and one person had no food while the others had eaten and they r trying to keep there child entertained as a manager I might check that everything is ok.  Nope!!! Nada!!!! That is too much to ask for. I can forgive sub par food but I honestly cannot handle terrible management.

Heather C.,"Orange County, CA",0,22,2,1.0,4/21/2013,"HORRIBLE CURBSIDE SERVICE EXPERIENCE. I usually have a good experience with BJ's in Orange County but the location in RSM was very disappointing to say the least. I placed a curbside order on 4/21/13. The young ladies that helped me were nice but just before leaving I noticed that my order was not correct. I had to call them back on the curbside number and point out that  that the baked potato I had order wasn't in the bag. I was then told that someone forgot to put the order in for the baked potato and that they were sorry about the error and they would fix it right away. So I decided to eat the sandwich I ordered while I was waiting and then noticed that it was missing the avocado and bacon. So this time I went into to tell them about the additional error. The young lady was sorry and said she would bring me the missing sandwich items right away. So I went back out to my vehicle to wait for the missing items.  After about 25mins of no signs of the missing baked potato or sandwich items I went inside again. The young lady apologized and went into the kitchen to check on the potato and get me the avocado. She returned after a few minutes with the most pitiful presentation of avocado I have ever seen. The last thing you want to see as a customer that has just spent an extra 30mins waiting for food that isn't correct on a supposed fast curbside pickup. Another worker walked the avocado into the back to ask for it be fixed and check on the hold up on the potato. After about 3 minutes she returned to tell me that a manager was coming to talk to me.  The manager finally arrived to inform me that they were now out of baked potatoes and that he was sorry. He offered to sub the potato for something else. At this point I was pretty much over the possibility of waiting for them to get me something else, especially with it taking over 15mins just to get a decent side of avocado. Which when was brought again was still lame but I was over the whole incident at this point. The manager ended up removing all my charges for the potato I never got and the sandwich, but honestly he should have offered something additional for the 40min wait time after I arrived at the curbside deliver area. BJ's you need to step up the level of customer service. Make sure your chefs are making an awesome presentation on everything especially for the orders that got botched by the staff. There are a ton of other restaurant choices in RSM and going forward this BJ's location probably won't even be a consideration of a place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=240

Melissa S.,"San Clemente, CA",44,105,20,2.0,9/14/2012,"Before there was BJ's, there was a failed!TGIF in this same location. While I wouldn't call myself superstitious, I do think that they should maybe burn some sage or something...perhaps there's some lingering negative energy in here.  Or, perhaps this BJ just sucks. Last Friday myself and three friends popped into the bar for a quick drink. I ordered a Meyer's rum with cherry cola, which was served to me in a small glass filled nigh to the brim with ice. Sadly, my drink was also lacking the cherry grenadine that would have helped mask the rum's strong flavor. I was a little surprised that the bartender got it wrong, as he made a bit of a show of pouring the rum into the (did I mention it was tiny?) glass. Also, we were the only ones seated at the bar. So, I asked him if he had any cherries, hoping he might remember what I actually ordered. He replied that yes, they had them, and stared at me like a deer in headlights. I then had to ask if I could get some, and he brought them back. No offer to add grenadine, but left too fast for me to ask. A young lady who was also bartending saw me trying to squeeze the juice out of my cherries into my glass, and she kindly asked if I might like some grenadine! That girl was a gem and the only good thing about the experience. Without asking if we wanted anything else (and all four of us were almost finished with our drinks) he brought us our checks and shortly thereafter, was relieved by another bartender...I know he wanted a tip for his ""services"", but I felt that it was very rude to try to force us to pay when we weren't finished, especially without asking if there was anything else he could get us since it was still a good couple of minutes before he left. I work in a restaurant and bartend some nights; I'm not asking for anything that I wouldn't ordinarily do myself in their shoes. In a way, it was probably for the best that I didn't get a second beverage -- the new bartender was obnoxious, loudly talking over the patrons in the bar-area so he could shout at his work-friends. My group was annoyed by him so we left.  I really wish I had gotten a beer instead of an awful mixed drink that I payed about $8 bucks for and didn't even get me buzzed.

The kids had soccer games and we didnt feel like cooking. My Daughter, who is 10 years old, decided to go with the Fried Chicken Tenders. After waiting about 30 minutes to get the food, she decided to tear into her chicken. What we found was uncooked chicken. Now, Im not talking about undercooked, slightly pink, or the juices were slightly pink. I am talking about RAW chicken. The type of chicken you would see at your local supermarkets chicken aisle.  After bringing this up to the manager, he said that he would take it back and cook it some more. REALLY?!?!? At least offer to replace it with a new one. Nope, he would just cook that one through. We told him not to bother. He brought out a new one anyways. After explaining to him that her appetite for their chicken had gone, she stuck to french fries, as you couldnt really screw it up.  The only benefit to the meal was that (after my wife lost her cool), they did comp the meal and they did bring her a pazookie. My wife ordered the salad, she said it was pretty good. My son ordered a burger, it had no flavor at all. Not bad, but not good. I had the pork chops. They screwed up my order and the chops were tiny. Not bad, but not something to get if you are hungry.  If you are in the area, and you are just going for the food, save yourself the time and headache and go to mcdonalds across the parking lot. At least you know what you are getting there.

For some reason, the food just does not come out hot or well prepared here. Pizza comes out with minimal cheese and the toppings are concentrated on the very center of the pizza whereas the 90% of the rest of the pizza has nothing on it. The soup is cold and oftentimes the silverware you get is dirty with all sorts of extra ""protein"" left on them.  Most of the servers here aren't very good either. On at least two of the occasions, our food came out incorrect. While our servers were contrite most of the time, how hard is it to not put onions on something?

David L.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",29,4,,1.0,8/30/2014,"The service here is hit or miss. The hostess or hostesses that greet you at the door are dismissive and of no use when it comes to tabling. Getting the food you want depends on what you order. If you haven't been to BJ's the pizzas and pastas are usually what people order the most of. Other popular items that are readily available are the appetizers and pizookies. I ordered the Ribeye steak with seasonal vegetables and tomato bisque soup. The rib eye steak was cooked the way I liked it - medium rare - but I doubt anyone orders the steak when they go to BJ's which is why it led me to believe that the lack of flavor coming from the steak was because it sat in the refrigerator too long and the cut was poorly selected. I never got my tomato bisque soup, probably because no one orders tomato bisque soup at BJ's. The service is okay. Again the hostess/hostesses at the front are useless (this is what happens when you hire teenagers to do a job that requires quality customer service).  Our waitress did an excellent job taking our order, she couldn't pour the beer I had ordered, and when she notified me that my soup isn't coming out, she did her best to accommodate me. Even when they brought out our food, my sister had asked for red pepper flakes. They never brought it to her. Because of my tomato soup fiasco, the manager even came out to assist in making my experience better: offering to change the channels on the TV, offering a different side in exchange for the soup, etc. He seemed to be very engaged in satisfying his patrons. All in all, the execution from this BJ's is poor. You need to constantly asked to be helped and even if it's a result of being understaffed, the staff there still can't do their job. The lack of service and quality of food is what earns this BJ's one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=280

Marcel C.,"San Clemente, CA",100,19,7,1.0,9/28/2015,"Last night I took my girlfriend here, we ordered a couple drinks and I'm a bartender myself so I know what they should taste like and how they should be made. She got a lemon drop which was made wrong, there was no sugar rim and it tasted like lemonade, there was no alcohol taste at all and only half the glass was poured so I literally think she only added tripplesec and forgot the standard 1.5 vodka pour. My beer was two inches of head so immediately we started the night trying to fix the bartenders errors. My girlfriend politely walked up to the bar and asked if there was something the bar tender could do to make her drink right because she and I tasted no alcohol and there was no sugar rim and it was half full. The bar tender, Alexis just said ok what do you want me to do about it and looked at my gf with a blank resting bitchface. My gf then asked her if she could just try making it the right way and then Alexis rudely walked away and made another, with no sugar rim but at least I could tell there was probably 1.5 ounces of vodka.. the rest of the experience was awkward with the bartender staring at us and talking to her coworkers, if we're going out and paying for drinks and service, coming from the service industry ourselves we just expect things to be made right, we were polite and tipped well still but the experience was ruined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=280

After about 40 minutes of waiting only one plate came first and when the second plate arrived 10 minutes later it was incorrect. I have manners and would never eat before the other persons food was ready. So we told them they got the order wrong and if we could change it for the right item. Well, by the time they got it right my food was not very hot anymore and I was ready to take it to go. Overall the host was alright with his service, not very welcoming.

My bf didn't like peanut butter which is why he didn't want mine.. To top it off I found 2 hairs in my pizookie. No big deal because everything was free. We gave the server a $20 tip just cuz everything was free, also cuz she was new and sweet. I went here again today and our side of fries took forever that they gave it to us for no charge.

It is the closest location to my house and we have ordered here 3 times to go and I have been there once for lunch. We ordered the fish and chips which tasted okay but was really dark and too close to being burnt. They forgot the tartar sauce and vinegar... which is just not cool. My dad had to drive back and get those and they just apologized, that is it! We also ordered the tomato soup which my mother said was really good but really how can you mess that up. I have had the avocado spring rolls which taste great but were packaged poorly and the lid to the sauce was left open and splashed everywhere. The avocado was all brown which does not affect the taste but is very unpleasant to look at. The onion strings were 3.49 and you could see the bottom of the container they were in. Maybe 1 1/2 handfuls at best...ridiculous. The pizza looks okay and tastes good but is cold. When we actually went in about 2 weeks ago it was about 2:00pm and the bar had about 5 people and the tables were empty. Nobody came to seat us and I actually had to shout out after 10 minutes of us standing there feeling very awkward. A server looked at me and just ignored, then a second later a gal came over and seated us. The waitress was grody and kind of trashy looking. She did not care at all and was just very basic.

Perfect place to sit back and watch any sports games. Onto the service, our server was attentive and got all of our orders and drinks.  The only problem was since we had a large party, they messed up on some of the orders of my friends.  Like no sauce on one mini pizza and accidentally adding an ingredient that was requested to be taken off of another mini pizza. Also, one of the servers, when our food came out, said one of the entree names and it took a bit because the person who ordered it was mid conversation, but we showed him where to put it, and he slammed the order down... (that's kinda rude) As usual, everyone ordered the pizookies, my bf and I shared the trio, we picked two of them to be chocolate chunk chip and the third to be white chocolate macadamia nut. It's always a hit. The only problem again was my friend found a piece of hair in her ice cream and another friend asked for the ice cream on the side and it wasn't.

There were a ton of wait staff milling around the place and we had not just one servers coming to our table, but two. Not sure which one was the actual server, but most likely the one that brought us the check...finally.  We initially ordered something to drink and finally some food which included an appetizer and a meal after the server decided to return after an extended absence. Then during the long wait for the food, I asked from some bread in the meantime. The bread was brought out and I had to ask for silverware since none was present at our table. Our food then arrived which we enjoyed, but they never came to refill our drinks our even ask if I wanted another beer. After eating one of the servers came over to tell us all about the desert, but we mentioned we only wanted the check because we had to leave. She had to track down the server to get him to give us the check. When he came back, he looked through his checks for various tables, but didn't have ours and had to leave again. He finally came back and we promptly paid and left.  It's a new place and the staff is new so I give them the benefit of the doubt. Plus the food was good so I'm excited to try it again.

Kevin I.,"Salt Lake City, UT",125,76,29,5.0,4/7/2013,"Not sure what is going on with all these bad reviews.  We discovered this BJs last January and have been back several times at different times of the day and night since then.  How can you go wrong with a place that serves COLD craft beers and Americas favorite, PIZZA?  Not to mention their pizookies.  I give this place 5 stars because our service has been nothing less than gracious and the servers really work hard to please everyone. Not to mention the food is consistently delicious.  Our last server, Katrina, was so caring.  She made certain we had everything we needed and with a three year old, that is some times difficult.  The atmosphere is perfect for me and my family.  My daughter loves the pizookies and I get to enjoy a cold one while watching most any sport. In a family atmosphere. Our last visit was on a Sunday brunch, while there are not a lot of choices on the brunch menu, the one item i honed in on is French Toast.  It was well prepared, hot and the syrup came hot as well.  Yummy.   RSM is short on good restaurants.  I have seen other restaurants get raving reviews on here that I thought were just average.  So, perhaps it is just preference.  Either way, give this place a try and let me know if you liked it or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=320

Fifty percent of the time everything was fine, the other two times it was COMPLETELY crazy how many things went wrong. Somehow the kitchen timing is off.  The food arrives at all different times. I think the real problem is the manager is never in view. All other places the manager is checking the floor to make the customers are happy. This doesn't happen here.  We left last night very disappointed and had dessert at another local establishment.  (We were afraid that they would mess up our dessert order, too.)

When she finally got through to the manager and explained the situation, he said they had ""changed their menu"" to make it less spicy for people, and that is why there was barbeque sauce on the buffalo pizza.  My grandma told him no where on the menu does it say it has bbq sauce on it, and he played dumb. It was obviously a bullshit lie to try and cover their asses, but the pizza I got had none of the proper ingredients on it. It was a fricken bbq pizza.

Yes,  I understand this particular location is new and as a result is pretty busy.  I went here with my girlfriend and her family on a Wednesday night to celebrate her birthday.  It was packed.  We were a party of 8 and got a 20 minute wait estimate so we thought no problem right?  Well we were stuck waiting outside for close to an hour and 15 minutes.  They finally had a table ready for us.  While we were walking to it, I couldn't help but notice multiple booths that could seat 5+ that were given to parties of 2 while tables that could seat 2 were left empty.  What gives?   The service just wasn't what I would expect and was sub-par at best.  The food didn't really taste as good as I've had at other BJs restaurants.  On top of it,  I've never seen so many 65+ year olds in a restaurant or bar ever.  Was it bingo night down the street or what?  Maybe there is an RSM Leisure World I don't know about?

L L.,"Secaucus, NJ",2,36,6,1.0,11/15/2013,"My boyfriend and I have been here maybe four times since we moved to RSM. Our last two visits were in the last month. We used to go to BJ's often before we moved, but every time we've come to this location, we've had a bad experience -- a couple of the more common issues are service is slow and we always had to ask for eating utensils because some tables had them and some didn't (they'd even serve the appetizers without realizing we didn't have utensils). Even when it was relatively dead, our servers were nowhere to be seen. It'd make sense if they were really busy and hadn't come by yet, but when it's not busy, it just seems like they're really inattentive or messing around out of sight or something. Oh, we've gotten their mushrooms appetizer a couple times and it seems like they're using button mushrooms or something. They're always so tiny and the fact that they use a huge plate for it only emphasizes how small they are and how few you get. Not worth the cost, in my opinion. I finally decided to say something to the manager on our previous visit (we went once more last night, but I'll get to that shortly). We went on a Friday night and they were really busy, as expected. I ordered a ribeye and BF got the chicken fried steak. His steak was really dry and mine was way undercooked (I got it medium rare and this was nearly raw), which was a big portion of it considering about half of it was fat. I don't mind eating a little fat with my steak, but I wasn't going to eat pure fat. I cut most of it away and also the raw part and ended up with a piece that was half the size of my palm, only a quarter of the steak's original size. I don't know how the cook could've picked that up raw and thought it was a good piece to cook and serve. We barely saw our server because it was so busy and when he showed up, he took my plate away. Not having much to eat, I spent my meal talking to BF while waiting to spot our server and I didn't notice when he was clearing the table. There goes all the evidence of my ""steak."" I asked to speak to a manager and he tried to tell me that ribeye was a fatty cut and I said it wasn't like I was expecting NO fat, but most of it was fat and inedible (at least for me; I don't mind a bit of fat in a bite, but like I said, I won't eat just fat. That's kinda gross). I also mentioned that BF's steak was super dry. He offered to take off half the cost of the meal, but much to my dismay, BF interjected and said it wasn't necessary. I think my steak was like $20 and I was really peeved that we paid that much for a steak that was mostly thrown away and uncooked. The manager stopped us on our way out and handed me a $15 gift card, which was nice of him, but we weren't sure if we were going to come back. Yesterday, we stopped by again to use the gift card. Originally, I said we could use it for beer because my boyfriend enjoys BJ's beers, but we decided to give their food another shot. It was far less busy than our previous visit, though it felt like whoever showed up thought it was kids' night; there was no shortage of children running around, crying, and playing in the revolving doors (the hostesses just looked on and busied themselves with something at their station). I don't mind kids, but I do mind parents who let their kids run rampant.  My boyfriend ordered the ribeye and I thought I'd stick with something ""safe"" so I ordered the BJ's bacon burger with a lettuce wrap (avoiding bread right now). His ribeye came out with the amount of fat I'd expect and was cooked perfectly (he likes his rare. but he wouldn't even touch my steak last time). My burger was a really thin patty, something like a White Castle burger. BF took a look at it and said we could've gotten something better at Carl's Jr. and for cheaper. The round, puffy shape of the lettuce wrap really hid how small the patty was. Knowing I was disappointed (again) and that I was envying his perfect ribeye, he gave me a few pieces of it (he's so sweet). We've sworn off BJ's for now. Every time we've gone, it seemed like they were understaffed (and we've been going over a span of months, so I'm surprised they still haven't figured out how many people they need for a particular night...and are they seriously not reading these reviews?). We might visit the bar, but I don't want to waste any more money on their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=300

The waiter was totally confused and had to recheck our order twice.  The food for the four of us came out at four different times, but the worst part was the chicken was RAW.  My friend ordered half a chicken sandwich and soup, thank God it was half a sandwich or he would not have seen it until he had taken a bite.  The manager came out and apologized, yet it still took another 20 minutes for them to bring a new sandwich, at which time everyone else at the table had already finished their meals. I ordered a turkey burger with a cup of soup to start.  The soup arrived after the turkey burger, and the burger was dry as a desert.  The manager did comp the raw chicken sandwich, but it was to little to late.

It probably took about 20-30 minutes to get the food which seemed a little bit longer than I would've normally thought given that the restaurant was maybe 1/4 full. The pizza itself had good flavor but it wasn't what I would call hot and the texture just seemed off for some reason. We also ordered another appetizer which came out quickly and tasted excellent. The service was decent; our waitress made sure she frequently checked on us throughout the night and kept our drinks full.

Ryan M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",49,11,,1.0,4/19/2012,"Well, if you want a great restaurant with fast hot food, I suggest walking across the street to McDonald's, cause you sure as hell won't get any of that at the B.J.s in RSM. I've been there twice now... Both times I've had the same experience.. Hostess are extremely friendl however servers take a few minutes to take our drink order, and another few minutes to bring it, another 5-10minutes to ask if we are ready to order and if you are and do order takes easily 30minutes to receive it. First experience: M girlfriend and I order 1(one) diet coke 1(one) water and 1(one small pizza) around 12:30pm( my girlfriend was on a lunch break and she gets an hour) At 12:45 my girlfriend gets her diet coke and before I can ask for my water the waitress turns around and walks away. Around 13:00(1pm) no water no pizza no server to be found. I got up and found a hostess and asked were my server was and the hostess said and I shit you not "" I don't know I'm not a server."" Around 13:15(1:15pm) I got up and found a manager and said ""we needed to go and I left $3 dollars on the table for our server if you can find her"" His responses "" What about the Pizza?"" My response"" what pizza?"" He goes"" I saw you eat a pizza"" Now, if I did, I wouldn't have a problem paying for it, but since I never got it I shouldn't have to wait 45minutes to NOT get it than pay for it. I laughed at his comment and tried to leave with my girlfriend, and which point the manager said "" if I leave without paying he will call the cops"" I looked and him and said"" go for it"" Needless to say he does call the cops and I get pulled over on my way to drop my girlfriend off at work. I explain to the police officer that we never received our pizza and we had to go.  Long story short, after reviewing the videos the cops determined that the server took the pizza to the wrong table and that the manager thought I was that table( I have a Mohawk with full sleeves of tattoos, pretty sure I'm noticeable) After that experience, my girlfriend convinced me to try it again so I do with similar problems. Slow to take our order, slow to bring it out. Wrong bill total. Double charged for beer, again server claiming I consumed it. Than pizza was colder than my beer. Order wings and pizza and got the pizza first and Wings at the same time the waitress took out empty pizza bin. Seriously after reading the reviews on yelp, I'm amazed that they are still open.  If only had one restaurant server worst than this, and that was at DICKs last resort, And even than dicks gets my order correct.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=360
Summer Y.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,2,,1.0,1/18/2014,"So many times I have wanted to leave some negative reviews for places that really got under my skin. But I didn't want to waste my time bi***ing about an irrelevant place.  Disclaimer: I love BJs. A lot. My boyfriend and I go here at least 2-3 times a week.  Now on to the bad~ This location is absolutely horrendous. I dread going here but sometimes we don't always feel like going to the Laguna hills location but we go to get the beer and yummy food although service is horrible. Each and every time the host/hostesses fall short of their small duties; No greeting when you walk in ""hi welcome to bjs"" nothing but a blank stare ""how many, okay 2, step to the side"" literally. Also walk past them texting in there little booth as you walk out and nothing! Thanks for coming! Have a good day. Nope. Besides all this service is beyond slow even when not even half way full! But really is this location ever full? There's always a front parking spot and never a wait time, that says something. Also don't expect utensils, refills or friendly fast service.  MOST IMPORTANT REASON IM WRITING THIS REVIEW: my bf and I ate here Thursday night around 8pm and then at 4am Friday I woke up to violent food poisoning! Threw up at least 5-6times every hour from 4am-1pm let me not forget to mention things coming out both ends! Until around 1pm my boyfriend decided I needed to go to the hospital where I laid in a hospital bed for 7hrs hooked up to an iv! That was seriously probably the most sick I'd ever been in my life. Now Saturday night after being in bed all day and eating nothing but 3 jello cups and like 4 crackers. My boyfriend has now come down with it as well. I hoped it was just my entree that made me sick so that it wouldn't be the appetizer and make him sick as well but we both see how that went. HILIGHT: Pros!

Holly L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",76,49,12,1.0,7/30/2014,I have tried this place many many times in the hopes they could get it together. For a chain restaurant they should know how to run food.  The servers at this location are terrible.  I pushed to keep going here but every time I am so upset when I leave I just can't do it.   No matter how you order your food will overlap.  They do not know how to space out the tickets. If I order an app and it takes 15-20 maybe you shouldn't let the salads come out first especially if they were ordered 10 minutes later!!!! Keep the drinks full.  If you want me to think you are busy don't stand and talk to coworkers right in front if me.  Just know that the further you are from the kitchen the longer and more messed up your food delivery time will be. No one wants to run food that far and it is obvious.  I can't even blame one person because the last 5 were terrible in their own way.   One girl told me my salad was wrong because the salad cook was mad at her.  Gee I really want to eat this food now!  I will not be coming back.  Better off at Selma's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=360

M W.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",0,12,,2.0,11/14/2013,"Normally, I would send this kind of response to corporate. From reading the reviews, it seems that their corporate office doesn't respond to emails. I only wished I'd read these reviews before adventuring here again and not while I was sitting in the restaurant wondering if it was only me that thought this place provide horrible service. Tonight was the first time I had been to this restaurant in 7 or 8mos. I just left what will be my very last visit to this establishment. What make me rate this place low is the service. We use to come to this restaurant frequently but after a while we went to this place less and less. The reason is simply that it takes an awful long time to have food brought to the table. This place has been opened for around 2yrs at least. This has been plenty of time to figure out how to bring customer orders faster. It comes off as if it's a constant  issue regarding employee scheduling. It should be easily known the busiest hours and there should be enough staff. Otherwise, the managers on duty need to be in the kitchen running orders or cooking. I arrived this evening, placed an appetizer order, and food order. The server asked to start with drinks but fearing we wouldn't see her for another extended amount of time, I ordered everything and clearly stated our mozarella sticks would be an appetizer. After waiting well beyond the time for mozarella sticks, I told the nearest person who came our way, busboy, to cancel our appetizer since the food should be coming out soon. Or so I thought! Shortly after, a staff member came over with a salad that was apart of my child's meal. I told her that I wanted our appetizer cancelled since we are now receiving part of a meal that was intended not to be an appetizer. The server comes over and attempt to state that the kitchen is backed up and it's within the amount of time since our meals were not on the table. Seriously!?! One adult and one child, an appetizer, and two meals! The child's salad had come out. What are the odds the kid will eat cheese sticks and the rest of the meal at this point!?! What do we still need an appetizer for when the food is starting to come out, and it's only two people eating tonight. After I refused the appetizer, our server did not return to our table until after we were done eating our meal. sThere was no return visit ater the food had been brought to the table to see if we needed anything or to inquire about the food's taste. When the plates are practically emptied is not a time to ask is everything alright.  I would just like the restauarant and server to know, your service is crappy. I normally leave a 20-25% tip, because years ago I worked as a server part-time. I couldn't bring myself to do it after our server never came to check on us after the meal arrived to the table. I left the crappy 15% tip which was only $2.25 to reflect the crappy service received and due to the restaurant constantly being slow and seeming to have a ""it's alright to not provide service"" attitude. You will not have to worry about me refusing another appetizer, because we will not be back. I know I used a kid's free meal coupon, but I was prepared to leave a tip on the amount before the coupon which would had been $4 or $5 on our $20 meal prior to the coupon difference. Had we received our appetizer before the meal started to arrive, I would had probably left a $5 or $6 tip.  Even after I asked for the general manager's card from the hostess as we were leaving, there was no acknowledgement from the hostess booth about a manager-on-duty being available to respond to my concerns. The food taste was fine, but there is no way I will be at this place again.  It's almost as if they hired the people who use to work at the El Torito's, and thank goodness that place closed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=380

They seemed very befuddled that the oven overcooked the food but they more than made up for it in service apologizing profusely and giving him a free pizza to go.

I give everyone the benefit of the doubt before I do this.  I love BJ's. The food is always great, so I was naturally really happy when the new arrival came to RSM. Problem is, The food is always yummy, but every time I go there is ALWAYS a problem with the staff and service. Whether it is that the food comes out wrong, or the service is really really slow, or the server is not very helpful or nice.  I just went there for lunch today and we had to wait 30 min just to order food, our server was given way Way too many tables so she didn't come to check on us and once we put our food in it took 50 min just to get to the table.  If this kind of thing happened only once in a while I don't really mind. Everyone makes mistakes or gets really busy and we all know that stuff happens. However when it happens 75% of the time, I feel like someone needs to say something so it doesn't keep happening.

Last time we were there, I ordered a pizza, thinking they couldn't go too wrong with their signature dish, but it was disgusting -- I couldn't eat more than a few bites, and went home still hungry. It was soggy, bland, and just a mess. For a while, we thought we might at least still go there occasionally just for a pizookie, but then we noticed that Selma's has a pizookie-type dessert on their menu (called the mothership). So nope, we're done with BJ's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=400

Shanel D.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/31/2015,"Went to this location this afternoon (a Saturday) with my 2 children, and the place was pretty empty. Yet, when we walked in, 2 other groups were waiting to be seated and the hostess was nowhere to be found. I saw several servers walk by, but no one offered us so much as a ""someone will be with you shortly."" When she finally did arrive, she seemed flustered. We waited to be seated (in an empty restaurant), but my son had chosen to go there so I tried to make the best of it. When we were taken to our seat they tried giving us a small table in the middle, but when dining alone with my kids, I find booths to be easier & more comfortable so I asked for one. She let me take one (they were all empty in that section), but seemed reluctant to do it. Took about 10 min to get a drink order in (2 kid milks & I water). Food order was taken in a timely manner, and the server was friendly enough. However, the food took FOREVER to arrive (1 med pizza with just pepperoni and one kid's corndog meal). There was only one other group seated in my section so I have no idea what on earth took so long! The servers changed shifts during our meal & once again our replacement was friendly enough. But when it was time to pay the bill, my card and the bill folder sat at the end of our table for way too long before she took it to ring it up. She also didn't offer us a bag for our leftovers, even though we had two bulky styrofoam boxes and she saw I was alone with 2 kids in tow, (my daughter is 3, so she def takes up one hand because she holds it when we're walking in the parking lot), and it's kind of difficult balancing two styrofoam boxes in one hand. Thankfully a lovely lady at the curbside pick up station offered me a bag, unprompted, when I asked if I could leave my boxes on her counter while I took my kiddos to the restroom on the way out. She earned an extra star. I wish I would've read these reviews prior to coming here. When it first opened, it was much better, but the service has gone down tremendously. It's a real shame, too, because my son likes BJ's & we live super close by. However, I can't see us returning here again.

Quality of food (seared ahi salad, clam chowder in a bread bowl) + Italian wine were great. Plus, I think they have the longest menu I've seen so far and that might be the reason why it takes a while to get your food. The first rule of a good restaurant is a short menu. I did not have any issue with the timing though and the place was packed. Try having fun instead of counting the minutes. Try their beer , order some munchies while you wait and just chat to your companion. That's a good recipe for a good time. Being obsessed with time keeping never works.

I had a caesar and he had a broccoli cheddar soup.  When they picked up our appetizer plates we asked again for drinks, and they forgot again.  But they brought us our food and while my boyfriend wasn't too keen on his jalapeno burger (he just wanted more jalapenos), I LOVED my NY steak.  Honestly, one of the best steaks I've had in a while, good quality meat, perfectly seasoned, better than most steak houses.  The green beans were really bland, they didn't have butter or salt and pepper or anything- they were literally just steamed green beans- but that's fine with me.  I squeezed some lemon on them and was happy as a clam.  However, our server didn't return for about a half an hour, and when she did we asked again for some water and a coffee.  Twenty more minutes went by and she didn't return.  We had to leave so I went and grabbed a manager.  He apologized all over himself, got us a few waters to drink and took care of our meal.  Aside from the waitstaff being too busy and inattentive, I have to give my props to this restaurant.  They're trying, and their food is good.

All you do is get a glass n go to the tap. After about 15 mins my beer came out and we were told our pizookies will come out shortly. After about 10 more minutes I went to ask for the manager however the hostess said she would take care of it. Fine, just get my pizookies out. The waitress then asked me 'what's the problem?' Keep in mind this is the first time she has checked up on us. I told her and her reasoning was 'well other tables have waited over 20 minutes as well'. Don't see how that's helping the cause because now I know I'm probably not the only one upset with the service here. Finally they came out and we asked for the check in anticipation of it taking a long time. Ends up the manager comp'd our pizookies because it took over 30 minutes for them to come out. I would assume the manager would at least stop by to explain/apologize for what happened, especially considering I asked for him/her earlier.

FIRST TIME Waiter wasn't sure of the menu, pizza and food was delivered fine, although it took a long time. SECOND TIME Waiter seemed new.  Appetizer was brought out about 5 minutes after the pizza, with no apology, no explanation, just ""oh, they get busy and get confused"".  This was a Friday night and I know they are new, but they need to get their act together. THIRD TIME This was the worst.  I asked what kind of non BJs beers they had, the waitress had no idea.  When she returned, she said the bartender was busy so couldn't tell her right now.  Finally I went to the bar and asked myself (I wanted to see what the Lost Abbey beer was, which the bartended said was an IPA, but Lost Abbey doesn't even make IPAs).  I ordered a BJs beer instead (Grand Cru, which BTW, is very good).  It took over a half hour to get my beer.  We ordered pizza (medium BJs fave, mini cheeseburger pizza and a kids cheese only) and two salads (side salad w/dressing on the side and a dinner salad with chicken).  It took almost an hour and a half to get our food.  The two salads came out (the one that was supposed to have the dressing on the side was smothered with it, the chicken one had no dressing at all).  We told the waitress but she made no attempt to fix the problem.  Finally the medium pizza came out (seriously, after an hour and a half) room temperature.  The waitress said the other two pizzas had been under the warmer and needed reamade (at least another 30 minutes) but we asked for those to just be reheated (we have small kids who were DONE in the restaurant).  The medium pizza was room temp, the cheeseburger pizza didn't have the pickles on it and the kids pizza had NO SAUCE.  We were extremely disappointed.

At least the server was quick about replacing her order.  Then the deep dish pizza came which was cold.  So disappointing.  At that point our server was no where to be found. My husband barely ate any of it.  As we were almost finished with our meal our server finally showed up and took our orders for dessert.  Once the desserts arrived, another server placed the 3 desserts on our table.  The problem was the table was so crowded with our appetizer dishes that were never removed in addition to our dinner dishes.  There was very little room.  This other server didn't even make an attempt to remove any dishes, instead she set the desserts down whereever she found a spot on the table and didn't ettempt to remove any of the other dishes even though it was obvious we were done.  She started walking away and I had to ask her to remove some of the dishes.  There were no bus boys in sight or our server coming to remove any dishes.   The family that was sitting at the table next to us had left an hour ago while we were sitting next there and their table was never cleared.  It was a bit gross.  Don't think we'll be back.  Too bad because it's very nice inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=440

We were seated right away and had a wonderful, hilarious, very friendly waiter named, Michael. He joked around with us which we enjoyed his humor. We ordered our food and we asked to swap out the tomato bisque for chicken tortilla which wasn't a problem. However, we got the chicken tortilla soup first and then the tomato bisque came out with the other food.. So there was extra food that we didn't order... That's okay though. Many times during our meal other waiters came up to us and tried to deliver other food that wasn't ours. Apparently the staff doesn't know the table numbers yet.. That's fine too. No big deal. There were a few tables around us that waited a long time for their food, but not us. We had great service and left Michael a nice tip for being so kind and attentive to my Mom and I.

There wee four of us plus a one year old that we didn't order for. We ordered appetizers and a main dish which was pizza we waited like an hour before our appetizers came out then an additional hour for our pizza to come out. I usually love bjs, but this definitely left a bitter taste in my mouth. Service was horrible we waited sooooooo long for our food and when it came out was cold and completely wrong. We ordered the great white and it had no Alfredo sauce on it and another pizza we ordered with no tomatoes but they were all over it.

Michele B.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/22/2014,"Never been to this Bj's before. I have a friend that moved to Trabuco Canyon. She suggested we meet at Bjs to catch up. It's a beautiful location. Looks fairly new.  We were greeted right away by the hostess. She asked if we were members of their loyalty program. I am not but my girlfriend to my surprise said ""yes I am"". The hostess pointed to a keypad that was sitting on the desk and asked my friend to input her phone number. She did then the hostess looked up from her screen and welcomed my friend by name. I thought that was pretty cool. She sat us quickly at a nice booth for two. Our server greeted us about a minute later. I believe his name was George. He was very friendly and seemed to know his stuff. I asked about Bjs beer (I had never had a Bjs beer before). He went on about an IBU scale, light vs. Dark and hefeweizen being un filtered. It was a little over my head but definitely helped me decide what kind of beer would be right for me. I ordered a top sirloin MR. It was cooked perfectly. The cheddar mash potatoes we to die for. My friend ordered Parmesan Chicken. She let me try it. The lemon butter sauce was so good I could probably put it on anything and everything I ever eat. George was attentive and friendly throughout the experience. I noticed a young women dressed differently walking around consistently being approached by the employees. I assumed she was the manager. She seemed on top of it. I know restaurant Management can be a trying job because my Mom was one for many years. I commented to my friend that it seems managing a restaurant has not gotten any easier through the years. She told me she had spoken to that particular manager before. She said the managers at this location have recently been changed and she felt it was for the better. Upon receiving our bill George asked us if we would like to redeem any of our points tonight. I was not sure what he meant but my friend sure did. She said "" yes please"". Can I please get $25 off. He said sure. Walked away, went to the manager lady said something she walked to computer did something handed George our bill. Low and behold $25 had been taken off. I was impressed with the restaurant and my friend. Totally cool. I guarantee I will be back. Great place with great value.

Huh? The restaurant was not that busy and to run out of bar glasses? That's a first and definitely a poor excuse!  Our appetizers arrived first so we were sitting eating our appetizers but still no drinks. Finally, half way through eating our appetizers they finally brought our drinks.  They only brought three of the sample beers and said that they were waiting for one more glass.  One of my biggest pet peeve is when the waitstaff takes away dishes not asking if we are done yet.  They removed my companion's appetizer plate when he wasn't even done eating!  Another waitstaff removed our appetizers and there were still appetizers on the plate!!  So annoying!  My entree(seared ahi salad) was okay but my companion's hamburger was overdone and dry!  Management...please take note!   You will lose a lot of diners if you do not address these issues!  We have frequently dined at the BJ's in Laguna Hills and was very satisfied with the service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=420

We've been there a couple of times and last Friday night is going to be the last time I'm sorry to say. We got there shortly after 8:00pm and the place was packed. After a short wait we were seated. The waitress announced that this was her first night ""working without help"" and to ""be nice."" We ordered drinks and an appetizer. When we were first seated, I noticed a large corner booth across from us was vacant and the table was FILLED with dirty dishes, dirty glasses, leftover food, etc. We waited for our drinks ... and waited and waited. It took an inordinate amount of time for them to arrive. My son mentioned that he only saw one bartender behind the bar. Our appetizer actually came out before we got our drinks. They finally came ... one margarita, a taster of four mini beers and a rootbeer. The margarita was awful ... way too sweet and not at all like it had been the last time we'd been there. The taster of beers didn't seem to be the flavors my husband had ordered. They were supposed to be four different kinds yet two of them were identical. Dinner continued the downward trend ... my son's hamburger was devoid of any flavor and he was so grossed out by it that he couldn't stomach finishing it. My husband and I thought our tacos were just okay. I never once saw a manager walking around and they seemed to have really scaled back on the amount of staff on hand because it sure wasn't like it had been when the place first opened. The table with the dirty dishes stood there the ENTIRE time -- from the time we were seated to the time we left. Occasionally a waiter would go over there and pick up one glass or stand there and stare at the table and walk away. Apparently they have no staff who has the responsibility of clearing off and cleaning dirty tables. Toward the end as we were getting ready to leave, I noticed a lot of tables just sitting there with dirty dishes piled up. It was disgusting. I guess the wait staff was supposed to clean tables as they had time and apparently no one had time or was paying attention. Had I seen a manager, I definitely would of complained as that is just plain unacceptable! Bottom line is that we will never go there again -- it is really unfortunate that the place has gone downhill so badly in such a short amount of time.

I had a drink that was good but knocked me on my butt from being strong ( I rarely drink). I had jumbalaya- pretty good- and huge portion, could have split. My hubby had ribeye. He said his steak was meh, but he loved his horseradish mashed potatoes.  The two year old them began to loose it and the staff helped us get our bill, to go boxes and get out of there.  My favorite restaurant is mastro's, so I am used to good service....I saw very good service l around us. Obviously, the steaks are not comparable, but for the price and ability to bring the kids, this a place was great. Good, fast, friendly service with pretty good food. I don't know why the reviews are so bad....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=460
Robert K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",9,6,,1.0,11/30/2013,Horrible service and the food sucks but the manager was nice on comping my meal. So I took my family of four there today for lunch it wasn't that busy but yet it still took over ten minutes to receive our drinks. We both order the house salad with ranch and it tasted like fish  I could see the chunks of sardines in the ranch. GROSS! We both ordered the bacon burger one with cheese and one without bacon extra crispy and well done. Well the got that all wrong the patties were way under cooked and they both came with cheese and the bacon was limp and greasy. The bottom bun was filled with grease and the top hard as a rock the order of fry's tasted like fish. When we talked to the manager it was explained to us that everything is cooked in the same oil. So we sent our food back and went to Taco Bell up the the street. I highly recommend to avoid this establishment and go to the one in Irvine that one is way better!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=460
bimali b.,"Laguna Hills, CA",5,99,1,3.0,2/25/2013,"I usually love BJ's and I go to the location in Laguna Hills quite a bit, but this location was not so good. I just went there for the first time last weekend and service was horrible. The waiter, whose name I wont mention because I feel bad, was terrible. We sat at the table for awhile before we got silverwear and some of our food was already delivered (I started eating with my fingers.) The waiter seemed a bit out of it. I asked for a water which was never brought until I asked another waiter for it. They messed up my Mac and Cheese, but replaced it. The manager came over and apologized for this and they comped it, which I appreciated. And the waiter brought us the bill without asking if we wanted dessert and when I said ""can we please order dessert?"" his response was, ""oh, I didnt know you all wanted any?"" Well, then ask? He just seemed out of it and didnt pay much attention to what he was doing. The food was good, but service sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=460
Sporty G.,"Coto De Caza, CA",1,6,,1.0,12/16/2011,"very disappointed at this new BJs. the 2x i went, i sat at the bar with my friend for happy hour. first, there are not side menus telling you what the happy hour specials are. then when you can get a bartender's attention and ask them what the specials are, they act like its a huge deal for them to tell you. then they tell you extremely fast and leave. i gave them slack the 1st time since it just opened.  well, i went there the other day, hoping for better results. we sat at the bar for about 8 mins without a bartender saying anything to us, when they were right in front of us the hole time, acting as if they were so busy making drinks. it wasnt even that busy. finally, we asked a female bartender for some menu, while she was making drinks, and it seemed like it was a chore for her to do so. then a guy came around and told us his name and the other girl's name as well and said we will be happy to help you guys out; only they werent. when we asked what the happy hr specials were, again, they went over it extremely fast, like they are sick and tired of telling people what it is...then make a dang sign for everyone so we know what it is or out it on your dang menu!!!! when we ordered our drinks, the guy bartender asked for our IDs. not only did he take forever to look at them, as if we werent 21-we r well over 21-he made fun of my friend's DL picture. finally, he gave us our DL back. we dont know if he was trying to be funny or was just a jerk...later we figured out he was just a jerk... when we wanted a another drink, again, it was hard for us to even get the attention of either bartender. we didnt even bother with the female one b/c she just seemed like she hated her job, good god, would she die if she smiled?!?!?! finally, we got the attention of the guy bartender to get another drink. now im no expert in bartending, but i do know that if you see the customers  drink running low, you ask them for another before they ask you...well not here..these 2 bartenders seemed like they were not liking their job. all in all, i will not go back and sit at the bar. i will find another place for happy hour...the BEST happy hour is YARD HOUSE!!!! wish they had 1 in RSM. good news is, though, when we were getting ready to leave, a 3rd bartender came (a bald guy), and he was smiling, happy, and interacting very well with the customers at the bar...the other 2, well, they need to get out of there if they want returning customers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=460
Karen H.,"Coto De Caza, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/21/2011,"We should have read the reviews before going, but thought we would try out a new restaurant with the kids.  It was a Monday and fairly crowded.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table.  The manager came over to us a couple of times and apologized for the wait and promised a free appetizer when we were sat.  It turns out he was talking to the wrong party and there was no free appetizer for us.  The service was horrible.  Coming from someone who worked in restaurants for years and is very forgiving, this is probably an understatement.  Several people have mentioned the large number of staff and we noticed the same thing.  There are plenty of people working at BJ's.  Sadly, they are very poorly trained.  Our service was slow, drinks were not refilled, plates were not cleared and our food came out 1-2 orders at a time over about 10 minutes.  Finally, my husband and I canceled our soup orders which had still not arrived.  All the while, the manager was running around looking confused and flustered.  The food was OK, but the service killed any positive aspect of our experience.  We were looking forward to a new restaurant in our area, but we will NOT be returning to BJ's anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=460
C D.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,14,,4.0,10/29/2012,"Been there a few times. First when it had just opened and a few weeks ago. Good food, it's pricey but it's an upscale place, what do you expect? Most of the negatives just seem like people that would give 2 stars to their own mother. Really people, I know it's south OC but get over yourself. The kitchen is slow, but it's a big place and is often busy. Plus, I'm glad my food is taking awhile, usually means it's not just being heated up, but actually cooked. Service is most of the time good. Had 1 bad server, but we talked with the manager that night, and he was real cool. Other than that, the servers are good. Always telling you ""my pleasure"" which tells me management does their job and keeps them trained. The place is good, if you don't like the price, probably shouldn't eat out as it is, but most of the complaints really seem like people wanting to be pampered. We like it, and go every so often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=460
OC C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",27,19,1,1.0,2/19/2012,"While the food at Bj's is consistently good from location to location, regretfully, the service is not.  I had already lowered my standards for bad service due to experiences at other BJ's locations but the RSM restaurant sets a new low.  To say their service is slow and the wait staff is apathetic  would be a compliment.  I took my family of four there on a Sunday night.  After a 30 minute wait to be seated, it was another 5-10 before our presence was even acknowledged.   I let that slide and after ordering, things seemed to get better.  An expeditor brought out the food but after that, our family might as well have been on deserted island.  Don't go there thirsty because once you finish your first round of water, you'd be better off taking your empty glass to the bathroom to refill it.  After waiting another 20 minutes, I finally was able to flag down our server, who looked utterly surprised that I would interrupt him.  I think he forgot he was our waiter.  So I asked him to bring my son a kid's size Pizookie, which was the reason the kids picked BJ's int he first place.  15 minutes passed by and....nothing.  How long does it take to scoop ice cream and put it on a cookie?  Finally I figured we'd have to invest another 20 minutes to get the check if we waited around. So much to the dismay of my son, I flagged down the waiter again (same shocked look as before on his face) and asked for the bill.  I'm ashamed to admit that after waiting for a total of 40 minutes to even be acknowledged, i considered walking out on the bill.  Had my kids not been with me, i probably would have.  I ended up explaining the situation to the manager and he comped my kid's meals.  But the Pizookie never came out.  My son was devastated.  NEVER AGAIN.  STAY AWAY from this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=460
Ashley M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",5,14,,3.0,1/13/2012,"I have been to this new location twice. The first time I had pretty good service. However the second time I went, not so much. We got seated and it took a while for the server to come over. Being a server as well I understand things but I left thinking what the hell?! She asked for our drink order. Water with lemon please. I saw her write it down. Side salads came out...um where is my water?? I'm practically done with my salad and FINALLY the water comes WITHOUT LEMON THAT I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR. When my boyfriend ordered his pizza he asked for a side of ranch thinking that it would save her an extra trip. Of course it never came. Back to the lemons, we asked for some and asked again, and asked again. Really?!! Finally I thought it was rude that in the middle of eating my pizza she asks if I want dessert. If you really are a server you wait until your customer is done otherwise you come off as rude and trying to get rid of them. Completely unprofessional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=460
J I.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/4/2012,"I love BJ's! But this location, well definitely will NOT BEING GOING BACK. Normally my family goes to the one in Laguna. The food is always very good and I normally have no complaints but this one is ridiculous! We went on a Wednesday night when it wouldn't be that busy for my husbands birthday. We had a party of 4 and my 7 month old daughter, so we needed a high chair. When I informed the hostess of that, she seemed to treat me as if that was VERY INCONVENIENT. She kept asking if I could maybe put my INFANT IN A BOOSTER SEAT?! Is that a freaking joke?! Then she informed me that there were only certain table that were compatible with high chairs and wanted to know if we were willing to sit outside... with my 7 month old baby at 7pm. How about no. After being seated we give our drink orders and wait for about a good 15 mins to get them And just like many others have said it wasn't our server who brought them by. Finally we figured out that we needed to order and fast, so again we received our entrees from someone else but we also received the entrees and appetizers OUT OF ORDER! I can't believe the HORRIBLE SERVICE. I THINK THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB IN THEIR HIRING PROCESS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-rancho-santa-margarita-2?start=460
