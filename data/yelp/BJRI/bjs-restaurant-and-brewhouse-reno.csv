Farah A.,"Antioch, CA",30,4,,5.0,7/25/2017,"Came here for dinner around 10 pm with my family during our weekend trip to Reno. Since we visit the BJ's back home we wanted something familiar, and not as pricey as the resort restaurants. So glad we did. -No crowd, seated our party of 6 right away. -Food came out hot, fresh, and on average time. -All of our meals were delicious and the food tasted waaay better than the BJ's locations I have eaten in the Bay Area. This was my first time at BJs where I liked my meal (ordered the Santa Fe Salad). -Service wasn't overly exceptional but still great. Sam was our server and had no problem with all 6 of us and our special requests. We really appreciated that. Overall, we faced no issues, had a delicious dinner, and left with having spent a good time with the family during our staycation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno
Rachel R.,"Reno, NV",84,71,15,3.0,12/1/2017,"I'd almost rate this experience a 2 star, but the waitress and bartender were friendly enough that I felt guilty. Not to mention that they had what must have been their rudest, non-customer service friendly hostess at the front. Despite the fact they were initially super busy, they handled our order quite promptly and with a friendly demeanor.  By the time 8:30 rolled around and the busy holiday Friday night dinner crowd cleared out, the need for speed and to make tables available immediately vanished.  Fast forward, or rather painfully slow forward 30 minutes later for dessert, some thin baked cookies I could have baked in 7 to 8 minutes at most in my kitchen with a scoop of ice cream and by the time the lackluster fare reached our table, I just desperately wanted to go home! The one or should I say 2 bright spots in this experience were the server and bartender who were friendly, kind and attentive and went above and beyond to attempt to make up for any mishaps. I understand it appears they have some issues to iron out and it could be a staff shortage or another thing, but I was not happy about waiting longer for a simple dessert than the entirety of our wait time for our drinks and dinner so the kitchen manager may need to regulate when the staff takes breaks etc. if nothing else to be sure patrons don't all of a sudden get hit with an absolute stand still.  Additionally, maybe the friendly blond at the reception desk could take over greeting of patrons. She was polite, smiling and and professional when I asked for assistance and is clearly more adept at working with the public. Overall, We will be back as it is one of my local Damonte area faves, but some basic changes are in order to ensure continued customer satisfaction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno
Tracey C.,"Reno, NV",93,48,179,3.0,10/9/2017,"I use to have higher stars but lately, to me, this BJs is in need of some help. The last 3 times I have been here there has always been a problem. All I want to do is grab something yummy to eat and not have to keep returning it because of mistakes. Once everything is corrected, ya it's good but at that point I am frustrated.  One time I ordered the club sandwich, 1/2 sandwich, and they brought me out a club pizza?? Another, ordered the soup and salad lunch special and the lettuce was mushy and brown, terrible. The staff and manger are friendly and the place is always clean, a little too noisy sometimes but that is because there is always a crowd. I think I will be taking a break from BJs, just for awhile, I am sure I will be back though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno
Anna P.,"Reno, NV",97,1,,3.0,8/28/2017,"I recently went to this BJs with my boyfriend and roommate and had some issues. I have some very severe and life threatening  food allergies and am very careful about telling servers about them so I don't, you know, die. This was the first time in years that I forgot to do so, but as I've eaten at this restaurant before, I knew what to avoid so I wasn't too worried (I made sure nothing I ordered had any nuts listed in the ingredients I didn't participate in the appetizers because I was unsure about the ingredients). Out comes our food and I notice something strange--almonds, or what looked like them, on my pasta. I have my boyfriend take a bite and he unfortunately confirms my suspicions.  We immediately alert the server who apologized profusely and takes the pasta, bringing it back to the kitchen to be replaced. Luckily everything turned out fine, the wait staff was amazing, and I didn't end up needing to use my EpiPen.  Here's the issue, though--if I had taken a bite, it is very possible that something serious may have happened to me, and I definitely would have gone to the hospital. It's not too much to ask, right? That a chef doesn't add ingredients to a dish without listing it? Because if it happened to me then it probably has happened to other people. All in all I probably won't go back, not because the food wasn't delicious or that the wait staff had any issues, but because I shouldn't have to risk serious health problems when I eat pasta.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno
Nancy H.,"Reno, NV",45,60,96,5.0,9/23/2017,"My boys have a tasty night here. The fried calamari is so tasty that my oldest cannot get enough of it.

Mike B.,"Reno, NV",48,256,2392,4.0,7/2/2017,"Stopped here about 4pm on Sunday because we had a coupon. It was buy one entree, get one entree free with 2 beverages. The place was not very busy. We were seated right away. There are a lot of tables and a bar area also. We saw at least 9 big screen TV's in the place. Most had some type of sports playing. The place is dimly lit but enough to see well.  For those who don't know, BJ's is a chain restaurant with about 190 locations under a few different names across the U.S. It is based out of Huntington Beach, CA and is publicly traded on the Nasdaq. The menu is pretty extensive and features Italian based items with other American foods. They brew their own beer (about 13 varieties) and make their own root beer which my wife loves. We placed drink orders. Of course my wife got the root beer and I chose to try their own Jeremiah red. The red beer was pretty tasty. My wife ordered the salmon while I succumbed to my Italian heritage and ordered the deep dish pepperoni pizza with extra sauce, of course. The food arrived in a timely fashion. My wife said the salmon was fabulous and I loved the pizza. We even ordered a monkey bread pazooki for desert, delicious! Conner M. our server was great and kept checking on us. The food was delicious. Overall, a good experience but the cost is a little on the higher side, about $50 for two people before the coupon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno
Tabitha M.,"Reno, NV",79,139,306,5.0,10/11/2017,"I love the pizzas at BJs, and their avocado rolls. There's something for everyone here. Like beer, they have a bunch on tap and a wide bar selection. My personal favorite pizza is the Mediterranean. These pizzas are big though so order smaller than you'd think as you'll have left overs. Certain days of the week they have half price specials which are good deals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno
Nicholas B.,"Reno, NV",1109,75,933,5.0,6/15/2017,"Atmosphere If you're looking to catch the game or a few SportsCenter Highlights this is a great place for that. They have one EXTRA LARGE flat screen TV on split screen mode adorning the bar area. I was sitting in a booth about 30 feet away and had no problem being able to see or hear the sports commentary.  Food  Appetizer   Crispy Calamari This dish arrived at our table at a nice hot temperature, with the option of dipping the calamari into either the marinara or lemon garlic aioli. The calamari texture was perfect not rubbery and dressed in a light batter.   Entrée   Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe Burger I recommend this burger with two thumbs up. The sweet flavored Applewood Bacon, housemade guacamole, red onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Chipotle mayo, tomatoes, and jalapeno was a heart warming dose of deliciousness. And not the heartwarming heartburn I was expecting. Just the contrary, the heat from the jalapenos was mild, allowing you to enjoy the dish rather than being consumed by an overbearing portion of spicyness.  Served with a side of fries on a metal baking sheet one can't be possibly be required to show any restraint when consuming this all American delicacy.   Chicken Tenders with Fries One bite of the tenders fills your senses with the crispy crunchy batter followed closely by moist savory chicken. Served with a savory honey mustard​ and ranch dressing for dipping.   Triple Chocolate Pizookie  A little too chocolatey for me. I think the dish would be perfect if you substitute the chocolate ice cream for vanilla. Perhaps then the dish wouldn't have been overbearing.  Overall Like all restaurants my experience is based on atmosphere, timely service, order accuracy, customer service, and of course the food itself.  My experience at BJs hit on all notes. I will definitely be back to enjoy another meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno

I called BJ's and due to not fault of them what so ever they felt terrible and the manager Cody who was at the airport hurried to the restaurant and he personally delivered my order free of change and threw in a piezookie .

Alex C.,"Rocklin, CA",0,2,2,2.0,1/12/2018,"So we love going to BJ's, but this one has been the worst one we have ever been to. The waitress was rude, careless, and did not want to give us the time of day to even make sure we were taken care of. As for the food it was mostly good except the chicken was burnt and the pazooki was raw. I'm so disappointed in this BJ's because I've never had a bad experience at one.

The servers are always friendly here, and we haven't had any issues with our food. They're recently revamped their menu offerings, and everything we've tried has been pretty tasty.   I love using the app to put on name on the waitlist ahead of time, and do mobile pay at the end of our meal. And I can rarely resist topping the night off with a pizookie :)  I'm also a big fan of the Blood Orange Sangria, and their drink selection is pretty extensive.   Not the place to go if you're looking for quiet fine dining, but a great place to hang out and grab a bite and a beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno
Lawrence M.,"Reno, NV",6,7,5,1.0,12/24/2017,"Where to begin... we ordered the sampler platter and asked for extra marinara. I guess that was our mistake expecting them to have items on the menu. Or at least let us know that they may be out of some items when we ordered before filling the order. My date only eats boneless wings and usually this isn't a big deal as it is on the menu. But when they fill the order and bring it to the table the should not say they can't substitute items when they needed to substitute an item they had no problem making an exception. We asked for an extra side of marinara and didn't bring it but we asked a second time and the lady walked by and dropped it on the table and said ""this is the last of it"" the marinara looks like they took it off another table that didn't finish it.  At this time no manager has come to the table to discuss the issue... oh he arrived and appeared to have no idea why we would think these were issues. I wish this was the first time I had issues here. The last time I had a rude server and wrote an email to the national website.

Alyssa Y.,"Sparks, NV",462,225,151,5.0,12/1/2016,"I'm not the biggest fan of writing reviews for chain restaurants, but BJ's truly stands out.  First of all, BJ's always offers a great selection of high quality food. The menu changes seasonally and I've enjoyed every meal I've had at BJ's. My personal favorites include: wedge salad, broccoli cheddar soup, the spicy pig tavern cut pizza, California chicken club sandwich, and the salted caramel pizookie.   Secondly, the service is usually pretty good. On my last visit, Damian M. was our waiter. He was one of the best waiters I've had. He was helpful, patient, kind, and really easy to connect to. He must have filled my water glass six times, and nothing says ""quality server"" quite like frequent water refills do. Damian did an excellent job! Third, everything is reasonably priced. Check the BJ's websit before you visit because they have different deals going on pretty often. Even without a deal, the price is reasonable for every menu item.

We were told they had a 15 minute wait which would have been no problem but we ended up waiting another hour (had I known that I would have gone somewhere else because we were on a time limit) after we were sat everything started out well but servers started bringing us other people's food and when we finally got our food it was overcooked and full of grissell.

My clam chowder as always was very delicious and thick & so creamy. My husband's wedge salad was very good, the wedge itself was very fresh.  The new lemon blueberry pizzokie was much better than the chocolate chips ( doesn't mean the chocolate chips isn't good but it's just too much for us, too sweet ) this lemon blueberry was light and has a sour sweet flavor and some raisins  made it perfect.

Brandy W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",83,460,45,5.0,11/19/2016,"It's a chain restaurant, but in my opinion, the food is good. We've been to both locations in Reno and Sparks and both are great, but we like this one best (and not just because it's down the street from our house).  The pizza is legit, but I recommend deciding on that and ordering before your drinks even, because it takes awhile to cook, especially on weekend nights. A medium deep dish is perfect for our family of 4 (ages almost 3 and 5 and two adults). My kids each take down a slice and we are left with a few slices each as well. If you want leftovers, go for a large deep dish. Or if your kids are slightly older, that should do it without leftovers. They have a new vegan ancient grains soup and it's awesome. I'm vegetarian, but I thought it was delicious no matter if you enjoy meat or not. You can't go without finishing it off with a pizookie. We love the triple chocolate one. Seriously, crazy good.  Tip: Download the app and put yourself on the list so you can beat the people who come in on foot. We arrived tonight on a whim and as I waited in line, I just checked myself in before the few other parties ahead of us. We got to the front desk and I told them we arrived. We were seated before lots of other parties, which is so nice with a couple of small kids who don't like waiting! They will text you when you table is ready! And with that, it automatically adds the points to your account. And another fun tip... download the app and you get a free mini pizookie just for downloading it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=20
Kristy C.,"Reno, NV",382,626,323,5.0,5/10/2016,"Writing a review for a place like BJ's is hard and easy at the same time. It's easy because we've all been there so you (the reader) can definitely relate to what I'm talking about. You know what kind of food they serve and have probably had both good and bad experiences there.  It's hard, though, because you always want to try to contribute something new when reviewing a place and that can be hard to do when it's so familiar.  I decided to write this review after having two stellar experiences with employees, and really think that the service and attention at this location is one of the best I've had at the chain. On one visit I ordered the macaroni and cheese. It wasn't as cheesy or saucy as I would have liked, and the bartender immediately noticed I wasn't super happy with my choice. He offered to get me something different, asked if I needed anything while I waited, and I noticed that he wrote ""please add a little extra sauce"" on the computer after I ordered the chicken alfredo as a replacement. Attentive, action-oriented, and thoughtful--pretty much my favorite qualities in a bartender.  The next visit the bartender was just as attentive and thoughtful (different bartender). I expressed that I didn't like the pizza at BJ's because of the lack of sauce (what can I say, I like sauce!), and she came up with a ton of options to help us take care of that. She checked back multiple times to make sure everything came out as expected, that we were happy with our food, and was just generally really good at taking care of us. Again, excellent bar service.  You've all had the food and you've all been there before, but this way at least you know that if you go (and sit at the bar, though I'm sure the servers are excellent too) you're going to be taken care of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=20

Trebor G.,"Reno, NV",10,24,36,4.0,5/4/2017,"BJ's Brewery is one of my favorite spots to visit.  This BJ's is no exception.  The environment is pleasant and enjoyable, with a ""Sports Bar"" feel.  The Craft Beer is amazing, they also have a great selection for other drinks.  The Ahi Poki is one of my favorite appetizers to enjoy.  Kelsey was my waitress and she did a great job in line with the BJ's usual courtesy and service.  I would recommend this BJ's to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=20

I hate the fact that they always put me in an area where there are loud and noisy children. As someone who dines alone and usually has my iMac with me - I don't know how that singles children area. Nevertheless, the service was okay. My waitress had a big section that she was overseeing and the wait was a little longer than I cared for. It did give me the chance to look over the menu, as it is huge! She apologized when she arrived - so all is good there! I had the Five Meat Pizza, the mini which is four slices! It was SO GOOD! They use a deep dish pizza crust that made it tasty and good even later in the evening when I took it home, because I wanted some leftovers.  Not a bad place for friends to gather to watch the baseball game, which was on when I was there. Not sure it's the most ""Table For One"" friendly places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=20

Olivia T.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",55,2,,2.0,5/24/2017,"This was our second time coming to this bjs in town and both times we had similar problems. The first time it took close to 30 minutes for a burger and sandwich on a weekday. When the food arrived it was clear it had been sitting a while. The bread was soggy and the fries were cold.  Tried again today, a Wednesday, and received the same quality service. Ordered a pizza for my husband, I saw that the spicy pig was on tavern cut so I figured ordering a spicy pig would be specific to that style of pizza. Waitress didn't ask if I wanted tavern or deep dish. Ordered a steak dip for me. We waited for 30 minutes and watched people who had come in 10-15 minutes after us get their food. We asked what was up and they said the an jus for mine was what they were waiting for. AU JUS! Which meant yet again our food was sitting and getting soggy. Right before the food got there a spider fell in my lap!! I freaked obviously and the waitress said is it gone? And we said we think so and then she left! No apologies or empathy or anything. Food got there and I'm feeling my skin crawl. My husband got a deep dish instead of tavern cut. Wish we'd been asked what we preferred instead of having it assumed. And both of our dishes were soggy. We just asked for the check so we could leave. The waitress said ""sorry about all the stuff"" and handed us a check for $50.  We only eat out once a week so it sucks when our date night meal is crappy as hell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=60

Rei R.,"Reno, NV",321,132,181,4.0,4/29/2016,"This review rightfully begins as a cautionary tale: WATCH. YOUR. STEP. The two-step platform from the lobby to the dining room floor is a cruel mistress that's taken many a hungry patron and rushing server alike to a short but tragic tumble to the cold and unforgiving tile. Boldfaced signage and verbal warnings only go so far to help since it's such negligible steppage. Just stay sharp to avoid falling flat on your face for all of BJ's to see. Speaking from experience: don't text and walk or these steps will make you look like a certified doofus. BJ's is my guilty pleasure chain. The quality of food is always a peg above the other casual dining joints -- never mindblowing but always satisfying -- and the service at this South Reno location has always been spot on. I am admittedly a fan of their in-house brews; I've gone through enough flights to have tried them all, and they span from meh to great. The Nutty Brewnette is probably my favorite of the bunch. I'm mad for their apps: calamari and flatbread is always a safe bet. During my last visit, I brought a party of four in for a 1:30 Tuesday lunch with virtually no wait. Not as busy and not as noisy as usual. Great. I ordered the North Beach Mahi-Mahi off of the ""EnLIGHTened Menu."" This was less of a play towards being calorie conscious and more about me just wanting some simple fish. It was a hint too bland, and I'd probably love it with something other than couscous, but it was filling. The rest of the table opted to share a large pizza. Word of warning: BJ's doesn't carry ""regular"" pizzas and only offers flatbread style tavern-cut or deep-dish, so settle on one of the extremes or peruse the other entrees. As someone who swears by Lou Malnati's, I cannot fully condone the pseudo-deep-dish travesty happening here. BJ's main feature starting out was their SoCal twist on deep-dish, but their offerings just don't measure up to a true Chicago-style pie. You're serving a meat medley quiche at best, BJ's! Honestly, I'd be up in arms in angry protest... if it wasn't so damn tasty. They turned out to be out of large chicken bacon ranch pizzas, which was initially disappointing, until management came in mega clutch, offering us a medium and a small -- which meant more square inches of fake-deep-dish goodness! God bless BJ's for giving us a marginally great alternative to the unholy horde of mid-range restaurants that litter every street corner and strip mall. My only qualm is that damned step that trips me up every visit, but even then, I'm glad that it keeps me on my toes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=60
T B.,"Reno, NV",0,1,,1.0,4/2/2017,"In all, I'm very disappointed with my recent order from BJ's. I placed an order for curbside take-out. The food was delivered to me within 10 minutes of my pick up time, so that wasn't too bad. The service I received was less than stellar; not too big of a deal, but it stood out to me. Once I got home and unpackaged all of the food I ordered, the small serving sizes and (lack of) freshness of the food were apparent.  The serving sizes would have been appropriate for a young child, not an adult. The chicken tender combo was missing the dipping sauce, and the chicken itself was overcooked and dry. Not unlike something you could get in the freezer aisle of your grocery store. The French fries that came with them were also old and dry. The calamari we ordered was decent. It seemed a little undercooked and overly chewy. Lastly, the salads we ordered were so light on the dressing that they might as well have been plain lettuce.  Had I paid a fraction of what this ended up costing, I wouldn't be so upset. It's way overpriced compared to most of the other chain restaurants around here. I'd eaten here a couple of years ago and had a similarly poor experience. Lesson learned.

Chris M.,"Reno, NV",384,182,261,4.0,7/31/2015,"I was never really a fan of BJ's but I recently toured their brewery and it changed my outlook. Did you know they work with local farmers? ""Waste"" from the brewing process is picked up by a local farmer who uses it as feed for his cattle. It is a win-win because it frees up BJs bin and the farmer gets feed for his cattle! I would expect this from a mom and pop place but not from a chain. As for the food, I have a few things that have been really good. One of my favorites is the BBQ Bison Burger. At only 650 calories for the whole meal (it includes a slaw with a tangy dressing) The burger is ""topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, seared green chilies and pico de gallo and served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce."" I wasn't sure what to expect the first time I ordered it. I thought it might be dry but it was delicious and juicy. I couldn't wait to have it again so went back about a week later. On my most recent visit I ordered the lunch size Cajun pasta with a Caesar salad. This particular time the service wasn't so great but other times service has been fine. The Caesar salad was quite large so I wasn't able to eat much of the pasta but that turned out to be a good thing. I was able to get a whole other meal out of the pasta! Yum! The pasta had a ""creamy tomato sauce with blackened chicken breast, fire-roasted red bell peppers and red onions tossed with fettuccini noodles and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese and green onions."" I was impressed with the chicken. It wasn't dry at all and had lots of flavor. I'm not usually a fan of red sauce but this was a creamy red sauce and had just the right amount of heat.

My baby girl ordered the kid's mini corn dogs with a side of steamed veggies; carrots and broccoli, and chocolate milk to drink.  I was in the need for some warmth, so I requested hot tea for my drink, which came with a large lemon slice and a mini hot water pot and two tea bags on a separate saucer.  For dinner, I tried their 'new' kale and roasted brussel sprouts salad (baby kale, herb-roasted brussels sprouts, romaine, blueberries, red grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, candied pecans, toasted pepitas and red onions tossed in strawberry vinaigrette).   I did substitute the goat cheese with feta, since that's my preference.   The food came out in a timely manner, was quite tasty, and we both cleared our plates.  Our waitress was ok, she did well taking our order, bringing out our drinks, and refilling my daughter's chocolate milk.  I don't think she ever introduced herself, which is what I'm accustomed to. She didn't ask about my tea, and didn't check on us much really.  She was helpful with updating my BJ's Rewards, and honoring my e-mail for a free mini pizooki. Her service wasn't bad per se, it just seemed all business versus adding a personable touch.  Who knows, maybe she was just trying to get through a rough day, and the best she could do was her job with a smile.   Many of the tables were filled and the tv's were displaying the NFL Network, baseball, and college basketball.  It wasn't too loud, and my girl and I were able to enjoy our conversation.  I like to come to BJ's with my girl or sometimes with friends to eat and hang out.  I would recommend it for casual dining and I'll be back the next time my sweet tooth craves those pizookies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=60

I always worry when I'm handed a menu the size of an instruction manual for modem routing industrial zones! You can have anything here from steaks to ribs to wings (bone in or out) and its all frozen. This place should be called BJ's Frozen Palace or BJ's Reheated Rotisserie... The only reason they don't dump half the menu and actually cook the remaining half is that this formula works very well for this area (cheap food, thawed and served quickly in a fun and festive environment).

Every trip, no matter what city or town I was in, I couldn't find a single thing I liked! Then, I found the avocado burger! And turned 21 and found the beer section..  The girls at the front were not very friendly but you only deal with them for a minute so, no biggie.  Our server was Scott. He was so so SO awesome. Seriously, he explained the peach beer to a freakin T. He always had a smile on his face and did a great job explaining the food if we had any questions. My parents said they often have him as their server when they go and he is always that friendly.  The burger was good. Not my favorite I've ever had, but good. The guacamole was delicious, but the burger wasn't cooked the way I asked. I probably wouldn't pick to order it again, only because as I previously said, the menu is so huge I would want to try something a little different!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=40

It's a cookie baked in a deep dish pizza pan, served warm with ice cream scooped on top..... Kiss that diet good bye, cause you need to order this!!

In my opinion they taste better than the ones at Cheesecake Factory. My friend ordered nachos one time and when it came out we were so shocked at the generous amount they gave us.  We couldn't finish cause it was so filling we took it home for lunch the next day. Their famous pizookie is to die for.  I usually go for the Oreo pizookie, and my friends like the salted caramel.  I recommend getting the large pizookie platter to share with your friends (it's like $5 each if you share with 4 other ppl).  Ive also had their jambalaya, which is sooo good (a little pricier).  Most of their dishes are around $15-$20, so go for a more casual event out with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=40

Stacia D.,"Reno, NV",185,121,153,1.0,1/15/2016,"Bjs by the summit mall is usually packed, so my husband and I decided to bypass the wait and got our food to go.  He called, talked to Brooke, and ordered 2 bowls of soup and asked if they still had pumpkin ale to fill our growlers. She said they did, and that our order would be ready in 20 minutes.  When we arrived, we parked in the to go parking but decided to go in to get the growlers filled. I was super excited about the pumpkin ale, it's my favorite! We walked in the TO GO entrance and was greeted by Brooke and another young boy. There were a small group of younger teens standing there talking to both employees, but stepped to the side for their friends to help Us.  We told them the name on the order and she quickly rang it up. ""Your total is 45.34."" She proudly announced. I do not think anywhere do you fill two 32 oz growlers and get two bowls of soup does it cost 45 dollars sweet girl. Matt and I both look at each other, and said what is so expensive? She told Us the growlers were 12.50 a piece and the bowls of soup were 7 apiece and Matt's bread bowl made up the extra. I turned around to look at their very large sign that says ""32 oz growlers refills 6 dollars. I turn back around and ask her if that's still the current price. She starts laughing and says ""oh I always do that. Sorry you are right, let me go find my manager to correct this.""  She takes the growlers and scours the store to find a manager. 5 minutes later she returns and corrects the bill with her manager's slide card. No manager though. She rings Us up for 30 dollars. This seems more appropriate. I hand her my card and she prints me a receipt. She walks away to the bar to check on the growlers. She quickly comes back and hands me the menu. She explains they are in fact out of pumpkin ale.  In between trying to help Us, Brooke is busy trying to ""hang out"" with this group of friends that happens to be hanging around. Very unprofessional. WHERE IS HER SUPERVISOR??!  At this point I'm frustrated with her. We specifically asked when we called if they had the pumpkin ale and she said she checked and they in fact did. Then with all the wrong totals, waiting for her to fix it etc I almost just asked for her to give me our money back, But since we had been waiting to eat now for close to an HOUR I decided to just follow through with our original plan. My husband and I picked two other beers for the growlers to be filled with. We waited another 10 minutes and left.  When we got home we take our soups out of the bag and they aren't even luke warm. Am I surprised? No. The soup wasn't even enough to fill Matt's bread bowl. We are thinking she gave Us cups of soup instead of bowls even though we paid for bowls. From start to finish this experience was TERRIBLE! Brooke needs training!!! :( our check was wrong, we were given incorrect information, our order was wrong. Bummer.

Louis M.,"Reno, NV",95,227,375,2.0,7/1/2014,"Why haven't I written about BJ's before?  Can't really tell you why, but it was good before but not outstanding. So, unless something moves me to do so, I don't write about it. Unfortunately, something motivated me to write and it wasn't the food. First and foremost, the service was excellent..  The food, was fair to crappy. I'm disappointed in this place. On the table was a tent advertiser stating that we can call ahead and save time!  But, for the most part, when I dine, I don't want to rush in and out. I want to relax.  The dinner was a burger night. Meaning, I limit myself to one burger a month. I'm sorry PETA people, but I'm better now than I used to be.  We were seated after a short 5 minute wait. Which wasn't bad at all. The waitress came over and took our drink order. My dad got a diet soda and I got an ice tea. It arrived in short order (no pun intended) and our order was taken. The waitress was very happy and cheerful. Almost to a fault, but it was nice. The food finally came.... within a few minutes of ordering it. I would say that it wasn't even 5 minutes. Wow, that was just way too fast! It looked good. I tried a fry. It was nasty. The fries were luke cold. No really, they were only warm at best. They were soggy and just drooped. I think there's medication for that. That was my biggest disappointment.  My dad's fries were good. He ordered the wedge cut fries whereas I ordered the shoestring fries. For me, and my dad, the fries are as important as the burger.  When the waitress came by and asked how things were, I told her the fries were crappy (Yes, I actually said it that way). She asked if I wanted new fries and said yes. Less than 1 minute later, a plate of HOT fries appeared. I may be weird, but, if fries are to be served in a restaurant, shouldn't they always be served HOT and FRESH?  I was happier with this fries. Now, onto the burger. How can a place like BJ's serve me a fresh made burger in less than 5 minutes when they are at near 90% capacity? I put two and two together and realized that tent ad on the table to save time and the speed at which the food comes out meant one thing. They are trying to pump more customers into the restaurant.  Another thing. The hamburger prices are way too cheap. Most of the burgers were between $7.00 to $9.00. For a big place like BJ's? I bet you that their profitability is a teeny bit. But, if you can pump those consumers through, you can make it up. Of course there is the high margin products, such as their beer, which they are noted for and I didn't order.  So, why am I complaining about the speed at which the burger came out? Have you ever heard the phrase, haste makes waste? The burgers had to be sitting on the side. Pre-cooked. When the order would come in, the patty would get the necessary condiments and then out the door to the patron. GREASY!  Tasty, yes, but greasy. And, the fries too were greasy. Especially the sorry soggy droopy fries.  BJ's was a great place. I used to enjoy going there and the burger prices were the same 8 years ago. In fact, their prices should have gone up and kept the quality at the same level.  Instead, the prices have remained the same and the quality of the food has dropped.  -------------------------------------- Bottom line - Disappointing But, great service!!! Would I go back there? No.  Good service or not, when I go out for burger night, I want a good burger and good fries. It's only once per month, so it better be good!

It's not like it's the healthiest fare, but it's the GOOD kind of bad. I loved the Bison Burger (only like 500 calories) and it was SO worth it. The Ahi Salad isn't bad either, and I LOVE all the deep-dish pizzas. Seriously, the food is so good, I would love to come around more often, but my stomach or triglyceride levels doesn't have the ability to ingest your caloric provisions. 5 star BEER: OMG, I love your beer. Jeremiah Red, P.M. Porter, you name it, it's so freakin' DELICIOUS. But damn it, would you please sell it in stores because I can't always make it in JUST for a beer! 5 star atmosphere: Thankfully it's never been crazy loud, crazy busy, and just flat out --crazy--. If you do get busy, it's never been so loud and crowded that I felt I had to leave or else risk insanity. Of course, I do try to avoid the busiest times (who wants to wait an hour for a table?).

Kate R.,"Reno, NV",7,10,,3.0,6/29/2016,"I have been to this location a couple of times. The number one problem I have with BJ's is that it is always overcrowded. On Friday night you have to wait for a table 30 min or more. So if you like BJ's, please always call ahead and make a reservation. The food is good but nothing special. It is just another franchise menu: lots of options but nothing really stands out. Also, I have noticed that their food is always slightly over salted but I guess this is a normal thing for all franchise restaurants. The service has improved over the years but do not expect your food to arrive on timely matter. It always takes longer than usual.

First thing is first, their beers are really...really good...even their root beer which is all handcrafted, so if you're in the mood for a craft -anything, try BJ's...they even have a gluten free beer...they have an entire gluten free menu actually. There are some amazing cocktail creations that are unique and fun too, but the freshly muddled mojitos are hard to pass up. There are many appetizers to choose from, Ahi Poke, Crispy Calamari, Flatbread Pizzas. Looking for something smaller? They have a, small-bites appetizer menu as well which can I just say, with those prices you will want to try them all, and the Bruschetta is something I insist on ordering every time and the crispy artichokes are something my hunny insists on ordering every time! I could go for cocktails and appetizers and that would be a good dinner all by itself with their amazing options for appetizers! BJ's has many amazing dinner entrée options as well. Everything from Pizza's, to very large stuffed baked potatoes, to pastas...the Cajun pasta with shrimp being one of my favorites. Spicy Jambalaya, juicy burgers and even an enLIGHTened' menu with a great Barbeque Bison Burger and the BEST Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos I think I have ever had!  ""Grilled chicken breast seasoned with Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold Rub, cucumber, Roma tomatoes, red onions, feta and fresh cilantro tossed in red wine vinaigrette and drizzled with Greek yogurt crema in a chargrilled pita, served with Greek yogurt crema for dipping and seasonal bistro grains."" These...seasonal bistro grains...they speak of, I could eat a very...very large bowl of that by itself but the crema from the tacos, and the tacos, all one of the best combos ever.

Once she finally brought the drinks my friend had ordered a whisky sprite and she brought him a whisky and water so he asked her about it and she said it was probably just sitting there and watered down?! She rarely checked on us and when it came time to split the bill took 20 minutes to bring us our check. There were only 6 of us, it does not take 20 minutes to split a bill. (My friends and I work at another restaurant it takes 5 minutes to split a small check) So we went up to the host stand and payed up there and the host was so rude. It was the short red head one. She rolled her eyes multiple times and treated us horribly. We asked if we could leave the check up front and she rolled her eyes again and said ""um I guess?""

Tracey H.,"Reno, NV",0,6,,1.0,3/16/2016,"I have ordered curbside many times. Food is fine, to go salads are weak and skimpy, pizza gets a little soggy, but it's a chain and there you go. A few mistakes here and there, but not enough to cause a stir or a phone call.  Something is amiss with the online ordering system, as now twice I've ordered pizza with EXTRA cheese, which spat out as pizza with NO cheese. Yes, I am so worried about my cheese calories as I've ordered the 5 meat pizza (not). Then, now twice in a row, the boneless wings came with NO SAUCE. I chose the rootbeer glaze both times (it won't let you advance until you choose a sauce) and the wings came unsauced. I've tried to substitute crispy chicken for grilled chicken in a salad, which came with NO chicken at all. I'd had enough.  I called the restaurant this time, irritated. We spend at least $100 there a week on both dine in and curbside. After triaging with the curbside attendant over the phone, the manager, Daniel, finally decided to assist me. At first he offered to make me another pizza for free ""if you want"", so I could drive 45 minutes round trip to come get it. Um, no. Then he said obviously something is wrong with the online ordering system, so to ensure accuracy I should not use it. Um, that's why it's there? So I don't have to call and do the whole person process? Lastly, he took my email address and said he would send me a gift card equivalent to the botched items to use by the end of that evening.

The Italian/Pesto (delicious) sauce is amazing.  I have two more favorite dishes, the Buffalo Chicken pizza and the jambalaya. Both great choices. This BJ's has great service and the staff is super friendly. There has never been a questionable visit in the 15-20 times that I've been here. Darrin (the GM) does a great job with his people and place.  If there's a line for a table (which there always is), try to babysit a table in the bar area.

It is two thin chicken breasts, breaded and served with a lemon chardonnay sauce. Amazing! My mom ordered a salad which she enjoyed and my husband had a pizza, which is always good at BJs.

Jenny B.,"Reno, NV",43,94,23,1.0,4/29/2015,"I took my sons to BJ's for lunch recently.  The place was busy as there was a girls volleyball tournament in town.  Our server was Katy.  My son specifically ordered the wings with barbeque sauce.  The wings came out looking like they had been in the oven for hours, with hot sauce and ranch covering them.  When I asked Katy about the ranch (my son hadn't tasted them yet, but can't stand ranch) she told me ""They come with ranch. The photo on the menu shows it.""  Then she walked away.  My son said ""I'll wipe it off."" Then realized they were smothered in hot sauce. I called her back over.  I said ""He ordered bbq sauce, not hot sauce.""  She sighed, said they were very busy.  My son, not wanting to upset her, said he would eat them.  I said ""No, he should get what he asked for.""  Katy said to me: ""What do you want me to do""  in a very rude voice.  Her body language said she couldn't possibly be bothered by a mistake. I said ""Get him what he ordered, and leave off the ranch.""   She walked away, no apologies, nothing, just walked away.  She returned a couple minutes later with the rude response of ""My manager's taking care of this.""  Then she stormed off.   Katy was rude.  She acted like she couldn't be bothered.   My son did end up getting the wings, but with Katy's attitude I will NEVER spend $60 again on lunch for 3.   Further, BJ's really needs to add some VEGAN OPTIONS to their menu.  I only eat there occasionally because my boys really liked the food.  I usually end up paying $11 for a bowl of lettuce and a few carrots and peas. With all of the other things on the menu, you'd think that there would be a couple of good options for those of us that don't eat meat or dairy.   The only plus to this place: the beer is great.

Peter T.,"Portland, OR",102,521,727,4.0,6/15/2010,"Zipping through Reno the other day, visiting my old pal Laoman, Mrs. Laoman, and Gramma Laoman, we headed out to BJ's for a bit of lunch. I'd never heard of BJ's (the restaurant kind), but apparently they are spread across the US - there's even one in my back yard. Go figure. A cavernous space with a menu to match, BJ's offers a wide variety of foods to please most any palate, from salads, to pasta, to pizza, sandwiches, burgers. You can peruse their menu online, and find out if there is one near you, as well. We had a great meal and even greater conversation. Although I have known Laoman for longer than Mrs. BurgerDogBoy has been alive, I had never met his lovely wife and her mother. Charming folks, a lovely couple, beautiful home. I should visit more often. Or move in. Anyway, Laoman went with the personal size house special pizza, and gramma had the same sized pepperoni, Mrs. Laoman went with the sesame chicken salad, which looked wonderful, and I went with the Cuban burger. All BJ burgers start out as half-pound Angus patties, and the Cuban is dressed up like an almost traditional Cuban sandwich: oven-roasted ham, Swiss cheese, crispy dill pickles, dijonnaise and mustard. It comes on French bread, the menu doesn't exactly say that, it says ""served sandwich style."" The burgers come with crispy shoestring fries or seasoned wedges. I ate more of the strings than I should have. As for the burger? After a lively discussion about Morey's Fish House, in Motley, Minnesota, and getting frozen walleye filets delivered, Laoman asked me about the best and worst burgers I have had, and I am sure I got glassy-eyed, and said ""burgers are like women - they are all beautiful,"" before I got around to discussing BJ's burgers. ""The true test for me,"" says I, ""is the taste of the meat all by its lonesome, and I have to say, BJ's has one of the more memorable burger patties I have had in some time.""  All BJ's burgers are ordinarily cooked to medium well, but the server said I could have it anyway I wanted.  ""Raw?""  I asked. ""Sure,"" she said.  I went with medium rare, and it was cooked to medium rare PERFECTION.  PERFECTION I TELL YOU! I did not try any of their house brews, maybe next time. They have this giant-ass tank of beer outside, and I can envision me pulling a Homer Simpson, lying underneath the tank, opening the valve, and lettin' her rip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=120

I do not know if they have the lettuce resting in a bowl of water and sugar to keep it crisp or what but it was so sweet I just could not eat it.

The new rewards program is a small added bonus if you go often enough to earn a free Pizookie here & there...and almost always, the food and service are fantastic. Until last night. Service at the door and at the table were mediocre. We were in somewhat of a rush on our way to a movie, so we ordered right away. We ordered a pizza, making sure to emphasize ""no tomatoes"" and ""half no onions"", and the waitress confirmed. The pizza came, with tomatoes. We disappointedly said ""we ordered no tomatoes, but we don't have time for a new order so it's fine, oh well"". We started eating & realized there were also onions on the entire pizza. I ended up scraping off all toppings & eating plain dough. When the waitress brought the check (never checking in to see if our food was satisfactory), we informed her the pizza was all wrong & we weren't happy. She just said ""oh sorry, I wrote it down right, it's the kitchen's mistake"", took our bill & left. No compensation, no attempt to make the mistake right, so we ended up paying $50 for a crappy incorrect dinner. We'll be going to the Sparks location instead from now on...great service there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=180

Becks W.,"Reno, NV",1,34,,2.0,12/18/2013,"So my art team and I from IGT went here to celebrate out accomplishments for the whole year of 2013. We thought BJ's would be good because they have a large variety of different kinds of foods. We got there without reservations and only had to wait 3 minutes to be seated (not bad) considering the place was filling up quickly. We ordered these appetizers which weren't that great...southwestern eggrolls (copied from Chili's, but Chili's eggrolls are better because they are huge) some mozzarella sticks, a little bowl of chips with weird artichoke dip and some other eggrolls that I didn't even bother to try. There were 6 of us...and they didn't even bring out 6 for each of the foods. Dissappointing! It did take a long time to get our drinks too and most of us ordered water. So we got there at 11:40 and then we checked the time and it was 12:40....WE WERE WAITING FOR AN HOUR to get our food. It finally came and my Grilled Chichen pasta was so cold and my bosses burger and fries were cold too! Even one of the artists compained about his salad. Not exceptable! So they made our  two dinners....then forgot and then made everyone else's (Chef Ramsey would of fired the chef). We did complain and they offered to take it back....but hello...this was a celebration lunch and we have our work to get back to, so we did not have time. Then they offered desserts on the house.....UHHH...stupid...we DON'T HAVE TIME!!! They could of atleast offered 50% off the check or the meals that were cold to be taken off the check. Then we were all eating fast because of the time.  I recommend not going to BJ's with over 4 people. Very dissappointing. And if you see the place is filled up....don't even bother going in.

However, BJ's is awesome.  Every time I try something different, it's delicious.  Here are my favorites: - Chicken Fried Steak.  Their gravy is nice and peppery.  The steaks are thicker than most, more flavorful, and they aren't deep fried.  The cheddar mashed potatoes are amazing, and the vegetables are good, too. - Pizza.  Any of their pizzas are awesome.  Usually pizza in a place like this is more of an afterthought, but apparently BJ's started as a pizza place.  It carried through.  Deep dish crust is crispy and golden on the outside and soft on the inside, not too thick, and they don't overload it with cheese or toppings. - Piranha Pale Ale Chili.  They put this on quite a few menu items, and it's really good chili.   - Chicken wings.  They're not the ""tossed"" style of wing you find at some places, where they deep fry or bake the wings until they're done and then toss them in a sauce.  These are brushed with the sauce and THEN cooked, and that's how I prefer them.  Very good.  - Avocado egg rolls.  Deep fried won-ton wrappers filled with cream cheese and avocados and served with sweet dipping sauce.  Awesome? - Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  It's pounded super thin, the breading is great, and they serve it with a delicious creamy lemon sauce and mashed potatoes. The only time I was disappointed here was when I ordered a salad.  Service is always great, prices are reasonable, they have handcrafted sodas and beers, and they're open late.  What's not to like?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=220

He made suggestions everything sounded like it would awesome. This however was not the case. I ordered chicken parm, my husband Joe ordered balsamic chicken. He also ordered salad and I had stuffed mushrooms Joe is allergic to them. The salad looked really good, look being the key word it was a bit wilted and it was to sweet and the lettuce tasted odd. He thought it was his imagination he asked me to taste it. It was not is imagination. I then had the mushrooms with spinach. They were very good, I am picky because my favorite place to any kind of stuffed mushrooms another chain. Carino's in south Reno N.V. Nate came back he was very nice and fast service. He then brought out dinner. I took one bit of the chicken parm it was ok, sauce was way to bitter.Joe's was way to sweet for him we switched. It was tolerable, but still tasted funky.  We then tried desert. I will say the pazookie as the hot cookie deserts with ice cream on top very good. I had red velvet and Joe had Oreo cookie.

Also the food isnt that great.  Mass produced, high profit recipes soaked in butter.  Reminds me of Olive Garden.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=200

Jeremy L.,"Reno, NV",143,246,83,4.0,6/26/2011,"BJ's is right down from my office and very close my my house so I frequent this restaurant quite a bit. First - let's get the obvious out of the way.   If you come here right at lunch or dinner hour it's going to be busy, almost any day.   If you can wait an hour (lets say 1PM for lunch) then you probably won't have to wait. It's great that they have the bar area because if you're in a little bit of a hurry you don't have to wait be seated and can just sit down and go.   The screens aren't a huge distractor to me since unless there is a major game going on, the sound isn't being piped in. The beers that BJ's offers all taste good but if you're going there for the first time I'd recommend the beer sampler so you can try a little bit of everything. Food wise they have a lot of good food.  Personally I am a big fan of the appetizer flatbread pizzas.  For lunch especially the half flatbread pizza and salad is a decent healthy and affordable item.  OUtside of that their sandwhiches are great, their pizzas are really good (especially the bbq'ed chicken). All their salads are good and not overdressed. I've yet to have a bad meal here. It's also a great place to bring your kids (well 'tweens' and 'teens')",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=200

Their spinach stuffed mushrooms, mini bruschetta, seared ahi tuna, and stuffed potato  (Ginormous!!) weren't too bad, but none of them was spectacular (except for the beer samplers).

Loiosh T.,"Reno, NV",5,69,,4.0,6/12/2011,"Lemme sum up:  Very good beer, good food, very good service Yes, BJ's is located in a shopping mall.  Yes, it looks like any other dinner place.  But I have to second Chris R's review that the friendly and knowledgeable staff make a difference.  Plus the food and beer are a really good quality and value. My friend and I were torn on what to order for drinks.  When it doubt...get it all!  We both had samplers of the house brews.  Wow!  Do not expect that you are going to get a 2 oz pour per beer.  BJ's serves about 4 oz in mini V-shaped pilsner glasses.  Bravo!  Here's the kicker:  neither myself nor my friend normally care for dark beers, but the stout and porter are both quite yummy with no lingering bitter aftertaste.  My personal favorites:  Harvest Hefeweizen (notes of cardamom), Nutty Brewnette (is that pecan?!), and Jeremiah Red (Danger! Goes down way too easy. Thank you, sir, may I have another?) Dinner was very good as well.  My friend, who is a meat and potato man couldn't stop raving about the Chicken a la Fresca.  It did look good and he devoured it before I could get a bite to taste.  I went with the Piranha Pale Ale chili in a bread bowl.  I was very happy that the bread bowl actually contained a good two cups of the chili.  The chili itself was meaty with an equal portion of beans to meat.  The top piece of bread that had been cut out to create the bowl was covered with cheddar and parsley and then broiled...nice touch! Do you believe we had room for dessert?  Well, it was to share so I don't feel that bad.  The Pizzokie was good but nothing to write home about.  Standard chocolate chip cookie in a six inch tin with two scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Just right for two people to share.  I do like that proceeds from each sale go towards charity.  There...I'm sure that burns off some of the calories, right? Overall, I'm looking forward to my next visit to BJ's.  They offer quality food at a decent price.  The service we received was really very good.  And I'm dying to try their NitWit.  *elbows you*  Yeah, yeah...takes one to know one, eh?  *laughs*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=200

It sucked a bit since my kids were with us. Whining was had. Then they came around offering samples of pizza (a slice from a personal pan). That wins a point in book for quieting the hungry kids.  The wait time was about right, and then we were seated. Our server was nice and attentive, but the kitchen end was slow. Painfully slow. Annoyingly, painfully, disgustingly slow. Slow enough that my kids started whining again between cheese sticks and main course. From the time we arrived to the time we left it was nearing 2.5 hours. That's a little longer wait than I expect in a restaurant like this (it's a burger and beer joint after all).  The food was not blow my skirt up good or anything. The root beer is damn tasty though.

I do like the food.  I can't think of a time I've been disappointed with it...  The pizzas are wonderful (though they do take awhile; order a salad to start with!), the salads are great, the sandwiches are decent, and the pasta dishes are delicious.  Not a huge selection of desserts (who doesn't have cheesecake???), but what you can get is good.   Be prepared for a wait if you go Friday or Saturday night!  They do sometimes offer samples of their food (typically pizza) when they know they're telling people long wait times; that's always nice.  I recommend trying BJs, but I'm only giving it 3 stars because service issues are my big pet peeve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=240

The menu never really changes. 3. None of the food has been spectacular. Fine, but not spectacular. 4. Servers seem to not know a lot about drinks - I ordered a Black & Tan, was asked about it a few times, had to describe it, and was ultimately delivered a Guinness.

My son used to love their cheese pizzas and would finish the whole thing. This time, he only had a few bites. There was no tomato sauce or paste on the pizza. THe pizza was dry. My sister and mom and dad really wanted a deep dish pizza, but they ran out. So, My sister and my mom and dad had the hand tossed vegetarian pizza. My mom was like, something's missing.

I have yet to find a favorite meal. But The pizza is good, and avocado egg rolls GREAT a must try! * Get there early in the afternoon/early evening.

The third time they ""comped"" the second salad that shouldn't have been on there in the first place.  Waitress was apologetic.  Manager didn't come over once even though we said we were considering not  returning.  So sad...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=260

Sarah R.,"Seattle, WA",79,320,37,3.0,3/20/2008,I have been to this place a handful of times.. and I haven't branched out since the first time.  The first visit I tried the appetizer egg rolls (disgusting) and was so disappointed. My friend had ordered BJ's favorite pizza and she was loving life. (despite the fact that they originally brought her pizza to the wrong table.. and it took over 30 min to get it. Her boyfriend and I had finished our dinner. They comped the meal) I took a bite of hers when it finally arrived and was sold. There's a reason it's the favorite.. it's awesome. Normally I don't go for meaty pizza since I am not super big on meat.  But damn. The service each time was just ok. Nothing extraordinary. They did bring my brother a nice desert when we had this birthday there though and the atmosphere is very comfortable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=260
Ketohu S.,"Reno, NV",0,3,,1.0,6/7/2011,"You know I've come to the conclusion that BJ's just doesn't care about their to-go order customers. I've gone to BJ's and enjoyed myself at the bar and with friends. But To-go is a no-go. They have pretty good food but the to-go service is $h** This is the 2nd time in a row they've screwed up my order at two different locations. The first time the girl who took my order neglected to ask which pork chop dish I wanted and just ASSUMED, which of course she got wrong. The manager offered to get me a drink which I accepted, and then he conveniently forgot about it. 20-30 minutes Later I get my food. Finally. The next time I order Spaghetti with meat sauce. I go around the mall for at least 20 minutes. I thought it would be ready by the time got back, especially considering they said 10-15 minutes when I left. Of course it's not ready. The manager said they made it for here instead of to-go. Of course he offers me a drink which I decline considering I might be waiting another 45 minutes before he gets to it. I get my food. Later on I start eating and WOW this pasta is hard! Meaning basically, they forgot about my order, cooked it as fast as they could and lied about making it for here. I'd like to give it 1 1/2 stars but nope. If you go, just eat it there. To-go from BJ's DON""T DO IT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=260

Tina G.,"Lincoln, CA",5,4,,5.0,5/27/2014,"We scheduled a group party with very little notice at this establishment to celebrate my daughter's graduation from medical school. We had approximately 30 people and brought in our own cake. We ordered various appetizers, salads, pastas and entrees from the catering menu and asked that it be presented buffet style rather than family style for this event. The food was fabulous and the quantity far exceeded my expectations - we took home so much food. The atmosphere was great and very conducive to conversation and fun. The servers were not only polite but friendly and comfortable to have around. They set up the buffet beautifully and even helped serve the cake which we didn't even purchase from them. Our party was such a success that we nearly overstayed our 2 hr time limit without being aware that the time was over and we hadn't even cut the cake. They made concessions for us, allowed us to have the cake and finish up. We felt no pressure to hurry. The manager was so helpful and the staff just fabulous. They packaged up our leftovers nicely while we finished the cake and when I paid the bill, I was so surprised - we definitely got our money's worth. I would most highly recommend this restaurant for their food and their staff.

Typical brewhouse fare.  My wife loves the buffalo chicken pizza but it just doesn't agree with me. I suppose some of the appetizers aren't bad..and the crusted chicken is ok.

Kristy K.,"San Francisco, CA",4,19,,1.0,12/24/2008,"I had THE WORST service experience of my dining career at this restaurant. It's been about a year and a half since I had my lovely experience, so maybe the service is better, but I will never go back. Now, the story: We arrived and there was a wait, no big deal, so we decided to wait in the bar. The service in the bar was fine and the hostesses sat us as soon as they could, no complaints with these aspects of the service. However, I cannot say the same for our server once we sat down. She came and took our order and then everything went downhill. I had ordered an appetizer to share with one of my friends, we expected the service to be slow, but we never received our appetizer or saw our server. We asked the woman who brought our pizza, I'm assuming the food runner, and she had no clue, our server didn't come back after we had asked. We decided to ask one of the hostesses where our server was as we had no idea what she looked like. After all, we had only seen her once. Finally, our server came back to our table. She was clueless as to the fact that we didn't get our appetizer then proceed to launch into a speech where she called the chefs/cooks in the kitchen ""RETARDED""  and explained that we should really come back on a Tuesday or Wednesday because that's when they are okay. (Really? You can only eat at this restaurant 2 out of the 7 days in a week?) This was quickly followed by ""and don't ask the host staff anything because they're retarded too"". All 5 of us at the table were completely shocked by her speech, I would think the owner would be mortified to know that these were the explanations given by one of his staff members. Then after the appetizer STILL didn't come, we again had to flag her down to tell her that we simply didn't want it anymore (assuming she had put the order through in the first place). She came over to our table with an empty, dirty glass from another table. When she left the table, she left the dirty glass sitting right next to me. At this point, I really thought that maybe I was on some sort of TV show where they test your patience. The manager came over and gave us free dessert, blah blah blah. As we were getting ready to leave, we all decided that we were still pretty disturbed by the whole ""retarded"" speech so one of the members of my group decided to let the manager know why we were not leaving a tip. He took the check over to her while the rest of us waited by the door. As we were waiting, our server walked by a few times and then finally came up to one of us and asked if she had given us our bill. SERIOUSLY? This is the most clueless server I have ever met, with absolutely ZERO people skills who should never be waiting table because she can't seem to figure out which way is up or down.  Because of this ridiculous experience, I am giving BJ's 1 star, if I could give it 0, I would. The food really wasn't very impressive and the service was beyond horrible. I guess it's not fair to judge an establishment based on one employee, but I really can't bring myself to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=260
Christy W.,"Erie, PA",7,42,3,4.0,7/6/2009,"I went to BJ's late last night and they were seemed happy to serve us.  I have always enjoyed their beers and the staff seems pretty knowledgeable.

Bill T.,"Carson City, NV",1,4,,2.0,2/27/2011,"Driving back home from Reno back to Carson City as my wife and I decided to try BJ'S Restaurant  and Brewhouse for dinner.  I was actually excited to try  BJ'S  out as I've not eaten at this restaurant before it looked great from the outside but was less than impressed with the service and food. We had proceeded to order as the server came to take our order started with soup and salad but couldn't start till napkins and silverware was asked for , no smile or even a simple your welcome. Normally with soup I would like to be offered rolls or even crackers but as I asked the reply was"" we don't usually give it out unless you ask "" I would hope that maybe instead of waiting for the guest to ask that  the servers would be first to inquire as part of guest service. I had the new item gilled center cut pork chops and my wife the Grilled chicken and sesame asian salad. I must say the pork chops dish and salad display was fantastic but now the taste well the pork was a bit dry with not alot of flavor however the second pork chop was cooked much better don't know why but it was. The salad was very tasty  once we had more dressing. Overall I would like to say We were a bit dissapointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=280
V A.,"Incline Village, NV",0,3,,1.0,12/27/2009,"BJ's is a chain restaurant that I've eaten at in a few states. Came in for lunch on a Wednesday with a friend and her baby son. Hostess sat us right away. The waitress got us menus and got our drink orders in. We ordered potato skins, a pasta dish, and a sandwich for lunch. We asked to get the potato skins before our meals.  We had to ask our waitress twice on the status of our food of which she answered that it would be up soon. The restaurant wasn't slammed and she only had a few tables that seemed to get their food earlier than us. We were polite and not rude to her but she deliberately neglected us. It took 45 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food and she completely forgot our potato skins. To make things worse, my friend ordered a lunch plate and got the entree plate instead. To make matters worse, our food came out cold.  We were annoyed and didn't want to wait another 45 minutes so we sucked it up and ate what they brought out. I politely asked her to remove the skins order from our check which she did and with a huff left our table without even an apology. As we neared the end of our meal, she suddenly became more attentive and asked us if everything was alright. She finally realized that her tip amount was in jeopardy and tried to make up for her lack of service during and prior to getting our food. We got the check, and I paid and left her a 15% tip. I normally tip 20% minimum but her service sucked. My friend told me not to leave her anything but that would have been rude and I would have been playing the waitresses game. We complained to the manager who neither apologized or even seemed to care.  This seems to be typical of all restaurant personnel here in Reno. Hence, why Reno is still just a small cow town and not a real city. The only places where the service is just superb is The Steakhouse at Harrah's or Bistro 7, otherwise every joint that call themselves a restaurant in Reno just lack in providing any quality service. It's ironic because the heart of Reno is it's service industry.  I would not recommend BJ's at the Summit at all. There are other brewery/restaurants in Reno that provide a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=280
Tracy S.,"Reno, NV",344,683,631,1.0,3/10/2008,"I have been a big fan of the BJ's in Belmont Shore for many years.  In fact, that location is so good and so cool that I never even knew it was part of a chain until one opened in Reno.  So finally Husband and I decided to take the long trek out to the far south end of town to eat at our own, local BJ's.  What a HUGE disappointment!!  Just.  Horrible.  First of all, it has become an atrocious chain restaurant with all of the chain marketing bullshit all over the place, and the chain design of fitting hundreds of people under one huge roof, packed together like sardines.  I'll hit Olive Garden if I want THAT kind of dining experience!  The service was too fast and too sloppy, and while we were rushed through our meal we got the pleasure of watching the server at the table next to ours spill an entire tray of drinks all over her diners.  The house salad, for which we were charged a mind-boggling $5, had obviously been sitting in the fridge all day, and was just a handful of dried-out iceberg with a few strands of carrots.  The pizza--the same pizza I love in Belmont Shore!--was atrocious.  Truly, I could microwave better pizza than that.  I imagined that somewhere in the kitchen somebody WAS microwaving pizzas.  If you want a brewhouse, go to Silver Peak or Great Basin...this place is the pits!!  You are warned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-reno?start=280
