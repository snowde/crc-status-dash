Anthony N.,"Sacramento, CA",415,57,585,5.0,12/26/2017,"This review is solely for our waitress we had encountered on Christmas Eve. I am big on customer service, so when I experience amazing customer service I love to give kudos, in hopes of  that employee receiving some recognition.  On Christmas Eve my family and I decided to go have some dinner and drinks, upon being seated we were greeted by our waitress Amelia. (Name may be misspelled). She was very approachable, sweet and genuine. She was very attentive to us and even chimed up with some conversation as well as suggestions. A couple people's food at our tables came way after the rest of us, maybe they forgot about us, but Amelia was apologetic and even comp us on some of our meals. Throughout the entire night she was very attentive, always coming by and seeing how we were doing. I greatly appreciate that type of service. I normally sit at the bar when I visit, but next time I may try and get one of her tables again. Hey, doesn't hurt she's a cute girl as well. Lol. But in all seriousness, she represented Bjs well that night, so hopefully her management team reads this and can give her some kudos as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6
Dave T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,,2.0,1/12/2018,The King of Overrated. Everything is bland... Food. Beer. Wait staff. Why do so many people come here? If Dennys sold beer your taste buds wouldn't be able to tell the difference,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6
Tami K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,23,2,1.0,12/4/2017,This place has gone downhill!  We used to love going here but I think we probably won't go anymore.  The last straw was this past Saturday.  We had family over and my husband wasn't feeling well so I recommend take out from BJs.  I had ordered the bison burger and upgraded my fries to sweet potato. The burger was bland (I get bison at other places so I know what a good one should taste like) and all the fries were pretty much burnt.  Glad I paid extra for burnt fries.  Someone ordered the mushroom burger and there were so many she took some off.  My husband ordered the ziti which he normally loves but he said it was like it wasn't cooked thoroughly.  Not sure if they have new cooks or management but this place is bad. It's a shame as there isn't a lot of options in Natomas.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6

Bad S.,"Sacramento, CA",1,95,8,1.0,11/28/2017,"Sadly I have learned to have lower expectations when I visit Bjs. Tonight was no exception. The notable moment was when my wife brought to my attention that her Maui tacos tasted rotten. At first I dismissed her complaints. I grabbed a big piece of fish out of her taco and took a big wiff..ugggghh! Spoiled fish! We complained to server then I proceeded to go to the restroom to wash my stinky hand. Scrubbed deep with soap. Manager took responsibility and offered soup or whatever we may want. My wife, kinda ill after eating a bite of rotten fish, said maybe a soup.  Bill came, thanks for the 6.99 soup! Way to make it up... And my hand still stinks like decaying fish!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6
Veronica S.,"Sacramento, CA",132,279,415,4.0,9/16/2017,"Such a great place for happy hour! Myself and a friend decided to come here after work one day and loved it. Their cider is delicious, I just wish they sold it to go :(  We ordered 2 beers each, avocado egg rolls, the spinach dip and queso and ended up paying around $16 each total. Really great deal. Their happy hour is also goes later than most places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6
S M.,"Rocklin, CA",71,6,2,3.0,1/9/2018,"So this is the first time I've ordered curb side from bj's which is a great service when I have a kid that I don't want to bring into a restaurant while tired and it's raining. BUT After being unable to find the curb side spot to park, I called the restaurant and she said ""you see the trash can behind and to the side of the restaurant ya you're supposed to park there"" umm ok all I saw was handicap parking she said ya it's on the other side of that. Well shit why do you guys hide the pick up spot? Why not just put it in front of the restaurant or at least have a big sign not one screwed to a hand rail. That's just silly. Otherwise I love bjs the waiter that came out was very nice just thought they could improve their curb side spot so 4 stars for today's visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6
William L.,"Sacramento, CA",1745,1258,9492,4.0,9/8/2017,"For three visits in a row so far as of 9/1/2017, this BJ's at North Natomas takes the cake perfectly for serving their finest quality eatable foods and impressive drinks every day and night no matter what the special occasion is! The atmosphere and the concept remain the same as most BJ's has across America, and for this Natomas location didn't dissapoints! Much spacious and roomy unlike the Elk Grove and Arden/Arcade location has, and it's averagely busy depending on the environment during lunch or dinner. The employees here are doing an alright job for making the customers like me a fine service. I wish this service needs to be more friendly to the customers next time despite the busiest environment. As a result for me, no cons. Now onto the food! During my lunch break, I usually ordered one of my favorite dishes from BJ's called, ""Lemon Thyme Chicken."" As I ate it, it tasted very good although it was kinda nearly salty for my tastebuds. The cause for being close salty is the brussel sprouts. I'm sure they should reduce the salt content for the vegetable sides of the Lemon Thyme Chicken. The rest of them were also tasted amazing! The chicken breast did cooked perfectly without being too harden and nearly raw. Not a bad meal! There's plenty of parking spaces available, so you can park anywhere you want near or far. In the end, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse at North Natomas is a fine, remarkable national casual restaurant that I've ever visited. A fine visit indeed. My rating: 4 solid stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6
Vickie W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,26,33,4.0,10/8/2017,"A late dinner to BJ's never disappoints. We were celebrating two years cancer free for me.  We started with the root beer ribs. My only complaint was there were not enough, just kidding we each ate three along with a spicy coleslaw. My husband ordered the seared ahi salad and remarked it was the best prepared although he has enjoyed it before. I chose the parmesan crusted chicken with steamed broccoli and white cheddar mashed potatoes. On the side wad a caprese salad. I was not disappointed. We topped it of with the strawberry beignet. Makayla was a fantastic server checking back with us several times to see if we were pleased with our choices and fill our drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6
Jasmine H.,"North Natomas, Sacramento, CA",0,4,3,3.0,12/22/2017,"Two stars for take out! An extra for getting the food out within ordering 40 min before closing. Usually BJs is pretty decent, today was our first and last time ordering takeout. I was craving the Thursday special despite having a full seafood meal a few hours before. We got a full rack of ribs (the ribs itself was great) special. My favorite- mozzarella and tomato salad had seen better days.... IT DIDN'T EVEN INCLUDE THE BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE, my favorite part :(.   The potato fully loaded was subpar, but how could you mess up a potato. The broccoli... I didn't understand I usually LOVE ordering bjs broccoli for every meal, but this just didn't cut it, it tasted of mush. Now onto my macadamia pizookie..... hard as a rock! I enjoyed my ice cream though :) Nonetheless, I won't be ordering out but it was worth a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6
Hinna A.,"San Francisco, CA",3,25,1,1.0,11/28/2017,"Wow. What a horrible night we had last night. Our party of 5 walked in around 10:23pm last night, with two kids (under two). Their was probably around 10 people in the whole place. Placed our order and waited 20-30 mins before our food finally showed up.  1.Salad was missing dressing, croutons. 2.Fries Stale. 3. Avacado rolls soggy and salty. 4.jalapeno burger came with NO SAUCE. No mayo, menu clearely states it comes with Chiptole mayo.. mine was plain. No jalapenos as requested, no fried onion strings as requested. Asked for it to be re-made, manager comes over to apologize and offers to comp the burger. Well, guess what?!?! we had to wait over 38 mins for a new one. Are you kidding me? unprofessional half assed management with shitty food. Honestly, with a 8 to 1 staff to customer ratio, why did it take almost 2 hrs to make a burger correctly? I wish this location would get its shit together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6
Lene N.,"East Bay, CA",1432,853,4293,3.0,1/17/2017,"The only thing consistent 'bout the chain of BJ restaurants' is the menu, other than that customer service is either good or bad- nothing in between.  The fambam decided to stop here after our long drive from Reno. After sitting in a car for almost 4 hours, our starving bellies needed food- STAT! Thankfully we were seated right away and a plus is that they were playing the Warriors Game on a tv nearby (funny to see, we were the only table cheering when GSW scored, LOL).  Our server, Robert showed up to take our drink orders shortly thereafter. If you're looking for the a friendly, personable server - then Robert may NOT be the server for you. We weren't expecting a bubbly personality, but at least a smile. He comes off cold, almost with an attitude like he doesn't want to be at work. Weird.  Our food orders were placed then the wait game began. After watching almost 2 full quaternary of basketball, it started to dawn on us that the food was taking FORever. One of the ""managers"" finally came out to inform us that there was an issue that has since then been resolved and our food will be out shortly. A few minutes later my food along with my 'rents food came out, yet my hubby's food was still MIA. After what felt like 10 minutes from the initial manager, a second manager came out to inform us my hubby's food will be comped and will be out shortly. The wait was ridiculous.  In regards to the food, the temperature could have been warmer but at that point we just wanted to eat then get the heck outta there. The lemon thyme chicken was good; it came with brown rice and veggies. The lemon pepper chicken wings were good, with a nice crunch. My mom's penne shrimp dish was okay, could have used more sauce - but the garlic knot was good. My hubby's salmon was overcooked, but was served with tasty quinoa.  In conclusion, if we're ever in the area driving back from Reno to the Bay - we will just stop at In&Out. That was our original choice for dinner, and plus I can't remember the last time I had a ""bad"" In&Out burger...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6
Keyara C.,"Anaheim, CA",55,4,6,5.0,12/3/2017,The bartender I had last night should be manager. She made sure we were taken care of and made my drinks perfect.

There's a reason we keep going back to this place.   I love the appetizers (try the sriracha brussel sprouts, so good!), the pizza is really good and one of my favorites are the grilled mahi mahi tacos!  My son and I also really enjoy the pizzookie, and the option to order one with half and half flavors makes it easier to share!

Amanda D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,109,18,1.0,6/9/2017,"BJs, BJs. What happened? I feel like BJs is a boyfriend where we had some amazing times and then you find out through mutual friends that he's a jobless alcoholic. We haven't been to BJs in months and our experience tonight left us sadly very disappointed.  Our appetizer order of chicken lettuce cups tasted like some cut up chicken with a bottle of soy sauce poured over the top. It's was just pure sodium.  Next came my husband's clam chowder in a bread bowl. Except it came out in a regular bowl and had to be sent back, which took another 15-20 min. When he did get it back, he said that it tasted very fishy.  My chicken Cobb salad was inedible. I waited 10-15 min after it was brought out to get the salad dressing. The chicken tasted canned almost like the chopped stuff you get in the tuna fish cans.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=80
Kate B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/21/2017,"One of my favorite BJ's locations in Sac, the food is somewhat consistent here. Though if it's a busy night, be prepared to wait a long while for the food to arrive. I have been here a lot, and the only thing that irks me is that when I ask for extra garlic knots to go with my pasta, some servers here will force you to pay extra, while others are gracious enough to give you extra for no additional cost.   Also, if you order pick up, make sure to double check all food they give you, because they have a tendency to ""mess up,"" which will require you to drive back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=80

Roger M.,"Sacramento, CA",61,94,63,2.0,10/31/2016,Out with my wife for a Halloween dinner date. Got our drinks ok. We ordered our dinner my wifes was good but my rib eye sucked. Asked for it med well and all i could taste was the burnt meat from the grill. Only could eat half of it before i had enough of the burnt taste. I had to ask the server twice for butter for my dry baked potato. The asparagus still had the ends on them.

Tony M.,"Sacramento, CA",1,10,,2.0,7/18/2017,Went here with my brother and nephew as i know my nephew enjoys this place. The beer on tap was limited for a so called brew house. It took way too long to have our order taken and get some beers - it was not that busy as we went after the lunch crowd. Food came and our waitress didnt come by to check on us until our meal was almost finished asked if we wanted another beer but didnt ask how the food was - i wasn't impressed with the food. i had a grilled cheese  with soup. the sandwich was greasier than the french fries and salty - it was terrible!  the clam chowder was like gravy you put on biscuits i didnt finish any of my meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=80

She told us our waiter/waitress would be right with us. 10 minutes later still no waiter so we approached another waiter who was serving tables nearby and they said they'd get someone to take our order. Another 10 minutes pass and still no waiter or even waters at our table.

Adam A.,"Sacramento, CA",12,12,19,4.0,5/24/2016,"It's been to long since I've eaten here, that being said I this is a restaurant you have to try at least once. I had dinner with my mother and despite the crowd of people waiting for a table it only took five mins to be seated.  Here is the only thing negative i can say about BJ's is how cramped you feel. ""Who are you and why are you in my lap"" is how i feel some times.  Despite this the noise isnt that bad and you can have a conversation with your party without having to yell. Ok to the good stuff. I had a small pizza, half Great White and half Spicy Hawaiian Chicken, with a sample of the BJ's PM Porter and BJ's Tatonka Stout.  The Great White is my favorite pizza here.  Skip Round Table and get a BJ's Great White every time. The Spicy Hawaiian was good but when you say theres bacon on my pizza i better taste it!  Between the Porter and the Stout i would recommend the porter. Think Guinness light. The Stout was a little heavy for my taste. Overall it was a great meal.  P.s.  Sorry to call you out BEN!  You where a great waiter. Fast, funny, always had a smile, and super hot.

I don't drink alcohol but all my beer buddies concur that their beer selection is excellent and served properly...that's good enough for me. The menu is a bit extensive but that is one of the beauties of this place, there's something for everyone AND they do it all well. Pizzas are a pretty big seller here; many different types from flatbread to deep dish, they are all very good. Pasta dishes and sandwiches are tasty and always perfect. The burgers or also on point.    The service for this location is better than the Arden location and superior to the Elk Grove location. There is always staff willing to help and I have never had them say ""I'll get your server"" they handle it.    I've been to a few large parties here and the service is still top notch. The west side of the restaurant can be closed off giving your party some privacy and much quieter room.

Terryann T.,"Sacramento, CA",38,71,70,4.0,9/14/2016,"This is an updated review, after 2 reviews. I had a couple of bad visits and after addressing these with the manager, Isaac, we came back again the other night for a family dinner. They were just starting to get busy and so service was slower but it could have been worse. My uncle was disappointed that they couldn't get the Warriors game lol but again no problem.  We got our drinks and ordered our food. Unfortunately there was a special on the large pizzas and they had run out so my brother and his wife were going to share a medium pizza instead. Our appetizers came out and luckily we shared those because there was an issue with the pizza, as apparently someone had forgotten to put in the order.  I have to admire the way that our server, Robert, delivered that bit of bad news. The manager also came by and apologized and offered them (my bro and his wife) some salads as the pizza was still being made. They accepted his offer and my mom ended up sharing her pizza with them. They got their pizza for free because it was so late and they opted to get it to go.  I'm definitely glad we came back again. It wasn't without its hiccups but it was not a horrible experience and we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=20

And yes, I almost slipped again. I saw my waiter 2 times this night. Once was to order and the second time was to pick up my check. I wanted to order more drinks and asked the person who brought our food over if I can order drinks since my waiter was no where to be found. He said he'd go find out waiter but that never happened.

Kristina T.,"Sacramento, CA",74,209,673,4.0,12/26/2016,"Early on during the week, my girlfriends and I decided on doing a get together dinner at BJs on a Friday. Being occupied with Christmas two days away, it did not occur to me that I was having dinner during one of the busiest nights, Friday. Though there were plenty of parking available pulling into the lot you would not know there were so many people waiting to be seated inside. Luckily, some of my friends arrived before me and were able to add our names to the list. Thank goodness the wait wasn't dreadful because it was packed and no where to sit; standing room only. Lol. Btw, waiting outside wasn't an option because it was freezing! Not more than 15 minutes later our party was seated.  Our waiter's name was Sergio. He was great, very approachable and funny. He was also prompt on getting things we asked for too, I wish all servers can be efficient like him. Anyways, we started off by ordering some alcoholic beverages because sometimes the Holidays can be rough. My drink choice was the Piranha Pale Ale which was good being that I'm not a drinker. Along side our drinks we had avocado egg rolls, siracha brussel sprouts and the calamari for appetizers. The egg rolls were good but too spicy for my liking and surprisingly the brussel sprouts were really good. For the main entree I had the chicken alfredo. When I ordered my meal I did tell Sergio that I wanted extra sauce but when my dish arrived at the table, it was still dry. I had to ask for more sauce and by that time I was over my meal. So I packed it to go and my kids enjoyed it. Haha. Like any other BJs, I can't leave without eating a pazookie! Lol. For the 5 of us, we ordered the party platter pazookie which is around $22. It was definitely cheaper than getting individual pazookies @ $7-8ea. We were able to choose up to 4 flavors; Oreo, macadamia, salted caramel and good ole chocolate chip. I could do without the salted caramel and Oreo though, it's way too sweet. When given our check Sergio was able to split it up by meals for us which was nice and effortless to pay and tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=20

Nanise N.,"The Pocket-Greenhaven, Sacramento, CA",51,3,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Tonight I experienced nonexistent customer service. We had a party of three, one being a toddler, when we arrived there were two parties ahead of us. The hostess took my name and said it would be about 10 mins, we went in at 10pm. It was a little busy, but all the other parties waiting were large. I figured this was the reason for only a 10 min wait because we were a small group. Between 10 and 10:30pm I watched 4 different groups be seated, 3 of which were groups of 3 who had checked in with the hostess after us. Finally at 10:32pm, the hostess looked at me and says, you're still waiting, I replied, ""yes, we are"", we were seated then.  By 10:45, almost 15 mins after sitting down, not a single employee came over to greet us, bring us water, or even say someone will be right with you. NOTHING! NOT A DAMN THING. When we got up to leave a waitress turns around and says have you been helped. I told her, ""no, we're leaving."" At the hostess station I asked to speak with a manager, explained him the situation and how horrible the customer service there is. His response, ""I'm sorry, thats all I can do for you."" I see where the employees learn their skills from. I wish I got his name, I was just so mad I wouldn't be enjoying my pizookie, I will never go back!

I'll be honest, I'm not really a fan of the food but it was my niece's graduation and she picked it so off we went.  We precalked in a reservation for 9 people and still had to wait an hour to be seated...  Once we were seated, I ordered potato skins and they came promptly with one set of silverware that I grabbed. I was lucky able to use the spoon for my skins and on my ranch.  My sister ordered wings as an appetizer and they came or shortly. I grabbed one with my fork, dipped it in the ranch and ate it. Then I grabbed a second one, took a bite and looked at it on the fork, and almost vomited, the fork was so dirty with multiple pieces of lettuce stuck to it. I took it to the counter showed the staff and a manager came out to apologize. Then they had me fill out an incident report.  In addition to that, my cousin's burger tasted like it was made out of salt.  My steak was so fatty and gross and well done I could only give it to the dog.  My little cousin who ordered of the kids meal, her mom was charged for the (included) drink.  My daughter requested an easy cheese pizza as she does not like meat (not allergic just preference). They brought extra cheese and pepperoni, we scrapped everything of and she ate the crust. The experience will not be repeated by me at that BJ's or any other because of what happened.  The cherry on the top was when one of the hostess said to me when I asked for clean silverware to replace my filthy set said, ""the fork went thru the sanitizer washer so you don't have anything to worry about."" I explained that it doesn't matter how many times you sanitizer it, if it's not clean, it's not sanitized. Edit: After I posted this review I was contacted by BJs and give a $50 e gift card. I will go back and try another location.  Edit: I went to the Laguna Beach location with just my daughter for lunch. The service was adequate as was the food. The view was awesome!

We stood there ... and stood there ... and stood there ... for at least 7-8 minutes... less than 10 feet from the bartender. He never made eye contact or acknowledged us. He was too deep telling some story to the patron. We finally left, headed back to the host station and asked to be seated in the restaurant.

I actually had to get up after our food was delivered and walk across the restaurant to get someone to bring me water. Originally the waitress took 20 min to bring two waters and a beer to our table then never came back to being more water or offer new drinks.  She finally came back to our table to take our order but was very short and had no sense of urgency or care at all. We had a party of 7 you would think she, at the very minimum would care about her tip, but she didn't. We ended up tipping two dollars only because we couldn't walk away giving her nothing. Our food was cold like it had been sitting in the window way too long he pizza was soggy and they never brought my nieces burger at all we ended up canceling her burger because she was hungry we gave her some of our food (she is only 7 didn't quite understand why she didn't get food).  It took 2 hours to get a cold pizza and finally get out of the damn restaurant. I will not go back to think location, I think the waitress is a reflection of the management which I am sure have no idea how to run a restaurant.

Mary A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/13/2017,"I eat at BJs frequently. Probably once a month or every couple of months. It has a large menu, usually not a long wait at this location, and it has better food than some competitors. This location in particular has always given me problems. Either the service is slow, they don't offer refills, etc. Not anything that I feel warrants a review. I am not a person who complains often. But what happened today is something that I feel people need to know. Today while we were eating lunch, my son was given his chicken tenders kids meal. This is something that he has eaten numerous times, and we have never had an issue. The worst that has happened is they have been lukewarm, presumably because they sit under a heat lamp while the other food is cooking. Again, not anything serious. I just had a baby, and I was distracted with tending to my baby. My husband cut up my son's chicken and he was not looking. My son took a bite of chicken and put it back down, and that's when I saw it. It was RAW. I mean, COMPLETELY raw. I freaked out and took all of the chicken off of his plate. I immediately got the waitress and she told the manager. The manager deflected responsibility, stating that the chicken comes precooked and it was an error with the supplier. And while that may or may not be true, I still do not understand how a chef can serve raw chicken, and to a child no less. Salmonella is no joke and it can be deadly for a toddler like my son. So you have to wonder, if the supplier gave them one raw piece of chicken, how many more are there? Why two stars and not one? The manager did try to remedy the situation. But I also felt like he didn't care that much. This is RAW poultry we are talking about. The kids meal was removed from my tab. But I feel like this is a mistake that is unforgivable. My son could get very sick, and now I need to play the waiting game. I wish that I had taken a picture, I am really angry at myself for not taking one. And yes, my husband should have paid more attention to my son's chicken. So should I. But when you eat at a restaurant, there are certain minimum expectations. Your food being cooked safely is one of them. Regardless of whether or not it was the supplier's fault, raw chicken should never have even come in contact with my son's plate. This is why I cannot in good faith ever return to BJs, and i cannot recommend it to anyone else. I wish that I didn't have to write this, but I feel that it is important for people to know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=60

We walked in and waited 15 minutes when they had 10+tables open!  We later were seated at small booth when we requested a bigger booth!  We waited 25 minutes for someone to take our order for drinks, then waited 10 minutes to get the drinks! After the waiter brought the drinks she did not take our order just walked away and came back 10 minutes! She said are you guys finally ready to order! That was so rude when we waited all this time! As we ordered I told them to bring out the food all at the same time and they just did what they wanted and brought it in 3 different times! The calimari was nasty its like they haven't changed there oil in over a year! The lemons on the side still had there tags! I ordered pita nachos and they brought out a flat bread pizza with a few macho ingredients!  The tortilla soup was over salted had no chips in it or avocado as shown in the picture! Never coming back the food and service is going down the drain! It looks like a mess I don't know why waiters are expecting tips these days!

Amy J.,"Sacramento, CA",523,204,1015,4.0,2/24/2016,"It always feels a little wonky doing a review for a popular chain. Everybody's kinda been there, done that. However, when a particular location does a few things very well, it seems worthy of pointing out.  Even though the BF and I are non-drinkers, we usually plant our butts on the barstools. We both love watching sports and one of the biggest advantages of dining at any BJ's are the multiple TVs. Another plus here is that you'll probably be waited on by Haans or Channing, easily two of the friendliest and most efficient bartenders I've ever met. They always greet new friends with a smile and never let a glass go empty for long. The quality of the food here has dramatically improved over the last year. A French dip that used to have tough, stringy meat is now tender and loaded with meat. They stepped up the au jus too, adding herbs and seasonings. Calamari is more consistent as well, arriving perfectly crisp on the outside, with soft squid inside. My inner sauce queen loves that they serve it with marinara and aioli for dipping. Two fairly recent additions to the menu that are worthy of an enthusiastic thumbs-up are the salmon quinoa bowl and the portobello Swiss burger. The salmon is an incredible value. For $12 at lunch you get a bed of seasoned quinoa topped with mushrooms, roasted red bell, sautéed red onion, asparagus, and a generous portion of glazed salmon. I'd been skeptical of ordering it, fearing it would be bland. Not so, it was very tasty and less than 795 calories as a bonus. The portobello burger was unexpectedly gourmet. The large slice of umami bombed mushroom on top of the burger was of course a treat, but I didn't realize they were also throwing in arugula, caramelized onions, pesto, and a balsamic vinaigrette. The combination of flavors was incredibly delicious. Highly recommend adding bacon to really take it over the moon. However, the $2 extra for bacon takes it out of value range creating a whopping $15 burger. Worth it occasionally, but probably won't be on the regular rotation.  The rewards program is one of the best in corporate America. You earn a point for every dollar spent. Several different rewards are available, but the one I like to shoot for is earning $25 off your meal after 350 points. Not so hard to do if you darken their doorway about twice a month.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=60

After 15 minutes, we weren't greeted by a server, no drink order taken. I had to get up and ask someone for service. When i asked if we could have service, a waitress (didn't catch her name but she had dark hair and tattoos on her arms), seemed annoyed that I was even talking to her and told me we would be helped shortly. It took so long that our drink and food order was taken at the same time. Our WATER showed up 10 minutes later and the sparkling water showed up 20 minutes later. Once our food arrived, our server, Trenton never paid any attention to us. We had to ask another server for water refills. We ordered 3 Pizookies for the table and when we got our bill, we were charged full price. Pi day fell on a Tuesday, so Pizookies were already on special for $3 every Tuesday. Trenton told us the special is ""tomorrow."" We had to show him the email with the promo and even the menu said so... Then he took another 15 minutes to bring our bill back.

We were very disappointed when I ordered the ""6 oz"" steak. When it arrived it was smaller than the palm of my hand and only about a 1/2 inch thick. My wife first commented on it because Weight Watchers says a steak the size of your palm is a 3 oz steak.  We pointed this out to our waitress who tried to justify it by saying, ""that is before cooked"".  Really?  There is 50% shrinkage!? The manager finally came over and was going to justify the size by saying how thick it was. I showed that it was actually very thin. When we received our bill she had comped the steak. Which is the only reason I went back to BJ's. This time to a different location.  I went with a group from work and ordered the lunch portion salmon. While the oz's were not listed, when my plate arrived the whole table laughed at my sliver of salmon. It was hardly larger than a club cracker!! It was wedge shaped, less than 1/2 inch on the ""fat"" end and within an inch tapered to only about a 1/16 of and inch.  This sliver of salmon couldn't have been more than 1 1/2 oz's.  I didn't complain, I didn't send it back. I won't beg a restaurant to serve me a respectable sized serving for the money I paid them.

The portions of food were large and the appearance of the food was great. After that everything started going down hill and the last time I came here was an eye opener. The service has gotten much slower and the time we spend waiting has gone up as well. I mean really it shouldn't take 20 minutes to get a refill on a soda. On top of that the portions have gotten smaller. I remember how big the portions used to be when it came to burgers and fries and now the portions make me feel like I'm eating off kids menu. Last time I ordered a burger I specified cheese to be put on my burger and it never made it on the patty. On top of that, it looked like the burger was put together with a blindfold. The fries...well the portions on them has gone down as well and you're still hungry after you finish your plate.The service is also poor. It's painfully slow and at times insulting. I asked for a refill on a soda and the waiter acknowledged my request but he came back to my table later empty handed. I told him again and after 10 minutes I had to flag him down to ask about my drink.

I'll start with the positive first. The root beer rib appetizer was very good. My kids ordered from the kids menu which they enjoyed. I ordered the bacon cheese burger medium. It came well done and the patty was very dry. The menu stated the burgers come ""loaded."" All mine had was one iceberg lettuce leaf. I had to ask for pickles and I used the cole slaw from the rib platter on my burger. Tomato, onion, and pickles would have been nice with out having to ask for it.  And it came out luke warm.

Sven R.,"Sacramento, CA",191,122,117,3.0,7/5/2017,"I've enjoyed BJ's for a long time. The beer is first rate and there's always a new seasonal offering to try frequently. From San Jose to Elk Grove to this location in Sacramento near Arco Arena (sorry, I'm old school,) the dinning experience is pretty consistent. What does vary is the service and this visit here afforded us a wonderful waitress that was fast and genuinely concerned about our needs. This isn't always the case at BJ's.  I ordered the Prime Rib French Dip. It was a healthy portion of pink meat that had a good flavor to it. This was a French Dip and thus it required dipping, right?  Into the Au Jus it went but not before I smothered the bread with all the white ""horseradish"" sauce. I love real horseradish for its flavor and spice. This had very little of either. Still, the sandwich was enjoyable. Even more enjoyable was the sweet potato fries which were few in number. Truthfully, I didn't mind since I was not in need of more calories.  Ya, BJ's is a nice place to get a really good beer and some good food along with the brew. I don't understand the draw to wait as long as 45 minutes...let alone half that, but I guess others like it more than I do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=40

Seemed like a great start, about 30 min later the waiter finally walked by and we had to ask her how long our food would be. She advised us 2/3 are ready and the third almost. After bringing 2 meals out another 30 min later still no third plate. We ordered a 4th dish and it came out within 10 minutes and still no 3rd dish. What really set it off is the waiter had the nerve to say that there is a large group they are catering to which is unacceptable. Your suppose to cater to first come basis not based on group size.

I also ordered the Cookies N Creme pizookie which is my go to pizookie but honestly the trip is really good as well. I saw later on in the night they had a churro pizookie. From the looks of it I will definitely try that out so anyone thinking about goin anytime soon it's seasonal.  I also got the BBQ chicken pizza .

She commands my girlfriend to remove her reading glasses and look up at her and not in a friendly way. Ok we move on we ordered the pulled pork slider and a salad. The pulled pork was cold. We didn't bother sending it back because the waitress was already moody. We ask for the check to pay. In this time we get a substitute waiter I pay with a 100 dollar bill and typically you should receive your receipt with your change he purposely or not only brings back the cash change and leaves. I ask him for the receipt and before I even bring it up he says ""oh I'm sorry if it's short I just got change from the front"" he waited as I counted knowing darn well he had shorted me a few dollars. He tries and apologize and now it makes sense why he didn't bring my receipt. I got and speak to the front and he not only lied about getting change from the front but also stole from us. He brought back the right amount of change and we spoke to the manager and all she could say was thank you for letting me know so I can coach him. He's probably done it before and gotten away with it even if it's a few dollars it's still stealing and the fact that the manager didn't seem concern at all makes me even question the business practices of this establishment.

It is what it is... awful.   I didn't have time to send it back but it would have been nice if he voluntarily took it off the bill but he did not.  I paid $12 for about 6 bites.  I am not on a diet but I try to make good choices and if I am going to eat something highly caloric, then it better be worth an hour in the gym.  This was not worth it so didn't want to take it home either.

When you say your gonna bring something, then bring it. Don't carry on a conversation with your coworkers about you weekends plans and forget your at work. Second listen to your patrons. When we have to repeat an order several times and your right next to the person, maybe you should get a hearing aid or maybe clean you ears.

Jean S.,"Sacramento, CA",203,244,1452,4.0,6/11/2015,"Out of all the BJ's locations I've been to, this one is my favorite! I've dined at this location over 50 times so I've had a wide range of experiences, but majority of them have been above average to excellent. One thing that stands out about this location is the customer service. I've come across some of the best waiters/waitresses in the dining industry here in this unsuspecting little BJ's. In the recent months, there were a couple of male waiters in the bar area and at least one female waitress in the restaurant area that were amazing! Genuinely friendly, excited, positive, and helpful! Definitely top notch customer service. There were a few times that I had waitresses that were not quite as excellent/genuine and some rather cold, but I can't let that take away from those that did provide excellent service.  A few other instances when I thought service was great - one time I came when their credit card machine was broken. The place was packed and the workers looked frantic as I overheard several of them saying they never used the manual credit card reader. I decided to order takeout instead of dining in. During all this chaos, the lady taking my order was still very positive, patient, and kept a friendly smile. She offered me a free beverage during my wait and was kind and helpful the entire time. The food came out a lot faster than I expected as well. Another time, the manager Jeremy had quickly addressed my issue when I felt something didn't taste right. He offered to take the dish off the bill or replace it (although I just kept it as it wasn't that bad). Also, being a loyalty member, I usually receive emails for a survey regarding my experience. Whether positive or negative, the general manager Shawn always responds and addresses concerns if there are any. One other note - the hostesses are USUALLY pretty good about greeting people when they come in or thanking them when they leave (although this was not done last night when I came and left). But out of 50+ times, the percentage of above average customer service is in the greater.  So onto the food. Not everything on this menu is 5 star and sometimes my favorite dishes come out better than other times. One of my must orders is the avocado egg rolls. Last night, it was one of the best ever! Crispy on the outside with perfect and generous amounts of avocado dipped in that sweet tamarind sauce...super delicious! I also tried the honey sriracha brussel sprouts and they were fantastic. They do have a tiny spicy kick. One of my favorite pizzas is their BJ's Favorite. Sometimes it's really good, but yesterday's was just ok. There was a lot of dough and the toppings were not spread out very well so some slices were practically naked. And the bell pepper toppings were not cooked very well. So not the best this time. I've ordered this dish several times in the past and it came out very tasty. Another great appetizer is their chicken wings with buffalo and ranch sauce. The chicken wings are usually moist and juicy and not over dry.  They do offer a kids menu. For $5.75, the chicken tenders, side of fries, and a cup of milk is not too bad. All kids meals include an entree, side, and drink for $5.75.  Of course, I can't forget the pizookie! Nothing beats the Cookies N' Cream pizookie, but all the flavors are really good! Some may say the pizookie is too sweet (and it probably is for one person), but it definitely should be shared! They have mini sizes now and even those can be shared. If  you are celebrating a birthday, they offer a free mini pizookie. Nice! BJ's is definitely one of the best chain restaurants amongst its kind. At this location especially, the food is usually pretty good, but the service is great. Also a great place for beers and game watching.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=120
Jeremy H.,"Sacramento, CA",89,125,54,3.0,7/28/2016,"Pretty good. Not amazing, but good. I enjoyed most everything I've ordered... been to this one and a few others probably a half dozen times total. The beers are pretty good, the cocktails are a little hit and miss, and the menu is a mixed bag. What I mean by that is they really try to tackle a large variety of dishes and continually add new things to the menu to see how customers like them. I've tried some of the experimental dishes and that's what they tasted like... experiments. Typically I'd like the first few bites and then I'd realize that it was overall waaaaay to salty or sugary. For price and portions though I still thought everything is pretty fair here and I'll likely come back here and there. I saw some complaints on service here, but I've always had great service here. They would accommodate to any seating requests I had, which is important if you bring kids, and our waiters/waitresses have always responded to us quick and kept our drinks filled. Knowing Natomas though, you'll definitely want to be careful about showing up during peak hours or you'll be waiting... that's how it is for most large restaurants in that area though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=120

Bruno W.,"Woodland, CA",5,1,,1.0,9/27/2016,"Worst customer service with the same waiter twice.  I'm a regular customer at this location. I always come and order the same dish, chicken Alfredo. And the waiters are always willing to replace my broccoli with chicken since I dont like brocolli, for no extra charge. Even the first time I asked my regular waiters to take out the brocolli they offered me more chicken with no hesitation. I didn't even asked for it. So I always ask for no brocolli and they give me the extra chicken with no fee. Until having the worst experience ever on August when this waiter decided to have a lot of attitude with me even before ordering my food. When I ordered my usual dish he right away cut my words saying in such a very rude way there is an extra charge for replacing brocolli for chicken. I didn't like the way he approached to me so I decided to talk to the manager and that manager told me ""This guy is a good worker"" and this manager told me that yes there is an extra charge for replacing brocolli but hes going to do it that time for free. The manager just excused that waiter and I didn't even got an apologize for that attitude, instead the manager sent me the same waiter to attend me. I ate, pay and left the restaurant with a bad experience but I didn't want to post this on yelp, so I didn't.  After that I came back and my waiters treated me, as always, with respect and I replaced my brocolli for chicken with no question.  Until tonight, I had the unfortunate of having the same crummy waiter with a lot of attitude and he even recognized me. I ordered my regular dish chicken alfredo and asked him to replace brocolli for chicken. He answered right away and with a sarcastic smile ""dont you remember what my manager told you that we charge extra for the chicken"" arent waiters supposed to be courteous to the customers? Because he sure wasn't. His attitude was worst than the first time so I had to get up and left the restaurant. Im not planning to ever come back again even though this was my favorite restaurant.  I understand that there could be extra charges but there is always courtesy from waiters and that is the hook that makes a customer come back to the restaurant and that is the reason why I was a regular customer and used to come during my lunch break. In fact, i think courtesy to customers is more important that profiting $1 to replace brocolli. To me it shows that the business is weak and cares nothing about its customers. I never experienced this in other locations like Elk Grove or Arden. They are always courteous to the customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=120

What we received was a chicken sandwich that looked like something you could get at an AMPM gas station and the special chicken sandwich that straight up tasted like fryer oil.  Not wanting to cause a scene like some people can, we promptly got his attention and told him about our problem. The manager,  who besides the Pazookie is the only redeeming quality of this establishment, apologized and brought us out replacement meals.  I did not get her name but she had a chef coat on and a long braid. Her professionalism was top notch. I am grateful she was there to defuse the situation and offer a solution. She is a gem.

So after all 15 were seated, it took a -long- time for someone to get our order. We had a reservation. I don't get it. Its not like we just showed up? Anyway the food was decent. I had a salad. Bathrooms were clean but a little dark for my taste. The service overall was not very good. We had a huge pile of dirty dishes that nobody came to collect. We actually had to pick up our own dishes and put them on another empty table waiting to be serviced! Its difficult to enjoy coffee & desert with no room to move! Mercifully, the end & time to figure out the bill. Oy vay again!!! There were other meals included on our bill and  others who had entirely wrong meals on theirs! The waitress asked us to look over our bill to see what was incorrect and she came back with a corrected bill. Really. Disappointing experience!!!

Dan R.,"Woodland, CA",3,7,,4.0,3/23/2016,"We go to BJ's often.  They consider us regulars and we often get what we perceive as special treatment.  Your experience may vary. The food is usually good, though 10-20% you will get a favorite dish that is a bit off.  It is clearly related to how busy they are at the time.  Local concerts, graduations and very large parties stretch the place to near capacity and food and service can suffer. If there are issues with food, the management is quite ready to make it right in some way. Good food: Brussel sprouts appetizer, most of the ""enlightened"" (healthy) menu, pizza. Drinks: The beer is better than average, though it may disappoint beer snobs (like me) a bit.  It is brewed by the company, but not on premises.  Hop Storm and Jeremiah Red are not bad.  My wife has enjoyed the lemon drop and pina colada at various times.  Call ahead seating works pretty well to reduce wait times.  About half the time the greeters who answer the phone recognize my wife's voice and accurately put us on the list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=220

I ordered the same dish as last time and was really disappointed. The noodles were mixed with sun dried tomatoes and steame broccoli. There was absolutely no flavor so I asked the waiter and they explained that the menu item recipes have changed.

Last night I stopped in for dinner and the Niner game with 9 other friends. Service was attentive, our waitress checked on us so many times when we weren't ready we decided to let her know we'd flag her down when we decided. The restaurant wasn't super packed but got busier as the night progressed and the Niners vs Bears game was on. My boyfriend and I shared the new Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza and nachos. The pizza was really good the nachos were okay. I enjoyed the flavors and amount of toppings on the pizza. It seemed liked there could have been more toppings on the nachos for the amount of chips. Also the waitress actually forgot to put our nacho order in but they came out pretty soon after we reminded her. Actually for a party of 10 all the food came out pretty quick. As always I enjoyed my Berry Burst Cider and look forward to trying the Irish Root Beer (my friend ordered) next time. I would say BJ's is the best chain restaurant in Natomas.

So this time after losing 5 unsuccessful tries to place an order on the phone and 10 minutes on hold to get disconnected it was time to go in and place an order at the to go counter. I'm that determined to get dinner.  When I arrive I grab a menu to confirm the name of the items I was going to order. I was told that it would be a minute after an order was given out. I agreed knowing it would buy me some time to glance at other items like dessert.  The 2nd order was given out to other take our customers. One minute after the 3rd order was called for other customers. I understand, I work in customer service too. I know the importance of getting customers out. I also know the importance of getting orders into the kitchen be able to reduce wait time. We have all been there, hurry up and get the order in to wait less.  When the 4th order is called and I haven't been asked what I want to order I pay more attention. It's been 6 minutes and still no time for me. I'm still looking at the TVs at the bar holding a menu. There is a young man that walked in that's greeted immediately, asked if he's picking up, after he confirms his name the girl leaves to go check out back.  5 minutes later she returns with his food and still no time for me to place my order. I'm now wondering if I missed something.  I guess waiting 11 minutes to place a take out order is normal now! I yelp the hours for chipotle. After all we pay more and leave a tip at bjs and not chipotle.  I didn't want to stick around now and place an order, wait for my food and get home to eat. I would've been eating at 11pm.  Chipotle closes at 10pm and when I walked in at 957pm the greeted me with a smile. Sadly I've been leaving nothing for a tip at chipotle.      Time to re-evaluate my loyalty towards bjs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=220

Alex T.,"Sacramento, CA",1314,1006,6490,4.0,5/1/2015,i had a great experience coming to this location. i had came here with my family after the barry manilow concert. we were sat down quick. then we were asked what we like to drink. we had plenty of time looking at the menu and deciding what we want. we were pretty quick about it since we hungry after the concert from resisting on the popcorn and nachos and you know the arm and leg kind of junk food snacks. anyways it was late at night maybe around 11pm and it was still packed. it happened to be on a week night and i thought maybe they had happy hour after 9 but maybe it was over and they said no not for tonight i said ok.  anyways we ordered a small sized pizza i believe it was the great white shark pizza. next we ordered their new dish of fajita nachos with beef i believe. the cajun chicken pasta with fettecune noodles. also one kids meal with chicken nuggets and fries.  the food wait wasn't long til we got the food. the nachos came out first and we were disappointed how the cheese stuck together and wasn't the regular cheesy dip. i knew the price we paid of course they used the real cheese to melt it but it was stuck in a whole bunch. next the pizza came out and we each had a pieces and they were big slices and were deep dish which was awesome with some ranch dip. next we had the pasta and omg this was the most amazing dish in our table. the pasta noodles were on point for the texture and mainly the taste to the sauce was good and chicken was well seasoned and char grilled too. it also came with 2 garlic bread sticks and they were so crunchy and tasty too. the kids meal was just plain chicken nuggets with fries and nothing to special with that since it was for a kid.  the service was great and attentive and came and check up on us. the server has to come back multiple times refilling the water since we were all dehydrated form all the dancing beforehand. i did have some craving for their alcohol drinks such as the strawberry splash but i was with family and i was the driver so of course i had to refrain myself from getting something with alcohol. i think the only thing missing with my meal was a ice cold beer or the strawberry splash haha. anyways hope this review help in sort of a way and had you imagined being their with me dining hehe. have a great day and thanks for reading.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=220

Must be nice... 10/31/15 approx 3pm we (three of us) came to BJ's for some good eats. The restaurant was not busy and had quite a few open tables. We were greeted and seated right away. As we perused through our menus I saw the waiter attend the two tables next to us. He did this a few times. Not once did he acknowledge us. Only after four more guests arrived and were attended within a minute of being seated did I get upset.  I went up to the hostess and asked her if we were going to be attended. She grabbed the manager. He urged us to stay. My table decided to try our luck elsewhere.  Honestly, it felts as if we weren't welcomed. You see... the majority of the other guest were caucasian and so were the servers. The party of four who were attended to right away were also caucasian. It seems like BJ's provides slow service selectively and since this is a reportedly frequent occurrence it has to be coming from management. Natomas is one of the most divers neighborhoods in all of the US. Is this why BJ's in Natomas has so many poor service reviews? It might be something worth looking into. Perhaps BJ's should also look into their hiring policies. All the wait staff was Caucasian, hardly representative of the neighboring population. It's hard to believe that only Caucasians would have applied to be wait staff.

They seat us in one of those round booths and we obviously have the carseat - carrier thing for our little infant dude, they tried to give us a 'sling' to leave him out in the walkway and basically on top of the table next to us.  We ended up having to wedge him in the booth with us.   I ordered the chicken with rice and vegetables for my toddler and the pepperoni pizza for the big kiddo, the lil' guy didn't get a kids meal from the menu heh.  So, their meals come, and the pizza is cheese, so we're like oh this is supposed to be pepperoni, the waiter in training says oh sorry we'll fix that up for you.  Then, I see it.  These disgusting vegetables they're trying to pass off on us.  See picture... The carrots are like dried up and old...  It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen, they look like they were found in a dumpster after a week of rotting or something.  I want to vomit thinking about it.  I ended up having to give her my fries because the waiter had disappeared with the cheese pizza and we couldn't even flag anyone down. The pizza retuns... it's literally the same cheese pizza with like 5 pieces of semi warm pepperoni on it now.  Like they put pepperoni on it and then put it in the microwave.   It was incredibly sad, then it got sadder.  No drink refills until they swoop by with the check, no checking on us to see how things were, no boxes offered, nothing like that.

After bring sat in the same place as the day before(Yes I came two days in a row) we saw our same waiter and were pretty happy. He was on top of it Halloween night and super nice!! This is where the service changed for the worst. I believe a lady by the name of Renee walked up to our table. A little ditzy ""hope you are all having a good Sunday"" we looked at her and informed her it was Saturday. We asked for silverware. We had already been waiting a while so we gave her our drink, appetizer and food order all at once. We should of asked for a different waiter at this point as she stumbled through the order. Drinks and appetizers were refilled and brought to table by many different staff after this. Stuffed mushrooms and pot stickers were only warm when brought to the table. Sent back potstickers to get the same luke warm ones back again. When food came the pastas were great, hamburger was great, but as always  one of our guests requests for a dry pastrami wasn't dry (this is not the first or second time this has happened at this exact BJS but multiple) as usual the same manager comes out in his blue shirt I think his name was Jeremy (surprised he didn't recognize us) said he's sorry for the inconvenience and comped the pot stickers and pastrami and a new one would be out quickly. The second one arrived and from the seat I was sitting in could smell burnt bread I myself reach over and flipped the bun and the inside of the bun was toasted beyond burnt. The person eating this was super disappointed sitting 20+ minutes watching everyone else eat just decided to eat the burnt sandwich. I was obviously mad at this point being that I asked to come here two days in a row. So I stopped Renee our waiter to ask why the bun was burnt (I even had her smell the burnt bun) she informed our table that this is how it's made and if she was eating this sandwich this is just how she would like it prepared. I double asked her ""so really you would expect a burnt sandwich and she said yes. We told her NOT TO COME BACK TO OUR TABLE.

Not to mention, their menu is unbearably long....what don't they serve??  But seriously, get the avocado egg rolls.

Our waitress Stephanie continued to mess up our orders and could not get our simple check right. She spent half an hour shuffling about trying to figure out who's check she had given us and where our check went. She then proceeded to take my credit card from me and walk around the entire restaurant with it trying to figure out what to do. She profusely apologized but made no effort to accommodate us in anyway by giving us any type of discount or letting us speak with a manager when asked. When we finally got our check, we realize that she had double charged us for many things. She then proceed to spend another half hour trying to figure out how to get those charges off. Finally, she was not able to use my rewards card because ""the computer was down"". I'm a big fan of BJ's brewhouse but I will not be coming back here again and I will make sure that anyone I know hears about it.

There was chicken and guacamole and other ingredients on the plate, but no liquid.  That's when she brought out soup and POURED it on my plate, burning me in the process.  She didn't even apologize, just poured and left.  My finger started turning a nice shade of red and started trembling.  My coworker asked the other server for ice, and she went,""What for?"". I showed her my finger and she said in a snotty voice,""Aww, do you needs band aid too?""   SCUSE ME *ITCH?!  Of course I didn't do that, but I did roll my eyes and ask for ice again.

No open tables in the front room so we had to wait for 10 minutes for a table to open up. There was a few games on TV though.  The staff is very friendly and overall the service was good. The hostess seated us when our table was ready and soon after our waitress took our order for drinks and dinner. We got the calamari first and it was great, the chef cooked it perfectly, it was crispy.  We ordered a turkey club and a classic burger. The thin cut fries came out cold, but we didn't want to complain. (-1star) Just hungry, the rest of the food was hot though. The turkey club was good, but I didn't know that BJs grill the sourdough with butter, so it was a little hard and the taste was a little off.

Also the wedge fries were really good and we got a lot of them. The turkey sandwich was eaten but you could have gotten that anywhere.  I got the pizza and was not happy.  The crust tasted funny the cheese wasn't melted under the pepperoni.  I wish I hadn't gotten the pizza and if I ever come back I'll get something else.  Another good reason for the big menu.  Our table also got 2 white Russians and she said those were good.  For dessert we got the salted carmel which was good and between 4 people was perfect.  Overall not a great first experience so I dunno if I'd come back but if my group did then I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=300

The chips that came as an appetizer were seriously stale. I've had an open bag of chips from home that weren't as stale as these were.  Moving on...here comes the pizza we ordered. Man, it was made fast! I was stoked about that because I was starving. Unfortunately, it was prepared entirely too quickly.

We ordered the ahi tuna appetizer with our drinks, and not only did our drinks take quite a while, when we finally received our appetizer it tasted nothing like any other ahi dish we have had at any other bjs. We had to tell another waiter about our dissatisfaction because for most of the night our waiter was no where to be found. And then when we complained he started avoiding us. After about 15 minutes with no new appetizer we asked our waiter when he finally came around, (which once again he was not checking on us or even refilling our drinks for the matter) to speak with the manager.  When the manager came over we explained all our issues and he was very apologetic, and said he was going to personally check on our orders and even asked my friend if he wanted another beer. And that was the last we saw of the manager. When we FINALLY received out appetizer and dishes, (which the appetizer was better,not even great and my own dish lukewarm) the manager not once came back and asked how we were and how any of our food. That to me speaks very loudly poor manager skills, poor customer skills, and just poor manners in general. And then when we get the bill the beer the manager offered my friend was added into the bill on top of the appetizer that wasn't that great. It isn't about the money, or even taking anything off.  If the manager at least came over, or if the server offered better service would have changed the tone of our meal, but after being a server for 4 years I can easily say I will not ever be coming back to this bjs and it really has made me reevaluate going back to any bjs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=300

Alycea M.,"Sacramento, CA",142,21,15,4.0,1/6/2016,"I went into BJ's for the first time last week and really enjoyed it. When I imagined BJ's I figured it would look more like a sports bar and not as classy as it looks which made me enjoy it even more haha. I feel bad because I don't exactly remember our servers name (sorry, but if it helps I think it was Vanessa or Valerie). We came in around 5 right before the real busy hours on a Saturday night and immediately got sat which was great. Our food came out amazing minus my boyfriends cabbage which was over cooked. My only note would be for the cooks to check how they put the meat on the stove top. On both of our pieces of meat they were cooked differently on the left and right.

Cynthia K.,"Sacramento, CA",3,3,1,5.0,1/15/2014,"I still need to go to this particular BJ's, sorry, however we used to go to the one at the Arden Fair Mall.  The food was absolutely fabulous, and so was the service from the hostesses, and the waiters - whether it was the cocktail server, the actual waiter/waitresses, or anyone walking past us!  I especially enjoyed their special pizza that had spinach and garlic on it. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of it but would if I looked at the menu again so if needed, feel free to send me  question.   The wine and drinks were terrific too, but the pizza was awesome!   The ambiance is very nice however it can be very loud with so many customers.  The music is always nice and matches with the general age group and quality clientele - no rap crap, hard rock, acid, in other words noise (not music) - therefore the music was complimentary to the entire experience. DRESS - Casual or dressy is acceptable.  You will even feel comfortable if you are dressed up for a special occasion you might me attending later, such as a rodeo or masquerade party, as long as you look nice, without nudity, or extreme cleavage showing for example, since this is a ""family"" place. They used a beeper system for the waiting and had comfortable places to sit inside and outside (smokers).   The wait always seemed to go by quickly, apx. time was 10-20 minutes without reservations.  Plenty of parking but in a mall/shopping area so sometimes (depending upon the day and time) finding a space could take quite a few minutes, without using the mall valet service (which is free, but you should certainly tip them), and the HANDICAPPED parking was even more limited due to not having their own parking lot.

I guess it's kind of strange that I come to a chain restaurant for clam chowder, but it's seriously way better than a lot of other places (and I've tried a lot, even award winning ones in the Sac area that don't really live up to their hype). There are large chunks of clam - yum! I hate it when restaurants serve clam chowder, and there are practically no clam pieces. This is not the case here - their clam chowder is so freaking good (as long as it comes out hot). Most of their appetizers are tasty. I like the thai lettuce wraps with shrimp.

The food was cold and look like it had been sitting a while.  Five minutes later the remaining half of our dishes arrived. My sandwich was missing some ingredients.

There's a way to serve people and suggest things but, it was so annoying that even her face started to bother me. It made for an unenjoyable lunch and consequently.. this review. For the most part, BJ's has an extensive menu with key novelty things like their HUGE baked potatoes, their pizookies.. I think it's pretty decent food but it's nothing I'll crave for or seek. I'll never be the one to say-- Let's eat at BJ's! If it's there, it's there. And that's my feelings on that. It is what it is.

Not a problem, he can have some pizza while we wait.  Umm, not really. The pizza's dough was raw.

The problem I had is while we were waiting i ordered drinks and not only did the bartender short the liqour, he let it sit on ice for 3 minutes while he made other drinks and then gave it to me watered down with the appearance of a full glass lol. You never know a person's situation (he could be new, could be his first rush, could have simply forgotten) so I still tipped him $10 and this kills me, he looks up and says, ""i'll hook you up next time man"" as if he new he shorted me....

David S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,139,,4.0,3/11/2014,"Like a lot of chain restaurants, I think BJ's gets a bad rap from a lot Yelp reviewers.  Regardless of the experience they have, many folks never give a chain restaurant a good review...in fact, I think a lot of people actually lie through their teeth on some of the stuff that I see on here. BJ's Natomas does a nice job.  Their service is always cheerful and friendly, they have a wide selection of food that is prepared well, and a really good selection of quality beer.  One tip I will give for beer lovers...ask the bartender if they have any special reserve beers that they don't advertise or make part of their regular rotation.  I've had a really good Belgian Abbey Ale and some nice seasonal IPA's just by asking for something different. I like BJ's, and their success as a semi-upscale casual dining choice is evidence that they are doing things right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=280

The quality and serving size is great. But, if you go with a crowd say 6 or more the service really drops. Even worse, if you go during peak hours in the weekend you will almost for sure get bad service. It seems that they don't pride theirselves in service quality, oh food quality. I think the price here is a tad buy more expensive than average and the locations are nice. So you would think they would have descent servers. So food is great service is bad.

Yesterday I had the bacon cheeseburger and fries, The fries were good but the burger was disgusting there was a flavor on my burger that honestly was horrible. Idk if it was the ""burger sauce"", the bacon or the actual burger patty. Needless to say i didn't finish it and i did not take my leftovers home. My sister even said that her pizza ,which she has always ordered the same one, tasted weird and different. We had ordered an appetizer when we were ordering our drink and it was the spinach and artichoke dip and it tasted amazing but the one thing has has always bugged me and they've done this every time, is they always serve it with broken chips like bottom of the bag looking chips. The saddest part is my sister even said they their water tasted nasty and she asked for more lemons to cover up the taste of the water. Like I'm sorry that's just horrible. I'd give it 1 star but the Customer Service was pretty good.

Jeff K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,12,1,1.0,10/20/2013,"I have been a customer of BJ's restaurant for a long time, just like anyone else. The level of service I had received in the past was definitely up to par - until coming to this particular BJ's.  It was my friends 26th birthday. We stopped by late (around 11) for her free pazooki and a drink, to unwind from sushi. Unfortunately her license expired on her actual birthday, but for legal purposes, she brought her paper license  from the DMV.  When our group had finished ordering our drinks, we were routinely asked for our IDs by our nice waitress. When noticing the birthday girl was carrying an expired ID, my friend quickly pulled out the DMV paper license. Our waitress had kindly asked that she double check with her manager to see if it was allowed.  We then were rudely informed by the GM that they could not serve the birthday pazooki, as well as her alcoholic beverage. Our group had quickly replied to his remark, explaining that the DMV had assured her that the paper was still a valid ID - for drinks, as well as driving - but he increasingly began to lose his patience with us. He was not accommodating to such a special occasion, and additionally continued to condescendingly state that he had every right to refuse service, when our group was more than understanding and kind about the matter, even though we were all well over 21 years old.  I am not rating  poorly because of some bias against the franchise, but because of the horrible management, and the quality of how we were treated by this manager. I still wonder if it was just a horrible day for the GM in particular, or if he viewed us negatively because we are college students.  I believe that he is still accountable for his poor decision to flaunt such a negative attitude towards paying customers. I have already contacted headquarters to further fix this issue, so that nobody has to deal with such poor managerial service.     I would definitely not recommend this particular BJ's to anyone I know in the Sacramento/Davis area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=280

Trish L.,"Sacramento, CA",111,8,5,1.0,10/24/2016,"I use to love going to Bjs, but after my experience last night I will not be going back. The menu was changed and they took off my favorite meal, the balsamic chicken. So I had to find something new which wasn't a problem. The waiter started out at the table by complaining about a party of 16 and his night. We were out for an anniversary dinner so the complaining was not the best way to start out the night. I ordered a steak and asked to get the mashed potatoes without cheese. The waiter said that was not possible which now leads me to know the food is just pre-made frozen and warmed up. When I told him I would find something different on the menu the waiter went back and forth with me 3-4 times pushing me to get the steak which ended in a slight argument. I kept telling him I would find something different. He was confused as to why I did not want the steak with the potato. In my opinion when I stated I would pick something else the issue should have been dropped. From that point on it was a waiting game for the food. My burger wasn't great, they no longer have shoe string fries, and our pizza was cold. When we got our appetizer, 15 minutes after getting one salad for the table, there was not any lemon for the calamari. I tried to get someone's attention but of coarse I was ignored since we were not directly their table. Never going back. Sad because pizookies are awesome.

Miranda b.,"Sacramento, CA",0,13,,4.0,10/23/2011,"Our party of 8 was seated quickly (although the floors are incredibly slippery!) It's a nice, large place - our big round corner booth was a nice spot although I would avoid it if you'd like to have a conversation across the table. The menu is long and the prices are okay - a medium deep dish pizza is $18 and feeds 2-3 (with appetizers), appetizers run around $3 or $8 for 'shareable' appetizer plates. I've heard great things about their pizza, but mine was disappointing. It was very, very soggy. It had clearly been sitting there for a while. Everyone else in my group was very satisfied with their food (the stuffed potatoes are delicious!). The spinach stuffed mushrooms appetizer (6 mushrooms for $3.50) were probably the most delicious thing I've had at a restaurant in a long time! The salads are filling and they don't skimp on ingredients- all fresh with great dressings. There are many vegetarian options - more than I've seen at most restaurants - and most of them are delicious enough to satisfy meat eaters. Desserts were perfect - the baked beignet, the pizookies, the apple berry crumble pie. Desserts were a great end to our meal. Our waiter was very quick- and attentive without being annoying. She was refilling drinks before we even noticed they were empty!

The soup here is actually I think the high point.  The chili is good though quite mild but the other soups are tasty and the bread bowls they can be served in are excellent.  The Large jacket potatoes are also quite good though i am often left with a lot of unadorned spud which is a problem for me.  The Cajun pasta here is a let down, the sauce is this sort of bruschetta topping stuff that is chunky and doesn't cling to the noodles and the chicken is blackened but the spice mix is pretty sweet for my taste. The Pizookie here is their big desert draw and while my girlfriend is in love with their super chocolate version it was too rich for my blood.  The other versions are like a soft baked cookie in a deep dish pizza pan with a scoop of ice cream.  Nothing terribly inventive but there is a reason everyone serves cookie sundaes, they are delicious. The food here is always pretty good, the service is sometimes good but never great and gets horrible when they are busy.  Nothing here is to die for but everything seems to be quality (though sometimes misconceived as with the cajun pasta).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=460

I recently ordered their spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce, which featured a ""hint"" of alfredo. Sounded like a good time to me! But the end result was surprisingly bland. Now I'm not one of those people that loves ultra spicy food, but there really wasn't any heat to it at all. And while I am a big alfredo fan, the ""hint"" (which was more like 50/50) really mellowed out the marinara flavor until there wasn't much to it. I ate it all, but it could have been so much more. On top of that, the waitress forgot my house salad, and once I got it, I came to the same conclusion that I later would with the pasta: good but not great.  Other items have fared better in the past, like their thick crust pizza, and there's so much variety in their menu that it is hard to rate their entire restaurant on one meal. Still, this visit only gets them 3 stars... although I will be back again.

Missus T.,"Davis, CA",0,72,1,2.0,8/19/2013,"You know how restaurants ask you to tell them about a problem before you Yelp? That doesn't work if they don't respond! We had a disappointing dinner here recently, and I took the General Manager's Card so I could email him. Alas, a full week later, not a word. So, Mr. Sandoval, here you go! We arrived a little before 5 pm, and handed the hostess our Rewards Card. The restaurant was less than half full, with one large party seated in the middle dining section. We were taken to the first two-top in that section, arguably the worst table in the house at anytime since every patron and server must squeeze by it, but made worse by being next to an 18 person party. I asked if we could have a different table, and was immediately seated in one of the raised curved booths, (from which I watched two other couples in the course of our meal refuse that table.) I was, truthfully, a little put out by this - there's no good reason to seat people at a poor table when the restaurant is not busy. It took slightly longer than usual for the waiter to take our drink order since he was also serving the large party, but he was very nice. Once our drinks arrived, we each ordered an appetizer and a main course, and the waiter said he would have the apps out right away.  After about 20 minutes, we saw waiter bringing our appetizers. That's slightly longer than we usually wait for our food at Bj's, but we figured it was the large party and were being patient. A runner right behind our waiter was carrying two more plates, which turned out to be our sandwiches. Waiter said ""oh, the apps took longer than expected and everything came out at once, can I get you anything else?""  We were dumbfounded but hungry, so we accepted our food. I'm sure I was not very gracious, however. I alternated bites of app and dinner so I got at least part of my food hot, but it was awkward and felt rushed.  While I recognize that BJ's is casual dining, I don't think that anyone expects to have all their courses served at once. I don't know if the order was put in incorrectly or if the kitchen made a mistake, and, as the customer, I don't really care - either the kitchen or our server should have caught the mistake and ensured that it was corrected.  Since this was a birthday dinner for us, we would probably have ordered a second drink after the app and had dessert.

I got the sample of 8 - 4oz beers ($13) and the Jalapeno burger, medium. She got the quesadilla, a hard thing for a true Mexican girl to get at an American Fare place like BJ's.  For my palate, most of the beers were just okay, except for the Piranha Pale Ale - that was the best, but the fact that they have the sampler is what makes the beer experience. My burger was cooked to order, which is something that a lot of restaurants can't do for some reason. I wasn't thrilled about the jalapenos being deep fried since that takes away the heat and the flavor.  The burger was good - just good, nothing great and it came with an order of skinny fries.

No one came to refill our water, we literally had to find water and grab it for ourselves. What made this interesting was that we switched servers halfway and she never asked us if we needed anything, she was introduced and she soon left to serve other tables.  Everyone eventually started getting their food periodically and soon all the food was served EXCEPT mine. What ticks me off the most was the second server kept saying your food is almost done after everyone get their food but it never came. All the people at my table finished their food (even the slow eaters) before I got my pizza. I looked at my watch and it was an hour and a half since we ordered. This was ridiculous, it would have been kind of okay if the server didn't say that the pizza was almost ready every time but since she remembered I assumed that she was actually honest about it. Silly me!  Since I felt bad that my entire table was  waiting for me to get my food, I walked straight to the server and told her that I have waited for my food for this long and I don't want the pizza anymore. Luckily, the manager was there and he straightened things up...kind of. He got us all water, made sure that the pizza was actually being made and within 10ish minutes. Awesome right?  NOT!  When i got home and finally ate the pizza it wasn't even cooked all the way! The cheese wasn't melted,  the onions and bell peppers were still hard, and there wasn't enough tomato sauce. What the hell were they thinking when this happened? Oh lets tell the customer that we are making it when in actuality we are not. NO! Not cool. If I could give a 0 star I really would have because honestly this makes me not want to come to a BJ's ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=380

He wanted something light and I wanted something filling.  I went with the Chicken Club Sandwich and Fries...It was great.

They need much better communication at this place.  And seriously, I work at a restaurant myself and if I don't know an answer or am not sure of it ... I ASK!!  Don't go giving out wrong information people.  It makes for bad impressions and bitter people. If this never happened I would've given the place 3.5-4 stars.  But really, this experience just made all of us so angry.  We felt like they were treating us like scum just trying to get a deal ... when in reality we truly weren't.  And in the end, it was their fault for allowing someone so incompetent to pick up the phone and give out information.  Ugh!  Sorry BJ's, but I really am that disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=500

I had to leave the party early and asked for a separate check from the group of 20. The waiters head almost caught on fire from the short circuiting that took place after being asked this question. He told me he couldn't so I proceeded to convince him that in this day and age anything is possible with a calculator and lead No. 2 pencil.  Much later the poison came. I'm pretty sure they passed around my photo and a copy of my Yelp profile. They got it from Applebee's. They are both trying to kill me.  I had a BBQ Beef samich.

Jenny M.,"Saint Paul, MN",63,76,45,2.0,4/15/2010,"I had a couple of people tell me about the beer flights here, and since I'm a beer-lovin' kind o' gal, I was ready to go as soon as the opportunity presented itself. However, I was about to be sorely disappointed by my entire experience at BJ's... except for the Pizookie (more on that later).  First off, the service was not good. Not awful, but I served all through college and I know what results in this kind of service: over-management and under-respect, hallmarks of the chain restaurant server training that robs you of any individuality. Not the servers' fault, but still definitely worsens the customer experience. We also found ourselves sitting and waiting, and waiting, and waiting for service - this problem can be blamed a bit more on the server. Boring, contrived decor and atmosphere as well.  Food: way overpriced, and not at all good. I had the thai shrimp lettuce wraps, and could have made better at home with frozen pre-cooked shrimp and store-bought teriyaki sauce. Tried a bit of my co-eaters' pizza and fries, too - also nothing special, particularly for the high prices. The one bright spot was the Pizookie, which was a yummy cookie/ice cream pizza thing. It wasn't the best thing I've ever eaten, but I'd order one again.  Beer: not bad, and actually decently priced, but not worth putting up with the rest of the experience.  I couldn't decide at first if I should give this place two or three stars, since I tend to try to see the bright spots, but my general rule is if I'd go there again if dragged for a party or something and wouldn't complain too much, I give it three stars. If I got invited to a dinner taking place at BJ's, though, I'd beg, bribe, and cajole my way into trying to get it moved elsewhere.

Fast forward many months later and I went back to BJ's with a friend, to the bar, as we had some time to kill before watching ""The Hangover."" The bartender was extremely cool and friendly and the drinks were probably the best I have ever had (he had to look up how to make what we ordered and still did a wonderful job - his first time ever making the drink). He was constantly cleaning and making sure my friend and I were taken care of. The restaurant was fairly sparse that night as it was a weekday, but I have to say that I was very impressed with the ambiance and atmosphere. My thought was that of a great place. Fast forward (yet again) a few months later and I met a friend at BJ's for dinner. The place was packed (Saturday night) but the wait was not too long. The service was excellent - the food was average (but I believe that to be more about what I ordered and not of what can normally be expected from the establishment). My friend and I had a lot of time to kill before a movie so we really took our time enjoying our meals and having good conversation. We were never rushed by any of the staff. Went back a week or two later as I heard the pizza is some of the best made. My friend and I were seated right away. The place was busy but not packed (it was a Sunday evening). The waitress was extremely kind, helpful, and funny and the pizza was to me, the best that I have ever had (so much so that I ordered the same as takeout a couple of weeks later).

However, the 15 and 20% amounts were figured on the after tax total ! Why would anyone give a tip on the tax!? I never do! I tip on the pre-tax amount, as everyone should!  I did not care for this at all and I am sure most people would not bother to think about it, but just give the suggested tip amount so they wouldn't have to figure it out.

Andrew Z.,"Berkeley, CA",40,61,1,3.0,1/3/2010,"If you find yourself in the land of strip-malls (aka Natomas), BJ's isn't a bad option at all.  Most restaurant chains don't have a great line-up of brews to choose from, so based on that alone they get an extra star, up from what would otherwise be a 2 for an above-average chain.  My favorite, btw, is the Jeremiah Red Ale. Typically for dinner I would think you'd order pizza here, which is very good.  I hadn't really had much else until I tried the Balsamic Chicken last night, served with mashed potatoes, crispy onion strips, mixed greens, and sauteed onions (yes that's two onions!).  The Balsamic glaze was very tangy and went great with both the onion sides.  This is a fairly healthy option for a place like this, and quite tasty, I assure you. Plus, not only do they have a large bank of TV's behind the bar to watch while you wait for a table, but you may even see a few local sport-stars there like we did last night (Kings players Jason Thompson & Omri Caspi).  Top that, Apple Bee's!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=480

I don't write reviews on chain restaurants often because I'm not sure if anyone cares. Any BJ's I've ever been to is always busy no matter what time or day. I have just never received truly great service here (as with a lot of chain restaurants). Sometimes the servers are very personable, however still aren't present in their sections as much as they should be. I feel management or corporate gives these servers too large of a section to give optimum service. So basically when I come here (and I mean any BJ's cuz I have been to a few, and it's always the same), I'm coming for the food and not the service.  Some menu favorites of mine... The flat bread pizzas, the Cobb salad, the wedge salad, the sandwiches (with either thin or wedge fries-both delicious), and the pizzas.

We called ahead for a group of 7 and the table was ready just when they said it would be. That is the end of the positives. They appeared to be very busy and the waitress was definitely not lazy BUT the customer service was seriously unsatisfactory. So much so that the manager had to go around to various tables to apologize and explain that they had ""no shows"" in the kitchen.   After taking everyone's order, the waitress came back 5 minutes later to tell us that they were out of one of the items. The disturbing thing was that she didn't come back for 10 minutes to take the order again. Salads appetizers were delivered in two rounds. Half the table got theirs first. The other half got theirs 10 minutes later. If you're still with me and doing the math then you can see that we have been sitting her over 40 minutes by now. The one thing that really disturbed me (and I thought was pretty unforgivable) was that they did not give the 4 year old ANYTHING! They were slow (and they knew it) and nothing was served to the little one...even though he had ordered applesauce as his side dish. His mom had to ASK for it. The little angel never said a peep. His grouchy aunties and uncles were acting up more than he was.  Pizza was good as was the other dishes ordered by my companions (forgive me for not memorizing them). The much touted Pizookie was tasty. I liked the red velvet the best with cookies and cream a close second. I have to say though that it was slightly overrated. I didn't like how it stuck to the bottom of the metal pan. Isn't there a better way to make it? Food was decent but I would likely not return simply because of the service.

Lisa H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",124,306,17,4.0,10/25/2013,"It was my younger son's 2nd birthday and we were at the Sleeptrain for Disney On Ice. My youngest is probably the pickiest eater of the family, so for his birthday we wanted to get something we knew he would eat, so we decided to get his favorite foods of pizza, cookies and ice cream. We came for a slightly late lunch and they said they had to take a couple of minutes to get our table together. Once we were seated we ordered quickly. My mom and husband got small salads to start and the boys got applesauce. I decided I really didn't want pizza so I got their ahi tuna salad as an entree.  My salad was large, very fresh and full of good things, although I asked for them to remove the red peppers and they did not. They were big enough that I was able to easily pick them out. The tuna on it wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was decent and I liked the pickled cucumber in the salad. My family all loved the pizza and ate the majority of it with some leftovers to take home. Then the best part, on your birthday they will give you a Pizookie with ice cream and a candle in it.  I remember back in the day they used to give you a full-size Pizookie for your birthday, but now they give you a mini one. That was okay, since my son ate most of it on his own and the rest of us ordered another large one to split.  He was in cookie and ice cream heaven. The Pizookie is basically a deep dish cookie that they bring out hot with ice cream on it. They have several different types like a basic chocolate chip, a triple chocolate, a red velvet, oreo, etc. The full size ones are good for sharing and will feed three or four people. They also have a sampler, which is three of the mini ones, which is nice if you want to try several flavors. Although you still probably want to split it, unless you have a major sweet tooth.  Lunchtime seems to be busy, but not too crowded, whereas dinner at any BJ's particularly on the weekend can have significant wait times.

As we are being guided through the restaurant, we literally are seated in the very back corner of the restaurant, right by the little server cubby. Bad luck of the draw, sucks to be us, right?!? Then to top it off, our server had a stanky personality. He was grumpy, barely audible, grunted instead of speaking, and was curmudgeon like. I can deal with these last two things...but the deal breaker was that they were completely out of Peanut Butter Pizookie. These are literally my grown woman's crack, I live to eat these things any time I walk in to a BJ's. Our server came up and said ""...we are out of peanut butter,"" no remorse, no consoling, no customer service. He didn't ask if we still wanted anything, he just walked away. About 5 minutes later he dropped the check on our table, again, without a word being said. Our actual meals were not with their normal goodness either. I hope it was just an off night, because generally I absolutely love BJ's. The Mac-n-Cheese was extremely dry. Our Black & Bleu burger was came with the aioli when asked for on the side.

Those seats are usually for 3+ but he still seated us there on a crowded Saturday night! Yay for our waiter! We first ordered drinks - bf got a beer that I didn't try and I was stuck between two fruity drinks and asked the waiter to recommend me one.

When I saw it on the menu I thought it looked big but when I saw a waitress holding it....wow. Amazing. Lastly, atmosphere is great. Great place to hang out with friends (but you probably already knew that) and chill. They have TVs everywhere for you to watch your sports games and a bar area.

Though we could see the place was not packed, we still waited about 20 minutes to be sitted.  Once we got to our table, we notified our Server we only wanted dessert, she then went missing,  perhaps she figured her tip would not be a decent size tip due to us just wanting dessert, she comes back about 15 minutes later w a warm coffee, and my girlfriends  hot chocolate,   Time to get a refill on my coffee, she was MIA , comes back later on , perhaps 20minutes after she dropped off our first coffee/hot chocolate with my second refill and at that time she has the check for us...    So ... Bad experience, unnecessary waiting, bad service, did not get any more coffee , could not order more hot chocolate for my girl thou i knew there were no free refills on this, we were willing to pay for them .

I know).  We decided to get a bite and some drinks in the area.  I had never been to BJ's and until recently didn't realize there was one in SJ at Oakridge mall!  The place was packed w/ concertgoers and regulars.  We were given a buzzer and a 35-40 min wait time.  I think you can call ahead to be put on the buzz list.  That's something to think about if you're in a time crunch.  We decided on pizza, salad, and beer.  A winning combination right? Our pizza was half BJ's Classic Combo and half BBQ Chicken.  My friends got one of the light colored beers Brewhouse Blonde I think and I got a Nutty Brewnet (love a dark beer).  The Nutty Brewnet was good and packed a nice little punch even with a heavy meal.  I realized that when we got up from the table...whew.  I could have used a few more for the concert.  Our pizza came out pretty quickly.  I have to say I liked the Classic Combo slice better than the BBQ Chicken slice.  There was a little too much sweetness going on w/ the BBQ side between the sauce and the sweet red onion for my liking.  The crust was thick, yet crispy on the outside.  It reminded me of an old old old school Pizza Hut Pan Pizza crust but better.  Overall the service was fast even on a busy night, the pizza and beer were good.  I'll have to check out the San Jose location some time.  They do curbside take-out always a plus for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=520

Lorenzo G.,"West Sacramento, CA",14,14,19,1.0,9/11/2011,"I have been to this location twice. The first time I went to this BJ's, I went with a fairly large group of friends and we told the waitress that we would have to split the bill. Remember that because I'll mention it later. It took FOR EVER to have some one come and ask us what we wanted to drink and even longer to have someone take our orders. After waiting for so long, some members of our group even left the table to go order food at the bar. They got their food shortly after we got our drinks. When we FINALLY got our food, I got the wrong order. It was to go to the family behind us. When I let the waiter know, he just took the plate and gave it the man that ordered the dish. What if I talked or sneezed on it? When I finally got my order it was over cooked and the chicken was burnt. How do you mess up Chicken Alfredo? Hell, I can make it better than them!  I was reluctant to eat here a second time but I figured maybe they only sucked that one day. I was wrong. They just suck. Our server was nice but the food and my drink was awful. The appetizer was better than my burnt turkey burger. I couldn't even taste the turkey, just that burnt left-on-the-grill-too-long taste. The fries were OK. I ordered a Lemon Drop which wasn't nearly as thick and blended as the picture in the menu made it out to be. It was watered down, strong and diluted at the same time, and I could hardly taste any lemon in it. I had the waiter take it back and he said he'd have it taken care of. I never received another one but he didn't charge me for it and he waved the charges on my other two drinks (two Pepsi's) so that was very nice of him. I don't think I'll be going back here again. I'll just stick with the Cheesecake factory and enjoy the awesome Lemon Drops they have there.  (To the waiter who might recall this: your service was great but the food was awful.

Mia D.,"Sacramento, CA",543,295,65,3.0,1/28/2010,"Everytime I've been here this place has been busy.  And not just busy, it's extremely busy.  I'm usually here whenever someone is celebrating their birthday.  I think it's because of their birthday pazzookie...nom nom nom... Anyway, the last couple of times I've come here I've asked the same questions, do you accept reservations and how long is the wait.  Typical questions requesting honest answers right?  Well, why is it then the host staff are rude when they answer my question or don't answer it at all.  Sometimes I get a no they don't accept reservations or sometimes I get a yes but it's far off from the time that I was intending to request.  As for the answer to how long the wait is, they sometimes say 10-15 minutes which isn't bad if you have a ton of people with you but then they under guesstimate and your wait ends up being 30-45 minutes and they don't tell you that until you get up and complain. Anyway, I usually order the basics here...fish and chips, sliders, salad, soup.  My kids usually order the kids cheeseburgers and the chicken strips.  These are all the staples and not once have they messed up our order...thank goodness. Now the pazzookie (sp?) is another story.  This is one large cookie with tons of ice cream on top.  It's definitely made to be shared because it comes in a pizza pan.  This is the party order of course.  There's a smaller order but remember I usually come here with a big group. The beers aren't too bad either.  I had the raspberry one, which isn't really beer but it was good.  I'm not much of a beer drinking if you couldn't tell by what I ordered to drink. The bar always looks full so if I came here with a couple of friends to check out a game since there are a ton of tv's around, I don't think we'd have a spot to hang out ,even at the bar since it's always crowded, but one of these days I'll try it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=520

Daniel D.,"Concord, CA",827,462,315,4.0,7/14/2009,"I was in the area for a kickboxing tournament and was with a party of 6. definitely a great choice for an afternoon lunch on saturday. BS - BJ's are pretty consistent - huge menu, decent portions, but a little bit spendy - Service was attentive and pleasing  - Food is generally tasty - They always have a few good local beers on tap - full bar I enjoy BJ's because it's consistent. It's entirely possible to find places where it's hit or miss and I haven't experienced that whenever I've gone to BJ's. I've been to the following locations: San Jose, Fremont, Tanforan/San bruno and now Sacramento! Basically I came with a few of my boys, 6 of us total. If you're a pizza fan and you haven't tried BJ's Chicago deep dish, you're MISSING OUT! There are those people that like thin crust or no crust and they SUCK but here at BJ's they have awesome Deep Dish. Probably the BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had. The Mini is pretty small so if you're a big eater, step up to the next size which I believe is like 14 bucks! It's worth it tho. I got a Chicken Ceasar Salad. It was huge and had a little bit too much dressing but not anything to complain about. The chicken was smoky and grilled. It's what I expected. And I was a little bit nervous because I was competing so the salad hit the spot and still gave me some nourishment but didn't make me feel like I overate. Mostly everyone got pizza and they scarfed em down! lol.  Someone got a burger and said it was really good. I've never not gotten pizza at BJ's because I think that's what it's specialty is. Nevertheless I heard nothing but good things about my friends' dishes a cheese burger and a chicken sandwhich.  Also if you have enough room, you've got to get the pizookie. A trip to BJ's is entirely worth it if you get the pizookie. Enjoy this franchise because its so much better then any other I can think of... oh wait, its so much better then Uno's! haha Oh and last but not least, most BJ's are open until 12 or 1am so you have always have a late night brewski and a pizookie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=520

What  kind of a response is that?  Again, not about the cost but the principle/approach! He offered for us to take home a salad, which we said no to because who wants to eat a soggy salad the next day?   We didn't make a big deal about it, smiled and paid our bill.  We boxed up the rest of our pizza.  Consumed with our kids, we started to walk out of the restaurant without our box.  We realized about 45 seconds after we had left the table that we had forgotten the box and went back to the table.  It was gone!   They had already thrown it away.  Disappointed, we called the same manager on the phone while driving home about how quickly they had tossed our box (I mean jeez, maybe a little concern for the family with young kids...consider they may have just forgotten and come back in a few seconds?).  Maybe leave with the host for 2 minutes before tossing?   Instead, his response?  We coach our team to clear tables and reset ASAP so we can seat the next party.  So, we're just part of the herd they're pushing through to keep their numbers up?  Maybe but I've never had anyone be so obvious and unapologetic about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=520

Generally I go back and forth between the pizza and entree menu. Have to say my favorite pizza is the BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger. Sounds a little funny, but it is really good in taste and the ability to fill you up fast for such a personal pizza. If you choose to order off of the Entree' menu, you have to try the Jambalaya.

The food took forever to come out and not one person in our party was very impressed. My blue cheese burger was overcooked and dry. I had to order a side of mayo to moisten the burger up a little. It was obvious that my patty broke apart on the grill, yet the cook thought it was ok to put it back together and serve it, so i had a chunk fall out right away. The flatbread pizza was not very good, the 'gluten free"" thin crust pizza was basic, the cheese quesadilla was skimpy etc. This is a case of a big chain restaurant that puts no love into it's food and cannot keep up with a busy dining room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=580
Steve N.,"Brentwood, CA",199,453,403,3.0,7/6/2008,"Ya, BJ's is ok.  It looks very contemporary, like a reuse building that use to be a place where they manufactured steel or a warehouse.  However, it was built new.  Nice attempt and I liked the atmosphere.  Placed felt like it had some energy. The food was suppose to be good.  We heard the pizza was very good, clam chowder was good, and they had giant potatoes.  SoI try a personal pizza and it is very good.  My wife, Jenn, gets a basic baked potato.  It was fine to me.  Maybe you can't really get an ""amazing potato"" these days.  It seems like I've had really good ones that were smaller at home.  The kids got kids foods, i.e. chicken this or that.  Nothing special to report here. Prices were ok. not great.  Parking was not bad.  I'd like to go back sometime with some friends and soak it in again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=580
Lana h.,"Sacramento, CA",19,27,1,3.0,10/22/2012,"I have had BJ's pizza many times with each time being worst than the last. First time I had it I thought it was amazing and worth every penny. The crust was fluffy, and crispy. Loaded with cheese and all sorts of toppings. I feasted that night. Second time, the dough was old and pretty much ruined the pizza. The third time, over this past weekend it was not fully cooked. The dough was still white and raw inside, the cheese had not melted, and the pepperoni was layed out in stacks. It was 3 or four slices on pepperoni on top of each other in one spot with the rest of the slice empty. Some slices even had no pepperoni. This pizza cost over $20 by the way. Little Caesar's would have done a better job for $5. Just a huge disappointment. I'm giving them one last shot. Right now it's at a 33% success rate, if it dips to 25% I will have to reevaluate my entire life. I may have to take time off work to get it figured out. BJ's is a huge part of my life and I hope I won't have to replace it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=580
Jeffrey L.,"San Jose, CA",8,15,,3.0,9/18/2008,"BJ's is always solid, the environment is laid back and the servers are always really courteous and accomodating. Downside of this particular BJ's is that it is always packed. ALWAYS PACKED. I went this past Monday at 8 pm, for a 30 minute wait. I came a month ago for lunch, 20 minute wait. Last semester, everytime I went was at least a 20 minute wait.  Depending on the night too, the crowd can be docile or rambunctuous as all hell. During the Cowboys/Eagles game this past Monday, they must have split the restaurant between the Dallas and Philly fans, because everytime something happened the whole place was in uproar. It was fun for me and my buddy because we were watching the game and having a beer. But for those poor 3 families that decided to celebrate their kids' birthday that night, it must have been terrible. In any case, this restaurant has solid food but is a hit or miss depending what are you going there for, a family restaurant or a sports bar.

Julie Q.,"Sacramento, CA",6,4,,1.0,12/30/2007,"Went with my sister on a a Sunday night at 8:30 (before Kings game ended) and waited for over 20 min after being told it would be 5.  (note:  there were several empty tables so they must've been short a server or something...)  We were seated at an up front table that was blasted with cold air every time someone opened the door.   Ordered drinks, appetizer, salads and pastas.  Unfortunately, we waited with an empty table (no place settings and no drinks) until they brought the main entrees.  Totally forgot our drinks, appetizers and salads.  Manager noticed and came by to tell us she would comp our food.  Regardless, marginal food and crappy service.   On another note, I guess we weren't treated any different than other guests - in fact, while we waited for  for our food to arrive we noticed a few of the Kings players and their friends arrive and wait for a table.  Again, there were plenty of empty tables but they kept these guys waiting over 25 minutes with empty tables nearby.  I thought Francisco Garcia was going to go crazy waiting for a place to sit down. For such a large restaurant it's amazing that the wait is so long, the bar is so crowded and there are so many BJ's staff standing around the front desk chatting.  I am done with the place.  Too many other options available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=580

It's first come first serve and we would have had to wait about 20 minutes for a regular table. Don't bother cuz you'd get the same service near the bar.  I took a look at the menu and realized this place was just like the Cheesecake Factory without the cheesecake. They just replaced it with beer. Note: beware of places that offer a wide range of culinary choices...they never do it right. I did get the BJ's burger and it was mmm-mm-tasty. I cut it in half cuz it was so huge I couldn't possibly eat it, and the juice was running down meat. The potato wedges that came with it were really good too, I ate quite a few before I got to my burger. Outside was nice and crunchy and the inside was nice and fluffy soft. Maybe it came from a package, but I don't care. Burger and fries was worth it for about $8.  I'd give this place 5 stars if it were based on just the food but we also ordered the Pizookie, which you really can just make at home with Nestle Tollhouse mix and grocery store ice cream. And I don't mean Haagen Daazs, I mean Safeway ice cream. Seriously, those are the only two things that comprised the Pizookie. My sister ordered the shrimp linguine which was only okay...I can and have made better.

He should know since he won a certificate naming him an honorary brew master. I, on the other hand, know nothing of beer ways. As for the food, I've only had the pizza and the calzone, which was fair to middlin'. But I've heard that the salads are okay.  There is always a long wait, too, but you can sit at the bar if space allows. A few months ago we had to wait over an hour, and two women got in a car wreck out front and one wanted to fight; it was quite entertaining.  Back inside BJ's, the service is often sloppy, thus the three stars. The staff is not terribly attentive, and last time we went we had to wait forever for our pizza because they dropped it on the floor and had to bake a replacement.

Rachelle B.,"San Diego, CA",293,543,125,5.0,7/20/2010,"Hot as hell, and in the mood for a drink, my boyfriend drove aimlessly around downtown looking for somewhere to eat... and park. It was so frustrating, so we decided to head to Natomas for dinner instead. Since I'm not from Sacramento, and my boyfriend had already taken me to his favorite places, we just couldn't decide where to go. And the last thing we wanted to do was pay for parking... again. I had to be at Sacromento airport in a few hours anyway, so this was a good choice. We were going to try Carino's, but I saw BJ's across the way, and we both decided that that sounds much better than some random Italian joint that we have never been to before. I can never pass up going to BJ's, it's just too awesome, even if it is a chain. Their food is consistently good, no matter which location you go to. We sat at the bar, which was nearly empty. Pretty crazy for 4 PM on a sunday afternoon. Every BJ's I've gone to is always packed, no matter what time of day it is, so this was very nice. I had the Nit Wit, a Belgian wheat beer and BF had a captain and diet. Of course, we had to get the chips and salsa (I always loved them here, they're made of red, white and blue corn). I decided to have the fish tacos, which I surprisingly have not tried yet. The tacos, along with about 15 other items were listed toward the back of the menu as ""under 670 calories"" nice for me, since I try to watch what I eat nowadays. BF ordered the turkey cobb sandwich. Tacos were large, and it came with 2, with a side of chips, an avocado creme, and salsa. Loved the tacos, especially with the avocado creme, but I used it sparingly. It was too good to be ""low-fat"". I was almost full after just one taco, so I just decided to eat just the fish and cabbage from the other taco. Not a huge fan of flour tortillas. I think they'd be much better on corn tortillas. They were still really tasty. Fish is nicely cooked and light, not dry or greasy. BF said his sandwich was also very good. The bartender was very nice. She happily suggested a few drinks to us and we took her word on it, she was awesome. BF was very happy to see that she put in a little extra of something in his mai-tai. Brownie points for her. She also made sure our water glasses were full, and asked us periodically, but not annoyingly, if we needed anything else. Loved it.

Im sorry but i dont care how busy you are and what you wanna do after work. You were horrible. You didnt even bother to come by and say that our food is coming soon at least or apologize.

I wouldn't come here if you are on a diet.  Most of the entrees are well over 1000 calories, and when my fiancee ordered off the ""healthy"" menu, her tilapia was terrible.

As long as I didn't skip lunch I can get by with eating only half and saving the other for lunch. If I hit Happy Hour the pizza is half price and that is one great deal. I also love their balsamic chicken and Parmesan crusted chicken. If going for lunch you have to get there before noon or wait 45 minutes. At dinner my friends and I grab a table at the bar. The service is always fast and friendly. A friend wanted to buy me dinner for my B-day but she had a flight to catch so we went here.  Quick friendly service and when the waiter asked what flavor I wanted for dessert I assumed that was a scoop of ice cream - nope it was a pizookie and on the house.  GREAT!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=560

When I was here last year, the service was awful and the food was mediocre, but tonight was a different story. When we got there, the hostess said it would be a 5 minute wait for our table but after 10 minutes we decided to just sit in the bar. There was one table left and we ordered drinks while waiting for the pager to buzz. After another few minutes we just ordered our food and asked our waitress to just tell the hostess we found a table in the bar (it had been nearly half an hour since we first walked in). This time, the service was fast and the waitress was nice (unlike the people I encountered last time) and most of all the food was a lot better. The only downside was that our table was in-between two other tables so it was like sitting with a group of strangers who would rather you sit somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=560

The mini pizza (half off at happy hour) tasted exactly like any other frozen pizza.  5. I couldn't imagine any one wanting to pay $10 for their mini pizza. Food is over priced for what they give you.

The place wasn't very busy - the big back room was virtually empty, and we sat at a table near the door. Our waitress came and took our drink order, which included a cup of hot water to heat the girls babas because they were famished. A few minutes later, out comes half of our drink order, no hot water. Several minutes later, she brings us all glasses of ice water, which we didn't ask for, and no hot water. So we politely reminded her that we would like some hot water, as she was taking our food orders. So, out comes the rest of the drinks and our chips and salsa - and no hot water. We all kind of looked at each other like ""wtf?"". We all watched as she hurried around to her other tables, clearing off their dishes. Finally I had enough and flagged her down, again requesting some hot water. As we were waiting on that, three different people came out and brought our food. They asked if we needed anything else, and we requested three ranches. She finally showed up with the hot water, and by that time, my glass of lemonade had been dry for far too long, as well as our beer and ciders. We had random people dropping off ranches, and then when she finally came back with refills, even she brought three ranches. It was ridiculous! Total lack of communication.

This place has a wide range of menu items. The thought of Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza is a wonderful thing to think about, ordinarily. BJ's has the right idea. The little pizza lifter so it's above the table, the server delivers it with a huge clamp because the dish is still hot, and they even serve up your first slice. This was awkward at first, but it's kind of nice. You see all the melted cheese and it get's you all excited. You bite into it and, well, the cheese is kind of odd. It's watery and kind of flavorless. It's the same at both BJ's we've tried. The rest of their food is sort of ho hum.

The menu has a wide range of options, I can never decide what I want to eat. The appetizers are GREAT! Gotta have the sliders, make sure to add cheese and bacon. PotStickers are also wonderful, Pizza is okay, not a big pizza fan though, my husband likes the pizza. Haven't tried the pasta, but probably wouldn't, will save eating pasta dishes for when I am eating at an Italian restaurant. I will say though that the Halibut Fish Tacos are to die for, I have had them twice and both times were great. The beer is good too, if you are a beer drinker and not picky about your beer I would greatly recommend the sampler, you get 6 oz. of six or seven different kinds of beer, the Jeremiah Red was my fave. The atmosphere is great, they play good music and my husband can keep up on his sports from anywhere in the restaurant.

monika l.,"San Francisco, CA",56,106,,1.0,12/27/2006,"What a joke this corporate franchise is! I have tried to do this place justice by going on three different occasions. When visiting the soon to be in-laws last week, my hubby and I decided to grab a bite and a beer before having to ""deal"" with the weekend. The wait was about an hour and a half. (And to think we were actually going to wait). We grabbed our ""vibrator"" and headed to the bar. The wait for a drink was apx. 20 minutes. And we waited patiently...for 20 minutes. I finally said something and they barked at me for not waiting my turn. Umm..Yea. It gets better. I wait 5 more minutes and they ask for my order and my ID. Until they see my 31 year old fiance's. They won't serve him. Why you ask? Because he just went to the DMV , and they hole punched his ID and gave him a paper one as well. They original wasn't even expired. SO ridiculous!  Back to the actual review and me not venting. Blue collar American families going ape shit in a restaurant with kids running around and dads getting drunk off of poor quality beer.  You would think with that much room to brew that they would have some quality instead of mass quantity. The pizza, is about as lack lusting as the beer. So many toppings that you lose the realization of eating pizza. There are better ways to ""fill"" a pizza space. Go to Zelda's downtown. They'll show you. The price is above average for the amount. Moving from Sac to the city, you realize that  there are just as many good pizza places in Sacramento as there are in the city. You just have to find them. And this my friend is not one of them. Andrew K. below me compared this to Zachary's in Berkeley, and JB's isn't even close. The management needs to take a few courses in ""turn over rate"" and ""working with your customers"".  Do me a favor and save your $50 bucks for two bad beers, a pizza with  flash frozen veggies and flavorless sauce, and a ""pizookie"" cookie with cheap vanilla ice cream and toll house ""thaw and cook"" cookies.  Go somewhere where they actually care about you/food. You'll be happy you spent the money elsewhere.

Four stars for the lunch experience.  For one- this BJs is huge, but can get packed very quickly.  During a weekday lunch ""rush,"" you're almost guaranteed a seat.  They sat us in a small booth for two, with clear views of the large LCD screens above us blasting the London games.  One point for that! The lunch specials were great!  All were roughly $7, and looked delicious. * Fried Chicken Lunch Special ($7)   - a slab of white, chicken meat, breaded and shaped as a country fried steak.  With a generous helping of MASHED POTATOES and corn on the side, this was the perfect ""Welcome Back!"" entree for someone like me. * Avocado Wraps ($8)   - Vegetarian friendly, and made a great appetizer for us!  Six crispy wraps loaded with generous amounts of Californian avocado.  With a tangy dipping sauce on the side, this was to die for. * Chicken Potstickers... to be honest, this wasn't even a part of our order!  Our waitstaff had accidentally served this to us, and were happy enough to give it to on us on the house.  Points for that!  This would never happen in Asia.

Anne T.,"Sacramento, CA",121,69,17,1.0,5/19/2015,"I've been to this BJs probably between 5-10 times, mostly getting take out for myself and co-workers at work. This BJs location is atrocious for takeout-- they consistently get my orders wrong and make no effort to correct it when I call. At least 3 times, I've picked up my takeout only to arrive back at the office to discover that one or more items have been left out. When I've called BJs to inform them of the missing items, they tell me that I can either A) drive all the way back over for a refund or B) that they will mail me a gift card in the mail. A gift card? Since I either paid with a credit card or cash I expect to be refunded with either a credit to my account or send me a check. What good does a gift card do me?  Not wanting to drive all the way back out there, however, twice I picked option B and told them to mail me a gift card. Guess what? Both times they failed to send me out my refund on a gift card. I called to follow up with managers twice and was told a gift card for my refund would be promptly in the mail. They never came. This is basically tantamount to theft since I never got what I paid for and they never refunded me my money. The last time it happened I did drive back to receive a cash refund (though that does not compensate me for my time and mileage driving over there).  Yes, I probably should have checked out each order but the thing is that when you are picking up take out for a large group of people and are on a tight lunch schedule it is often impractical to check everything thoroughly to make sure that everything is there. This is their job and I expect it to be done correctly. It never is. I'm either missing items and/or the items are not as ordered. The worst part for me though is the lack of making it right by the managers when they get it wrong--specifically in failing to refund my money when I didn't get the item I paid for. I estimate I've lost about $30 in orders I did not receive a refund for from this location.

"" the waiter says, ""oh sorry, i forgot"" Finally after probably an hour of waiting, he brings our drinks, i take a bit of the Great White pizza and for some reason it tasted like Cinnamon i look at the inside to see what it is and there is a thin line of red sauce i immediately stop eating. My Father and i didn't complain.. that night we ended up feeding our dogs the pizzas.

I guess they preferred us all to stand in the bar and drink!! Once seated, we had a very attentive waitress. I've only eaten the French Dip Sandwich there as it's to die for. But, as options were not available, I had 1 of the 4 various deep dish pizzas, the Mediterranean. More dough/bread that toppings, and none of it had any distinctive flavor. Not one for deep fried anything, i passed on all appetizers.

mariza r.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",31,213,29,4.0,7/5/2007,"to be clear, i only put 4 stars because of the wait that is associated with this place-- i do not usually experience any wait because we take a late lunch or early dinner-- you will leave full.  this place is supposedly known for its pizza, but with an expensive addiction to this place, i have yet to order one as the main course. i have had the appetizer one (pesto cilantro) and it was mighty tasty-- especially because we topped it with some of the shrimp from another dish (ps- i think its2 dollars off any appetizer during happy hour-- sit in the bar area) i dont think i've ever had something here that i did not like. lunch and half sizes are a scam.. you get half the food for $2 less than the whole price-- get it all and just take it home. the portions here are LARGE, dont take the portions as a challenge.. give in to the leftovers box.. we personally never make it to desert but you do get a free pizookie on your birthday-- just mention its your birthday.  now to the serious stuff-- the shrimp pasta (either of the two) is great. the bbq beef sandwhich is amazing. the ribs are fantastic (ask for extra sauce on the side and wet naps)-- do not get the baked potato-- go with the mashed-- the gravy is--- just do it.. but the creme of the crop-- strawberry lemonade- aka the main reason i go to BJ's. i love sugar, and perhaps it is because i get it with no ice, but its super sweet. i do think it depends on the location though because the BJ's in Orange County has a legit amount of sweetness.  average cost for 2 is $40-50, and the service does slow down if it's busy- but if you have a good server it isnt that bad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=640

Derrick H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,18,5,3.0,7/13/2007,"Located in the Sacramento Gateway, BJ's Restaurant is just another corporate franchised restaurant serving typical American favorites; pizza, salad, pasta, burgers and fries, in a hip, yet modern setting. With an on tap brewery and bar littered with plasma tvs on the walls, this place tends to fill up during weekends and venues at Arco Arena. The food is nothing really special, somewhat expensive for the quantity and quality offered. However, I was here for the drinks, and the lady, the desserts. We had a pizookie, a hot chocolate chip cookie slapped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Its amazing how these 2 go so well together, but for $6.95, I am not sure if it is worth that price. The beers are good, my fav is the darkest beer on tap, with its sweet yet smooth flavor. This place is not worth manuvering leaps and bounds in the parking lot for the food, but for a night of good drinks, and pazookie.

Camille C.,"Sacramento, CA",25,162,3,1.0,4/8/2007,"We came with a group of 5 on a Saturday evening, so we had to wait 45 min. No biggie--it was to be expected.  However, the service was bad, horrible, and even worse. First of all, we were seated in the very back corner of the restaurant (no more than 2 feet away from the emergency exit and where the servers come in/out of the kitchen) at a table that really seats 4, despite the fact that there were other tables open. If we made any movements or gestures, we surely would've knocked a tray out of a server's hands. Our waiter takes our order, brings our drinks, and after what seemed like forever, had a different server bring us 2/5 dishes. After another 15 minutes, the other 3 dishes are brought out by yet another server. One of those dishes was a salad, and the other an appetizer (chili cheese fries)--I have no idea why it would take THAT long for those dishes to be prepared. Our original waiter comes by to let us know that he'll be taking his break and some other server will be ""helping"" us. We never saw our original waiter again. I asked for some ketchup for my burger and fries, which were now cold as I didn't have the heart to eat my food before my friends got their orders, and THAT took forever to come too. We should've known better, but we ordered dessert, and that also took forever. It even took forever for them to pick up our bill so we could pay and get the hell out of there. I've been to other BJ's, and I'd say their food is generally worthy of about 3 stars, but the service here was non-existant.

Yeah, its a chain restaurant, and at one point I called it my favorite ""default chain."" The wait sucks if you are attempting to eat here on a Fri/Sat night, their biggest customers are loyal chain-goers who know of nothing better. I would like to scream out loud that all of their pastas suck, pasta is such a delicate word. They should just call it ""bad sauce and noodles."" Their portions should give you three meals, and if you can eat one plate in a single seating... I'd go get your cholesterol checked. I'm a NY-style pizza girl myself, so I will spare you from my Chicago-deep-dish negativity. I will say that the ""Spinach Artichoke"" is a flavor overload, I thought I could never get enough garlic, I thought wrong... I ended up scraping off the entire topping and just eating the crust. SO WHY THREE STARS? 1. Believe it or not... YOU SHOULD ORDER A SALAD AS A MEAL, cause they are damn good. Yeah, yeah, a salad is just glorified rabbit food. No seriously though, the Santa Fe is both tasty and filling, as well as many of the other salads. 2. Their menu satisfies a wide range of palettes, take a big group and they'll probably find something to be happy with. 3. Can't vouch for the beer, but the ROOT BEER is the best ever. 4.

My Mom had the Roast Beef Dip and the first one was ice cold as were her fries - the bartender (we sat at the bar) was kind enough to replace it - which took forever - he even spoke to TWO managers to try and speed things up. When it came out - very little meat, non-melted cheese - overall BAD - Mom was NOT happy. Then one manager came over and she complained about the amount of meat and he says ""oh, it's pre-packed in baggies, let me check..."" never saw him again. Dad's mac n' cheese was discusting, we all tasted it - gross, and also not hot. Then, the bartender gave us a sample of an upcoming Spring Salad of mixed greens, watermelon and feta - the salad and melon were totally wilted and there was absolutely no flavor to the ""light balsamic vinagrette"".

BJ's is a blue-collar Cheesecake Factory.  Over-the-top decor with a high-end but folksy Americana theme, extremely loud, nothing on the menu under 1200 calories.  There are perhaps three vegetarian options on the menu.  I got the Ceasar salad, it wasn't bad but not amazing either.  Other veg options: garden salad, veggie pizza, veggie burger.  Maybe buried somewhere in their novel-length menu are other veg-friendly dishes, but I can only read so fast.  And yes, I realize by being a (mostly) veg I bring this on myself at places like this ;) The service was quick and friendly.  Beer was mediocre, but at happy hour prices, I certainly wasn't complaining.  Basically, their lager tasted like Bud.  The unfiltered wheat was good.  They have about a million beer choices, so perhaps I just made a poor one.   Three stars for good prices, service, and beer selection . . .  but just don't expect much from the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=600
Allison B.,"Chico, CA",57,108,21,5.0,3/26/2010,"I'll gladly drive an hour from Yuba City to Sac just to eat here.

patrick w.,"Sacramento, CA",235,253,24,4.0,8/26/2009,"i've been here a few times, usually at my brothers request. always has been pretty tasty and good service. tonight though, i experienced something in the way of customer service that i believe is worth mentioning somewhere. i came by to meet some family for drinks and a bite to eat in the e gizzy. the waitress i had was real nice, and i got  my standard three refills of diet coke which i believe is mandatory for decent service. The food comes out, mine is not served...i honestly didnt even realize that my food was over 20 minutes getting to me....  the manager comes out of nowhere and says ...we have a problem...your foods taking longer than i like to see...im going to comp your food for you... proactive customer service is amazing. i do this often in my job and honestly i appreciate it when people take the initiative to do so. he has personally made me a fan of the restaurant. ..plus the avocado spring roll type dish i had was awesome... kudos",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=600
Richard G.,"Antioch, CA",13,31,,5.0,5/28/2010,"oh bjs, we finally got to meet. after hearing raves and reviews, i needed to check this place out and tango face to face. Menu has a nice selection. I went and ordered the fish tacos. That right there is a meal that will keep you full probably for the rest of the day!  although i rarely pair my meals with a beer, i gave it a shot and tried their brew. first cup was a light hef and then the second i stepped up with a dark. not bad and if u have any room left, dont forget the pizookie! its worth it overall, good service. a place i'll consider for a birthday gathering of some sort or just a good ole family outing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=600

Andrew K.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",27,55,1,3.0,10/25/2006,"Yes, it's a chain - but they serve great beer and good food.  Their deep dish pizza doesn't compare to Zachery's in Berkeley, however, it fills and hits the spot nonetheless.  Of the beers, their piranha is a bit too hoppy for my tastes, but I really enjoy their jeremiah red.  +3 for the beers, +1 for the food, -1 for the inevitable wait to get seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=600

Gina B.,"Rio Linda, CA",0,124,45,5.0,11/26/2011,"One of my top favorite restaurants in Sac. There is always something delicious on the menu. The best avocado egg rolls and you MUST try a pizookie! It's a giant cookie with ice cream on top straight out of the oven.

Rob B.,"Sacramento, CA",171,168,23,3.0,2/5/2010,"Generally a decent place.  Beer is ok; the recent special Grand Cru brew was excellent.  Food is ok.  I typically have one of their sandwiches or pizza's.  My wife likes the Turkey Club.  I usually get thin crust; its well made, although the sauce is a little on the sweet side.  My three kids love it, which is primarily why I go.  All in all, generally a good experience, although when they get busy you can expect the quality of the service to go down dramatically.  Tip:  For lunch, get there by 11:30 AM, for dinner by 5:00, and you will be seated immediately.  Get there any later, and you can wait a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=600
wendy r.,"Sacramento, CA",5,37,,3.0,6/19/2011,"Not the best, not the worst. I agree with earlier reviewer who said don't expect and service or attention from the the hostess stand. My husband and I have been here many times and never fail to get a laugh out of the mysteriously snobby attitude of the BJ's Natomas hostess stand. This isn't Claw in New York for gosh sakes (think movie ""Date Night"").  It is kind of funny. The place is mediocre, pizza was not very good and this is their specialty, mind you! Burgers are good, salads are pretty good. It's so-so. Service is ok. Wait staff is always pretty friendly, but lacking in good customer service skills. BJ's manager, if you read this, I have tons of restaurant and customer service/hotel experience, I would be glad to offer you my services and train your staff to provide superior, top notch, knock-their-socks-off service. There is actually a technology behind it, it doesn't always work to just tell your staff to be nice or try to give good service, you have to show them how to do it. It's called training. In fact, the only place we had good service in our 6 years of living in Sacramento has been at Ella downtown on K street. The waiter did in fact knock our socks off with his superb service. Good thing too because food was not great and way over priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sacramento-6?start=600
