Anthony S.,"Norcross, GA",55,7,,4.0,9/27/2017,"Excellent. Peruvian quinoa with salmon was delicious. Salmon was a touch crispy on top for my taste but the tomatoes, mushrooms, and rich quinoa were just what I was looking for.  If you like theirs tomato sauce then I'd recommend the dish. Either way job well done. Excellent service for moderate $$",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2
Shawn W.,"Far West Side, San Antonio, TX",122,470,2428,3.0,10/22/2017,"Good service, good selection, and a good amount of deals offered at BJs.  I lived near a BJs in Maryland and never went to it.  It was one of those.  Oh I have time to go and time ran out.  Luckily moving here there is a BJs not too far from me.  I am glad there is as on my few visits to this place it offers some pretty good food and adult libations.   I have gone here mainly at lunch time and service has always been quick and attentive during the higher volumes.  Checkout their daily brewhouse specials they have going on Monday through Thursday and score a deal.  Also I would suggest downloading the BJs app to your phone so you can earn credits to freebies and get your free birthday gift from them.  The bartenders are friendly and do a pretty good job on the mix drinks as I have sampled more than a few drinks.  I am usually not a beer drinker but they offer this one particular cider known as berry burst.  I am a cider guy and this is one of those ciders I wish they sold in stores.  A very tasty in house brew to enjoy. The food is on par with many other chains that fill this spot in serving this particular selection of food and the choices are much the same.  One big difference is that BJs offers pizza.  They offer what is referred to as deep dish pizzas but to me it is not truly a deep dish pizza that you might be thinking of if you are thinking of a Chicago deep dish pizza.  It is more of a thick pan pizza and the crust is very airy and light.  Good pizza but everyone seems to be finicky when it comes to pizza.  It is on the level of many nationwide pizza chains.  The appetizers I have tried are pretty good but like the pizza it is on the level of many other chains. Good spot to have some food.  I don't think it will let you down but for me it did not wow me in terms of the food.  Now the drinks I will say were something that will have me returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2
Donovan T.,"San Antonio, TX",315,372,371,5.0,9/1/2017,"I have become a regular to BJ's. BJ's brews their own beer and it is amazing. When I come to BJ's for a beer I only drink their personally brewed beers. They have some custom beer mixes that you can choose from as well. I usually get the Hopstorm mixed with the stout. This was my first visit to this location. It was also my first time using the BJ's app. The app is really cool. You can keep track of your rewards, place a call ahead reservation, pay your bill and more.  Our waitress was on top of things. Come to think of it I don't think I have ever had bad service at BJ's.  Keep an eye of for their specials. On this visit they had a half rack of ribs, 2 sides and a mini pazooki for 13 bucks. The half rack was enough for me. Once we were ready to leave all I had to do was use ApplePay on the BJ's app and our transaction was seamlessly complete.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2
Brent L.,"San Antonio, TX",256,706,1302,5.0,8/3/2017,"Great options for carnivores as well as vegans!  I had the Superfood salad which was humongous and full of superfoods such as blueberries, kale, etc.  See the description on the menu. The GF had the Mediterranean chicken tacos on pita bread and it looked so good and she said it was good too. Service was great - about a 20 minute wait on a Saturday night around 6pm wasn't too bad either. Crazy dessert options too - try the baked beignet loaded with ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream.  Devilishly delicious but like half the calories of the Pizookies that they have on their menus.  If you do want a Pizookie, sign up for the rewards club before you go and you can get a free one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2

Sarah F.,"San Antonio, TX",26,223,7,2.0,7/30/2017,We came for lunch on a Saturday. We were seated right away and the place was not busy. We ordered our food and it took over 30 minutes to come out. The root beer wings tasted like plain BBQ and they were not even hot. The thin crust cheese pizza was not cooked all the way and was soggy. The Mediterranean chicken pita tacos were a disappoint.

Adrian Z.,"San Antonio, TX",0,14,2,1.0,12/3/2017,"So I'm back, because out of town guests chose this location. Place is still half ass. My guests ordered beer flights and one of them had a cracked glass. He asked for it to be replaced and they topped off the glass with beer and brought the same glass back. He brought it to her attention again, that time it was fixed. A sirloin was ordered at my table medium well. It came well done and charred on one side almost like it was forgotten. BJs charges quite a bit for their food. None of it should be anything less than ordered. I don't care for a redo  like last time or my money back. I just want to tell people that expect BJs food to go to the RIM location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2

Love the flatbread pizzas but my go to is definitely the Parmesan crusted chicken with DOUBLE MASH.Mmmmm. The drinks are good but expect to pay $9 or more for a tasty margarita. I love the rewards you get through the app definitely worth signing up for. Also like that you can pay on your app. This location has been open about 6 years now I would say and I have never had a bad experience.

I always bragged about your consistency in food flavor, presentation and price. My husband and I ordered the fish/shrimp taco plate; we asked for no onion. Tortilla's were cold and hard and flavorless and my shrimp taco had onions in the taco. As faithful patrons I was extremely dissatisfied with my food! My step daughter ordered the lasagna and said it was just ok and that she would not order this again. From a 1-5; 5 being the best, she gave your dish a 3.

Megan Z.,"San Antonio, TX",49,9,5,2.0,8/4/2016,"My fiancé and I went there last night for dinner. The wait time for our food to come out was about an hour. We ordered the seafood and chicken tacos. The waitress, Sydney, was nice enough. She apologized about 5 times for the wait.. Meanwhile, the people (also a table of 2) who were sat after us ordered, received their food and left the restaurant before our order even came out. The waitress's excuse was ""I put your order in, we have had so many complaints from everyone tonight!""... Bravo, great response. This was my first time at this location and  needless to say (I feel the need to say it anyway) it wasn't a very pleasant experience. I didn't see a manager walking around to greet tables or handle the ""so many complaints"" as I was told. To top it off, I tried using their nifty app to pay my 50 dollar tab, it was advertised that you get 20% off for using the mobile pay option.. It didn't apply the discount so we had to wait even longer for the ""manager"" to approve the discount.. When we were finally able to leave, the waitress kindly handed me a coupon for a free desert (with purchase of entrée of course) which was expired.. Thanks a lot! We don't go out very often so it's very disappointing to have a such bad experience. On another note, the food was great (hence why I gave 2 stars instead of 1). Just wish the manager and staff knew a little something about customer service.. Rant over, hope no one else has the same experience.  I would also like to note, I recognize that $50.00 isn't a lot of money, I would hope that this isn't the reason we were put on the back burner. I have previously worked in the restaurant business (though it was years ago) and I understand that things happen, a lot. We did not throw a fit of any sort. I have been in the customer service industry, different field, which is why I am writing such a review. I always appreciate any feedback I receive, as I cannot be everywhere at once, so I may correct the issue. My hopes are that you will do the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=40

Patrick G.,"San Antonio, TX",107,801,35,3.0,7/25/2015,"I'm going to steal another line from Jerry Seinfeld and mention that no member of the wait staff should shake your hand when you sit down at their table.  Anyone who is handling food shouldn't be touching patrons as they enter for a meal. The restaurant itself is exactly what one would expect at a casual chain brew pub.  The dining area is massive and the bar seemed even bigger.  Good thing they had ample parking to fit all of the patrons that can eat at this location.  This was a good thing because the place was packed during my most recent trip here. There were a few items labeled ""new"" on the menu and I went with the bacon guacamole deluxe burger ($11).  It was an extremely large amount of food for such a low price.  The bun was probably the best part of the burger as it was buttery and grilled so it had crispy edges.  The guacamole really overpowered the burger because there was more guacamole than any other ingredient.  I did like the jalapenos used to spice it up though.  Diners also get the option of thin cut fries or potato wedges with seasoning.  They both sounded good and the thin cut fries were good enough. The wait staff seemed really busy and managed to forget about our table a lot.  We ended up sitting after our meal for about 30 minutes when the bill was dropped off.  I understand they were busy, but I watched a lot of them not being able to multitask.  They would get distracted and walk right by a lot of the times. Overall, this place is a good casual option for a cheaper bite to eat.  I want to try the beer as it sounds very good but it was a little pricey.  I will definitely go back but this place won't be anything I get excited for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=40

The cookie was still warm and the caramel and chocolate chips were a  perfect combination. The mini size was good for one or it would also be enough for two to share.

James S.,"San Antonio, TX",364,109,180,5.0,6/18/2015,"Maybe I'm biased, but this BJ's has a great waitstaff lineup. Every visit (and I visit often) kicks off well because of prompt, energetic & friendly service. During peak hours, however, expect to wait no less than 30 minutes to first be seated. I've yet to experience one bad or disappointing beer/wine at BJ's, and on that note their drink selection is very large. Of equal size is their menu... an abundance to choose from... something for everyone's taste. And trust me when I say: NONE of their food offerings are weak! Moreover, portion sizes are more than satisfactory and prices far more than justified! BJ's atmosphere is casually upscale, lack of seating choices never an issue. Televisions are plenty and the crowd usually lively. Ultimately, whether for an intimate date or a daily bar hang or that dinner party of 12, this place is versatile enough to fit the bill without qualm. Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)...

I was recently there on Monday, February 1st with a party of 20 or so at 2:00 in the afternoon for a farewell luncheon for three of my husband's coworkers. We were some of the first there. I ordered a rootbeer and the ahi tuna salad at 2:05.  The root beer came out quickly enough, but it was pretty flat and had little carbonation. It was the first time I had it, so I'm not sure if that was normal. I had only one since I didn't want a refill.  A 2:45 I asked how much longer my salad would be. That's 40 full minutes after ordering an entree that's barely cooked - the tuna is barely seared - and the rest is lettuce. Seriously? On a slow Monday afternoon it takes longer than 40 minutes to get a salad out? When it finally came, I had to scarf it down since I needed to leave at 3:00. I got more than half way through it before I noticed that the avocado was left out. I couldn't find our waitress to say anything, so I ate it and left my husband there to pay the tab.  The service was slow. The food took much too long. And when it did come, it wasn't even made correctly. Time after time that I've been there, the food has sucked and the service has been mediocre. I cannot for the life of me understand why my friends like this place and keep suggesting we go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=60

Sarah J.,"San Antonio, TX",96,247,213,2.0,1/2/2017,"5 years ago, I loved BJ's. It was a frequent hangout spot for brews (Love that they have Hoegaarden on tap, and a similar citrus wheat bear of their own!) and flatbread pizza or apps with friends, and I almost always sat at the high top bar tables. My husband and I even went on our first date at BJ's back then.  Unfortunately, as the restaurant has settled into its prime, frequently busy Alamo Ranch location, everything has gone down hill. Not just the service, not just the food...everything. It's awful to watch a fun spot decline like this!! We've known this for awhile, but a few days ago one of our couple friends wanted to have dinner-date night there, so we gave it another shot. I got excited when we walked in because the hostess was extremely friendly. As soon as we sat down, the tone changed. We asked for a table for 5 and a high chair when we were seated, and the table they gave us was a booth. When we reminded our waitress about the high chair, she said she wasn't allowed to put it at that table. Fine; understandable. However, the 5th adult in our party wasn't there yet and we let him know not to come because there wasn't enough room at the table. The rest of the restaurant looked to busy to move spots. One meal down for the waitress (and her tip.)  We ordered and there was a whole issue amongst our party over the beers offered. My husband just wanted a Bud Light or Budweiser, but none on tap. He ordered one of their supposedly similar house brews to try it, but it tasted terrible (and nothing like Budweiser so I don't know why the waitress pointed it out.) Okay. The couple we were with went back and forth with the waitress about the correct way a Black & Tan vs. a Snakebite should be made. Now they may have been wrong - I'm no beer officianado - but the waitress arguing with them was really not acceptable either. A few beers down for the waitress (so of course a lower bill to follow.) Food was an issue in itself that the manager actually did attempt to handle, and did a decent job. The kitchen brought out our meals but they had burned my husband's Root Beer Ribs, so the FoH Manager came to apologize and promised they would be out soon. Soon wasn't exactly the case though, they came out just under 20 minutes later after the rest of us had almost finished our food. However, the manager DID comp them from the bill. Another meal down for the waitress, though we made up for the $10 in tip because we don't like to take things for free; that's certainly not why I use Yelp. The small plate of fried asparagus was chewy and took strength to bite through. My avocado spring rolls were as delicious as I remember them. Drink refills were few and far between, but the waitress also looked very busy.  Overall, with the drink and food issues, and the waitress's terrible attitude and rudeness, I doubt we'll be back anytime soon. The one thing keeping BJ's from getting a 1 star review from me is the manager's attempt to at least appease his customers, and his attentiveness to the floor when it was necessary. It seems like since he's providing so much help, the wait staff could try a little harder to work with him!! My Yelp rating system: 5 stars= Add this to your bucket list! 4 stars= I would recommend visiting. 3 stars= Average, acceptable, positive. 2 stars= You might be able to drag me in.  1 star= I will definitely not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=20

Just a little bit of advice. THE STEAKS. My mom ordered a steak rare. First it came out well done and then medium well. So avoid the steaks if you like them juicy. If you like them done and dry then you're in luck! BJs is ur place!!!  That was the only issue and we did not feel it warranted losing a star. After all, it's a brew house, not a steak house.

Hubby and I ordered the deep dish bacon ranch pizza with no onion and the berry cobbler for dessert. The 14'' pizza is a good size and thickness, more than enough for two people to share. The crust taste very similar to a pan Pizza Hut crust but less greasy. I am from the south not Southwest and we love cobbler. I have to say I was impressed by theirs!

You can also do call ahead seating from this app and pay for your meal. If you pay with the app you get five bucks off your meal. It is pretty neat I have never seen a rewards app like it. Each dollar you spend is worth one point and your points are used towards free food or money off your bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=80

When I sat down, she started to say that tonight they were running low on....silverware.  I looked at her and she said that they were low on silverware so it was going to be a few minutes until she had some for me.  I looked at her and said ""I expected to hear some sort of food you are out of, not silverware"" and laughed.  She responded that they had a lot of big parties that night which is why.  (Again restaurant half empty). My dirty martini was served without olives - when I ate my last bit of Pizza another waiter came along and asked if he could take my Parmesan cheese and pepper shakers for another table.   I was left wondering if the place was under bad management or experiencing financialy problems.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=80

Charity P.,"San Antonio, TX",0,16,,3.0,5/29/2016,"Food is good. Huge menu with lots of choices. We went there on a Sunday afternoon with no wait but I know from experience that any given Friday or Saturday night will have you waiting from an hour to an hour and a half.  I got the Sriracha queso and chips and my husband got the mozzarella sticks. Both were really good. Our margaritas were a bit sour but the food was so great we really didn't care . I do have a problem with the call ahead policy. Really, if a restaurant isn't going to take reservations then they shouldn't even bother. Basically if you call them and tell them you're coming and ask to put your name on the list when you show up you will be handed a pager and you are put at the end of line. It does absolutely nothing so don't try to call ahead just go. Here is my biggest gripe: THIS PLACE IS EXPENSIVE. And I say that because what you are getting is burgers, pizza, pasta ... We noticed that many of the appetizers were just as, if not more expensive than the main courses. And seriously $9 for a 12 oz margarita? It wasn't even top shelf and tasted like sour mix. I could go across the street and get a huge fishbowl margarita with a beer in it for the same price.  I probably won't be eating here anytime soon except for a special occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=80

Even though it is a bit expensive we would go here about once a month. In the past several visits we have been noting a decline in the food quality. Service is good, but the food is just not worth the cost. We ordered calamari for an appetizer and it was ALL tentacles and clumped together and much too chewy. Next came the chicken tortilla soup...with NO chicken. I sent it back and when the bowl was returned they had simply thrown in a few pieces of grilled chicken. Then they brought the bowl back to me and no big surprise the soup was now cold. Now finally the Flatbread arrives. The flavor was okay but the crust was soggy. We have decided that a cookie desert is not worth it. We won't be going there again anytime soon.

Wide range on their menu, never had anything we didn't like. Adding on, chose to do an 'edit' vs. an 'update'. I'm keeping them at 4 stars.  Mini pizzas are perfect if you have a group & want to try a few different ones. During happy hour they are $6 and there's no limit on how many you can order. Appetizers are large portions and are also half off during HH.   Sometimes beer can be out due to them being seasonal or made in-house however there are plenty of choices if you need a back up.  Try their cream sodas, they are made in-house & are so dreamy.   It's our local 'drinking hole' and we're here maybe once a week or every other week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=80

Daniel W.,"San Antonio, TX",29,122,137,2.0,10/6/2015,"Came here yesterday with the pops for a quick lunch and were quickly seated. Given menus and time to order. We decided on spinach artichoke dip, raviolis, and a deep dish pizza. Our waitress was friendly and prompt bringing out drinks and refills, while the bjs team was quick to bring out our dip. The artichoke dip wasn't bad, wasn't amazing, but could have been better with maybe some bread instead of the tortilla chips that are provided. Our entrees came out quickly and I asked for one of they're specialty root beers with my meal. Unfortunately for me, it wasn't working, so I had to settle for a cream soda, and was ever so disappointed. Onto the food, the raviolis were more like a lasagna bake that was not good. Too much cheese to cover up too little flavor, however the garlic bread was delicious, maybe they should have used these for the dip? On to my deep dish pizza, it was kinda warm, but not hot, eerie because it supposedly just came out of the oven?? It was also not bad, but will not be ordered again by me. I like their regular crust pizza better.

The photo on the menu was why we ordered it. The portion and the presentation were sub standard to the pic. So here's the funny part, the manager takes a couple of wasted moments trying to justify the portion was the same as the pic. Not so.  Just for the record, the portion wasn't that bad it just wasn't close to the picture on the menu.  So I, with a smile, say ""just change the menu out to your new plate arrangement to match pic to what you serve"". I get back from her, ""do you know how much it costs to change our menus out?""

Jade M.,"San Antonio, TX",204,645,1576,4.0,9/10/2014,"I'm definitely a fan of BJ's. Almost everything that I have tried I have enjoyed. My favorites are the Atlantic salmon with rice pilaf and steamed veggies, the California Club sandwich, the Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread, the Mediterranean tacos, and the traditional wings appetizer. My parents are big fans of their Piranha Pale Ale Chili and the gluten free thin crust pizza, and my boyfriend likes their New Orleans Jambalaya and the Crispy Jalapeno burger. The food is pretty consistent and each time that I have had a problem the manager has fixed it right away. The first time was for a to-go order - I had ordered a ribeye steak and when we brought it home it was heavily seasoned and tasted of pure salt. The manager offered to make a new one, refund us our money or leave us a gift card for what we spent. I opted to have a new one and the replacement steak was perfect. The second time was on a visit this past weekend. I wanted to try something new so I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos. As soon as I picked one up I noticed that it was cold, so I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be served that way (kind of like sushi or ceviche) but she said it wasn't and took it back right away. The manager stopped by our table and offered me a soup or salad while I waited for new tacos. I tried the wedge salad (excellent!) and then the shrimp tacos that came out were amazing!! The flavors were great and the shrimp were nice and warm. I would definitely order that again. Also, if you sign up for their free rewards program you collect points for every dollar you spend. Since my family eats here quite a bit, it's nice to be rewarded for our loyalty. There are different items that you can claim (free pizookie or $5 or $10 off your meal, but we always save up our points for the $25 off a meal - it's like getting a whole meal for free!).

Greg T.,"San Antonio, TX",1,10,16,3.0,1/18/2015,"The food was delicious, and the server did a good job. But everything else under par.  We got there just before 5:30 PM on a Saturday night.  I gave the hostess my reward card number and waited for our party of 5 to be seated. Another party of 5 came in about 5 minutes after us. They requested a booth and 2 kid menus, I requested a table.  Somehow, our tickets got switched; they were seated before us as were about 5 other parties that arrived after us.  We were finally escorted to a booth, the host had 2 kid menus in hand. I informed the host that our tables had been switched and the other party was sitting at the table I reauested.  By this time, the resturant was packed so the manager at us at the bar, he pushed 3 small high tables to accomadate our party. Other than the 20 minute delay to finally be seated, the seating was fine.  We ordered a couple of beer samplers, and began to look at the menus.  The waitress accidently knocked over one of the small empty glasses and it shattered. Shards of glass went everywhere with majority of the broken glass landing in my friends lap. The server quickly cleaned up the area and apologized.  Accidents happen, and the waitress handled it like a pro.  When our food finally arrived, my daughter's dish was garnished with a wilted piece of lettuce that had began to turn to black.  My New Orleans Jambalaya was coated in cayenne pepper to the point that the dish was inedible.  You could smell the spice from 3 feet away. I sent the dish back and by the time the replacement dish arrived the rest of the party had already finished their meals. In the end the food was delicious and the server did a fine job, but overall the attention to detail was lacking. When I paid my bill I noticed that I was not credited with my reward points and I had to go back to the server to have them added.  This little error was a result of the other party being given my table in the beginning.  I noticed that tables seated around us had also sent dishes back.  It was a very crowded Saturday night and it seemed like the restaurant was simply understaffed.  Overall a good meal, just a bunch of little details that brought the experience down a couple of notches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=140

Charles B.,"Houston, TX",7,53,17,2.0,4/10/2012,"Hey BJ's, serving 4 out of 5 people passable food won't get you four out of five stars.  1.5 stars for you, but I'll round to 2. Our family and a friend had dinner at BJ's.  A medium pizza for two, a burger, a bread bowl soup, and pasta.  The first four were OK, but my daughter's pasta was unbelievably bad.  The flat fettuccine noodles were stuck together, sometimes as many as four thick.  It appears somebody dumped them in the pot to boil and never stirred. The waitress was very apologetic and got the manager.  He offered to remake the food, but said it would be awhile to make the pasta.  By the time he came over, the rest of us were almost through.  We explained we were trying to catch a movie and didn't have that kind of time to wait.  Rather than offering us something else, he simply said he would take the item off and left.  He was not very apologetic and not even too disturbed that half the pasta was stuck together and hard. (And, no, it wasn't possible to find the half good pasta among the hard and stuck together pieces.)  My daughter shared the remaining portions of the other entrees.  Yes, he took the item off, but he ruined everybody's experience. The thick crust pizza was very doughy also and sub-par.  Kennedy's Chicago Pizza a couple of miles away is way better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=140
Dolph M.,"San Antonio, TX",19,305,360,4.0,4/19/2010,"Brand new location! All our food was great, and the atmosphere is very cool. However, I think they roll the cost of the atmosphere into the menu prices. As good as everything was, I can't say there's much value to find at BJ's. However, the BBQ chicken pizza was particularly notable. Most BBQ pizzas tend to be soaking in sweet barbecue sauce overpowering any other flavors... BJ's manages to balance both traditional pizza flavors and BBQ flavors in such a way that it still tastes like a pizza, instead of an open-face barbecue sandwich. Excellent recipe!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=140

Heather J.,"San Antonio, TX",15,87,16,4.0,11/9/2012,"My husband and I had gone to BJ's by ourselves for lunch and dinner, all of which we enjoyed.  The portions are a respectable size and they have a wide range of options.  I don't tend to like huge menus, but a large part of theirs is due to pizza and burger options.   Our most recent experience was actually when we held a surprise party for my Grandmother's 80th birthday.  We had a dozen family members coming from all over and needed a place to surprise her.  Unfortunately, most places with private rooms charge way more than we had in our budget and require larger groups.   While the Alamo Ranch BJ's doesn't have a private room, they do have a back section that is partially partitioned and they could take our group of 12 people.  You just call ahead and ask to make a group reservation, with the only fee being the automatic 15% or so (it might be 17-8%, I can't remember sadly) gratuity added onto your bill.  Then all you have to do is show up at the time you reserved and everyone can order off of the regular menu - they even will let you split the check! Another benefit was that we were allowed to bring our own cake and ice cream, which our waiter brought out when we asked at the end of the meal.  Service was only slightly slower than when we had come as a couple, but this is not unexpected since a larger party simply takes longer to deal with.  All in all it was a wonderful meal and worked well for our family since we were only a mid sized group and preferred to split the check among ourselves.   If you need a casual place to take a larger group or just want to go for an individual meal, I would definitely recommend BJ's Brewhouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=140

Now its 2 dollars off appetizers and only $1 dollar off during happy hours. They are falling short and very expensive! We also noticed during there happy hour that they give smaller portions, so when you are suppose to save $2 dollars off of there $10 appetizers they give your smaller portions. so you don't really get a good deal at all!!!!!!!!!!

Roberto L.,"San Antonio, TX",16,65,28,2.0,3/13/2012,"We went here to eat as a family. It was actually one of the first places we ate out when moving to San Antonio, so I was excited with it being a ""brewhouse"" and all! This review is weighted on the name having ""brewhouse"" in it, so while the food was OK, the other factors pull it down. Food (3 Stars) ------------------- I got a burger, can't really mess those up. In order to ensure that, I ordered an open face burger. It was pretty good. My wife ordered off the specials list and she was happy with her meal as well! I would give the burger and fries and meal an overall 3. Beer (2 Stars) -------------------- I ordered the American Ale. I don't know if the fault is on me, the restaurant or the server. The real answer might be ""yes"". When I read the description on the menu, I was expecting a nice darker ""Budweiser American Ale"" style beer to come out. When the light colored beer came out, I looked at my wife and said ""uh-oh"". It was an IPA, there is no other way to describe it. The menu should have read ""American Ale: It's an IPA.""  Service (2 Stars) ----------------------- This is where things kind of pulled the experience down for me. I sipped the beer and then it sat there for the rest of the meal (I hate IPAs). The waitress finally asked about the beer and I told her I thought it was more of an IPA and that the menu didn't really describe it right. She said ""yeah. that's true, I mean it is more like an IPA"". She then walked away.  Overall, we have eaten around this place a few times, but never gone back. I wanted to like it. I wanted to like it hard, but it made it really hard. I have experienced better and would rather try different places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=140

Tamara N.,"San Antonio, TX",107,116,188,3.0,10/30/2013,"We have been to this establishment a couple of times since moving to this side of town and have been satisfied. The staff is very friendly and eager to recommend items from the menu, to include the vast variety of beers. My husband and I went for an early dinner a few days ago and ordered the Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo. It was so big, we took half of it home. It really is enough to feed four people. It includes Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls. The Spinach & Artichoke Dip was probably the best version that I have ever had. It was so good that it will probably be our default appetizer from now on. My husband really liked the Santa Fe Spring Rolls as well. The Avocado Egg Rolls are good and the dipping sauce is great but we had to add salt because they were very bland. We ordered the BJ's Favorite Pizza the first time we went and it was very very good. We had the BJ's Classic Combo this time and we did not enjoy it as much as we did the first one. I had a Caesar Salad on our first visit and it was very good as well. My husband tried the Pumpkin Ale and fell in love with it. I didn't care for the spices in my beer, it was weird to me.  The BJ's Handcrafted Root Beer is the best Root Beer.

I've only ever sat at the bar or a table in that area (easier access to drink refills... ya know?), therefore I cannot speak for the service elsewhere. The food is consistent, and it's on the top of my ""chain restaurants that I'll eat at"" list. Their beer is also quite good, the IPA, blonde, and lightswitch lager are all pretty good beers. They have a decent variety on tap as well if you're not feeling like trying theirs. Magic Hat #9 is always my go-to. Mixed drinks are not too shabby, but I rarely dabble in those. I like their small plates ($2.95-$4.95) because they're not too much before your meal, but the apps are tasty, too...Thai shrimp lettuce wraps and avocado rolls are my favs. I get the pizza most often. I used to love their buffalo chicken pizza, thin crust or deep dish. This is the only place I've seen celery put on the pizza, and it's the perfect touch. New menu items recently, really enjoyed their brussel sprouts/kale salad with berries. Also, clam chowder is very good for being at a chain and nowhere near New England.

They do have a pretty decent draft beer selection and their menu is extensive but over all the most I can give them is 3 stars. There just aren't that many places to choose from on the far west side of town for casual/bar dining so we reluctantly go here more times than we would if we had a choice.

As my colleagues and I happened upon the new BJ's for an after work let's get the weekend started affair, we needed a table for 12 to accommodate us in our frivolity. While waiting we took advantage of the discounts afforded those who arrive after 9 for the reverse happy hour which include $1 off drafts, $2 off apps and half off mini pizzas.  Those specials do not, however, transfer into the main dining room once you are seated.  What!?!  Your name is BJ's Brewhouse! You have the name brewhouse in your title. You make your own beer. You celebrate the artisanal craftsmanship necessary to create and deliver such a fine hand crafted beverage with murals lining the walls depicting the harvest. In other words:  ""There is no place where beer ends and food begins.""  You are a bar!  Freetail does not exclude it's patrons seated near the exit door from the nights specials nor does Blue Star nor Flying Saucer. BJ's how can you justify such behavior?  Well apparently the misconception that they are a bar is readily amended when anything other than those items drawn from a tap are requested. All night I saw the most disgusting variations of such simple things as a Mojito, an Amaretto sour, or a Margarita. At one point some members of our table ordered a shooter unfamiliar to the bartenders who replaced it with a recommendation of something that resembled a glass of orange Tang.  What the hell behind the bar can you put in a drink that makes it orange?  Judging from the puckered up faces of the participants it did not, unfortunately, taste as good as a glass of Tang.

(Alamo Ranch location )  Today is my stepdaughters 13th bday, she chose BJ's to have dinner at (on a Monday night.)  So I call around 2pm, to ask if we can make reservations for 6pm for a party of 11.  I was told by Mercedes that, no, I shouldve called 24 hours in advance and they wont take my reservation.  I asked really, you cant take the reservation now for a Monday evening? and she replies - nope.  I then told her, I guess I should just go to another restaurant, to which she replies, ok, thank you , goodbye.  RUDE.  I normally would have just gone to another place, however my stepdaughter really wanted to eat here.  So with that said, I called back and spoke to a manager - Mike, who apologized for the previous girls behavior and said they would love to have us if we are still willing to come.  So our reservation was made. 6pm comes,.. our party of 11 is seated.  Our waitress is Breanna.  In taking our orders, Breanna is a tad bit condescending and rude and not very personable.  My father asks if both the wedge fries and skinny fries are seasonsed and she says - No, just the wedges, in a tone which reeks of speaking to a 5 year old.  Then my 4 yr old son order burgers & applesauce, hes the only one who didnt get his meal when the entire rest of the table got theirs.  I asked her where his food was, she stated she would check on it and let me know.  She then proceeds to take another tables order, log it in the system (5 minutes has passed) and then I had to go up to her to ask her again.  Again, she states she will check on it and let me know.  She then comes back (everyone else is 3/4 of the way done with their meal, and my husband is feeding our son his burger) and says the kitchen dropped it on the floor on  the way out and they are having to recook them.  Which I think is a load of crap.  I think they forgot the order to begin with and were trying to buy time. Needless to say, we should have chosen another place for her birthday.  Poor service from start to finish.  Waste of our money for the food and service we got.   Eat somewhere else, you'll be happier you did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=180

Kind of enjoyed sitting by the heaters - especially since it's the holiday season.  Our server was great - personable, attentive, although a little forgetful, but still overall pleasant.  Food choice was overwhelming, but that's a good thing. I went for the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was a great choice. Nice light flavor. Mashed potatoes had great flavor. Broccoli was cooked just right.  Nice night out with friends. I would definitely go there again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=180

During peak hours I would definately call ahead and get a reservation as I have seen people wait for an hour for a table. I have had a few sandwiches but I typically eat the pizza.  I'm not a deep dish fan so I ask for it to be on a flat bread - yummy and not so much bread.  They also have a great spinach and artichoke dip - you can really taste the parmasean.  I had for the first time one of their salads - the itailian - and it was delish and huge.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=180

Mike C.,"Helotes, TX",36,4,8,2.0,6/20/2010,"First of all, my rating is low because of the overall experience.  I believe that BJ's has the potential to be a great place to hang out and drink some great micro-brew beers, but not the best place to actually sit down and eat.  This was my first attempt to visit BJ's, and I hope that my problems were growing pains of a busy newly opened restaurant.   We arrived around 6pm and were seated in around 15 minutes, which was pretty good considering how packed the place was.  We sat down and promptly looked over the 12 page menu.  The food selection is huge, but they seem to highlight the beer menu in the very front which has a rainbow of custom brewed beers.  I ordered their Imperial Stout, which actually was on of the best I have had.  Then the appetizer came.  We ordered the Avocado egg rolls, which looked delicious on the menu and the waitress gave them raving reviews.  They were perfectly fried egg rolls with a large lump of warm Avocado, with a couple subtle seasonings.  Biting into the outer shell of the egg roll was crispy and delicious until the warm avocado squirts into your mouth like you just bit into a giant bug(not that I have eaten a giant bug, but that is what I was imagining).  I could have gotten past the texture if there had been even a hint of flavor to make up for it, but I was very disappointed.  The dipping sauce was excellent and was sweet with a bit of zing, but they only served us enough sauce for about 1 of the egg rolls. After the appetizer was over, I was ready for my main course, a medium New York Strip steak.  The waiter drops my food by and asks me to check my steak and then runs off.  I checked the steak and it was cooked to the point that it was like chewing on leather.  I waited around 10 minutes for the waitress to return to send it back.  She took my steak and said she would bring the manager by.  The manager never showed up.  Right as my wife was finishing up her meal my steak arrived.  Luckily they had done it right this time.  I was so upset by then that it was difficult to enjoy.  I wouldn't call it a great steak, but my second steak was cooked correctly.  I will give BJ's a second chance in a few months, but only for beers and appetizers. To summarize, if you are looking for good food and service, go down the street to Red Robin and only come to BJ's if you are looking for some good craft beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=200

These things happen, but everyone is due for an off-day once in a while. I'm just a little more easy going when it comes to restaurants and that's why I enjoy it here; I don't have high expectations. We came here yesterday for a beer and a snack. We ordered a couple pints (their Oktoberfest and Hopstorm IPA) and shared a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It was awesome! Granted the pizza wasn't mind-blowing but it's a chain restaurant/brewpub, what do people expect?

Amanda B.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,96,25,1.0,9/28/2011,"BJ's is so great. Unfortunately this is the WORST location in San Antonio: 100% due to the manager. I believe he was the assistant or day manager, or some other title for a little boy wearing big boy shoes he found for a minute. The wait staff and food was amazing. I will update as soon as I find the card with names I wrote down. Long story short: Was with a large group for a birthday. Was kicked out (twice) by this tool because he ""needed the tables for another reservation."" To my knowledge, BJ's doesn't take reservations? We had a large group of professional adults, including a few medical doctors (just a point for ability to take on large bill.) We complained to the server, acknowledging it was obviously not their fault. Douchebag's supervisor came out apologized said there is no way it is acceptable.  D-bag came back out, said supervisor talker to him and he ""guessed"" he could have handled it better... Cute apology. We did not want anything for free because that was not the point of the complaint, we made that known. Everyone but the tool trying to prove himself got that. The ""reservation"" showed up, smaller than our group, bunch of trash bags, 50% kids... After a good laugh we ventured to another location and continued to spend a few more hundred dollars. Food and service is always great, but this manager is a clown. Once I find my note I will edit my review...  Upside: Apparently this is this only BJ's in the country that takes reservations for six losers wearing clearanced Ed Hardy and six toddlers, because that is how a restaurant makes money.

I can't really ""rave"" about the food because its just a standard mix I describe as ""upscale bar & grill"" kind of food that you would find at similar corporate themed restaurants. I mean the food is good overall. Nothing to rave about. But they do have a great beer selection.  I like BJs for Happy Hour because they have good discounts on drinks & appetizers at the bar and there is usually an interesting mix of people. They also a ""reverse happy hour"" for later at night. And they serve Boddingtons on tap, which makes me very happy.  The bar staff is very professional and personable. They seem to recognize & greet regular customers and they always make me feel welcome. They are also very attentive to service no matter how busy it gets and they will usually engage in some good bar banter. This kind of personable service seems to be working in developing lots of regular bar customers there and I like that. The service and staff and management are excellent. One time for lunch, I had a minor concern with my food and the manager was all over it to correct the issue and to ensure everything was taken care of. (That kind of ""hands on"" service oriented management style adds an extra star to my rating of this place.) While the food is pretty good overall, the pizzas are excellent. They have good deep dish Chicago style pizzas, and also little mini pizzas like at CPK. But the nachos, however, are horrible. I mean horrible. They serve them like a big mound of chips on a big plate with a little bit of cheese and toppings. But just below that top layer is nothing but a mound of dry chips with some bland chili on the plate. Not good at all. I like BJs overall.

The tuna was fleshy in a very good way and had a gingery, but flavorful taste. The wasabi gave it that punch that you would expect to add to a good piece of raw fish. For our meal, we went off of a suggestion from our waiter. We got the California pizza. Made with chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado. This pizza was delicious. The crust was really nicely done. This was a winner. The other dish we ate was the Cuban burger. It is a half-pound burger served sandwich-style, topped with oven-roasted ham, Swiss cheese, crispy dill pickles, Dijonnaise and mustard. This burger was very good, but mine came a little overcooked. There was some char on half of the patty that I normally will deal with, but the burnt taste took away from the burger. The other half was fine and I enjoyed every last bite of it. BJ's is a great place to take groups of people to eat because I have no doubt that they have something on the menu for all types of taste buds. I gave it 3 stars for the burnt half of a patty, but I will be sure to try it again and update my rating if it changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=160

I tend to visit quite a bit and sit at the bar and find their customer service and food are pretty top notch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=160
Sheryl G.,"San Francisco, CA",184,350,935,4.0,9/20/2011,Love their lunch special unlimited soup & salad. Fave is the tomato bisque with the capese salad. If I want something light go for their mini bites menu: usually get their barbacoa steak tacos followed with the bruchetta. Finish with a small pazookie topped with vanilla ice cream. Last time I went there they had a red velvet one with white chocolate chips and it was heaven on a spoon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=160

Natalie R.,"San Antonio, TX",0,15,9,3.0,10/26/2013,"Sigh.. Idk..  First time here was good, their grilled chicken sandwich is really good.. The ahi tuna appetizer was fresh and delicious.. This time meh.. Service started off good then went down.  My chicken fried steak was bland, Caesar salad was all iceberg lettuce and too much dressing.  My boyfriend had the pot roast sandwich which tasted amazing!!! His tortilla soup was soo delish and I love the way they serve it!! Pizookie was good too! Overall my meal sucked and his was on point lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=160

Cindy A.,"San Antonio, TX",4,11,12,5.0,1/15/2013,"Love this place! Went for the first time this past weekend with my honey to watch some NFL. Their beer pints were a bit pricey, but they do have an amazing food menu. So many items to choose from. We ended up ordering the new beginnings appetizer plate which runs around $16. Luckily they had happy hour during NFL games so all appetizers were half off. Score.. lol but, I wouldn't mind paying full price. It was definitely worth it; filling and tasty. We couldn't even finish it. Our server was also awesome and on top of everything. Great job. I will definitely be going back to BJs. I loved it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=160
Erica V.,"San Antonio, TX",6,21,,2.0,6/17/2010,"I know I have been accused of being a restaurant snob and now I may have to agree.  This was a terrible experience. I don't know if our waitress had short term memory or what her problem was, but she introduced herself to us about four times and couldn't remember what we were drinking. Pepsi is difficult to remember when your in a bar-type restaurant I know.  The restaurant was not crowded as we went during the week and it was later in the evening. We were still not ""allowed"" to sit in a bigger booth (the 4 person size) because we were a party of 2. However after seating us, they sat two parties of 2 in the bigger booths. Hmmm  Ordered chips and salsa to start...salsa was wonderful, chips, I would have rather brought my own. To thick and almost stale tasting. I ordered a burger on sourdough with the wedge-cut fries. The other person ordered a chicken sandwich of some sort with the thin-cut fries. Our food was first brought to another table, then finally brought to us. The fries were nicely warm, not hot, but somewhat acceptable. The bread on my burger was not sourdough, but the garlic bread option. The bread tasted okay, but I was not in the mood for garlic bread, hence ordering the sourdough. The bread quickly became very soggy with all the 1000 Island Dressing they seem to own stock in since it is listed on the menu for almost everything. The burger meat itself was good. It had a nice texture and smelled great. It could have used seasoning, even just salt and pepper would have been good.  The chicken sandwich which appeared to not really be identifiable was okay. The thin-cut fries were the best thing in the entire meal. Pretty sad.  Our waitress seemed to only want to wait on the man at the table and never looked me in the eyes or even in my direction. She continually brought refills to the other person, but I had to wait until my glass was empty.  Atmosphere was okay, not to loud or to bright. I WILL NOT go back for food, including getting take out. I may (if I have a moment of weakness) go back to try the dessert.  Sadly, I would have preferred to waste my time eating a McDonald's Double Quarter pounder, large fries, and large Coke at home while watching TV instead of eating out. This is why I do not eat restaurants that I feel are on the same level as Chili's. I will take home from those restaurants, but I refuse to waste my valuable relaxing time having to fight with waitresses or deal with bad food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio-2?start=160
Bradford H.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,14,1,5.0,1/19/2013,"I think this place is 5 stars. Honestly, both take out & dine in service past the test. Good service. & even though this is a chain, it's one of the only in my top places I like to go when I'm in San Antonio. Great beer selection as well.
