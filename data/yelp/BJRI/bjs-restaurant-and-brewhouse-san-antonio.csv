Erica S.,"San Antonio, TX",60,172,438,4.0,8/15/2017,"Somehow I've never been to a BJ's before. I found this place looking on yelp for somewhere on my way home to get ahi poke (I was really craving it). I was really happy with my experience here - I sat at the bar during happy hour. The poke was so fresh and super quick to come out. It had a bunch of different veggies and a great poke sauce. I enjoyed it so much I ordered another togo for lunch the next day. Just under $11, I wish they would discount it a little on their happy hour. I also got a glass of wine that was on happy hour. It's a 7oz pour of Dark Horse for $5. Good deal. The bartender was attentive, quick and friendly to everyone. Just what you want when you're sitting at the bar. I'll definitely be back!  Bonus- they have a lot of lower calorie items on their menu that sound really good. Which is hard to find when dining out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio
Kenny P.,"San Antonio, TX",14,25,3,2.0,12/16/2017,"Ordered appetizers and asked to get the appetizer first before entrees. Received the appetizers about 10 minutes later, about 30 seconds before the entrees arrived. They took the entrees back and brought them back well after appetizers were gone. Looks like the food was thrown back in the oven to keep warm?. Everything was well done. Shrimp don't taste good well done. The menu picture of the shrimp, asparagus and penne plate showed about 9 pieces of penne pasta and several more shrimp. My plate arrived with 5 shrimp and boat load of penne pasta, 50 or 70?? People who are watching your carbs... don't order this over priced plate of mostly pasta.  The Arnold Palmer was great!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio

John S.,"Ventura, CA",63,457,132,4.0,12/30/2017,"I had the weekend special of the double bone-in pork chop and it was delicious and huge! No skimping around the weekend pork chop special! The wait staff was pretty darn good, the starters came out and the mains came out efficiently and with good timing. I usually like BJs for their happy hour specials and TVs but tonight's dinner with the family was excellent.

K H.,"San Antonio, TX",1,20,1,2.0,1/1/2018,First and last time we will visit this restaurant. We had a party of 7 and were seated right away. The table we were given was dirty and crumbs all over the seat - it had been wiped but not very well. Still had dry ketchup and other sticky smears on it. When we told the hostess she gave it a half hearted wipe down and said it was just the granite variations and gave us attitude.  The server was nice enough. Food took a long time to come even though the restaurant was half full. Tells me they don't staff the kitchen appropriately.  Burgers we ordered were good and the fries were really good. One of our party ordered a salad and had to send it back. Lettuce was very soggy and wilted. As if they put dressing on way before bringing it out. Flatbread pizza was not good as well. Crust was chewy instead of crispy that you would expect. Wings were good but unevenly coated in the sauce.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio
Tanya L.,"San Antonio, TX",189,60,184,5.0,7/19/2017,"I've been here twice and the food and service has impressed me both times, especially since it is a chain! I appreciate the smaller, trendier places to eat, but was pleasantly surprised with BJs. Im not a fan of the menu because it is enormous and I am indecisive but I wouldn't let that affect the stars since That's a personal problem  Lunch was the easiest time to go because the menus is smaller! I ordered the unlimited soup and salad and my friend got the shrimp cous cous - both choices were great!! I went another time and ordered the ahi tuna salad, also can't go wrong there   Make sure to check this place out and don't be intimidated by all the options!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio

Our server was attentive, amiable, and knowledgeable about all the specials. We already knew what we wanted and she put our order in really quickly.

Lesley S.,"San Antonio, TX",940,1200,1296,4.0,10/1/2016,"BJ's is a place I would frequent when I went to California. Now that I've moved to Texas I've been to the 3 near me as well as one in Austin. BJ's favorite deep dish is my go to pizza with its concoction of meats with olives, tomatoes, onion, bell peppers and mushrooms. I finish it off with their Jeremiah Red beer. BJ's has a large line of their own craft beer. Their Oktoberfest and Hefe is pretty good too.  I like the Nutty Brown if I'm just getting apps because I get way too full.  Other faves:  Watermelon and feta salad. This is I believe seasonal. I like it so much that I sometimes remake it at home however I don't have that honey vinaigrette down pat yet.  Crispy artichokes are by far my favorite app. Artichoke with a lemon is fireworks in your mouth. So much robust flavor  that you don't know what is going on.  Bad dish I've got? Ahi poke.... I actually got it at the other SA location and yes I know 3 years living in Hawaii you can't judge Texas poke. However I'm rating it against the few times I've had it in Texas and it was horrendous. A slab of chunked ahi with nothing on it. I know I'm not on Oahu anymore but places in Houston, Austin, and even Yard House make better poke.  Service is usually good.

Terri E.,"San Antonio, TX",94,119,37,3.0,5/4/2016,"My son and I just ate here today for the first time for lunch.  Was seated quickly, was not too crowded for lunch. People here and there.  I ordered the grill cheese sandwich and tomato soup. My son ordered their bison burger which he enjoyed. The tomato soup came out before my sandwich. I was expecting it to come out with my grilled cheese. When I mentioned it to the waiter he said oh sorry. That's it. (the proper thing for him to have done is brought out another hot soup with the sandwich) I don't know about you but, I like to eat my grilled cheese sandwich with the tomato soup and not as a appetizer.  We waited quite a while for our meals. My grilled cheese was not hot. It was warm same with the fries. I mentioned to the waiter and he said he could reheat it but, I never send any food back in fear of someone doing something to it in the back. So I ate half of the sandwich and gave the other half to my son.  I feel they are quite pricey for what you get. The Pizzas are super expensive and that is what the waiter said is their signature dish.  Not sure if I will go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio

Bob T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,16,3,2.0,12/8/2017,First let me say I have been a fan of this place with no less than bi weekly visits for the last 5 years. I love the waitstaff there they make the place work. That being said the last few visits will be my last due to the fact that they are misrepresenting there value . The happy hour specials are smoking mirrors I ordered there JN burger what the fail to tell you is that the burger on the happy our is 1/2 the patty you get when you order it on the regular menu I brought that to their attention also the sliders are a patty cut in 1/4 that's not a true slider . It side be 4 -2 oz patties again smoking mirrors. In short if your going to offer happy hour specials don't advertise at the normal menu items for a better price then cut back on the portions that is misleading the customers. By the way when I brought this up the manager never even came to the table . To many other places to get treated better especially after being a loyal customer for years,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio

Steve B.,"Spring Branch, TX",304,264,593,4.0,12/3/2015,"It's funny, but  BJ's has become a tradition for my brother and me to buy each other's birthday lunch.  It's one of our few times to get together without wives or kids:) This time, there was a large crowd waiting to get in.  We got in line, and it moved fast - probably about 15 minute wait.  We followed our hostess to the table and were immediately met by our waitress.  She had a very bubbly personality, and when she heard it was my brother's birthday, said she had something special for him (dessert). My brother, being the healthy eater in the family, always gets a salad (and it is a large one).  I go for the French dip sandwich.  Food was delivered quickly and was very tasty and pleasing to the eye. The waitress kept coming by to check on our progress.  I think she was really seeing when it was time to bring him his dessert.  She kept our glasses filled the entire time, and we never wanted for anything. She finally saw we were finished and brought his dessert.  Of course, my brother wanted to share with me, but I said it was all his. Will we return.  For sure.  I may have to start going for something besides our birthdays as it was good food and is easy for us to get to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio
Diane M.,"TX, TX",0,3,3,1.0,8/17/2017,"I was here with my husband and our party after our wedding a while back and was terrified to come back after a very disgusting problem with their sourdough bread bowl/soup combo. While I was about to finally finish my ""meal"" (I adored this meal a lot and go there for it!) I noticed dark green mold under my bread and reported to the waiter. The waiter was very unmoved when I told her about the mold- she assumed it was dye until she brought it to the kitchen then the manager who was slightly defensive about how ""this never happens""- eventually  paid for our food.  I'm fine with what happened and it was all sorted out. But by how large the mold under the bread made me feel nervous on how long the other breads been there. It's been months and my whole group of party members are aware when they saw it. It will be a while till I come here.

This is one of our default go to places (We are members of their rewards club) when we want to go out for something above a sports bar. Their beer selection is pretty good (not a Yard House by any means) but a nice variety. I especially like their flat bread 'entrées and their take on spring rolls. Their pizza is pretty good, certainly not a Grimaldi's or Dough category but not bad, especially if you are watching a game with a good draft. We were there about a week ago and I had the tortilla soup which didn't set well, but that may have been me. My wife that evening had the clam chowder in the bread bowl and that was great.

Daryl Y.,"San Antonio, TX",70,70,5,5.0,8/11/2016,"This review is more about an employee than the food.    While the food was solid and nobody was left wanting more, the service was Great!!!   Zach took great care of us!!!  His attentiveness and awareness is hard to find today in my opinion.  The fact that my 21 year old son mentioned that was the first time he had ever felt like tipping the server with his own money is a big deal.    Here is the story. My son is profoundly deaf and while far from a disability at times people have a hard time figuring out how to communicate with him or even relate to him for that matter.   At some point during our dinner I guess Zach saw my son looking over his shoulder to watch USA basketball.   Zach took it upon himself to change the TV nearest to us, swinging by casually, tapping my son on the shoulder and pointing at that TV.  All without my awareness or need to translate.   While a little thing - the effort to make that change on the fly and not making a big deal of it meant a great deal to my son!!!    Thank You Zach for your attentiveness and awareness!!!      D.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=20
Kay J.,"San Antonio, TX",570,281,658,5.0,1/19/2016,"We frequent BJ's at least once per month.  The homemade root beer is delicious and not too sweet, the beer selection is vast.  Appetizers are great (favorites: Fried artichokes and chips and salsa), the variety of menu items=huge (favorites: cheeseburger, flatbread pizzas, chicken tacos and crusted Parmesan chicken)!  You definitely need time to ponder over the menu. One thing you don't want to miss is the deep dish pizza!  It's flavorful, thick and loaded! And..... For dessert (you HAVE to save room) - Pizookies!!! A warm soft cookie baked in a tin pan with a heap of ice cream and whipped cream on top (Oreo- my FAV).  ** I'm very allergic to avocado and once they accidentally put it on my sandwich anyway. When I brought it to their attention, they quickly took my sandwich away. The manager came over and apologized profusely.

And every time our waiter left to get us something, he was gone another 15 minutes. Either they were seriously understaffed for lunch, or he was badly trained.

Brian K.,"San Antonio, TX",1,43,,5.0,4/22/2017,"BJ's has a LOT going on.  Ridiculous menu, full of stuff, just an absolutely insane amount of choices.  I would hate to be a cook there. I really like their wedge salad, it's crazy creamy bleu cheese goodness.  The pizookies are a ridiculously rich dessert, and very good. Their clam chowder is hearty and good, their other soups are not good, they could definitely use a soup makeover.  Caesar salad is good.  Ribs are good, but of course I recommend going on Thursdays for the Rib specials where they are significantly cheaper.  Service is usually on point.  Prices are okay, but if you are able to take advantages of their M-F specials, or lunch specials you will get more bang for your buck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=20

E. F.,"Bonsall, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/19/2016,"I ate here with a large group, 25+ people. When the staff set up the tables into 1 very long one, they put our party against the wall. The table was so close to the wall that when you were scooted up to the table the back of the chairs still touched the wall. There was no room to maneuver out to get to the restrooms etc. For those of us sitting against the wall it was a solid 5 degrees warmer and uncomfortable. One person in our party is Gluten-free by necessity, not choice. They requested a Gluten Free menu upon entering the restaurant and was told they had to go find one. This never received it and had to look up the GF menu online on a phone, only to see that BJ's Gluten Free options are very few . . . 2 steaks, a few salads and GF pizza. As we were ordering, we were told that one of the pizza ovens was out. Later we found out they were down 2 cooks as well. Our food took forever to come out. Our party had many children. One of the waiters was taking food orders directly from children, not 10 or 12 year olds. She took food orders from 3, 5, and 7 year olds without consulting the parents. The parents had already ordered a pizza for their kids to share, to make dinner not so expensive. The parents ordered the pizza with one waiter, while the waitress took the kids' order without checking with the parents. When the food came out there was a pizza and 3 kids meals, and some upset parents.  All the kids' food came out middle to last of all the orders and missing their sides. My daughter had not been served all her food by the time I finished my meal. Two of the 3 steaks arrived at the table well done rather than medium rare as they had ordered. I ordered a steak and potato and although my steak was cooked properly (unlike the other 2) it was one of the most flavorless cuts of beef I have ever eaten. My husband ordered a burger and found it to be mediocre.  Menus were not removed from the table. Our table was not bussed when plates emptied. Friends in our party had to move the plates to another table so that we had room on the table, or so that empty plates would not fall off the stacks of menus in the middle of the table.

Waitress came over to check on us and we told her the steak was undercooked and we were waiting on it to come back. Split the chicken entree while awaiting the steak. Steak never came out. Waitress came to check on us  again and we asked how long for the steak as it had been well over 15 minutes and we were done with the other entree. She checked and came back and said it would be a few minutes. Manager then comes out and says, sorry I dont know what happened but here is your steak. He cut into it and it was more undercooked than the original. I said to forget it and we will pay for the chicken but not the steak. Another server brought us the bill and the manager comped the steak and half the chicken. The issues isnt the mistakes but that no one seemed to care.

I am not a huge beer drinker but decided thats what I wanted to try today. They had a nice sampler option to select four beers to try which will be more than enough if you're a lightweight like myself. I recommend the Founders which is a beer and cider if you are also not used to drinking beer. It has the slight bitterness of beer but the sweetness of a cider. The Shandy was second on my list which is a golden beer and lemonade, the third is the Hefeweizen which helps you smoothly exit out of fruity and into the world of beer without a kick in the mouth!  This is smooth, not overwhelming and just right to make the transition. I was not a fan of the Jeremiah Red because it was too bitter for my liking.  As far as the food The golden beet and arugula salad was delicious as was the prime rib. It was seasoned well and cooked to perfection. Also, I might add, it was huge and the meal comes with mash potatoes, asparagus and dessert!

We were craving steak and mixed drinks so we were hoping for good service. And indeed we got it, EVERYONE REQUEST Willy Daniels for your server. Best server I've had in San Antonio, extremely nice, knowledgeable of the menu, and really helped us throughout our meal.  My boyfriend ordered the Long Island and i a had the white peach margarita. Personally not my favorite neither myself or my boyfriend could drink it. There was a gracious amount of alcohol in my drink. Don't get me wrong I love alcohol but this drink was 85% of it. I don't know, the peach and alcohol just didn't mix well. I asked Willy if I could try the strawberry margarita instead and he said no problem and gave me a strawberry one instead. The strawberry margarita was delicious, much better choice and our server was super cooperative and polite about it.  I than ordered the broccoli cheddar soup and the steak meal. Everything was delicious.  What made this trip worth coming back was our server, I'm in the food industry myself and I always appreciate great customer service.

Krista G.,"Blanco, TX",84,1,,4.0,9/25/2016,I just had a great dining experience. Valerie was awesome. I had the Texas style chicken fried steak at first. It was a little spicy for my liking.

I ended up with the Atlantic grilled salmon and 3 top shelf Margarita's. Make sure you re willing to pay 10 bucks a piece for those.

Upon entering they greeted us kindly and asked if we were rewards members. I said yes and gave them my information. They then welcomed us back and say us. The waitress was great and personable. When I ordered my food I verified there was no mushrooms as I have allergies and she confirmed there wasn't and also said that they had me marked down as having a mushroom allergy on her notes.

Linda M.,"San Antonio, TX",32,15,,4.0,1/23/2015,"Excellent ... wouldn't know that it's a chain restaurant. I brought my elderly parents here for an early (11:30) lunch today (Friday). It was a first visit for all of us, and we asked for their quietest booth. Although there were TV's playing, the noise was not overwhelming where we were seated. The ambiance is young but not noisy/crazy ... more professional and Yuppie. Now for the food.  Our appetizers were the fried calamari (a large portion of tiny squid cuts, lightly battered and crispy) and the Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli (basically, 4 large, soft hush puppies, only much tastier, and with a spicy bacon-y sauce!). My Dad ordered the House Top Sirloin at $13.95 and he said it was excellent and cooked perfectly to his order. He also ""accidentally"" ordered the tomato basil soup and said it's the only time he's ever enjoyed tomato soup! I tasted it, and it was truly delicious ... thick, chunky and fresh.  My Mother had the chicken tortilla soup. It was the creamy type, with nice chunks of chicken as well as fresh avocado. There was a fresh slice of lime floating in it, in case you wanted an extra zing in your soup ... a nice touch. Her hamburger was perfectly cooked also. After our appetizers, I didn't want a big entree, so I ordered the appetizer portion of Gourmet Mac and Cheese. This was my only slight disappointment.  It was described as ""Rotini pasta with three cheeses, chipotle and garlic. Topped with seasoned bread crumbs and smoked bacon."" However, I was unable to discern any cheese except perhaps some parmesan in the topping. The pasta was served in its baking dish and was quite tasty in its butter-and-oil with the seasoned topping; there was not much, if any, cheese that I could tell.  Nevertheless, at $4.95 for quite a large appetizer portion (which included two large garlic breads), I was very satisfied. Our waitress, ""Sam"" was outstanding. She was on the ball, paid extra attention to my elderly parents, and I even saw her practically running several times when things got busier. She definitely earned her 20+% tip. This place was a winner for us, and a return trip is already planned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=60

I would highly recommend this restaurant over the Chili's next door which I reviewed recently as well. See my review there and you will know why. The restaurant is laid out exactly like many of the others that I have been to. It's nice and large. There are plenty of TVs so that you can always see the game that you want to see playing.

My chicken was the rubbery, fake, cheap kind with fillers in it. But before I go on to the food, let's go onto the beginning. It wasn't busy and the hostess had had her back to us for a while. She was not paying attention and she turned around and apologized because she wasn't working because there was only two people in the entire restaurant. We ordered food and our waitress forgot our drink. App came out swimming in oil and undercooked. Seriously? It's fried... How can you undercook something that is fried. And the app came with such little on it. We hardly touched it even when we were hungry. We got our entrees with still no drink, and there fake chicken and with a fake pita stared me in the face. I have got to say this was by far the nastiest food I have ever had. The entrees look NOTHING like the picture and everything rings cheap. This place has high prices for what?  And thanks to the waitress who kept on flirting with my friend's boyfriend who didn't end up paying. Wrong way to be a server. Everyone counts.  To end, we were charged drinks that we never got.

Seldom seen from that point forward and never with a smile. Food took over 30 min from the time we ordered. I watched other pizzas be brought out that were ordered after mine by our waiter with no explanation. The deep dish pizza I finally received had a few meatballs in the center of the pizza with a couple diced tomatoes in the same area, but I basically paid $20 for soggy cheese bread. Awful.

Helena M.,"Bulverde, TX",0,2,,2.0,2/16/2017,"My friend and I went in on a Friday night and it was busy as expected. We sit down and our waitress comes and takes our drink and app order. She gets out the drink and later some other guy gets out our app. We had the entire time to eat our appetizer plus 10 minutes before we were acknowledged by her again. (25 total) then she took our actual entree order. She left and a new guy brought out our entree about 20 more minutes later. She didn't check up one time to see how our food was or anything. She did give me dipping sauce which I will count her for. I checked to see if she was busy, at some points I saw her laughing with some friends, engaging with other tables and not once did she with us. So when we actually finish our food she gets a box and we order a pizookie. It takes a good 15 minutes for her to even come over to us and say I'll go see where it is. So finally another guy brings it up. It was stiff, ice cream barely melted. Terrible. I was dissatisfied so was my friend. I was also pissed she was so engaged with other tables and refilling their drinks and when it came to us we were just a hurry up table. She gets our checks out and cashes us quickly. Then a manager came up to us and for the first time during the night we were asked how things were. I told him how unsatisfied we were and he took care of our meal.

Trisha A.,"Torrance, CA",1551,393,1576,4.0,1/13/2014,"my family and i came here on football sunday because all appetizers/ wings/ pizzas are 50% off! whenever there is a professional sport team playing, the bar section will offer happy hour specials. this deal only applies when you sit at the bar area so make sure to come early because it's first come, first serve.  we ordered the avocado egg rolls ($5.25) and it was filled with loads of avo, followed up with cream cheese, sun dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, pine nuts, chipotle peppers and spices. what makes it great is the sweet tamarind sauce. it really compliments the rolls. if you love avocados try this dish out! reg. price ($10.25) my favorite was the tuna ahi poke ($4.95) it had a great fresh taste to it. the only thing i didn't like was the crisp wonton chips, although it was good, every time i scooped the tuna the chips would break off. i just had to use my fork and eat it separately. it wasn't too salty or sweet and there was a right amount of poke sauce. the entree also included avocado and green onions, yum! reg. price ($9.95) my little cousin got the angus beef sliders ($4.95) and for $1 more you can add thin or wedge fries to your order. this dish was okay. i wouldn't order it for myself because it's too dry for my taste. each order comes with 3 mini sliders and the usual cheese, grilled onions, lettuce, pickles, and a side of ketchup. reg. price ($9.95) we also ordered the traditional wings (bone-in) ($4.75) we got the garlic parmesan because my little cousin can't take the spiciness. the other flavors offered are hot, spicy buffalo, exxxxra hot - 5 pepper buffalo, brewhouse BBQ, maui sweet or the teriyaki glaze. the wings were tiny and on the fatty side but it was still pretty good. im glad it comes with ranch on the side. reg price ($9.50) unfortunately for our pizza, we had to return it because the dough tasted funny... we think that it wasn't fully cooked through but im glad our server didn't have a problem with it and she gladly took it off our bill. the service here was spectacular. the manager was going table to table greeting everyone and asking if everything was okay. I'm always used to an overly busy packed BJs but this location wasn't crowded at all. my family and i had a great time! we paid around $20 and it fed a family of 4!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=80

If you read them, you know I was very unhappy with the treatment I received from the manager on shift the evening I went. This follow up post describes how BJ's management made every effort to right a wrong! How awesome is that?!! Too often these days people & business do not hold themselves accountable. I was very happy to see that in this instance BJ's did the right thing! Not only did I post a comment on Yelp!, but I also contacted BJ's directly through their website to make them aware of my experience. Shortly after, I was contacted by Eli, the Operations Manager for BJ's. Eli inquired about my experience & offered his apologies, he strongly, yet politely expressed that the treatment myself & my family received is not representative of the customer service promoted by BJ's. He seemed sincerely concerned that one of his managers would be so rude to any of the patrons. Eli stated that he would be coming to the restaurant to provide this manager with further training in how best to handle the situation I described in my earlier post.  In addition, Eli invited myself & my mother to the restaurant to treat us to lunch as an extension of his apology. My mother & I went for lunch & had a fantastic experience!

Brett B.,"Lincoln, NE",99,44,31,4.0,6/14/2011,"""Hand crafted cream soda"". Really, what more needs be said? Since this is a review I'll assume I need to writ e a bit more than that.  No problem. First, since BJ's is a chain this review is about my experiences with the whole chain as opposed to just one restaurant. I first dined at this brew house in Oxnard, California in 2003 and have been a patron at several others in the years since. Being a chain the experience is almost always the same, which is to say really good. I keep going back so it must have something to offer. I'm not much of a beer drinker so the appeal for me is the menu. From their pizza to their gourmet burgers, BJ's offers a very expansive menu that's sure to offer a little something for everyone.  For me my favorite is the French Dip. The au jus is pretty good, could use a kick up in intensity but what sells me is the horse radish. Flavorful without causing tears. Just the way I like it. As for the side, you can't go wrong with the skinny, thin cut fries. Crisped to perfection. Another thing I like about the BJ's chain is the locations themselves. Always roomy with high ceilings they are able to put a lot of people in one place without it feeling too crowed. Plus they always have a vast assortment of HD screens dialed into any number of sports. That always works for me. And oh yeah, about that cream soda. Don't think about it, just order it. Unless you're looking for something with a little more kick. Then I recommend The Captain's Mug, detailed in their menu as ""Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum, Root Beer Schnapps and BJ's handcrafted root beer"", it too is fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=100

Restaurants, brew houses or otherwise, so I was ""very excite"" to come out to Stone Oak and check out the new pub that will be built out at Alamo Ranch, close enough to me that I could stumble home if need be. It was a long drive but what the hell. I got the time.  From the outside it looks like a Ruby Tuesdays. From the inside it looks like a pair of Ruby Slippers. (that one was for you Monte Vista)  An assortment of 7 concurrent in house brews and 1 seasonal brew to accompany their fine selection of commercial taps.  A  ubiquitous warehouse decor permeating the hip trendy pub landscape these days with exposed painted air ducts and simulated glass garage doors complete with operational tracts for lifting and lowering. I don't know if they are functional but they sure are eye catching. Leather parabolic booths, half booths, pub tables and a crescent shaped bar accommodate any and all who have come for the deep dish pizza or the hand crafted brews. LCD TVs are strategically placed at all angles to divert the attentions of disinterested family members forced to sit at a table swamped with inane holiday banter or worse yet, no conversation at all.  Black Angus sliders served on buttery soft brioche buns with miniature tomato slices, pickles and lettuce on the side. Savory, meaty and perfect with the seasonally spiced pumpkin ale. Fiery roasted salsa served with tri colored chips for dipping was a nice compliment for the nutty BJ blonde. And when I say nutty i mean a handful of hazelnuts nutty.  For dessert I had the rich roasted coffee and chocolate scented Tatonka Stout with a creamy frothy head. It was nice to sip that while watching the ladies devour the homemade, fresh baked, triple chocolate pizzoni cookie topped with chocolate ice cream and chocolate syrup.  I wonder if the dishwashers have any idea that these dessert cookie platters even exist. After encountering countless empty miniature pizza tins with no more than an occasional chocolate streak running across the bottoms, I'm sure they have grown curious as to what could have possibly existed within those circular borders  Good luck fellas.

My favorite entrees are the turkey burger (one of the best I've ever had), meatloaf sandwich (this is a knife and fork job. Ordering this puts you in the splash zone) and the shrimp tacos for something light. Yes, the pizzas are really good too. Tip - DO NOT order the personal size. It is too small and it ends up being a pan of dough with very little toppings. Order a bigger size and take the rest home. The pizza will turn out much better. Dessert - get the Pazookie sampler.

They've got NFL Network too Gents so this is a def. spot to roll into during football season. BJ's is an all in all success and I'd recommend it to anyone passin through or looking for a new hangout.  TIP** if your goin to BJ's on Thurs-Sunday call and make a reservation for party's bigger than 2... it gets slammed and you'll find yourself waiting around for a table for a while.

I've always hit the booths when I come here. You should too. They're really comfy. BJ's is nicely decorated, and they have TVs all over the place, including big TVs at the bar area. If you didn't know, BJs brews their own beers and root beer. Their beer selection is fantastic, as are all the beers I've tried there. I've had the Brewhouse Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen, Piranha Pale Ale, Jeremiah Red, and the Tatonka Stout. Those were actually in order from lightest to darkest. I highly recommend the Hefeweizen if you like in between light and dark. The Jeremiah Red is really good too.  On top of having really great beer, this place has the best Spinach and Artichoke dip I've ever had. It's seriously amazing. I pretty much run a train on it every time I come here.  I've only had their pizza, so I can't vouch for their other food, but you MUST try the Great White Pizza. It makes your taste buds scream. This pizza is comprised of rich and creamy Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, seasoned tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast. It's simply the best pizza they have. I've also had their Buffalo Chicken pizza. If you like Buffalo Wings, you'll love this pizza.  I've never had an issue with the wait staff except for a time the waitress forgot to give us our spinach and artichoke dip before our pizza. The waitress was kind enough to give the dip and a dessert on the house though so I really couldn't complain. Conclusively, this place is a great chain.

Kay T.,"San Antonio, TX",1281,645,677,2.0,10/5/2010,"So, I don't typically review chains. But, because of the increasing popularity of this place, and the fact that I seem to frequent it for birthday parties and big gatherings, I feel the need to speak up on my experiences here. I've visited BJ's a number of times, everything from a date to a group of 10+ people. Each time I could sum up the experience in a few words: the beer is great, the food is generally decent (at the very least end your meal with a Pazookie and call it a night) but the service leaves me vowing to never return. I continue to go back because, like I said, BJ's seems to be a frequented spot for birthday parties and groups and I'm not one to miss a party. But, seriously, the service here is just plain bad. Well, when you can get a waiter to pay attention to you, they are friendly and outgoing and helpful, but the norm tends to be that they disappear for long lulls of time in which your drinks empty and your glass just sits on the table waiting to be filled.  Having waited tables in the past, I understand what a hard job it can be. And I can be very understanding of a waiter who is busy with lots of tables in a crowded restaurant. But, at BJ's, I have sat and waited on the server to return while watching him or her stand and chat with coworkers like they're on a break. It's frustrating to know you're paying for a service you aren't getting. And that is how all of my nights at this place have left me feeling: frustrated and thirsty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=140

I want to love BJs because I love great ""bar food"" and great drinks, but the operative word is ""great"" and BJ's is nowhere near great. The first time to BJ's, I had the grilled chicken club sandwich. Good concept but the ingredients were not top quality. It was mediocre and flavorless. The second time to BJ's, I tried a calzone. I seriously could have built a tastier calzone with some refrigerated Pilsburry dough and Hormel pepperonis at home. Not good enough. The third time to BJ's, I had the California Burger. For something with green chilies, pepperjack cheese, and chipotle mayo, it dumbfounded me how they made it so tasteless.  I must say, however, that the one really great thing I have had at BJs is their avocado egg rolls. They use perfectly ripened avocados, crispy wonton exterior, and a yummy tamarind dipping sauce. If you must go to BJs, get these. I feel obligated, no matter how revolting, to tell you the reason I will NEVER be returning to BJs again because I am so horrified. It is so disgusting that my husband and I made a pact to never mention it again. But for you, my fellow yelpers, I must tell you what happened. Okay, here it goes...we had the most horrifically snotty-nosed waitress.

I gave the waitress my premier rewards ID number, but I discovered later,  I didn't get credit for my purchase. Bummer!

Zain B.,"San Antonio, TX",194,97,20,3.0,9/3/2010,"Of course, it's just another corporate chain restaurant, right? Meh, for the most part, yes, but one of the better ones. BJ's falls in to the same catergorey has chilis, applebees, and other finger food restaurants. Though, its's spacious interior, and attractive exterior set it apart from the rest--along with the housemade root beer! This location has a friendly staff, and alot of seating, which really comes in handy over the weekends, when they are swamped with guests! I personally find their Buffalo Chicken Pizza and housemade Root Beer to be a perfect pairing! One of the best pizzas you can get from a chain restaurant. The crust is tasty and fluffy, and doesnt taste like dough, compared to other restaurants.  As for lunch, Im always partial to the fish tacos. They arent the best, but they are pretty good, not gonna lie! AND THE PAZOOKIE!--an oversized cookie, topped with ice cream. Does it get any better? No, it doesnt. One of my favorite desserts, for sure.  Love the vibe of this place, along with the numerous TV's. We visited a bit too often during the World Cup this past summer, each time was a great experience. You can see the TVs from almost any seat in the restaurant. The decor is a mix of a lot of different styles. I've noticed roman columns, along with a ""transformed"" faux-garage as the addition for more seating. BJ's is very eclectic in this aspect, which gives it a well-rounded, relaxed feeling! Nothing is over-done, which makes you feel less bound by a certain ""code of reaction"", if you will. BJ's isnt the best food you can find, especially in this side of town, but they do put up a good fight against the other corporate food service  initiatives. Even though I dont always make it my choice, it's always a consideration. And really, thats a pretty big thing...always in the back of my head.

Annie B.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,1.0,10/23/2010,"We stopped here for a late Sunday lunch; we should have kept on driving.  The food -- chips & salsa, Lettuce Wraps, Turkey Cobb Sandwich, and a Santa Fe Salad -- was mediocre at best.   But the worst came later -- all four of us were sickened by a terrible case of food poisoning that night.  None of us were able to work or resume our regular daily activities for 36 hours.  We reported the incident to BJs corporate office and have received no follow -up other than an automated ""thanks for your email"" response.  We also reported our illness to the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District -- they will be sending out a staff member to inspect  this restaurant and review food handling procedures.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=160
A M.,"San Antonio, TX",25,31,3,1.0,8/27/2012,Lousy service and expensive food/drinks. Definitely not worth the time or expense. Used to be good but gone downhill. Staff needs to relearn what customer service means.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=160

terry w.,"Austin, TX",397,137,90,1.0,12/25/2009,"the food and service here were extremely sloppy! i had the pot roast and my wife had the baked potato with chili. the pot roast was mostly fat, the carrots were uncooked, and both the celery and the onions were untrimmed. who wants to eat onions with the dirt-ridden roots still intact? my wife's baked potato was even worse. the giant potato looked like a pretty regular-sized russet to me. and the heaping ladle of chili? it was only about 1.5oz of liquid sauce speckled with 6-7 bits of ground beef.  our waiter was playing hide and go seek the entire night and only refilled our drinks when he brought us our check. the manager was abruptly intrusive. when he came back to check up on us, he interrupted our conversation by slamming his palms against the edge of the table and asked how we were doing. i later went to the company's website, read their ""our promise"" section and decided to write them about our terrible experience. it's been over a week and they still haven't done any type of follow-up. we ate here as a last resort cause there was too much traffic on 281 for us to drive around looking for food. needless to say, we won't be making the same mistake again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=160
Jaime G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,17,3,4.0,9/18/2011,I go to BJ's quite often when I am in the area. I have never been dissapointed with any of there meals. The large tv makes even more enjoyable to watch games.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=160
Beer P.,"Asheville, NC",27,15,31,4.0,10/19/2012,"Awesome Oktoberfest (what? those aren't awesome!?) and an IPA that they said had 6 different hops and actually tasted fresh... in San Antonio...kinda, is this Bulverde up here already? Oh, an the Pook's Pilsener- I have had it a few times now and it's always nice; dry and crisp with a substantial malt character that is completely balanced and nuanced by the spicy hops. That beer is one I would buy to take home. Also, the pumpkin ale was one of the best pumpkin ales I have had. Very spicy and kinda heavy/sweet, but overall a very drinkable beer around 5% abv. It's easy to overspice a pumpkin ale, but this one was very smooth and not astringent or ""bitey"" at all. The happy hour in the bar makes it a great time. As long as the Pook's Pils or the Hopstorm IPA is on (or the Oktoberfest) I will keep coming back for the 1/2 price boneless wings... M-F 3-7pm. Great job St. Arnolds for the brewing and right on BJ's for the great customer service and product knowledge. I hope the other locations are just as diligent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=160
Theresa D.,"Spring Hill, FL",2,20,19,5.0,8/15/2010,"I would rate this a five for a sports bar.  We had a party of 12 and did have a reservation. Our waiter, Shiloh, was AWESOME ... which can be a feat with such a large party.  But he made sure all of our special requests were taken care of spot on.  We had a range of items from the wide variety of choices.  I had fish and shrimp tacos - one of each! Very good! The rest of our party had burgers, shrimp pasta, clam chowder, club sandwich, assorted flatbreads ... And everyone really enjoyed their choice.  I tried the Blonde Beer, and it was nice and smooth ... You may as well give the microbrews a try since that's part of the ambiance. It was a bit noisy ... But it is a sports bar with TVs strategically located.  All in all I thought it was a nice place and Shiloh is a great waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=160
Stephanie S.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,9,,4.0,3/25/2013,"This place is a step above Chili's or Applebee's. Food was good, and we're not easy to please (see my review of 54th Street Grill, which is nearby.) The margarita flatbread and spinach artichoke dip were actually really tasty.  Calamari was just so so, though. Handcrafted Margaritas on the rocks were really, really good (memorably so). Our server, Spencer, was very polite and professional -- not intrusive, just right. He did an excellent job and it made our experience pleasant. The decor is interesting and comfortable. All positives except that the hostess gave me the hairy eyeball and looked me up and down both times we went there, which was weird. This is a tasty place worth spending your pesos at... Two thumbs up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=160
Traci D.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,2.0,4/29/2012,"Follow up review.  Last couple of times we've eaten at BJs, its been disappointing.  The management seems to be at the center of the problems.  Plus, they have raised their prices and the size of their portions are smaller (i.e. gluten free pizza).  Guess they thought we wouldn't notice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=160
Breanne S.,"San Antonio, TX",227,97,38,4.0,7/17/2008,"I was lucky enough to be able to attend the soft opening of the first BJ's Brewhouse in SA. The waitstaff was fresh-faced and new, the decor was beautiful and cozy, not yet having scratches on the floor or gum under the tables. The employees were all REALLY great and helpful and seemed happy to be at work... however, I am taking that with a grain of salt, since they've been working there for only a week or so at most. I'll reevaluate the waitstaff in a few months when they've had time to realize how much people can suck when you're serving them (and when they don't have a trainer staring over their shoulder, watching). Right now, though, they are all top notch! Now, if you know anything about me (which you don't), you know that I love me some fish tacos. These were pretty freakin' good, which I was not expecting. Panko-crusted halibut in tortillas that were just thick enough not to bust through, with chipotle mayo and an avo cream sauce and salsa. YUMS. The table next to us ordered a mouth-watering (looking/smelling) deep dish pizza from which I had to restrain myself from yoinking a slice. Our table was generally pleased with what we ordered - my fish tacos were the winner of the flavor contest and a salmon fillet came in second place - and I will definitely go back to try that pizza. From what I understand, the burgers are also great, and they have a dessert called a pizookie (giant hot cookie, ice cream, spoon, mouth...) which I'd like to have a taste of as well. A++, would eat it again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=160
JoAnne B.,"Universal City, TX",0,2,,2.0,11/5/2011,Last night this place was awful. Our service was terrible. The waiter brought the wrong order to someone in our party.

Micah C.,"Berkeley, CA",71,1,,4.0,9/7/2008,"Great beer! Good service.  I went there twice, which is a compliment since the first time they screwed up our order pretty well. The reason I'm still impressed with them is they bent over backwards to fix it.  They straightened out the mix up and comp'ed our meal. The waiter did a great job of making sure we were taken care of and happy, despite the mix up.   They also make their own root beer which is delicious. And give them a bonus in my book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=180
Kent W.,"Austin, TX",1,11,4,5.0,1/31/2012,"Utterly unfamiliar with San Antonio so I couldn't tell you which one we were at, except it was near the Alamo Drafthouse. Honestly from the name we were expecting a Hooter's/Twin Peaks kinda place, and in that respect only was I disappointed. We ordered a mojito and a ""BJ's Irish Root Beer"", which was Jameson's, Bailey's, butterscotch schapps, and their home-brewed root beer. The mojito was good, the Irish Root Beer was fantastic. I drank it too fast, so just had the home-brewed root beer after that, which was every bit as good by itself. The menu was overwhelming; wonderful selection, and it took me a good 20 minutes to narrow down to one dish, and 10 minutes of that was between the jambalaya and the parmesan-crusted chicken. We had the pork chops, and the jambalaya; the pork chops were very good, and the jambalaya was as good as jambalaya gets outside of New Orleans. Hate to gush, but I was VERY impressed with everything we consumed. The service was adequate to good, but the cuisine more than made up for any shortcomings in any other category. I will be back, and very soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=180
Ron L.,"Houston, TX",0,145,,4.0,9/12/2010,"We had a really large group on a busy night but with the help of the staff, were able to put some tables together in the bar area and avoid a long wait.  Most of us ordered pizza - they have a ""happy hour"" during football games (basically all day Saturday) with half price mini pizzas.  They were small but very tasty and with some appetizers enough for a meal.  The BJs beer was very good and they also have a really good selection (20+) beers on tap.  Lots of TVs to watch football/sports.  Bar area was large and a lot of fun.  Will defintely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=180
Colin S.,"San Antonio, TX",12,21,7,4.0,9/5/2009,"Loved it! I got the Beer taster. My wife got the Tropical mojito. Mine was awesome hers was OK. We both agreed that that the mojito was a little too sweet. Our waitress Helen was a doll, and she gave great suggestions and service throughout our meal. We ordered the Avocado egg rolls which were great until our entree arrived. My wife, who claims she always gets ""Out Whataburgered"" by what ever I order, decided to get the calzone. She said that it was pretty good but nothing to write home about. I ordered the Angus California burger and it was excellent! it had a few different cheeses on it. The bread was similar to Texas toast only better. The Angus was exactly how I ordered it, medium and was plentiful and juicy. My wife agreed that it was one of the best burgers she's tasted as well. After we were thru with our meal, Helen our waitress was right there with our check and just enough smalltalk. I'm sure you've been to restaurants where the wait staff is too chatty. ""Would you like some more soda? Ya know I just can't drink those anymore. They remind me of my step father. He had boundary issues. I'll be right back with your check."" Helen wasn't like that at all and the wife and I had a great night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-antonio?start=180
