Karla M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,3,1,5.0,12/31/2017,"was out in san bernardino with some friends for the weekend to go to the rolling loud music festival and were staying at the fairfield inn, which is next door to this bjs. on a sunday morning we were hungry and decided to head over there for brunch, since it's only a couple steps away from our hotel. we sat in the cocktail area because there was happy hour, and close to the tvs for the football games. we started off with one server but got switched over to elyssa while she goes on break. elyssa was amazing, she took good care of us and recommended their seasonal grand cru, which i really like. if you ever head over to this bjs i would suggest asking for her, you won't regret it.  happy hour is a great time to go for the bjs beers, only $4! and really good apps for $6. if i'm ever in this area again i'll definitely be coming to this bjs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino
Liz A.,"Riverside, CA",40,14,2,1.0,1/2/2018,"***NOTE: This review is based solely on customer service over the phone. It's pretty bad when you don't even go into the restaurant before posting a bad review***  First of all, BJ's and I don't have a lovely history, but I decided to give it a try today anyway. I have a meeting coming up in a few days and I was looking for a place with good food and thought, ""why not BJ's?"".... Yeah they reminded me why not BJ's. I called to set the reservation and this is how the conversation went.  Phone rings. Employee answers.  Employee: Thank you for calling BJ's. How many I help you? Me: Hi. I'm looking to make a reservation for a meeting on Monday. We are looking to have about 12-15 people. I'm wondering if your restaurant would be conducive to a meeting of that size? Employee: Sure, I'm going to have to get my manager for you. Please hold.  ***Hold for about 3 minutes** Employee: Thank you for holding, just give her a few more minutes and she will be with you.  Me: Okay ***Hold for 15 minutes*** Manager: Hi. Thank you for holding. So you want to have a meeting here. When are you looking to hold it? Me: Monday, January 8 at 11:30am. We are looking to have 15 people there. Would that work with your location? Manager: Okay. Let me put you on hold and check my calendar.  Me: My last hold was 15 minutes, would it be sooner than that? Manager: Yes. I'll be right back.  ***Hold for 10 minutes*** Manager: What time did you want to have your reservation? Me: I was on hold for another 10 minutes. Are you guys okay over there?  Manager: **giggles** Yes, we're just really busy because it's our lunch hour and I'm trying to make sure everyone gets served. Me: Right. But it has taken me 30 minutes to make a reservation.  Manager: **ignores my comment** May I have your name and phone number for the reservation? Me: No thank you.  ***end of call*** I called Macaroni Grill to make the same reservation and it took me less than 5 minutes and their manager was very friendly over the phone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino

Peter C.,"Redlands, CA",2,36,37,5.0,1/12/2018,I've been coming to BJ'S restaurant for quite a while and I have to say this is the best location ever. The staff is friendly and quick to get you a table. The waitress was very presentable and knew how to read tables. Never did our beverages get past half way empty. Our appetizer came out quickly and our food was hot and presentable. Thank you Natasha for giving me and my friends a great experience. I enjoyed this visit and will be returning in the near future and will be asking for the same waitress.

Brianna V.,"Yucaipa, CA",1,10,3,1.0,1/11/2018,"I love this restaurant but every time I go here we end up with the slowest waiter that just seems to always be having a bad day. Just a few days ago I was here with my 2 year old and friends, the waiter kept forgetting to bring us drinks or check on us and he forgot to bring my sons apple juice for him but I didn't remember till we got home (wasn't to important I guess) and my order wasn't quite right. My pizza was missing a few toppings but I'm 9 months pregnant so I'm not one to complain and send food back at the moment.

I sent back my frozen strawberry splash for its utter blandness. It tasted like a milk shake. My BLT salad came complete with a twisted thread from someone's hair. I sent it back. The quinoa and Salmon was good, the salmon was not overcooked.  Had to wait a while to be seated while the hostess gathered menu from empty tables.

Our orders were a little of everything, arranging from steak to salad to pasta.  Each dish was cooked perfectly, and came out at just the right temp.  The alfredo was a little skimpy on the broccoli, but once my husband mentioned it, a side of steamed broccoli was brought out almost immediately for him to add to his existing dish.   Their signature dessert was on sale, and ashamed to say-we bought and demolished three of their Pizookees.   Must say the hostess was very entertaining and energetic and was shocked at our first visit, but made sure we had all the details need to make our visit special!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino

Kenny G.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",299,1009,961,3.0,1/20/2017,"Let's face facts. If you've been to one BJ's, then you've pretty much been to them all. What separates the harlots from the hoez' is by FARRR,..........the customer service and overall flare of the location itself yet, ......this particular location, resting off of Tippicanoe, fellow pizookie loving Yelpers, may just leave you with blue balls and a need to dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT caus' I've certainly put better into my mouth..... Wait a minute. That didn't come out quite right, lol. What I meant was..... uhm..... Better yet (leans back.....) let's just commence within this review...... * * * * * ""Eeenie weenie, teenie weenie, shriveled little short short ....."" Sauntered in on a Friday evening. My sister made the trek from Vegas to celebrate her 13th ""21st"" birthday and with that in hindsight, the least I/we could do was drive from LA to meet up with her and her crew, right?  Fortunately we were stuck in traffic stemming from the rain and EVERYONE knows that Californians can't drive in spit.......let alone condensation. Consequentially, this better enabled my sis' and her posse' to wait (within our absence) and better secure seating, and we were able to walk in - to VIP treatment, bypassing the unprivileged to join her party.  In advance, I find this ironic but AIN'T IT A SHAME THAT WE HAD TO DRIVE OUT FROM LOS ANGELES TO ORDER AN ""L.A. WATER""????  From sit down, were we all addressed and our server was outstanding until he went on break and his replacement went MIA.  Y'all know, I'm from ""the city"" and indicative of such, I reserved no hesitation in ordering a round of shots! For just around $80, we were all able to ring in the night and this, seemingly set the tone for our miserly session of dining whilst in the lovely I.E. (spoken with all due sarcasm).  While the place was packed and parking was a clusterphuk, the server did his best in getting our booze back to us at light speed. Hardly hungry and still pissed from the previously endured gridlock, I requested 'artichoke dip' ($8.95) as well as a side of --something-- else.....and in all truth, had it been any bit revolutionary, I'd probably recall the name of it right now.  Need I state that upon downing a tablespoon of both items, they were duly rejected; quicker than a hooker caught without her paperwork.  I viewed a number of folks requesting additional items; from pot stickers to calamari and nachos. * The irony however, is that NO ONE cleaned their plate, nor did they request a doggy bag, ""to go""!  Now I ain't one tuh' gossip, .....but isn't the TRUE testament of consumer satisfaction when a guest unbuckles his/her belt after licking the plate clean? ----- I'm just sayin'.  Monica Lewinsky must've taken a off day.  It's a brewery so I'm certain the beer is fine, thereon, I'm more of a wine/cocktail fella' and regrettably I'm unable to report on such. As a last method of recourse, I ordered the clam chowder.  (sighs........)  Suddenly it became so dayum clear that I was just NOTTT meant to be at this place. I haven't been this bamboozled since ...(thinks to self), I mistakenly went to 'The Chicken Ranch' in Pahrump, NV and attempted to order buffalo wings.  O__o Perverts, feel free to read on that experience here:    NC-17 colloquialisms aside, I'm obligated to render the following assessment. BJ's has presented itself as being a marginal franchise's attempt in conveying nothing short of meager American cuisine, with hit or miss service and lines that rival the DMV just to get in.  Hadn't it been for the booze and customer service, I'd just have easily provided this location 1 star.  Further placing things into perspective, EVERY guy loves a BJ yet this particular location provided somewhat of a disappointing ""Happy Ending"". By no means am I taking this place completely off of my list, if anything, now it's just muddling around the bottom like ......that one hot chick with syphilis that you have to think twice on texting at midnight.  Factoring in all of the other options around (which doesn't say much when in San Bernardino).........you might go so far as to request Uber pick her up, but you for damned sure know that she's not worth traveling to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino

Their pizza is a long-time favorite of mine. Their ""Nutty Brunette"" and ""Jeremiah Red"" beers are my faves in the beer category.

Her smile and her attitude were the best. The food was excellent as well. Not one compaint from our group. We ordered bonesless wings, sirlion steak, tuna salad, spinach dip and more. Some of my coworkers traveled from the east coast and had never heard of bjs. They were impressed!

LOL I've heard that there isnt much of a difference, no offense).  I ordered my normal strawberry lemonade and I ordered a Bison BBQ Burger and a house s.  The house salad is always a favorite at restaurants for some reason.  I love starting my meal off with a house salad and as usual, it totally hit the spot.  Then the Burger came out and it was a big burger!  I am personally a big fan of burgers from BJ's.  Seldom am I not satisfied with their burger.  So this was my first  time eating Bison!  I was so excited!!!  The burger was REALLY good!  It totally hit the spot and Bison (if that is real Bison, is REALLY good!  It cae with a side of fries, which I didnt really care for.  My co-worker got this spinach artichoke pizza which I jacked a few pieces of course!  The pizza was really good!   The service we had was awesome!!  I had to personally go to a waiter and tell them that we were in a bit of a rush and Man, oh man!! They all got kicked into gear!!  At one point we had like 5 servers bringing food out to us, checking on our drinks... it was freakin awesome!!  Overall, This was probably the best experience I've had from the staff to the food from any BJ's I've been to!  If you are in this area, you're very fortunate.

J C.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/4/2017,"A week or so ago, we ate in the bar area.  Our waitress was slow in getting to our table.  All we wanted when she did come was water, while we looked at the menu.  Time ticks by.  Nothing.  Then after a very long time, we notice TWO tables of people that came AFTER we did, got their drinks!  When I walked up to the hostess and requested a manager, this guy named Jose shows up.  I explained what just happened and he said, ""I apologize.""  But I wasn't done speaking.  When I told him that it wasn't right that the waitress did that, he said to me in an irritated tone of voice, ""ALL I CAN DO IS APOLOGIZE!"" Wow! I got his business card from the hostess and it says ""Senior Manager"".  Very unprofessional for someone of his status.  The service was slow.  Our waitress didn't check on us and the whole experience was disappointing.  I have celebrated many a birthday at this location, but never again.  After contacting BJ's through email from their website, I get a call back from the Gen. Mgr. Brian Sunday.  I explain the whole ordeal.  He was apologetic etc, and offered to make it right with a $25.00 gift card.   So last night, we decide to give it one more try.  ANOTHER HORRIBLE experience, but even worse!  We sat at the bar again, even at the same table.  Our waitress was extremely slow, worse than the previous experience!  After my friend waited and waited, she asked another server for the two samples of beer she was supposed to try.  More waiting...Finally it came.  After deciding which one to get, the beer came in a glass that was narrowed to a stem at the bottom.  This is important because that's where she was holding it while she drank her beer.  But then at one point she slid her hand up higher and felt something hard and crusty!  UGH!  No one wants to feel crusty things on the outside of their glass that they have been drinking out of, who knows what it is for God's sake!  When she told the waitress, there was no apology and she said she would pour it in another glass.  Another beer came.  I went up to the hostess desk and asked if ""Brian"" was there, and he was.  He came over, I reminded him that I had spoke of the phone with him a week before, and then told him what had happened with the beer glass. I also inquired as to how many tables a waitress has, and he said 5.  Again, he was apologetic for our experience.  He offered us a free pazookie and took the gift card paper, and brought us the receipt and said he took care of everything.  Good thing I looked at the receipt because the waitress had charged us for TWO beers!!!!!  I asked for Brian and he was in a meeting and we got ""Roxy"".  Had to explain the whole story to her, and then she went and fixed it.  In the mean time our waitress came by and said, ""Oh she's adjusting it.""  NO APOLOGY from her!   The pizza that I always order from BJ's is definitely NOT worth the horrible service!  I will NOT be returning to the San Bernardino location ever again.  Maybe on the way to the beach, I would stop at BJ's but not here.  There is something definitely wrong with the service in the bar area and maybe Brian should address that by reducing the amount of tables a waitress has so she can give better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino?start=80

Ronny M.,"Santa Monica, CA",7,47,49,1.0,6/22/2017,"So this is my second review for BJs in about a month. Last month we had a graduation luncheon at another location in Ontario. I posted a review and the general manager reached out to me to give BJs another shot. Well, we did. And I'm sorry that we did so. The service was terrible once again. My girlfriend and I decided to try the near by BJs in San Bernardino for Father's Day. My daughter showed up a little late and unfortunately also experienced a bad experience as well. Basically our waitress barked out quick sentences at us like a drill Sargent. ""Djou reddytoorder""!! Then would run away like faster than Forest Gump. I mean, geaze. The group next to actually got all their drinks, conversation from the waitress, and even refills!! I'm starting to wonder if these establishments don't like dark haired men with dark skin and beards!?!  I was not asked or offered water since I ordered the 4-4oz beer sampler. I was not offended another round. Was not asked if the beer was ok.  At first it was the 2 of us, my GF and I. I ordered a medium pizza for my daughter and I as she was late and on her way when I ordered. I also ASKED! Does the PIZZA a medium sized, PIZZA feed 2,TWO, PEOPLE!?? Hint hint!! That means there will be 2 people eating pizza!!  So when the tray arrives for the Pizza to sit on with a plate, not 2 plates, but 1 plate. We also at that point asked for silver ware as well.  Later about 5 minutes after the pizza arrived so did my daughter. I gave her my water after about 15 minutes of conversation and eating as the waitress did not ask my daughter if she wanted to order or a liquid drink?!! More time goes by as it is Father's Day and we are eating and drinking our soda and water? Yes, only 2 drinks still at a table with 3 patrons!! PLUS!! Our drinks are bone dry at this point. So we patiently wait, as our waitress zooms by like we don't exist, oh wait, she had time to slap a bill down and race away with our 2 drinks dry as a camels tongue!! My daughter even said that she never even saw the waitresses face she was so in a hurry helping everyone else but us.  This waitress was by far the WORST I've ever experienced. And I've been to Europe where they don't care about service.  Never ever giving BJs a chance again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino?start=40

Alyssa R.,"San Francisco, CA",58,27,27,1.0,5/14/2017,"I get it, it's Mother's Day, they're bound to be backed up and busy... but here's a little customer service tip, acknowledge your customers and let them know you haven't forgotten about them. ""Sorry we're running a little behind, we'll be right with you. Thank you for being patient!"" EZ. Anyway, the 1* review isn't for the long wait and poor service, but the food itself.   Calamari:  Came with a slice of lemon, and no sauce whatsoever. Bland, unseasoned, with no dipping sauce. Parmesan-Crusted Chicken [sub mashed potatoes for crispy thin fries]: This is supposed to be topped with a lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, but there was literally none to be found. It also came with regular fries that were nice and soggy.  Blackened Chicken Alfredo [add extra sauce]: They must have confused ""extra"" with ""light"" because if they had served it up with a tablespoon of pasta water it would have been more moist. For some added fun, there were undercooked, hard and chewy pieces of pasta.  Not only were they unable to deliver special requests but they failed horribly at the basic entree itself. If you're going to make your customers wait, at least deliver food that is enjoyable to eat instead of totally screwing up their dinner by slapping some sh!t together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino?start=40

It seems like no matter where you sit you have a clear enough view of the game,if not they're fine moving you to where you are comfortable. I've come in for brunch and had an absolutely fantastic meal-country fried chicken with toasted corn and potatoes and gravy!! I love this dish-never take it away. I often order you ribs dinner because it never fails me,but your pizzas are to die for. I ordered a half and half to celebrate one of my staff members completion of his training and he was sooooooo happy! He loved your  delicious combinations! I will continue to recommend BJs to my guests because no other restaurant on Hospitality lane as lived up to their service,value,or quality of food.

The hostess at the desk had a stink face & not so inviting attitude about our polite request even after we advised her that we didn't need to all sit together and that we would be happy with just tables close to each other. The servers however turned that all around, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. They were Attentive and had great attitudes about dealing with a couple of separate checks and a big group. We got our food fast and it was yummy! My first buffalo burger, good stuff!

As an appetizer we orders chips and tomato salsa that came with free refills, but she never refilled it. I order a bacon and avocado cheese sandwich with potato wedges. I can't complain about lunch because it was delicious! Potato wedges had a perfect texture and taste. I also ordered a strawberry margarita and it was made just right with the perfect amount of alcohol. As for the appetizer, the chips were also delicious and crunchy. The salsa had a really good flavor and wasn't spicy at all. Overall, the location is good and the food is delicious but the customer service isn't that great.

I'm big on service and that's what this review is mostly about.  The waiters are very polite, but I always get a sense of being ignored. My girlfriend ordered the Grilled Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo ($14) and asked for extra Alfredo sauce. We received the entree but we were waiting on the extra sauce and after 3-4 minutes of waiting we were so hungry we just started to eat. While we ate I was trying to flag down a server and finally when I was able to get a hold of one they said, of course, just to give them a minute. So when another 3 minutes went by I asked another server if they could get us some extra Alfredo sauce, and their response was, ok i'll let your server know. By this point we already gave up on getting our extra Alfredo sauce.  But, finally our server returned to refill our drinks and asked if we needed anything else. We discussed what happened and I guess she just forgot and the other server that said they would inform her never informed her. She apologized multiple times and seemed sincere about it, so we just left it at that.

We barely saw her our entire dinner. When we got our food there was a reacureine of things being in our food that should not have been. When we asked for our check we got more attitude. The only reason I am giving this place three stars is because of the quality of the food, when we got our food and it was correct it tasted great and the portion size was great for the cost.

The drinks came with the appetizers. I never received the water I asked for. One of our meals was wrong. A dessert was wrong. I had to ask twice for something that should have come with the drinks. They sound like small things, which I would agree with if all the small things didn't add up after so many.  In the past my wife wanted to come here for her birthday. The entire family went. The service took so long for everything that my wife and family left and I still had to wait for her birthday pizookie in a to go container and the bill for almost 20 minutes. Pathetic.  Please train your staff to function as well as your food quality and I'm there. And it's not for lack of trying from a few. My waiter was busy. I get it. He wanted to do better. The real culprits were the waiters in the close area.

Lumin A.,"Beltsville, MD",8,5,,1.0,4/24/2016,"A party of 15 of my friends and myself went to the BJs in San Bernardino as part of a party of groomsmen after our rehearsal. We requested to be seated together and were told there would be an hour and a half wait. We inquired about an area of the restaurant that didn't have any people and were told by the hostess that this area was closed off for the night. In order to avoid the wait we sat in booths that were close to each other instead. As the night went on we noticed that another large party entered the restaurant and were immediately seated in the area that we were told was closed for the night. At this time the restaurant was less crowded than it was when we had arrived. When we inquired about this, the manger told us that the party seated there had a reservation and that's why she opened that area up. She was extremely rude and condescending during this exchange with us. This also didn't make a lot of sense because the hostess gave us a different story. Of course the manager didn't realize that we could ask the party in question if they did have a reservation - which we did. And guess what - of course they didn't. Now we were a group of guys that look Indian/middle eastern and the group that got seated in the area in question were all white. Did racism have a role to play in this situation- I'm not sure... You be the judge of that. All I know is we were extremely disrespected at this establishment and will not be going to another BJs again.

We also ordered a mini pepperoni pizza which tasted great and came out fresh. Crust was cooked well. For dessert, we had the pizookie with white chocolate macadamia cookie. This was also yummy!

Our server checked on us pretty frequently for how busy it was and he was accommodating and let us stay until the game finished.  I definitely recommend this BJs.

Sara T.,"Chino, CA",2,22,,1.0,6/5/2015,"I generally love BJ's, but I tried to go to this one on Wednesday and was sadly disappointed that my friends and I didn't even make it past the hostess station.  Here's what happened, and trust me, I wish I was making this up. We walked in and there was a woman standing at the counter.  We waited a few seconds and when she didn't greet us, I said, ""Excuse me...""  She looked up and said, ""Yea?!  What do you need?""   Me: ""Um...a table?  We'd like to be seated please."" Her: ""What do you want?"" Me: ""To eat here.  I'd like a table for three."" Her: *Sigh* ""What do you need from me?"" Me: ""I need for you to seat us...""  By this point, I'm really confused.  She's the hostess.  She's holding menus in her hand.  I mean...as the hostess, really, what did she think I needed?!  Now, another woman walks up.  She said, ""What's going on?""  The first woman said, ""Ugh, I don't know what their problem is and I don't understand what she's asking for, but I have to go help other people."" The second woman says, ""Oh sorry guys, what can I do?""  I said, ""We wanted to get a table for three.""  She asks our name and as I started to answer, the first woman comes back and sighs and says, ""I don't understand what their problem is and what they want!"" At that point, when the other woman asks again for my name, I said, ""You know, we're not going to eat here after all.  That was so bitchy that we won't be back,"" and we left. Now, I understand that people have bad days, but seriously?  Like I said, I love BJ's.  I typically go to the Rancho location or the one at Eastland, and I have never gotten less than fantastic service.  I would have expected better from BJ's, and I will certainly not return to the San Bernadino location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino?start=180

She even came and said goodbye and introduced us  to our new waiter when her shift was over. Moving on; The food was great! I ordered a steak, with cheesy potatoes, and green beans for the sides. I asked for my steak medium rare to well-done and that is exactly what I received. Very juicy, very well flavored. Really, really yummy. My potatoes were perfect as well. Not chunky, very smooth, and very cheesy! The green beans were also very nicely cooked. I added just a bit of salt to my taste, and they were perfect. The environment was nice. Very calm and quiet.

The hostess was quick and polite, escorted us to our seats and immediately got us set up with drinks and an appetizer order. The appetizer mozzarella sticks were fantastic, nice and garlicky (because that's a word now). Crispy outside, gooey center, the way a cheese stick is supposed to be. So that was tasty. For the main event, however, we ordered the lunch chicken Alfredo for the lady, and for moi, the 14oz rib-eye in medium-rare, because this is America and that's as close to tasting freedom as it gets without stuffing a flag into your mouth. Both dishes were brought out in good time, and the food was great! The meat was tender and juicy, but properly cooked. I also liked that the waitress didn't hit us up every 12.3 seconds to ask us if we were okay or if I'd seen the last season of LOST. All in all, it was fantastic. The bill kinda hurt, but I mean you pay for what you order, right? So, 5 out of 5! Thanks BJ's for the great time. Sorry we didn't get to hit up the pizookie this time but I'm already fat.

Well 10 mins pass and new people came in and were seated right away while we were still waiting. So of course that annoyed us and when we approached the hostess again she just said wait there. Not friendly or professional AT ALL.  After being seated we were approached by out waiter Anthony. He was great. He was all smiles and super friendly. You can tell he was a good waiter because when we asked for our Beers he carded us(which always makes me feel good) when normally no one even asks.

Breanna S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",52,82,4,2.0,6/23/2015,"Well... First off we were seated at a smaller table and upon asking to move we received a bit of an attitude. Once we were moved to a larger table we were told our server would be Melissa. Melissa stopped by about 5 minutes after we were seated and we were told she would be right back. I have worked in the food industry before (from hostess to server) and I know for a fact that there are food runners at BJ's. About 10 minutes and there's Melissa running food out to her table as we sit there without drinks. She finally comes over for our drinks, we tell her what we would like, she asks if we want any appetizers we order two (the calamari and mozzarella sticks) she asks if we're ready to order our meals as well.... UM HM... first you ignore us then you want to rush us? So she brings our drinks a few moments later and we're told our appetizers will be out shortly and that she would bring us some plates (there's six of us at a large table).Well as soon as she said that she would be back with plates our appetizers arrived. We were over half-way through with them before she came back with plates (about 6 minutes and yes I was timing her because I was extremely annoyed with our service). She took our orders asked if we wanted refills and we didn't see her until about 2-3 minutes before our food came out to clear off our empty cups and plates. Our food was decent, not the best I've had from this location, however. Once we were finished with our meals we were asked if we wanted dessert we passed and asked for boxes. The only time she even seemed remotely interested in being our server was when she set the check down (after paying) and told us to enjoy the rest of our day. You cannot provide horrible service and then put the book down and be cheerful at the end of our visit. She received at least the 15% tip but only because we do not dine and not tip.  If she had too many tables or too many guests she should've let someone know and the host or hostess should be instructed how to sit guests accordingly. Having an off day? Let someone know if you can't work through it. We all have bad days but you cannot let it affect your customers. We came down from Lake Arrowhead to enjoy lunch and that really didn't happen.  This was my birthday lunch and I can honestly say I should've gone somewhere else.

Felicia L.,"Long Beach, CA",599,1593,658,3.0,6/13/2012,"I've been coming here for a couple of years now. They are known for their pizza and their pizookies (pizza + cookie... actually its just a baked cookie in a pan with vanilla ice cream on top). Also they have a happy hour which is good, with $5 mini pizzas, good priced appetizers and drinks. While the pizza has been consistent in the past few times I've been here... the pizza I had just wasn't the same. The dough really makes BJ's a distinctive name in sit down pizza chains lol. While it was still a thick crust... it wasn't as soft and buttery as it used to be. Whatever.  Oh! We also got a ahi tuna salad last time I was here. It was good with the vinagrette and the nice amount of tuna slices around. It was big enough to share between 3 people with a good portion. Got a red velvet pizookie which has come to be my favorite. The other flavors are good as well (chocochip, white macadamia, oreo, just to name a few). For a regular size it was good to share between 3 people as well. On your birthday, you get a free pizookie! But again with these apparent changes... where the pizza lost its quality to me, the birthday pizookie has lost its quantity by being a mini size instead of the regular size. Whatever. As for other food, they have a wide variety but from what I have tried, it's nothing amazing. Just regular American fare. They do have a light menu, which looks appetizing but I never actually order anything from there due to my true fatassery...  As for the restaurant it is a very casual American bar like setting. Dim lights, American art everywhere, a big bar and multiple TVs around the restaurant. Service was good, always checking up on us. During the day, this place is pretty chill but by dinner time it could be crowded... I suggest calling in to get a table before your arrival. This is a good place overall, considering the variety of restaurants in the area (which really isn't saying much hahahahaha).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino?start=220

On the other hand, however, is their quality of service.  For some reason their service always seems to be poor when we are there.  Now....granted...it's a busy social place.  But there always seems to be plenty of waitstaff to go around.  Without exception, they have been slow...forgetful...air headed...even rude sometimes!  A place can have a bad night, sure, but it seems to be every night we come there.

Yvonne C.,"Riverside, CA",1,1,,1.0,5/2/2016,"2nd time I had horrible service! First time I understood more of the reason because there was a server breaking our original server while he was on break, I'm a waitress I totally understand how it feels to have to break a server and be like ""uhh okay let me just hop in where you left off."" But the 2nd time I go I think our servers name was Lisa horrible job! We sat in her section for a while before even getting greeted like I said I am a server also so I know how it feels to be slammed but at least greet your guest and say your a bit busy and you'll be right with us, she wasn't even the one to greet us it was another server with a beard nice guy, he took our drink order & appetizer order both different timings because our server still wasn't around to greet us, by the time she came she said sorry. Cool! No worries.. She takes our order my bf orders something said ""scratch that"" IN that moment she was taking our order and had went with a different dish when the food comes out mine perfect & his was not the original meal he had ordered. Her excuse was ""I'm sorry I remember the pita tacos by memory"" okay??? Your writing our order with a book look down and read what you wrote. Another guest that was behind us the food runner brought there appetizers & food to us. So homegirl needs to learn her tables again that's not a big deal I understand that happens. But it was just the experience her customer service was bad she said she was going to give us a refill and the manger came and did it for us because she kept walking passed us not even saying a thing to us. I'm not saying I'm the best server we all make mistakes but girl at least let me know something I'm very patient all I ask is for you to at least let me know that your a bit busy shows me your acknowledging me but nope.

She did take our order fast but after that she forgot about us. My husband had finished his first drink and needed another to wash it down. We waited about 10 minutes for her to come back to our table and another 5 minutes to relieve the drink. At the end another waiter saw our disappointed faces and asked us if we needed anything and we asked for our check. Our waiter came and gave us our check and I asked for a to go cup.

I want to say her name was Melissa. (I'm terrible with names, but I know it started with a M) anyhow she was awesome!! She got our drinks right out.  A little bit later she brought out my soup & salad but explained there was a mishap in the kitchen and somehow my husbands pizza got lost, but it was in the oven and would be right out. She offered him a salad on the house. He didn't feel like a salad and we told her no problem.  Seriously, 2 seconds later the manager (I assume, he had a blue shirt and dang it I didn't get his name either) but he came to our table and apologized for the mishap, again we told him no worries. He told us if we needed or wanted anything to let our server know and the pizza was on the house, we told him it was no problem and they did not need to do that.  Literally half a min later his pizza came out! And it was perfect!!! They didn't charge us for the pizza as promised. If they hadn't told us that the pizza was lost, we would have never knew and wouldn't have questioned it taking a bit longer because sometimes pizzas take longer.  I was totally impressed with the service and really wanted to take a moment to share! My husband and I work in our family's business (RV repair) and things happen, things get overlooked, things get forgotten, that's all apart of being in business. And one negative thing about Yelp is that people LOVE to run home, hide behind a computer and bash a business because maybe they were busy and their drinks didn't come right out. Or perhaps the greeter was having an off day and didn't smile as expected. Anyways, I wanted to make a point to say we were totally satisfied and impressed with the service we received at BJ's today!

(And yet still forgot to ensure our salad dressing on the side). We are generous tippers when we are welcomed with good service. We almost didn't want to leave a tip at all.  However we still did at about (15%). Cuz we're not complete jerks.  After about a 7 to 9 hour drive, she was a big downer to our vibe.

I called in an order for curb-side and was told that curb-side ended at 9pm but that I could order take-out. ""No problem"", I replied. I then asked if they had the 2 for $22 deal which she confirmed they did have. Great. So I ordered our usual, A shareable pizza with easy cheese (lactose intolerant), seasoned tomato and extra sauce. Tortilla soup and caesar salad with a pazookie rounded out our order. We used to come more often but have stopped due to the increased level of poor service.  So off I went to go pick up the food. Then I receive a call from BJ's. The young lady that I just spoken with is now informing me that they no longer have the deal. She then asks if I want to cancel the order or order something else. Bewildered, I ask to speak with a manager. The young man gets on the phone and begins to tell me that the special ended Tuesday (Yesterday, being Friday). I then ask if it is now Friday why his staff has not been informed of the specials or lack there of. He then explains that he will allow me to have the special and repeats again that the special ended Tuesday. Great right? He handled the issue and took care of his customer... not so much. I arrive only to find that they have to remake the pizza order because the chef did not want to add the stewed tomatoes.  I waited another 20 minutes for the the pizza to be remade. Now here is some back story. I order that same pizza all the time. 80% of the time it comes out correctly. I have had it sent back multiple times only to have it be brought back incorrectly again. Easy cheese, Stewed tomato, extra sauce... a classic tomato pie... sounds easy right. One time, while dining with my wife, a good friend of hers and her son I placed the same order. The kitchen manager Horacio brings out the pizza personally to my table. When I tell him that the pizza he brought me is simply a cheese pizza (not even easy cheese at that). His reply was that he could bring me a side of stewed tomatoes to put on top. And then began to argue with me how it is the same thing as baking it with the stewed tomatoes and cheese and top. REALLY, THIS IS YOUR KITCHEN MANAGER!!! It is not the same thing. Should he actually try it sometime, he may actually taste the difference. So back to present day. So here I am waiting for the correct order to be made (Wonder who picks up the tab for all those sent back orders). Not once do I see the front end manager come out. It almost seemed like he was hiding in the back. When I asked to speak to the manager in person he finally surfaced. Believe it or not he begins to tell me that the problem is that the stewed tomatoes don't come on the shareable. SERIOUSLY!!! Now this is why I feel you need a new front end manager as well.  BJ's Restaurant has an app for smart phones that allow you to order ahead. I have used it several times. I encourage BOTH OF THE MANAGERS to follow along on their smartphones as they both, obviously, are in some serious need of training. Ok, so now open the BJ's app. Select curb-side pick up. Choose a shareable hand-tossed build your own. Select the veggies option. And whaaaat... SEASONED TOMATOES ARE AN OPTION for a hand-tossed. To Chris Fernandes, General Manager and Shareholder. Your company location deserves better management than this. You have some excellent workers in your servers and hostesses. But there is only so much they can do without the support of management. I hope that someone takes note of this, as this used to be one of my favorite spots.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-bernardino?start=240

Jonathan M.,"Loma Linda, CA",361,1,,1.0,6/6/2015,"I celebrated my 21st birthday at BJ's and the food was great. I ordered a pizza with a drink and it was enjoyable. However, I am giving them one star due to their customer service. As we were paying our bills, my total comes out to be $26. I told our waitress Patricia G. that I was going to pay with $23 in cash and wanted the rest on my debit card because I only had $20 remaining in my card, which would not have been sufficient to pay my bill. When she came back with our tabs, I noticed that my card was fully charged $26 (the charge took some of money from my savings account) and none of my bills were in the tab. She claims that she did not see any cash in my tab. I was confused because the cash was securely and visibly tucked underneath the card. I am not sure if the money fell out of the tab or she took the money (which I am just saying could be just a possibility, I am not accusing her of theft). They ended up taking the pizza off the bill and just charging me for the drink.  At the end, I still lost money. It was definitely not a pleasant experience, especially for a birthday celebration. I just wanted to let everyone know to be aware of your payment and make sure that the host charges correctly. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.

Jenny C.,"Redlands, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/28/2012,"The two stars are only for one thing: the red velvet Pizookie. Everything else, especially the service, need serious improvement. We come here about a couple times a month because the food is pretty awesome, the Pizookies are to die for, and my husband loves the Abby Normal seasonal beer that is sometimes available in a bottle by request in the off season (I believe it is a spring time seasonal beer) Anyway, there has only been one or two visits that we have had decent service. Every other time, it has SUCKED. We came one Sunday afternoon at 2 pm for my birthday. We called ahead the day before to let them know we wanted to have a party of about 10-12 people the next day. They assured us that it would be no problem, especially in the mid afternoon, not peak lunch/dinner times. Unfortunately, that was not the case. We spent a total of 4 hours there and maybe saw our waiters (I'm not even sure how many we had, we ended up just flagging down whoever was close by when we needed something, that's how bad it was) about 3 times. People in our party arrived all within a 15 minute window, but no one's drink was brought until our appetizers arrived, and we were all thirsty. I can't believe that with all the people ""serving"" us no one could get waters for anyone. It's not hard. I can understand beers or mixed drinks taking a bit at the bar, but water? Come on. Entrees were arriving sporadically, even though we all ordered at the same time. Some were finished eating completely before others even got their meals. Nothing was complicated, just basic pizzas off the menu and a few burgers. It was absurd how little attention was paid to us and how long we were there. My husband complained to the main waitress that was serving us after asking her for the third time for a water refill and she said ""OK, but we are all doing our best here to serve you, please be patient."" Ok lady, we have been pretty patient, considering I was ready to get up and leave after the 30 minute wait for appetizers and drinks. We don't have all day to spend waiting for lunch/dinner, be reasonable. I don't even think she believed herself when she said she was ""doing her best."" In the end I got a free personal red velvet pizookie so I was happier, but still disappointed overall. The added gratuity for our large party was just a pain in the ass since the servers really didn't do anything to earn it.  We continued to return after that experience and unfortunately it has not improved, maybe even gotten worse. Lots of people standing around when it's busy and customers need service. They just don't seem to have consideration for customer's time. We always spend way too long waiting and I don't want to spend my entire day in a restaurant for dinner. More than 2 hours from entrance to exit is too long when there isn't a sporting event to watch. Get some more attentive wait staff and this place would be 5 stars. The food is too good not to return and I consider myself a patient person which is why I seem to endure the torture of the horrid service.

We shared two smalls among four people, and that was more than enough! A few friends also got a plate of three mini pizookies, which was an awesome idea. So, good (service and dessert). If you've never had a pizookie, you have been extremely deprived in the dessert department.

As for food, I went with the Parmesan crusted chicken with lemon sauce, potatoes, and broccoli.  Again, I was starving, so I devoured the plate.  The chicken was crusted to perfection.  Maybe I loved this dish because of the fact that I hadn't eaten in over eight hours. The place looks very dark and almost rustic with many seats at the bar and high chair seating just behind the bar stools.

I stopped in here for lunch with some fellow students of mine the other day. When we arrived, the place was relatively empty. We were seated rather quickly (yay). Then we sat for 10 minutes before we were acknowledged and our order taken (boo). Then we waited 30 minutes for our appetizers to arrive (boo). Then less than one minute later, our entree arrived (boo). Sounds bad? well the story goes on (lets be optimistic shall we?). I was kinda impatient as I sometimes can be. But in all honesty I was all ready in the restaurant for 40 minutes and had not even tasted one thing! I was sad :(  so i asked to speak to the manager. He was quickly ushered over by our server. I explained our situation and he was BEYOND gracious in apologizing and such. He said he would comp. my tomato and mozzarella salad (which was fabulous!)  Then something else happened... He returned less than five minutes later to explain that the kitchen was backed up with salads (?) . Sounded.... believable...????  He then said he then offered us dessert on the house. I am not big into sweets, but... The pizookie trio was, how shall I say this without wetting myself?... Kinda like a sweet ""O"" in my mouth. The red velvet pizzookie was nice. The Oreo pizzookie was even better. The white chocolate macadamia pizzookie has made me a believer in desserts once again! That stuff was great!!!  One of my friends had the stuffed mushroom appetizer that we shared (that was lovely). I ordered the gluten-free thin cheese pizza. That was the weirdest pizza I ever tasted. I still can't put my finger on it. We all tried it and agreed that it was indeed weird. It  was bland and can only be compared to a frozen pizza (a a bad one at that). Or a piece of cardboard that was put in the oven and topped with cheese (YIKES!). I would definitely steer clear of that concoction. Our bill arrived and we were stunned to find that our bill was say rather TINY... I wont say what or how much was given to us (after all, I would like to be polite and gracious). It was far beyond what was promised and we left with fat smiles and giggles (yes, i really did giggle). The manager is my new BEST FRIEND (ok not really, but he is a cool dude).

No complaints at all BUT I feel that the food has gone greatly downhill. I used to LOVE BJs and the deep dish pizza was always worth the cost. Today, $15 for a small pizza was NOT worth it. It kind of tasted like Pizza Hut with thicker crust and better quality toppings... but still extremely unimpressive and overpriced for the taste. The stuffed mushrooms were... gag!

Jesse S.,"Peoria, AZ",0,1,,1.0,3/12/2015,"This was probably the worst experience ever. Went on vacation to California. On the way back to Arizona I saw BJs from the freeway. I told my girlfriend hey lets eat there Ive heard great things. We were sat immediately.  At first the server was very friendly and seemed like she knew what she was doing. Took our order. First my other guest asked for no tomatos on her salad. Salad comes out with tomatoes.  My girlfriend and I ordered appetizers. Never came out. About an hour goes by before the manager comes to our table. He says ""How is everything""?  I say weve been here and hour and have not even recieved our appetizers. He proceeds to tell us that they had a computer malfunction and our food is on its way out. Which means the server forgot to ring it in. Food comes and he walks away while saying hes going to give us a discount. Food came out looking and tasting horrible!! They even forgot one of our appetizers. The server proceeded to ignore us the rest of the time. The manager didnt even check back to make sure things were better. I had to ask a busboy for my check. This is my first review. I am in the industry. I never complain. But something has to be done.

SERVICE - Its PRetty Darn Good. I can't complain about their service at all. They go great length to keep you a happy camper.

Jill C.,"Redlands, CA",54,6,,4.0,10/6/2013,"I am a huge fan of BJ's, and have been to countless locations. Our usual order is a little out of the ordinary, but not complicated, and we have had numerous negative experiences. We've been told by many employees that the Buffalo Chicken pizza comes with a mix of buffalo sauce and BBQ sauce to keep the heat down. I have even emailed a manager regarding this issue, and have been validated.  Unfortunately, even after this, I have been argued with and I have been told that I'm wrong. More often than not, I receive a pizza with BBQ sauce on it, or a pizza without ranch (which seems to be the general ""quick fix"" to a staff member who does not believe me or want to deal with me). I, too, work in the customer service industry, so I understand what it's like to be on the other side, and perhaps that is why I have never made a huge issue of this. However, when I order my pizza with specific instructions, pay 25 dollars for it, and receive it with BBQ sauce again, it kind of sucks! And it's even worse when we get hell from the staff when ordering it! We get our pizza made correctly about 50% of the time, and we get argued with about 80% of the time. It's an unfortunate trade-off. Tonight, we placed our order with an employee named Perry. Of the countless employees we've encountered, he had the BEST attitude regarding our weird order! Even if our pizza was made incorrectly again, it was certainly less glaring with excellent customer service.

Keith H.,"Beaumont, CA",32,5,,1.0,12/19/2011,"The one star is based on a single experience. Normally the food and staff are great. This was not the case last night. My wife,4 kids and i arrived for dinner looking for some fantastic pizza. We arrived around 6pm. The only booth that was available that would seat my family of six was in the bar area. We took the chance and took the seat at the bar. The Sunday night football game was on the big screen and there were plenty of people watching the game. Our server Sandra started off good by coming around quickly and taking drink and appetizer orders. She quickly brought out drinks and the appetizers were soon to follow. It all went down hill from there. We finished our appetizers and drinks and then sat there waiting to order our food. Sandra finally came by and took our orders. She didnt refill the empty drinks at the table but finally came back 10 minutes later with new drinks. Having not had a soda in a while i drank mine quickly and then waited 15 minutes before Sandra took the empty cup. She took it and didnt come back with another for over 20 minutes and only after I asked if I could get my drink please. The food came out and the kids orders were fine but the great white pizza with extra tomatoes had very few tomatoes. There were several pieces that didnt have any tomatoes at all. When Sandra finally came back to check on the table i asked her if this was extra tomatoes. She said she placed the ordered with extra and this was extra tomatoes. She said that she would order a side of them from the kitchen and bring them out right away. 15 minutes later she brought out a side of tomatoes. The side of tomatoes was the equivalent of 2 pearl tomatoes chopped up.  This was not nearly enough to qualify for extra tomatoes for an extra large pizza. I asked Sandra again for extra tomatoes and she acknowledged that these were a joke and she will order enough for an extra large pizza. 15 minutes later she finally brought out a small cup of tomatoes that was finally appropriate. By this time unfortunately we were done with the meal. i only had one piece of pizza as well as my wife. We asked for a box to go. Sandra brought us the box and the check. I looked at the check and noticed that she never entered extra tomatoes on our pizza. She was just lying to us when she said she did. We immediately placed our card in the holder for her but she had left in such a rush she didnt even see the card. After waiting for ten minutes for her to take the check my wife took 3 of the kids to the car. I waited for a couple of minutes staring at Sandra take care of one of her other tables that were receiving prompt pleasant service and then finally asked the bus boy to take my check. He told me that he would let my server know that it was ready but I insisted that she was not helpful at all and I just want to leave. he took the check and handed it to Sandra two tables away. She now promptly returned with my card and bill. She had the first smile on her face I saw all night and told me thanks for coming in tonight and to have a great night. I have never not given a tip to a server, in fact it has to be mediocre service for me to even give less than a 20% tip. I worked in the restaurant business for many years and know that it can be rough. Sandra received NOTHING for a tip.

Mike J.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,51,,2.0,5/15/2013,I ordered the mahi mahi with the grilled shrimp. It came with veggies. The only good thing about the meal was the fish. The grilled shrimp were a joke. It looked liked the shrimp were under a heat lamp for a few hours. I bit the first one and it was ice cold. I told the server if I could have another set of grilled shrimp. She took my shrimp and came back a few minutes later with the same set of shrimp after it was thrown into them microwave. I had eaten at BJ's in Westwood and was satisfied.

Imagine our surprise when we found a BJs opening in San Bernardino!  We were quite loyal fans at first, then the pizzas and burgers just weren't as good as I remembered them.  The pizookies are great, though! We solved the waiting problem by going at off-times and sitting in the bar area, which is self-seating. The final straw came when they no longer were allowed to sell beer in growlers, since this location doesn't have an actual brewery on the premises.  Haven't been back since, and now we have yet another useless growler, since other places won't fill one with another brewery's logo.

What amazed me was the fantastic level of service that Crina D. provided us. She was our server both nights and, aside from being amazingly beautiful (I have Facebook: please add me haha) provided us with fantastic service. It was really the little things: how she managed to remember all of our orders (she even remembered what beer I'd ordered two night prior), what we were drinking, she knew when to check on refills, and her overall demeanor and ability was just amazing.

It's quite an interesting change from the usual pizzas one finds, and luckily it's a delicious variation as well. I can also heartily recommend any of their burgers since the meat is exactly the kind of quality you expect. I'm personally not too keen on their french fries, but many people I know like them.

The main knock on BJ's is the pizza which is sad considering it's a pizza joint. The problem is, its just......odd. Their pizza isn't Chicago style. It's not New York style. It's just odd. If you order the typical BJ's pizza, you get a thick crust pizza that is fairly light and crispy on the outside. It's good crust. The problem I have with it is the lack of sauce. They simply put cheese on the crust and then the standard topping, Roma tomatoes. If you like sauce, just order it on the side. The pizza definitely tastes better dipped in marina if, like me, you find the lack of sauce sacrilegious. The reason I still give BJ's 5 stars is that literally everything else I've ever ordered has been good. I like the burgers, the sandwiches, the salads, the appetizers, you name it, it's good. It's also quality food. You can tell a lot about a restaurant from the lettuce used in their salads. You won't find much yellow lettuce in their salads. It's quality ingredients through and through.
