Abbey M.,"San Diego, CA",884,81,1373,4.0,1/4/2018,"BJ's... this place is always my go-to place when I can't think of a place I want to eat at... lol. Not sure why they don't have a better score on here but my visits have gotten better since the first time i've been! Those with 3 stars and lower.. please let me know when you go.. so I don't go on those days. lol STORE: This location is in the same shopping center as Starbucks, Barnes and Nobles, Smash Burger, Which Wich, etc. There is a decent amount of parking here, you may just need to walk a smidge. The outside is always very clean when I go as well as the inside. This location tends to always be busy.. at least when I go. Which I would assume is a good thing..? right? lol. They have a bar, outside seating, T.Vs everywhere to watch sports, table sitting - booth sitting - high tables. Cant complain :) MENU: Large Menu - something I dislike is my menu is always sticky or stuck together.. that freaks me out since I can be a germaphobe, but other than that, theres something for everyone here. Pizza? sure. Pasta? Sure. Sammich? Sure. Watching your weight? Sure. Dont care how fat you are? Sure. My go-to for this place is always; - Strawberry Lemonade: sh* is bomb. Nuff sed. - Calamari appetizer: I'm not sure why I love their calamari so much but theyre one of the best ive had. There was one time it tasted different cause they used different calamari and I was about to lose it.. then came back and it was back to being the same deliciousness that I remember. So.. I can't complain lol - CHEESE CURDS appetizer: This was new on their menu when I first had them. Oh goood lawwwwrd I love me a cheese curd. Just deep fried cheese.. hell yeah! Just know its A LOT.. so be ready to share it or... eat it all, who am I to judge? lol - Chicken Alfredo Pasta: I tend to ask for extra sauce on the side cause it can be dry (at least to me since I like my sawwwce). So I like to control the sauce by pouring it myself. - PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN BREAST: My favorite!!! It's topped with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. That is a goooood night. If you want to substitute the sides you obviously can, but I never do cause I like to pretend that I am somewhat healthy lol. - PIZOOKIE: Just all of them. Its a must. My fave is getting the trio cause... well who wouldnt want 3 different cookies with ice cream?! Cookies and Cream is my fave tho! WORKERS: It can be a hit or miss, but as of lately all of them have been great. I always give extra points when they give you extra napkins and refill your drink before you even ask. Those are my sweet spots. lol NEGATIVE: Nothing really worth reporting. I've had slow service before or had to redo one of my meals but I meal, everyone has their off days. So as of now, not much.. OVERALL 1-5: Location (outside): 4 Location (inside): 4 Appearance (product): 4 Service: 4 Taste: 4 Mouth feel:  4 Overall: 4 Would I come back?: Always do.. lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2
Joanne A.,"San Diego, CA",1,1,,1.0,11/21/2017,1pm- seated 115- water given and order taken 130- food arrived 2pm- bill given I ordered soup and salad. The lentil soup was Luke warm and my wedge salad overdressed. My waiter did not refill my water or check on me at all. I didn't even have a chance to place another order. Now I'm at the drive through to have another meal because I'm still starving. I just wasted my lunch hour and money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2
Joy M.,"San Diego, CA",429,427,9118,4.0,11/14/2017,"Wow, this review is long overdue.  We always stopped by here every time we hangout in this area. BJ's is literally our ""go to"" restaurant in Mission Valley area. Because they serve quality food and fresh, handcrafted beers in a casual, high energy atmosphere. The workers/ team members here exude a warm, friendly attitude. Gimme 5! And I loved their Enlightened menu my kind of low-calorie, superfoods, vegetarian and gluten-free options. We usually order: Chardonnay and Beers. My fave-Arugula Beet Salad, Salmon & Quinoa plate and their signature pizzas. Yum-O!   Came here recently after Barnes and Nobles books shopping (they're in the same shopping area). We greeted and seated right away. The staff here was polite and made us feel welcome.  For our recent dine in- We ordered 2 Chardonnay's @ $6.50 and Riesling $7.25. Appetizer: Turmeric Cauliflower $4.95-Entrees: Peruvian Quinoa Salad with Chicken $13.75, Salmon Dinner $ 19.50, Kale Brussels chicken salad $13.95 and to go GF chicken spinach pizza for kiddos-$15.25.  Decent price.Their extensive menu has a great deal of variety and can satisfy anyones taste. Overall, tasty food in a great friendly atmosphere. Always impeccable, nice big booths for families and friends. Big screen TV's, Nice bar and great seats to see any game in any season. We enjoyed our lunch- My salmon veggie plate was always perfection!Must order! YUM-O.  Loved the Kale Brussels salad super healthy options my new fave it was generously portioned salad shared for 2. dang it!  no more room for    the famous Pizookie dessert (never mind I am counting calories, Lol!  also, I love their premier rewards program. I redeemed $5.00 from our total check. That was cool!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2
Victor M.,"Tustin, CA",0,39,32,5.0,1/13/2018,"Prices are great and the food was good. Didn't order a entree but everything is the menu looks good and there are many choices. I got a flight of 4 beers for $9.00. Appetizer for $7 two IPA beers for $16. What made this experience next level was our waiter Samuel, he has great customer service and was very respectful and caring.

Cathee C.,"San Diego, CA",28,101,200,3.0,11/1/2017,"Nice location with lots of booth, bar, and patio seating but the food wasn't mind blowing. I only come here once in a blue moon when the pizookie cravings hit hard (Am I right ladies?!). And of course $3 pizookies in October brought me right back here. My chocolate chip pizookie with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream was of course heavenly and hit the spot right away! I just wish the ice cream was more frozen so it doesn't instantly turn into a soupy mess, making the cookie soggy.  My boneless wings were lukewarm so that turned me off right away. The hot and spicy buffalo lacked flavor and heat. The root beer flavor wings were surprisingly tasty! But again, room temperature and wings just don't mix. Overall, food will continue to be average here, but the pizookies are where it's at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2
T C.,"Escondido, CA",0,7,1,2.0,1/7/2018,"1/6/2018 - went in at 4:00 p.m.  Understaffed at the time and told had to wait 15 minutes for servers in a restaurant not more than half full. Fine, sat in bar for quicker service and ignored.  When asked for service from an over 6 ft tall blonde male server, he was visibly ""bothered"" and had bad attitude. More than likely will NOT return to this particular BJ's near Fashion Valley.  My fault for venturing out of North County.

Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4068,28004,3.0,7/14/2017,"I had lunch at BJ's after a nearby meeting. I did not order one of their many well priced lunch specials but I did take advantage of their Mondays 1/2 priced deep pan or Tavern pizzas and a small wedge salad on the side of course. I went for BJ's Tavern Classic which came with mushrooms, pepperoni, and Italian mushrooms with a red sauce for $7.50. The salad was about $4. The wedge salad was very good and they recently changed their blue cheese dressing. It was a great change because the dressing was delicious. It was thick and creamy and came with tasty chunks of a mild blue cheese. The quart sliced wedge was crisp and fresh and I was pleased that they did not hold back on bacon. It was very good bacon too with a good crisp and a nice chew as well. It was a very nice salad over all. The Tavern Cut Pizza was good too, but they forgot the topping that was the main reason why I ordered the Tavern Classic, the mushrooms. When I brought it to their attention, they made a side of mushrooms to place onto the pizza, which was nice, but not the same.  If you like very thin crust pizza that is similar to a thin flat bread, these Tavern Cuts are for you. I like the thin crust and it surprisingly held up well to the ingredients a top. The pepperoni slices were tasty with a touch of spiciness, the crumbled Italian sausage was good, but although moist, it kinda had a spongy texture to it. I suspect it was previously frozen. The mushrooms I received were a little dry given they were not baked with the pizza nor were they sauteed. The red sauce was nice, not overly sweet nor acidic. Service was very good. Angela was attentive and certainly forgiving for the mistakes the kitchen staff made. Either way, the 1/2 pizza Monday's is a great deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2
Martanday S.,"San Diego, CA",793,92,243,3.0,5/9/2017,"Love their Pizza! We usually dine at BJ's on Monday's as this is the day they have half off in large pizzas. Ambience:- Huge, they have outdoor and indoor seating and if it gets full which I doubt then you can grab a chair at their bar, quite nice. They could use some more lights as it gets dim at night. Food:-  1-; Chicken quesadilla  2-; Large Vegetarian pizza 3-; Chicken wings  Great so far, we usually order their large pizza, strawberry almond salad,chicken burger with fries. This time we tried their fried chicken and it was ok not great but still good! Service-: They could improve a lot on this front, servers comes across as slow and not the most attentive kind, one time I ordered easy cheese on my pizza, but instead I got no cheese  Pointers:- Please improve your customer service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2
Dominique C.,"San Diego, CA",18,80,53,1.0,9/3/2017,"Ugh. Twice in one week. Twice just mediocre food.  Went with a friend - they left out the avocado of his mahi mahi salad, and that's why he got it! I had a salad that had the worst combo of items. My bad for ordering in the first place but they just threw all the ""super foods"" together without considering taste at all. ""baby kale and romaine, quinoa, sliced apples, fresh blueberries, crisp jicama, sweet corn, asparagus, diced cucumber and tomato"" Just stay away! I had hopes for them making random a$$ ingredients work together cause they are a restaurant, but they failed miserably.  I have no idea why the place is always busy. The second time hubby got dry ribs -- huge no no. I got just a side of beets with goat cheese. HUGE potential - but someone decided to dump a lb of salt on it. Oops. Top that with the saltiness of the goat cheese, totally not a good combo. Their house beer is ok, but nothing special. I would opt for the bottle stuff instead. The only thing I've had there that has been ok has been a cheese dip. Not enough for me to come back for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2
Mel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",238,1504,8255,4.0,3/31/2017,"My sister always picks BJ's when we meet for lunch or dinner. She dines here a lot since it's minutes from her office. I know it's a chain and Yelpers don't do chains. But this Yelper does. One thing about chains is that they're consistent. They can be consistently bad or consistently good. BJ's is one of those chains that's consistently good. The menu is extensive and their pizzas are the bomb, especially the Great White Pizza (chicken & Alfredo sauce). I've only been to this BJ's about 10 times in my life and my meals have been the same almost every time and that's their calamari as an app, the salmon for my main meal, and a small Peanut Butter Pizookie with Vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Overall, the service is pretty good and the food always hits the spot. I'm sure that I will be back.

Tranae L.,"San Diego, CA",133,23,57,4.0,11/17/2017,"I went into BJ's Mission Valley around 10 and we were promptly greeted and sat by the hostess who was friendly. It was Thursday night and so it wasn't as busy as a weekend night, but I still appreciated  the prompt service. We needed up moving to the patio and were greeted by our server Jonathan. He was patient with us (literally takes me ten years to order) and gave us honest opinions on the food. He was super hilarious and made me feel welcomed which was the big reason as to why I liked my experience. Also every fellow coworker was nice as well. Everything was prepared great. We had the avocado egg rolls, the Thursday rib special and their holiday ribeye special. BOMB  I had a great dinner and enjoyed our whole experience there.

SeanTodd A.,"San Diego, CA",3,20,,3.0,1/2/2018,"The deep dish pizza is good. They do have a large variety of food and dinner to choose from. Some of the sauces are too rich and sweet, like the sauce on the salmon dinner. I had the special Monday $5 margarita and it was very bad, I only had 1 sip. It tasted like a melted lemonade popsicle, very heavy on the syrup. But the primary issue we had, seated in at a booth in the bar area, was with our server. She had poor customer service. She had a bad attitude, and made our dinner uncomfortable. Also they messed up the bill in their favor with no apology upon having to fix it. It was a shame, cuz, like I said, I do like the pizza. I cannot overlook this bad service we received, and the bad margarita.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2
Desi T.,"Santee, San Diego, CA",11,16,4,4.0,12/23/2017,I come here pretty regularly. There is a wait most times but is to be expected. Wait staff have always been helpful and quick.

Amanda S.,"Brookline, MA",108,25,2,4.0,1/1/2018,"For what the restaurant is (essentially a glorified Applebee's), I was impressed.  The Enlightened menu had shrimp Peruvian quinoa bowls, which was average, but seemed fresh and healthy, unlike the microwaved crap you'll get at most similar chains.  The Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie was to die for.  Reasonable prices too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2
Bert G.,"San Diego, CA",83,609,444,3.0,7/8/2017,"My first ever dining experience at any BJ's location !  And right now, I'm waffling:  Two Stars or Three? Our party of eight was promptly and efficiently seated after two tables were butted together.  We ordered beer by the pitcher (very cold !) but were presented warm glasses.  The selection of beers is spectacular. The beer menu shows the IBU scale (International Bitterness Units).  This scale will prevent any accidental orders of face-puckeringly bitter beer. My wife ordered the Seared Ahi salad ($15.95) and loved it!  She said it was perfectly prepared with an excellent dressing.  Sitting next to her, I can tell you, it looked good. My order was not up to par.  The Fish & Chips ($15.95) consisted of several small pieces of  cod, over-breaded and deeply ordinary, accompanied by a large amount of over-salted fries.  Perhaps the idea is to encourage more beer sales by over-salting?  It sure encouraged water consumption later ! There were other problems, given there were eight orders.  One was a hamburger that was way overcooked, although ordered medium rare, ironically accompanied by an undercooked baked potato.  Another individual had a food complaint, as well.  In addition, a discount card was presented but wasn't honored.  Granted, the manager very politely and quite obligingly rectified every problem, and the total bill was reduced accordingly.   The manager's professional behavior, and the good service we received make BJ's in Mission Valley A-OK in my book.  I'll make a different menu choice next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2
Melinda J.,"National City, CA",287,86,265,4.0,1/3/2017,"Came to this location and gave it a second chance which happened to be ten times better then the first. Our server this time was Elizabeth and we sat in the bar area where we got to pick out on seats. She was very good at getting us water and not taking a long time before taking our order. I love that they have so many screens that you can watch the games on. Which is great for sports fanatics.  As a table we ordered 2 pazookies (the oringial chocolate chunk and the cookies and cream), spinach and artichoke dip, and buffalo wings. Everything came put within a reasonable time and was all so delicious to help our hunger cravings.

I am told they would go find my waiter. 5 min later some one comes by and asks if anyone has shown yet...of course no.  She indicates that he's busy with a big party.....SERIOUSLY? NOT MY PROBLEM. Then you shouldn't have sat me at his station if he can't handle a big party and me and my guest.  She takes our drink order and walks away...not to the bar to place the order, but to another table to take an order.  Feeling done knowing no one is coming and its going to be a long wait, and I just want dinner.  I get up and leave.  NEVER coming back.   Went to the Dennys across the street.  Seated, placed an order and got a drink in 10 min of arriving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2

It comes with avocado eggrolls, chicken, mozzarella sticks, spinach & artichoke dip, and maybe something else I'm not remembering? Well you won't have to know since you won't get it since I told you not to get it (haha!) because it was super underwhelming. The chicken and mozzarella sticks are for sure from the frozen food aisle of Costco, avocado eggrolls tasted meh, and so did the spinach & artichoke dip. The food was kind of cold as well, what a waste of money.  If you do come here, get the deep dish pizza. BJ's cooks the crust quite well! The crust is crispy and has enough oil saturated in it to make it moist. Dry crust is a chore to eat, always need water since thirst overwhelms your desire to eat more crust. Not a problem here. If I had the pizza itself, maybe this place would be a four star establishment, but the disappointment from the appetizer dish was pretty big.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=40

Ellie K.,"New York, NY",0,5,,3.0,10/16/2017,"I go to this location often, and never had an issue until this past weekend when I decided to order through their curbside to-go. The girl who took my order was Janelle (spelling?) and she was unbelievably rude. I asked for an extra side of hot sauce for my wings, and when it appeared she had misunderstood, I repeated my request just for clarification. She proceeded to snap ""yes I'm going to get it now,"" and then (this is the part that blows my mind) rolled her eyes and shook her head IN MY FACE before storming to the kitchen. As someone who's worked in the service industry for 10+ years, I understand being stressed out during rush, and I even understand if you really need to vent by rolling your eyes and being nasty. But you do it privately in the back or at home, not in plain view of the customer. She ended this exchange by returning with my side and asking sarcastically if there was anything else I needed. The manager happened to come by (didn't get her name, but she had curly hair and glasses) and she was very pleasant and apologetic. She offered some pizookie coupons which was a nice gesture. I hope she spoke with Janelle about the situation -- she's not going to last long in the service industry if she keeps treating customers that way. Basic respect is a must. Anyway, this place has always been consistent with everything else in the past. Knocking off the stars for Janelle's poor service.

Joanna R.,"San Diego, CA",900,186,169,1.0,6/10/2016,"We have gone here on a Thursday night, around 10 or so, and it was super dead and slow. We sat at the bar, since it was happy hour. The plan was to grab a quick dinner before heading to incahoots... But that obviously didn't happen accordingly....  As we sat, our waiter asked us what we would like to drink. We got 2 beers, a wine, and a soda. Yes I know the bar sometimes lags, but not for 20 mins! So we waited and waited for our drinks to come, and finally they arrive! As soon as they arrived, we ordered appetizers and two mini deep dish pizzas (which were so good, by the way!), but that took 45 minutes to come out! I don't understand how the people next to us got their meals before we did, and we had ordered about 20 minutes before they did!  Half way eating through our pizzas, we decided to get another order of calamari.. (Which was probably a mistake!) Finally we finished our pizzas and our calamari still wasn't out! I guess they had delivered it to the wrong table, (which they still charged us for!)  Long story short- I love BJ's food, but I will not be returning to this location. The service was horrible and no one ever came to our table to see if we ever needed anything. Yes the next location is the Escondido one, which is a drive, but at least their food is bomb and their service is on point!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=40
Cinnie T.,"San Diego, CA",144,123,1543,3.0,7/30/2016,"I still prefer the BJ's located at north county mall further up in Escondido since parking spaces are not as compacted as the lots here. However, this restaurant is still very nice and resembles all the other ones. The ambiance is loud but lively and dim inside.  FOOD: The food is good too, kinda reminds me of a higher-end TGI Fridays. Don't expect the ahi poke ($12) to be traditional poke, it's drenched in soy sauce. The pizza reminded me of Pizza Hut since it was really doughy, but silly good. The chicken Alfredo ($16) is delicious!! But the chicken was dry.  SERVICE: Our waiter was very upbeat and friendly, but they do get pretty busy and forget to come around to check up on you from time to time. I'm not sure if it was because we came late at night, but three of the servers (including ours) were hanging out in the back tables gossiping/talking with their friend... Kinda unprofessional since I was trying to get his attention for the check like three times, but I guess they can do whatever they want.  **if you are celebrating your birthday: you get a free pazookie.

We came on a Sunday night right before Memorial Day after we finished watching X-men. We had said we wanted to get a ""snack."" Which ended up being a craving for pizza and pizzokie. Our waitress told us about a special which we could get a salad, pizza and dessert. We were totally down for that.  We being- two girls and two guys - double date; both pairs got a choice of salad, us the house salad and them the caesar salad, a medium pizza to share (half half was a choice) and then the chocolate cookie with cookies & cream ice cream and cookies & cream whip cream on top for the pizzokie. For drinks, us ladies got the pear cider and the guys both got the snake bite. Pear cider was crisp and bubbly. It tasted the most similar to the pear cider I had at a farmers market back in NY, just more bubbly. The snake bite had a creamy taste with a sweet aftertaste as it also contains pear cider in it according to my boyfriend; to me however it still tasted bitter because of the stout. Total was around $80ish. Would not mind coming back if I was in the neighborhood - we had a lovely time and the restaurant people actually didnt kick us out when they closed.

He literally looked like he had been drinking and when asked by our table if that was the case he replied ""I've been at work since 6am"" which was only about a 7 hour shift with a 30 minute break. Extremely unprofessional which sucks because our server was awesome.  Complete unprofessionalism from a manger, he needs some extra training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=40

After a few more minutes a waitress came over and said it's not my table, she said that our waiter is real busy with the large group, but she can take our drink order.

Another BIG advantage is they are open until 12am during the week and 1am on Fri & Sat which is late for the area, most places close at 9 or 10!      They are often busy, but you can seat yourself in the cocktail area which is convenient during rush hour. Unfortunately if you don't go to cocktail you sometimes have to wait up front for a host to show up to get seated especially during the daytime hours it seems.

I went with the rack of ribs and my girlfriend got the chicken fettuccini Alfredo. The ribs were amazing. They came out cooked to perfection and were not served burnt and dry like some locations (Bj's @ La Jolla). The Alfredo was also delicious with a nice warm dinner roll that was incredibly fluffy.  The service was also great. Our server was the gentleman named James who looked like Conor McGregor. He was kind as well as fast. He refilled our drinks quickly and retrieved condiments such as honey mustard for me when I had requested some. I didn't feel like I was waiting around for anything which was awesome.

This was the first time I've been to this location and I ordered something completely different, and I was happy with the outcome!  My best friend and I each got fruity cocktails that were both pretty, and strong. We shared an appetizer and a burger.

We weren't going to be annoying about it and it wasn't a big deal, but those lemon pepper dry rub wings were so good that we wish we had that last wing.  We shared the bacon-guacamole deluxe burger and it was good. The downfall was that there was no smoked bacon really. Rather than crispy pieces of bacon like in other burgers, there were minimal microscopic pieces mixed in with the guacamole. The thin cut fries were amazing, though.

Sarah had dropped the sash and and my other co-worker saw another person wearing it.

Though she was off, she is still a representative of the restaurant. We requested for the manager, Kody, but he was useless!!  He did not reprimand the thief and allowed her to stay at the bar area without any repercussion. What manager will allow this is unbeknownst to me!! Apparently, stealing and staying at the scene without any consequence is absolutely ok for this facility. Kody's management style is a freakin' joke!!   After the bridal celebration, most of our party of 13 left already and three of us went to the bar. Sara was our bartender and she was awesome too. She said it was the talk of the employee about Gabriela and Sara apologized for her. We thank her and told her it was a nice gesture but Gabriela should be the one apologizing.   I gave this BJ 2 stars: 1 for Lauren and 1 for Sara.

I went to BJ's last Friday evening for Happy Hour with about 8 friends from work.  We sat down in the bar area and waited about 15 mins before a waiter came to take our order.   It took another 10 mins for us to receive our order.   As we were finishing our drinks we started looking for our waiter.  Could not find him.  I spoke to the bartender and he said he just went on break for 30 mins.  I asked if he could send someone over to take our order. 10 mins later another waiter showed up to tell us our waiter is on break and he would be back to take our order.  He showed up about 10 mins later.  So 20 mins later we finally place an order for drinks and food.  10 mins after that we got someone else order of food.  When we finally got our order of food and drinks everyone was so frustrated on the long wait we barely finished our drinks and food.  The bar was not busy at all.  About 7 or 8 tables with people sitting waiting and walking out because of the wait.       They screws up our Check which took additional time to fix.  The entire time we spent at BJ's was a wreck.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=80
Padres F.,"San Diego, CA",0,26,,5.0,5/19/2017,This is a great addition to the area. The service has always been very good and the food is good as well.  The Happy Hour and offerings in the bar area are great for after work or during a game. The open air vibe makes this place really appealing as most people dont want to to sit in a dark restaurant this close to the beach during the summer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=80

Deborah S.,"San Diego, CA",401,180,710,4.0,11/23/2015,"We returned to BJ's yesterday after the Veteran's Day debacle and it was a very different experience. We were seated immediately and our waiter acknowledged us within minutes of being seated. We placed our order of parmesan wings, root beer rib, and mini pepperoni pizzas. I must say everything was delicious.  Parmesan wings - perfectly cooked, crispy yet still juicy with just enough sauce Root beer ribs - moist, tender, tangy and sweet all at the same time Pizza - had a perfect char on the top, large pepperonis and parts of the cheese was crispy. In the middle of the meal the GM came out to apologize for our last encounter and to thank my husband for his service as well as our return to BJ's. It was a great meal with good food, excellent customer service and football.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=80
Jennifer S.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/8/2017,"Yuck, not a great experience. The food was mediocre and overpriced. Disappointing since I could have gone to the Cheesecake Factory for what I paid and had a better meal. Strike 1: The Bloody Mary was bland and the server said they couldn't make it any spicier. Strike 2: The BBQ chicken salad came with almost no dressing on it, and was mostly a huge bowl of lettuce with really salty chicken and skimpy on the other ingredients. It was also missing the green onions, which might have saved it. Definitely didn't look like the picture on the menu.  Tortilla soup was just okay, also salty with two little pieces of avocado thrown in.  Strike 3: Service was really slow and we had to wait 10+ minutes for a kids pizookie after I already paid the check. The server did apologize, but she should have taken the dessert off the check. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong thing, but prob not coming back. I'll stick to my other favorite restaurants in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=80

The manager replied to my survey and invited us back with a gift card.  We love BJ's so it's not like he had to twist our arms. The experience in the prior visit was not enough to keep us away but was enough to make me not leave a review since I knew it wasn't their norm but wanted to let someone, not everyone know what we experienced. We really appreciated that the the manager took the time to reply and apologize. So this visit, we decided to get something different that our usual and we got a Mediterranean pizza, lemon pepper dry rub wings and side salads. Everything was delicious! The service was great and the atmosphere was rowdy and fun due to the SDSU game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=80
Tori O.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",10,9,2,1.0,10/13/2017,"The customer service at this location is awful, the one in La Mesa is WAY better. My mom and I didn't even make it to a table before we walked out it was so bad. Their website says you can call in to put your name on the list, so I called while sitting in the parking lot because it was crazy packed and if the wait was super long we didn't want to wait. Well the lady on the phone said it was only going to be ten minutes for us two and I asked to make sure I could put my name down on the list over the phone. She said yes and that she put us on the list so we walked into the restaurant and sat down to wait. Twenty minutes later we asked her how much longer it would be and turns out she never put us on the list! And then she blamed us for not telling her we were there when we'd literally told her we were walking in over the phone. My mom was so upset with how rude she was we immediately left. Which turned out to be a blessing because we went to Lazy Dog and they're amazing all around! So for future reference if you want BJ's drive to La Mesa, that location has a much better staff, I've never had a bad experience there and I've been going there my whole life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=80

After we questioned this, she half admitted that they didn't feel like installing the ""keyboard"" for the card machine, which would have made it work.  LAZY and ridiculous.

Calvin N. H.,"San Diego, CA",722,300,1910,3.0,10/15/2015,"I've been to various BJ's on many occasions. I've frequented this particular location a handful of times. Parking can be a pain depending on when you go. During peak hours on weekends, expect a long wait. There's a Barnes and Noble nearby to kill time if the wait is excessively long. One person will likely have to take one for the team and wait at BJ's in case your table is ready. This location is pretty spacious with indoor and outdoor dining options. They have big screen televisions so you can catch sports action. Food is generally pretty good. I'd rate it 4/5. I've tried pasta, entrees, burgers, pizzas, salads, appetizers, and dessert. Service can be hit or miss... pretty inconsistent. I've had anywhere from 2-4 stars out of 5 in service. I've noticed larger parties get better overall service. This makes sense because their ticket will come out to a larger dollar amount (versus a table for 2-3) and this correlates to the tip. For this reason, there have been times water and drinks haven't been refilled, it's taken forever to get boxes, utensils, the bill and so on. But I look over at the bigger table and the server is all up on that table like Barney Stinson on a hot blonde. I get it, but it doesn't mean I have to like it. There are plenty of places I've frequented where customer service is much more consistent and I don't see favoritism because of group size. Atmosphere is okay, pretty standard. This place is clean, spacious, and has plenty of televisions. I'd score it a 3 out of 5. My last few visits, service hasn't been good. As a result, I can only rate this place a 3... food is the only reason this score isn't lower. I'll return (if friends or family are in the mood), but I won't be expecting great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=80

Amanda N.,"San Diego, CA",570,241,68,2.0,5/23/2016,"I probably wouldn't keep coming back here if it wasn't for the pizookie. I've come here twice in the last few weeks and did not have a good experience either time.  The first time I came was around 10pm on a Sunday night. My friend and I decided to sit in the bar area to take advantage of the late night happy hour specials. The server took awhile to bring menus and when she did she plopped them in front of us and walked away, no greeting, smile, or anything. When she FINALLY came back to take our order we had some questions as it wasn't clear what the happy hour specials were. Her response ""look somewhere in that smaller menu they are in there somewhere"" and walked away. We finally placed our orders. We both ordered pizza. It took 45 minutes for us to get our food, and the place was not busy. Once the pizza was delivered no one ever came back to check on us. We had to flag servers down to ask for the box and check. The pizza was good, but the service was horrible. I decided to give this place a try again since I remember BJ's being better than that. Second time around I came on a Sunday afternoon. Decided to sit at the bar area again to watch the bball game. This time the service was ok, but the food was terrible! I ordered a steak cooked to medium. When the steak arrived it was burnt crisp and was so rubbery I could barely cut it open. I said something to the server so he said he would have another steak brought out. The next one that came out was cooked medium well to well done. I decided at this point to just suck it up and eat it. The meal was comped but I would have much rather paid and eaten a decent tasting meal than get a horrible meal for free.

Holly S.,"San Diego, CA",8,3,2,4.0,1/26/2017,The only reason I did not give a 5 is due to noise level (we could not hear everyone at our own table). The food was incredible I will definitely be coming back. I ordered the Great White Deep Dish Pizza. Great flavor and very eye appetizing. My kids really appreciated getting a (free) kids starter it was a perfect little gold over until food (bread knots and fruit).  If you can get James he was amazing and is great with kids.

I felt sick once I was finished but it went away. The next day I woke up to my stomach hurting, once again it went away. Mid day I was throwing up all the pasta and chicken! I GOT FOOD POISONING! They brought out the food really quick but now that I look back at it, it was so quick they probably under cooked the chicken, if I could give no star I deff would. I'm going to call corporate on this place, they obviously aren't following the rules. Now I'm here puking my life away.  UPDATE: The management team contacted me by email saying they would like to give me a gift card and if I could call them to resolve the issue. I called multiple times and never got an answer.

My boyfriend enjoyed the jalapeño burger with fries. BJ's is also a brewery so you can enjoy some of their brews. They have outdoor seating with a fire pit and tv's. The inside is a little dark but nicely decorated.  Parking lot gets filled up quick so I parked in the back of the parking lot. The walk up wasn't bad at all.

Come to find out today was her first day serving on her own. I waited to speak to a manager after we finished eating and got our bill because I strongly believe in giving credit where credit is due. Shannon provided us with hands down the best service we've ever had at any BJs location. Not only was she quick, but she was polite, extremely friendly and caring. I used to be a server and I know when someone is BSing too much for a tip. I didn't get that vibe from her even a little bit and I really appreciate that. She was genuinely sweet and cared about our experience - on top of everything. My best friend and I have BJs as our go to place to eat and if she's there, we'll definitely be asking for Shannon as our server from now on. It also meant a lot that her manager was just as excited to hear my positive feedback on Shannon and she said she couldn't wait to write my compliment in her reports.

I had the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. The broccoli cheese soup was very good, house salad was boring but fresh, and while I definitely didn't love how thick the lentil soup was, the flavor was good. So what's the problem? Service was SO slow. That little lunch took a full 60 minutes and I had a conference to get back to.   I do want to come back to try some of the entrees, but will definitely be keeping in mind that it will be a bit of a longer visit than most restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=20

I work across the street and it took 1 1/2 for our entire meal ( only soup and salad) I'm not sure if they were under staffed or if it was because we chose to sit outside but it took a lot longer than usual considering we were on our hour lunch break.

Anthony S.,"Long Beach, CA",288,49,205,2.0,5/21/2017,"Normally I like BJ's restaurants, but this particular one is average at best. My last visit was yesterday when I was very hungry and I wanted to watch the Warriors game after a long graduation ceremony. I learned from my last visit that this location does not have tables in the main dining room that can seat parties greater than 6. For this reason, my family had to sit at a high table in the bar area. The table was sticky, and so the busboy wiped the table for us with a wet cloth, but that did not help at all. The waiter was very anti-social and seemed like he hated his life. When taking orders he stood on one side of the table. When he couldn't hear one of us, he did not move around to them so that he can. Instead, he stayed in one spot and spoke with a little bit of an attitude to get someone to speak up. After submitting our order, he told us he was going on break and made what seemed like a passive-aggressive joke about it. The person covering our table while he was on break was much nicer and was really attentive. Despite the below-average service from our previous waiter, we still gave a 20% tip. When you are hungry, food usually tastes really good, though the food here was just decent. It is not the same quality of other BJ's restaurants. However, the pizookie is good no matter which BJ's you choose to go to. As stated before, we came yesterday to watch the Warriors game. A lot of TVs had the game on but the only one i could actually see fully had the duck's game on. After the duck's game, nobody was looking at that TV anymore, so it was requested to be changed to the Warriors game. Someone agreed to change the channel, but did not, so we asked again. By the time we were done eating and paid the check, over 30 minutes have passed and the channel did not change. As for parking, the lot is almost always full so you have to walk a short distance. Majority of the spaces are for compact cars, some spaces acknowledged it, but some did not. Luckily, we found a parking spot on the Barnes and nobles side, which had bigger parking spaces.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=20

Another thing when we completely ran out of water no waiter passed us by and none came by to bring water until our waitress came to our table and we had to ask her for water.

My BF was a little tired of eating Asian food and wanted something American. I suggested BJ's. American food and beer? Done.  It was not crowded at all for a Sunday night. Plenty of seating in the dining room, the bar area, and the outside patio. Initially I wanted to sit at the outdoor patio of course, because it was outside and there was a giant round fire pit, but it was a bit too cool outside for me, even with the space heaters, so we decided on a booth in the dining room. It was the middle booth, and had a view of the whole restaurant and several TV's.  For their hand crafted sodas and beer, I chose the root beer and black cherry to try. The beer, my BF started with the Abbey normal, and then wanted to try the Tatonka Stout, but they didn't have it, so he had the PM Porter instead. He liked both. As for the sodas, you can try a different soda each refill (which are free), I personally like the root beer the best.  We got the clam chowder to start. It was really good. If you like a lot of bread, I suggest getting the chowder in a bread bowl. I got the Grilled Chicken Pasta for my entree. It was good. The pasta was not drenched in cream, broccoli was steamed well, small soft pieces, and the chicken was a bit dry. I would've liked more chicken and broccoli for the pasta ratio. It was topped with 2 pieces of toasted bread. That was a bit dry as well, and asked for some marinara sauce, the sauce was perfect for the bread, but watch out, it has a kick! He decided to get the 12"" Gourmet Five meat Deep dish pizza. It had meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, ham and salami. I don't care for a lot of bread for pizza, but it was delicious! Our server was nice, helpful, and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=200
Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",235,920,2051,4.0,5/8/2014,"It's a chain restaurant, so you know what you're getting. The place was packed when we initially stopped by, but neither of us wanted to sit around waiting for an hour, so we decided to hit up the nearby Target to get some errands out of the way before circling back for dinner.   I'm glad we did that (not that the Target experience was great, because it really wasn't) - by the time we got back to the restaurant, there was no wait. We checked in and got seated at a booth right away, though the dining room was packed and loud.   Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We both ordered drinks and the calamari to start, before going through the menu. I decided to try a new item, the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, while my husband went with his usual order, the shrimp tacos.   It took a while for the calamari to be brought to our table, and I have to wonder if it's because they decided to fry the heck out of it. The little squid pieces were so deeply fried that they were almost burnt, and they were inedible. It's a shame, too, because we both really had a hankering for calamari.   The main dishes came out not too long after, and I admit, when I saw our waitress walking towards our table with the plates in hand, I wanted to laugh. The plates looked so tiny! Yes, we both ordered off of the ""Lighter Fare"" menu, but come on! The plates looked almost laughably small in her hands.   Still, once I started to tuck in, I realized that there was enough food on the plate to satiate me. The little pita tacos were interesting. The chicken was chopped into bite-sized pieces, and the pita was piled high with everything - chicken, diced tomatoes, cucumbers and herbs. It was supposed to come with a sauce for dipping, but they barely provided anything. If I order it again, I'd ask for extra sauce, because the ""taco"" itself can be a bit dry. The other thing it came with was a bulgur salad, which was delicious. The salad itself was a tiny serving, but it was loaded with cheese, tomato, cucumber and herbs, and it was pretty filling.   Of course, once we were done, we decided that our meal would be incomplete without a Pizookie. They had a couple new flavors out, and we decided on the salted caramel version. What can I say...I'm a sucker for salted caramel anything!   When they brought it to us, I thought, ""Well, that's the saddest looking Pizookie I've seen yet."" The tower of ice cream had already melted into the cookie, so it wasn't as grand and tall as it usually is. But, that didn't mean that it wasn't delicious. Boy, howdy, was it yummy!   All in all, it was another good night of good, cheap food from a chain we're coming to enjoy. The only downer was the well-done calamari.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=200

I don't understand why there was no one there to greet or settle us down. But I also understand it's was not only friday but ""good"" friday still very unprofessional..

My chicken Alfredo was ok not the best pasta was over cooked which made it a bit hard & crunchy o.O. After waiting and waiting for our server to come by. Literally we had to ask someone else for service. -.-  not to mention our drinks were not being refilled. We decided to use the restrooms since we had a long way ahead of us.. No darn toilet paper!!! Ah I was ready to leave at this point. I made sure to let someone know about that situation. Not sure If they followed up. Walking out with 2 boxes on my hands..

Linda D.,"San Diego, CA",675,594,4293,2.0,2/5/2014,"Painful sums it up.  I truly like BJ's. You could almost call me a fan. However, I had a horrendous experience on my last visit. I don't like bad service. However, ZERO service is beyond me. On my most recent visit, I actually had the opportunity to have what I could say was quite horrible service. I was sitting in the bar area as I usually do when I come here. And on this particular occasion my table went through 2 and almost three servers. The first two were great but had to stop serving my table due to schedule and shift changes. Not sure if the third person was not informed that they were supposed to cover our table, but she clearly knew to serve every other table in our section but mine. If anyone at our table wanted anything, we actually got better service by walking over to the bartender and ordering food and drinks. The only person who stopped by our table to see if we needed anything was the person bussing tables. This kind of service would have made me walk out of the restaurant and I wanted too, however we were watching a playoff football game and wanted to stay and enjoy ourselves.  After being ignored completely from before the National Anthem to halftime -which is well over an hour, I had to complain to the manager. This is the first time that I have ever had to complain at a restaurant about piss poor service. You can't even call it service when you are NOT being served at all. A switch over is staff happened on a previous occasion that resulted in having our table ignored and not well taken card of. TWO THUMBS DOWN!! This kind service puts a bad taste in my mouth and makes me not want to go back. However I will be fair and say that I will go back and hope that I don't have this kind of service from there ever again. This place is a great place most of the time.

He had food recommendations that were honest and spot on, he even went out of his way to split up a few checks for us. And with people staggering in, he did a great job of grabbing drinks and orders and food all at the same time. He kept a smile on through all of this chaos and I really appreciated it.

David P.,"Anaheim, CA",132,223,817,3.0,12/16/2014,"This was one of the better BJ's in San Diego compared to the one in La Jolla. This location was much bigger since it's a stand alone and had many more TV screens for the sports enthusiast. We came after the Chargers Broncos game so there were a lot of Broncos fans relishing in their victory while watching the SNF game. I liked the elevated seats they had since it really gives you a grand view of the entire restaurant. The service was a bit slow, but I can understand since they were packed after the football game. It irked me that it took 20 mins for a waiter to come to us and ask for orders. The waiter seemed like a college student so he didn't have that waiter-ish personality. We didn't get offered water until we asked for some after getting our cocktails. There were times when I tried to flag down other waiters for service, but they seemed like chickens with their heads cut off since everyone was running around. They wouldn't make eye contact with you if you yelled to get their attention so they can move past you asap. I do commend them on offering a complimentary pizookie since it was my gf's birthday month. The pizzokie was delicious, as always. As for the cocktails, we go the Strawberry Splash and I got the Peach Sangria. The SS was very sweet, but apparently has grey goose. The peach sangria was tasteful with a hint of wine as an after taste. For entrees, we got a White Pie and Parmesan Crusted Chicken. A tid bit to everyone when they say ""white pie"", they don't actually leave out the marinara. They put marinara on the pizza and drizzle alfredo sauce over the pie. We were a bit disappointed since white pie always meant alfredo sauce sans marinara. The parm chicken was delicious and I could always come back for more. Overall, it was a decent sunday night meal that was even better with the sports atmosphere. IF you don't like noise or sports guys screaming during dinner, then dont come after a big sports game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=200

Unfortunately 2 of 3 of the things ordered were unsatisfactory. The Brussell Sprouts were completely burned and could not be eaten at all. I had ordered the chicken parmesan dinner and the chicken had an almost rubbery texture. It was so bad I couldn't eat even half of it (I order thus dish all the time and know what it's supposed to taste like). We called the manager on duty Andy and she refunded the Brussell Sprouts saying it wasn't the first complaint of the night. But proceeded to argue with us about the chicken stating that it didn't make sense and tried to justify that it probably wasn't as good because we ordered take out (pretty much discouraging us from ever buying take out from here again). The food was eaten 15 minutes after we picked it up. As far as customer service I never expect someone to argue with me about the quality of food. If I were in the restaurant I could have shown them the lack on quality of chicken (I tossed more than  half of it out). On a side note the pasta my boyfriend ordered was delicious. I would probably give this place a 4 or 5 if I was going off previous experiences as we dine here often but after tonight's experience and being talked to the way we were about something so easy for the restaurant correct I give a solid 2 and will probably avoid this restaurant for a while.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=220

Once she asked for our drink order, we both ordered coffee, and she explained to us in a very short rude manner that the coffee machine was broken. Finding that a bit odd that a huge restaurant has one coffee machine, we just stuck with water and kept our mouths shut. We proceeded to order because after waiting 25 minutes for a server, we were hungry! After she took our order, her attitude was extremely fake and nauseating to the point where I was nervous about our food being tampered with.  We waited about 40 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, they had forgot an entire portion of my entree in the back and had to bring it out later. The food was mediocre at best.

The Cajun Pasta was good; it even got better with age--I liked it more after it cooled and the sauce thickened up a bit. The portion size was perfect. I could have cleaned my plate had I not taken down a beer in the process.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=220
Conrad R.,"San Diego, CA",1353,726,15270,3.0,12/5/2013,"It went pretty much as expected.  I like the layout of the space. They did a nice reconstruction of the space since taking over the former Maria Maria spot at Hazard Center. Good sight lines, and traffic flow between tables moves nicely, with accessibility from one end to the other. Neat firepit at the patio. Service today was very good for being recently open and having a new staff on board. Our waiter checked on us regularly, and I wasn't worried about overhearing the trainer give some reminders and coaching on the side. It's encouraging to see that they make the effort to strive for quality customer service. A nice lunch. I tried the boneless buffalo wing appetizer, but I don't know...kinda plain for me. They have better app options. Maybe it was the coating. We shared a deep dish pizza. Hearty toppings, cheesy bites, good crust. Very filling and we took home the extra slices that I snacked on later. You can never have too many snacks when the sports are on. Of course, we got a Pizookie©. It's just one of those simple desserts that we usually don't pass on: smooth vanilla ice cream atop a warm, soft chocolate chip cookie right from the oven. The kiddo definitely approves, and she's the expert on sweets. BJ's is the latest brewhouse restaurant chain to drop in Mission Valley and they'll come along nicely once they take off the training wheels.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=220
Raymond F.,"Jacksonville, FL",29,67,81,4.0,4/4/2015,"I went twice but the first time was for craft beer while waiting on a movie to start near by. The next time was to actually eat at 11pm. I ordered the their rib eye with green beans and clam chowder with a sour dough loaf. For a drink I ordered their clementine crush, which was good but apparently contained alcohol and I couldn't taste it at all but I wasn't in the mood for alcohol so it guess it worked out. Their green beans were steamed but didn't taste like anything but it didn't bother me because I'm used to raw green beans. The rib eye suck for the most part , I got it well done (as I always get) and it was just boring. The best part of the meal was clam chowder with the sourdough loaf. That's the kind of dish I would go out of my way to get, especially if I have been having a bad day.  TL;DR/// The clam chowder wit the sourdough loaf  hit  hard a fuh.

That's the standard in which is the BJ's I've known since my first BJ's experience at the Grossmont Center location and then at the Moreno Valley location and THEN at the North County location. We chose their Sweet Pig deep dish pizza and their Sesame Chicken Salad. Looked and tasted amazing. On the other hand, my complaint is location. I don't complain about parking much, but this location SUCKS for parking. I am excited about there being a BJ's close by to where we live because I get a chance to have their BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich or their pizza more often now. They have a huge selection of pizza and now offer hand tossed for those who aren't crazy for deep dish. What is wrong with deep dish, btw?! Blah, I definitely will be back for sure.

I don't even think there was actual squid in the dish because all I could taste was greasy breading. My husband ordered sliders and mozzarella sticks both of which he said were okay.

I don't know if someone called out so she had a larger section than normal but she was covering the entire patio alone and although it was 8pm the outdoor area had no open tables.

My mini pizookie was free for my birthday which was nice, they refused to sing, but I was mostly joking when I asked. It wouldn't be my first choice for going out for dinner, but for every once in awhile its a fun spot. My primary complaint is their avocado eggrolls have a spicy mayo like substance and its overpowering! Its like they cover up the fact that there is little to no avocado in them by putting so much spicy stuff in them I cant taste anything else! I would personally rather go to Cheesecake Factory for their avocado eggrolls, which are much tastier.

We ended up sitting outside, all squished together, cause the table sat 6 and there where 8 of us.  Anyways we got the deal where it came with an appetizer (salad or soup), medium deep dish pizza and pizookie for $25.  So I got the Caesar salad, worst salad ever. There where barely any dressing and the romaine was soggy, not fresh. And my boyfriend got the broccoli and cheddar soup, it was super salty because they dump a lot of cheddar cheese on top of the thick soup.  Now for the deep dish pizza, we order mushroom and pepperoni which took forever for them to be done with because they made pepperoni and sausage instead. But we weren't told that they had messed up on our pizza and had started all over till 10 mins after our friends had gotten their deep dish. So by the time we got our pizza everyone had finished eating. Didn't enjoy the pizz because the crust was super soggy and super bland.  For the pizookie we got the cookies and cream. It was yummy. It had a brownie at the bottom with vanilla ice cream on top.  Also we tried their calamari, was not impress. It was super dry and brunt. And the mozzarella stickers where good. Perfectly fried.

Jen R.,"San Diego, CA",186,88,116,4.0,8/29/2015,"Terrific place to dine at before heading out to a Charger game (if you are taking the trolley to go to the stadium).  Great atmosphere, yummy food, and friendly service! ATMOSPHERE: Open seating around the upper bar area and patio instead of waiting on the guest list for a table in the lower dining area.  Plus there are plenty of TVs in the open seating areas if you are a sports fan. FOOD: On a hot day, order the Watermelon and Feta Salad!  With the sweetness of the watermelon and the saltiness of the feta cheese, this unique pairing compliments each other so well!  So refreshingly delicious, I wouldn't mind eating 3-4 servings of this salad! Deep dish pizza here is legit.  I'm not a deep dish pizza fan because there is too much crust and bread involved, but BJ's version made me actually like theirs.  The crust is golden and crisp, and the bread base is fluffy and light.  I ordered the Gourmet Five Meat pizza (mini size) because I'm a meat lover pizza kind of gal.  The mini portion will feed 1-2 people.  My friend and I ate two slices each and were getting pretty full. Have a small appetite?  Try the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms filled with BJ's spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, red onions, Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs, drizzled with a zesty lemon pesto sauce.  Nice little bites to snack on. SERVICE: Our server, Jennifer H, was super nice and friendly.  She had given us her personal experience on the food we selected when she was taking our order. She lett us know we are in for a wonderful treat.  And... she was right!  The food was very tasty!  She also came by frequently to make sure if we needed anything, checked on our food order (when we were waiting) and refilled our drinks.  She provided excellent service.  Thank you, my fellow Jen! CONS: 1.) The menu is like a novel.  A heavy book with so many pages of food and drink choices.  It was overwhelming trying to figure out what to eat (pizza, sandwich, burger, pasta, specialty entrees, salads, and the list going on forever it seems).  My friend had to take a few minutes to really figure out what we were hungry for. 2.) It took a bit of time to receive our food and drinks.  Probably because the kitchen has so many different kinds of food to make for their customers.  However, our server Jen was awesome proactively checking up on our order periodically without us having to ask. FINAL THOUGHTS: I think this is my new favorite pre-gaming spot before I head over to Qualcomm stadium for an event or Charger game for some great tasty bites. But I'll make sure to give a bit more time for eating so that we are not late to any events. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=180
Cody S.,"San Diego, CA",134,119,285,2.0,4/15/2015,"I love deep dish pizza and I love breweries, so BJ's seemed like a match made in heaven! Unfortunately the first two times I went here I left pretty disappointed. The pizza was thick, but it was also bland, soggy and seemed kind of old. The appetizer of avocado egg rolls, despite having fresh avocado, fell along the same lines. Something was off but I couldn't place my finger on it. The next time I went was after a Charger's game and decided to skip the pizza, ordering a chicken sandwich. Yet again, I got a lack of flavor and the chicken seemed kind of rubbery. The saving grace of the meal was the Pizookie, a fresh baked-to-order cookie that is topped with ice cream. It's super indulgent and easily their best offering. The PIzookie was tasty but what made the entrees so lifeless and boring? I finally learned the truth while mentioning my experiences to a friend that used to work at one. Nearly everything is FROZEN and reheated. Where some chain restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory may be gluttonous but prepare everything fresh, BJ's pulls everything out of a bag and sticks most in a microwave. Very little is done on-site and the flavor shows it. I'm definitely done ordering meals here, but craft beer and a freshly baked cookie may still do the trick during an occasional game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=180

bzribee b.,"San Diego, CA",0,61,,3.0,6/30/2017,"This was my first visit.  I went with a small group of friends.  BJ's has a very lengthy menu and it was Happy Hour and quite noisy, but we were seated quickly and our waitress was great.  I got the ""New Roasted Shrimp Peruvian Quinoa  Bowl"" which I thought was absolutely delicious.  My friends got some Starter Salads (Portabello/Asparagus and Twisted BLT) and liked those very much.  We also got various Small Bites which were not as well received.  First, they are much smaller than the menu pictures would have you think.  The Garlic Parmesan Roasted Carrots were very good but hardly worth $4.95.  The Roasted Golden Beets were good and the Turmeric Roasted Cauliflower was okay--all had more spices (heat) than some of my group expected.  We all hated the Sauteed Garlic Spinach Kale which was none of those:  barely any greens noticeable, no garlic and mostly cabbage, carrots and vinegar?  It tasted more like a warm German Cole Slaw than the yummy sauteed garlic spinach dish we were expecting (like you'd get in a Thai, or Italian restaurant).  Other than the vinegar (?) it had no real flavor and was very, very disappointing and nothing like the menu description.  I would name it Flavorless Steamed Cabbage with Teeny Bits of Other Colors.  DON'T get it.  We tried the Lentil Soup which didn't have much flavor, either.  It was quite thick which we would've liked if it had flavor. Our waitress was great with us but didn't really check back with us for refills, corrections, so on.  That would've been appreciated.  I think we came at a shift change but a little more attention from someone would've been appreciated.  Still, she was patient and helpful when around.

He suggested certain foods and mostly everything came out on time, hot, and tasty. The avocado eggrolls  and spinach and artichoke dip was good. I ordered a thin crust veggie pizza for the first time and it was tasty as well. My coworkers had the Caesar salad specially made with mostly kale and the bbq chicken salad (I believe).  Drinks were good. I ordered a drink inspired by one of the employees. It was half pina colada with blended strawberries in it. Whatever the name, it was very good!

Cam J.,"San Diego, CA",85,3,,1.0,2/24/2017,"I've lived in San Diego for a year and have always driven past this restaurant, saying to myself ""I've never been there, I need to go try it!"" Well a few nights ago, I did just that. My friend and I went on Wednesday night, where they apparently were doing some kind of $10 burger night, so it was BUSY. The hostess at the front told us there would be a 15 minute wait if we wanted a table, but any seating at the bar was free for the taking. Amazing, we didn't have to wait for a table! I was wrong. We promptly perused the bar area for seating and found a booth that was being cleared, cleaned, and set up. So we swooped in and sat down. Not even a second later, a host comes up behind us and very rudely says, ""Uhh... I was saving this booth for someone else...."" to which I replied, ""Well the girl at the front told us it was open seating at the bar, so we decided to take the next booth."" That didn't seem to mull over well with him, because he didn't say a word. Anyway, about 30 seconds later, we find another booth a little further down and decided to sit there. Upon sitting, I just happened to glance over at the host station, where the host who so rudely spoke to us, was pointing us out, rolling his eyes, and the hostess girl joining in and shaking her head. I mean, come on, we all know how to complain about customers, and it isn't in plain view. If I wasn't already annoyed, I was at that point... After looking over the menu, we decided to order one of their $10 burger specials of the night. I ordered the Portobello Swiss Burger, medium-well. When I received the burger, it was bright pink in the middle. I'm not the type to complain, so I just dealt with what I was given. But as soon as I bit into the burger, I was overwhelmed with salt. Now, I'm a smoker, so usually I can't taste that much saltiness, but WOW... this was insane. I can only imagine what it would have tasted to someone who doesn't smoke... Yuck. So after some inspection of the burger and trying to figure out WHY it was so salty... I discovered it was the portobello mushroom caps. I just can't understand why in the hell someone would salt a mushroom cap THAT much... Makes no sense. So I ripped apart my burger, piece by piece, and decided STILL... that I would not complain... until now. I walked into this restaurant with an extremely open mind, having never been here before, but the rude staff and whatever the hell that damn kitchen staff (cooks, expos, whatever) are doing... it's going to cause people like me to leave a terrible review about terrible service and terrible food. If you're wanting burgers, I honestly suggest you go to In-N-Out. Surprisingly enough, their food is less salty and more cooked through than here at BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=120

Art C.,"San Diego, CA",77,48,12,3.0,11/9/2016,"I've eaten at BJ's all over the country and this review will be a culmination of those visits. If you've been to one of them, you've been to all of them. I will be highlighting this location since it was the latest BJ's I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Location: BJ's is located off of Frazee Road near Barnes and Nobles. I've come here during lunch and dinner and each time wasn't too busy. Plenty of tables both inside and outdoors. A lot of bar space as well if you want to watch the games or enjoy happy hour. You shouldn't have a problem with parking either. 8/10 Service: The service has always been spot on at this location. Our server (whoever it may be) was very helpful and had impeccable timing when we needed something. The food always came out within 15-20 minutes and the drinks came quicker than you can say ""LETS GO LAKERS"". Some of the best service I've experienced at a chain restaurant. 9/10 Happy hour: This is usually when I come here. Their happy hour runs from 3p-7p Monday- Friday and 10p- close Sunday- Thursday. Half off mini pizzas, dollar off your beer, and 2 bucks off appetizers. Not bad for a HH but then again, whose gonna say no to BOGO mini pizzas? 7/10 Food: The menu at BJ's covers anything you would want. They are known for their pizza but they also have plenty of other choices you can pick from. The last time I came here I ordered a Classic Cheeseburger w/ french fries and an order of the fried calamari. The burger wasn't anything special but I keep my tastes simple when I drink beer. The calamari was ok. The breading flakes off and there are only a few big pieces of squid. Again tho, simple tastes when I partake in the game of drink. 6/10 Drinks: BJ's is well known for their craft beer. I have enjoyed their Jeremiah Red for as long as I been drinking. It's an Irish style ale with a refreshing, fruity bite. I used to get pitchers of this beer... ahhh the good old days. They also offer their version of a hefeweizen which will quench your thirst. 8/10 This restaurant got 3/5 stars from me because there simply isn't anything ""special"" about BJ's. Yes they have great craft beer and decent food but nothing on the menu leaves me craving more of it. Overall, good place to watch a game and have a few dollar-off-beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=120

Our drink order wasn't even taken for over 10 minutes. And when we had asked for someone to help us, he had the nerve to argue with us when he came to the table about how long we even sat there. We ordered at the same time. Food was dropped off by other people and again he, Bryan was yet to be seen. I literally had to raise my hand and get someones attention just to get some damn refills. So now we're done 30 mins later and dude has still yet to even look our damn way. I saw a guy in a button up at the cpu so I called him over and low and behold he was the manager Cody.. So I proceeded to tell him the entire situation and asked for my check. He basically gave me a fake apology and that was it.. he brought me the bill and didn't even take a 5 cent discount off. No wonder the service was so bad even the manager was super sub par. I swear I was appalled that I had this bad of a time at bjs which I love bjs and have even become a regular at the other location.

Anita W.,"San Diego, CA",40,25,2,1.0,3/5/2017,"Generally, I don't review franchised restaurants only because it's more about the ""cha-ching"" than about the quality of food. But last nights meal with my boyfriend (aka date night) was incredibly underwhelming and to simply put it, the equivalent to really bad sex. Now, if I can preface my review, service wasn't bad at all. Our servers were fantastic, but the cook that night didn't any f**ks and it showed in the food.  We started off with the calamari, which was ehhh. Marinara was a tad bland but manageable. Side note: I think at that point, we should've just called it quits. My boyfriend is all about the pizzas, regardless of where we go. He's a self-proclaimed pizza connoisseur, so he got the deep dish sausage pizza and I had the BBQ bison burger. Now the last time I was there, I organized a work function hosted by BJ's and they complete delivered; food was bomb! My bf has never been to a BJ's so when I told him about my work function they hosted, he was excited.  Chicago natives would started a riot at the pathetic sight of the deep dish pizza that was served. I'm talking about doughy, thick, bland sausages, with a splash of cheese and a sprinkle of tomato sauce. We should've just picked up a Mama Celeste and asked the cook to heat up the oven. Cue my meal: I had asked for a side of fries with my burger since it only came with coleslaw. Now, when I usually order a burger, I'm asked how would I like it cooked. Didn't happen tonight and that should've been a red flag. My burger looked so sad; saturated in BBQ sauce, thin slice of emaciated lettuce, sprinkle of what looked like pico de gallo (not really sure about the connection there), and what thought I was suppose to be coleslaw but in turn was a pile of cabbage....THATS IT! I flagged down the server and asked if there was suppose to be a dressing. Looking kind of embarrassed, he comes back with a vinaigrette??? Huh????? I'm so confused at this point. Isn't coleslaw suppose to be creamy??? Not tangy!?  So disappointed. We had left overs but there was no way in hell I was letting that crap take up space in my fridge. Maybe the cook was having a bad night, I really don't know.

Mine came back raw... (Yes I understand there is an element of raw to this dessert...) However, this was way too raw to enjoy. And of course since my server didn't come back to ask if we were enjoying our dessert we had to flag down another server to ask if we could have another one. When the new pizookie came it was just as raw as the first one. When the server (I believe it was ""CAMERON P"" the name of the server on my receipt) came back.. Instead of asking if it came back to my liking, she handed me the bill. Even though my pizookie was obviously not being eaten.

I'm trying to watch what I eat so it was really hard not to order dessert because there were lots of amazing looking treats on the menu as well.  The location is very central, in Mission Valley, and there is ample parking in the public lot right in front of the restaurant.  We had great service our waitress was very friendly and checked on us plenty of times during our visit.  I will definitely be back to try some of the other delicious looking salads they had on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=280
Temple R.,"San Diego, CA",6,41,46,4.0,11/1/2015,"Came here  on my sisters 28th birthday. To start, it was busy, the hostess told us to try to find a table in the bar area. Can we know a wait for an actual table? Is there even anything available in the bar area? I had her go check before she sent us over there.  We ended up splitting a community table with some folks. Our server cody or casey,i cant remember what his name was, was very attentive, and kinda had a jersey accent. He checked Id's and saw it was my sisters birthday and made her feel very special. He really knew the menu and helped us pick out some food, then he made sure the kitchen brought out a dessert for my sisters birthday.

That's was ok. Probably won't order ever again. Their pizza is super thick so be prepared to be full. Bathrooms were horrible.

I was there to help a friend out with their fundraiser and the person helping me was able to direct my portion of the money to the right fund. :)  I just ordered something simple, the veggie and goat cheese flatbread and the corn fitters. It took about 15mins for my order which I expected and while she was training the new waitstaff, was showing her some great customer service tips and skills (you go girl!)  The food though, was eh. Wasn't impressed but than again for a rushed out the door job, it was edible. The flatbread pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom and the veggies were unevenly dispersed which most of the veggies were in the middle and the side pieces were just cheese. The corn fritters were a sad mess of burnt balls. Since the dish was to-go, they had to separate the sauce, the fritters and just dumped some bacon, corn and shallots on the bottom of the plate. They couldn't just put it in a little sauce cup like the dipping sauce? Sheesh.

NEVER AGAIN!  STAY AWAY!   My friend and I checked into the hostess station for a table, they told us it would be 5-10 minutes, we punched in a phone number for a text when the table was ready.  In the meantime, we sat at a table in the bay area, at the edge of the patio.  We sat there waiting waiting waiting for a server too come to us to take a drink order..nothing...time passed, no server..couldn't even see one in the area...20 min later still nothing.  Snagged a bus boy that was clearing a table next to us and he promised to get a server for us.  He walked over to the server station and told them we had not been approached for service at all.  They all turned, looked at us..spoke among each other but still nothing.. The bus boy returned, finished wiping that table and said he was going to get us a manager, which he did.   The manager came over..apologized for the overlook and asked if we knew what we wanted to which we responded that we didn't know..We had no menus, no napkins, nothing.  He brought some over shortly.  We still had no text for a table so when he came back with the menus we saw that a table was being cleared in the patio area and would just take that table instead.  He seemed displeased or annoyed but followed us over and handed us the menus and left with our drink order. Shortly after a guy shows us and said he is going to be our server..We review the menu and place our orders..still no drinks, no water, nothing.. 20 min later or drinks arrive, a couple of min after our food.  I ordered fish and chips..My friend a burger and fries.  He dumps the food off and disappears.  The fish was so fried that it looked like they refried some fish they had laying around..hopefully not leftovers from another plate.  It was very dark brown..pretty much charred to the point of the fish inside dissolving. We had no napkins, no eating utensils, no condiments and we sat there dumbfounded looking at each other like wth!!  Are you kidding me!!

Russ U.,"San Jacinto, CA",342,20,19,1.0,1/16/2017,"Wow where do I even start. We went to San Diego for an evening of getting out of town and having some fun; approx 90 min drive away.  This was our 1st stop to get some dinner and meet up with friends.  We arrived and found easy parking and did what alot of people do after a long drive.  It was approx 9pm and the men's room was just downright gross.  Informed hostess when we checked in. We were seated pretty promptly, so they were good there. Unfortunately, as I started to assault their phone book of a menu, I felt a huge drip on my back (it had been raining/pouring all day and night) and got up to look at the floor and see how wet it was etc; as it was clear to me from the moment the drop hit me where it had come from (a leaky roof).  The hostess came and asked if we wanted to move tables, hah.  I told her ""yea that would be great I don't want to be sitting at the low point of the roof where the water is all pooling when it decides to give in and collapse.  So we moved. Waited about 10 more minutes at new table for waiter to come by.  Clearly either this guy was new, sick, beat from working a long shift, or maybe helping taste test new batches of brew because he was just OFF.  Had to repeat everything, yea it was a lil loud in there, but we all spoke clearly with adequate volume for everyone else at the table to hear.  Wife's drink (tokyo tea) was watery like the ice had melted in the cup before they made the drink; my drink was wrong - lol batting 1000.  We got our orders for food in approx half hour after first being seated at leak table, terrible time conversion but by now they were slow so no urgency to turn the table I guess. Food came out slow, talking nearly 20 min from time of order.  Friends got chicken salads, the chicken was cut into weird chunks.  We have all seen where they cut the chicken into strips for visual appeal, it was not an attempt at that (lol the chicken also had no grill marks); it was just lazily diced too big - they goto bj's often (the destination was their pick not ours) and pointed out the chicken; we would have never known it was ""different"".  Wife got the Parmesan chicken; the chicken was good in the bite I had and she enjoyed it.  Her mashed taters were grainy, old, and dry like they had set a long time.  She didn't bother asking for butter as she was just ""over it"" in general.  My ""late night"" burger came out and I was excited about it, new concept and I love mexican food so I was excited for the chili verrde; and who doesn't like an egg on their burger right?  My burger came out of the kitchen without the fries; which were brought about 4-5 min later.  Well the chili verde must have been as old or older than my wife's mashers cuz it was soooo salty I had her taste it to make sure I wasn't crazy (you know how sauce cooks down and gets all salty?) or someone just did not follow the recipe at all.  The over saltyness rendered the $13 burger inedible.  I told the waiter about the burger and he offered to replace it, cool! In the waiter's defense, he was overall pleasant, and after about 5 min into waiting on my new order, asked if I wanted a soup or salad while I waited.  So another 10 minutes (for a total of 15, my wife and friends were DONE with their meals) my ""bbq brisket burger"" (or whatever they call the brisket topped burger) came out.  If I were Gordom Ramsey I would have summarily tossed the plate on the floor and yelled ""THIS IS STONE COLD"".  The bbq sauce was cold like it just came out of the refrigerator, there was literally 2 TINY morsels of brisket (net less than half an ounce, really), the patty seemed to have been reheated and allowed to cool again.  They were more than generous with the nearly frozen sauce though.  The burger did come out with fries this time on the first shot though, so atleast they got that part right.  I even told the waiter about it being cold, but that I didn't want to waste any more time trying to get something right from ""that"" kitchen. Before I could finish gagging down what I did eat of my burger, the waiter came by with the check and asked us if we could ""please take care of this right away as they are cutting me loose for the night"".  We never did see or have the manager visit our table through this ordeal. I really need to learn to be less accommodating when it comes to stuff like this.  I had wanted to goto Lucha Libre, which is good, and something I can ONLY get in San Diego.  I can go to any BJ's and get sub par food and over priced, warmish ""micro brew"".  I completely had low expectations from the beginning as I have not, and never will utter the phrase ""let's go to BJ's"" but have relented and gone a very few times over the years.  I did get a good burger one time at the one in Riverside, CA.  This was my 5th or 6th time going to a BJ's, there won't be another.  Usually it is just bad food, but the complete total lack of execution, and apparent apathy of the management is enough for me to wash my hands of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=140

I saw a lot of people either waiting for long periods to get their drinks, or, the server completely forgot to bring their drink. Aside from that, said servers were pleasant. I would just walk to the bar each time I wanted another drink and my excellent bartender, Brittany H, would get my order right away and I was quickly back to my group with a fresh, cold beer, while my friends had to wait for theirs. The only tricky thing was actually walking on the restaurant floor. It was super slippery (and I was wearing new sneakers). I asked someone from my group who also inside as I ice-skated quickly and shakily past them, ""Is it just me or is this floor slippery?"" He said, ""Not just you. It is!"" Luckily I have good balance but I thought someone is going to slip and fall. Not good. But the place was fine other than the above.

Jennifer C.,"San Diego, CA",78,12,12,1.0,1/15/2016,"It pains me to leave this review because I do enjoy coming to this restaurant.  However, I have not been here in a while and had a terrible experience today at lunch. I called in a take out order.  I ordered the lunch special with a classic baked potato, add bacon and cheese and a tomato and mozzarella salad.  I went to pick up my lunch and it was ready when I got there. I looked at the baked potato and noticed it was missing butter, sour cream, and chives. All items the classic baked potato comes with. I decided not to make a big deal out of it and just told the server that it looked like the sour cream was missing. His response was, oh you wanted sour cream. I really wanted to tell him that it comes with what I ordered, but I didn't want to have to educate him on a menu item that he should know. I again, let this slide.  Next it came to paying for my lunch he told me the total and automatically I knew it was wrong. There is no way the lunch combo is $11+.  I believe it is 7.25, but then I did add bacon and extra cheese to the baked potato so I imagined it increased the price, but didn't know how much. After I paid the server handed me my bag, but did not give me the receipt. I had to ask for it. As I was walking out I noticed I was rang up for a baked potato meal add cheese and bacon. It was odd to me that I was able to get the correct order, meaning I also got the salad, but yet the way it was listed on the receipt was incorrect. I went to my car to make sure to look up the menu online and sure enough it was wrong.  I went back into the restaurant and advised the server that was helping me that I think my meal was rung up incorrectly. He looked at the receipt and then said oh it looks like my manager entered this in incorrectly (ZERO accountability), let me go get him, I will be right back. I was leaning up again the wall with my back to the kitchen on my phone. A few minutes later I hear a ""hi my name is _____(I forget what the guys name was, I think it was Paul or Mark or something)"". I didn't turn around because I had no idea he was talking to me. Then he repeats himself, this time with a slightly ruder tone.  The first tone wasn't pleasant to begin with. He said you wanted to speak to me. I said, no, I told this gentleman that I thought my order was entered in incorrectly and I overpaid for my meal. He looks at the receipt and said oh, well you can jut give her the difference. He said, yeah it looks like he (ZERO Accountability again) rang it in incorrectly.  The server then gives the difference back and I went about my way, but with a slightly jaded perspective of this restaurant. A. How did I receive the correct order (kind of), but yet pay for a different meal? B.  Was my meal entered incorrectly because the server was then going to go back in and change the order and take the difference as a tip, or was who ever who rang me in just that lazy and incompetent? C. The manager was an ASS! You can tell he had a bit of a chip on his shoulder. I am not sure if he is a new manager or just the day time manager because I have gone to this restaurant in the evening and have had nothing but nice things to say about all the staff. I wish I could blame his rudeness on the rush hour lunch, but it was 2 o'clock and the restaurant was not busy at all. In fact when I walked in the first time i had two servers look at me and not help me and then when I came back due to the overcharging there were two other servers at the take out station again just standing there, not helping.

They will take forever to bring out your food to the point that the food comes out cold and needs to be heated. You are lucky if you get 1 refill of your drink.

As the saying goes, but I ignored the cliche to give this place a second chance and paid the price The first time was pretty innocent. Undercooked lasagna that had to be sent back. I was done before my wife got her remade lasagna. No offer of 'on the house', or even a free dessert. Ok. The second time in May 2015 it was a disaster. I ordered the salmon and when it came out, it was raw in the middle. I asked to please cook longer, and the waitress took it away. Came back 10 mins later, and it was hardly any better. Salmon should be a nice pink throughout, and the inside on this was still cold to the touch, and rubbery like sushi.  I asked for a manager, and asked, ""Is it me or is this still undercooked?"" She agreed, apologized, and took it away. My wife had finished her meal and my stomach rumbled. When it came a third time it was broken into pieces, and crispy all around the outside. I said its fine, I was starving. Manager said the Salmon was on the house. Wife's meal and drinks would be charged though. I thought at least the drinks as well should have been comp'd. The final thing came when paying the bill. It was $49.27 and I gave a $60 bill. The waitress brought it back with just a $10 bill inside. No coins? Really? She just turned her back and walked away like we were the most insulting table she'd ever served.  I left the $10 as tip, and almost started to go back and oping out she was short on the change, but my wife and voice of reason just said, ""Don't do it, we're just not coming  back"".

Kalvin P.,"San Diego, CA",237,380,257,4.0,5/2/2016,"I've actually come here several times within the last couple months and always come out happy. Parking can be difficult, as stated. Parking spaces are small, even if you have a compact car. Spots near the entrance of the building are always taken too. If you're here during dinner time, you're going to have to park a little further away unless you get lucky and someone pulls out of their spot right when you're pulling up. Still, ambience in here is very nice. Lighting is a little dim, but the only time that affects anything is when i'm trying to take a picture of my food haha Hostesses have always been pleasant and even during busy times, they'll get to your table as fast as they can. This last time I visited, they had the option for you to leave your number and they'd text you when a booth/table was available if you wanted to sit and have a drink at the bar while you waited. Very cool! Waitresses the last couple times have been knowledgeable of their menu and never forgot to come back for refills or to bring extra ranch (yes, i'm one of those people lol). My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the artichoke spinach dip. So good haha. As far as entree's go, I'm usually a pizza guy. I remember their pizza being VERY good before, HOWEVER, the last two times I've gone, the crust seemed a little more dry than usual. As in not enough sauce on the pizza to soak into the deep dish. Topping and cheese were delicious though. I'm a big pizza fan and theirs was one of my favorites so I might give it another try before I call it quits. Maybe even request a little extra sauce next time too. Ahi Poke salad is good as well. Give that a try! Overall, aside from the parking, my experiences have always been pleasant here.

The restaurant was surprisingly a bit empty for the day and time we went. Shortly after finding a table, a server came by and gave us menus. He was a very friendly guy who took our orders promptly. We ordered three orders of happy hour sized wings and potstickers as well as a Jeremiah Red and Double Berry. While the drinks came at a normal pace, the food came out a little slower than it should have considering the small amount of people in the restaurant. However, when the food finally did arrive, everything was cooked satisfactorily. I was bit disappointed that the server didn't come around very often. A couple times, we had to flag him down to get something. Overall, it was an okay visit. The food and drinks were good, but the service lacked.

The grilled steak salad is really tasty with the warm grilled veggies and blue cheese tossed into the mix. BJ's has a ton of beer on tap. If you can't find something to tickle your fancy, their bottle selection is pretty impressive as well. They even have root beer and cream soda on draft. You can't come to BJ's and not have a pazookie. These things are a billion calories each, but they are so evil and good. Warm cookie out of the oven with vanilla ice cream melting on top.

The thing that amazed me was they had no problem giving us individual checks.The lunch specials are a great deal, if you ask me. We were here sort of late...got to the restaurant at 7:30 and left around 9:30 or 10. The area is pretty well lit but there weren't many people around so I was glad I was walking with several people. So while it's in a shopping center, it's not someplace that has a lot of traffic late at night. The parking is inside the Hazard Center.

They have happy hour during game days at the bar area.  First of all the food is great as usual...that I have no complaints about.   The beginning of our lengthy stay at BJ's for both the play off games and Super bowl started out great, good service in the beginning and when our server left for the day we cashed out and our server informed the next server that we would be staying for the game.  That is when everything went down hill and we didn't get any service at the bar area.  During play offs we had to wave someone down to ask them where our server was...then the server barely came by our table.   But today was the worst....we were ignored...there was a server in our area serving everyone else, walked by or table multiple times and never said a word. Not even a ""hey, you girls doing ok, is someone helping you, can I get you anything?""... From the beginning of the national anthem to half time no service, we ended up having to go to the bar to order or food and drinks.  My friend ended up telling management how dissatisfied we were.  Then we finally had someone come over but we already started a tab with the bartender and just went to the bar when needed.   The Bartender staff was verry friendly and helpful and when the food came out they had someone deliver it to our table.  I will still come back because the food is really good and I liked that they added gluten free pizza to the happy hour menu.  Hopefully they will train the wait staff better.

Then another food server young guy looked confused and dropped off a dessert with a lit candle in it and said it's for you from your waiter. He looked confused and literally walked fast away. We were like what?? Then our waiter came back and said oh that's a mistake grabbed it and put it on the table behind us to a couple. It was melting and they ate it.

This is a restaurant, how can you not have any servers available?!  It was slow enough to have at least one server start the drinks while we waited for the rest of the servers to ""clock"" on.  So we decided to wait because we really wanted to eat here.

Ashley W.,"Encinitas, CA",73,45,4,4.0,3/4/2015,"I am a huge fan of BJ's Brewhouse, in general. The food is consistently good, I love beer and the service is always pretty good, too. With that being said, with every chain, you encounter the ""good"" ones and the ""bad"" ones. As in, you will drive past three Denny's in order to get to the ""good"" one. At least, I'm one of those people. This was my first time at this specific location. And it was GREAT! I brought my little brother and sister (brother is of drinking age) and it was their first time. It was a really good experience overall. Our waiter was pretty busy but still attentive and very sweet. Our food was prompt and delicious. The ambiance is nice and mellow. I felt like I could lounge there all day and no one would care. Who has time for that, though? lol The seating could have the promise of being a little crowded if it had been busier but while i was there, it was busy but without the claustrophobic feeling of too many bodies in one area. I had the Chicken Pesto sandwich (I know, super simple) but it was extremely delicious! We also had the Avocado rolls which were amazing, as well.

AM G.,"San Diego, CA",1,3,2,1.0,9/8/2015,"My girlfriend and I try our very best to develop an objective view of a restaurant or business.  Since BJ's Brewhouse is fairly close, we wanted to make it work by trying the Sunday brunch, lunch menu, and dinner menus over the course of several visits. After each visit, we just could not find the silver lining. Although the wait staff is always friendly, service from getting water, to appetizers, to main courses has repeatedly been slow. Sometimes 10 minutes go by before drink orders are taken and most times food takes 30-40 minutes.  The food, is another issue. The stuffed mushrooms and calamari are better choices as they are not as greasy as the rest of the appetizer choices. However, the last visit, the calamari was burnt. The main entrees, from house salads to enlightened choices, to pizza, or whatever your choice may be, comes out consistently inconsistent. Sometimes undercooked, sometimes burnt, sometimes so salty that even after scrapping a layer of seasoning off of your grilled chicken dishes ( yes, a layer of seasoning actually peels off the chicken) you are left trying to find something to combat the saltiness.  To be fair, we have not tried desert, but the reviews on that seem to be consistent with what we have experienced. In the end, it is a great place to find decent beers, but don't go there hungry for good food. You may find yourself waiting only to be marginally satisfied with mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=340

When we got inside the hostess was kind and friendly. The guy who led us to our table must have been new because he was a little slow but that's okay. The table where I sat had a odor that was unpleasant but it was sealable since it was so crowded. Our waitress was the sweetest person I have ever met. She made sure that we were taken care of and suggested what my sister should get as she was majorly indecisive. My food wasn't anything special but I wasn't expecting great Cajun from a San Diego restaurant. When it was time to go we paid after a pen mishap that was greatly taken care of and we were on our way.  I would definitely go here again without hesitation and I would tell my friends.

Lux S.,"San Diego, CA",145,135,135,4.0,3/17/2014,"This particular location is fairly newer than the other ones. This establishment is geared towards bigger parties looking for food and fun. Great for parties, birthdays, celebrations. The parking can be an issue. It is a decent lot however it is always difficult to find one close to the entrance, you usually have to park very far from the restaurant especially during busier hours. I've always enjoyed the flights. You can choose up to four or eight. If you get eight, be prepared to be either drunk or at least slightly intoxicated. The stout is always favored by me but I also enjoy their hefe and the brown ale. They are generous in their flights and priced fairly. They an extensive list of beers but also provide a full service bar if you're looking for more than beer in the alcohol department. I've had the ahi poke which is OK but nicely paired with thin crispy chips. I feel it is prepared mediocre and is a shared appetizer but small in quantity yet pricey.  I always have good service here, everyone is professional and welcoming in their demeanor. What is nice is their lunch menu from 11-3pm.

Jennifer V.,"San Diego, CA",126,152,152,1.0,12/1/2014,"I try to be fair with my reviews so I've been holding off on writing this update in hopes that things would change here, but after getting food poisoning from this location, I just can't hold back any longer.  I've been to BJ's more than a handful of times in the past few months to sit at the bar for football games. The bar is usually pretty full, but not more than any other restaurant I've been to on a busy day. The service is ALWAYS incredibly slow but typically, I don't care that much if there's a good game on. For a while, I thought that maybe they were just having a difficult time handling football season, but I started to look around and notice employees standing around, talking to each other, and doing a whole lot of nothing.  On Saturday, I went with some friends and my boyfriend to BJ's to watch the Apple Cup. Initially, we were sitting outside but decided we wanted to move inside where it was a bit warmer. We were told the game would be played outside so we didn't want to move inside unless the game would also be played inside. I grabbed a table and asked the first server that walked by if the Apple Cup would be on one of the TV's. He said that he would find out for me so I waited there patiently. He disappeared for a few minutes and came back into the bar and started serving his tables again, as I sat there waiting on if I should tell my party to come inside or not. Finally after waiting awhile, a waitress comes up to serve me. I told her I asked one of the waiters if they would play the game and that he never came back. She confirmed that it wouldn't be a problem.  Once we finally sat down, it took a LONG time to get our first round of drinks. By the time we wanted to order food, I couldn't find our waitress anywhere. As we waited, I made eye contact with several employees that walked by, as well as those who were standing around talking. They simply looked over and looked away quickly. Finally, I saw our waitress and had to flag her down since she wasn't even planning on stopping by. My boyfriend and I ordered sliders for an appetizer and BBQ chicken pizza for dinner, with a side of ranch for myself. My friend ordered pizza with a side of ranch as well, while her husband ordered lasagna. The food was okay, or so I thought. Before I get into that, I have to mention that by the time the Apple Cup was about to come on, our waitress told us she could not play it after she had promised they would. We called a manager over and luckily he said he would turn the game on for us. Well, the game had already started and we were still waiting for the channel to change. I looked around at several employees that ignored me again so I went up to one of the hostesses and asked for help. Finally, the game was turned on.  About 3 to 4 hours after eating, I started to feel nauseous. I know most people have their own idea of when food poisoning occurs, but if you take a look at the FDA's website for food poisoning, you'll learn that there isn't just one generic timeline of when it occurs after you've ingested contaminated food. For example, the website notes that foods such as egg salads and creamy foods can cause food poisoning symptoms such as sudden onset of severe nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever. The symptoms may be present within 1-6 hours and last for 24-48 hours.  It really depends on the type of food and bacteria ingested.  With that being said, my friend and I were up throughout the entire night with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and fever. My boyfriend and her husband were fine, so we narrowed the problem down to the ranch dressing we both ate. We did not eat any of the same foods the day(s) before so it would be too big of a coincidence that we were both up all night long with the same symptoms. She was vomiting blood at one point and her parents almost took her to the emergency room. I was considering going too as I lost track of how many times I had vomited, but figured I wouldn't since my boyfriend wasn't sick. I didn't know till the following day that my friend had food poisoning as well. We were both sick all day on Sunday and could barely eat a thing. Today, I still feel as if I got kicked in the stomach, but I'm a lot better than I was yesterday.  I called BJ's and notified them so other people don't suffer. They apologized and told me that I would be contacted soon by corporate. The manager I spoke with suggested that ""there's been something going around lately"" as if we can't tell the difference between obvious food poisoning and the flu. I wasted the last day of my Thanksgiving vacation being sick because of someone else's carelessness. Mistakes happen but like I said before, the staff here overall just doesn't seem to have their act together and I don't plan on eating here again since I can't trust that the food is managed properly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=440

Curt T.,"San Diego, CA",39,94,87,1.0,2/11/2014,"I've been to this location many times and generally the service is pretty good. Today we didn't get any service. We ordered the unlimited soup and salad and my friend got the mini one topping pizza for lunch. The sad thing is was he was almost done eating the pizza before my salad and soup arrived. My friend had to mention the fact that he never got his salad and that was brought about 10 minutes later. Once our food was brought to the table we Never saw our waitress again. Many servers walked past our table and didn't even acknowledge we were there. A bus boy cleaned our dishes off the table and I wasn't even done eating. ( yes the dishes were empty) but I would think that most people that order something that is endless would at least get a second serving if not more of it. Hence that's why they get the endless/unlimited version of it.  So here we were, sitting there waiting for our server to come back so I could get another bowl of soup and salad. SHE NEVER came back EVER!!!! I finally flagged down the hostess when she walked by to seat another customer and she said she would get them for us. 5 min later no one still appeared at out table. Saw the hostess what appeared to be walking around looking for our server but she  apparently  was no where to be found. We got up and walked up to the hostess stand and asked for our check. They said the server is working on it and the hostess stated that out server was missing in action. ( her words not ours) I told them I got the unlimited soup and salad and still hungry but at this point I just want to leave and go to jack in the box and eat something there.  They gave the excuse that their computer system was having some problems. I can give them that for the slow speed of getting the check to us but doesn't explain why we never seen our waitress or never got a second bowl of soup and salad.  A computer doesn't cause bad slow service.  So they ended up adding our total bill at the hostess stand with our help. They just apologized but never offered us a discount or a coupon for a possible next visit. They could have handled this much better.  Again I like BJ's and am ever a reward card holder and don't expect top notch service all the time but this was beyond bad service. They could have handled the poor customer better. I work in customer service so I know good from bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=480

Andy S.,"San Diego, CA",188,5,,2.0,7/6/2014,"1st up we are big BJ fans, having gone to their restaurant in Reno NV 100's of times. I have to say that this BJ's is the worst BJ's food wise in the chain. We tried them about 2 months after the opened as we were excited one of our favorite restaurants had opened close to where we now live. Unfortunately the food was sub par at best, it was like someone who had never been trained to cook had been thrown a recipe book and simply did their best. The service was ok nothing to rave about. So we left feeling a little bummed that our Experience paled in comparison to our Reno BJ experiences. Anyway we decided that we would wait and went a 2nd time because we thought maybe it was opening issues and we wanted to know if it had improved we wanted it to be improved so bad! Unfortunately the 2nd time  i can easily say that the food was worse. My wife enjoyed her taco's but the steak i ordered was burnt our stuffed mushrooms was so embarrassing i call the manager over and he was horribly embarrassed. It seems they have a very lazy kitchen. Some one in their isn't doing a very good job. We will try it a again in a few months just because we know BJ's typically are good value. The staff was very nice, friendly and helpful the restaurant is awesome to sit in and look at but the food has some serious issues that need attention. My hopes is that the management does something about it soon so we can start enjoying our BJ's experience again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=480

Leon C.,"San Diego, CA",24,17,22,2.0,4/12/2014,"First time at a BJ's Brewery and I was not impressed on any level.  The excitement of my friend's words were way out-of-bounds.  Only plus was immediate seating during a busy lunch.  The restaurant decor layout and atmosphere is nice.  But what's a good looking anything that doesn't run smoothly.   Service was way beyond slow and way below par.  The table I was seated at didn't have any silverware.  Took over 5 min for the server to arrive to our table for an initial beverage order.  And a nice 10 min before they returned with the drinks.  Next the server only gave my friend napkins for them to place their drink on.  More to be disclosed at the end of the meal. As a heads up this is not the place for any seafood lovers.  The menu is extremely limited to burgers and chicken.  I only viewed a salmon dish, lobster bisque, and lobster tacos.  This made it tough for me to practice no meat Fridays during this lent season.  So I settled for the mini one topping deep dish lunch pizza (extra cheese).  I think the food would have tasted better if it didn't take close to 20 min to reach our table.  My friend enjoyed the salad with blue cheese dressing.  And that's all that can be said. The avocado spring rolls bland and drenched with chipotle sauce.  My friend's chicken quesadilla combined four triangles were smaller than my hand.  Pizza is pizza.  We left not hungry and definitely not satisfied.   From prior dining experiences I thought when close to finishing a meal a server would approach and ask how we are doing and ask is there anything else we may like.  At least refill a drink or two.  Well at this BJ's my expectations may be a little to high especially when customer really wants another salad or water.  My friend and I sat close to 15 min after no food was left on our plates.  Also be forewarned do not ask any one outside your server for anything.  I attempted to ask a different server within the restaurant to break a large bill so we could leave and pay the bill with an exact amount of the check plus tip.  We were quickly instructed your server has to do it.  Apparently shame on me for not wanting to sit for another 5-10 min with money I wish I didn't have spend here.  So my buddy and I went to the front and paid the billed.   He asked what should we do for tip and I said give two reasons where a tip was earned.  The hostesses were nice and for me thats where it stops. For the first time in my life I used the 10% marker of bad, bad, bad overall experience only because I was forced leave a tip.  Still I'm nice enough to know it may have just been my server and not the attitude of the restaurant.  2 Stars for appearance and greeting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=420

Justin M.,"San Diego, CA",30,28,16,5.0,10/27/2015,"Wife and I decided to go here for the first time last night for our 14th wedding anniversary.  Initially we were going to another restaurant that brews in mission valley but my wife saw BJ's on the corner here and suggested a stop.  Couldn't be happier we did.  We made it in time for happy hour and decided to sit on the patio since it was such a beautiful evening.   Service: Exceptional. Our team was James and Casey who work together on the patio to make sure everyone is taken care of; James was our main Brewmaster.  I pretty much pinged him for suggestions on everything I ordered, from food to beer and his recommendations were spot on.    Food: I ordered garlic wings for an appetizer, the new Portobello Swiss Burger (from loaded burgers section) substitute Bison meat, the thin cut fries, a side of Broccoli Cheddar soup in a bread bowl, and BJ's in house Black and Tan (can't remember the exact name of it).  First off, the 5 appetizer wings blew the skin off any of the wings I've had at a certain restaurant that specializes in wings; I won't mention any names BWW...The Portobello Swiss burger was so delicious, it's like the chef was reading my mind as far as how I wanted it cooked; pink in the middle, excellent.  I highly recommend substituting the beef for the bison. The fries were acceptable as fries go, warm enough not to burn my mouth when they arrived.  If you order soup, make sure to get it in their toasted, garlic butter slathered bread bowl; eat the soup, then the bowl!  A two-for!  Then there was the beer, so many to choose from I couldn't decide, so I went with their in-house black and tan since it's been a while and I was pleasantly surprised with it's goodness; I'd definitely have it again.   My wife ordered the Spicy Hawaiian Chicken pizza and she said it was delicious, tons of flavor, and enough left over for a meal the next day. At the end of our meal James brought us a ice cream covered chocolate chip cookie with a couple of candles in it and the very nice manager took our photo.  Totally unexpected and very much appreciated.  Topped off our dining experience nicely.   Again, the service was exceptional and we're definitely going back.  Don't let the bad reviews steer you away, they deserve your business.  Thanks again James and Casey!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=420

Rana R.,"San Diego, CA",100,304,410,4.0,7/8/2014,"The word ""Pizookie Trio"" should be enough to warrant a 4-5 star rating for BJ's. Their decadent dessert can never be imitated and I can never get sick of it since they keep adding different flavors! It's pretty much my go to restaurant if I can't decide on where to go. They have really great menu options without overwhelming the customers. Their beer selection is excellent for a ""chain"" establishment. This location in Mission Valley is oddly placed and looks small from afar, but it's definitely not small. I love their outdoor patio, it's elegant and even has a fire pit for those ""cold"" SD nights. The place overall is clean & majority of the staff members were smiling. The layout of the dining area was spacious, props to whoever designed the flow of the restaurant cause it's a lot more spacious than the one in Chula Vista. In the words of Yelp, ""Yay!

That aside, mom had never been.  The hostesses were very friendly and seated us right away. I ordered sirloin with a salad and asparagus  for 15.50.  Mom got the loaded burger with shoestring fries. Both meals were delicious.   I wish that there would have been more asparagus on my plate.  It was a little sparse.  I was definitely not over full when we left.  Can't say that about mom.  Her dinner was served on a metal lunch tray thing.  She powered through most of it, though I stole a few fries. It's noisy there.  Really noisy.  I hate ambient noise so it was a little rough for me.  Other than the noise and lack of asparagus,  it was a good meal.  Not spectacular.   Maybe like a pricey Denny's.   I have tried the beer previously and liked it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=380

Comfortably spicy, juicy, saucy, and fabulous. Will definitely be getting it again! I would highly recommend putting yourself on their ""Call-Ahead"" list, especially if you're a party of 3+ and it's a weekend night. Calling ahead puts your name on their list, without having to be there. Usually, you still end up with a wait, but a much shorter one than if you had put your name on the list when you got there. Think 15 minutes vs. 40. The catch: you can't call more than 30 minutes ahead of time. However, you can seat yourself in the bar area without waiting.

Ali M.,"San Diego, CA",17,54,7,1.0,12/4/2013,"I tried giving this place a second chance today and it failed. Again. Yes, they just opened, but just opening is no excuse whatsoever for super crappy service and a manager who could not give a flying crap about the customers. There is a difference between working out the kinks and just sucking.  I made a reservation for a group of 8 at 11:30 two days prior. I got there at 11:20 by myself. I sit down waiting for 10 minutes. Keep in mind there is almost no one in the restaurant at the moment so it should not take this long. Some of my co-workers arrived and still no table. Someone came over to us and asked us if we needed any help. They had completely forgotten about me and clearly the word 'reservation' means different things to different people.  We sit down at 11:45. The waitress takes our drinks and orders. 12:30 rolls around and NO FOOD YET. We did not each order ribs with a side of burgers and steaks. The food should not take that long (salads, pasta, and sandwiches...really?).  I looked around for a manager for about 20 minutes and did not see one in sight. Finally, someone at my table asked for a manager. Fernando comes over. My co-worker expressed his numerous concerns in a very polite and concise fashion. When he told the manager he should be walking around and that not one out of eight of us had seen him so we could get his attention, he pointed aimlessly towards the other side of the restaurant and said he was walking around over there. A MANAGER should not be giving childish excuses, especially when he knew he was in the wrong. He mumbled sorry and walked away. Didn't talk to the waitress about the situation, didn't apologize sincerely, barely acknowledged our existence, and didn't take a thing off of our check.

Jacqueline G.,"San Diego, CA",220,348,35,3.0,1/10/2014,"I am a big fan of BJ's beer and like the fact there's a large open location as opposed to the tiny La Jolla one near UCSD. Actually this location is even bigger than the one in downtown La Jolla. You can tell the staff is still pretty new but nice. I wish they would be diligent about your water as well but they were good about watching if people wanted more refills on beer. I was surprised that the pizza was not greasy but I guess it just depends on what you get. We ordered two large pizzas: The Chicken Bacon Ranch and the BJ's Original. I was surprised of how little pizza sauce was on the BJ's Original. I guess I didn't fully read the description. There are a lot of chunky ingredients on there like olives, cube tomatoes, onions, it's like you're getting your healthy serving of veggies on a piece of bread. The pizza dough wasn't doughy but it was more like on the simple bread side. Good bread. But since it was lacking pizza sauce it was kinda dry and you had the urge to dip it in something. I usually don't need hot sauce or ranch to dip my pizza but I felt that I needed it for this one. The Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza wasn't my first choice but friends wanted it. It turned out that it was not overpowered by ranch. Actually, didn't really taste much ranch. You'll probably enjoy the bacon pieces if you like bacon. I'm just meh about bacon in general. Depends on my mood. It was pretty cheesey though. I think there was cheddar and mozzarella.  Again, the location is huge and they have an outside patio with a fire pit. I can imagine on a beautiful San Diego day that it would be awesome to sit out there. Oh yeah, there are TV's all around so hopefully you're lucky enough you're sitting by a corner of them so you can enjoy the hockey and basketball game at the same time. I'll be back to enjoy other BJ's menu items at this location but it doesn't feel smooshed in regards to spacing of the restaurant. Be warned, the parking lot is kinda small and I can imagine during prime lunch and dinner times you're stalking those who are leaving or you just park far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=500

Memeow R.,"San Diego, CA",6,25,6,3.0,9/13/2014,"Went out with a group of friends. The service was fairly attentive. We started with some appetizers the calamari  is nice and comes with the tentacles. For the main course I got the Santa Fe styled salad and some others got pasta, a steak another appetizer and a sandwich. The food did not all come out together which is weird. Two items came out then one more. The server said the steak would be a few more minutes but the salad was MIA and no words were said about how long it would take.  The salad arrived a few minutes before the steak came out. Working in the industry I just thought it was extremely unprofessional to have the food come out at all different times.  Not sure why the salad took almost as long as a medium well steak.

The ""deal"" makes no sense for the Gf option and there is way cheaper Gf pizza (and better tasting) around SD.  So after going through that and still ordering 2 Gf pizzas, salad and dessert they serve my salad with croutons, left toppings off my pizza, and the toppings that I did ordered were concentrated to only one section of the pizza.   Literally had to shred the ham around the pie myself.  If you are looking for Gf pizza in SD please check out pizza port or ANYWHERE ELSE but here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=360

We have normally had pretty good experiences with BJ's, but last night was very disappointing to say the least! We had a ask several times for refills on drinks, the drinks that were delivered were incorrect once. The appetizer arrived within a good amount of time, we ordered the Beginners Sampler, and the food was AMAZING on it! Will definitely be ordering it again! We also ordered the medium deep dish pepperoni extreme (or explosion, can't remember the name!), and were disappointed on several levels. The waitress CLEARLY forgot to put our order for it in, since the two people next to us who were seated 10 minutes after we placed our order, got theirs first, and we specially ordered a medium because it said it was 8 slices, and it came sliced for 6. Normally not the worst thing in the world BUT... it was not a good meal! The dough was half undercooked and half over cooked, there was hardly any pepperoni on the entire pie and it just in general did not meet expectations! Disappointing experience for sure!!!

After eating a dry pizza I received my bill to find no discount on my mushrooms. I brought it to the bartenders attention and she went to check only to return saying oh no it's not on this appetizer. WTF you said we could any appetizer we want. Management should clarify which appetizers are part of your happy hour so guest don't feel bamboozled.

Joe C.,"San Diego, CA",120,135,142,4.0,11/22/2013,"We were on our way for a quick snack at Smash Burger in Hazard Center when we noticed BJ's looked open? I could swear I was here only a week ago, and they didn't even look close to being ready for business. There were televisions on on the nice patio, a fireplace going on the patio as well, people walking in and out....they were open! They opened on Monday, 4 days earlier. Well screw Smash Burger, this place looks dope! We walked in the cool rotating doors (Love Rotating Doors), and wow, this place is huge! Its like one giant room with high ceilings. On the left wall is the kitchen, and the right wall is a bar, with lots of bottles and colored lights. Its got this cafeteria feel when you first walk in, but not in a bad way.  I manage a restaurant, so I'm paying attention to everything. Having just gone through a grand opening 10 months ago, I know how hard opens can be. They of course had plenty of staff on, the hostess staff were very friendly, and when a host sat us, he was surprisingly knowledgeable for a host. He offered us the rundown on craft beers and cocktails, and even threw in ""his favorite"" was the orange soda, nice suggestive sell guy! I got the orange soda, it was great! I remember thinking, that guy was a fantastic host, he'd be a server in no time.  Our server was nice, did a great job of suggesting appetizers and entrees he liked. They did switch servers on us halfway through the meal, which I don't recommend doing. You cant possibly be worried about labor during the first week of opening. Anyhow, our second waiter was actually better than the first, sorry, he had more personality and definitely felt more comfortable taking about the food.  So for the food: The fried hush pup (I think) with the bacon aioli was bomb. Like little donuts with bacon mayo. The margarita flatbread pizza was good, nothing too special.  Chicken lettuce wraps were better than good, but the spicy mustard is hot! I put too much on and gassed my nose pipes.  The warm cookie with ice cream was too damn good. I gobbled that thing down. We got the ""mini"" version of that dessert, and it was the perfect size.  Overall, we only ate apps and desert, so I'll be back to try entrees and maybe they can squeeze another star out of me.

He Began to ask what we wanted to eat. We said we would like drinks first then we will order. He took our drink order walked away and never got our drinks.

Justin R.,"San Diego, CA",172,14,2,2.0,12/23/2015,I usually love coming here to eat but tonight I had one of the worst waiters ever! He took forever with coming to our table when we first sat down. Then after we got everything ordered it took him forever to bring our food to us. Come to realize he was basically ignoring all of his tables to spend more time at a table full of females. He never once showed his face the whole time I spent eating my food. Never asked us how our food was and then when we asked for two boxes he only showed up back to the table with one for the pizza and then gave a look of disgust when we asked for a second box for my friends wife's food. I don't even know his name because that's how poor of service it was. The only distinguishing thing about him from all the other servers was his beard. I really wish I would have asked to speak to the manager because we were highly disappointed with our service and lack of attention towards us. I never even got my drink refilled and it took him almost 20 minutes to refill my friends drink.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=540

The waitstaff was attentive but we had trouble seeing the chargers game. There's a good amount of tvs all around the restaraunt. When I requested my table I confirmed that we would be able to see the Chargers game, they told me it wouldn't be a problem.  The tv by our table kept flipping through channels but never landed on the chargers game. We literally asked at least 5 different servers to put the charger game on and everyone said they would. This literally went on for 3 hours and they still never turned the game on. A manager came over and we asked her what the problem was. She literally almost started crying and said everyone was asking for different things and she couldn't please everyone. We empathized but reiterated that our party of 20 that literally took up the entire area of the restaraunt wanted our TV changed to the Charger game. She said she would put it on, then walked away and we never saw it. I was really perturbed because I thought we were in San Diego. Why would you have to fight to watch the hometown team?

We had never went there before, but he was friendly and welcoming. Once we ordered our appetizers came out hot and yummy and fairly quick. Big difference from waiting for our drinks at applebees. I got my mozzarella and tomato salad, it was god sent I swear. It was so delicious, I always crave one now. The roast beef sandwich was a roast beef sandwich not much you can do there but the fries and everything else was amazing. Our server had great up sale skills. Sold me so quick on a pazookie.

He was very pleasant and, even though he was moving very quickly, he took time with each customer to answer all of their questions with a genuine smile that never faded. The next day we came back to BJ's and sat in the patio area. The patio area was very nice with comfortable seating and a great atmosphere. Ian was my server and he was one of the sweetest, most attentive waiters I've ever had. He was constantly checking on our table, making sure we had everything we needed.

Elizabeth C.,"San Diego, CA",91,335,258,4.0,12/2/2013,"Welcome to Mission Valley BJ's!  I discovered BJ's Restaurant and Brewery 12 years ago when I was living in Boulder and I have been a fan ever since.  After Maria Maria shut down a couple of years ago, this location sat sad and vacant for far too long.  Then one glorious day there was a sign announcing a BJ's was coming soon.  Excellent choice!  This means in Mission Valley alone you have San Diego Brew Co, Gordon Biersch, Lazy Dog, and BJ's (just to name a few) for a place to get some food and drink some good beer.  Yum! BJ's always has awesome pizzas and calzones.  I tend to make my own calzone to avoid an overload of pork options that I am allergic to.  It's so nice when restaurants offer a ""build your own"" option, and I wish more did.  Their sandwiches are delicious, especially the beef dip.  When I had lunch at this location just a week ago, we started our lunch off with an ahi poke appetizer, my husband enjoyed a bison burger, and I got the grilled maui mahi.  We also enjoyed some pints of their harvest pumpkin beer, and it was very tasty.  BJs has over a dozen of their own beers to choose from on tap, from your lightest ales to your darkest stouts, they will have something for you to enjoy. For dessert we got a pizookie  (baked cookie with ice cream on top).  They have multiple cookies to chose from and you can even mix and match for a half and half choice.  So we got half red velvet and half white macadamia nut cookie a la mode with French vanilla ice cream. I felt the service was up to speed and the staff were all friendly.  Even the manager stopped by and asked how we were enjoying our meal.  Considering I went here shortly after they opened color me impressed.  I've seen restaurants fall apart in their first month of being open, and I'm not seeing that as the case for BJs. Parking is shared with the other businesses of Hazard Center.  I don't ever have a problem with parking, but I'm sure on more busy/popular nights for that shopping center it can become a bit more chaotic.  That's to be expected for Hazard Center.

The food not a fan of, ordered the potato skins and i dont know about u guys but i like my bacon well cooked where it crunches in ur mouth not the bacon that u have to pull apart with your teeth. Next up was the pizza was still doughy in the middle, cheese was melty but not cooked. Not happy at all. Was here on a date and he ordered the shrimp scampi and shit was bland and flavorless.. How can this place say they are the best place to go eat? We sat next to another couple who tried to get their attention several times after they got their salad yet no fork.. Got pizza and guess what still no fork! Damn how many do they have to ask to get silverware?? I dont recommend this place i know its just my experience but you all are grown adults you can decide for your self. At the end they did make up for it tho.. A free desert...

Zach C.,"San Diego, CA",93,24,9,1.0,8/9/2015,"Love the food, however ok this occasion I came with my wife's family from Trinidad. Yes, they look different than me (im white) and yes they can be difficult to understand (thick accents). And yes they felt as though the waitresses were just annoyed as to have to deal with the entire table OF 18! Waitress initially refused to split checks because she didn't listen to my wife the first time second time, she walked away from her as she was explaining it. (We had asked this initially upon sitting down with the hostess). Then told well you're going to need to wait 30 minutes in a rude tone almost as if to convince us not to want that done. Of course we waited. The manager was kind friendly and understanding) (young blond, thank you). Anyway, for a post wedding lunch, we felt like they couldn't get rid of us sooner but we enjoyed our family time but we won't be coming back here sorry. Not even for pazookie. I'm white so I rarely experience feeling outcast for my appearance or dialect, but 17 of members of my new family sure did.  First time in California for them, and at BJs. And the last. 604 dollar bill. Pretty sure the tip we reflective on that stay. Next time we'll just like into an In and out. But don't worry this to us was not reflective on my overall BJ experiences . Just don't hesitate to speak honor your frumpy waitress is having a bad day and wants to make her unhappiness become your (or 18 people's) unhappiness. Maybe I could have offered her a job. I work with at risk children and I am disrespectes hit kicked spit on and assaulted on a regular basis.

Things didn't seem good right in the door. I went in while my husband parked the car. The hostess was helping someone so I politely waited. About 3-4 minutes later another couple came in and walked in front of me (rude) and after about a minute she took their names to be seated. I stood there wondering if I was suddenly invisible! I told the hostess I'd been waiting while she was helping the other customer (I know she saw me waiting!) and I hope she didn't just put the other people before me. She never said she didn't see me, she just said she was sorry and she had me seated next. Thankfully the service was good. The food was OK. Again, I think they are over priced. I had the Asian salad and my husband had steak. The salad was good but his steak was tough. He had a side salad and the croutons were stale.

Gwen displayed a serving experience that is rarely common these days. She hit every check mark of what makes an Excellent server. She introduced herself which was quickly  followed up by a recommendation of what we would probably like to drink, suggesting several different cocktails. She checked up on us frequently enough to fill up waters, answer questions, and anything we ordered she followed up with detailed questions to make sure nothing had to be customized.  I know this probably sounds typical to most, but I eat out probably 5 days a week due to a busy work life. So coming from experience, I felt she was the most authentic, knowledgeable, accurate and attentive server that I have engaged with in a long time.

Thao N.,"San Diego, CA",25,38,110,2.0,5/16/2014,"I've been to the location in Grossmont before and the food & service was always great! However, this location made me feel like I should've went to Lazy Dog instead..  I was in the mood for something small and light so I looked at their happy hour deals and none of it really stood out to me, which made me think I really should've went down the street to Lazy Dog instead. Nonetheless, we ordered the California(?) flatbread, I can't recall the name, but it had chunks of tomatoes, avocados and grilled chicken with a tangy white sauce, and the Tuscan Chicken Limone pasta dish. It took about 15 mins for this tiny dish to come and the restaurant wasn't even busy at all. I noticed our server was walking extremely slow to our table like he was just taking a nice walk in the park. Thank goodness the food made up for it because the flatbread was delicious! The ingredients all seemed very fresh without being too heavy.  The pasta dish finally came and that's when we realized they never gave us our utensils or napkins. We flagged down a waiter and that's when the girl who was originally our waitress came by and dropped off our utensils without even apologizing and didn't bother to look at us. I'm not sure whether they didn't pay attention to us as much just because we only ordered two dishes or their service is just straight up crappy, but hey, what can you expect from big chain restaurants right? And even after she dropped it off, we realized the napkin was completely filthy and had to exchange for another one.  The pasta dish was okay, nothing really stood out to me. It had two pieces of toasted bread, angel hair pasta, two thick pieces of chicken, canned artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes. The chicken was perfectly cooked and had a good taste to it and the sauce was cheesy yet light. The canned artichoke hearts balanced out the flavors with a hint of acidity. Pasta was okay, but a bit overcooked. I usually soak my bread into the sauce but there was barely any sauce and the bread was too crunchy to the point where it was hurting my mouth.  I don't think we will ever be returning to this specific location or go to BJ's specifically for their happy hour, but if I am ever craving a pizookie or a deep dish pizza then this is the place to go to!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=400

I've been a regular at the BJs in my hometown of Burbank and have had generally good experiences but this one really left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). Here is what went wrong: 1. Parking sucks, its a big shopping center with a lot of business. While there is a good number of parking spots, its a quite a walk for a (unusually) cold, rainy San Diego night. 2. When we got there, the hostess told us it was 20 minute wait OR we could sit outside or cocktail area. They DID not tell us the outside area has no umbrellas or anything to shield us from the rain. Why would they even have they area open? We sat there for 15 minutes ordered food and drinks but the misty rain took a toll.

Kelly J.,"San Diego, CA",79,113,1017,3.0,4/15/2014,"The service or lack thereof has been heavily discussed in other reviews. Because of this, I will start this review by commenting on the service.  Here's is what I liked and what I think needs improvement about the service: Likes: 1) Our waitress was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the food and drink menu. 2) She was patient with all our questions and did not rush us with our order.  3) This is very cool......she told us when she was going on break and told us that another waiter would be checking up on us (our food and drink had arrived at that point). I can't tell you how many wait staff at other restaurants would disappear leaving us to wonder if they were done for the day or were taking a break. This was beyond professional. Nicely done! 4) She served us the first slice of pizza. It's the small things that add up. Needs Improvement: 1) While our waitress was on break, a gentleman wearing a blue shirt which was different from the rest of the wait staff, came over and asked if we wanted a box for our pizza. We had only finished two slices of pizza. I think it would have gone over better if he had first asked us if we were still working on the pizza. I understand restaurants are volume driven businesses, but making the customer feel rushed is not a model of great service. And who knows, maybe the customer will order dessert, more drinks etc. if they don't feel rushed. Just a thought.  2) Probably being a little nick picky here, but we ordered an appetizer, salad and pizza.  It would have been nice to ask if we wanted everything all at once or if we wanted the salad and appetizer first and then the pizza. Instead, they brought everything out at once without asking. This goes back to the first point about not making the customer feel rushed.  3) I had finished my tasters, but I was not asked if I wanted anything else to drink. Again, back to the first point.  Conclusion on Service: I have mixed feelings about the service. I can't say it was the worst service but I also can't say it was the best. I do not expect perfect service, but I also do not expect to feel rushed. There are tons of factors that account for awful service such as not enough wait staff on duty for the amount of customers, problems in the kitchen, lack of training, etc. None of these factors were present during our recent visit. So I do think they can fine tune their service a bit more. I realize service can be hit or miss at most places and this is only one visit. But, if they are that way with us then I have to assume they are that way with some of the other customers. That's my two cents on the service. The food was pricey but really good.  We ordered the crispy calamari, seared ahi salad, and the BJ's Favorite (aka supreme) hand tossed pizza. The crispy calamari came with two different dipping sauces, marinara and some kind of garlic mayo. Both were great complement to the perfectly fried calamari. The seared ahi salad was probably our favorite of the three. Everything in the salad was really fresh. As mentioned in my other reviews, I'm not a big salad fan but this was really delicious especially the buttery slices of avocado and the tender slices of seared ahi. The pizza was loaded with fresh toppings and came out nice and evenly cooked. I think the crust itself could use a little work, it's got a nice texture but it lacks any flavor. Because of this I did not bother finishing some of the crust.   I had the four 5oz beer tasters for $6.95 which is decent deal.  Mixing it up, I decided to go with the Tantonka Imperial Stout, BJ's Porter, Piranha Pale Ale and Hopstorm IPA. The Piranha Pale Ale was probably my favorite. It was very tasty and sweet for a low abv beer.  On the other hand, the Tantonka Imperial Stout lacked any thickness and seemed very forgettable for this style of beer. For imperial stout, it did not coat my mouth and the coffee, chocolate, etc flavors were lackluster. My wife had the mojito which she enjoyed and would order again.  This BJ's is a solid three stars for me. The food and some of the beer was really good, but it was a bit on the pricey side. When I come to restaurants during the weekend, I do not want to feel hurried. It's the weekend I want to relax and take it slow. This service did not cater to that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=400

Doreen B.,"Grand Rapids, MI",187,399,1850,2.0,6/26/2014,"05/23/2014 It was my birthday on the 25th of May, so my friend Aneita suggested that we go to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse to have a gathering. My husband and I met with 11 other friends as we waited for 1 1/2 hours, even thought we made a reservation. (why makes us make a reservation)???. I did not hear any grumblings from my guests about the wait.... because we were talking about 1. Once upon a time 2. Star Wars  3. Comic Con Past 4. FOOD and then finally the little UFO blinked and WE finally got a table ordered.  Some people got appetizers, some people got an entrée.  I felt bad for one of my good friends because she ordered a burger and she was the last one to receive her food-- even the steaks got to us before the burger. Tracy had mention that the waitress had assured her it was coming and that she was not forgotten. Tracey is pretty easy-going and happy, she mentioned that the was a nice gesture the waitress had done.  I ordered the ribeye with Asparagus and White Cheddar Mash, the whole plate tasted like someone salted it to death. When my friend tasted a piece, she stated that it was salty, but that she liked it.  And... I know that they ask is the steak to your liking... it's a CYA thing. But i cut the very edge of the steak... that part was good. So I tried to scrap off the salt and then eat what I could.  Now the two stars were saved by the waitress and the manager who cut my cake beautifully. For a party of 13, the waitress was very attentive. Now I repeat because I was concerned the my b-day cake would become a Mexican Chocolate Slaughter, however that manager did such a great job. KUDOS to you. We had separate checks so the closing was pretty simple and fast.  *****Tips They have the option to reserve a table-- but beware you're whole party has to be there.  Make sure you taste a couple of pieces of your steak, before the server walks away. They allow cakes from outside of special events. ***This note is an update 06.27.2014 to Trevor something rather he may work or may not work here, or maybe he has a significant other who works here.  I don't know or care. Next time you send a compliment please do not curse at me or put innocent people down. That was really rude, and your curse words are not welcomed in my comments. We paid our bills and tipped our waitress very well. So back off Mr. Rudeness.***  This is why I did not post your comment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=400

For starters it took a while to get our order taken but when we did I ordered the house top sirloin, now I really like my steak well done. When I got my steak I was asked if I would like some A1 steak sauce and I said yes. Well it never came, so after waiting and with no one passing by we decided to just eat. When I cut into my steak it was pink. So when I mentioned this to the waitress all I got was I am sorry. I then asked what happened to the A1 sauce and she chuckled and said oh I'm sorry again. On my bill there was no discount offered. The only good thing that came out of this night was that the Chargers won their game.

Carol M.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",182,20,8,3.0,1/20/2014,"I've been to almost all of the BJs in San Diego and this one had just opened up so I decided to try it out.  Don't get me wrong, I love dining at the other locations but my experience here was not the best.  At first impression everyone was really nice and it seemed like I would be having the usual dining experience I would have had at BJ's but as the evening went on it got worse. Since they are a new location their menu is much smaller but our server failed to tell us that so we didn't know what options had changed from the traditional menu.  My boyfriend always orders the Chicken Parmigiana every single time we eat at a BJs and he always specifies 'the one with the spaghetti noodles' because they have menu items with the same name.  When we saw that they had brought out the wrong dish, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken instead of the Chicken Parmigiana, we kindly corrected them and patiently said that it was okay because this had happened before.  Two things went wrong after this: the foodrunner didn't communicate with the server and so they brought out yet another wrong dish. After bringing out two wrong dishes and ten minutes of painfully trying to explain what the freaking Chicken Parmigiana was, our server finally said 'Oooh yeah I'm sorry, I don't know what that is because our menu here is smaller since we've just opened up'.  (Obviously they hired servers who have no knowledge about their business or their traditional menu). In the end, my boyfriend ate something he did not intend to order at all, it was brought out twice so it was cold, and they basically threw the chicken on a bed of boiled spaghetti noodles with no sauce.  Okay, they tried to make the Chicken Parmigiana but if we had been told that the menu was different from the get go, all of this could have been avoided and I might have given this location a better rating. For now, I would suggest eating at the more established BJs locations if you are a regular and like to order the same thing because their menu here is reduced and the servers, unfortunately, won't tell you that until you've realized that you wasted your time and money..and the company's as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=580

We walked in to about ten employees waiting by the hostess desks...odd, but maybe they were waiting to clock in?!?! We gave the lady the number in our party and she told us to step to the side and wait to be seated. She had lovely eyelids...we never once had eye contact as she was busy typing away. Seconds later we were whisked away by our hostess we gave us a very well rehearsed sales speech about their specials ( i hate the ""our specials of the night"" speeches! It's like a website with flash) i kindly interrupted her to ask where she was from,she was very sweet, handed us our menus and disappeared into the sea of employees. Our first...yes first waitress walked over quickly and I told us her name. She was kind of a blur,either she downed ten cans of red bull or had someplace to be. I noticed a waiter behind her standing with a stopwatch....ummm okayyyyy lol. I guess she was just our drink waitress since we never saw her again. A second chick brought  us our drinks,a third took our order and maybe dropped off our food. All the waitresses were pleasant,not one had a bad attitude, but not one went above and beyond to make our visit memorable. I'm assuming most are still training or perhaps just stalk one another as most had a confused coworker following them.  We noticed a group of workers off to the side just standing.....BJs cult?!?!? Lol  Now for the important stuff.... I ordered their stout... The worst stout I have ever had. It tasted watered down,not strong and full of flavor. Maybe it was an old batch?!? I couldn't finish it.  For food we had the roasted veggie flatbread... It was ehhh. The mac and cheese..again ehhh. As well as the the cookie and cream desert...tasted familiar.

Usually go to the one in La Mesa. We only had a few minute wait. We were seated in a booth. We ordered drinks along with our appetizers and entrees. We enjoyed our drinks but there was no sign of the waitress after we had finished. Ordered another round while we waited. Surprisingly, our entrees came before our appetizers which I was a little disappointed. Food was good, but was not happy at all with service. Maybe saw our waitress 2-3 times the whole dinner.

K M.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,2.0,2/5/2014,"I am  a B.J.'s Brewhouse fan. I have enjoyed each one I have visited, as well as the Food, service, etc. all great reviews.  Carmel Mtn Ranch and Grossmont locations have been great! As I live in Mission Valley, myself and friends were all very excited when we saw B.J.'s coming soon! So we watched diligently for them to open. Then the day had come! We saw tons of people going in, and thought, ""well let's go!"" So we did. We were not greeted kindly at all. We made it into the front door, and were approached by a man that said, ""do you have an invite?"" We said., ""No' aren't you open?"" He said., ""No this is our Test night and invite only"" I have no problem with that except for the man could have been much more professional with his demeanor. So we left not feeling welcome at all. About 2 weeks went by, and we decided we would give it another shot as we were craving our favorite foods from there. So we were greeted very nicely this time. The date was 12/16/13 5:11pm. We had a female server at first, unfortunately I didn't remember her name. I have many food allergies, so I always order about 3 of the same items each time bcuz I know I can eat them safely and they are delicious. So I ordered the chicken flatbread as I always do, told her I had allergies to onions, garlic. So please make sure that their is no sauce. My friend ordered the same and 2 sodas. Simple, right? Wrong, it took over 30 MINUTES to get a soda, we were sitting directly across from the bar, my receipt shows table 805. The patrons at the bar drinking and being loud was difficult to have a conversation at a dining table since they are right next to each other. As I went to get up and go find our waitress, she came out of a swinging door and I asked about our drinks. Sh apologized, got our sodas right away. So she obviously forgot about us. Another 40 minutes went by and our food came out, both covered in Garlic sauce. Are you kidding me! We waited all this time and then it was wrong! She apologized and took it back. A few min later we were approached by Gabrielle, he was now going to take care of us as the other waitress was on a break. He asked what I ordered and he would take care of it, I was stunned at his gesture. I said, "" I already gave her my order and it is suppose to be getting remade already so why do I need to reorder?"" He stated ""he was taking care of us now"" with no other explanation. We were about to get up and leave and then my friend said he needed to use the restroom. Well B.J.'s employees, YOU never know who your customers are. My friend is a ""Health Inspector"". He returned to the table and said, let's go, you are not going believe what I just saw."" He said, ""an employee was in the bathroom the same time he was, as he was washing his hands, the employee relieved himself and walked right by the sink and walked out of the bathroom and straight to kitchen!"" As we got up our food arrived and we said NO Thank you and as we were leaving We saw the manager. So we went to him and explained everything that happened, and also stated we were leaving with out paying our Bill. He was apologetic and agreed. Ya this place is literally 3 minutes to get to, and I will NOT Be a patron there ever again. Patrons BEWARE! Contaminated Food, Servers, and a complete lack of organization is the best description of this experience. I will stick with other locations even driving further.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=680

I mean I had the salad, which was the same I had the first time, but I asked for bread, thinking I would get a couple of little rolls with butter maybe, or maybe some pita bread...anyway, a plate soon arrived with two pieces of toast, no butter. the toast was well done, almost burnt. I said, ""sorry, not having toast with my salad."" it was sent back. another plate soon arrived, along with some butter because I asked for it, and on this plate was two pieces of stale sourdough bread. She said their policy did not include complimentary bread, so I was charged $2.25 for the stale bread. CAROL you could have gone to bat for me and talked to the manager and made an adjustment on the bill, but I guess you were too busy to do so. so sadly, my second experience turned out bad. win some, lose some. it's still a nice place but next time I think i'll try that crab shack place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=680

Kathrina M.,"San Diego, CA",85,37,,3.0,11/16/2013,"Came for a soft opening dinner 11/16/13. The place is a big cube with no windows which is a little disappointing considering it's San Diego and it's always nice out.  We had a set menu which included potstickers for an appetizer and the choice of BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, Turkey Club Sandwich,  Balsamic Glaze Chicken, and BJs Favorite Pizza. We were happy to have good choices. The potstickers were cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce was savory.  The Balsamic Chicken dish was delicious and had an equal balance of chicken mashed potatoes and spinach with crispy onions. The deep dish pizza had a generous amount of toppings and was soft in the middle and nice and crunch crust on the edges. The salad on the other hand was pretty disappointing.  I'd rather pick one up at Trader Joes. It was basically a big bowlful of shredded iceberg lettuce and a couple black beans, corn kernels, and 6 cubes of chicken. Our table agreed it would be the only thing we wouldn't order again. The guys in our party pointed out that their beers did not have the proper head so they appeared flat even though they tasted fine.  Overall, the service was impressive for a soft opening and the food was great, aside from the salad. I'll be back for the regular menu for the grand opening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=640

Chandra R.,"Spring Valley, CA",4,5,,1.0,9/16/2014,"First, let me say I love the restaurant, however this location sucks!!   This is not a review about the food.......because we never were given any.  DO NOT GO THERE BEFORE A HOME CHARGER GAME!! I went there past Sunday before the Charger v. Seahawk game. Right at 10 am when it opened.  I was seated immediately even though I came in with a crowd.  I ordered 2 bloody marys and a water.  By 10:25, the rest of my party (7) had arrived and only had my water (which needed a refill). At 10:30, I got up out of my seat to track down the server to ask if he could get the rest of my table some water and to check the status of my bloody marys.  By 10:45, no waters, bloody marys, or food! There was a large party across from us who although had their drink order still had not gotten any food......they walked out without paying.  We waited 10 more minutes and the manager finally came over at my request.  She said they were short staffed, she was helping out the bar, running around and that she was doing it all on a broken toe. She also added that they didn't expect such a large crowd.  Really??  On the FIRST home game of the NFL football season against the defending superbowl CHAMPIONS???? Really??!!  Her response to the current situation lacked professionalism and frankly, it was unbelievable. This is not a ""Mom and Pop"" restaurant, it's a chain! There is no excuse for the lack of preparation or poor service that was exhibited here. We walked out with about 20 other people who were in the same position and went to Smashburger.  This whole incident was embarrassing since there were so many out of town visitors that were there.......they must think our city is nuts! Thanks BJ's for ruining our pre-game brunch!! Thankfully, the Chargers win made it a great day in the end.  But, I wanted to share with others who may be planning anything at that particular location......know that it is not operated well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=640

We've been here a few times before, nothing terrible, nothing great, but we do enjoy the beers. Once we got to the front, the hostess let me know it would be a 20 minute wait (expected on such a busy day). Our waitress came to tend our table quickly, to which we ordered. I ordered a medium well steak, and my boyfriend ordered a jalapeño burger. Before our food came out, our waitress let us know she was going on break and that Rose would be taking over. When our food was brought out, I eagerly cut into my steak and found it to be Rare-medium rare....I let the waitress know and she was appalled that it was so bloody still. She quickly took my plate and got the manager. I wasn't upset because I know how hectic of a day it was, but the quickly brought out a steak cooked perfectly. I asked for a to go box to take my leftovers, and forgot it (along with my wallet) on the table. Rose ran after us into the parking lot to give me back my belongings which was very nice!

We had been meaning to try it as the restaurant that was there before (Maria Maria) disappeared before we got a chance to go. Anyway, it was a Friday night so it was packed. They told us it would be about a 20-25 minute wait. We were seated within 20 minutes. The server was very attentive, despite having all his tables full. He always made sure our cups were full.  I ordered an individual hand-tossed vegetarian pizza. It was okay, & I have definitely had better. They were very stingy with the bell peppers, but put too many black olives on it. Boo! Also, they need to add sweetened iced tea (not Brisk) to their beverage menu. I had high hopes for this BJs, and I can't give it anything higher than 3 stars right now.

The chowder was fabulous, according to the hubsters. We did have to wait a while for our pizza, but it was great!  We also a red velvet cookie with vanilla bean ice cream (they had some weird word for it.) and it was the best thing I've ever had in my entire life. I'm not even kidding. I could have died and gone to heaven right there. I did read somewhere that the wait staff was still in training, but there had to be a 3-1 ratio of servers to customers.

Colin R.,"Downtown, San Diego, CA",417,109,14,2.0,11/15/2014,"Wow, I'm disappointed I have to write this review. BJ's food and beer is delicious, hence the two stars. Our service (Manuel was our server) was the worst I've experienced in at least 6 months to a year, and I dine out just about every day. We chose the self-seating on the outside patio and it didn't take long for our server to approach. We ordered waters and an appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) and he left. It wasn't until we were half way done with our appetizer that he came back to take the remainder of our order. We ordered the mushrooms appetizer, the bacon corn fritters, and a small 11"" hand-tossed pepperoni extreme pizza. My beer came out about 7-10 minutes later, and our food came out another 5-7 minutes after that. Not horrible but not that quick. Our food was dropped off by a food runner, not our server, who we didn't see for another 15 minutes or so. After a few bites I realized I was given a 9"" deep dish, not the hand-tossed 11"". I asked a random server walking by and she confirmed I was given the deep dish and would get my server. When he came over I told him what had happened, and I said at this point I didn't want to wait for another pizza to be cooked so just charge me for what I ordered and I'll eat what was in front of me. He half-heartedly acknowledged the mistake and told me he'd check the menu for prices and let me know how he'd resolve the issue. Meanwhile we were thirsty as our waters weren't refilled once during this unnecessarily extended meal. When he came back he started reciting prices for ""shareable pizzas"" until I reminded him again that I ordered the 11"" hand-tossed, so to just charge me whatever that would have cost. Fast-forward 15-20 minutes and we're way past done eating and can't get his attention (he seems to be ignoring us at this point). I showed him a rewards coupon I had for a pizookie and ordered that and asked for the check as well. A food runner brought the pizookie and he eventually brought the check, then took another 5-7 minutes to pick it up. I still tipped 15% because I don't have it in me to tip less, knowing I'm taking from what the cooks, expos, bussers, etc. are getting from that, but I wish I could have tipped them directly. Left me regretting that restaurant decision. I had specifically gone to BJ's for the handtossed pizza. They also didn't clear a single plate (appetizers, side plates, etc. until we were leaving). The only defense I'll provide on our server's behalf was he appeared to have been seated several tables at once when we first sat down, but he did appear to receive backup in the form of 2-3 additional servers within 5 minutes of the mass seating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=640

McKenzie D.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/14/2014,"The service was awful! Our server, Nadia, forgot to put our order through so we were sitting at our table for over an hour waiting for our food. When it finally came out, my entree was not what I ordered. Nadia took it away and then about 20 minutes later my dish came out, COLD; as if it had been sitting for a while. The silverware was dirty, the table was sticky and the glasses weren't clean. Once we were done we waited for over 40 minutes just to get our check, then we had to wait another 20 minutes for Nadia to come take it. It was the worst experience I have ever had.

Tori F.,"San Diego, CA",10,25,8,3.0,7/17/2014,"Normally I would rate these guys at a 5 this time not so much.  Our server managed to bring us orange soda rather than cream soda. The wait for the food was not to bad, but my 11 year old had to wait over 10 min after the rest of us to get her personal pizza... we had to wait quite a while for the server when we finished.   When she finally came to check on its we asked for two kids pazzookies to go then say for another 20 for her to take the dinner plates another 15 to get the dessert which was supposed to be packed to go but were not all in all 3 stars for sucky slow service. now if had been busy I would've understood but it really wasn't. Oh did I mention the piece of paper that was stuck on my husbands pizza and the two servers that were obviously fighting over tables. got seated at 6 finally left at 8:30.   Hubby had to go find a server to get the bill. Normally one of my faves after tonight I am going to look for someplace else to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=660

Greg S.,"San Diego, CA",1,25,,2.0,6/13/2015,"Since moving to the college area a year ago (from Escondido), we've visited the Mission Valley location several times. When we first went to this location, the service was great, fast - a much needed breath of fresh air in comparison to the location in Escondido. But recently, we've noticed that Mission Valley has become progressively slower in service and has become what the Escondido location was the last time we went there. Today (6/12/15), which will probably be our last visit, we waited about 15 minutes before a waiter even came to our table. When we did and took our order, it was another 20 to 30 minutes before we got food. At the same time, two adjacent tables, where people arrived AFTER we did, got their food before us and were finishing up while we still waited for our food. I spoke to the manager about the decline in service. She explained that the service issue (on this day) stemmed from a ""transition"" and under estimating the number of people coming to see the women's soccer match. Not sure I buy that because this has been a trend observed during our last 3 to 4 visits when there was no special event. To the manager's credit, she ""comped"" our food order. Hope they get it together - we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=660

Elain L.,"San Jose, CA",55,95,22,2.0,12/28/2013,"Born and raised in San Diego, but currently living in San Jose and I like my San Jose BJs MUCH better than this one. This one is new to the block and I can understand why they put it in Hazard Center... it definitely has a good flow of people from the plaza and Fashion Valley. HOWEVER my waiter was a straight up rookie. I asked for their adult alcoholic version of a root beer... I pointed to what I wanted. I named it as it was listed.... I got plain root beer. That's right you lost out on an alcohol sale. Then I mentioned that our party only wanted dessert... and he goes missing! EXCUSE ME... just because we're only doing dessert doesn't mean you don't have to pay attention to the table. Another waiter had to run our Pazooki order and he never came back... until it was time to drop the bill of course. I have no idea what he was doing because his section was empty. Like seriously couldn't have suggested coffee...or I know some alcohol? LIKE I ORDERED IN THE FIRST PLACE. LAME. I'm sorry I didn't catch his name because he was horrible, I guess it's a good thing I have a much better BJs in San Jose so I won't have to go back to that location for my Pazooki cravings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=660
Eric P.,"Escondido, CA",29,19,6,4.0,2/18/2014,"I often drop into BJs for happy hour which lasts until 7pm. I enjoy their personal pizzas (which are half price just $6) and a cold beer ( only $3.50) . I love their micro beers which they brew themselves. When ordering the pizza get the thin crust. It's larger and as a result you get a lot more toppings that way. I also like the fact that I can keep an eye on the game with their multi screen TV system while I eat. They are still more restaurant-brewery than sports bar but I find it a nice compromise between the two. They only put on the volume during a big game or the playoffs but at least you can enjoy the game while your eating. Dinner service is a little slower than happy hour or the bar and seems to be more hit or miss on the service. Over all I will give them 4 stars splitting the 5 stars for happy hour with the 3 stars for slower, spottier dinner service. The beer at happy hour for only $3.50 I would give 6 stars if I could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=660
Linda B.,"San Diego, CA",34,13,,1.0,12/20/2013,"I took my teenage daughter there for lunch today before going to a salon.  Our appt at the salon was at 2.  We got to BJ's at around 12:20.  We were seated very quickly, which was nice.  I ordered iced tea and they said they just put some on to brew.  The waitress came back with my daughter's drink and then said she had to greet another table and would be right back. We knew what we wanted to order before she left.  She greeted the other table and took orders from 2 other tables that were seated after us before coming back (I had to try and get her attention for that to happen).  It took 20 minutes for us to get our food and mine arrived cold.  When she asked how things were I told her mine was on the cold side and she said, 'do you want me to go back and see if they can do anything?'  I told her at that point we didn't have time to wait any more because of our appt.  She said okay and walked away.  Even my daughter noted that she wasn't a very good server.  She wasn't rude, just not very attentive and not very concerned that we had to wait such a long time for food or that it was cold.  There was also no consideration for the tardiness of the food or the fact that it was cold on our bill.  Due to time commitments, I didn't have time to ask for a manager.  At this point, I can only right a review and say they will not be getting my business again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=660

Michelle P.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,7,5.0,11/21/2013,"I wanted to try out this new Bj's location and I would have to say this is the best Bj's I've been too. I ordered the Crispy Potato Skins and Chicken Tortilla soup last night and they were both good. (I have ordered this before at other locations) I would recommend the soup bowls preferably in Calm Chowder. (I didn't even know they had bread bowls until I actually scanned the menu and it is literally the best bread bowls here) There Pizookies are okay, there too sweet but its worth trying. I don't recommend eating one by yourself lol I did that the first time I got it in Red Velvet. Also the service here is quick and they ALWAYS check up on you! I would definitely come back to this location and it looks fancy vs. all the other Bj's location I been too... PS. You guys should put your phone number on your YELP because we were trying to get your number off here to call for reservations last night.

Kellie P.,"San Diego, CA",76,3,,2.0,8/28/2014,"Great food, nice casual upscale atmosphere , but very bad service.  Came in for dinner last week and sat up in the bar area (should have sat at the bar bc the service seemed to be great)  at a high top.  The server on duty was the only one working on the floor it seemed, and was running around quite a few tables.  I ordered my wine through him and saw it sitting up in the window for over 10 minutes, after they were delivered he took even longer to take our order.  He was very busy with tables, or what seemed like he should have been considering the volume that came into the restaurant.  Instead, he was mingling with his buddy that was sitting at a nearby table.  I very much thought about complaining to a manager because I was so disappointed in my service  but I am also in the service industry so I held back giving him the benefit of the doubt that he had an off day maybe.  My 2 stars are for my delicious pizokie dessert and good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=660
Rayna B.,"San Diego, CA",61,144,10,2.0,2/15/2014,"I love BJ's and I occasionally stop in when I'm craving a french-dip, so it was ironic that I had not yet made it into the new Mission Valley location, right by work. I was finally craving a french-dip last week and had time to go for lunch. I was seated quickly but had to wait about 15 minutes before someone acknowledged me at my table. I ordered promptly and waited another 15 minutes for my food. Ironically, I talked my self into getting a burger when I saw that they had a really cheap lunch special that sounded good. The burger was fine, except that it didn't have the grilled onions described in the menu. Since my hour long lunch was almost over by the time I got my lunch, I took a few bites before requesting a check and to-go box. Once someone came back with the bill, I handed them my card before they could get away again, since it might take another 10 minutes before they came by to collect my card. Anyway, I was overcharged for the burger because they didn't give me the lunch special. I told the hostess on the way out and she was unhelpful but apologetic. She told me she could try to get a manager if I want, which made me feel like I was making a big deal over a $2 charge. I think she should have insisted on getting it fixed, rather than making me feel like I was creating a problem, and frankly, I didn't have time and didn't want to feel stupid for making everyone deal with refunds over a $2 charge. They should have given me a coupon or something for a future visit, but really, they should just be sure to charge people correctly in the first place. Oh well. I may or may not go back, but this first experience left me kind of bummed and disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-2?start=660
