Catherine B.,"San Diego, CA",117,5,,5.0,1/11/2018,"2 things that earned these guys 5 stars. First, my party's dining experience was flawless.  Our server, Meghann, was friendly,  fast, and answered all of our questions.  I ordered the cherry chipotle glazed salmon and it was both very tasty and healthy.  The rest of my party had different burgers- all were cooked to the specified temperatures and everyone was enjoyed their dinner.  I think the hit of the night was the boneless BBQ wing appetizer, they were so good! Second,  I was a total jerk to the staff over a misunderstanding,  and they handled it like champs.  I have a severe allergy to nuts, but not peanuts. I told my server I had a nut allergy, she came back and said they don't use any peanut oil or anything like that so I should be good. I clarified peanuts were ok wth me (they're legumes, not tree nuts) and she gave me the go ahead to eat the stuffed mushroom appetizer. After eating 2 I realize the sauce on them is a pesto sauce and I panic,  thinking there might be pine nuts (this has gotten me before,  and quite recently too; not everyone remembers pine nuts) and once I realize this my anxiety causes my heart rate to rise and for me to think that I was having a reaction.  I started to walk out, speaking quite harshly to a host about what I thought had happened. Quite quickly a manager gets involved and reassured me that there were no nuts in the pesto sauce, she even went so far as to bring out a comprehensive packet on all of their food allergens. I felt like such a dope, but they were so kind and understanding about it. Thank you BJ's for looking out for my health, your understanding,  and for the great food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3
Tim J.,"San Diego, CA",14,97,131,3.0,1/11/2018,"The food here is consistent but nothing to write home about. It's like an improved TGIF. The place is known for their pizookie desserts, but I think they're just okay and not the bee's knees that so many people think they are. Service is fine--it's not polished but it gets the job done. This place stays open late after most other restaurants close. That's a smart business decision since I don't think there's really much else this place has going for it in the highly competitive restaurant industry. Summary: A reliable plan B that offers the convenience of late-night hours and consistent, even if not great, food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3
Marcela G.,"San Diego, CA",20,25,,1.0,1/8/2018,"worse service ever, this past Saturday at 1pm i went in for lunch, i got seated but no one came to offer me a drink or take my order nor even to greet me, after 7 minutes of waiting who I think was the manager(bald guy  not wearing the black attire) asked me if everything was ok. after i explained what had happened, he apologized, took my order and left, never came back to check if my service had gotten better, a girl brought my salad and that was all the interaction i had with the staff, never knowing who my  server was! i had to leave my table to get the bill which had a mistake and i was over charged. normally the service is great but not this time. horrible, horrible service, very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3
Christine K.,"San Diego, CA",1388,943,1688,4.0,12/29/2017,"BJ's is a decent restaurant for food but it's mainly known for their Pizookies. I didn't know that they actually switched locations but I went with my family. All BJ's restaurants look the same. Staff is nice. So we ordered 2 large pizzas, Pepperoni and the Great White for 4 adults, one kid and an infant. The pepperoni came with a lot of meat. I personally liked the Great White much better. The creamy alfredo sauce had the right anount of sauce to pizza ratio and the roasted garlic really brought out the flavors. We also got a kids - chicken alfredo pasta which was pretty big for a average kid and good. Get the pizookie trio. You can opt with 3 different flavors. I went with chocolate chip, white chocolate macadamia nut and cookies and cream. All delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3
Crystal N.,"San Jose, CA",869,155,431,3.0,11/30/2017,"Mondays are half off pizzas! Their pizzas are pretty decent and you can split two flavors on one pizza. 2 large pizzas was more than enough for 5 girls. Happy hour is also nice because some appetizers are $6 and drinks also have deals. I have to say the food is pretty decent but it's the service that ruined it for me. It took the waiter forever to get us even just water and to take our order. We were outside in the patio so there may be a lack of waiters or people are just not attentive. Everyone is walking so fast it's hard to wave someone down and when you do, they forget about what you ask for and the process happens all over again. The food also took ridiculously long to get out to us- at least 30+ minutes for appetizers! It shouldn't be that hard to make artichoke dip!!! We all just getting hangrier out here. :( Overall all, food is good, but the whole experience just took way too long! And backless stools aren't fun to wait on outside. Not a place worth going to unless you want to wait for expensive food (unless there's a deal or coupon).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3
Sari K.,"LADERA RANCH, CA",482,168,591,3.0,11/8/2017,"Pretty good  California supreme deep dish pizza: alright, nothing fantastic. If probably like another kind.  Cookies and cream & salted caramel split pizookie: the c&c section was amazing and had the perfect amount of sweetness. The salted caramel is sickeningly sweet and wasn't good at all. Unfortunately, my pizookie had more salted caramel than cookies and cream. :'( Frozen margarita w sugar: yum yum",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3
Pratap C.,"San Diego, CA",373,74,246,3.0,8/23/2017,"Another disappointing visit to this branch leaves me baffled as to why certain establishments can't maintain the standard and quality across different locations. This disparity comes to the fore when the difference is in both table management and the quality of food. When a couple of kids are part of a party of four, one would think that managing locating them at a table, getting their orders and serving them their order must be a breeze but these guys surprisingly fell short. Firstly, having a server come by and give a glass of water, much less take an order in a moderately occupied restaurant, should not take 15 minutes.... but it did. Next, if the waitress has an opinion on the order, it should not turn into a tirade against items on their own menu. I've faced this situation in other places and I attribute this to overzealous yet well intentioned behaviors.  But then, when we decide to share dishes or drinks, they suggest giving you free stuff saying that if we decide to share they might as well throw in some free drinks. This reaction might cross a fine line between good service and weird service. Now coming  to the food served on the table, the corn dogs orders were generic enough but flavorful so the kids enjoyed it. The veggies that accompanied them were however not fresh or clean... the celery sticks were not cleaned well enough and the kids complained and we verified the presence of sand... not something we would associate with a good BJ's outlet. The quinoa bowl was average and I would not recommend it as opposed to other items on the menu. The quinoa and rice were under-cooked. The quantity of greens and tomatoes in the dish was way too much and the only saving grace was the perfectly seasoned and cooked salmon it came with. Thankfully, the black and bleu-house burger that we ordered was very good. This is one dish that BJs delivers on consistently and we are happy about that fact. The roasted garlic aioli is such an awesome addition to this burger and it goes very well with the applewood smoked bacon in the bun. Hopefully, as this establishment gets more feedback and gains more experience, the service and the food will improve and match up to what we have come to expect from BJs at other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3
Abby W.,"San Diego, CA",1489,972,759,4.0,10/30/2017,"BJ's caught my attention this month with their $3 pizookie offer. I mean, how can you pass up a delicious deal like that? Since I knew that I would be indulging in dessert, I decided to order a mini pizza and only eat half to save room for the pizookie. I ordered the chicken bacon ranch without the bacon and onions. Basically, I just wanted chicken and tomatoes. My only complaint is that it could use more ranch but otherwise the pizza is nice and gooey. Deep dish pizzas are one of my favorites and this one is pretty good! As for the pizookie, I took advantage of the fact that you can get a half and half and tried both the cookies and cream and the regular chocolate chip. Both cookies were delicious and I especially loved the squirt of cookies and cream mousse on top of that cookie. I wouldn't make this a regular meal because the calorie count has to be through the roof but it's a delicious treat every once in a while!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3
Kimberly T.,"San Francisco, CA",424,67,80,4.0,10/17/2017,"Went to BJs because my friend just came back from her vacation and we wanted to catch up while getting $3 pizookies! We shared the chocolate chunk which was yummy and got an order of fries and their BJs brew house classic pizza. The fries were nice and crisp which I liked a lot, but the pizza was a bit disappointing since I didn't realize the bread would be super thin. It was still pretty good but price wise (about 16$), it's not really worth unless you just plan splitting with a bunch of people and/or don't mind paying for it (think of this as a $16 appetizer for a big group rather than a satisfying meal for 1-2). Atmosphere is great. It's a great spot Togo with a group or just catch up with friends. Service was good for us. Our waiter was super friendly and kept coming back to us and checking on us at good times, which I appreciated.  But ya, def go for $3 pizookies!

Faye L.,"San Diego, CA",515,1213,8810,4.0,6/6/2017,"Friends have been wanting to try out BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse so we finally had a chance to visit (twice) in the last week. BJ's Restaurant is located in La Jolla Village. The brand new building was built from ground up. They took over the previous location that housed TGIF (does anyone else remember eating there when they were younger). I actually visited BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse a few months ago and sat at the bar. I thought the food was mediocre and found the restaurant to be cramped. Fortunately, the last two visits have been better. BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse offers lunch specials Mon-Fri so I took advantage of that on our first visit. They have an unlimited salad and soup combo for only $8.95. Ashley, our server, was the funniest girl. She was incredibly helpful and kind. We ordered: UNLIMITED SOUP & SALAD: - I tried the clam chowder, chili, chicken tortilla, and broccoli cheddar. One word to describe all soups : LUKEWARM. All these soups would have benefited from being served hot.  - mozzarella & tomato salad: AMAZING. Straight up fresh and yummy. The small spheres of cheese were plentiful. The parm cheese and fresh parsley brightened this side salad to another degree. I am in love with this dish. ROOT BEER GLAZED RIBS: - BJ's Restaurant currently has a promotion. Spend $9.95 on any entree and you get a free appetizer on the house. Friend's entree was over $9.95 so we opted for the root beer glazed ribs. The ribs weren't very meaty and tasted dry. The sauce wasn't too sweet but it also didn't taste much of root beer. ENLIGHTENED MEDITERRANEAN CHICKEN PITA TACOS: - I was surprised when the tacos came out served on toasted pita bread. I immensely enjoyed the flavors of these Mediterranean inspired tacos. The bite size pieces of chicken were tender. The red wine vinaigrette tasted tart and refreshing. The feta cheese paired well well the tomatoes and red onions. The pita bread was perfectly toasted and was warm & soft. The chicken was a bit scarce though. CHOCOLATE CHUNK PIZOOKIE: - download their mobile app and get this pizookie for FREE!! The chocolate chip cookie was baked fresh to order. It was thin, crispy, yet creamy with the molten chocolate chips. I liked the thinner cookie.  ...2nd visit... AVOCADO EGG ROLLS: - I was hoping the avocado egg rolls would rival the version I adore at Cheesecake Factory. It didn't. I was worried the cream cheese would be off putting but you could only taste a bit of it. The egg roll wrapper was nicely crispy. There was a decent amount of avocado but that was about it. NEW ORLEANS JAMBALAYA: - friend requested pasta instead of rice pilaf for his jambalaya. It was hearty dish. ENLIGHTENED MEDITERRANEAN CHICKEN PITA TACOS: - I ordered the same pita tacos as friend from the last visit. BUT, our nice server let me sub out the bistro grains for, yes, you guessed it - the mozzarella and tomato salad. Still so wonderfully amazing. Please don't ever get rid of it. You get two pita tacos with the order so it's not a big portion. I wish they could add more chicken but it's satisfactory for the $10.75 price tag. My blog has more detailed review and pics Service was fine second visit. But Ashley, from our first visit, was fab.  Don't forget to have your receipt added to your app in order to earn points. I forgot both visits so had to input the information myself (good thing mom always taught me to save receipts). The menu here at BJ's Restaurant is huge so I would come back to try out more items (or lunch specials). I hope they continue to offer the mozzarella and tomato salad as it appears to be new. Overall, aside from lukewarm soups, the visits here have been good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3

Arlene P.,"San Diego, CA",2108,1086,4233,3.0,2/17/2017,"Had to try the new and enlarged BJs in La Jolla--- they built it over the spot where TGIFridays used to be and just across the parking lot from their old location. I just wanted a place to do work on my computer on a Saturday night and they were happy to have me in their bar.  So that was very nice. I ordered a taster of beer - 2 ounces I think - and a pizzookie.  It took eons for my pizzookie so i finally asked - 30 minutes later-  and I suppose they forgot me! haha oh at least they were nice enough to take it off of my bill.  Unfortunately the pizzookie (PIZZA COOKIE) was still kind of raw when it came and just not like how I remember they used to be... but I was already tired and didn't want to take the time to make them remake it and have to wait around, so I just ate it partially and then left. Good news is, I saved myself some calories! To be fair, it was a BUSY night!  But the servers and hostesses were nice enough. I think I'll consider giving it another try one day.

Steve H.,"Del Mar, San Diego, CA",20,86,89,4.0,2/26/2017,"We come here often for family dinner, and the same for the previous location (now Nordstrom Rack, when they took over the TGI Friday's spot).  The reviews here are accurate, and you probably know what the food is about. I mostly want to warn people away from their BJ's App.  The Android app for loyalty-club and such.  It claims to ""put you on the waitlist' when it does nothing of the sort! The hostess (any of them) at this BJ's has never heard of the app, and apparently never sees the ""waitlist"" that the app uses.  So, you'll be waiting there on the bench for a really long time, even though the app confidently ""confirms"" that you're waiting to be seated. You have to sign in at the front desk to get on the waitlist.  The whole app is buggy anyway, so you're not missing anything.  After trying it three times, it was time to send it to the big Uninstall bin in the sky. On the rest of it, I do appreciate the menu printing calorie counts without secrecy for Every dish.  Some are surprising, in both directions.  The beers are excellent, always.. very predictable/repeatable, so if you find something you like, it won't change on you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3

Staff were good but very busy: The place was packed, with a 30 minute wait for a table on a Friday around 6pm. They have that great system where they text you when your table is ready, so I ran over to Nordstrom Rack while I was waiting to see if I could find a new shirt. Once we got seated, the food came out pretty quickly given home busy they were, and it was tasty. I particularly like the Italian Market pizza. And of course you have to get the pizookie for dessert (which is best described as a deep-dish chocolate chip pizza/cookie with ice cream on top).  The beer, well, it is not my favorite and it seems to be aimed at the average drinker but it isn't bad. On this occasion I had a pint of the Tatonka Russian Imperial Stout (8.5% ABV): It didn't taste high alcohol, but it also didn't taste like an RIS (which I associate with really deep, rich roast, raisin/plum notes, and chocolate-like flavors). It wasn't even as flavorful as Guinness or most other stouts, let alone a typical RIS. It did have a nice stiff head and it was pure dark brown.   I'd go back. The patio looks like it would be awesome on a warm day. I think I'd try to pick an ""off-peak"" time, though, to avoid the crowds.

I think it's because their version uses Tequila and Vodka, so it's like a half-@$$ long island. I should have known better, because I usually like Paloma for being refreshing and boozy, this was not the case because of the BJ's remix.  For food I tried the ""Mozarella Sticks"" which were plentiful and yummy. The Root Beer Glazed Ribs were tasty, meat fell right off the bone with  bomb sauce. I opted for this with a side of brussels sprouts instead of cole slaw. And for food I ate the ""BJ's Classic Combo"" which was perfect and nostalgic because I love their dough, pizza sauce, and cheesey goodness with the topping so of pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms because I haven't had BJ's in a long time previously had been to the Escondido and Chula Vista one.   Overall.

It gets a little intimidating when you first get in, but eventually you'll weave out the pages you'll never order from. Service have always been pretty on point so definitely cant knock on that.

Love what they did with the place, wide open space and high ceilings inside, along with a relaxed outdoor area with open seating and a bar. The staff are definitely still getting up to speed, my table was forgotten and 2 orders were taken incorrectly but the staff were very accommodating and friendly so I don't believe it worth docking a star. (I got a free pizza from the mistake too!) The Hop Pact IPA (collab with Green Flash) is worth a try, though they are currently out (10/08/16). I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls.

Jeff Y.,"San Diego, CA",64,19,5,1.0,9/12/2017,"Great atmosphere, but that is almost the only thing that was great.  We stood waiting for more than five minutes before anyone said Hello. We're finally directed to open seating in the bar area.  Service started off good. Then the drinks were slow being refilled. The hamburger came out, no mustard or ketchup.  And the ""well done"" hamburger was, raw with charbroiled outer layers, barley cooked. Didn't notice until I was almost done or it would have gone back.  The pizza is pretty good. Tea has a good flavor but just didn't fill the glasses often enough.  Splenda had to be requested more than once. Waiter would say right away but you would need to ask twice.   The white Chocolate Macadamia desert was very good.  Not sure I am willing to go back again. Certainly not if I have another choice.  If you are going to claim like you are multimillion dollar La Jolla your service needs to be worth a million not 50 cents I should have left for your tip. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=20

Ibrahim A.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,1,4.0,10/23/2017,"I like BJ's. It's one of the few franchise restaurant chains that actually provide quality food and use fresh ingredients. If you like beer, they do have a very wide selection of housemade brews as well as domestic and local choices, and that seems to be the reason why most people go. However, personally, I have to say that the biggest winner to me personally is their pizookies; it's a cookie and pizza hybrid so if I have to explain why that is an amazing creation I don't trust you. My favorite is the salted caramel pizookie. This location particularly is especially clean and the service is great.

Julie D.,"San Diego, CA",302,107,192,4.0,12/4/2016,"Came here at 10 PM for my friend's 21st birthday and since we're UCSD students, we thought: BJs seems like a chill place to eat.  Read the fine print: Happy hour (10 PM to close) is ONLY at the bar. *facepalm* we were kind of excited about some of the Happy Hour deals such as half off the mini dish and $1 off drinks. The mini deep dish is tiny (like the size of a large woman's hand) and we were kind of astounded that it costed $11+ depending on the type. But thankfully the manager that night gave us the discount after we asked for clarification!  They take reservations so when we walked in, the table was already set up and ready for us. The service was a tad slow but I don't blame them, it's 10 PM (we stayed until almost close) and I'm sure the workers were super tired.  Honestly, The food was like a 7.5/10 due to personal preference but gave BJs 4 stars for pretty good service and decent food.  WHAT I ORDERED. - BBQ Bison Burger: served with Coleslaw. Nothing extraordinary about it. I liked the BBQ with the grassy bison meat. The burger was cooked really well, with some pinkness in the middle, just how I like it.  - Pizzokie Trio: I split this with two other girls and got the salted caramel Pizzokie. Not a fan of this. It was too salty and too sweet at the same time and I swear I bit into a salt pocket while eating this. However, every thing else was so freaking sweet it kind of counteracted the saltiness but I'd rather not go through that haha",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=20
Chee K.,"Portland, OR",63,253,180,4.0,4/12/2017,"This was a really nice surprise. From the outside it looked crowded. It's a nice family friend pub bar/restaurant. Inside there's plenty of TVs and clientele ranges from families, people on dates, friends meeting up. I also enjoyed that they have daily special, we came twice and took advantage of the special on the second day $5 in house beers on tap. The first night was a little crowded but we grabbed a sweet spot on their patio. It was a little chilly but they had heat lamps. I order this most delicious salmon on quinoa salad. It was so fresh and tasty and everything worked together! My husband got salmon tacos on pita, also a win. Our drinks were slow to come, and I had to wave down a food runner to ask for them. There was a kids menu and the kids approved of the free fruit salad and garlic knot.  We also order a most delicious appetizer of fried calamari. Had to stop myself from scarfing the entire thing down. Love crispy fresh calamari.  The second night was a little more subduded. It was our last night in San Diego so I wanted more fish tacos. I order their grilled shrimp and one halibut tacos. It wasn't my favorite tacos on the trip but still pretty good. I also ordered their in house IPA. Weirdly, the beer had no taste. I was expecting hoppy and dry notes but I got nothing.  The service was pretty awesome on the second night. I feel that it's not always consistent but way above average in terms of food, service and atmosphere. Be ready for then book of menu though!

Their lunch specials are really a great value so we all ordered from that menu. I had the chicken baked potato and the broccoli cheddar soup. Still tasted as great as I remembered, the potato was just smaller than I recalled. One of my coworkers had the unlimited soup and salad and he really enjoyed that. It was my birthday, so they brought out a mini pizookie for me, however, they just handed it like it was an order versus trying to surprise me...I can't complain though; it's a free pizookie! Food was great, but service was really slow. I feel like our server was responsible for the entire patio so it took us a while to get water refills and our bill.

My friend called weeks in advance and booked a reservation for a large party (20 people). When we arrived, the hostess said they didn't take reservations on Saturdays and told us we had to wait 1.5 hours to get seated. She gave us a hard time until we talked to the specific worker who booked the reservation. They finally sat us down after 30 minutes or so.

I ordered the calamari appetizer and Asian chopped salad for lunch. I asked for no bell peppers on my salad and was happy they actually did that.  Sometimes places hear you and don't come through with your request.  Overall, my salad was delicious and the calamari was crispy and a great portion size for an appetizer.  I can't wait to come back here again for a sit down meal and try other items on the menu. Also, my order was ready at the time I specified.  That's always a plus in my book especially when you have only so much time to grab lunch.

They have significantly improved their food menu with good vegetarian options. We ordered the flat bread nachos for appetizers and they were really yummy. We ordered their thin crust pizza and it was good - a good change sometimes from the fast-flash thin crust pizzas. I love that they now have mini pizookies. Perfect portion for one person. I got the ghirardelli chocolate one - and it was divine ! They have lot of servers - since the place is new and they are training the staff so might feel a  little uncomfortable - but for us it was not too bad.

In addition to the happy hour deals, there are special weekday deals from Mon-Thu which mitigate the price significantly. I'm surprised that the clientele is generally families and older patrons.

My friend said it best, ""Yup that pasta... taste like pasta."" Bottom line, it's edible and nothing special. Some of the dishes lacked any sort of flavor at all.  Portion sizes were also not a big as I expected them to be considering how expensive the entrees were. Spent about 60$ of OK food to fill just two people and a smidge of leftovers. Yikes.  My server was nice though so I'm giving a star for that. I'm a server myself and I could tell that he was going out of his way to be friendly and accommodating.

I love how close this BJ's is to my house and they have a incredible patio with so many TV's so it's great for game nights! PLUS they have a great enlighten menu too!  I must also say that Sean is one of the BEST servers I've had, not just in Bj's but any restaurant I've been too!

Their menu has changed since the last time I came here (2012), when it was much smaller. The new location is nice, the interior is very modern, and it makes me want to drink and eat a lot, which is a huge plus! They also have a bigger beer selection than before. I ordered the Jambalaya with Fettucine instead of rice..and I was very disappointed. The dish was overly salty and the noodles tasted very bland. I tried mixing it more, but it didn't help much. Service was very friendly. I'm sure this place has good food. I'm going to try and order something else next time. Thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=40

Their servers suck and I will officially never come back here again. (Came here 3 times every time thinking service would be better and failed us all three times). I'm completely disappointed in BJ's today. We came in at 11:00pm, hoping to grab some food and drinks. The server never came by even though we grabbed three different people to try to order the food. We finally got to order two beers after 40 mins of getting seated, but all we could do was stare at the beer that was already out but no server to deliver. This was not a busy day, and the servers should have been able to be attentive but by the time she came by, she said ""I need to close someone else's tap so can you please wait a little more"", in which I responded, we've been waiting here far more than 20 mins now. She still chose to walk away from our table. Eventually another guy server came by trying to cover up the situation. Finally the server that was assigned to our table came by but brought out a dirty plate with chocolates on it... great. Then I thought my wait was over when the food came out, but they got our orders wrong. At this point I called the manager Lileanna over where she so fakely apologized that I decided to give up. Yeah I gave up on this restaurant. Probably never coming by again, unless if I'm ready to wait an hour for our food.

I'm not entirely sure if the staff are all new but when we first dined within the first month of opening - our waiter/server wasn't familiar with the menu and had to flag another member to help her with our order. We received our food, and asked if we wanted any condiments which we said yes. By the time our meal was done, condiments came out....

We came when it was just three weeks new so it is definitely understandable that the staff were still getting the hang out it.  Location is great. Replaced the old TGI Fridays and is across from the old BJ's (now new Nordstroms Rack). The restaurant is smaller but nice and clean. Reminds me of the one in North County. Parking can be a bit cumbersome during busy business hours.  Upon arrival, the hostess told us that we would be seated in a few minutes. However, she did not ask us if we wanted to sit inside or outside...she just put us outside. The waiters that came to our table were very ""fresh"". I don't remember his name but he stumbled a lot on his words and seemed very confused. Another one had brought our food and he just stuck both in the middle and did not say a word. Again, it's still new so understandable that they needed to get the hang of things.  We went with our usual meat lovers pizza and the crispy chicken salad. Both still very good at this location.

Ok - I'm more a Neanderthal than Omnivore but the new Lentil soup was really really good. Almost like a mild cup of chili with no meat. But it was lentils. Not greenish or yellow in color - more brownish so the color and thicker texture made me think of ""chillish"" but not spicy - really good. Big cup.  Followed up with Asian Chopped Cob. Big portion and really tasty. Different chicken seasoning but just as good as the wrap the wife had.  Service was excellent and fast.  Ask for one of Megans tables. Her level of service and attentiveness is one of the big reasons you probably chose to eat out in the first place!!! BTW - paying via their app - worked great.

The half stout half red was surprisingly good, I'd recommend it! Always served cold and with a fresh head. The buffalo wings are good and make for a solid appetizer. Don't expect anything fancy with the wings, they're pretty standard. For the entree I had the spicy Hawaiian chicken deep dish and that was pretty tasty! The bread had a nice crisp on the outside with a soft and fluffy inside. Cooked to perfection. I also tried the newer monkey bread pizookie, and it was great! I'd recommend it.

So, my advice to anyone ordering wings is get them ""naked"" and ask for ""extra crispy"".  I'd suggest that the restaurant manager take a closer look at their process to better render off some of the fat.  Buffalo Wild wings and Dirty Birds do a very good job at it and these days you gotta get your wing game to an A.

Amy S.,"San Diego, CA",25,57,11,5.0,10/16/2016,"Yeah, I'm reviewing BJ's. I am finding it ridiculously difficult to find outstanding service at restaurants in San Diego, and Juan at the newly-reopened BJ's in La Jolla was outstanding. He was extremely attentive and had a great smile while he served us.  I mean, he actually seemed like he enjoyed his job. This is rare! The other staff was amazing as well. There was a server delivering drinks who was just as attentive as Juan. At least two or three others came by to check on us. Again, I have not had service like this very often in San Diego.  Their pizza doesn't ever disappoint. I had the tomato basil, and it has that wonderful, salty, buttery rich flavor you crave in a pizza. My husband had a very nice-looking seared tuna salad that he polished off. He also destroyed the calamari.

James B.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/21/2017,"Well, we met another couple here for a pizza. After perusing the menu, we decided on one of the 'Tavern-Cut' pizzas and the 'BJ-Brewhouse Classic'. The small picture we saw was indicated to be a 16""x10"" with 12 slices. Gee, that should do it for the four of us! Turns out the 16""x10"" is an OVAL with the 10"" at its widest and 16"" at its longest (not a large rectangle as we supposed it to be). And, while it is flatbread, it is incredibly thin. And the topping; what topping? We were looking at the 5-cheese blend but not much of it. And 12 slices; while we thought 3 slices each would be great - turns out each slice is about 2""x1"" (this is a slice?) - kinda bite-size. We didn't think much of the mushroom portion of the topping, either. All in all, a HUGE disappointment as to quantity, just not enough to satisfy four people. Appetizer, perhaps; Pizza, not. And, I would have thought the waiter would have let us know just how small it would be for four people. Gee, and all that for only $15. Oh, yeah, in all fairness, the taste was pretty good for a sample. Don't know if we'll be back to try something else or not (probably not).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=100

Mia H.,"San Diego, CA",158,4,4,5.0,10/2/2016,"Bj's restaurant, new location on villa la Jolla, soft opening day. Oct 1 2016 Pros: friendly atmosphere, modern spacious design, awesome full stocked bar, family friendly, delicious food. Gorgeous open patio. Cons: the location is still around a few construction due to remodeling so parking might be a hassle, but it will done soon. On October 1st, I stopped by BJs on the corner of Villa La jolla for a bite to eat and drinks. It was around 5:30pm,  my flatmates and I live down the street and used to come by to dine with the previous location. When we walked in, the staff apologized for the commotion due to the soft opening and training thier new hires. So, the meals were free but alcohol was charged. What a deal am I right ;). All proceeds went to    a charity, I think it was cystic fibrosis.  We grabbed 3 spots at the bar, chairs were nice and comfortable living, atmosphere was awesome and had a nice relaxing escape with the extended patio. Our bartender was Alyssa, she was an awesome delight. She was patient with our orders, recommended lots of entrees, gave us options on what drinks she can make based on our tastes. We started off with thier homemade oktoberfest, watermelon mojito, and a pink Cadillac. The watermelon mojito was a custom, which I appreciated Alyssa doing. The pink Cadillac was an ultimate martini I definitely recommend, it's my favorite. As an appetizer, we started out with the Flatbread nachos. These were addictive and divine. We couldn't get enough. For entrees we ordered chicken soba noodles with peanut sauce, chicken club sandwich, and a chicken and spinach quinoa bowl. Alyssa was kind enough to grab us plates in order for us to sample each other's plates. Honestly, everything was delicious I would definitely order the chicken Soba noodles and chicken spinach quinoa bowl again. Chicken club if I felt like  lunch.    The prices are reasonably priced. Overall, I loved my experience at BJ'S, my flatmates and I enjoyed this place so much we have agreed we will return every weekend as our hangout (how I met your mother status).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=120

Kaylynn E.,"San Diego, CA",71,1,,1.0,12/2/2016,"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Let me start by saying that I don't think it was entirely our waiters fault. I believe it was the staff and the kitchen who caused us to have an absolutely terrible night. A group of 10 of us arrived at around 8:15pm for a friend's birthday. They said that they don't make reservations and could not accommodate all of us so we had to sit down outside (it was about 53F). We ordered drinks which took a good 20 minutes to get to the table. We then all ordered appetizers which came out without a hitch and then we ordered our entrées. We did not receive our food until 10pm! We kept asking about the food and our waiter said that it would be out shortly and he would keep checking. By 10:15 only 4 people had received their food, two of which were ice cold. Two people had ordered soup(which tasted like it came from a can) and a different blonde waitress came out with the wrong ones. We kindly told her there had been a mix up and she gave us complete attitude. Another ordered a hot chocolate because it was so flipping cold outside and half of the hot chocolate was on the saucer and spilled down the side of the mug. The birthday girl's sandwich came out first. Then her soup and birthday dessert came out at the same exact time after her sandwich. It was so frustrating. The food I personally recieved was decent but honestly I could have made it better at home. We asked to speak to a manager and it took him a good 20 minutes untill he could spare the time to talk to us. He gave us a discount on our meal but it does not make up for ruining my friend's birthday. I will 100% never come back here again.

Kekoa M.,"Pacific Beach, San Diego, CA",96,4,1,1.0,4/30/2017,"The general managers listens to apartments across the street and that is apparently is the tipping point for management. They cannot manage a front of house. A neighborhood bar which isn't closed until 1am... San Diego serves alcohol until 2 am. My group has been in the restaurant since 4pm and it is now 10pm. Our group has had awful service to start with an appetizer every hour until our second waiter was on duty. Hector was amazing!!! He heard our concerns and made them better ten fold. But the FOH manager Helaina Menterz came out and was aggressive and unapologetic. Our server was in control as were we and Helaina cut us off after ""receiving complaints from the apartments across the street as well as tables in the same section."" My group enjoys a happy hour, we also have non drinkers but my group definitely has fun loud friends within. Never once have we had an incident at a bar/restaurant or getting home safely thanks to ride share apps like uber and lyft. There was no warrants for treating us the way we were treated. Our second waiter made sure we weren't belligerent and had water before taking our next drink order and there was no warning that our single party was being too loud for the area that we were in. Helaina was out of line in her accusations and simply was inconsiderate. She completely disregarded that fact that we have had bad service for the first half of the night then cut off for being too loud with out a warning. Helaina had made up her mind before making it to our table. Her disposition on us as a gay couple and the situation of the group being eccentric as a fun loving group is unacceptable in this day and age. We are very disappointed in our treatment since we both have been great customers of bjs for a long time. It's just unfortunate that a company is so closed minded and full of hatred to certain groups of their customers.

They don't have reservations, but something called the ""call ahead list"".. which ended up being the same wait (30 mins) as the people who just showed up at the door. Minus points. The service: was unbelievably uncomfortable. Felt like there were more people working than guests. All the waiters/waitresses were trying SO hard, it made us feel super uncomfortable. We heard one waiter literally repeat the exact same words, in the exact same fake happy tone, to about 5 tables.. felt like we were stuck in some creepy matrix. We don't like forced kindness forced upon us. Minus points. The food: We got the dry sriracha rub boneless chicken, and a flatbread (can't even remember which one), and a kale salad. The boneless chicken was a lot of batter, very little meat. The flatbread was obviously not memorable. Salad was gone in 2 mins cause it was tiny. But, the worst part was after leaving the location. I don't know WHAT they put in the food, and we both had indigestion issues that lasted 2 days. So beware if you have a sensitive stomach or are not used to eating fried foods, and a shit ton of oil.

Abbe A.,"San Diego, CA",13,69,,1.0,3/26/2017,"I stopped here mid afternoon yesterday (Saturday) with my 2 preschoolers because they enjoy the North County mall location and we were all hungry after an adventure at La Jolla Cove. We were quickly seated and greeted by a server and her trainee. We ordered drinks and I asked for a large cheese pizza while we decided what else we wanted. Things seemed to be going well, except they didn't! After a long while (approximately 20 minutes) the server and her trainee returned and I asked about the status of the pizza and ordered a salad. They said they would check on the pizza. The salad came out and we ate it. The problem seemed to be that even though they had only a few tables and there were 2 servers, they didn't have a good sense of what was going on and didn't do a good job of checking back frequently. I think it was this point- about 35 minutes in, that I realized something was really messed up. Eventually a ""kids pizza"" was delivered with the promise of another one coming. I told them that I had ordered a large pizza and not a kids size. At this point the manager came over and we started getting somewhere with the promise of a pizza in about 12 minutes. It was at this point that I considered bailing as my kids were climbing and being kids. They were hungry, heck, I was hungry. They know the drill, they sit down and color and a pizza comes out...but not here. After much time (over 1 hour)- a pizza was brought out. We ate, the servers were not easily found to get our check and a to go box. My concern is that the person training the new server was subpar. She had really poor customer service, wasn't attentive, just didn't seem to care. The manager comped our pizza and I paid for our lemonades and salad. I have never not left a tip even when the service is slow or not great. I was a server for 2 summers during college. I appreciate great service. But I also expect to be treated respectfully and with care. The staff here did neither. I got the general managers card and will be sending a similarly worded email.

I didn't catch her name, but I wish I had to give her props for her service. She immediately took note of my 3 year old and offered us one of the huge booths, knowing that toddlers never sit still.

Didn't even bother to send it back. Everyone's order either didn't come with what they asked for or came with extra of what they requested to not be on there...  Horrible experience. Will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=140
Jeannie C.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,1,1.0,4/29/2017,"This was by far the worst service experience we have had at a BJ's location. It took 24 minutes to get a cup of coffee. The creamer was bad so it ruined that cup. Second cup had the same issue. The server did not come back to check, we had to find her. She was nothing short of annoyed that she was going to have to actually do her job. The kitchen manager, Axel, was able to provide us with a cup of coffee and apologized for the situation. He was doing his best to do damage control for several guests, so it seems dreadful service is the culture of the servers at this location. Again, nothing from the server. She was not concerned or friendly. This was terrible service. She never came back to the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=140
Aubrey W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,32,,4.0,2/27/2017,"Only reason for the missing star was the crowd. We came during the dinner rush and the hostess seemed a bit overwhelmed as the lobby was filling up fast and she was dealing with a customer on the phone before she could seat anyone. We skipped the wait and went straight to the bar. The bartender, Jeremy, was awesome. Great attitude, checked on us consistently, made great beer recommendations (try the PB stout!) and suggested we alter our order to get more bang for our buck. Mediterranean flatbread was flavorful and crispy perfection, you should've seen the look on his face when he saw how quickly we inhaled it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=140
Jay Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,57,4,5.0,5/27/2017,Get the dessert try the cookie ice cream thing. Save room for dessert I'm telling you. Thank me later. The pizza is great also. The pasta is okay.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=140

Joyce C.,"La Jolla, CA",42,33,,4.0,7/24/2017,"I used to go to the old location  a few years ago and it was pretty bad food wise that I have not returned for  a  good few years.  After the remodel and  being in a new location I  took the risk  and I can tell you that the  food is  much better all the way around.   Food is consistent in quality and  also service  is a lot better more attentive.  I like  ho its more spacious too so its comfortable. i think I asked the corporate guy last night if they  changed their cooks   because the cooks  in this new location seem to know what they are doing. Apparently, they said they got better  ingredients so that makes a  big difference. I gotten the  Shrimp Quinoa  bowl twice now and love it. The  stuffed mushrooms   last night were  great wish they were  bigger mushrooms but still yummy.  The Shrimp scampi  was  yummy from what my  cousin said. He also had to fill out the  form for the  dish as they are  trying to get feed back before putting it permanently  on the menu. Did the Pozookie trio  Love the salted  caramel,  big chunk chocolate chip.  Not a  fan of the churro as its only churro and ice cream that's it, no cookie  with it.  Overall very satisfied, overall great food and service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=140
Andrew H.,"Boston, MA",163,1,,5.0,4/3/2017,One of the most friendly services I've ever had at a restaurant! The waiters and waitresses were super eager to help us with anything we needed.

Kit C.,"San Diego, CA",37,3,5,2.0,3/15/2017,Do not order online for takeout- my order was missing one entree and i was not given a receipt. Called the manager and he said refund will go back to my card-did NOT get my $$ back - BAD customer service.

Ciara F.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/10/2017,This place sucks. They have good food but if your ready to spend 4 hours waiting for it be my guest. The waiters disappear for 30 minutes at a time and are super oblivious. They lost our order and we had to wait an additional 45 minutes for them to correct it and then they ended up getting our check wrong 3 times. I came with my 2 other friends and they wouldn't split the check for us. This whole processes was extremely frustrating and instead of a peaceful Friday night I got a stress filled environment. The manager who was at the restaurant didn't even come apologize for the ordeal. It was ridiculous and I will never go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=160
Erlin K.,"Glendale, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/3/2017,"Horrible service...

Kusum J.,"Lancaster, CA",51,1,,1.0,2/27/2017,Giving one star just cause the food was good. Otherwise service was horrible came in here to have a few drinks. The waitress most have some personal issue since I ordered a vegetarian pizza with jalapeño but did I get it no and when told that I had ordered jalapeño on it she said no it doesn't come with it ok but I asked you to put them on it. Instead of fixing it oh I can bring some on the side I didn't hear you say you wanted them. Ummm yes you did cause you said sure. Then I asked for napkins instead was given a cloth with utensils umm I didn't ask for that cause I already have it. Wait there is still more my friend asked for water first of all you should give water to start off anyways unless one says no so I asked for a water also but did I get it? No my friend got hers and I had to ask for it again kind you I had ordered another drink and had to wait for that for 30 mins still no water then she finally came with my drink but no water so I ask again can I please have water yes I'm annoyed now finally I get water but the waitress slams it on the table and leaves with an attitude. All I can say is I'm not having that and she needs to go back and learn how to serve and keep a cool admit when you make a mistake and apologize. I won't come here again. Nor recommend it. I think the waitress was racist cause she was white!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=160

Bambi G.,"Whittier, CA",3,4,2,1.0,11/26/2016,"Worst BJ's I have ever!!! We waited 30 minutes for them to clean the empty table where we were to be seated (I know because I could see the table). They finally sat us and about 10 minutes after we orders it started raining and we were seated outside so we asked the manager if he could move us under the patio where there where empty tables and he said no because they have a reservation coming in 30 minutes. So he rearranged us at the edge of the patio that leaked with the rain and has no side covers!!!This manger was more worried about the customers that where not even here yet than us! Never ever will I go back. Besides the horrible customer service we received from the manager it is the smallest I have ever been to! Very disappointed because we eat at BJ's very often. The only thing good was our waiter sorry I didn't get his name wish I had. He tried to make the best of the situation, very attentive and willing to help with whatever he could! We received better customer service at the McDonald's we ended up after because my children were still hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-diego-3?start=160
