Quyen H.,"San Jose, CA",631,203,624,3.0,12/3/2017,"It's a great place for a glass of beer. There's a large selection to choose from! I was pretty impressed with it!  There's also happy hour that makes everything so much better. I remembered ordering the burger here and I was surprised at how big the burger was! I was able to substitute my fries for a side of salad instead. The waiter had no problem with that at all. Back to the burger, it was so big! I had to use a knife to cut into two in order to even hold it! It was quite delicious though.  There's some other menu items here that I want to try but I'm not sure which ones or where to start! Their menu reminds me of cheesecake factory where they have everything you can ever think of!  Overall, it was just a good place for dinner and a drink with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose
Jasmine P.,"San Jose, CA",122,90,2,3.0,11/21/2017,"I wanted to take my sister and brother in law out with my kiddies.  We waited and the host was awesome!!  The server was pretty great as well but the food took a long time to come out. We were not going crazy about it because we were all in conversation and the kids were talking. So we were having a good time. But hen we realize that we were waiting for 45 min for our food. Then when the food came, some of the items (fries) were stale tasting. Then my sister had to wait a little longer for her plate while we all got ours. When her plate came the chicken was raw in the middle. The waitress we had was awesome, she came to us right when  we raised our hand for her attention. She didn't run the other direction. Once she took back the plate a few seconds later her manager came and apologized. He took it off our ticket and got her a different choice for the night. When it came time to go and get the ticket, it was not updated and the manager came right over to fix it. We were okay with everything, it was not great but i liked how the manager and the waitress were very nice and tried to fix any oops they had!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose
Sophia T.,"San Jose, CA",183,12,6,1.0,11/5/2017,"We made reservations at 5:30PM. We waited for an hour, and our server was nowhere to be found. It's currently 6:30pm and I am fuming simply because we made this reservation and my mother has diabetes, so she has to eat on time. Thank you BJs for celebrating her birthday by not actually serving us and leading her to have a hypoglycemic attack in the middle of the restaurant. We ordered a soda, which came 40 minutes late. I am very, very upset, and me and my family will never come back again. This dang place almost costed my moms life, and I have never experienced a worse experience. I sincerely hope BJs fixes it's terrible service, because I will sue next time I step foot in here. We also had no apology for the wait, and the servers were blatantly rude and terrible to us and I'm still in shock as to how all the servers were irresponsible. This place is horrible. Horrible.  I'd rather die than come back. Honestly. Not to mention the staff was extremely racist to my family, thinking that we could not comprehend the American language, and ignored all of our requests. Thank you once again, for the racist, horribly slow, and disrespectful service! I wouldn't even give this place a star, and I would give it a - 7 if possible. As for food, the brown rice is uncooked, cold, and very unappetizing. Everything is not even lukewarm because they didn't even have the decency to bring out food on time. (I also requested for this to be brought out as soon as possible seeing that my mother had very low blood sugar. This was brought out 30 minutes late. And we got cold food. Really.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose
Ria A.,"San Jose, CA",435,68,382,3.0,10/14/2017,"This location is 1000 X better than the one on Coleman ave! If you prefer not to eat in a pitch dark restaurant, this location is it!  We've always gone to the BJ's located on Coleman avenue and did not even realize this was close by! Every time we've gone to the Coleman location to watch a game, I've felt as if I were seconds away from falling asleep! The place is so dark and made me feel instantly sleepy! Maybe I'm just weird..Anyway, if you like light, go to the Blossom Hill location.  This location also has a large parking structure next to it as it's right by the mall. Parking is never an issue and I love the out door seating area. As far as food and drinks go, it's typical bar/chain restaurant food. It's a great place to watch games and grab a quick bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose
Kathy N.,"San Jose, CA",447,40,77,1.0,9/24/2017,"WORST SERVICE EVER. My cousin and a friend booked a reservation here for a party of 16. The day or two before, they called again to confirm the reservation and add 1/2 people into the reservation. Well, BJ's said the reservation was never made?? The day after we called again and they said they still have our reservation?? Alright. OUR RESERVATION WAS 5-7PM. We ordered about 5:15. TELL ME WHY DID EVERYONE'S FOOD COME FROM NEARLY 6:40 - 7:40pm?? We waited OVER an hour for our food. We had creepy guys recording the girls, the staff kept saying the food is being made, and the food was suddenly being made AFTER our reservation ended. The food that came out for most people was not even hot. We all sat there incredibly hungry, waiting OVER an hour just for food. And quite honestly, bj's food was all show and not QUALITY. My friend's pizza dish made getting pizza a struggle. My vegan lentil soup was warm and looked like a dog took a dookie lmao. My other friend's salad was 1/4 of a cabbage + dressing LOL.  Some people ate super early, some people ate super late. My poor cousin had to wait for over two hours for food. Staff apologized after over an hour and a half and said they are finally starting on my cousin's dish WHEN BEFORE they said they are currently cooking it. What??  We didn't get a discount, nothing. We finished eating and doing everything around 10pm at the restaurant. Unbelievable. Never coming back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose

Weekend day with big families waiting for a table but if you're a table of 2 odds are you'll be taken quickly. This was the case of Scott and I. First table by the door. Anyone who knows me knows I hate when my appetizer comes with my entrée. So what happens? Our calamari came with our split Parmesan crusted chicken entree at the same time. Not only did the calamari come with our entrée, but it also came stone cold. Our waitress wasn't even the one to deliver our food. So, I'm left to believe the calamari was sitting at the window and she never gave it to us or the cooks just have cold calamari waiting to be served. Either way is unacceptable. Yet, the entree was hot. Pizookie was the saving grace. Oh BJ's, why you do dis?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose

The food doesn't taste like it's 500-800 calories and it's filling. Their fries are one of my faves. The staff at this location is so attentive and is always making sure you're doing okay. They also have daily specials and I believe Tuesday is $3 pizookies!! Download the app because you can put yourself on the waitlist and it'll help save time.

Dessert was ordered but never came...and waiter was nowhere to be found. Should have taken the hint when he  vehemently declared chocolate was the only ice cream available...Many folks well behind us were happily getting their VANILLA ice cream melting over pizookie.  Utterly disappointed and felt like IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME...WHY DID WE EVEN GO THERE...NEVER AGAIN!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose

Fantastic weather that day. *We noticed that the guy who sat us ... came back immediately and took our order, because our server was very busy. He answered our questions about the boneless chicken wings. He took our order ... then our server Sabrina came by and took the handoff. Great cust service. I had the mini pizza, BJ's fav, she had the boneless wings. Her wings were over cooked, very dark color and a little tough ... but my pizza was just right, very light and well balanced. A quick bite and it was off to see a movie. We've been to other locations (Marin County), where the service was hit or miss ... but we liked it here in Oakridge Mall.

Okay, I don't mind waiting a few minutes but to have no one come by to offer at least water or ask ""have you been helped"" after sitting for 10 mins is just not okay. Multiple employees passed by and no one cared to say a word. Not until we got up and were heading out.

They do have a great selection of cocktails and beers, and there is something for everybody on the menu.  They have deep dish personal pizzas, which are actually pretty freaking amazing! I might be back just for these.  Of course they have great desserts too...everybody loves a pizookie! The baked beignet is pretty delicious as well.

David N.,"San Jose, CA",5,113,168,3.0,10/19/2017,"I gave up on their generic bar food shortly after the place opened a few years ago, but heard they revamped the menu and wanted a decent draft beer while at the mall for lunch so gave it another shot. The Hop Storm IPA was the best part of the meal. I had the lunch special BACON-GUACAMOLE DELUXE BURGER, for which I'll review the elements: Bun: Very good lightly toasted brioche-style bun. Chipotle mayo: Far too little of it squirted on the underside of the top bun. Guacamole: About 1/3 of it was dark and rotten. Applewood smoked bacon: Didn't taste any smoke flavor and it wasn't thicker than regular bacon as it should have been. It was also old and not hot enough, clearly having been made long before the burger. Red onions, tomatoes and jalapeños: They were under the burger, but too mushy and sparse as compared with the menu photo. Pepper jack cheese: Didn't see or taste any pepper - it just looked like monterey jack. It was also cold and not melted onto the burger at all. Burger: Decently seasoned and cooked medium as I asked, but it's definitely low quality beef. Not sure how to accurately describe its texture and mouth feel but chewy, dense and slightly sinewy come to mind. Also clearly smaller than the one pictured on the menu. Fries: Okay-tasting and crispy but barely warm and about half the amount pictured on the menu. Overall not a bad deal for $10 but I think the kitchen has execution, temperature, and material quality issues to address.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose

I ordered the breakfast pizza.  Pretty good with eggs and bacon. I also had to have coffee as it is a very cold day.  Too cold for late December here in the Silicon Valley.  Good coffee. Yes, not kidding. The service is the only thing that is a hit or miss.  The waitress provides good service one minute and not so good the next minute.  Took a little too long to bring me a refill on coffee.

BJs was a solid zero stars for me.  It's up to a 3 because we went the other day (only because my husband got a gift card there from someone).  I was dreading it but it ended up being fine. I didn't get sick, we didn't find any hairs, dishes/silverware/glasses were clean, service improved, and food was edible.  Is this the best place ever?

My most recent few visits to this location have been satisfactory but, I had stared to notice that the bartenders here give preferential treatment to customers from what I overhear are employees at several surrounding restaurants. P.F. Changs, Bucca Di Beppo to name a few. Well It seems that my needs fall on the back end of those work nearby. I watched several bartenders (both Caucasian looking males) interact with said customers by giving out shooters and beers to them, while every time I asked for another beverage my receipt was immediately updated but it seemed that the local employees were getting freebee after freebee. Which to me doesn't look great when I feel that I spend enough money there not to be included in this generosity. Regardless the interaction with my bartender (Randy C.) was minimal and felt disingenuous. In short I didn't enjoy watching this happen and will recommend others avoid the bar top unless they work in the same field in the surrounding area.

The manager did try to get us to stay but at that point I had already had a bad taste in my mouth. I grew up in the area and loved eating at BJs. If it was busy tonight I would have understood.

Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",971,2329,3797,3.0,11/29/2016,"2nd time dining here, and on a rainy Saturday, the service was beyond subpar. We were seated by the hostess, but the booth seats were dirty, and had to ask for it to be wiped down before seating. My friend and I went with the 2 for $25 deal which included 2 salads (the salad we chose - mozzarella and tomato, wasn't on the menu?) , a medium pizza and a pizookie. I ordered a soda, friend had a hot water. Our salads came and when we finished, we pushed our salad dishes to the side, but never got picked up. Our pizza came and I asked for a refill on our drinks and ranch, and 15 minutes later, still nothing. Finally flagged down our waiter and he brought it back when we were pretty much done with our meal. Salted caramel pizookie is missing the salty touch, but good regardless.

However, I actually like this place. Staff can be a bit of dumb dumb's at the entrance, but the service is normally pretty good. The bar staff also needs to hurry up as there seems to always be a delay.  However, they were able to make the grilled burger melt for me, which is no longer on the menu, which gives them a lot of bonus points. It's amazing! Also, they have one of the stronger Long Island ice tea's in the business of big restaurants. It's really good and strong. Makes you grow hair on your arms.

I've ordered   from here previously and I raved about it. Ordered and this is literally what I got on my so called half-ass nachos.

Timothy N.,"San Jose, CA",108,63,48,4.0,10/24/2016,"If this was a dessert place with their pizookies I would give them 5*s for that alone. It was that good and I can't believe I haven't had a pizookie before. I'd come back just for that. Nonetheless, they are a restaurant and so there are other things to judge. This placed is packed on weekends and that really sucks but if going on a weekday most likely you'll be seated immediately which is nice. One really minor thing I saw and that I see noted in other reviews is that I felt like I was interrupting the front staff when we came in and I totally understand talking during down times as its normal in any job, but perhaps there can be a way to be both productive as well as socializing with co workers instead of just having a little circle with backs against the door.  I don't remember our waitress' name unfortunately but she was really attentive to our needs and always checking up on us as well as being enthusiastic even though there weren't that many people in the restaurant yet which is always a plus as having superb people skills regardless of it being busy or not is important.  For appetizers, Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts. Now let me say I dislike Brussel Sprouts normally and that summed up my first bite. I took a random one off the side and I didn't see any difference from a normal Brussel Sprout. Turns out the sauces on the bottom wasn't in the particular area that I took my Sprout from so I was missing out and just eating a plain Brussel Sprout. After noticing that, the Brussel Sprout in the actual Honey Sriracha sauce is actually pretty good without being too overwhelming or filling to prevent me from eating my entree. Now for entrees I mainly wasn't that impressed because I didn't really see anything special in my deep dish ziti. It was good no doubt about that and the garlic knot was an awesome add on as well but I wasn't just super into it.  Overall desserts are bomb and pretty much the one reason I'd come back and makes this review a 4* versus 3* as I'd personally have it around 3.5 if I could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=20

Food took a little longer than usual which was expected. My pizza was fine. Hubby's burger was a little over cooked and it didnt have any thousand island dressing on it. The fries were also cold and in short supply.  We let our waitress stephanie know and she took care of everything she got a fresh plate of fries and grabbed the thousand island dressing.

Mac C.,"San Jose, CA",6,68,62,1.0,10/12/2017,"The staff here just doesn't care about their customers. So many times we tried to flag down servers to help us out. Even spoke to people that weren't servers who were just laughing and speaking with each other not caring about their customers at all. Others were on their cell phones again not caring about their customers. And when we tried to get their attention it was as if we were disturbing them! Look you are here to do a job. If you don't like your job, don't do it! But don't male a family wait for 15-20 mins without acknowledging them! We waited so long for our waitress. She even left the check three times as she passed by not taking the check with the cash already on it! Three times! She forgot that she even left us a check the other two times and they aren't even that busy! The waitress couldn't even find change for us. She stated she was trying to find change. Really?!? Wait...you are a restaurant right? How do you make a customer wait for change of all things... Bj's have definitely reached an all time low! I remember when this place used to have great service and food. Now the people here do not care.  MODIFIED: The incessant rude messages I was receiving from other employees and people commenting was slightly getting off point. So I modified this review to bring it back to its main focus.  A servers job is difficult. I'll give you that. I myself used to work as a server at Pizza Hut when they used to host people. But customers sitting waiting to be served while ignored by staff for over 20 mins upon entry and at 15-30 mins during the the meal at different times I may add is unacceptable! Period.  This is to all the employees here, if you are one of the few that do treat their customers with respect and attention then you are one of the lucky few...To the rest, if the people here don't enjoy their job and feel as if every time a customer asks for something that they are being disrupted, please go and find a job in a place that allows you not to be customer facing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=20

However, One of our cookies was pretty burnt and we could taste the charred cookie even with ice cream and caramel all over it.

We recently signed up for an on line account with BJ's and took advantage of their ""wait list sign in"". It informed us that there was a 45"" wait. We arrived at 3 minutes prior to that wait time expiring, having put my name in at 2000, we arrived at 2042. I informed the host of our name and he said he had us ""checked in"". I asked how long we might now expect to wait, and he said it would be 30 minutes! He then proceeded to show me his wait list screen and told me there ""were lots of people ahead"" of me. On the list, there is a phone icon next to names that have made online wait list requests. There were none of these ahead of our name. Only walk ins. What a horrible on line system. To be fair, the online system does state there will be a wait time as you arrive, so I expected a 15"", or even 20"", being Friday night, extension. I fail to see the point of having an online system at all however, if my walk in time will be the same as my online wait list time and time estimate given. Utter customer service failure before I've even engaged your restaurant.

Beer I've tried and liked: ALL OF IT DANG IT. And they offer 4 oz pours for lightweights like me who would spend the afternoon sleeping off a full beer. The one thing I'd steer clear of is the calamari. It just is not tasty, and it's soggy AF.

He's that kind of person and personality that's successful and ""living life to the fullest"" wherever, whatever he's doing. Two of our kids wanted food too, but they were at home. So aside from the in-house dining which was awesome, we had to order take out. Paul had the attention to ""time"" the take out orders. (So that the dinner was hot when we arrived home - and the dessert still cold, etc). They were difficult take out items. We noticed that Paul took the energy and focus to put the take out orders in such a way that it could be enjoyed really well at the house too. He remembered our preferences with sauces and what not. If something was meant to be cold or frozen, he separated them from the hot foods.  Just really impressed. He has an attention to detail, works hard, and also shows he loves what he's doing. When the kids opened and ate the takeout, there was that sense of care from Paul. He didn't just serve us and throw us away after we gave the tip.

My boyfriend and I came here again to celebrate him getting a job.  I started with an order of the stuffed mushrooms and they were these teeny itty bitty things. And there was very little filling inside. He ordered the pull pork sandwich. It tasted as if they just smeared McDonald bbq on the pork and the fries were soggy. I ordered a mini deep dish bj Classic. It was terrible. The pepperoni was all stuck together, barely any sauce, giant lumps of sausages and it was all cramped in the middle. The entire pizza looked like a sink hole.  Another sad point is that they got rid of my favorite chicken limone, pot roast, and meat sauce spaghetti.

An hour in, we went to check to see if we are close and they told us they had us down for 4 instead of 7 people! How the hell did that happen? I have no clue but my guess is they are busy and the people that are working could care less. So even though they made a mistake they told us it'll be another 90 mins. At this point we told them to cancel it and we walked off. Ended up eating at the food court because we are now starving. Bjs have decent food, I mean but nothing worth waiting that long for.

That said, they did an absolutely superb job both on food and service.  I asked if they could make their jambalaya without onions, and they did, while also making sure to take a backup order from me in case what I asked for could not be done.  The jambalaya...absolutely great.  Plenty of proteins in it, with the right amount of heat and flavor.  And so much of it that I couldn't finish it all.  I don't usually take leftovers home, because most of the time I eat up all the ""good bits"" at the restaurant, or else it's just not quite a good enough meal I wish to repeat.  But I made an exception in this case...it was that good, and still had a lot of meat left in it after I'd eaten my fill, that I wanted to take the rest home...and actually was looking forward to eating the rest the next day.  And it was just as good.  They did a great job on the service as well, checking on us repeatedly to make sure our drinks stayed filled...important for the jambalaya dish because of the heat.

Alex B.,"Oyster Point, CA",47,24,,2.0,5/12/2017,"I used to love BJ's. As far as beer goes, it's hard to find a restaurant with such a fine house selection. If this place was just a bar, I'd have to give it 4-5 stars. Unfortunately, food and service are major factors and the service at BJ's suffers more and more as the place crowds. The servers don't particularly seem to care how well your experience goes, but of course, there are shining exceptions.  The food is decent for the most part, with some sad dishes. I've eaten at BJ's at least forty times, and I notice their appetizer portions are shrinking while the prices go up. I used to enjoy the lettuce wraps with Chinese mustard, but they don't give enough filling to fill the wraps anymore. The avocado rolls come in smaller portions; they used to be much more substantial. I do recommend the chicken wings and the flatbread pizzas. While appetizers seem to get progressively smaller, contrarily, entrees remain gargantuan. Nobody complains about getting too much, but prices can be lowered with reasonable portioning. An entree should be just enough to fill a stomach and not require the aid of a second. There's something about enjoying a dish and not being stuffed silly that makes it more memorable. Go to BJ's for exceptional beer and high-end bar food, but always keep in mind: it'll cost more than it's truly worth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=40

Came in around 8pm on a Friday night and was told there was going to be 1+ hour wait. I liked that they took down our number and would text us when our table was ready. An hour passed though... no text message. We came back, asked, and was told there was just one couple ahead of us. Finally got seated. For the first time we got a server who was friendly and very attentive. Our drink orders were taken immediately. Hefeweizen for the boyfriend and orange cream soda for myself (with refills). I highly suggest it! Next time I want to try their new soda cocktails. Ordered the calamari (had to give it a second chance) for an appetizer. Again it was a disappointment being drenched in SO much oil. If you don't mind oil dripping off your fingers and face - I guess it was a decent dish. I, however, did NOT think so.  Boyfriend got the brisket bacon burger (I know, I know - heart attack in between buns). Came with choice of fries or potato wedges. I'm surprised they didn't offer a cold slaw side dish. Burger was good. The brisket was absolutely delicious. Apparently the kitchen misread the ticket and gave away my jumbo spaghetti and meatballs to someone at the bar, while I got a shrimp pasta... Sent it back of course. Took another 15 minutes before I got my meal and by then my boyfriend had long finished his. The meatballs were definitely jumbo and I did enjoy them. But the sauce was too runny and the worse part was how extremely spicy it was!!! After a few bites I just couldn't take it anymore and it became inedible.

Monika H.,"San Jose, CA",421,102,172,4.0,6/10/2016,"We stopped at this BJ's restaurant to watch the Warriors-Cavaliers play Game 4 of the NBA Finals and to sip some beers.  The game was shown on the big screen TV near the bar, and we lucked out on getting some seats (eventually) at  the  bar. The crowd definitely was in to the game, which made it fun, and the beers were good.  I had a peach ale (the name of which I cannot remember) and my guy had a ginger IPA (""Devil's Brew""?).  We also split a jalepeno burger (substituted with a turkey patty) and steak fries. The kitchen apparently was REALLY busy.  So, the fries came out separately from the burger, but it was fine. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves tremendously, particularly because the Warriors won!

Charles A.,"San Jose, CA",7,50,5,4.0,6/23/2016,"First of all, my wife and I don't drink alcoholic beverages which makes our appearance at BJ's seem out of place.  They do have some very tasty menu selections though. We frequent the 3 restaurants in the South Bay area and find that the food is very consistent between restaurants.  My wife loves the salmon and quinoa dish while I like the chicken and pasta dishes.  Their hamburgers are very tasty.  They have several very good dinner salads made from fresh ingredients.  Their pizza selection is excellent considering that it is not an Italian restaurant and the Tuscan Tomato Bisque soup is my favorite. They have a diner's reward program giving discounts when a certain point level is reached. My biggest gripe is that since I don't drink alcohol, I really enjoy a good glass of their Tropical Iced Tea.  They used to have it available on a regular basis but in the recent past, its availability has been shaky.  They promise that is NOT off the menu but every time we're there, they say that they are out of it.  Their regular iced tea is not so good and drinking just ice water leaves me dissatisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=140

The restaurant itself was quite spacious, loud and had a lively atmosphere.  It's the kind of place where people go for casual food and drinks with friends and family.  The service, however, was below average.  We didn't see the waiter again, after our food was brought, until he handed us our check at the end.  The food wasn't that great either. So yes, finally, onto the food.  We decided to go with their specialty deep dish pizza.  Surprisingly, this dish didn't take long at all.  Served on an iron stand, great for sharing, and gosh did it look yummy!  Sadly, it was false advertising as it didn't taste nearly as good as it looked; it was dry and the pizza wasn't even hot...more like room temperature. I didn't dig the angus beef dip sandwich either.  The beef felt all mushed up and the dipping sauce was too salty.  The skinny fries on the side, though, were decent. As for their chicken artichoke pasta?  Yum, we have a winner!  I thought their pasta dishes were pretty solid so If I were to come back and eat at BJ's again, I would probably just stick with them....and beers, hehe :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=160

What was totally lacking was communication and service.  I had signed a contract specifying the meal (it was provided by a BJ's manager, not by me) but the night of the dinner, BJ's didn't know what I had ordered.  Fortunately, I had a copy of the contract to show them.  It didn't make the order right (since the chicken came as a single portion--hard to serve 25 people from a single portion)--but BJ's did correct it finally.   Getting sodas, water and coffee was slow and problematic.  As was anything that required a request (like a plate).   As bad, although not all BJ's fault, was sitting outside.  It was warm enough on a cold night but the wind blew the plastic curtains around and the weights holding them banged against the walls so the place sounded like garbage can lids were rolling around.  I'd suggest considering other venues for large groups (the only place this BJ's has for large groups is outside) in bad weather or when the wind is blowing.  When the wind died down, the outside area was pleasant enough.

Christian T.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,2.0,10/20/2015,"I've been dining out to bj's quite often lately so I couldn't help but write a review for this location. On a side note, I found the restaurant's renovations cool.  Alright, so from walking in, the hosts sat me and my family ( or friends) in a timely manner. Nothing too long of a wait.  Food is pretty good, I'll give it 3.5 stars. I love the ""best beginnings"" appetizer as its a ton of appetizers in one. I also like the balsamic chicken and the meat lovers pizza. The guacamole burger I tried one time though was extremely salty.  In terms of service. I feel that the servers just need to be more attentive. The few occasions I've come here, the servers I have had take long to either take entree orders, get water refills, or even drop/pick up check. I could understand if the server was busy, but I noticed each time that we were one of, if not, the only the tables in their section. Coming from someone who works at a restaurant, water refills shouldn't take 10 minutes. But either than that, pizookie's hit the spot and will always keep me coming back to bj's.

Harsha G.,"San Jose, CA",531,562,1335,4.0,3/29/2013,"Was here with 3 other colleagues from out of state for lunch(none of them were familiar with BJs :)). All of them had never been to a BJ's and I was playing host. A couple of us drank and lunch special prices were a steal! A pint cost us only $3.50. One og us had the blondie (one of the popular beers that are brewed here) and I got the Nutty Brewnette, quite balanced. we ordered the appetizer sampler and I was pleased that my favorites avocado wrap and the mozarella sticks were a hit with the group.  One of us had Lactose intolerance and he was quite happy getting the chicken tacos for main course and he not only liked the tacos but also enjoyed the accompanying black bean chilli. Another friend had the quesadilla and he liked it too. The remaining two of us got a pizza and you can never go wrong with any of their pizzas.  We ended our meal with a trio pizookie 9 - got the chocolate, red velvet and cookie dough kinds. The red velvet cookie was way too sweet but we all enjoyed the pizookie nevertheless. This particular BJs seems larger than the ones' in newark and san mateo. It was also packed during lunch. However, we walked in around 1.30, hence didn't have to wait too long to get a table as most people were finishing up lunch around that time. The service was excellent. Our plates were removed perfectly after each course, our water was refilled perfectly and our waiter was very efficient and told us exactly in how much time we could expect our food. Food wasn't expensive and it came upto $16/person including tip calculated at 20%",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=180

Our food came out the burger was good but the fries were pretty cold and my brother got a cold baked potato and had to wait for his fries to come out 10 minutes after the rest of his meal based on this I would not be returning any time soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=180

We were seated quickly but it took one of the people in our party to speak up to even get a server and then brought our drinks only to disappear for another 20 minutes, this time we had to speak to the assistant manager to get our server to return. The server passed by on at least 20-25 tines without acknowledging us or refilling the drinks.

Brenda L.,"Syracuse, NY",970,1932,3488,4.0,7/8/2015,"BJs is awesome. The ambience is cool & the menu offers a ton of items like burgers, pazookies, sandwiches, tacos, salads, pizza and cocktails. Hours are great & the space is huge. They do curbside takeout like Applebee's does & they offer special menus (kids, gluten-free). You can order online & even get catering services for your next event. I tried a flatbread pizza appetizer here that I thought was really tasty. The CA club flatbread came with grilled chicken breast, smoked bacon, tomatoes, mozzarella, roasted garlic aioli and diced avocado. They're open until 1AM on Fri/Sat & midnight on other nights. This place is always a great option for when you ""don't know where to go"" or when you have a big group of people & you're trying to accomodate to everyone's particular taste in food.

Sal G.,"San Carlos, CA",141,34,9,2.0,9/23/2016,"The only reason why I'm giving 2 stars is because of the following: 1.) I dont know what it was but every time they opened the door it smelled like straight manure. It was so awful. Right when I was about to say something, a family asked about it and asked them not to open the door but of course the waiter was rude to them and gave him sass ""well how am I supposed to serve the people outside huh?"" I was pretty upset.  2.) when we got in to ask for a table they said this ""great, just enter your phone number and we'll text you right when your table is ready!"" So we decided to stay nearby in the mall and walked for a bit. When we got our text we walked back but he said ""oh sorry you didn't come in the 5 minute limit that we have so you have to sit down and wait."" That made me really mad because they did NOT say anything about a 5 minute limit time. So shame on them.  3. Sal was great though.

Since the main office was closed for the holiday, I had to call the following day (today). After a short but productive conversation with Jeff Bowers, he reissued a new card. We decided to once again have lunch at BJ's. The manager, Amanda, recognized us and asked if we were able to get things resolved. We informed her we had, but jokingly stated the main office told us lunch would also be on BJ's. To our surprise, when we got the bill, there was no charge.

I waited a long time for a rare steak.  I tried to eat it but it just wouldn't go past my esophagus.  So our waiter took it back to the kitchen then came back with that same steak, now medium well, and burnt on the outside.  If it weren't for my sister who's visiting, I would've happily gone to Chipotle and gotten a steak bowl.   I've been to BJ's a few times because of the pizookie and the long wait is not unusual.  I don't know if it's just me turning into a snob, but it seems that the quality of their food is deteriorating.  Yes, I am aware that this place is not exactly a steakhouse. But still.  (the pizookie earlier was also oily). So, in the end, our waiter took the steak off from our bill.  I was happy for a couple of minutes until I heard him say that the neighboring table's mojitos are free.

Veronica B.,"San Jose, CA",2,31,1,2.0,5/14/2015,"I'm done with this place. I usually drive to this BJs over the one that's closest to my house because I usually get excellent service here...whoops.  My boyfriend and I usually come to BJs late at night on weekdays because I work late. So there's no wait to be seated, we take a seat in the bar as usual. It was a Tuesday a little before nine. First, it took 15 minutes for someone to bring us menus. A server walked past several times without even looking at us. When we finally got our menu, I ordered wine quickly (the only good part of the meal, because it was half-off) and my boyfriend wanted a minute to look at the beer selection.  He asks for a minute, she's back ten minutes later with my wine. He orders a Belgian from their craft brew section, only for our waitress to tell us that BJs is discontinuing their craft selection and they didn't have what he wanted. In fact, she showed us a picture of the beer fridge to show what they had left, which is just sloppy. Why would you put a menu down in front of a customer that is so inaccurate and then get huffy when they need time to pick something else? After delivering that bad news, our waitress just stood there and didn't even try to suggest him anything else, so he said he'd need another minute but we at least got to order our food. Here's where it gets weird. It took her FOREVER to come back and take his drink order again. Like, he tried subtle eye contact, small hand gestures, and she just seemed determined to blow right past us. (And we both used to wait tables, so we're not unrealistic like some other customers.) He finally resorted to shouting at her back, which she still didn't notice. He got to order a beer at 9:30 (I was already done with my wine), and it came with our food, which brings me to my next point.  We'd ordered a pizza and a salad with the dressing on the side. It showed up around 9:45. The dressing was not on the side, and when the waitress asked if I wanted her to take it back, I straight-up told her that I wasn't willing to let that salad leave my sight because I was sure I'd never see it again.  So now she knows we're pissed, and decided to try and make up for it by checking in on us every minute after that which was just so annoying at that point. We seriously considered just asking for boxes when the pizza came so we could just eat at home, but we were hungry. My boyfriend complained, but the manager guy didn't say anything, just that he was sorry we didn't enjoy ourselves, then he turned around and left.  So the boyfriend and I will be patronizing Flames downtown from now on. I'd rather eat less good food in a louder, less adult atmosphere because at least I always leave there in a better mood than I arrived in. This experience was just bad, and the worst part was that if the service had taken longer, we at least could have gotten happy hour prices on our food. As it was, it was a 50 dollar tab for a lot of nothing and I'm not giving them any more of my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=180

Emily P.,"San Jose, CA",264,348,175,5.0,6/12/2014,"This BJs is located at Oakridge Mall and is always a long wait because of the amount of people that come here. I'm still giving this place 5 stars because it's not their fault that this place is so good and everyone wants to come here! Yesterday I celebrated my son's 11th birthday there and had a party of 15. Because I'm so smart, I called right when they opened yesterday to make a reservation for 6:30pm. I was told reservations need manager's approval which was easy for them to get. I'm not sure if a manager's approval is always needed or it was just needed this week because of all the graduation dinners going on. For people that were just walking in the wait was one and half hours to two hours (which is the usual wait for this place but I think it was a little bit longer because of all the grad dinners going on). I got there 6:20pm and my table was ready on the dot by 6:30pm! Which is nice about this place when you have a reservation is that your whole party does not need to be there to be seated. We had a nice long table out on the patio setup. We had great and fast service the whole night. A huge plus was that all our food for dinner came out at once and all of the orders were correct (this is always a huge challenge when having a big party).  For dessert, everyone got pizookies! But before bringing everyone's pizookie out, they brought the birthday boy's out with a candle for us to sing happy birthday :) I would definitely come here again for when I have a big dinner party!

What I HATE about this place is the service can be horrible at times. It can be totally dead, and it can take 10-15 minutes to get our first drink order. 40 minutes from food order to table. Wrong items, etc. The people are always nice, but their process and execution is mostly miss. Consistently. And it is one of those frustrating places where you see 5 workers standing around bs'ing. Granted, they are probably busers or hostesses, but text book example of a poorly managed restaurant.  Some of the food is actually pretty decent. Kids love the mac-n-cheese, the pizza, the ribs, the pazooki. I like the ahi tuna salad and their pizzas are pretty good.

When I called over the phone, the worker told me that I was put on the list, however when I went to check in, he told me it was another 40 minutes.  Their texting system is pretty helpful and accurate. 40 minutes later, we were seated. We started off with calamari and when it arrived, it was such a let down!!!!! It was drowned in oil and abnormally soft, and chewy. We also ordered the traditional wings, because our waitress, Brittney, recommended it as her favorite. Their traditional wings came with celery and with both ranch and/or mild or super spicy sauce. You can pick either one. The mild sauce had an abnormally strong smell, but it tasted great!!! For the main meal, I ordered the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger with a side of seasoned potato wedges (you can pick between this or crispy fries) and my girlfriend ordered the deep dish ziti. Honestly, the side of seasoned potato wedges didn't taste ""seasoned"". There was really no difference between the potato wedges and crispy fries. Overall, I really enjoyed my burger - mainly the BBQ sauce!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU DONT MIND 1200 CALORIES. When I tried the deep dish ziti, it tasted like a pizza in pasta form. It's actually new to the menu, and well worth the price, if you're looking for something really cheesy. After the group finished all our meals, we ordered the monkey bread pizookie and salted caramel pizookie - the waitress put both of them on the house because it was my friend's birthday. The pizookies are definitely why people come here. After our meal, the waitress brought us our meal, and though they didn't incorporate tip into the price, their receipt does show the calculated 10% and 15% tip wages. No pressure, I guess.

All items were a disappointment. The driver took the initiative to call and let me know he was still waiting almost an hour after I placed the order, so when the food arrived it was lukewarm  (not the driver's fault).

I ordered one of their beers (Temple of Stone IPA), which is a must, and was not disappointed. I can see coming here just for the beer. Anyway, my main course was the House Top Sirloin, which was the perfect size, and I appreciated the nice selection of sides from which to choose (I opted for the wedge salad and roasted brussels sprouts). We'll be back, and intend to come here for dinner more often. Great selection, great food, and reasonable prices. Oh, and I paid with the Android app, which gave us a 20% discount (offer valid through 2015-08-31).

Maricella G.,"San Jose, CA",11,11,5,1.0,5/18/2015,"Usually when I come here I get pretty good service....well depending what time it is and what servers are there. The last time I went in my girlfriend stood in front waiting for someone to come ask us how many to be seated for about 10min (we were the only ones standing there) finally a guy who was standing on the other side starring at the booths closest to the bar comes over and sits us and lets us know out waiter will be over soon. So we sit down and behind us is a group of 3 which we noticed the waiter (who ends up being ours) is walking back and forth to their table conversating with them and what not. He finally decides to come over to our table and take our order... now with my girlfriends plate she asked for mashed potatoes instead of rice and asparagus instead of broccoli. I had a feeling he wasnt even listening because he was so concerned with the table behind us.  Sure enough when our food came out there was broccoli instead of asparagus. Not to mention we're sitting there for about 15min with no silverware. We then noticed that  of the guys who clean thr table's was actually friends with the table behind us. Just to clear up our waiter and other guy, the other guy was philipino or asian im not sure and our waiter was a very tall whitr guy who knees down when taking our order. Both young. So the asian guy takes New silverware to the table behind us and starts talking to them and my girlfriend hears them tell him ""no we dont need silverware "" so our waiter 15min later realizes we dont have anything to eat our food with and go gets silverware. We then tell him we didn't want broccoli but asparagus. So he goes to the back puts in the order then comes back when we're half way done with our meal. (But not to mention he was back and forth ""checking"" on his co-workers, friends table just ignoring ours)  We finish eating and again like the whole night we hear him behind us talking to his co-workers friends and telling them ""I'll get you one of each of the pizokis (i believe their called) and comp it.... it's all of ur bdays today""  He comes to our table ohhh some time later takes our dessert order then leaves. He later passes by our booth and takes the table their dessert. They then leave and are all by the walk way to the bar saying by hugging etc.  He then comes to our table like 10min later and says ""we're remaking ur pizoki because the cook burned it"" we finally get it finish get our check and notice that he charged us for the asparagus  even though it was his mistake and we didn't eat the broccoli. We were so irritated and mad that we didnt even feel like arguing over some damn asparagus. So how nice we get terrible customer service, amd charged extra for something that was suppose to substitute something else. But bravo to him for looking out for his friends behind us and giving them all free dessert because he's ganna pretend its all their birthday. Where was the floor manager when all of this was happening... no where to be found! I work in a concierge office and my girlfriend is a manager for customer service so yeah from this point of view management lets their waiters do what ever they want and treat their friends great and their customers like crap!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=200

I got the soup and salad combo unlimited and then the waiter completely ignored us (probably because  she thought we were just teenagers and she thought we weren't going to tip her well ). Every time we wanted to place another soup or salad it was another 30 minute ordeal. we spilt our soda and a half our later she comes and she kicked the ice under the table and told us to not tell her manager.

Our appetizer was ordered significantly before our entree and only came out a few minutes before and nothing was hot, just warm. You know it's bad when a mozzarella stick is basically just a breaded piece of string cheese that doesn't move when you bite into it. Also, after ordering eggs, she came back and said they don't do poached. I found this weird that an establishment that makes eggs can't do a basic style. It was almost as if the high chefs just didn't know how to make that style and I pictured everyone in the back trying to look it up on google.

The deep dish pizza are delicious here (the great white, which is alfredo) and their calzones.  Overall their food is delicious. However, I was not a fan of their Summer Splash drink.

The wait wasn't that long considering that it was on a weekday. I came here with 3 of my friends, a total of 4. The wait was about 15 minutes. We were seated promptly to our seats and greeted friendly by a waiter. He was nice, but seemed very shy. You could tell by his tone and loudness of his voice. It wasn't too pleasant. We ordered right away since we were super hungry. I ordered the California Burger.  The wait for the food took quite long. We all ordered burgers, so it shouldn't take that long. But it did. It took about a good 35 minutes for the food to even come!  After our food came, our waiter apologized to us that his shift was off and he has someone else which was a lady. We were NOT greeted by her nor were we TREATED well. I felt as if since my group was young age, 18, she didn't want to waste her time. I felt very offended by that. I mean I'm a waitress too, I totally understand, but she has to be more mature and literally act more professional! Plus, our first waiter who supposedly said his shift was off BUT stayed there to hang out? I don't understand. If your shift is off shouldn't you leave? Not sit there, walk around, or hang out?  Also, for the check. It was super confusing and terrible! I had to personally come up to a different waiter to ask for change and LITERALLY they said they couldn't do it. They needed to find my waitress. Wait, did I forget to mention that whenever I held my hand up for service, NO ONE CAME?! They all just stared and pretended as if they didn't know anything. How annoying. We had to wait another 20 minutes until she came back! Super ridiculous. No kidding why this place has a 3 star. I wonder why!

Please take a few minutes to read about our experience.  We were greeted warmly upon arrival and told that there would be a 20 minute wait for a table for 2. Which is fine, we were willing to wait. A few seconds later, one of their employees stated that they had a table for 2 available, and we were escorted to the table. That was the only pleasant thing that happened during our meal.  Nobody ever came to our table. Not to say hello, not to say ""I'll be right with you"", NOBODY!!! After 15 minutes of being ignored, I flagged down a waiter who was walking by and asked for water and let him know we were ready to order. He stated that we weren't his area, but he would still take care of us. And he did. He took our orders and brought us water. During the meal, he stated that he was going to take his dinner break and introduced us to a new server. The original waiter stated that they'd take care of dessert for us for the long wait. Something we didn't ask for but accepted as a sign of good faith. Once we were done with dinner, we asked the replacement waiter for dessert. He said, ""Its on its way out. It should be out shortly."" More than 30 minutes went by and nothing came out. He nervously came back to our table to apologize for the wait and he would personally go see what was taking so long. They had forgot about our dessert. He came back to apologize again and at that point we just wanted to pay and leave. The mall was closing and we had to finish Christmas shopping. He took more than 15 minutes to bring out the dessert and our check. He knew that we had waited almost an hour for dessert and stated that his manager was going to come by and discuss our terrible experience.  THE MANAGER NEVER CAME TO OUR TABLE!!! That was the ultimate slap in the face. I wanted to speak with the manager to explain how awful our experience was. But since he never came, I couldn't. We also couldn't finish Christmas shopping because of how long we waited for a Pazooki and the manager. Needless to say, we left the restaurant very upset, did not tip a dime and wrote a note to the irresponsible manager on the receipt.  I will never return to BJs at Oakridge Mall. I will also suggest to friends and family to never go their either. Their lack of urgency and respect is something I will NEVER forget.  Worst service we've ever had.

Ray W.,"San Jose, CA",128,54,56,2.0,5/18/2014,"This is just your typical BJ's. Nothing special and nothing out of the ordinary. If you go to BJ's you have to get the appetizers. I feel like the entrees are really hit or miss but the appetizers never seem to disappoint. The potato skins are a personal favorite of mine. Unlike most places, the potato skins are cooked to perfection. The outside is extra crispy even though the skins are cut thicker than most other places. It's also topped with bacon, green onions and sour cream. The Avocado Eggrolls are not a bad choice either. However, the sweet sauce that comes with it is a bit too sweet. Both these appetizers are super filling so I would recommend getting a smaller entree. Their deep dish pizzas are a personal favorite of mine, especially the Chicken and Bacon one. It's loaded with chicken and bacon (of course) along with green onions, tomatoes and a white creamy sauce. It is delicious with some red peppers sprinkled on top. I decided to try the traditional deep dish with sausages, bell pepper, tomatoes and onions. I must say, I was pretty disappointed. Some slices had no flavor and some slices were extremely salty. Not entirely sure what was going on with that. The one thing that really irked me was how slow the service was. My girlfriend and I spent two hours there but only 20 minutes of that were spent eating. The rest of the time was spent waiting for our waitress to take our order and bring our food. We waited a good 20 minutes before we could flag her down to bring us our check and another 15 minutes for them to charge my card. The service was terrible and the food was awful. I would only recommend going here if you can't decide what to eat and happen to be in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=240
Vivian A.,"Arvada, CO",859,881,1836,3.0,11/22/2011,"This BJ's is attached to Oakridge Mall. We were shopping at the mall when we decided we were getting hungry and we called in to put our name in the queue. The guy on the phone told us there wasn't a line but we figured we'd put our name in since we still had to hit up one more store. By the time we got there about 20 minutes later, there was a 30 minute wait but since we had called ahead of time, it was only a lil' under 10 for us to get our table ready.  Sweet. Ordered a Frosty Peach to calm my shoppers nerves and this thing was refreshing but GANGLY SWEET! I love sweets but this was like dumped on sugar.  It seemed like a light pour and heavy on the sugar but 10 minutes later I was feeling a bit happy, so there was definitely some alcohol masked under all that sugar. What we swallowed: FRIED ARTICHOKE HEARTS: I love artichokes. I love anything battered and fried. These tasted like those bottled marinated artichoke hearts you put on your salad, battered and deep fried. I'm glad I tried them but they didn't ""WOW"" me enough to order them again. FRIED CALAMARI: Good portion with nice dipping sauces. It wasn't chewy, so that's a big plus. CHICKEN WON TONS: These were more like a cheesy-chicken wonton. Still a good flavor whatever was in the middle but good thing there were only three in a serving 'cuz these weren't that great either. SPINACH and ARTICHOKE with add-on ITALIAN SAUSAGE DEEP DISH PIZZA: This was scrumptious. I'm glad I ordered the Italian Sausage as it cut up the spinach and artichoke. The bread is spot on: nice and doughy with crispy edges. I only had a small piece as the three appetizer dishes were more than enough food. The pizza was even better the next day (just make sure you toast it so you get that toasted edge bread action). HALF PEANUT BUTTER/HALF CHOCOLATE CHUNK PAZOOKI: You can't come to BJ's without having a pazooki! Even completely full from the appetizers this was happily inhaled. Hot, moist, the slighty salty peanut butter cookie offset the chocolate chunks, topped with oozing cold vanilla ice cream all in one bite gooified in your mouth. You can't go wrong here. The Canadian ordered the POT ROAST open face sandwich. The portion was a bit on the small size (glad we got appetizers) and he said it was lukewarm. It was actually an open faced sandwich with a big hunkin' mashed potato scoop in the middle with chunks of pot roast on each side. He said the flavor was good though, too bad it wasn't served hotter. The server was nice but a bit forgetful. He would take our order and three steps later, completely forget what we just said.  Three stars for the Frosty Peach, Fried Artichoke Hearts, Chicken Won Tons, and the lukewarm Pot Roast Sandwich (4 items). Four stars for the Pizza, Fried Calamari, and Pazooki (3). Three and a half stars on the round down so three stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=240

I hadn't had BJ's in a while and i remember that i used to LOVE the great white pizza but for some reason it was super bland this time around :(  Luckily, they have the best avocado eggrolls ever.  I have tried avocado egg rolls at many places but no other place has that delicious sweet sauce that compliments the eggrolls so well.  I feel so bad for all the people allergic to avocados because I would keep coming back to BJ's JUST for the avocado egg rolls. My co-worker knows my obsession with patty melts so she recommended a sandwich there that is pretty much a patty melt (just with a different name).  Look in the sandwich section for sourdough bread and like a burger meat/onions.  This sandwich definitely will NOT disappoint.  Want to make it even better?  Get a side of thousand island to go with it.  You can thank me later! To end my meal, I got what people actually come to BJ's for...their PIZOOKIES!!!  get a half and half pizookie so you can have some V-A-R-I-E-T-Y :) ENJOY!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=240

Angelica C.,"San Jose, CA",68,8,39,3.0,9/28/2013,"First, lets begin with location. Restaurant is at a mall which makes this place a good choice for dinner after a long day of shopping. There are other exceptional restaurants lined up as well next to BJ's.  Second, BJ's allows call ahead seating so I suggest to call because the wait is quite long on weekends.  Third, the waiters and hosts are all very friendly and charismatic. They made dining a pleasure.  Now, lets move on to the food. The calamari is perfect! I always get it. The Clam Chowder soup (with no bacon) is delicious. I wish I had more. It's creamy and the chunky contents such as the potatoes and clams are cut in small pieces and aren't too big to eat. You'll be taking big spoonfuls for every bite once you get it.  Presentation isn't impressive but the taste of each dish is satisfying. I ordered the Alaskan Salmon. The plate is a light dish with perfectly sized Salmon covered in a light white sauce, a tasty rice with herbs, and vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and cucumbers.  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp gumbo. This plate doesn't look big when it's first presented, but it's actually quite a lot. It's a heavy dish so if you have a small stomach, you'll get full quick.  And obviously, the pizookie. This amazing little circle of a cookie has different flavors like Chocolate Chip, Cookies and Cream, and Red Velvet. If you're an Oreo lover, you'll love Cookies and Cream. In addition to the Oreo cookie and vanilla ice cream, it's topped with a whipped cream that appears to be mixed with very little crumbs of Oreo that compliments the pizookie nicely. If you're in a table with 3-4, I suggest to get the pizookie trio platter and just share. With an appetizer, main dish, and drink, you may already be full before the dessert comes out. But even if you are full, it's a MUST to eat a pizookie at BJ's so make sure you save room for dessert!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=240

The chicken nachos were very good.  I loved how crispy the tri-colored chips were and the amount of toppings that were on it.  The cheese was warm and not very melted, but overall the nachos were good. I ordered the soup and salad entree with the tomato soup and the caesar salad.  The tomato soup and the caesar salad were generic and they were not bad.  It was a good lunch portion, filling, but not heavy. I shared a half original chocolate chip, half white chocolate chip macadamia pizookie with my friends.  The cookie was nice and crunchy on the edge, but nice and chewy in the center.  They put just the right amount of ice cream on top as well.   Since we had a large party, the service took forever just to order and then wait for the food.  Our reservation started at 1:30 and we did not leave till 4:30.  Because our party was big, they sat us outside.  When the plastic shades were down, it felt muggy and when they opened the plastic shades, the sun was on our backs.  There were some umbrellas but they were in fixed places and they could not be moved to cover everyone.  It was difficult to get a hold of our waiter at times and we had to be conservative drinking our water because we weren't sure when we would get a chance to flag him down.

You could tell it was at a relaxed point in the evening, and instead of feeling left alone while some servers would be off chatting with co-workers, Biagio was attentive at all the right points of our meal. I think the only thing he didn't check back to make sure I was enjoying was the dinner salad I had ordered. Ironically it seemed that the salad was the only item with an issue - it had been garnished with cilantro instead of parsley (not typically a problem, but I can't stand the taste of cilantro). Not really an issue, but a noticeable error for me.

Cristal H.,"San Jose, CA",116,80,7,3.0,2/6/2015,"Normally I enjoy this place very much and have had great experiences, but last night was not one of them.  1 Star - For being open later than most restaurants. 1 Star - For their menu and expanded beer selections. 1 Star - For cleanliness and general politeness of its employees.  Last night - I wanted nothing more than to leave. It was just two of us, the host had us seated immediately and advised us that our server would be by shortly. Okay, standard. 5 minutes, nothing. 10 minutes, nothing. A friendly server named Tasha walked by and asked if we'd have drink orders taken, and said she'd happily take them and send our server over. She returned a few minutes later with our drinks and asked if he came by, Nope. She was nice enough to take our orders. Since we sat down I had noticed a server being awfully chatty with two girls sitting in a corner booth, assuming he was off I didn't think anything of it at first. Until about 10 minutes after our food came out, and this guy came over and asked how our food was. Who the hell are you? Oh, dude in the corner IS our server. Nice.  Tasha kept coming over and checking on us and she was wonderful. Once we finished our meal, we sat patiently for someone to ask us if we wanted dessert or the check. 5 minutes..10...seriously? Again? And who was standing in the corner with the two girls at the booth, oh of course, our server. So we flagged down Tasha and politely asked for our bill, and also confirmed if the gentleman in the corner was our server, he was. We asked if she could be our server and have the check put in her name so the tip would go to her. Justyn D (our ""server"") - we were there for an hour, you came over for 2 seconds and we didn't know who the hell you were because you spent almost the entire time talking to the two girls in the corner booth. If you didn't want to work, you should have asked the host not to seat anyone in your section. It's not unreasonable for patrons to come to your establishment and expect to be acknowledged.

MY ORDER (HAPPY HOUR) - Mini bruschetta: These were a bit dry-- I felt like I was a parrot eating crackers!  Still decent as an appetizer though.  Even though they look pretty small, one bite is a mouthful ( ). - Spinach-stuffed mushrooms:  I loved this.  You could tell each mushroom was full of flavor.  So juicy!  I'm such a sucker for these things.  They were gone within minutes ( ). - Birthday pizookie: Best thing at BJ's.  Seriously, if you've been here and haven't tried their pizookie, what were you doing?!  A wad of ice cream on top of a warm cookie.  Irresistible goodness.  Good thing I don't eat here often cause I would end up with a pizookie top ( ). I didn't have to wait to be seated, but the wait for the food took forever, even though it was 3 pm on a Wednesday and half the place was empty.  And when you're by yourself, the time passes by twenty times slower than it actually does.  Everything was half off during happy hour, so the bill came out to around $9 including tax and tip.  Sweeeet.  Definitely worth coming here for happy hour!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=280

Me & my boyfriend went to have dinner here tonight & I can honestly say we had the worst service in the history of customer service. When your waiter is rude & purposely ignoring you even the food and drink start to taste bad. The whole time we were there we just wanted to leave but we were hungry & it was too late to go elsewhere. The server was the most meanest and rudest person I've ever encountered. He was arrogant and completely hated us because it was happy hour and we took up a big table as the lady at check in said we could sit anywhere in the happy hour section and we picked the round table that sits a group, we overheard him and the his server friend saying ""why would they take that table"", so unprofessional. Whenever we would order something he would just give us this horrid stare like he was mad at us not say anything and then walk away he would go check on other tables and skip ours and didn't even offer us water. It was such an awkward atmosphere because he was clearly talking about us to his other shift buddies and they'd all stare at us like it was high school and they were the bullies, he just didn't like us and I can't believe we stayed there and paid $80 for rubbish service. I loved BJs never will I go there again or advise anyone to go there especially this location. Worst experience everrrrrrr! Also the food was so bad, the avocado spring rolls looked like a mess on the plate and the mini pizzas were cold and the ingredients looked old and also tasted old and sour. My boyfriend took one bite and left his pizza. I'm sure the server told the chefs to purposely make our food bad.

I called to make a reservation for 10 people for my sisters birthday on march 9th I called about a week and a half out the first time the girl took all my info down and then at the end said they were super busy so they would call me back never did nor did she say only a manager could take my reservation. The next day I called again having not received a call back I was put on hold for 30 minutes so I just hung up called back 15 mins later finally got someone who knew what she was doing told me only managers can make reservations put me on hold and got a manager to help me. I spoke with the GM she was nice gave her my info and told her my frustrations she was really nice and apologized for the inconvenience. I arrived on 3/9 to find out they gave us a table outside had no other option because their booths only fit 7 hmm something they should have told me. Our waitress was amazing she deserves praise and a raise food was sub par but she really made up for my experience well so I thought. Yesterday 3/19 I receive a call from Bjs wanting to know if I am coming in for my reservation they had me down for I said no I already came 10 days ago I'm not sure why you have me down for today the girl apologized and hung up then about an hour later another one calls saying I have a reservation first of all do you guys not communicate because I've already spoken to someone second of all I already went to your establishment 10 days ago but it makes sense why they had me multiple times because these people do not have their stuff together. You would think they would want a party of 10 but I guess not I am so disappointed about the way I was treated. No sincere apology or anything as a manager myself in the hotel industry I strive on customer service and communication which this place is lacking.

To which they said oh let's check on that and it came back out less than 5 minutes later... So... Now her chicken is getting cold while she try's to enjoy some of the appetizers. To top it all off while we were eating I ordered a pazooki to go and a half hour later after paying for our food and terrible service, after being told twice it was almost ready. and then waiting another 15 minutes and asking another server to check on it for me we finally got it and left..

Steve K.,"San Jose, CA",95,23,,2.0,11/12/2014,"Very interesting experience at BJ's last night.  We got there after battling the Oakridge parking lot and got seated right away, around 6pm.  It was more crowded than usual on a Tuesday night because of Veterans day and many people and kids had off.   We ordered potato skins first and they came out in a timely manner.  Besides bacon being on only 2 of the 10 skins and one being turned upside down and mushy (attention to details Mr BJ Chef), they were good.  We got some more bacon to add, which helped.  Lo and behold, less than 2 minutes after receiving our skins, out come the main entrees!  To me, this is unacceptable!  They are called appetizers for a reason and they should be enjoyed, not rushed down my gullet!  They took back the entree's and most likely put them under the heat lamp while we finished our apps (about 10 minutes).  The waitress (who did a great job) apologized and said that they didn't expect such a big crowd and cooks were just trying to get things ""out"".  Well, that is no excuse in my book. The Manager comes over and apologizes as well and I just conveyed my feelings on how it would be nice to actually take my time on my appetizer before main course showed up.   We got our main courses and were happy with the food.  We had the pulled pork sandwich and the prawns over pasta.  Huge portions which neither of us could finish but all tasted fine.   The waitress comes over and hands us a gift card and vip 20% off card and apologized for the way the food came out.  We thanked her and continued to try to make a dent into our entree's.  About 15 minutes later, the manager comes back, reaches down on the table and grabs the Gift card and discount card that were in an envelope thing and tell us that ""this was not meant to be given to you, it was for another table"" and walks away.  Really really strange!  We told the waitress, she was mystified as well and told us she would get the manager back over, but at that point, i had had enough and told her not to worry about it.  We went on our way with dumbfounded looks on our face.   I can say, i will be back but will not make it a priority to go to BJ's with all the other options in the mall.  This Manager needs to learn how to deal with people a lot more professionally in my opinion.   The food remains consistent at BJ's, the management not so much!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=380

Was told the wait would be about 45 minutes. They do not take reservations for less than 10 people. Kids love this place so we decided to wait. After about an hour we asked what the position was the guy at the table said we were a party of 7 (4 adults, one high chair and 2 less than 5 years old) and needed a larger booth. He then told us that there was a booth being cleared in the pub section and we can get that table as it was first come first serve. I ran over to reserve the spot but as I approached someone else got there before me. You would think that if there were first come first serve seating in a section, we might have been able to secure a seat an hour and a half earlier???? We then requested to speak to some up the chain... this is where it gets interesting... the lady told us we could sit outside.. or wait till more till the 2 tables were free(mind you all this while adjacent tables were emptying and people after us were being serviced because they were smaller parties). It was hot outside and the kids were beginning to get cranky especially the little one. We still wanted to talk to the manager and then someone miraculously showed up. She began attempting to explain our situation to him with her spin on it. I explained to the manager our situation, where he asked front desk guy what we were told the wait was. He told him we were told 45 minutes(doubt that guy will be there for long), then he asked if it was 45 minutes since we were here?????? Then I knew what I was dealing with... it continues....  He asked how long we were there, to which I replied for almost an hour and a half where she interjected saying I had said an hour before and now I was telling the manager it was an hour and a half. Since were at the front, I asked the front desk guy to tell us how long our wait was and still going on(I still had our buzzer with me)... needless to say she was wrong and proved wrong by her own staff. She was miffed big time!! Regardless, it was becoming a scene and we were surrounded by wait staff and one of the dudes became aggressive(Z was his name?) and told us to just leave while my other friend was still talking to the manager. I ignored him as I knew he was there because of customers like us. Without trying to help us in any way the manager told us he refused to serve us and asked us to leave. So we did.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=380

Kaveeta A.,"San Jose, CA",81,27,21,1.0,11/1/2015,"Service is terrible here. Went in for lunch today and was told wait time for two will be 15-20 mins, got seated after 30 mins despite the fact that there were about 6 tables empty. I don't know if they were short staffed or just slow. Finally, was able to get the table for two, we already knew what we wanted, so when the waitress came to take the order we were ready. Repeated my order twice and she repeated back just to verify no bacon on my pizza. Waited about ten minutes for water and she didn't even bring out the appetizer. Waited about 35 minutes for food and guess what when the food finally arrived it was wrong. No chicken on the pizza but with bacon and ham. And I am still waiting for the appetizer. When I told the waitress that the order is wrong she looked very confused and finally offered to place another order. We were starving so we told her it's okay. She went ahead and told her manager who showed up and seemed more confused than anything else. I don't know how she manages the place. I repeated my order to her and the waitress repeated the order as well but the manager kept saying she doesn't get it. Showed her ham and bacon on the pizza but she believed that I made a mistake while ordering, so she went to grab the menu to prove me wrong but I was right. Anyways finally she said she will replace the order and by that time I told her I'll eat the pizza and remove the bacon and ham. Mind you my chicken pizza didn't have no chicken. After all that happened, the waitress didn't come and check on us once. She brought the bill at least with no sorry or thank you.

The thing that I hate about BJ's is that they ALWAYS have terrible service... you sit forever before someone even comes to the table, food takes forever and the servers just aren't attentive at all. Being a server myself, I can't even believe it sometimes, but that's beside the point.. So, I go in yesterday (monday evening) and a friend and I sat in the cocktail area, I believe my servers name was Danny but I'm not completely sure.. So let me tell you, he was the best server that I have EVER had there, he was friendly, attentive, patient and made sure that everything was all good! He was definitely on top of his shit!

Lucy D.,"Milpitas, CA",486,786,1873,4.0,5/24/2011,"BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse combines new American cuisines with several other different cultures. They are known for there beers and there appetizers are simple delicious. If its your birthday they give you a free piziooke.  Pros Service: The service here is wonderful and attentive.  Food: They have a huge variety of food. There appetizers are simple delicious and there pizza is crispy and fresh. They have a large spaghetti menu and most of them are simple delicious. Like its name sake they are known for there specialty beer. AND the drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) goes well with all the food you get.  Location: This place is conveniently located in a shopping mall where you can shop and maybe catch a movie afterwards.   Atmosphere: The atmosphere is lively and the decorations is similar to a sports bar.  Cons Crowded: This place can get packed on the weekdays and the weekends during dinner so make a reservation or come early, but expect to wait long wait times if you don't have a reservation.  Parking: Can be a pain when it gets packed because its next to other restaurants and the shopping center so expect to park far if you come during the night time.  Overall this place is a great place to bring a group to come and enjoy the ambiance.

Anthony P.,"San Jose, CA",73,187,339,1.0,5/18/2013,"-5 stars I didn't even eat here because the hosts pissed me off before my gf and I could even sit down. We were shopping at Oakridge and were starving. I wanted something that wasn't going to fill me up too much and was going to order off their enlightened menu.  It was a warm day and we wanted to eat in the outdoor patio. The guy at the host stand said ""uuuuummmmm (while looking at the schedule) we don't have anyone covering that area for another 45 mintues."" We decided to eat in the dining room. The girl host brought us over to a booth that was uncomfortably close to another party. When we asked if we could have the booth right next to it she said ""ummm no I'm sorry."" WHAT!? NO I'M SORRY I EVEN TRIED EATING HERE! It was literally one booth difference. WHATS THE BIG FUCKING DEAL! We walked out and BJ's lost money because they don't know anything about customer service. It was a slow Wednesday afternoon and they couldn't even accommodate the simplest of requests.   Note to Management: What ever the customer wants the customer gets! ""No"" should not be in your vocabulary. I'm a paying customer and if I want to dine outside, you are supposed to find a way to make it happen, especially when your restaurant is near empty!

Angel K.,"San Jose, CA",176,292,2781,2.0,8/21/2013,"Came here a couple of times when we had big group dinners. The wait is always horrendous if you want to eat at a normal time. Even when we came early around 4:30 PM we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before we could get seated. The service here is okay. It's usually pretty slow, but our server always stopped by every time we tried to wave her down.  For some reason, all of the silverware and utensils we had were filthy. We had utensils that still had food stuck to them, cups that had stains in them (one's that you could scrap off with a fingernail) and plates that had things stuck to them too. Didn't make me feel too good when I saw how dirty everything was. Made me wonder how the dishes that the food was served on looked before they got to the table.  Food wasn't anything too special. The highlight of the meal was probably the avocado egg rolls but I could just be biased because I love avocados and a sweet sauce. We also got a deep dish pizza and southern fried chicken. Pizza wasn't anything too special and chicken was just okay. Nothing that really wowed us.  Pazookies used to be one of my favorite desserts, but there was something off about the pazookie. Something didn't taste right and I wasn't sure if it was because of my taste buds. It was something in the cookie that tasted off, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was. White chocolate macadamia nut is my absolute favorite pazookie, I'll probably give it another try the next time we have a huge group dinner outing to see if it's any different. Maybe it was just that batch? TL;DR: might have to wait to be seated, good for big groups and beer, food isn't anything spectacular and you have to shell out quite a bit for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=260

Our server asked another server that was on lunch and asked about the happy hour.  That server said happy hour was only served at the bar.  That's such bs because I've been seated in the patio before before 7pm and we got the happy hour there. The food took a long time and the people bringing out the food didn't know which food belong to which table. Not very organized. This was a work party and we wanted to do spilt bills but the server said she asked us about that.  That's another lie. My coworker got the wrong entrée and he took a bite out of it before the server ran out to grab the plate back because it was the wrong one. Apparently they gave his dish to another table. He had to wait for his food that they ended up comping for free. That doesn't make up for the mistake. We started to wonder what they did with that last dish that took back that had been bitten into. What still really bugs me is how happy hour is only served at the bar.

Melanie N.,"San Jose, CA",136,16,1,1.0,4/28/2016,"I wish I could give this restaurant less than one star. I met some friends to celebrate a birthday. (BJs wasn't my choice) Our first server disappeared for a long period of time (we were waiting for a 4th friend to show up and didn't want to order without her). Thankfully we got a new server, Miguel who was the ONLY thing positive about the visit.  1) Our beers were warm so we sent them back. My friend ordered a margarita without salt to replace the beer she sent back and it came with salt. 2) We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer and ended up with a stale, mangled platter of ""bottom of the bag"" chip pieces. My friend asked the expo for ranch and he never returned with any. 3) My friends side salad was ordered and requested to be served before our entrees. It came out after our entrees. 4) Two of us ordered Mediterranean Pita Tacos without onions and they came with onions. We sent them back and the new batch still had pieces of onions. We saw a server (Patrick) and asked if he could take them back to the kitchen and he looked at us like we asked him to do something completely insane/ridiculous. I thought maybe it was his first day on the job but it turns out he's worked there for a long time and it wasn't ""his problem"" to deal with. The manager on duty didn't seem too apologetic when we requested him to our table. He was quick to offer a discount and didn't ever come back to check in on the end of our experience. Clearly, if we had this many mistakes with our table, there must be other parties with problems too. It seems like no one was willing to take accountability. It's safe to say I will never return. Not even for happy hour.  I feel for Miguel, who clearly holds himself to a high standard of customer service. The kitchen, management and other servers do not support the experience he tried very hard to provide us with.

Our server seemed confused when I asked if the salads were coming. I guess she thought everyone had gotten their food. I had ordered the Enlightened mango chicken salad. It is a new item on the menu, and I was kind of disappointed that the mangoes were not even ripe. They were really hard. The sauce to the salad was really sweet and it was topped with some sort of pepper powder. Possibly paprika.  My boyfriend had a split cheeseburger and Mediterranean pizza. The Mediterranean pizza was super cheesy. It had like feta and the regular cheese. As for the cheeseburger one, he liked it a lot, but I didn't try it because I don't eat bacon.

First, the beer is good. Actually since I've last gone, the beer has gotten slightly better because they have more options. My problem was the food. Everything we got was almost inedible. How do you screw up mac and cheese? It had no cheese in it. It was mac and grease. A small pile of mac and grease. That's enticing! The stuffed mushrooms were runny and flavorless. The asian mango salad was just bad. The mangos were raw, the dressing didn't go with any of the flavors, and the salad was wilting.

If you want more sauce it comes with a side of extra sauce for dipping. The fries are hit and miss as sometimes they are perfectly hot and crispy and other times they are cold and soggy.  My other go to thing to order is the mahi mahi or shrimp tacos. It comes with two tacos for lunch and you can get the fish grilled or fried. You can get one of each or one fish one shrimp.

Now, I'm sure you've all been to a BJ's just as you've all been to a Chili's (or three other huge chain burger joints I can't think of right now), and you know that it's a slight cut above that genre of restaurants. The appetizers are more impressive than their entrees and, for a chain that serves chips and salsa, I really do like their chips and salsa the best. I'd say an average BJ's is 4-star worthy and that's taking into account menu diversity, quality of their food, atmosphere and overall satisfaction. However, this location is one of my least favorites due to their wait staff. The staff is always miserable (besides Justine). From simply their attentiveness for each table to their overall (un)cheerfulness, it's really bothersome to feel so.. Well... Bothersome to a waiter/waitress when you'd just like to enjoy a meal out. There are long times in between ""oh were just looking at the menu, big menu, haha"" to ""ok, I think we'd like to order an appetizer and a few drinks"" to ""ok were ready to order."" By the time you're ready for that final stage, your body has literally digested your appetizer and you're only ordering again because your nutritionist told you that eating every 3 hours is good for your metabolism.

But what you would probably expect from a brewhouse/restaurant is a good place to come a catch a game. This is only half true, the bar area is decent, there is plenty of televisions and projectors to catch the games and latest sports news, but the bar area is kinda small here, and if you're sitting in the booths or tables outside of the bar you wont get much of a view of the games which is a negative for me.  The good points:  1.) Good choice of brews, both house and imports/domestics.  2.) Variety of food with good options, and their menu is quite tasty.  3.) Happy hour is good, it's only available if you're sitting in the bar area, so just a heads up.  4.) Plates are fairly priced, and the portions are big. The bad points: 1.) This location is located in the mall, as well as in the front where there is a lot of other restaurants, as well as a movie theater, so parking can be a (bleep) sometimes. 2.) Televisions away from the bar are small and spread far apart so it isn't great for watching games.  Happy hour is Monday-Friday from 3pm-7pm, Sunday-Thursday from 10pm-close. $1.00 Off Draft Beers, $1.00 Off Cocktails, Half Off Mini Pizza & $2.00 Off Shareable Appetizers. Wine Down Tuesday - Half Off ALL Wine by the Glass & Bottle (All Day Tuesday) Recommendations:  Spinach Artichoke Dip, Chicken Wings, Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, Seared Ahi, Great White Pizza, Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, the California Burger and you definitely can't come here without having yourself a pazookie, my personal favorites are the white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie and the red velvet pazookie.

Mellanie D.,"San Jose, CA",170,231,222,3.0,11/20/2011,"When I think of BJs I think of their Pazooki!!! Definitely a must try even if you are full!  You have a lot to choose from on the menu from burgers, pizza, pastas, salads, steaks, salmon, ribs, pork chops, and various chicken dishes. They also have a gluten free pizza and you can get a gluten free pazooki! How awesome is that?!?! Been here a couple times with friends for lunch and was here recently for lunch after a movie. Service is ok as we were checked on from time to time and our drinks were filled right away if we asked or topped off if the waiter/waitress came by.  I must say their giant stuffed potatoes are really stuffed and big, BBQ chicken pizza is yum, and their spinach stuffed mushrooms and mac and cheese saved me as they were soft and easy to chew after getting my wisdom teeth pulled.  Downside is how busy the parking area is as its connected with the mall, movie theatre, other restaurants and the mall's food court. You are better off doing valet for $7 or parking and walking from the nearby garage (unless you like circling around or stalking someone who comes out to grab their parking spot).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=400

Melissa T.,"Fremont, CA",293,689,138,3.0,8/10/2011,"I've been to several BJ's and this one is probably the worst, so far. It's always super packed and LOUD. There's always a 20+ min wait for anything after happy hour. When it's packed, the servers will try to shuffle you to the crappy outdoor seating unless you protest.. which you should definitely do unless you are a masochist. This is where LARGE, drunk, screamy parties are sat and the suckers who agree to be sat near them will experience intolerable levels of noise. I don't know what makes the sound reverberate so loudly, but it's just intolerable and I would not advise anyone sit outside if any large parties are already there. As for the rest of the location, my main gripe is the slow and forgetful servers. Reminding people several times to bring me what I asked for 20 minutes ago isn't pleasant.  I'd only recommend this location for happy hour or lunch unless you're just coming here to enjoy the bar and/or get drunk.

This is a great place to catch up with a friend to grab some great nibbles and a cold beer.

The crust is thick and soft with a perfect crunch. Good selections available. - 1/2 off Wine on Tuesdays. - Good variety of items priced at $4, $5 and $6 during Happy Hour. - Great bar seating with booths, high table tops and a very long bar facing their huge tv screen. Sounds great! But... - Their Happy Hour items are EXTREMELY small. My friend had to order two Margarita flatbreads ($4 per flatbread) to satisfy his ""snack hunger"" - This is not a great place to come to hang out on weekend nights. Their bar tables and bar are usually packed and there is really no where to stand and wait. - Service is a hit or miss.

Richard C.,"Saratoga, CA",300,137,13,3.0,4/26/2014,"Sometimes you're grateful for the transparency that is provided by the nutritional facts on a menu and sometimes you're horrified by them. Kudos to BJ's for putting the caloric values next to each entree on the menu but now my life has been shattered realizing how, when you combine meat, cheese, batter, and deep frying, you get an entire day's worth of calories! I've been to BJs about 5 times and each time the food that I ordered was pretty good. Most recently I've had the roast beef french dip but opted to not have the cheese to save a few calories.  It was pretty good.  I'd say it's a 7 in an array of french dips that range from cheap, dried, and tasteless with canned gravy as ""au jus"" (your average pub or chain restaurant)  to tender and succulent (Los Altos Grill - which I routinely use as my high-end benchmark).  The meat was good, the bread not too doughy or overpowering and and jus was good (not too salty or fatty).   I don't get the beers at BJs (I'm sure they're good to most people) because after I had their sampler I pretty much verified that I only like light wheats or black stouts.  In between there are too many funky flavors between ambers, pale ales (most IPAs are too hoppy which too me tastes like boiled socks in dishwater), and reds. BJs is a good, consistent, brewhouse with good food and a lot of selection and great waitstaff (both the Cupertino and Oakridge locations have great servers!).

Mr. S.,"San Jose, CA",1,23,3,3.0,1/11/2016,"I don't know why people love this place so much. Honestly I think it's overhyped. Every time my friends or family drag me to this place, it's always a let down. The atmosphere and service is great though, so that's what pushed my rating from 2 up to 3. Starting with the food, it's all boring. Nothing special about their deep dish pizza. It's just like Pizza Hut's pan pizza. Super thick bread with cheese and toppings. Chicago-style would be so much better. The veggie burgers are average, and you can find better ones elsewhere. The thin and crispy fries were good. The tomato bisque soup was also good, though the sourdough bread bowl was bland and not sour at all. I liked the artichoke dip, though they only give a small amount for the price. And they got rid of the colored chips for plain white chips. The worst experience was with the beers. First, I appreciate that they have the 4 5oz taster flight option. This allowed me to taste 4 shit beers instead of just 1. I wanted their house porter and stout, as well as Santa Clara Valley Brewing's IPA and Red Ale. They were out of the red, so they gave me their house red. SCVB's IPA was pretty average for IPAs really, and that was the high point for the flight. Each house beer was terrible though. For one, I think both the stout and porter were on Nitro, since the beer was flat and the foam had fine, tiny bubbles, and I didn't notice that anywhere on the menu. I didn't like the nitro. In the end, I just got a 5th taster of Goose Island, which tasted great and washed away the taste of the bad ones that preceded it. On the way out, I saw they had Grand Cru, which I would have loved to try, but wasn't anywhere on the menu, nor on the drinks menu, nor on the little signs on the tables, so I didn't have the chance to order it sadly. I don't think I'd ever come back here for food. The atmosphere is pretty cool for hanging out with friends though, so I might be swayed on those grounds alone. Of course, there's plenty of other places in SJ to hang out too. No split checks, but they'll accept up to 5 cards if you do the math.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=440

Stephen R.,"San Jose, CA",137,252,188,4.0,7/30/2013,"This is a great place to go when looking to eat out late at night in South SJ. We called and put our name in as we were leaving the house and were seated right when we got there. They put is in the outdoor area which was quite nice even late at night, plenty of heaters out there. Our waitress was nice and friendly. The only speck in what would otherwise be flawless service was that I had to ask for ketchup twice. She quickly made up for this though by delivering freshly cooked fries with the ketchup. I added a star just for her doing this! Ive had plenty of dishes here in the past but this last time I went for the Double Deluxe Burger. This thing is HUGE, 2100 calories or so according to the menu. I also added the side salad. Overall the burger was good. A little greasy, but not to the point where the buns are soggy. I feel like the special sauce they use is a little tame, because to be honest it tasted like any other burger I've had. I think the sauce is what would (should) distinguish it from other burgers. The thin-cut fries were delicious!  No pizookie for us this time, I was stuffed. Food coma. Yes I literally did pass out the moment I got home, and even had a food hangover the next morning.

Calamari, this type of avocado eggroll, and such. Main dishes ain't to shabby, I don't really eat here for dinner, I just go here for a late lunch or lunch.  Enough about that, the desserts are so yummmmy. Pizookies are amazing! If you don't know what that is, it's a huge warm cookie with ice cream on top. You can have 2 different cookies in one dessert. For instance, red velvet cookie and chocolate chip cookie with scoops of vanilla ice cream.  White chocolate macadamia is pretty good also too!  So, you have to make room for dessert.

What compels me to write is when either something really stands out positively or drastically horrible.  I've noticed I didn't have a three star review yet, and after my visit to BJs last night, it screamed mediocre! Yet .... I cannot avoid this place. I've been here many of times. A lot with an alcoholic German ex-boyfriend (who loved the beer samplers) and the other times when my friends and I were craving a pizookie while shopping.  BJs does its theme well, which is, beer and an extensive menu. A place where groups are ideal, since there are a variety of options. Even the pickiest eaters are bound to find something they want.  I will speak about my experience last night.  Why in fucks sake did I come on a Friday night? I should have known better. It's like I had temporary Alzheimer's. After an hour wait, we were seated in a comfy booth. However the door opening and closing from the patio made it a quite chilly experience. The waitress greeted us and took our drink order. Since we have perused the menu during our hour wait, we were ready to order and get our hungry tummies filled ASAP.  I decided I wanted  variety of things. I ordered from the small bites menu. I ordered the chicken wontons (buffalo style), stuffed mushrooms, and mac n cheese.  So while we were sitting down, our waitress and her replacing waitress decided to talk about their schedule right in front of us. Meaning we had to stop our conversation so that the waitresses can continue their conversation regarding when she's taking her break or when she was leaving for the day. Ummm ok? She did apologize and honestly, its not a big deal. It was really awkward though.  I got my food. The mushrooms were cold and unremarkable. The wontons were pretty tasty and loved the buffalo style nature of it. Never knew Asian and New York American flavors go together. It was a fun dish.  Finally the mac n cheese. It didn't taste cheesy at all. It tasted like cold pasta with no sauce. It was sent back, the waitress happily obliged and took it off our bill.  We decided to share the trio pizookie dessert. Hot cookies and ice cream will never fail me. We had the macadamia nut, red velvet, and cookies and cream. Delicious, you can't go wrong. However, we received the bill prior to receiving our dessert. WAY PRIOR. It was just weird again. Then I noticed a bread plate going to our neighbors and I realized we never got our complimentary bread. Overall, the service was bust but unintentionally. They ladies were well meaning but just didn't have the training to provide good customer service. The food, meh. However I do still love their fish tacos (had them in previous visits) and the pizookie. Hence the three stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=440

I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to bring to attention the service these gents provided. I will come back when these 3 men are working. Thank you, Richard, Roddy, and Nereo. My friend and I had dinner to celebrate her birthday. I screwed up and didn't call 30 mins in advance like I was told to in order to have a shorter wait time upon arrival. The host(Richard) graciously helped me out and took care of everything despite the hassle I gave him(asking for ETA of a table for 2, thinking my friend would be late and giving up the table he'd given me, then sitting back down when she came on time). Props to him. Nereo was our server. He did the best he could what what he knew and had - I think he was a bit newer to the team. We weren't provided things that normally would be set already, but I understand he may be newer and looked a bit distressed. There was room for improvement for sure, but he courteously helped us out whenever we had requests. Our food was another story I wont' get into. Ordered 2 starters, and 2 entrees and had a couple things redone. It wasn't good and Nereo offered to ask the manager to speak with us. The manager(Roddy, I believe) was a nice man and asked us how our meal was, etc. He said he'd take care of it and ended up paying for the whole thing. I nearly flipped out because my entree was OK and was very resistant to the idea - he wouldn't budge though. Stand up guy. That's the service you'd expect at Alexander's or at Forbes Mill. Since we couldn't pay for the meal, I tipped Nereo about half of the bill because I felt bad for being picky(normal). This review is for the service alone, as I was a bit taken aback by the food(room temp and soggy calamari, bland&dry scampi pasta). My friend, the Bday girl is actually a really decent cook so we were saddened when the food didn't meet our standards or the other times we had frequented BJ's. Luckily, my friend's Pizookie didn't have sausage in it like a previous reviewer experienced.  All things said and done, we had a good experience and I would give this place 4 stars on service alone.

My friends and I wanted Pizookies only, so we ordered two of them. I handed him my menu and he just forcefully grabbed it from me (talk about rude). After we received our pizookies he handed us our bill right away (we didn't even ask for it). I opened it and encountered a smiley face with a forced ""Thank You"" on it. It kind of reminds me of two girls hating each other but not admitting it in person, so they force themselves to greet one another with a fake ""Heyyyyyyyyyyyy gurlllllll you look good today."" ""Oh so do youuuuuuu, did you just cut your hair?!? WHO DID YOUR NAILS?!! WHOOOO""  Just kidding, that was a little bit over the line. If he thought we weren't going to tip, he was completely wrong.

Stefany V.,"Las Vegas, NV",2181,3986,9966,3.0,10/15/2013,"I've been to BJ's before and was unimpressed- frankly, I think their prices are set a bit too high for what you get. But when BF and I saw their commercial for the current special, we went in- soup or salad, a medium pizza, AND a pizookie for $20? Not bad at all! Went in and there was a considerable wait due to the football crowd. Should have arrived sooner instead of at half time, oh well. Wandered the mall while we waited, then were seated and got a great server- unfortunately I can't remember his name.  Due to the good deal on the special, we felt comfortable ordering their seasonal pumpkin ale (which was AWESOME- not too sweet, not too pumpkiny, nice spice to it) and an appetizer of the chicken wontons. Unfortunately, the won tons order was not put in. By the time our server realized it, our pizza was out. Oops. We went ahead and cancelled it- we already had more than enough food and at that point, the purpose of an appetizer was moot. Started with the wedge salad with bleu cheese- love that salad, order it everywhere. Here, it's quite plentiful and the bacon is nice and crisp without crumbling apart. Very nice! Got the deep dish style pizza, half the Classic Combo and half the Favorite. Both were good, but I preferred the Combo- the veggies on the Favorite were not chopped very well and were quite large and undercooked. Not bad, but not my favorite, personally.  For the pizookie, we couldn't decide on a flavor so we had our waiter pick- got the macadamia nut white chocolate chip. Yum. Unfortunately this particular pizookie was very thin and overcooked- more than half of the cookie seemed to stick to the pan. Oh well, we really didn't need the extra calories.  Service was fine, especially considering the crowd and wait time. Server was polite and personable, and I tipped accordingly- with the deal and our beers, our order was a little over $30, without the deal it would have been closer to $45.  Will return to this location if in the area again while the special is still going, but it's not the closest one to me and their regular pricing does not appeal to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=420

I should've gotten my original choice because the red velvet cookie was way too sweet and the ice cream made it worse.  The food quality is alright. It isn't the best food ever, but it is decent enough and the prices are like any other restaurant. The food always looks rushed whenever I eat here though.

The food took an inordinate amount of time to come out, which the waiter apologized for.  And then I found multiple whole pepperoni slices in my calzone. Ugh. Waiter was apologetic and took it off the bill, offered to have it remade or a free dessert etc, but I didn't want to wait any longer than the two hours we'd already been there and declined. The more recent visit, we were seated in inside. The host sounded like he was reading a script. Eventually our waiter came over and took our drink/appetizer order..but not our meal order even though we were ready. He repeated that I said I wanted honey mustard on my salad. Eventually, I'm brought a salad with....ranch. Ok, don't really care so we ate it anyway. Main course seemed to take a while. Dining partner asked for a side of pesto with his flatbread and it didn't come, so we had to ask again. At some point later, he asked for a second order since the first cup was small.

Daniel B.,"Campbell, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/23/2015,"Had a terrible experience. Best thing was when i walked in someone was there to greet me, it was all downhill from there. We got out drinks ordered within a few minutes and when we ordered our food we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more. 25 minutes later i had to get up to ask for my check because my server had not once checked on us. Reminding everyone that the server had been back and forth past us multiple times. In addition after i asked for my check he then proceeded to bring the food. I told him i did not want the food in which he proceeded with the excuse of its fresh, and its all house made. I kindly told him no, just a check. The manager comped our drinks thank god and then she told me he had put the order in about 15 minutes ago. I was as this point frustrated because he had not been to our table for much longer than that meaning we had obviously not been important enough to eat there. I will never go back unless i have a group of my friends and its the ONLY place that someone can eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=420

Jon M.,"Little Elm, TX",216,133,43,4.0,2/11/2013,"I love going to BJ's.  This is a great atmosphere if you are in the mood for some drinks and some pretty good food.  BJ's own brew of beer is quite good as well.  I am a big fan of the Jeremiah Red.  They usually have some kind of seasonal beer too. If you are new to the place, try out the beer sampler.  They give you 7 sample's of their own brew from light to very dark. They have a great selection of food here and everything I have had has always been up to par. The food tastes good and it's hard to pick what you want from the vast selection.  I knocked it down 1 star because I have had a couple times where the service was pretty bad, but it wasn't that often.  Also, it can get kinda pricy between food and drinks.   Other than that, I love coming here and will continue to do so!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=420
Alex F.,"San Francisco, CA",237,99,61,3.0,4/7/2013,"Grades:  A) The seating area is comfortable and chill.  B) The prices are lower than the Cheesecake Factory.  C) Some of the food is actually better than the Cheesecake Factory.  D) The service is off and on, but most of the time pretty great.  E) If you're here late, enjoy watching the drunk suburban sports' fans at the bar. F) The manager doesn't like to work. He's lazy.  What's great is that they know who they're supposed to be. They're not trying to be something they're not, and that makes for a good restaurant. It's standard American fare, but curated and executed with restraint. Located next to the movie theaters, this is a great place to stop before or after a film. Or, you could take a stroll through the mall to knock off some of those pounds you just put on eating that Pizookie! If I had a friend from overseas visit me, and they wanted to try an ""All American"" dining experience... I would take them here. This is America, commercialized of course.

They also don't seem to know much about what's on their menu. Drinks/food take FOREVER to come out to your table. Basically you become frustrated by the time you get your food.

Tako B.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,34,1,2.0,10/30/2013,"This place is a hit or miss. Mostly miss though. I always make the mistake by coming here to eat instead of grabbing a beer to watch a game.  On game days it's packed and often the service is lousy. The wait can last for 30 - an hour on busy nights. I'd rather go to Cheesecake Factory if its busy then. The food is tastier and less salty than at Cheesecake Factory.  The problem with service is that you are often neglected. I've had a few waitresses end their shift in the middle of my meal without telling me. I have to flag down either the manager or another server to pay my bill.  Sometimes I go to the bar because the wait is too long but service there is the worst. When it gets busy sometimes you have to fight for your table which is exhausting and infuriating. And even when you get that table you dont even know if someone will come to serve you.  Last time I sat at the bar for a solid 20 minutes without getting any menus or any acknowledgement that I am there. And I'm sitting right in front of the bartender. He rather sell drinks than tell me to wait a few minutes. It was a pretty bad experience getting ignored like that especially when there were 2 bartenders. I got up and left and went to Cheesecake Factory where the service is a lot better.  Down to the food. If you look at the menu most of the entrees are 1400+ calories which is pretty steep. Cheesecake Factory is worse but this is pretty bad. Even the healthiest salad is 700 cal. But the food is good here and the beer selection is good so go early when it isn't as busy. if youre going healthy the ahi tuna salad is good. If you would like something more caloric then the piranha pale ale nachos, piranha pale ale burger are good. I also like the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. The other dishes are good too. I would avoid the pulled pork sandwich too salty for my taste. I tend to think their pizzas are way too dry. But a lot of people still get them. The pizookie is a must if you have enough room for your stomach and your wallet. All in all go when less busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=460

I did the call ahead thing and it worked for us. got seated in 20+ mins and then the shitty part happens.  I had to ask my waiter 2x for lemon for my water. and I'm not mad about that, I understand it is Saturday and it's busy. we placed in our order and out came our appetizer + a bowl of clam chowder. one spoonful and I was in awe. it was so bloody SALTY i practically finished my cup full of water. DISGUSTING. i flagged down my waiter and told him the situation and had him take back the chowder and give me two servings of broccoli.  entrees began coming out and the steak with two servings of broccoli only came with one, the kale and brussels sprout salad had none of the sort (just romaine and grapes ... WTF?!), my shrimp scampi pasta tasted like plain noodles with shrimp, which I could have done at home myself for a lot cheaper.  then i told my waiter again, about my second serving, him coming back 3x to check if it had arrived which it did not and he having to go to the back himself to see what is going on. it is steamed broccoli, it shouldn't take that long. finally it came and it was just 3 pieces. THREE! if that is a serving, please just keep it. it was just ridiculous.  never again will I be back, especially to this location. this place is overpriced and it's not even worth it.

Richard N.,"San Jose, CA",174,239,,3.0,7/18/2010,"The All-American Meal ( for better or worse ), BJ's Brewhouse is the type of place someone might go for a meal after they graduate from McDonald's to Denny's and are ready for the next step. BJ's joins a long list of restaurants offering similar fare...at least in price and style...such as Applebee's, The Olive Garden, Chili's and California Pizza Kitchen, to name a few found in the San Jose area.  These ""mid-tier"" places are the backbone of our ""let's eat out and not spend too much"" economy.  Solid and value-oriented with a cheerfulness provided mostly by older teenagers and people working through college. BJ's on ""restaurant row"" in the Oakridge Shopping Center facing Blossom Hill Road fits that mold quite nicely.  The menu is a combination of what seems to sell the most...a little of this and that... with an emphasis on comfort food.  Nothing really strays far from ""down the middle"", but that's probably one of its major attractions.  There's enough variety for everybody in the group from a vegetarian to someone wishing to eat red meat til the blood rushes out your mouth. Quality of food at BJ's, based on several visits over the years, is probably a notch about its peers.  Of course, it all depends on your expectations.  When I consider going to BJ's, it best to check my hankering for fancy food at the door.  A little perspective goes a long way with any restaurant. Since my wife and I haven't had mead, except for chicken and a little turkey, for the past 20 years, we usually order chicken dishes or a veggie burger or salads.  Most everything is tasty, the right temperature and worth the price.  I'm a particular fan of the wedge cut fries.  Big pieces of potato, light-moderately fried and warm.  I even go lightly on the ketchup.  Now that's a compliment. But I must register a note of disappointment.  I usually order a ""wedge salad"" of iceburg lettuce and blue cheese dressing with my meal.  While I realize my eyesight is fading fast, I'd swear those salads are getting smaller.  Maybe they're just giving us a ""wedgie"" these days. Drinks of all sorts highlight many pages of the spiral bound menu.  Beers and martinis take center stage and I've tried most of the former ...though not all at the same time.  I haven't found my ideal combination of flavor, color and aftertaste, but BJ's usually has at least 8 of their own mixtures available so there's probably something for everyone.  There are also a number of ice teas and feedback from my wife has been good. Service is what you might call ""perky"".  I define that as upbeat and friendly which befits a restaurant of this type and age of the servers, both male and female.  If a fork is missing or extra napkins are needed, you'll get them ASAP with a smile. So far, BJ's is shaping up for 4 stars.  However, there are a couple of reasonable nits to pick.  For a restaurant of significant size, both inside and on the 2 sided patio, the restrooms should be larger.   After you've downed a couple of beers or ice teas, the last thing you want is to wait in line on a wet floor.  Maybe if customers had more ""room"" to put everything they'd be tempted to order another round. Another thing I've noticed on repeat visits is the tendency to let the waiting list grow despite the appearance of open tables.  I've seen tables stay empty for 10 minutes while people grumble by the reception area or sit on benches just outside the front door.  If that occurred once or twice, I'd say it's due to understaffing, but I've watched it many times. The last item may be a negative, depending on your viewpoint.  The average age of people at dinner is young...very young.  Of course you'll find the usual mix of families and couple, but the group that tilts the balance are packs ( not in a derogatory sense ) of teenagers.  They're generally well behaved, but if 3-5 kids with shopping bags in the next booth at dinnertime are not your cup of tea ( or beer ), it's something to consider.  And the room can get noisy from the bank of TVs on the walls, background music, waves of patrons and the lack of proper acoustics.  But again, maybe that's the way they want it. Like I said way back at the beginning, BJ's is the next rung on a ladder for the upwardly mobile..or for hungry people just looking for a middle of the road experience. Pros:   Reasonable food at reasonable prices with smiling service.  Lots of beer. Cons:   Lots of beer.  Small bathrooms.  Sometimes crowded with ""mall kids"".  Noisy. Ratings: -   Overall:      3 -   Food:          3 -   Service:      4 -   Atmosphere:   2 -   Facilities:   3 -   Parking:     3  ( big lots are often full )",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=460

Candice T.,"Burlingame, CA",519,377,312,4.0,11/18/2012,"When I go to BJ's, it's usually for two things: giant baked potatoes and cider. This visit struck me as unusual for a couple of reasons. First of all, I looked over the menu and the first thing to catch my eye and grab me by the stomach was the prospect of mahi mahi. That delectable white fish will always make me do a double-take. And second of all, there were a few dishes that were vying for my attention. I settled on the mahi tacos. I loved their avacado salsa, but overall, the tacos could stand to have more fish in them. Boyfriend reported dry pork chops, while still very flavorful. I can attest to his delicious mashed potatoes myself.  I guess the final unusual piece of my visit came after dinner, when I had no leftovers to take home. I wasn't uncomfortably full, but I was certainly cleaning my plate and ""taste-testing"" my SO's sides.

Allen R.,"San Jose, CA",180,14,101,2.0,7/22/2013,"I worked retail in Oakridge Mall for a year and would commonly eat lunch at BJ's. I was attracted to the food selections, but progressively the taste and the service got worse and worse.  On numerous occasions our party would alert the waiter that we were on a 1 hour lunch, and on almost all of those occasions we wouldn't receive our food until after 40 minutes of being seated (while ordering within 5 minutes of arriving).  THE FOOD: I ordered the fried shrimp most often, and I always complained about either the fries being cold and/or the shrimp being cold and not fresh tasting. It got to the point where they'd ask if I wanted ""wedges"" or ""thin fries"" and I'd answer, ""whichever is hotter""... to which they'd stare blankly... to which after receiving my fries I would send back for hotter ones.   I like the watermelon feta salad the best. It is $2.99 and it tastes fresh.  The pizza is interesting... I've tried many, and they all taste good, not great, nothing to write home about.  SUMMARY: If you're coming to drink and chill with friends it is a good place to go as they have tons of drinks and the ambiance is nice. I do NOT reccomend this place to my friends, and I avoid it whenever given a choice between BJ's, Chili's, Fridays, Outback, etc..

Michael B.,"Redwood City, CA",0,29,,1.0,10/5/2013,"Last night was an absolutely terrible experience at BJ's. It was date night with my daughter and we were looking forward to spending time together having dinner and shopping at the mall. I have been to several BJ's, the one near Apple Computer in Cupertino and the one in Sacramento which were both GREAT and was looking forward to my dinner at Oakridge. Instead, the entire experience from start to finish was terrible.  When we arrived the front counter informed us the wait would be 30-40 minutes. Being told that the buzzer would not reach past the Mac store inside the mall we were stuck hanging around in front of the restaurant. Finally, after 58 minutes we were seated. During our wait we continually checked with the front counter for updates and their response was always the same....two more parties in front of you and it will only be another 3-5 minutes....clearly, the folks working the reservation system did not know what they were doing. Once seated we were excited to eat. Unfortunately, it wasn't for another 15 minutes that the waitress actually came to our table. On multiple occasions she stopped by to say she would be right back to take our order but never actually did. Finally, after the long wait she took our order...and then the long wait began. In fairness to the wait staff, my daughters soup and salad came within a reasonable amount of time but, unfortunately, her tomato bisque soup was stone cold. Sending it back we waited another 5 minutes before it was heated so I asked my daughter to start her meal while I waited for my fried chicken to arrive....and I waited and I waited and I waited.... 20 minutes later my chicken arrived. My heart sank when I looked at the entrée as the dish wasn't really fried chicken but a chicken fried steak. To make things worse the presentation looked like the chicken had fallen out of the sky into a cornfield sending the corn kernel out of the husk and splattering them all over my dish. It was hideous.  By this point I was thoroughly disgusted and asked to see the manager. 5 minutes later I spoke with him...he was nice enough...and I explained my problem. His response was that he asked me to forgive the terrible experience as everyone in the restaurant was new and getting trained. He said he had been brought over from the Infinite Circle BJ's to straighten things out but that he knew they were having problems. In a kind gesture he comped the cost of my meal....6.95...but by then the night had been lost. By the time it was over...well after 10:00... the mall stores had closed and I lost my chance to finish the date with my daughter. We left for Starbuck's and a Frappuccino which is always done right and then came home. Do yourself a favor....stay away from the Oakridge BJ's as you will be very disappointed. Their other locations are always spot on and I'm sure this one will be as well.....but like my wait outside....it will take a lot longer than they will tell you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=560

Loren C.,"Miami, FL",322,67,72,2.0,7/21/2013,"Usually my friends and I will just pop in for a late night pizookie, or a baked potato, and the food is decent. The service has never been exceptionally good here, but we never really minded. Sometimes the wait is long, and other times you get seated right away. It really just depends on what time you get there. The worst experience I had there was when my boyfriend and I were out on a date. We both ordered appetizers, and they came pretty quickly. I had the fried artichoke hearts, which were decent, although not something I'll ever go back for, and he had the mozzarella sticks. They weren't anything special either. Both appetizers were pretty bland, and such a waste of money. For our main course I ordered a grilled salmon Caesar salad, and this is where things went bad. It took them an incredibly long time to bring out our food, much longer than it should have. When it was brought out to me, it was more like a stack of lettuce than a salad. There was literally no dressing on 2/3rds of my salad! I could pick up a scoop of lettuce with my bare hands and no dressing would get on me at all. I asked our waiter for extra dressing, but I only got it after I had decided to stop eating. The reason that I stopped eating my ""salad"" was because I was continuously finding brown pieces of wilting lettuce throughout my salad. At first I attributed the brown pieces to being rubbed up against my grilled salmon, but I found a large number of pieces of ROTTING lettuce buried at the bottom of my salad on the opposite end of my plate from my salmon fillet. It was disgusting that they would serve rotten food like it was nothing! I found the head of the lettuce, rotten, thrown into my salad as well! I wondered if they had put all the throw away pieces on a plate and mistaken it for my salad... Needless to say, I was thoroughly disgusted and couldn't continue eating it. We pointed it out to the waiter and asked to speak with the manager about it. The manager took a while to come out and speak with us, but she apologized for the wait and thanked us for being patient, and offered us a replacement salad, or anything else off of the menu. I declined, because I was too grossed out to eat anything else from their kitchen. She removed the charge from our bill, and was very kind about the whole situation, which we appreciated.  Needless to say, we will not be returning for anything other than a pizookie in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=560

The first time I went I was thinking the food was average but maybe it was what I chose. My recent visit was great! I have the Chicken Marsala, Piranha Pale Ale Chili, Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, and a Wildberry Mojito. The chili was good but I felt it was a bit cold maybe due to the glob o sour cream put on on. Otherwise it was very good. The Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms were very good as well. This would make it the second time I've had it and as I recall, not as salty as it was the first time. The Chicken Marsala was pretty good. I just wish there was a bit more pasta. The majority of the dish was the chicken, the mushrooms, and green beans. I guess the green beans are there to make you feel less guilty about how many calories are in the dish :-). The Wildberry Mojito was very good but I wish the taste of mint of more prominent. Don't get me wrong, the drink tasted great and gave me a good buzz. Compared to other places though, it could have had a bit more mint taste. Overall my experience this time was great.

Katherine N.,"San Jose, CA",212,2,,4.0,8/17/2013,"Many individuals have high expectations from a restaurant in terms of the variety & quality of food, the service, & atmosphere. I, for one, have very high expectations when it comes to eating in a restaurant but at the same time am very understanding. Let's start with the service. BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse contains many varieties of servers which will be randomly selected in accord to which table we sit in. We have to accept the fact that there will be good & bad servers which is apparent in every restaurant. Having one bad server does not define the whole quality of the restaurant because there are some pretty great & enthusiastic servers that we have to miss out on. Random selecting can be unfortunate sometimes. Fortunately, I had a decent, generous server who took our orders well & delivered our food & beverages quickly & gracefully. Yes, it was busy & the server didn't give as much attention towards us, but it's understandable. We weren't the only ones in the restaurant & I was glad that he showed how much he cared.  There are many varieties of food in the menu. It's like a novel! For the food, I ordered ahi poke for starters & a grilled atlantic salmon. Both of the food were FANTASTIC. The appetizer came out on time & although the salmon took a little bit longer than I thought, it was fine. I had a really good time eating with my friends. I would highly recommend any seafood dish at BJ's! At the end, we shared an oreo pizookie which was incredibly mouthwatering & tasty. It was my first time trying a pizookie, so I realize that I found my new craving! The atmosphere was beautiful. There are many diversities in the restaurant & everything was pretty clean & classy.  Overall, my experience was great. I would give it 4 stars! Expect me to come back hungry for more. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=540

So as prepared food goes, I'm not the biggest fan.  If you're a fan of DEEP DISH pizzas and have had them in Chicago, theirs might disappoint.   I am a fan of their bars and TVs.  I occasionally enjoy a bottle of cider and its nice that they carry them.  Some BJs only carry a PEAR cider, this one also offers a BERRY cider.  Make sure to carry your ID, they will ask.

The host/?assistant host (a Hispanic or eastern Asian young man) did not great us when we came in. He ignored us for two minutes. Then he didn't want to give us high chairs, only boosters even though our babies are only 15 months and not ready for them. Finally another hostess (african american woman) who was slightly friendlier got us high chairs and sat us. Our waiter was okay but didn't give us silverware, we had to ask for it, and only gave it to one of us. He didn't ask if we were enjoying our food. He brought things pretty quickly including the check (which was a good thing). A man started cleaning the floor with a broom (our two babies threw a decent amount on the floor but it wasn't a huge mess), before we even had gotten up to leave or started to leave. We were very disappointed by this experience.  The hosts need to work on people skills and always offer people with babies high chairs, it shouldn't be an inconvenience to get one.

We came here last Sunday and we expected a wait. It gets really busy here on weekends. We were given a buzzer and sat on the benches right outside the door. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes, but after 25 minutes and watching people come after us and be seated before, we approached the counter and we were told that they called us already. I told them that the buzzer didn't go off. They said that they had been having trouble with them lately and that it's best for us to stay closeby so we can hear them call our name. She assumed we wandered off. There were probably 6 people sitting on the benches and there is NO way we wouldn't have noticed the door opening and our names being called. They didn't bother calling for us outside. So we get seated and it takes forever for our server to approach and ask about drinks, we were ready to order by then. We get our drinks and wait. Our salads are brought to us at the same time as our meal. I hate that, like I'm going to eat a salad while my dinner gets cold or something. So we decided to give them a second chance today. It's a Monday, not busy, service should be good. We get seated right away and our server comes up quickly. My drink is brought to the table and the glass is dirty with chunks of food stuck to the outside.  Our salad and soup STILL come at the same time as the food. The garlic bread is so hard I couldn't bite into it and there was a broccoli in my spaghetti.  I'm fed up at this point.

So we found a table sat down and maybe 5 minutes goes by and they brought us a menu and asked us for our drink orders. The guy took our order and walked off. We sat there for 20 MINUTES and no drinks. We never saw the waiter even come out, so we left and went to California Pizza Kitchen. We attempted this place again today and the host again said there would be a 15 minute wait. So 25 minutes goes by and we walk back in to see if.our table was ready the host said 5 more minutes and we would be next. We waited 10 more minutes and I said forget it and we left.

By which time we've already decided on appetizers as well. Let's just say the WHOLE night was a lot of waiting on our waitress.. Ordered a Cajun Pasta with Chicken AND Shrimp. Somehow the waitress entered Cajun Pasta with Salmon (WTF?!) the first time and Cajun Pasta with Shrimp ONLY the second time (with undercooked pasta bc according to the waitress she rushed the kitchen). I don't think I could've been more clear with the order. I DO NOT have an accent but apparently the waitress has issues hearing. Needless to say we didn't want to send the food back a third time because (1) we were hungry & tired and (2) we didn't want angry spit in our food. You best bet that Wendy didn't get the generous tip we originally set out to give her! I will NEVER return to this location.

My boyfriend had to go ask a server to serve us, and she told our server who a couple minutes later came back to take our order. I ordered the steak and a baked potato and asked if i could also get vegetables on the side. The manager came by about 15 minutes later and informed me that they were out of that steak and he could get me another type... that's fine. So our server drops our food at the table and leaves, not even noticing that we had no silver ware. After waiting for a few minutes we got up and got our own. Then i notice my vegetables are not on the side but INSIDE my baked potato!!! What is that???? Anyways, the steak was decent and the pizza my boyfriend ordered was fine, but nothing special. My boyfriend had to flag down our server to ask him to refill his diet coke... which was never brought back to the table. Finally we asked for the check and our server, who im surprised has a job never came by to pick up the check and just left us sitting there.

I don't think I need to mention their Pizookie which is pretty good considering I'm not really a sweets fan. I have tried the ""trio"" Pizookie which is three personal Pizookies that are perfect for sharing. You can pick and choose which variety you like. I had the Macadamia nut, Peanut Butter and Red Velvet cake ones. Out of those I probably wouldn't mind returning just for the Macadamia nut.  The reason for my three stars is due to service errors.

Potato Skins and Wings are pretty good. Love their mozzarella and tomato salad on their small bites menu. Very light and refreshing! Instead of my usual soup and salad combo (they don't have Minestroni soup on Saturdays anymore, boo :( ), for dinner I ordered a mini Classic Combo deep dish pizza (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and stewed tomatoes).

The food is always great.  Their chicken wings are among the best you can get.  Crispy, large, juicy, a very good hot sauce on the side.  The potato skins are deep fried, the sliders are very good, the microbrew is excellent.  The deep dish pizza always has a great crust with a slight crisp, yet chewy/soft on the inside with great toppings. Get a pazookie if you've never had one.  I'm partial to the Oreo pazookie.  It is a half-baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream. The wait at this location is always long (connected to Oarkridge mall) and the service is hit and miss.  One time we went and they were out of wings (what??) and they have messed up our pizza order more than once, though corrected it and even gave us a free pizza once!

It's a 15 yard radius (no lie, I have no idea how far that is), but just letting you know in case you're good with your measurements.  I started the night with the Brewhouse Blonde - very light, refreshing, and kinda fruity. Probably your GF's favorite beer. I'd order this again, but then again, I'm a girly beer girl.  As for the food, I went knife & fork sandwich for the first time. What an interesting concept! Got the Angus Pot Roast Sandwich, which came with mashed potatoes, celery, carrots, raw onions, pot roast, and toasted garlic French bread. Drenched with so much gravy, it was pretty fulfilling!

We didn't receive our silverware until what seemed like hours later, and we had to bother our waitress countless times before it actually went through her head that I couldn't eat a salad without a fork. Thank you for making my appetizer very enjoyable to eat. My croutons were soggy to the core!! You think I was happy with this?

Thuy T.,"San Jose, CA",404,55,1375,1.0,5/4/2014,"I get that the restaurant gets busy on a Friday evening, but to mess up our orders consistently throughout the night is not an exception. My boyfriend and I arrived around 6pm and found out their happy hour was still going on. We decided to seat ourselves in the bar area and shortly after, we were greeted by our lovely waitress. If I could recall correctly, I had asked the waitress the different types of dressings that came with the salads and in return I got my options with some attitude. My boyfriend and I then ordered our two appetizers, a pizza, dessert, and drinks. One of our appetizers came out super quick so we were certainly happy with that. The pizza came out second and we were both curious as to where our second appetizers went? We immediately flagged down our waitress and she told us that she completely forgot to place the order. We also told her that we didn't get our water or beer yet. She apologized and vanished. After minutes and minutes, she was nowhere to be found so we went ahead and flagged down a worker nearby to assist us. When we finally got all of our food in front of us, I decided to jump on the wagon and try one of BJ's delicious happy hr margaritas. Flagged our waitress down, ordered, waited, waited, waited, waited...and guess what? My drink never came out... At this moment, I just wanted to pay and leave.

Deekay V.,"San Jose, CA",8,67,44,3.0,3/16/2013,"So we came back here again on a Saturday giving this place another try. (also because I got a gift card). But aside from that, we avoided the lunch rush and was seated immediately. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We decided to skip on appetizers this time to save room for desserts. More on that in a bit.  My brother and bf each had a burger and I ordered a California club flatbread pizza. Their burgers were beyond dry! Even the buns were toasted to the point of dryness. I didn't have any but man did it look dry. My brother couldn't finish it because he was choking on every bite and finally gave up. My flatbread on the other hand was pretty good. It had a nice crisp to it and the flavors were well balanced. So our lunch meal obviously had mixed reviews.  After that, we wanted some pizookies since I was craving them. We ordered the trio and chose white chocolate chip, red velvet, and white chocolate raspberry almond pizookies. Boy were they delicious! You have to have a piece the minute it arrives at your table. The ooey gooey softness of the cookie along with some cold ice cream, ooh they make your eyes roll. But if you let it cool for a while, everything will taste super sweet and it could get quite sickening. Trust me, even with three small pizookies, we had a hard time finishing those. Overall, the food was alright. We came here twice in the past year and twice had issues with our food.

By the time we were seated, I could have ate the menu. After flip flopping between the balsamic chicken (my usual) or a pizza, my bf and I decided to split a medium Buffalo Chicken pizza. The portion was huge and we ended up having to box two slices home. (Turns out, what we really wanted to get was the BBQ Chicken pizza but I guess that gives us a reason to come back and try it some time in the future).  After our main courses, we decided to have a pizookie party!!! It has to be sacrilege to go to BJ's and not order their famous dessert. I don't know. I could probably make it at home but it would not taste the same.  My only complaint is that our waiter was slow when it came to refilling water. To be fair, I drink water like nobody's business.

I ordered the cream soda and scampi pasta. My boyfriend ordered the pink lemonade and new orleans jambalaya. We also got the ahi poke for our appetizer.  The ahi poke wasn't what I expected at all. The flavor of the wonton really overpowered the tuna and there were chunks of avocado. Overall it seemed to be lacking some flavor or a sauce.  The scampi pasta was delicious though! It was flavorful and the shrimp wasn't too overcooked or undercooked. I'll probably be getting it again :)  My boyfriends dish was also really good! A little bit too much butter for my liking but that can easily be fixed. It came with shrimp and chicken! Plus the rice was really well cooked.  Knocked a star off though for the ahi poke and the waitress who took waaaay too long to take our order.

The service is always stupendous, however, having worked in the food industry I give what I want and I am always extra nice. Try their beers, I personally do not like their new one they are advertising, and you can try it for free a little sample, or buy the sampler which is duh, all of the beers that they brew themselves. So you are bound to find a beer for you.  I can recommend tons of things to get but you should stop in and try what you like. I have been here the past two days on gf dates and they have AWESOME lunch deals with tons of stuff to get. They also have tons of pizookies to offer now!! I cannot try anything else other than the red velvet one, it is simply to die for! Definitely come in if you are a tourist and have never heard of BJ's lol because you will not regret it.  I have also been to and planned my own birthday dinner here and I really recommend just reserving, I cannot remember the amount that you have to reserve for and the max they allow before they make you do a buffet and have everyone pay a flat rate and they give you options, I honestly would not recommend the latter, just get your group ready, call it in and order whatever you all want separately NOT A BUFFET, and make sure your cheap friends have their monies lol.  Oh and speak up!

For a party of 6, we started out with the combo appetizer. Blah!! I would NOT get this again. Their eggrolls are completely filled with avacado, the spinach dip was not up to par and it seems like everything else was soaked in oil. Be on the safe side and get the chicken wings instead.  For entree, we got the Chicken Fettucini Alfredo and shared a Large BJ's Favorite Pizza. Two entrees between the six of us was more then enough. We even got a to-go box because we had extra food. The birthday girl loved the pizza but it was average to everyone else at the table. As far as the Fettucini Alfredo, it seems like they purchased a jar of afredo sauce at the supermarket and poured it over the pasta. Nothing special at all.  The best part was the dessert. We got the trio Pizookie so we can try all the different cookies. They even gave us an extra one because it was my sister's bday. That was very nice of them :)  Unless you love pizza, I wouldn't bother coming here. If you must, make sure you have room for dessert because thats the best part of the whole meal.

Calamari - overcooked/chewy , it left a batter-y taste in my mouth (ew), I like calamari, it's edible, but not great. Southwestern mini pizza - chipotle tomato sauce with spicy blackened chicken, green chilies, cheddar cheese and diced tomatoes topped with fresh cilantro. I'm surprised how soft the dough is and that i was able to cut through it with just a butter knife.  The sauce didnt have any taste of chipotle.  The tomatos and chicken were good though.  Overall, it's cool, but lacking anything to wow me. Great White mini pizza - Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, fresh Roma tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast. If you're allergic to cheese or lactose intolerant, this is probably your choice in pizza.  Its like a pizza version of pasta alfredo.  The alfredo sauce was flavorful enough to match the pizza dough.  I like garlic, there wasn't enough for me though.   Come early if you want to get HH because the lines/wait got crazy after we got in.

The next hour and a half we would wait for food in the meanwhile my daughter could not sit still and banged her head on the table, I should of known better and asked again but I didn't want to be rude!!

Shabnam J.,"San Jose, CA",420,56,9,1.0,12/31/2013,"This place is a joke. When it first opened the food actually wasn't bad and I absolutely loved their deep dish pizzas. However, the quality has gone downhill the past couple of years. I went there last night to celebrate my brother's birthday with my family (his choice) and it honestly was a horrible dining experience. To start, the waiter took ages to take our order. But whatever, I let that go. Our appetizers come out which were fine, but with no plates. Umm how exactly are we supposed to eat the food without a plate? I'd rather not use the table as my own personal plate, thank you. Once the plates finally did come out (appetizers definitely weren't hot anymore) the waiter had to make 3 different trips because the plates he brought were dirty each time. What are the chances that 3 different trips result in dirty plates?? Can we say UNSANITARY?!? And to add to that he kept trying to clean them by scratching off the leftover food with his finger...god knows what they do in the back when the customer isn't looking. Once we finished our appetizers my mom's dinner (soup and salad) came out 10min before everyone else's food and she obviously waited for our dinner to come out so she had to send her soup back since it was cold now...who would've thought (no apologies either from the staff). Finally our food comes out (took much longer than any other restaurant that I've been to) and of course my plate is wrong. I had asked for the spaghetti with grilled chicken and add basil. Instead I get a regular spaghetti plate and another plate with the grilled chicken pasta and no basil to be found. Why in the world would I order 2 pasta dishes???? And to top that off, the waiter had came back to the table to confirm my order with me after he entered it into the system. Honestly how difficult is it to get an order right? Staff as a whole needs some major re-training. AND when the bus boy was giving us our dinner plates, he completely knocked over my mom's ice cold water glass all over her with one of the plates in his hand and he acted so cavalier about it that I was in complete awe. He pretty much acted like it was her fault for having her glass there. Hello, it's your job to learn how to put plates down without knocking things over! If you can't handle it, then bring out less plates at once rather than 5 large ones. I finally ended up getting my corrected plate and the quality was whatever. Chicken was good, but sauce tasted like it was from a can. We got the check at the end and of course the two pasta dishes were still on there. You would think the waiter would've gone in and corrected that. Complete lack of attention.  All in all, I'm never going back even if it's somebody else's choice. There is no point, especially since Cheesecake Factory is right there and their food is always good and service is much better. They also have a ""Skinny Menu"" that actually tastes good unlike BJ's low calorie menu. I've given this place way too many chances and have been disappointed every time the past 3 years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=500
Megan L.,"San Jose, CA",16,12,5,2.0,4/1/2013,"The food here is pretty good. However, if you plan on going here on a friday or saturday night, expect a long wait. Don't even bother trying to place a to-go order on a busy night! My parents love the food here, but every time I call to place an order I get left on hold-- last time I had to call 4 times and wait over 40 minutes to talk to someone at the take-out desk! Also, they will tell you that the order will be done in 20 minutes, and then when you show up 20 minutes later they will make you wait for another 40 before your order is ready! The workers are very polite, but it is still some of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had, repeated on many occasions. As I said previously-- pretty good food if you don't mind the wait, but SO not worth ordering for take out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=500
Ewa H.,"San Jose, CA",1,13,1,1.0,1/4/2012,"So my friends and I using our day off (Jan2)to get some bargains at the mall and had a craving for BJ's.  We love their appetizers and of course, the pizookie.  Who doesn't love the pizookie?  The wait was crazy, but we held out since we could see all the yummy food being served.  There were quite a few tables that were empty, but the wait was almost 45 mins to 1hr  for 3 people.  When we were finally seated, the wait staff was running like chickens with their heads cut off.  When our waiter came by to get our drink order, we asked him what was up. He said the manager didn't expect the restaurant to be so busy so they understaffed.  WOW.  I'm surprised that they didn't staff up on a day that most people have off from work. We order some fun martinis since we know we'll be at the mall for awhile, and start off with some appetizers.  Well, we are waiting... and waiting... for our drinks, but to no avail.  Our appetizers come, and once we are almost done with them, our drinks arrive!!  The bar is backed up... the waiter apologizes.  Okay, i get it.   No problem. But wow... almost 30 mins for drinks?!?! He comes to get our entree order (not sure why he waited till after we ate our appetizers) but I order my favorite, the sesame chicken salad.  Since it's the new year, I'm sticking to my new years resolution of not eating meat. So I order the salad with no chicken and potato skins with no bacon.  So when I've ordered dishes with no meat at other places, they either discount the dish by a few bucks or give you more veggies to compensate.  Ummm, not BJ's.  Of course, I understand the potato skins only have the bacon as a garnish, but the chicken salad has substantial chicken on it!  And the salad didn't come out bigger than usual... it was just the same size salad with no chicken!  For a salad that costs almost $12, I would think there would be some discount if it was ordered with no meat. I asked to see a manager, just to inquire about how they accommodate guests that don't eat meat and if there exists and type of discount for dishes that exclude meat.  The place was so busy that they didn't really care to get me a manager.  We paid the bill, but waited to talk to someone.  It was clear that I was a last priority.  They wanted the table since they were so backed up with guests, that we left without talking to anyone. I'm giving 1 star for bad customer service.  Essentially, it was the principle of the matter.  I don't care if the food is great and people are lined up to eat there, but if you treat your customers badly, it will essentially erode your feeling about the place.  It was just a series of customer service errors that makes me not want to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=500
Joshua M.,"Painted Post, NY",110,217,29,4.0,1/3/2013,"Who doesnt love BJ""s, honestly. Tasty beer, huge menu filled with tasty items and great staff. My only negative on BJ's is the wait, it's all about timing it right at this location. Hit then 20-30 min before the normal rush and you are golden, hit them during the rush and you'll get the 45-60 min wait... Anyway, I really enjoy BJ's, the menu is huge. Really is something for everyone, and they do a nice job on all the items I've tried. Tonight my wife and I shared the calamari appetizer, which was great. The calamari were cooked really well (not rubbery) and had a tasty batter. I also had a calzone and a beer which hit the spot while my wife enjoyed the chicken parm. On other trips to BJ's I've tried the burgers, chicken fingers, etc and always have been happy.

Bill B.,"San Jose, CA",78,34,38,4.0,12/1/2010,"BJ's is hit or miss on some of their dishes, but has constancy on others. This is not a fine dining place, so check your pretentiousness at the door. People come here for beer, sports on the HD TVs and a TGI Friday's like atmosphere.  The micro-brew is okay. I am a fan of the Piranha Pale Ale. Rockbottom Brewery has better beer. I love that they try to add other hard to find beers on tap. For a while they had Arrogant Bastard on tap. Wow! Sure, not hard to get a bottle of it, but I have never seen it on tap anywhere else in the San Jose area. So, for beer: B/B+ The burgers are great! The burger melt is one of my favorite burgers around! It can get messy because the toasted sourdough bread can get too soggy and fall apart (I like ketchup, mustard and mayo so I make a messy burger).  The pizza is pretty good. Not the best pizza around, but still a B/B+ on most nights.  The ribs are good. Much better than Chili's ribs. Sure a true rib connoisseur  will scoff at the chain ribs, but there is no need for that. As far as chain ribs goes, these are also a B/B+. I love the California Chicken and Grilled Chicken Club sandwiches. My family loves the Pizookie for dessert. I swear that they have gotten smaller over the years, but I may be imagining it. Still worth ordering, but with parties of more than four or if you have big eaters, I suggest getting two. There was a point a year or so ago that BJ's consistently had a 90min or more wait at night. That's crazy. It is not worth a 90 minute wait. Still, worth an enjoyable night out with friends or family. I also recommend lunch at the bar. It is A-Okay. Update: I recently had the BJ's Hop Storm IPA and a bowl of chili. The IPA was quite good. They have different IPA recipes, so Hop Storm is not always on tap. The Chili was good, but Rockbottom Brewery has much better chili. BJ's was a bit on the thin side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=500

Jim O.,"Gilroy, CA",0,48,,2.0,5/4/2014,"I've been to BJ's several times. I keep trying to like the place, and they keep doing crap to thwart my good intentions. Today it was a boneless wings appetizer. From a choice of several glazes/sauces, I selected the sweet honey/Teriyaki glaze, because ALL of the other choices were described as hot or spicy. When this appetizer came, there were so many red pepper flakes in the glaze that it was inedible.  I understand why bars serve hot spicy food -- it helps them sell more beer. (It's the same reason that popcorn at the ball park is too salty -- it helps them sell more beer.) And while I don't like spicy foods, any restaurant is free to serve all the hot, spicy dishes they want to. But when I order something that's listed as a ""sweet honey Teriyaki"" glaze, and its principal characteristic is that it burns the hell out of my mouth., that is not acceptable.  I guess no matter how much I like the concept and the atmosphere, I just have to resign myself to the fact that if I ever go back to BJ's again, either this location or any other location, I'll just end up mad at myself for being so gullible.

Maxim L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,6,,4.0,4/25/2015,"I had a great dining experience at this restaurant. It is a sports bar so it is loud and the wait times to be seated can be long in peak hours. But think about it: sports bars are loud and it is GOOD that the wait times are long, the wait times prove not only that the food is of good quality but also that people would wait just to eat here. That is actually a good thing. This means it is worth it. From my own view, this restaurant deserves a 4 star rating only because of the noise. I personally prefer restaurants a tad bit quieter but, again, I picked a sports bar which are generally louder than other restaurants. Otherwise, the experience was great. The decor was top notch, the food was delicious (by the way, you need to eat their pizookie), and our waiter was the best waiter I have literally ever had the pleasure of meeting. His name was Austin, and I believe he deserves a gold medal because the restaurant was horribly packed especially since it was a Friday night and he was still working with a smile on his face. He was kind and prompt with our order (especially mine because I was in a big rush). My food was ready and on the table in about 20 minutes. That's pretty good in my book. Plus, the taste is just WOW! Especially their burger and their pizookie. Seriously, try the pizookie. As you may have noticed I was impressed with the pizookie since I keep mentioning it. Try this place! But I wouldn't suggest it for romantic dinners, too much noise. If you are with a group of friends however? Oh yeah, go full out!

Food---Great Beer---Great...side note...anyplace that has enough confidence to put their own beers side by side with competitors, got my vote Pizookie---smaller than it used to be but still phenomenal Service---sucks First red flag---a lot of new faces Callin reservation (or whatever they call it)---frequently of late, I call in and when I get there, my name is not on the list.  The last time we called in the person on the phone said there was no wait so don't worry about.  Got there 20 minutes later...50 minute wait.  We went to PF Changs.  Bar--- usually has the best servers.  It is the most coveted positions as far as the wait staff goes.  Bar wait staff used to consistently get a 5 star from me...now at 2.5 stars.  Once in awhile...I get better service.  Used to never have to ask for things like beer refill, now I have to ask for silverware, refills,  some plates have warm food some have cold food...sometimes servers do not show up for 15 minutes or more. Main room servers---In the last 6 months...rarely, I mean rarely have I received good service here.  One of the servers made my wife and I  feel like we were putting him out just sitting in his section.  The pathetic part about this area is that unless BJ's has changed their policy, servers in this area only have 4 TABLES AT A TIME! Takeout---Last Saturday, 3:30pm (not the busiest time of day).  On hold for literally 8.5 minutes to place order.  Placed order and told them I was parked outside so just bring the food out when it is ready (curbside service).   20 minutes later I called to remind them about the fact that I was outside (3yr old asleep in car) and they said it was almost ready.  6 more minutes food arrives cold!  This is at 3:30-4pm not the craziest time of day for these people. In the end I blame the management.  I know they have at least one new manager.  Management sets the tone.  If it was not for the fact I have been eating at BJ's for the last 15 years...I would have stopped coming along time ago.  I have friend that had such poor service in the bar last week that he and his wife are never going back.  His experience was that it was 3:30pmish with a lot of wait staff around, almost empty restaurant , and the worst service ever.  Table didn't get cleared for 15minutes, 20 minutes before even receiving menus, food cold on arrival after waiting what seemed to be too long.

I raised my hand a few times when I saw her around, she never paid attention to us.  Last but not least, when I told the other waitress that Vanessa forgot our soup and salad, I was looking for an apology, but that didn't come across at all. Vanessa simply asked if we want her to pack our soup and salad to go? Hello! Soup and salad should come after appetizer & before entree, not as we're leaving the restaurant! If Vanessa served other tables the way she served ours, BJ's is in for lots of trouble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=620

Jana L.,"Campbell, CA",10,17,1,1.0,5/2/2011,"In Summary: It is really too bad because I enjoy the food and drinks at BJs locations all around.  However, this location has the WORST service of almost any place I have ever been.  If you want specifics, keep reading.  But basicly this place sucks and I think the entire management staff and at least a few servers need to be cleared out or at least go through bootcamp first. They should have their franchise license revoked as they are giving all BJs a bad name. Was ignored by our server, had to chase her down multiple times, asked for a manager that never came.  Probably spent at least and hour or more just waiting 20 min for drinks, another 20 to order food, and another 20 for the manager to come who never did when we asked to talk to him.  THEY SUCK!   If you absolutely must go there, though I recommend a boycott until it is under new management don't get a table with Pricilla....

Daina E.,"Tell City, IN",76,50,32,1.0,6/24/2013,"This was my first time eating at a BJ's, so I was pretty excited! I was just disappointed with the establishment when my friends and I left.  Went there for a friend's birthday dinner and the wait was expected being a Saturday night, that didn't bother me at all.  The food was good, had the potstickers, really good! However, the portion was too small, even for an appetizer. My issue was with the service! Our FIRST waiter came to take our drink order, and came back 10 minutes later. She than told us that we would have a new waiter, I'm thinking ok, she's getting off work, but she was still there for the next 2 hours we were there. It felt odd we were tossed to another waiter. This new waiter we got was lazy and sarcastic. He wouldn't come back when we asked for refills, over and over. The real kicker was my friend got one of those free pizookies for signing up with there mailing list, but had to wait for the email coupon to come. It wasn't coming to his email, and he signed up right there at the restaurant too. Our second waiter said he would go ask the manager for approval to do it anyways, but never came back. We had to flag down this waitress with a crumby attitude, she said no to the approve and said he would just have to wait for the email for next time. We finally flagged down our waiter, and he said he never got around to a manager, and we told him what his colleague said, he grabbed her over to ask about it and she YELLS at him in front of us saying she already told us no and blah blah... This woman was not a manager either. Our waiter, however, apologized for her behavior and said for the wait and the scene, that he would make it on the house for him. Which we appreciated.  Than when it came time for our checks. The snotty waitress printed our checks wrong and when i pointed out the error, she chuckles and says, ""well than you just don't have to pay more anymore."" Wow, sorry for being honest, and we payed with cash, I didn't get my change. I asked for my change from the waiter, he chuckled and said, ""you want your change?"", than walks over to the table next to them and ask if they have change because I i wanted my change! I started to bitch hella loudly! when he walked back with my change and final receipt, he apologized and told no ever asks for their change... wtf, who doesn't ask for their change!

It's not on the menu anymore, I don't know why. But they can still make it if you order it. All the other pizzas are crap. They're all made the same way, deep-dish style, but the blend of ingredients just don't do it for me. The BCP's ingredients compliment each other perfectly. I love how they threw corn in there to give it that slight saccharine flavor. And oh! The crust is just lovely.... crunchy, yet buttery and rich. I can't wait to have this pizza again. As for other menu items, I think they're all okay. Nothing on the menu has really wowed me yet. I haven't had them all, but many. The potstickers they have are pretty awesome. Desserts are.....ehhhh. I don't know why people are so crazy about the pazookie. It's ok. If they think so, they don't get out enough! I love the beer here. They have beers for the whole spectrum, and lucky for me, I'm a beer connoisseur. Most of the beers have a harmonious blend of flavors. Alot of them are very rich and subtle - which is perfect. For ladies, I would recommend the Very Berry Cider. That is always a hit when I order a carafe. It's just so tasty and bubbly. I swear you won't get enough! Service..... is a hit or miss. Thats that.

Sylvia D.,"San Jose, CA",33,206,845,3.0,12/29/2010,"BJ's used to be my favorite restaurant back when I was a naive college student and didn't know any better. I eventually figured out that BJ's wasn't super rad; it was the people and experiences I associated with it. I don't know if this has to do with my quest for happiness, but throughout the years, I tend to end up at BJ's during happy hour. HH is in the bar area only Monday-Friday from 3-7 pm and Saturdays-Sundays from 10pm-close. HH is pretty decent and includes $1 off draft beer, $1 off cocktails, $2 off appetizers and flat bread pizzas, and half-off mini pizzas. Half of their appetizer menu is filled with the usual HH suspects like cheese and bacon potato skins, fried calamari, sliders, and chicken wings. Nothing exciting. The other half of the appetizer menu is occupied by Asian/Asian fusion BS. I'll pass. I usually go for their mini pizzas ($5.19) because they're deep dish and unhealthier than their flat bread cousins. If you're new to BJ's microbrews or like drinking a little bit of everything, they offer a good beer taster options. You can go for one 5 oz. taster, four tasters of their lighter lagers and pale ales, four tasters of their amber ales and dark beers, or eight tasters of everything. Overall, their beer is okay. I've had better porters and their's has a bitter finish. Their raspberry cider is good. I'm also a fan of their handcrafted root beer for whenever I'm not in need of fermented wheat/yeast/hops. Overall, food and drink is just A-OK, hence the three stars. Maybe I would've given them another if they still served their beer in BJ's pint glasses. I need to swipe one for my brewery pint glass collection. Just kidding. The pint glass from the Oxnard BJ's mysteriously rolled into my bag.

Parking at this location is very hard to find since it's by the mall and the theater. If you have a hard time finding parking, park by Sears as there is usually parking there. It's around the corner from the main parking lot.  Anyways, the menu reminded me of what they have at the Cheesecake Factory. It's almost as extensive. One of the ladies in the group suggested that I try the pizza. I've never been here before so I trusted her opinion. I got the deep dish pizza with sausage and pepperoni, the mini size with a small Cesar salad. The pizza was terrible as was the salad. It was the worst Caesar salad that I've had in my entire life as it had barely any flavor and hardly any cheese on it. The service was good and the servers were nice and attentive, but the food sucked, at least what I got!  Someone in our group ordered one of their special pazookie deserts which is a giant cookie or cookies topped with a ton of ice cream. I did like the cookie. It was warm, gooey, and great. If it wasn't for that cookie desert and the good service, I would've given them two stars. Maybe their other dishes are better. Stay away from the pizza and Caesar salad.

We told our server how disappointed we were, but rather than expressing empathy for our dessert-starved souls, our server was very non-plussed about the situation and just served us some pizookies with chocolate ice cream, which did not make for a good dessert.  Mostly, I am surprised about how we were treated when we were simply telling the server a criticism about their customer care/service.

Sadly, the $25/medium price doesn't encourage me to eat there often. Enter BJ's! I'd heard that they put out a gf (gluten free) menu, so we had to go check it out. Not only do they have gf pizza, but it's reasonably priced (around $12 for 3 toppings for a decent sized pizza), AND it tastes even better than Amici's; you can't even tell that it's gf. I've had it a few times now and as a die hard pizza lover, I'd eat it all the time if I could.

Last night was not the case...  We were a party of 6 and I, along with the whole party, was fully disappointed with the whole experience.  Our server Danny B first of all did not even introduce himself to us or tell us his name, he completely dismissed us when we were asking for drinks, couldn't crack a smile and last but not least he must have completely forgotten about the soup I ordered because it took over 25 minutes to hit our table and i know they normally have fast ticket times. When i finally asked for the soup for the final time he acted as though i was TOTALLY inconveniencing him.  I just found the service extremely disappointing since i myself have worked as a server and am now a restaurant manager for The Elephant Bar, I know no one in my staff would act like that especially if they only have to serve 3 tables at a time.... never again will I go there.

The wait for the 10 of us was suprisingly not that long, it just took 8 mins to get seated.  The waitress took forever to order our drinks and seemed very rude when we asked to put our orders in. She first brought out some plates for the salad and I noticed that there was a piece of left over food on the side of the plate (it made me question what kind of  food BJ's was serving, that can cling on after the dish washer...). I asked the waitress kindly can she replace this plate because there's food on the side. She rudely responds ""well there's no charge for that!"", i know what your thinking, Garrett, your over reacting its just a bad joke, no my fellow yelpers she said it in the rudest way possible with a straight face. I guess when you don't have to work for a tip, the asshole comes out.  On a separate note I give BJ's knife and fork sandwiches a 4 out of 5. Its at a reasonable price around $12 and it can fill you up! I have tasted all of them and they all has not failed me yet. No BJ's dinner is complete with out a freshly oven baked cookie with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream on top served in a deep dish, the black mamba itself,  THE PIZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKIE!!!!!!!!! When I handed my v-card to BJ's famous pizookie for the first time, I cried myself to sleep 3 nights in a row reminiscing on how organismic the taste was and  I promised myself I would never settle for anything less.   The service killed it for me at San Jose's BJs, not even the pizookie can recover.

Al M.,"San Jose, CA",42,8,,4.0,2/27/2011,"First things first: this is NOT what you might think! I was as surprised as the next man (or woman!) to see an establishment so overtly advertising BJs, and so one day I decided to go in and get one for myself. Why not, right? Disappointingly though, this is actually a Restaurant and Brewhouse, and the letters 'BJ' do in fact refer to their respective letters of the alphabet. However, once you settle down at one of their many tables or stools conveniently located within the Restaurant and Brewhouse itself, you realize things could be worse. Variously, kind people offer beverages and even eats (food), bringing them to you shortly after you have asked for them, often correctly remembering your original request. Try the whiskey with some diet pepsi - a unique slant on a popular cocktail. To conclude, this place is a delight for the taste buds, but may need to rethink its misleading marketing to be a true contender for greatness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=680

Topped with roasted turkey, Applewood smoked bacon, feta cheese, tomatoes and avocado. The menu has a picture of a lovely looking salad.  My salad was iceberg lettuce - no romaine. No croutons. A couple cubes of turkey. A couple scraps of bacon.  It was a sorry looking salad. I couldn't let this go - I've seen better salads come out of Subway.

One time all we ordered was a pizza and while the pizza they gave us was tasty it was not even close to what we ordered. They tend to leave out items that you selected and paid for (like my 2 year old's side dioshes).  It's a nice place to go out with friends for happy hour but bottom line is don't have your expectatinos too high, and check your food before leaving if you use take-out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=740
Connie C.,"Belmont, CA",5000,1539,1424,4.0,10/27/2009,"BJ's brings back lots of memories of my UCLA days, when BJ's was still brand new and in only a few SoCal locations. It was always our favorite spot to hit up for pizza to-go while waiting in line for opening night movies at the FOX Theater, or late-night grub after a long day of classes. While locations have multiplied since then, I still do love me a slice of their deep dish pizza.  This BJ's is the closest to my house, and while parking is horrible at Oakridge, and there's almost always a wait, at least you've got a huge bar to hang out at, and I can always make a quick run to F21. The staff here is very friendly, and service is excellent.  Their handcrafted beers are pretty good. I like my beers pale, so I prefer their Brewhouse Blonde. We had a taste of their Pumpkin Ale last night, which is a seasonal beer, but I wasn't a big fan.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and there's something for everyone. However, I always stick with my fave: Buffalo Chicken Pizza. Like the menu says, it's for Buffalo Chicken Wing lovers! I love the toppings, and the ranch dressing and buffalo sauce on the pizza is just so yummy.  I used to love the Pizookies, but now that I'm with a guy who bakes cookies better than anyone else, I'd rather have a homemade one! I think they still do a complimentary Pizookie on your birthday, so take advantage of that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=740

If you have an allergy, there's an allergy menu that can help you order, but don't feel restricted to just those items because the servers are normally more than happy to adjust some of the other dishes to fit what you can eat.

Once again the food is decent. The salads always have too much dressing (remember to ask for it on the side), Potato is as big as your head but I mean who pays $8 or more for that size of a potato. Might as well go to Sweet Tomatoes, pay the same amount and eat unlimited potatoes and salad bar. The chardonnay shrimp pasta is tasty but its very oily.  Lots of people raves about BJ's pizza but I just think its decent. It's not too tasty and its usually soft. I need my pizza crunchy.

Yeah.  First impressions, weren't that great, as she snuck up on us trying not to interrupt our menu reading, we felt like wild animals being attacked!  Immediate defense, we hated our server.  It only took us ten seconds to fall in LOVE with her.  Sorry for anyone who got a crappy server tonight, ours rocked our socks!  She was patient, personable, funny, thoughtful and had one heck of a memory.   Did everything by the book when it comes to table tap time (the time we had to wait for her before she greeted us) refilling our drinks, and suggestions.  She even apologized for something that was clearly not her fault!!!   WARNING:  At the night's end, I approached Ashley's manager about her amazingness, only to discover there are apparently  3+ other Ashley's!  So don't be fooled, our Ashley is a college student, studying nursing.... she has a hell of a head on her shoulders and I think she should be running the place.   Time out... I know what your thinking... ""She's probably your friend"". Wrong, don't know her, but I like her.  And I like to write my opinions that's why I'm yelping, and that's why your reading my opinion!

I envy those who have her as a server on a good night!   2.  Why go for a hard sell when you can win with a soft one?  Rather than asking "" would you like soup or salad with that"", Ashley warned us that our our meal would be enough without the side, and suggested that we go with the desert instead.  Yummy Pazookie!!!! Much better than salad any-day!  *Go for the Pazookie trio, and sample some different flavors!!! Note: we are a couple of demanding, impatient, picky, and outspoken food critic types, and she gets 5 stars.  The restaurant on the other hand, was pretty awesome, not as awesome as the server, but alright.  Food was great, but the majority of the staff seemed a bit off their game; dropping food, forgetting things, etc.  I also have a problem with the fact that all the servers looked identical!  White, brunettes... just different shapes and sizes.  Short, tall, skinny, whatever... just splitting images of the same person at different phases of life or something...

Expect a long wait if you arrive later than 6pm unless you just want to grab a drink at the bar. Even the bar is packed with people. They have some good selections of their home-brewed beers. The food is okay. Nothing fancy really. I got their grilled chicken sandwich. It was okay. I think it needed a bit more kick to it. I had their cajun pasta. The chicken was a bit bland to me. I think it needed more seasoning. Expect a wait even if you have reservations. We had to wait another 40 minutes to get our table. (for a birthday party of 20-30). The waiter/waitress is a hit or miss. You get the nice/mean ones. There's no actual consistency. They are famous for their pizookie. You get a free pizookie on your birthday. I'm not much of a sweets person but I actually think it's pretty good. It's basically a big fresh cookie with various ice-cream flavors. You can also pick your cookie flavor too.

Lincoln D.,"Milpitas, CA",0,52,,1.0,2/26/2012,I came here with a buddy on a Sunday for lunch. I ordered their chicken fried steak and it took a while for the order to come out.

Zerrilyn P.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",222,294,663,3.0,8/5/2012,"Came here today for brunch with my bf and brother since they said their tummies were growling haha... The weather was just right, so I asked if we could be seated outside. The menu is pretty wide--everything looked so good, but just having read the calories of each food was pretty intimidating, luckily I found something from the brunch menu that was just a little over 500 calories (still sounds loaded I know, but definately not compared to the 4 digit food items you'll see on the menu haha) For appetizers, my bro and bf ordered the stuffed mushrooms and fried calamari: -Stuffed mushrooms--I only had one, and wasn't really impressed with it--the flavors of the stuffing and mushroom itself didn't blend together--you don't get that simultaneous taste of the stuffing AND the mushroom..it's more like..you taste the stuffing...and THEN the mushroom...hope that makes sense... -Fried calamari--unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with this either--just breaded and fried squid was all it was--no special seasons on it or anything--texture was inconsistent--and top of that...we found a strand of hair on one of the lemon wedges...ewwwww....I told the waiter, and came back with a new plate of lemon wedges...not his fault that there was hair on it, but he should have noticed it on there...clearly visible...I didn't harangue the guy since he had been so nice and attentive to us...he even made a joke about the hair by saying,"" We charge extra for hair on food."" The three of us were just like,""Sorry, what'd you say?"" only because we didn't hear what he said the first time around haha... Took awhile for our entrees to come, but the appetizers were enough to hold us over for just a bit longer...our waiter was so nice to come up to us every so often to update us on our food...I'm guessing the crowds were growing from the inside...I don't know... Anyways, for entrees: -I ordered the baked italian omelette with wheat toast--it's three scrambled eggs with italian sausage,tomatoes,onions,and mushrooms, with a side of wheat toast and hash? (I think that's what it's called)--the guy forgot to bring me some jam with my toast and apologized, and again I didn't nag at him for that b/c I too, forgot to even ask for it...I was fine with eating the toast by itself anyway haha -My bf ordered the fried chicken--laid on a bed of mashed potatoes and corn--from what he said he liked it -Broski orderd the bacon cheeseburger with thin fries--monster burger I tell you...greasy as hell just by the look of it--I'm sure he liked it since he killed it all lol Overall experience at this BJ's was good, just minus two stars for the hair thing and the wait time between appetizer to entree... I've eaten at BJ's at the San Bruno place--don't remember what I've ordered from there since it's been so long since I've eaten there...but the pizookie is always memorable...I've tried all flavors...and all were delish--especially with the ice cream on top...mmm...now I suddenly have a craving for this dessert :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=760

It features a generous assortment of four of BJ's most popular appetizers: Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls. around $15-18 They spilt the plates so everything was even for two people expect for the spinach and artichoke dip but they did give us two spoon.  really like  4 avocado egg rolls and the dipping sauce it come with. tasted really nice and creamy the spinach and artichoke dip- you can actually see the chunk of artichoke which my friend likes and the different color tortilla chips  4 mozzarella sticks come with Mariana sauce and the 4  santa fe spring rolls had a nice corn and pepper taste to it with a dipping sauce i got PIRANHA® PALE ALE CHILI CHEESEBURGER* An 8 oz. Angus burger served open-faced, smothered with Piranha® Pale Ale chili, jack and cheddar cheeses and topped with onion strings alongside sliced tomatoes and pickles. Served with wedge-cut seasoned fries. about $10 i got mine well done. it was a little brunt in some place but still pretty good. i had two slice of bread underneath everything. which i dont really get cuz it is a open-faced burger. after a while didnt even eat the bread. just ate the meat and chili-cheese. i like the wedge fries cuz it a thick cut with the skin on which i like. better then the kfc ones. and some of my chili cheese went onto the fries. tram got ANGUS POT ROAST SANDWICH Tender Angus beef pot roast slices are served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll and topped with white cheddar mashed potatoes and mushroom brown gravy. Served with oven roasted vegetables. about $10 she like the Cheddar mash potatoes but the meat remember me of a Salisbury stake with the meat and mushrooms on top. she said the sauce/ gravy was a little too strong to her.  and for dessert BJ'S FAMOUS PIZOOKIE® You're never too old to enjoy our freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Peanut Butter around $6-8 'they have different flavors like triple chocolate and chocolate chuck but we got strawberry. the pizookie was really good warm and the ice cream on top made it cool down but it was good. we were gonna do a trio but was too full the service was good until we switch services cuz it was now dinner time. but it got crowded around dinner time so i will forgive him for that. the two servers did refill our water on a regular basic and was patience with us when we didnt know wat we wanted to order right away.  total around $46 (includes tax) without soda, we got some water and some sparkling water from target instead",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=760

Matt K.,"San Jose, CA",3,10,,4.0,2/17/2010,"BJ's is a great place to eat! I often compare it to an upscale Chili's. Their food selection is very wide and the majority of it is very good!  Although many reviewers have had problems with wait times, I have never experienced more than a five minute wait. The waiters/waitresses are mostly attentive and always very nice. Only one time have I had a slow waitress. Otherwise, they are very attentive and quick.  The food is pretty good, like I said before, an upscale Chili's. Their menu is quite diverse, going from pasta, to barbecue, to seafood. The food is never spectacular or mind blowing, but they do a good job. The food can be a bit bland, but still very tasty, and they have huge portion sizes. I can definitely count on taking home leftovers every time I eat here for dinner. (Their lunch portions are much smaller and rarely do I have leftovers.) Overall, I would give the entrees 3 stars.  The Pazookie is a whole other story! It deserves 5 stars. A warm cookie served with ice cream. The cookie is always soft and moist and it very good. I would even consider coming here just for the pookie for dessert.  Overall, the atmosphere is nice and the food is pretty good.

Ok hate is a strong word...but I wasn't impressed. It actually made me a little sick to my stomach. Maybe it's partially my fault I'm not a fan of Chicago style pizza anyhow. But this we ordered a peperoni, artichoke, olive and ham pizza and it wasn't cooked all the way through. =( It was pretty doughy and then for some strange reason there was feta cheese on it...EW. The gyoza were decent though. And honestly the appetizers have been pretty good that I've had in the past. I really just didn't enjoy the pizza. It tastes greasy, heavy and needed to cook more. I seriously felt like i had a rock on my stomach when I was done and I only had a piece and a half.  Service also wasn't very good.

We sat at a booth and the waiter looked at us and didn't approach our table. After about sitting down for twenty minutes, still no service. We didn't even get a glass of water. At that point I was embarrassed since I was on a date, maybe the waiter didn't care for a gay couple, I don't know.

Emiko T.,"New York, NY",279,329,100,5.0,5/28/2011,"I've been coming here for years and I must have never written a review about this place because I just take it for granted. Like a favorite pair of jeans that you don't expect to wear out on you because they've been so loyal. ""I'll do write something next time,"" I tell myself. ""For sure I'll review my stellar experience when I get home,"" I often repeat. But my BJ'S Yelp review cannot contain itself anymore and all due to the little piece of ecstasy called the red velvet pizookie. And because it's the only thing on my mind right now I'm starting backwards with dessert. After all...why would you go to BJ's if not FOR the pizookie? It's their gimmick and it works like a charm. No matter if your button is exploding and your pants are suffocating your sides like a boa constrictor, you're always going to order the pizookie. Up until tonight I thought the best and most indulgent pizookie they had was their triple chocolate chip (complete with a Ghiradelli chocolate square and the only one with chocolate ice cream). However, they've blessed the menu with a new red velvet pizookie cookie, and as my beautiful date so aptly said, ""This is what Hawaii tastes like."" She took the words right out of my mouth as I stuffed my own with a big chunk of red velvet and white chocolate chips and melted vanilla ice cream. Holy cow you've never tasted anything so luscious. We were actually angry with ourselves that we only got HALF a red velvet because we ordered a split pizookie with a chocolate chip cookie--such fools we were, but never again. We've found our one true dessert calling and we're never going back. It's like finally finding the love of your life, being smitten at first sight/bite, and you're hooked. The taste lingers and it's calling me back. I figure it'll take me another five workouts to successfully undo the damage from that pizookie before I return.  To comment on the rest of the food, I'd say just as a restaurant in general, BJ's is on par with Cheesecake Factory. It's as if they share the same motto--pile the food on the plate, make it look like a good deal then charge them juuussst enough for them to say ""ouch"" but don't hurt 'em too bad because they need to keep coming back. And that's usually what ends up happening. You define your indulgence as worthwhile and you inevitably go back for more of the same--a kind of fun, very predictable menu with a pseudo-gourmet flair that will fill you up for the next two days. BJ's likes to claim they do deep-dish pizza but if anyone's really dug their way into a real deep dish (Chicago) style pizza will know that BJ's version is like a thin-crust. But hey, I must say they got a great thing going with their Great White pizza. If you try any of their pizzas once, I recommend that one. If you've got a hankering for some cheese and sour cream drenched goodness you should also share the nachos with someone who has a bigger appetite than a quarterback, but if that quarterback happens to be you, then by all means, eat the whole plate of nachos. They're pretty addictive and have got this chili bean sauce thing going on at the bottom of the pile. So if you search for that within the mountain of chips, you've got a pretty tasty combination.  Also, if you're a mojito-lovin', mixed drinks kind of person I highly recommend their Wildberry Mojito which is actually a new drink. Delicious, refreshing, just enough sweetness without being sugary. I ordered two, so, I guess it was pretty damn good. Any other day the Berry Burst cider is awesome. (And if you happen to be a beer fundamentalist by now you are probably scoffing and scrolling your way away from my review after reading about cider, but to each his own. But you seriously don't know what you're missing out on).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=780
Savannah C.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,,1.0,9/3/2013,"We kept telling ourselves about the passed 7 times we would never come back here.  I have a million stories I could tell.... all due to the terrible customer service. Every time we have gone something always goes wrong.  Two out of the passed 7 times a manager has came to apologize to us without us even complaining! That's when you know you have messed up. Appetizers are brought out after entrees, food still cold, water cups never filled, the list goes on and on. The last visit was the icing on the cake. They pointed at where we were supposed to sit, didnt walk us. Table still had dishes and the bill/tip from previous people. They picked the dishes up and never wiped the table. There were crumbs all over which we ended up wiping down ourselves. I ordered a soup which never came out. When entrees came out 40 minutes later (we had a party of 4 and went on a Sunday night) I told the waitress the soup never came out and I didn't want it anymore. She came to check on us when we were almost finished eating and said she's going on a break here is your new waitress. When we got the bill the soup was still on there and I told the waitress to please take it off because I never received the soup. She said she wasnt our original waitress when the food was being ordered so we would have to wait for the other one to come back. I told her I'm not going to sit here and wait for the other waitress to come back that's ridiculous. She ended up just removing it herself that was that. I couldn't believe she told me that I would have to wait.... Best believe we didn't leave a tip.

I love how the waiter and waitress base their services and mood on how they're feeling that day or even better if they are having a bad day.. you will see it and of course they will see it on the tip if you are getting bad service.  Bj's food are not great, the prices are dead on for their food and the wait is super fantastic i love it.. not really. If you're coming here for dinner you're in for a hand full. Underage kids with their posse, raging angry mothers with their loud mouth kids and of course we cant' forget the tough guys with his groupy going to get a pitcher or four.  They have a good variety on the menu so if you don't like stuffing your face with a pizza try their fish tacos or their salads. I'm not sure what's healthier but feel free to try their huge menu of oh so tasty stuff.

They get four stars on customer service:  While we were waiting they passed out mini slices of cheese pizza which I thought was cool.

When we first started coming her everything was excellent! The service was awesome and food tasted great! Up until recently, I would say the past could of months there service went completely down hill. They got a new manager a short mexican guy who obviously does not care about the restaurant or its employees. We had two bad experiences since new management came on board. First time: I order a pasta and my boyfriend ordered a burger. The pasta came out first, of course i was going to wait til his burger came out, its a burger how long could it possibly take. I swear it took 8-10 minutes for the burger to come out! My plate was completely cold and to top it off it was the wrong burger! This was not on a busy night, so NO excuse could make this situation right. When i told the waitress she became completely defensive and said that she only puts in the orders its up to the cooks to get the order right! I ask to speak to the manager and she said ""Hes too busy"" and walked away. My boyfriend immediately got mad and left $15 enough for my plate and our two Cokes.  Second Time:  It took a long time for our waiter to come to our table to get our order. Where we were sitting the manager was directly kiddy corner from us talking to our waiter about the baseball game that was on TV. Me and my boyfriend came back for a Sunday lunch after shopping. I got a soup and salad combo and he got a sandwich. after he took our order it was not a long wait from our food. By the time we got our food, my boyfriend was ready for refill on his soda. The manager and our waiter were talking again. My boyfriend put his hand up and made eye contact with the waiter to come over. The waiter then turn his back on us and continued talking to the manager!! I couldn't believe how rude he was being and the manager did not say anything to him! I told my boyfriend that i would share my drink with him and it will just come out of his tip!(We always tip really good atleast 20% if service is excellent we tip 25% my mom was a waitress her whole life and she taught me to always tip well) so we done with our food. about 5 minutes went by and my boyfriend seen our waiter and once again signaled for him to come over. he went straight to the bar. another 5-10 minutes went by and we are just sitting there! i become extremely anger and walked straight up to the manager and said we have not seen our waiter for nearly 15 minutes. He tells us that our waiter was off work 20 minutes ago. and that he would get the bill! what a douche!! and the manager did not see a problem with it! We will not be going back!!

The only downside of this place is that the outdoor covered area is non-smoking, so you have to go all the way outside to smoke and then you're directly in front of the entry way of the mall, which is an odd place to direct smokers too in my opinion.

The first few times I had this drink I fell in love . And I regret ordering anything other than the Double berry ( not that the other drinks aren't great) I'm just a creature of habit and once I find something I really like I stick with it . Now this past week I visited my closet location twice , both times ordering a double berry . On my first visit it seemed off but I didn't think much of it . And then again on my second visit it didn't seem quite right . Again I over looked it and thought maybe it's just my imagination . Now on Thursday I was in San Jose for a comedy event and went to BJs for dinner in Oakridge . I ordered a double berry as usual , and was definitely disappointed .

I did happen to try the pizza but I don't remember what the exact topping was. As for myself, I got a Hefeweizen beer, chips and salsa, calamari(new item), and shared a chocolate chip Pizookie. The Chips and Salsa were good, as always. Their new menu item, calamari, was actually pretty good. The batter that they fried the calamari had a nice crunchy texture to it and the sauces they provided were satisfying but nothing great(white and red sauce). The chocolate chip pizookie was awesome too. The cookie was nice and warm along with the contrast of some cold ass vanilla ice cream... YUM.

NOT OK!!! i mean, i love sausage. just not TOGETHER with cookie AND ice cream.  poking around the pizzokie, i saw other pieces of sausage sticking out of the cookie dough. hm. called the waitress who called the manager over, and we all poked at the pizzokie and concur that indeed, this pizzokie had sausage. yes, they promptly comped my dessert and rushed another order of non-meat pizzokie to my table. it could've been worse if the pizzokie was intended for vegetarians. but apparently the kitchen accidentally reused the sausage scoop to scoop the cookie dough. OOPS. well i wasn't offended. :) makes for great stories, you can't make this up. i want to give this a 3.5 stars. for what it's worth, it's a decent, causal hangout where you can get GOOD BEER and a decent meal while watching hockey on TV, so that bumps this up 0.5 stars. the pizzokie is a must have. i know some guy friends who are reduced to having salads and appertizers so they can save room for the pizzokie. so manly. *wink*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=840

The wait is always long on the weekends (45 minutes-1hr) and you can only get a reservation if your party is 10 or larger. The food is consistently tasty and delicious though! Also, it is usually fast and the servers are quick.  The prices are decent as well. I believe lunch ranges from $6-15 and dinner probably ranges from $9-20. The most expensive thing is like NY steak or something (which is good). The best thing on the menu would probably have to be the PIZOOKIE!  My favorite would probably be the chocolate chip one! Mmm! Things that I would recommend; Jambalaya, Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Pizza (Bj's Works), Broccoli Chicken Pasta, Big Potatoes, Broccoli Cheddar soup (not too cheesy)! All these dishes are SO SO SO tasty and flavorful. AND OF COURSE, I definitely with out a doubt recommend the PIZOOKIE. It's simply amazing. Other things that are pretty good are their sandwiches, burgers, chicken strips, chili cheese fries, and the spinach dip is pretty good as well. The decor and atmosphere of this place is good.

Then we waited 20 minutes for a sign of a human in the area. No Water, no cocktails, no nothing. Not even a wink in our direction - and that goes for the whole area we were seated in - not just us. You could hear crickets in the area. Hubby got up and went to the host table and asked for someone to serve us. They were apologetic, but again - another 5 min waiting. Since we had a waitress, we ordered drinks and food at the same time. Good thing we did because we didn't see the waitress again for another 20 min for her check-in 'how's your food'.  Once we got our food, another waiter brought us our food and left.... we were without utensils - nice. Hubby went to the server station to ask for utensils and HE came back with them - not a waiter/waitress/etc.  The same pattern continued until we asked for our bill. We did get a random dude in khakis and a blue shirt come and 'apologize' really half -a$$ed about the service.

Sara H.,"San Jose, CA",13,52,12,2.0,1/29/2009,I was so disappointed with this visit to BJ's. I've been there several times in the past and never had anything to complain about. Kyle and I went last night (Wednesday) around 6pm ish. The restaurant was full enough that we had about a 10 minute wait for a table. When we got seated our server was there quickly and took our beer order. When she came back we ordered the appetizer and was assured even though they were busy the food usually comes quickly. The  beer was good and reasonably priced. $4.75 for a pint.  We were sitting enjoying our beer when next thing we knew our entree's were there. What happened to the appetizer?? We asked our server and she said she would go check on it. By the time she got back we were halfway thru our dinner. I was disappointed when the final check came and they didn't offer a discount or take the appetizer off our bill even though it was so late.  The entree's were just ok. I had the BJ's cheeseburger and that suited me fine. Didn't realize it came with thousand island so watch out if you don't like it. Kyle ordered the chicken pasta and was not happy with it. It was dry and flavorless and the chicken was overdone. The server said she would've taken it back to put more sauce on had we mentioned it to her.  Overall it was a so-so experience. I've had better meals there in the past. Not sure if I can convince Kyle to give it another try. We wont be going back anytime soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=840
Teresa N.,"San Jose, CA",161,274,126,3.0,3/6/2009,"I think BJs is a good place to go to for a casual lunch or dinner with friends, but there isn't anything really special about the food here (except for the pizookie!), or maybe it's just cos I can't drink yet, cos I see many people order the beer sampler when dining here. I usually like Bjs at the other locations I've been to, but I felt like the service here is a bit sub-par compared to the other ones I've been to. Some co-workers and I went here for a birthday dinner, and we were seated on time according to the reservation, so I was really happy about that. After we were seated and our orders were placed (we were seated outside with that patio thing around us), we were just talking and what not, and the waitress servicing the table behind us spoke very loudly about how she dated this guy 6 years ago who broke up with her cos of world of warcraft. HAHAHA. ok, not only was this unneccessary, but it was also very awkward. Our table was just kinda like O__O wtf? hella weird. good thing her shift was over or something cos we didnt see her for the rest of the night. When we finished up dinner and got the check... our waitress took FOREVER to come get it again. Our table was like helloo... uhh dont you want your money? We even had to tell the other waitress to go get OUR waitress to pick up her check. So... for ok food, and good beer (i woudlnt know), I guess BJs is good. You might wanna try out the other locations though... unless you want to meet the waitress who got dumped over WoW...

Sarah M.,"Manteca, CA",218,263,420,3.0,3/1/2011,"I am not really a big fan of big chain restaurants. There is nothing really special about them and they tend to lose the personalization that you get with family/privately owned restaurants. They are a big corporation and they are totally cool with serving crappy to mediocre food at really inflated prices. I really do prefer smaller restaurants but we ended up eating here tonight with some friends. I have been to BJ's in various locations in the past and it has not been that spectacular. I also feel like with these chain restaurants service varies by location and it is hit or miss. It is really hard to get any consistency whatsoever. I could come here tomorrow and get a 5 star experience or I could visit another location and get a one star experience. You just never know. However, since I have discovered yelp I feel like it is my duty to report my experiences at all of the places I visit. So here it goes.  This visit is very much like the rest average at best. Our friends were running a little late so my husband and I ordered some drinks and chips and salsa as an appetizer. These arrived in a timely fashion. The chips and salsa was not that great. It was really bland and blah so I really didn't eat that much of it. About 20 minutes pass and our friends finally make it. They order their drinks and ask for some time to look over the menu. After that our waitress seemed to disappear. About 25 minutes passed before she surfaced again and we were all long ready to order by then. For that 25 minute period I was stuck with an empty glass and nasty chips and salsa. She took our orders and brought out refills. She would stop by sporadically to refill our drinks but our food took forever. Another 30 minutes passed before we received our food which was very annoying and resulted in another 30 minutes of me being stuck with a growling stomach and nasty chips and salsa, at least I had a full glass. I got the grilled shrimp tacos and they were mediocre at best. My husband got the pulled pork sandwich and he seemed to enjoy it. Our waitress was very nice and attentive and I can surely appreciate that with customer service the way it is today. Like I said before nothing really spectacular or memorable.  Overall, I would rate the experience average. Our waitress stayed on top of our refills with the exception of her 25 minute disappearance and the food was ok at least. (Except the chips and salsa.) Not my favorite place to go but a great place to go with friends. With groups chain restaurants seem to be the better choice most of the time. Diverse menu and familiar location puts everyone at ease. There is something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=860
Michelle P.,"San Jose, CA",2,3,2,1.0,1/21/2013,I usually have no problems with this bj but for some reason today the service was ridiculous. We ordered 2 chicken parm and one spaghetti dish and wasn't told till 20 minutes later that their was no more chicken breast. Like im pretty sure you ran out way before so you couldve saved us the time and told us when we ordered. 30 minutes passes and we finally get our food. What really ticked me off more was that the spaghetti dish was just warm and not steaming hot like the others. It's obvious they let that dish sit there for 20 minutes while making the last two orders. You'd think theyd put our orders in the front to make first since one pasta dish was already done but guess not. On top of that one of the plates was missing garlic bread like how can you not notice there's no bread on a plate when there's two plates that have it?!!!? And to top it off the garlic bread was hard! Could've knocked someone's head off! we literally waited longer than we ate!

Jenni E.,"San Jose, CA",104,58,7,3.0,11/11/2011,"Stopped in today for a quick lunch with my parents after a couple hours of shopping.  We were seated quickly, which was a nice change.  Usually, BJ's is jam-packed and it's slow getting a table.  But for once, the restaurant was not completely full. All three of us ordered the soup/salad lunch.  Service was slow, and it took about 10 minutes just to get our salads.  Then, about 5 minutes later, our waiter brought 2 bowls of soup (it was the tortilla soup...yum!).  We kept waiting for the third bowl to show up...and wondered where our spoons were.  Another 5+ minutes went by and I saw our server race by, so got his attention.  He looked dumbfounded that we were missing a soup and had no spoons.  He quickly went to get our soup, but brought back the wrong kind.  But at least we did get our spoons, however by now the first two soups were no longer very hot.  I will say that both of the soups were fabulous. My salad was just the house salad.  Not all that impressive as it was mostly clumps of iceberg lettuce, a couple small tomato slices and weak tasting dressing.  My parents both got the Cesar salad, which they said was really good. I'm not sure what went wrong here.  Maybe the kitchen was giving our server the wrong food.  But I think he should have caught the mistakes before they got to our table.  And simple things like spoons for soup...should not have had to ask. We go to BJ's every couple of months, and this particular visit was the worst.  But I will go back, assuming this is just a one time bad visit.

Cookie baked on the bottom and topped with a large scoop of ice cream on top. Yummay!!!  Anyway, this place is a lot like Chili's and Applebee's but they serve deep dish pizzas which isn't half bad. If I wasn't in the mood for salad, my boyfriend and I will order the buffalo chicken pizza with a side of blue cheese/ranch dressing and chicken fettucine alfredo. Pizza itselfnot too spicy but tangy which gives the pizza a good richness to it. The pastahmmmnothing too spectacular. Tastes the same. Nothing new to bring to the table. This is a brewery, so give their beer a try. You can sample each one off the menu.  There's nothing special about how the place looks, just a family-style (homey-feel) restaurant. This and the Cupertino location are always packed, so come early around 6pm for dinner OR a late lunch around 1pm-2pm. If you plan to make reservations, expect to have at least HALF of your party to be there on time or else you'd have to wait because they need to accommodate others that are waiting for a table. This place is good for birthday, graduation, or for whatever occassion it may   just seats a large group.  Their servicedepends on the day that you come. Varies if the restaurant is busy and they're short on staff. They really do think about their customers, so cut them a break. It's a lot harder for Chili's and Applebee's to seat a large party on such short notice for 35+....so I had my birthday at BJ's. Both of the waitresses were friendly and kind.

Alishea A.,"San Jose, CA",21,1,1,2.0,8/13/2014,"So I thought getting my car towed, being extremely late to work and just having the worst day ever was the worst my day was ever going to get...WRONG! It is my boyfriend's birthday so I decided to forget all about my horrible day and treat him to dinner at BJ's. Now usually I get excellent customer service and get our food fairly quick, not today. Our server Corina came by and she seemed nice, took our orders and said she'd return with our drinks. Like 5 minutes go by and I start getting really thirsty wondering when my drink is coming, no big deal they finally come. Now again with the waiting game this time about 20 minutes go by until our food comes, way longer than usual but hey they might be busy....instant letdown as soon as the food hits the table. My bf ordered a chicken TORTILLA soup only to see no TORTILLA Strips, no avocado just plain chicken soup. Next, he ordered Wedge cut fries with his burger and guess what he got? THIN cut fries. Also I specifically asked for 3 sides of ranch before the food arrived, do you think it got delivered? No. At this point we both are very annoyed I mean after all its his birthday and they messed up only on his order! Seriously? He tells her everything that was wrong. She returns with the same soup he had already eaten some of and adds it to a bowl of tortilla strips & avocado. Is it not common sense to serve a fresh new soup since it was not done properly the first time..obviously not. Now it's refill time and that takes about 10 more minutes, I see our server walking around the ailes offering to refill everyone's waters. um hello where's our drinks you said you'd be back with 10 minutes ago? She gets to our table and says ""can I get you guys anything?"" Our drinks would be nice! Her response ""what drinks?"" Are you fucking serious right now! After telling her what we were drinking she said "" oh yeah that's my bad""and walks away................how much slower and forgetful can you be?! She obviously didn't care for her tip with the way she portrayed her service. Needless to say my boyfriend's birthday dinner was an embarrassment and BJ's just ruined my night even more. Hopefully they train their employees to move quicker while getting the damn order correct.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=920

Their portions are huge too so you'll have enough leftovers for another meal or two. They're almost always busy so you know the food is good. I have one complaint. I came here with my mom and sister. We ordered appetizers and entrees, which came with side salads. The appetizers came quickly. But then the salads came just a few minutes after the appetizers, and then the entrees came another few minutes later. We got everything almost all at once and barely had enough space on our table.

Waterman H.,"Berkeley, CA",0,17,,4.0,2/7/2010,"WATER Service: Water service is everything. I will usually get down to the bottom of my glass at Bj's before it gets filled up.

When we finally sat down, the waitress was really attentive, and we never waited long for what we ordered.  She got everything perfectly - I asked for things to be removed from my salad, and it came out great.  The beer was good, the pizza is deep dish and kind of like pizza hut, but it tasted good, the appetizers we had - avocado egg rolls, bruschetta and spinach/artichoke deep - were all great.   BTW - they only take up to 6 credit cards if your party is going dutch.

Berg W.,"Sacramento, CA",94,298,1,3.0,4/30/2008,"BJ's is the perfect model of corporate inefficiency. You know how these busy places give the buzzers to their guests now. Well, there comes a time, when that's not really necessary. When there is one person waiting one minute for a table, you don't need to bother with the buzzer. The hostess could simply say, ""You're table is ready."" So when there was not a wait, the hostess entered our name in the computer, programmed our buzzer, gave that to us. I imagine she let the computer know our table was ready, which activated the buzzer. We took the buzzer back to her, and she directed us to our host, who then seated us. All of this happened in like 2 minutes. Another example of technology making things a lot more complicated then they have to be. BJ's makes perhaps the greasiest pizza on the planet. I'm not one to shy from a slice at Pizza My Heart dripping with grease, but BJ's takes it a little too far. To be honest I came here with a grease craving. I ordered the avocado egg rolls. Whoa. Incredibly rich. Avocado and cream cheese deep fried. Then I split a small BJ's Favorite deep dish with my GF. It looked kinda small, but there was a heck of a lot of grease packed into that little package. The crust was a like a grease soaked dough ball topped with extra grease. It tasted pretty good, but I felt like I weighed 500 lbs afterward. Their desserts are equally over-the-top. Just because you can make a pizza-sized cookie and sell it to people doesn't mean you should. Nobody really needs to eat that after all the grease they already had. We were awarded a free dessert after our server neglected to bring me my beer until after the food was finished. Although I couldn't really eat it, I had to accept it, and it was the sad finish to a greasy nightmare. I ate about two bites and waddled my bloated ass out of there. The beer was less than notable. I tried the porter, which was pretty good, but the red was boring and poorly crafted. Service was pedestrian...typical corporate chain service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=940

We went on a Friday night around 6pm (big mistake) and saw the oodles of people waiting for a table, so we headed to the bar, to hunt for a table. First words of advice: Be aggressive and if you see someone with a tab or empty plates of food, kindly ask them if they will be leaving soon and most will be kind and obliging.  This BJ's bar area is pretty small compared to the one in Vacaville, so I felt like I was being a bit intrusive on others standing there in the middle of the bar next to someone's table waiting for someone to leave. But, in the end our patience and kindness and aggressivness got us a table. Words of caution: Do not order the appetizer thin crust pizzas! They are disgusting! I can make better pizzas with a tortilla in my microwave! Instead order a real pizza, which is worth the wait.

Allison R.,"Santa Clara, CA",49,161,52,4.0,7/25/2010,"Yay for gluten free pizza!!!! I'd heard BJ's introduced it a couple of months ago, but just got around to going last night (their GF menu isn't on their website, but the pizza is listed on the regular menu, and there are a couple other GF items available as well). Their GF pizza is delicious!! The crust was definitely one of the better crusts I've had. It was cooked perfectly and the price was much better than some places I've been to. I believe it was $8.95 for a cheese pizza, and then the cost went up as you added on the toppings. I got Italian sausage, roasted garlic, roasted peppers, and cilantro, and it came to $12.95 (WAY better that the $25 I've spent at some other restaurants that serve GF pizza).  The minus one star is because I'd heard they also have Redbridge GF beer, so I was very excited to be able to have pizza and a beer when I went out with my friends. But much to my dismay, they were out :( It is nice to know that a brewery is willing to carry a beer made by another company for dietary needs though. I did decide to try their GF berry cider, but I don't think I'll do that again. It smelled like old lady perfume to me, so it was a little hard to drink. But yay for the pizza (I would've cried if they'd been out of that too!)!

It also came with your choice of soup or salad, so I'd say it's a pretty good deal.    The restaurant was nearly packed on a Saturday afternoon at 4:30 pm, so imagine what it must be like if we came at 6:30 pm.  Our waiter was earnest and helpful, but our drinks and food did take a long time to show up.  Good choices for kid's menu as well, all for $3.95, which includes a drink, but sundae is extra for $0.95 more.   Bottom line:  Big food portions.  The menu tried to have a little bit of everything to please everybody.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=940

What were they thinking when they put BJ's Brewery, P.F. Chang, Buca di Beppo, and Cheesecake Factory next to each other? They built the parking lot big enough to only accomodate maybe 2 of those restaurants' patrons. My advice is to come early or be prepared to circle the parking lot dozens of times to find an available spot. A lot of people give BJ's more credit than it deserves in my opinion. Sure the pizza is good, but the beer? It's not the best beer that I've had. Their hefeweizen is okay but I still prefer the real German stuff.

Michael H.,"Hayward, CA",319,1404,650,3.0,5/27/2008,"I would definitely choose this place over a TGIF or Applebee's for it's relaxed atmosphere and decent food.  If you have a group bigger than eight people visiting during evening hours, you'll most likely have to wait awhile to get a table.  The servers are relatively hospitable. Generally if you have a huge number of people, they'll sit you outside so that it's more private and generally easier for the wait staff.  What's helpful is that they set up a plastic tent if it gets windy or cold. The food is so-so; kinda hit or miss.  You just have to think in a broad sense when choosing your order.  Nothing really stands out.  One time my friend had a huge b-day bash here, thus the manager setup an all you can eat pasta bar -- a pretty cool deal, but again the pasta was so-so. The rest of the menu is your typical American bar food.  Burgers, sandwiches (hot/cold), steak, chicken, and deep dish pizza.  Getting two deep dish pizzas and sharing is a good idea. The pizookie that is somewhat legendary is just okay.  Yeah I said it!  Hahaha.  It's definitely good if you've been on a diet.  But if you eat crap all week like I do, it's nothing special.  You're better off making a huge one at home and scooping insane amounts of ice cream on it.  Wow I sound fat. __ A good alternative to the crap American food chains.  A nice place to watch the game with a beer or to have your b-day dinner.  Just don't expect much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=940

NOPE haha -1 Oakridge parking is terrible. -1 The wait can be fairly long if you go on a busy night.  -1 Because 95% of the time I come here, the service is TERRIBLE. For instance. One time we were seated, waited around for a good 25mins. Had to GET UP and ask for a waiter to come and take our orders. The waiter had not even checked in with us at ALL after we had been seated! We would have been a bit more sympathetic if it had been a busy night. But it was NOT. We even saw a few of the waiters/waitresses standing around and talking! So then, why do we come here if it's rated so crappy? Well, whenever we come now, we expect to wait, to have crappy service, and to have a hard time parking (gogo valet parking!). Usually when we head here, it's just the guys, leave the women at home, run to the bar right when we get seated, and get a pitcher for ourselves, order one from the waiter, so by the time the terrible-service-waiter/waitress brings us our pitcher we're done with the first! It's a great place to hang out, drink a few... pitchers, be loud, and have some grub. The food tastes fine, and is priced well. Although I only give it 2 stars, it's still one of the top places on my list to hit up when the guys wanna go chill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=820

No one paid attention to us, and we waited at least 15 minutes before someone stopped by to get our drinks order. Waiters were whizzing by but it took ANOTHER 15 minutes to get someone to take our appetizer order.

And if you like craft beer check out their imports/belgian menu.

You're in the drip seat!"".   4.  While trying to clear the plates, I was still picking at the last of my pizza.  I'm a firm believer in not wasting food, so I wanted to finish what I had even though I was extremely full.  She tried to take my plate from me but saw I was still eating and then mocked me for trying to finish my food.

DH and I were out doing our last bit of holiday errands, found ourselves out in Blossom Valley and decided BJs looked interesting.  Initially, we were seated at a small table in front. However, we were blasted with arctic air each time the door opened/closed, so we moved to a not so chilly table.  Service was on par and very solid. The quality of our meals is where points were lost (along with the piece of hair wrapped up in the napkin with the silverware).  DH ordered a Caesar salad and clam chowder soup. He commented that he soup was very fishy. The salad unmemorable.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger w/fries. The bacon was undercooked and chewy, so off the burger it went. Pass on the bacon. The bun was solid, but the toppings could have been fresher, as they were a bit limp. The meat was good quality, although just a tad too over seared. About halfway through, the charcoal flavor dominated.  The fries were uninspiring and undercooked. Pass.  We also ordered a side of onion strings. These were quite possibly the worst onion strings we have ever encountered. Soggy, limp, undercooked and seasoned with an array of flavorings that just don't work well together. Pass.

Cool if you wanna get something like Guiness but I always get their beer when I'm here so doesn't really affect me. $1 off all cocktails.

So yes, it's the beer, the beef dips, the pizza, the burgers... but a taste of Chicago? Nahhhh. Portillo's PLEASE come to San Jose!!!!!! I still regularly eat the casual meal or get-together at BJ's though. I like the wedge salad, I like the sliders (mmmm) and the Beef Dip sandwich with horseradish sauce is palatable too. The proprietary Blonde beer is good. And for a kick now and then, so is their beer sampler. The wall of big-screens, as well as the scattered sets around the joint are great for sports nights... always there's always a good crowd on hand for football, baseball and regional heroes like the Sharks. The service is generally friendly and attentive too. Really. The usual long wait there for a table, is more a testament to the sad state of good, casual restaurants in the area. But the menu is OK, the food is prepared as good as you'd like your average hamburger/ribs/pizza/chicken breast/salad - type restaurant to be... and the meals are priced at a pretty fair value.

I ordered my usual fettuccine alfredo but opted to add shrimp instead of chicken to 'switch things up a bit'.  And may I say that my pasta was super BLAND... (seriously, no taste whatsoever!!!) and the shrimp was way undercooked for my taste (I wish they seared it for some texture rather than just boiling it or however the HELL they cooked it). Boyfriend ordered the New York strip steak (medium BUT it came out medium well). He barely finished half of it because I think it was way too chewy.   When our server asked us about the food, we didn't bother sending it back because... well.... we've all watched that movie ""Waiting"", right? I didn't want any ""garlic salt"" added to my tasteless pasta. GROSS. Haha. So I just lied and said that everything was fine.  What a disappointment, though.  This place is usually pretty busy on the weekends, but we were seated in about 15 minutes, as promised. Maybe because it was a Sunday. Our server seemed like she was maybe having a bad day, but she did her part in checking up on us every now and then, so I won't ding her on her service. It wouldn't have hurt anybody to crack a smile every now and then though.  This place is a fun place to go and have drinks with friends and/or watch the game. Kinda on the loud side though, so probably not a good place to take your grandma to dinner unless you want to keep repeating yourself throughout the meal. I wish I could give it a higher rating but tonight's dinner was truly a disappointment. Maybe my next experience will redeem this place. I'll update the rating in the future. ______________________________ Their BBQ chicken pizza w/ cilantro is pretty good. I think you can opt out of the cilantro if you're not a fan, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=900

The wait can be horrible on weekends especially but to combat that I always go shopping to pass the time. By the time I'm done shopping I've def worked up an appetite.  I love the food here and I recommend all the pastas and burgers. I'm not a fan of their field of greens salad- just a weird combo and it didn't go together.  At this location, the manager and hosts are amazing. So sweet and very helpful. We were lucky enough to get a booth this time and a wonderful waitress named danielle. She checked up on us constantly and always had refills on hand. She was so nice and an ideal waitress. The only time we ever had to flag her down was to get our bill but we found out that we were overcharged on the dessert so she was trying to find the manager to fix it before she gave us the bill.  Usually bj's has overall really good service and its just a nice atmosphere to be around.

Kelle Belle J.,"Los Gatos, CA",6,41,19,1.0,3/7/2012,"Decided to call ahead and put our names on the call ahead list. When my fiance and I arrived on a Sunday night it was busy and we were glad we called ahead. The hostess gave us a buzzer and we sat down next to the hostess stand on a bench after she told us it would be about 10 - 15 minutes. About 30 minutes later we are still waiting and we start seeing them seat people that were after us, but I didn't nag them because I have been a hostess before and I hate when people ask ""how much longer?"" 10 minutes later my fiance convinced me that we should go talk to the hostess and when I went up there to let them know we have been waiting well past the estimated time, she told us she already called us......I was stunned. I told her we had been sitting next to her the whole time and we were never called. She said ""oh....it actually looks like your buzzer malfunctioned so we called you on the loud speaker"" I told her that's not true and I named off the two different names she called on the loud speaker. Then she had the nerve to say ""see this right here (pointing to the loud speaker)....this is what we called you on."" She is not even the one that calls the names, so she was just assuming someone else did it. I was so mad that she was being so rude and lied straight to my face I was speechless. Then she turned around and had one of the hosts take us to our table with NO apologies or compensation. Worst customer service EVER here.

She was going to introduce us to him, but he was doing something, so she said that he'd be in to check up on us. This guy never came. We received our orders from a bus boy. And that was it. We didn't get service for about 30 minutes. No drink refills. No questions of whether or not we needed anything. Nothing. Luckily we knew the hostess. She ended up serving us. She refilled our drinks, and even took our dessert order. The manager finally came and apologized to us. He offered us a $25 gift certificate to the restaurant. We took it and just used it to pay for our dinner that night. It ended up that the server guy just never came.

We went around 5:00pm, so it wasn't busy at all and we were able to get a table immediately.  Our server was one of the best servers we have ever had anywhere!  She took our drink and food orders right away, and told us that if we didn't like anything we could always get something else.  We both got chicken dishes, which were both absolutely delicious, and we then got a strawberry dessert which was delicious as well!  By the time we left the restaurant it was around 6:30/7:00, and there were tons of people waiting.  I would definitely recommend getting to the restaurant around 5:00 or so if you don't want to have to wait.  The food was wonderful, the service was one of the best, and the prices were decent.  We would definitely go back here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=880
Liz L.,"New York, NY",272,164,2,3.0,2/13/2009,"I would give this place 4 stars.. but I have to take away 1 for the parking here.. which really sucks because it is at Oakridge Mall ... and also because of the service we got here last night.. There were many parties there.. so I could understand the lack of quality service.. but they weren't doing too well on taking our orders promptly and refilling our waters..  I've been to a couple of BJ's before.. so I already know what to expect when I come here... the beer is great.. but if you haven't tried it already.. get the Raspberry Framboise... its SOOO GOOD.. its kind of like a raspberry flavored beer.. and its on tap! I haven't found another bar/restaurant that actually served it around here..  As for the food... I think all of the food is pretty good here... I've had the jambalaya, balsamic glazed chicken, pizza, derek's meatloaf, pasta... can't go wrong w/ any of those..  Their happy hour on weekdays I believe is from 9-close?

Me and my friend Joe or more so I needed something to nosh on after class, so we went here. The food was standard, I found myself dumping a lot of salt on this pasta with cream sauce that I had. I held back from a Pazookie which was sad, but I was dumping a lot of salt made me bloated. But the food was decent and is good a late night standard. The only quip was I had a good 10 minutes before someone even noticed I was sitting at my table. And that's even to the point where I wondered if I was going to get any service.

John P.,"San Jose, CA",2,4,,1.0,9/15/2010,"My girlfriend had probably one of the worst dining experiences of all time! Our server did NOT want to be there. It was written all over his face. When he took our drink order, I ordered an iced tea and a water, my girlfriend ordered a water. When he came out with the drinks, he handed me the water and gave her the tea. He started to walk away, then stopped and came back to ask her if she wanted sweetner. I said ""yes, I'd like some for my tea"". It took him 10 minutes to bring it to the table! Each time we asked him for something (a total of 3), he would roll his eyes as he walked away. At least wait until you're in the kitchen where no customers can see you! Ranting on about the server...he constantly wiped or touched his nose. It looked like he had snorted an 8-ball of coke in the bathroom before his shift started! The more he touched his nose, the more I didn't want to eat my food. It was a Tuesday night, so the place wasn't crowded...but there were groups of servers just standing around, talking, laughing....blocking walkways...you know, nothing too terrible. The person working the curbside pick-up spent 10 minutes texting someone without looking up from his phone. Too bad he didn't see the people trying to get his attention so they could get their food and get the hell out of there. OMG it must have been such a GR8 txt convo LOL. I would have liked to tell a manager about my unfavorable experience, but there weren't any to be found. They were probably doing lines of coke in the bathroom with our server!

Well, its a bit ways from me since I live near SJSU and I must drive down 87 to get to Oakridge just to have BJ's. But let me see, what to say about BJ: Food is decent and affordable. The few times that I have come here I have tried the G)-MORMOUS baked potatoes. I swear I have never seen such a large baked potato at a reasonable price. I kid you not, they are not the standard tiny ones you see at Wendy's. Its like a size of a Mans shoe, like maybe size 8-10....massive if you ask me. Yes, I really recommend the Grilled Chicken baked Potato if you decide to try it. DELICIOUS! I have also tried the Grilled Chicken Pasta and that too is served in a generous portion for a decent price. To end on a good note, my friends and I shared two types of Pizookies that they offered and I hear they are famous for making them. It was good but I don't know if its THAT amazing.  Overall, I give them a 3.5 to four stars. They are decently priced with pretty good portion sizing. Um, dessert felt fattening, and service was great too.

Ordered a big sampler platter, a Piranha Pale Ale, and a Shrimp Pasta Entree.  The sampler platter was ok, the avocado egg rolls weren't so good but the artichoke dip was great. The beer tasted pretty good as well. The spaggetti shrimp entree I got was HUGE! I didn't finish it because I guess I filled up on the sampler, my caesar salad and the 2 big cuts of bread they give you with the entree.  The spagetti sauce seemed a bit watered down and the shrimp was so so. Dinner and the beer with the tip cost me about 40 bucks so plan to spend some money if you show up.

She stopped by to ask how our food was and without even listening to our answer scurried off.  The kicker was when she took my girlfriends last bite of pizza when she cleared our plates.  She didn't bother to ask if she was finished and before we knew she was gone with it.  She quickly brought our check and said ""here is your check no rush"" and came back only a minute later to try and collect a signed copy....my girlfriend still had half a beer left !!!  That was the straw...I tipped her lousy.  It takes a whole lot to make me do that.  Even mediocre service gets 15-20% from me because I always give them benefit of the doubt. It was busy.... but no matter how busy I never expect to be rushed.  Its not like we were trying to loiter.  Her name was Sarey according to the receipt.  Beware of this cute brown haired, fake smiling, RUSHER!.  On a lighter note...l love BJs and the Drakes IPA they have there is top notch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1000

The food here is the usual burgers, pizzas, and pasta entrees-- typical diner food but really flavorful and delicious to eat. Their happy hour options and prices are mediocre. The must have item on the menu is their pizookie. The pizookie is soooo good I wouldn't mind having it for my meal. It comes in five different flavors. So far, I tried the cookies and cream and the white chocolate macadamia pizookie and both were extraordinarily good.

I took my Mother to a belated Mother's Day lunch and I was impresses with the service here. We got there around 11:30 am before the lunch rush and we were able to get parking right up front. There was no wait and we were sat right away. Which is amazing for the Westfield Shopping Plaza. We started with Wings and ordered drinks. I never had their homemade Root beer, but I decided to try it because it was too early to drink beer. The Root beer was refreshing and there was a fresh crispness to it There was also free refills. .My Mom decided on an Iced Tea and a Sandwich Combo. I ordered the Bj's. Special Sm. Pizza and a Broccoli Cheddar Soup. I love the Hot Wings here because they have a little sauce on them, and you can dip as much sauce you want because they are served with a Bleu Cheese and Wing sauce on the side. The soup was for my lil' one and was very cheesy and delicious. The pizza was the perfect size for one person. My Mom liked her Clam Chowder and California sandwich minus the Red peppers. Our waiter was attentive and everything came out on time. My only regret with this visit was that I did not get my Beer, and I did not save room for the Pizzookie. You know, the one dessert Cookie that comes out all warm with Ice cream on top. Overall visit was great and the only blemish was the Hostess did not wait for us when we were being seated.

Cindy N.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/18/2010,"I got a Yelp account today just so I could finally bitch about the most horrible experience ever! The world deserves to know!! We went to this BJ's for my little sister's 18th birthday. She booked a table for 30 a month in advance. Even so, BJ's kept changing the time on us! We originally reserved it for 6PM, but the next time we called back to give them our buffet choices, they told us it was moved to 7PM. No one called to tell us this before! On top of that, they couldn't even take our buffet choices because the manager was busy and no one else could do that. They told us they would call us back, but they never did... When we called them again closer to the day, they told us the reservation was at 6PM and that they had no record of it being at 7PM, and once again the manager was busy in a meeting so they would call us back to get our buffet choices... and once again, there was no phone call! At this point we were really fed up with the service and considered cancelling the reservation but thought that it was too close to the day (less than a week) so it would be too short notice for our guests so we didn't. The day of the reservation, someone from BJ's called us to confirm our reservation. They said it was at 7PM... again! And told us to bring some paper/form for the reservation that we didn't have and that no one had told us about before. Because of the constant change of times, only half of our invited guests were able to make it. The manager spoke to my sister, the birthday girl who made the reservation, about the lack of people as if that were her fault for overbooking or something! Even though she tried to be polite about it, we could all tell how pissed off and annoyed she was. We waited and were seated at a table for 12 even though we specifically asked for a table for 15 because a few other people were on their way. The table was outside so it was cold, but we could clearly see our table for 30 was inside... Couldn't they have just split that in half?? Our waiter was no better than the manager. He tried to be polite and friendly, but we could all tell that he had not wanted to be stuck with our group of mostly high school students. When he took our orders, he was impatient, so he only took a few orders. We waited forever before he would come back to take the rest. During the meal, he was rude in his actions, snatching plates and utensils away while glaring at some of the kids and making fun of others... Maybe he thought they were being immature for some reason and didn't like that? When my sister asked for her complimentary birthday pizookie, he was reluctant to get her one. When he finally did bring one out, the ice cream was melted, there was no singing, he just plopped it down in front of her, lit the candle, and told her to blow it out. That was it. At the end of the meal when the check came out, my brother and I had to count the cash to make sure there was enough. With that many people there all paying cash, it took a while. The waiter was impatient again and kept coming by our table to see if we were done with the check... When we were, he snatched it right out of my brother's hand, couldn't even wait for him to hand it to him. We left that night not at all satisfied with our experience. The service was absolutely horrid!!! I don't know why we didn't just walk next door to Bucca instead. Never again will any of us go to a BJ's for any reason. 15 customers gone for good.

The food was good- I got the rotisserie chicken and it was moist and juicy without being greasy. My daughter got the grilled cheese and seemed happy. We didn't wait long for a table despite the fact it was a Friday night and very crowded. Service was good. My husband loves the tri-tip and the avocado egg rolls, so I'm sure we'll be back, though next time we may just get takeout. My advice?

We got there after 5 and were seated about ten minutes later, in the patio. Now there was a chill in the air but they had heat lamps. We got seated under one of those heat lamps, and .. woo!! It got a little too warm, so we asked if it could be shut off .. they complied.  My friend and I kept it simple, sharing chips and salsa, each having the Turkey Cobb sandwich with fries and she had a Pomegranate margarita, while I had a glass of White Zinfandel. So far so good. Now that night there was a hockey game on (of which we are both fans), and since they had televisions, we asked if the channel could be changed. Sadly they didn't have that channel.  When it came time for dessert, my friend ordered the Triple Chocolate Pizookie and I the BJ Brownie. She ate hers entirely, whereas I could not finish. Getting the brownie out of that little tin it comes in was hard enough, but two scoops of ice cream (which I can usually eat) and all that whip cream was tough. Perhaps because of all I had eaten already, but the brownie wasn't great. I have a sweet tooth but this was a little much. And aside from the Pizookie, a root beer float and an apple crisp there isn't much in terms of variety.

I've enjoyed the salads, pizza and burgers there, but my favorite item is the pizookie. It's a must try, but make sure to share, since it's way too much for one person.  They have a much larger selection of non-alcoholic drinks than most restaurants I've been too, but no Dr. Pepper. The service has been good every time I've gone, but the wait can be a little long if you get there at the wrong time.  If you are going with a large group, they do take reservations but unless you are going with less then 17 they will require you to set up a contract and it will limit your food choices. This is good for banquets, but not good if you have a group of friends like mine with varied food preferences. Recently went with a large group of 16 and made a reservation but they didn't have record of it when we showed. Luckily they had room and were able to accommodate us, but I will not go there with a large group again. Luckily our service once seated was stellar and so I almost completely forgot about the ""missing"" reservation.  Therefore I do recommend them for smaller groups, but large groups are not a good idea in my opinion.

I have never met a manager in the hospitality business that treated me as rudly as Mr. Casey.  When he approached us his attitude was as if WE did something wrong. He also seemed more focused on punishing the waitress(publicly) then trying to give us good service. He ended up not compensating us for our meal which was ruined. The money is not my complaint though. A manager should never treat a customer like the way he treated our family. I don't know if he is new or in over his head.

Daniel B.,"Fremont, CA",58,23,,4.0,2/26/2009,"BJ""s is one of my favorite restaurant chain..... One reason could be that i am a boozer and the beer sampler they have here for around 8 bucks, me likey! They also have a good amount of specialty beers (like the blue chamaine) with pretty good alcohol contents. Another reason perhaps, is the pizza (""the great white"" in particular). It is absolutely scrumptious and considering that BJ's isn't exactly a pizza joint, it says a lot for their food. Another delicious menu item are the stuffed baked potatoes.....filled with loads of good, artery clogging ingredients, the potato will definitely  have you begging for a nap by the time you are done eating it......well if that wasn't enough, try one of their delicious Pizookies. It is a desert masterpiece and will most likely put you in a diabetic coma for several hours (I never realized that sugar could force involuntary muscle movement, until I had one of these puppies) Overall, this is a great ""kick it' spot with a buddy or dinner with a lady friend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1060

These shrimp were just cooked in oil/butter, no seasoning. The Caesar salad..was Caesar salad. The shrimp on my salad, I could pass on. I probably had 4-5 shrimp total.

I think the pizza would have better if they didnt drizzle Tobasco sauce all over it. And the Spagetti was pretty dry. I did like the RootBeer though. I really enjoyed going just because we got to hang out with friends. But BJ's I think drop the ball on food for large parties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040

Kathy B.,"Fremont, CA",2,20,4,3.0,7/5/2011,"The food is usually great, but sometimes the service can be a bit on the slow side.  The last few times we went there, we didn't see the server as much as I'd like to see them.  Other than that, it is usually a nice experience, and I still frequent this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040
Alejandra A.,"Los Gatos, CA",10,44,23,4.0,10/4/2008,We enjoyed our first experience at BJ's today. The Lunch Specials are great. We ordered the Mini Pizzas and an Appetizer. The pizza was good and the service top. Our waiter was attentive always and refilling drinks and bringing what we asked quickly. The TV's and young college crowd makes the place an ideal environment for any sports fan. Highly recommend the Mini Lunch Pizzas. Overall great Lunch Menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040

JAYE m.,"San Jose, CA",4,25,16,4.0,4/4/2011,"I am big fan of brewhouse restaurants and always wanted to come here so for the first time I did for my birthday this past week. The outside is really nice doesn't look like a brewhouse but it looks classy what can you say it's connected to a mall. My family and I walked in had no reservations so we waited 25 minutes not bad for a place that's kind of small inside but have a lot of seats outdoors. Get to my table and greeted nice service here is great always making sure your having a good time lol even the chef came out to see if the food was good. We order drinks I start off with their 8 beer tester then a order a aged belgian ale man their beer selection is out of this world, and then order food man to much to choose from it all looked good but i am a fan of pizza and ordered a BJ's favorite. All in all I would come back here no doubt I wouldn't have to think about because BJ's I love and I mean BJ's by the restaurant lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040
Judy T.,"Fremont, CA",6,55,3,3.0,4/1/2007,This is a nice place to eat at the mall if you want better than food court food.  I had the turkey cobb sandwich for $8.95 which came with seasoned wedge fries.  The portion was plenty; I took home half the sandwich.  Fountain drinks prices are not listed on the menu; it is $2.40 with free refills.  The kids' menu is reasonable too.  $3.95 with a drink.  A kids' sundae is also listed on the menu but isn't included with the meal.  It costs an extra $1.  Service was good.  We ate early and avoided the huge wait we saw outside when we left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040
Amanda M.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,2.0,8/9/2011,Their service is kinda slow. Nothing on their menu really strikes me. They no longer have my favorite dish (shrimp chardonnay pasta). Their avacado egg roll appetiezer is BOMB!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040
Laura G.,"San Jose, CA",2,15,,1.0,10/25/2009,"Usually Im a big fan of this place.  The food is delicious!  Unfortunately today was a different story.  A friend and I went for dinner and our server was so bad it ruined the entire meal.  We started off with soup and salad, my friend asked for pepper which the server never brought.  I had finished my soda before our food arrived, and our server never noticed and never brought a refill.  When our food arrived, my sandwich had a a piece of trash sitting on it.  Literally!  It was a piece of a sticker or paper or something that had been on the floor and had dirt all over it, and it was sitting on my sandwich.  Im not that picky but it was frigging disgusting.   I waited a good five minutes at least for the server to come check on us and take the sandwich back.   Then a bus boy brought it out without the ranch I had asked for.  I waited another 5  mins and finally flagged down the server for ranch.  She said she would be right back with it, then proceeded to go to the bar, deliver a drink, check on 4 more tables, run a check to another table, clear some dishes away and FINALLY came back with my side.  WTF!!  My friend had finished her meal almost before I started.  All this time, I still had an empty drink but clearly waiting for our server to do anything about it was a waste of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040
C M.,"Morgan Hill, CA",103,236,1,3.0,12/11/2008,"Had a large group of about 30, they told me they could do a buffet style for that many so i chose to do a pizza, pasta and salad buffet. They have you choose ahead of time what type of pizza you want, choose 4...pasta ( wouldn't recommend the marinara, wasn't good at all) and cesar vs house salad. PIzza was okay, i would expect the buffet to be on warmers or something but they were just kind of cold. I hate cold food so...the salad was good though. My friends were nice enough to get us a pizzookie which was like- the best part of the meal. It came out like a big pizza cookie with like half a gallon of vanilla ice cream on it. It started melting so we tried to cut slices like a pizza. MMM it was like so good. Freshly baked it was hot and the chocolate chips were all gooey. Half was white chocolate and the other half was regular. It was enough to feed like 10 people!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040
Jo P.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,,4.0,8/3/2009,I've ate a BJ's several times and haven't been disappointed yet. I wouldn't recommend coming during evenings as it gets super busy but daytime eating is always enjoyable. I love their giant baked potatoes - I've tried all the different combos and really cant' decide which one is my favorite. The service I received has been a bit inconsistent but nothing so horrible I wouldn't come back again. Their rootbeer is very good as well as the other variety of drinks they serve. This is a fun place to eat with family or friends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040
Debra S.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/25/2011,"I had a wonderful dining experience at BJ's last night.  Our group started with some mini plates of bruchetta, tacos and stuffed mushrooms which were all tasty.     My chicken parmesan was delicious and a large portion (took half home and ate it for lunch-still yummy). My guests were equally happy with their choices.   Our server Danny was fun, cute,  professional and provided outstanding service with a smile. He definately added to a wonderful dining experience. I will definately be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040
Nick H.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,3.0,7/19/2009,"Ok, every time I sit down to look at the menu at BJ's nothing ever stands out. I could never understand why people love this place to the point were they will wait for an hour to get seated?  I will admit that the beer is half decent and the Great White Pizza is really good, but everything else is below average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040

Francis J.,"San Jose, CA",0,79,,4.0,5/25/2011,"Been here 2 times and the service is on point. Ordered different items the 2 times i went here and i really liked both of them. I went here for my birthday the 2nd time, and since i turned 21 i decided to get an alcoholic beverage. I tried the strawberry splash which is a favorite it said, but im not a fan of it, it just tasted like numbing gel that they put on your tooth at the dentist. the server kept greeting me happy birthday which i thought was very thoughful, and you also get a free pazookie on your bday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-jose?start=1040
