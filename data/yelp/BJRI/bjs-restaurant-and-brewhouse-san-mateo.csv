Ninja R.,"Tracy, CA",0,31,15,1.0,9/15/2017,Well I can't rate the food here since we never actually got to eat. Checked the website for wait list status before we got here it said open no wait. Ok... It's 530 on a Friday that's dinner rush time and you should be staffed accordingly (I worked as a server for 15 years and that's my experience) the host took his time to seat two groups of 2 in front of us then slowly walked over and asked how many I told him 3. Without blinking he said 15 minute wait.  There were open tables and booths  everywhere. I pointed this out and he mentioned there was no server. A huffy girl took us all the way in the back to a dirty table with no menus.  We left.  Not worth the effort to eat here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=80
Diver N.,"San Leandro, CA",1,4,,2.0,11/18/2017,"Great food, bad service. and understaffed. Ordered takeout for curbside pick up. Arrived curbside, called at least a dozen times for 10 mins, but nobody answered so decided to go inside instead to pick up. Stood in line for about 20 mins just to pick up the order. Told them we had called from curbside several times about half an hour ago - no apologies at all. On the way out, another BJ employee had the balls to tell us that the curbside parking was only for those who need curbside service.

Renee B.,"San Mateo, CA",1,16,,5.0,9/5/2017,"Love the bar at BJs and my special bartender Angelina!  I'm a fan and appreciate her great service.  The bar is usually crazy busy and Angelina is never too busy to get me a beverage or food.  The rest of the bar staff is great too.  Super service oriented and always willing to put my game on one of the 7 TVs.  Truly a great place to get a drink, a meal and a game.  Thanks bar staff!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=80

Shanise M.,"Redwood Shores, CA",308,301,1888,3.0,10/20/2015,"I have a weak spot for big chain restaurants like BJ's... the food is oh so average and the prices are oh so high - but it's just something about these restaurants that make me keep coming back!? I've been to this location countless times since I was a kid - even had one of my birthday dinners here when I was about... 14? 15? Strange times. Anyway - I've been back a few times in these recent years for appetizers and drank. Usually not here for a full meal because it's so $$$. Appetizers are big enough that they can be split - portion and money wise. BJ's has their own brews which is such a huge plus for a chain restaurant. Although their brews are average, I still enjoy trying what's available and the occasional seasonal ones. Plenty of guest brews (tap and bottle) which rotate from time to time.  Huge ass menus. It's hard to pick something every time. I usually end up picking the same ol' thing just to avoid the indecisiveness. I've gotten the carnitas fries twice now and I was surprised both times as to how good they were... the fries were extra thing and crispy just how I like. All their pizzas are also usually really good. Burgers are pretty average though they hit the spot when you have a burger craving. Everything else is pretty so-so. Fun to just order new things sometimes to share with a group. Service has been okay - can be really slow at times but waiters are friendly. Food takes forever to come out. May as well call in an order before you arrive... When it's busy, waiting and food service gets even slower. Thankfully, I don't really come in during rush hours anymore - I just stick to early afternoons now. Your average chain restaurant. Probably best to go in a big group or on game days if you want optimal fun and don't care for slow wait times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=80
Sheba B.,"San Francisco, CA",2,48,,3.0,12/28/2016,"We came here not too long ago during the late afternoon and our waiter (Zach, Zachary?) was awesome, thin, youngish guy with black hair and a short beard. We were a small group of four, and the place wasn't very busy at all, which maybe is why (Zach) was able to attend to us so well. So, the stars are basically for him. It's basically a chain so, how can you really rate it. The menu sort of reminds me of an Applebee's and a Chili's rolled into one, with less options. The food is ok. It feels you up, with some leftovers if you're not too greedy. So portion sizes are decent. We were seated in less than t0 mins. We received menus and beverages right away. Our orders were taken and the food came out shortly after...hot. Zach kept the free refills coming while my cousin kept the poor guy hopping with her numerous requests. Throughout it all Zach continued smiling and responded professionally and positively. Behind closed doors he probably cursed us out!

Ed C.,"Eugene, OR",0,10,,1.0,8/28/2017,"Apparently not all BJs were created equal. I've been to BJs in other cities a few times and were pretty satisfied. Probably there are too many fancy restaurants in the Bay Area and this BJ just gave up trying to compete. In fact, a Dennys would beat it hands down. The waiter/waitress pair were careless and indifferent. Silverware and napkins, and later on, meals, were thrown at the edge of the table - up to us to move them into position. It took a very long time for food to show up. When it did - we got wilted salad greens, rubber-like asparagus, overcooked meat and under cooked rice pilaf. Presentation was messy too. The floor surface was also dirty. One glance at it killed the remaining appetite. A weak link in the BJ chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=80
Daniel W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,,1.0,6/19/2017,"Deceptively false advertising. ""deep dish"" pizza is a misnomer. Bait and switch, false pretense, whatever. Call it thick crust, but it's not deep dish. Their photos with cast iron pans are lies - they aren't deep dish at all. Very upset I bought $100 of BJ's gift cards, to get deep dish regularly, and it turns out to be just regular thick crust. Fast creation - only 15 minutes, however the pizza was NOT hot - had to go back and microwave it. While they offered to remake it or comp a dessert/salad, I said no. I want it made correctly, the first time. I don't want to waste 15-20 minutes for you to fix what should have been done correctly. Additionally, the pizza was smashed against the side of the box when I received it. Very disappointed. California law says merchants are required to redeem a GC for cash of under $10.00.

We all ordered and our food came out about 15 minutes later. My shrimp tacos were cold so I asked them to refire and this is where things went south. The food never came back out...5 min...10 min...15...20. Finally I cancelled it because everyone else was done.  I give this 4 stars because the manager was really kind and provided the shrimp tacos anyways and took a little off the bill.

Actually I prefer the San Bruno location better (personal preference, that's all) but traffic won over this location tonight. It was crowded when we arrived, not super packed, but it got more crowded & noisey as the evening wore on.  We were seated & served rather quickly. Our waitress was nice, a tad bit scattered, but not a deal breaker. We ordered Avocado Egg Rolls, which I could happily eat a whole plate of these. Delish, as always!  I ordered Fish Tacos (Well, it is STILL Taco Tuesday, right?) which was good. Not great, but hey it's tacos!!  Something just didn't seem right with the tortilla, but I ate it.

It was a shorter wait time so we decided it should be fine to get in and out quick. It was not quick. By the time our waitress came to our table we were ready to order everything. We got our food in a timely manner but we were not checked in on for about 30 minutes since we got our food and by then we were almost ready for the check by that point.  The worst part of the service was that we had asked for a box before the check arrived and once we put a card out for the payment she grabbed that assuring she would grab us boxes. When she walked away she kept bouncing around from table to table which is fine, that's her job. Our boxes for the food finally arrived shortly she dropped off our card back to us. I have never asked for a box multiple times like this or had a box delivered to the table so late in any restaurant experience of mine and it just makes me think that BJs is an unprofessional establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=60

Julie L.,"Redwood City, CA",345,136,266,2.0,7/30/2016,"I generally love BJ's, the service, the brews, and the food. However, after 3 consecutive negative experiences, I think two stars are necessary. I have always loved the pasta and flatbreads at BJs. I've also enjoyed eating pizookies and drinking their ambers, however, I think this location just has staff and waiters who aren't trained properly. Came here with a large group of friends and started off ordering a salad. I know large groups are difficult to deal with AND I had an allergy request, but it took three tries and over an hour before I got my food. I'm allergic to tomatoes and nuts. Our waiter came back after we had ordered to tell me that something in the salad contained nuts and it could not be made without nuts, so he had me order something else off of the allergen menu. I ordered a club flatbread. The waiter didn't hear the flatbread part, and I ended up with a club sandwich. Later, the waiter brought me the flatbread that I ordered but forgot about my tomato allergy. So about 30 minutes after the last attempt, after my friends had finished eating, I finally received the flatbread that I wasn't allergic to.  I came back here again for lunch with my dad and had a mishap with the bill. My dad had ordered the salmon and couscous for lunch. But our waiter charged us for a dinner sized portion. My dad didn't mind paying the more expensive meal, however, he wanted to point out that it wasn't what he ordered. The waiter was very rude and insisted he was correct and my father was in the wrong. Then he said he would adjust the price of the meal and make it the lunch price instead. But had to add that it was my father's mistake. Later when the final bill came, we saw that he didn't adjust the price at all. However, after waiting 30 minutes for him to get us the bill, we were tired of waiting and left just paid the bill and left. On a third recent experience, we were served what seemed to be scraps of mushrooms as ""stuffed mushrooms."" Upon first glance, the mushrooms seemed to be leftover scraps of mushrooms, some whole, some pieces, some tiny. Then we actually took a bite and realized that they were cold. Not room temperature or lukewarm, but cold. We asked our waiter if their stuffed mushrooms were supposed to be cold, and she seemed surprised and replied no. We were just very confused as to how this was an appetizer you would actually serve people. Also at this dinner, we ordered flatbread pizzas, which were uncut or only cut in half. And after pointing that out to the waitress, she just gave us steak knives for us to cut our flatbreads ourselves. After these three confusing and unpleasant recent experiences, I just hope other BJs haven't fallen to this level. I truly hope employees at this BJs will be trained to a higher level in the future so that the quality of this restaurant doesn't continue to drop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=60

Last night I ordered the Sriracha Queso Dips, with Pork Chile Verde topping, followed by a Crispy Jalapeno Burger.   The appetizer arrived and I started tucking in.  Then I realized...wait a minute...the dip is just cheese.  I drew this to the attention of my server, who said she would take it up with the kitchen.  While I was waiting, my burger arrived.  It's a good burger and has never let me down, but I was almost finished it by the time my revised appetizer arrived.  At this point I needed a top up on my soda, so asked for it. Again, I started tucking in.  Again, I couldn't find any pork.  This time the dip was cheese and chile verde. No pork!  Again, I drew this to the attention of the server, who said she's go back to the kitchen and also get her manager over to talk to me.   The server came back and informed me that there isn't actually pork in the ""Pork Chile Verde"".  Apparently its just ""made with pork""...presumably the stock.  In the UK, we have a thing called the ""Trade Descriptions Act"".  You can't call something pork chile verde if it isn't pork.  And neither should BJs.  If you order nachos with beef chile, there's meat in it. I'd expect the same for ""pork chile verde"". Anyway, I was asked if I wanted a dessert and I said yes and ordered a mini pizzooki.  Again, they never let you down. Oh, and I asked where my soda was..... When done, I asked for my check.  I was heartened to see that the two appetizer had been fully taken care of.  Not so happy that they charged me for two burgers........not sure I'll bother with BJs on my next trip to San Mateo.  There are plenty of other places that do a good burger.  And some too that put pork in their pork chile verde.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=160

Pros: - interior:  spacious, ample seating - plethora of TVs at the bar....perfect for game days - overall, every meal I've ordered were made well and sufficiently palatable.   Cons: - SERVICE!!!  Each and every time I come to BJs, service is sloooow.  Slow from beginning to end...from getting a menu to the check.  From what I see on the floor, I don't think it's a problem with the servers' performance;  I think it's more to do with servers managing too many tables.  For example, we had a server (Angelina) who was also managing half of the bar floor, which was fully occupied.  That is a lot of orders to maintain for one person and to execute in a timely manner.  Because there were so many tables with small to medium parties, it took her awhile to finally reach us.  She was by no means slow or showed incompetency; she was quite fast and running to table to table like she was on fire; bless her heart.   If management just added one or two more servers on the floor especially on big game days, perhaps it will help expedite service (happier customers) and increase customer turnaround (higher profits).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=160

The service was fine. We sat in the bar with Sergio, and he was very accommodating and made excellent menu suggestions. The only problem with sitting in the bar is that service is really slow.  I ordered the turkey and ham sandwich. Customized because of dietary restrictions. Don't toast the bread. It arrived toasted. Bacon crispy. Bacon was barely cooked- they had to bring out crispy bacon. Add cucumber. Cubed cucumber arrived on a separate plate for me to put on my sandwich. Cucumber was so small that it all fell off. No tomatoes. Add avocado. Fries. Received a salad.  What a joke. Sergio had it removed from the bill. It was entirely disappointing and unappetizing. I hate toasted bread. They offered to remake it. ""No I don't want to wait another 15min for you to remake the sandwich. We have places to go to after dinner."" I was pretty pissed about receiving a salad instead of fries, but the sandwich being wrong pissed me off more.  I'm sick of this location.

Megan M.,"Berkeley, CA",2,5,3,1.0,5/23/2017,"A coworker and I decided to take a long lunch the other day and eat at BJs since it's down the street. When we arrived, no one was at the host stand to seat us, so we decided we would sit at the bar since we wanted a drink anyway. Although there were plenty of open tables in the bar, they were covered in messes left behind by previous patrons; again, we weren't all that bothered (having worked in the restaurant industry myself as a server) and we just cleared half of a high top table for us to sit at. After about 10 minutes we were noticed and the server was somewhat pleasant but unkempt looking and she half-heartedly apologized and said she would get the table cleared off for us. It took about 10 before she finally came back to us for a drink order. We got our drinks and 15 minutes after that, she came back for us to order food, I was just starting to speak when she said ""hold on, ill be back"" and just walked away. we sat there another 15 minutes and nothing. no server in sight. keep in mind, it was not packed. it had actually thinned out even more than it was when we arrived. So if you've been doing the math, we've now been sitting there for 50 minutes and have received 1 drink. Finally, I got up and found another server to close us out. Our original server came back all huffy and when I said thank you she just shot me a dirty look and stormed off again to go ignore more customers.

It is one of his favorite restaurants. As for me, I would give it 4 and 3/5 stars if I could. A little less than 5 because occasionally an entree isn't quite perfect. Overall, the food is really good, or solid, depending on what you order, the service is great, and they always try to make things right if you aren't happy. My favorite menu item is the Parmesan crusted chicken, followed by the sriracha Brussels sprouts. Good beer selection too.

I went simple with the food. Cheesburger and french fries, and it was really quite yummy.  Service is friendly, if slow. Do I recommend it? I don't not recommend it.

Somphet P.,"San Mateo, CA",365,22,7,1.0,1/7/2018,"1 star for this location and BJs mobile app when it comes to customer service experience. 3 stars for the food selection.  I know this review is lengthy and long over due but please bare with me. BE CAREFUL  when using the BJs mobile app to place an order. Even after you've paid ahead of time using the app, the restaurant will see no payment status and therefore will have you pay at the counter; creating a duplicate payment on your order. This occurred on three separate occasions for me while using the BJs app that resulted in duplicate charges on my credit card. After discovering the duplicate transactions two weeks later, I spoke with the store manager and told them of the problem with the mobile app who assured me they would get in touch with their IT department. They also told me the refund could take up to ten business days and to check. After following up with the same manager three times over the course of four weeks with no resolution, I took it up with my creditors and filed a dispute. The way BJs restaurant handled my dispute was unacceptable. Please learn from my experience. Retain your paper recipes from the restaurant because I never received a refund on a credit card payment with a duplicate cash payment made at curb side.  I do hope a manager reads this review alone with a regional manager because I would be happy to discuss this over the phone a fourth time. To this date, BJs restaurant has done nothing to correct the situation regarding my duplicate payments.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo
Mrs J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,17,2,1.0,1/7/2018,"I would rather wait 30-45 mins for a table, than 30-45 mins for my FOOD! We have tried so hard to give this location hope that it would improve in customer service, turn around times, and wait time, that we have come to visit on 4 separate occasions, and each one just gets worse than the other. Ultimately, we have concluded that the entire staff at BJs is unmotivated to be better at what they do, and at the same time, can't blame them while their leadership team stands around and stares at them.  On this last occasion when we visited on Jan 6th, we arrived at 7:15pm. Waited 15 mins to be seated, and 30 mins for our meals, which arrived at 8:00pm (as I looked at my watch). The server severely lacked any follow through on refilling drinks and updating my family while we waited for food arrival to our table. Once it was delivered, there was no offer to provide condiments, extra napkins, utensils, drink refills, or if there was anything else we wanted to have. Nothing. This is a very similar trend on each visit as well.  Also, when setting new plates of food down on the table, the servers never pick up the empty dish ware that is no longer needed - even the manager noticed this and had to do it herself. Again, another trend in bad training. Although the person in charge that night knew how disappointed I was, it is very sad to know that my displeasure is what it took to actually get this team to start hustling and checking on all of their guests to make sure all was well. That's a shame. This supervisor did come back to the table with me to take over for said unenthused server, but offered no apology for me or the family for having to get up  and leave the table to find her and inconveniencing her to do her job and lead this team. (she was no help), to help rectify this situation. This is leadership immaturity at its finest. Their reaction to my complaint was clearly taken personally, when all they needed to do it resolve the matter on a professional level, and realize that it's not about them, but about the BJs brand. One simple apology would have saved the night. Of course, this was not apparent for this team in Foster City.  After that event, the server was then overly friendly in providing guest service, but by then, it was coming off as the most insincere effort ever. I lost my appetite and just wanted to leave. He offered a box, but I declined. I had no faith that a clean box would have been delivered to me with the prideful and egotistical attitudes I received for calling them out on their horrible guest/customer service. I ended up throwing away a practically full plate of food. Please note that my complaint was sincere, stern, but never offensive. It was difficult for me to comprehend why they had taken my concern so personally. Very odd when your mission is to run a smooth operation. Instead, the server complains about me to the table next to us, and those customers look at me as if I had made the BJs team  do more work than they should have. It was laughable and again, immature on the server's end.  If you see that your customer is upset over something, please take the time to find out why. Don't make it about yourself, because you may not know their story. We had just traveled through hours of long flight delays, and were so hungry when we got home. Our displeasure had nothing to do with anything but fatigue and hunger, but your ""who cares"" attitude just ended any and all hope we had for this store. We may actually return again. However when we do, we hope to see that you have improved in the aspects of morale, organization, turn around times, training, leadership, and overall customer service. I'm not that ""we'll never come back"" person. Experiences like this deserve to be attended to, and the company needs to know. This industry is a very familiar to me, so I intend on making sure you make some changes. We've been to some absolutely wonderful and fantastic BJs restaurants in Southern California and Las Vegas. Your store sets them down quite a few notches, which is unfair to the BJs corporation as a whole. Look beyond your walls, and try to see the big picture for the company's success. If you do that, you may just be recognized and rewarded by them as well. How is that not enough incentive and motivation for you?

Eren D.,"Belmont, CA",1,13,,2.0,1/5/2018,"We have been to this location over 10 times in the last 2 years, and it had  been an okay experience until today. They were never better or worse than what we expected, so I never thought of writing a review before. But today, they deserved this 2-star review. People who work here do not care that you wait there. They do not explain what's causing the wait, just keep giving stupid excuses. We used the BJ's app to put our name in the waiting list at 5:30pm. Got there at 5:45, with just another party waiting to be seated, and were told that it would take 10 mins for our table to be ready. We were finally seated at 6:18pm, so they wasted a good half an hour of our time waiting at a restaurant that was 20% full. When I asked, they said they were waiting for a table to open, but the back of the restaurant was completely empty except for a few tables.  I asked the host that took us to our table if there was a hold up in the kitchen, which I thought could be one reason to not seat people. In an arrogant way, he pointed at two waiters close by, and said that they have to help all the people in there. So the shortage of waiters should be acceptable by guests, that's the message I got from that. What's funny was the restaurant had at least 5 waiters walking around, and even finding time to joke with each other or get into arguments in front of guests.  We noticed that nobody who helped us was nice, or cared about helping anyone, except for our waiter. The guy who brought out our pizookie basically dropped it off on the edge of the table and left without saying anything. I probably sound like I expect too much from people, but I wouldn't last more than a few months if I had a similar attitude at my job.  Not sure if this place is under new management, but we will try to avoid it for a while.

Julie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",495,159,490,2.0,12/20/2017,"I came here for a birthday dinner and we were a pretty big group of people. Our servers were attentive, but one of our servers lost his voice so I felt pretty bad for him because he had to serve us and couldn't even talk - I felt like they should have given us another person, because it definitely must have been difficult to serve such a huge group of people while barely being able to talk.  I ordered the mini BBQ chicken pizza because I wasn't that hungry ($13.25??). The food came out pretty quickly and when it came to the table it looked pretty unappealing and I know it was a mini, but man was this SMALL for the price that it was. I seriously cannot believe they charged so much for the smallest pizza. It was also so MEDIOCRE - I have had better microwaved pizza. The pizza was soggy, bland, and I definitely would NEVER order it again. I was so disappointed, and that's all I could think about as I was eating the pizza - that it was super expensive and super boring. I know this is a chain, but man, I wouldn't have paid $5 for this pizza.  My friend ordered the full rack of ribs and he barely ate half of it. There was no meat on the bones, the ribs were lacking BBQ sauce, and they looked so dry looking. My other friend ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl and the clam chowder was super bland and tasted watered down. My brother ordered the shrimp scampi and I felt like the noodles were NOT drained completely because the bowl of pasta was super liquidy. The pasta was bland and it tasted like straight up pasta noodles with a hint of garlic.  This place is not worth it - the food is SO expensive for horrible food. The service isn't bad, but honestly I wouldn't return just because the service is good. There are so many things on the menu, they really should just focus on a few things and try to make those dishes really good. Overall, I don't think I'd be returning for the food.

The food here was also subpar - one of my favorite things to get from here is their BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza. The food tasted as if it had been sitting out and was even slightly burned.

It sounded like a great deal, but I should've known better than to order prime rib at a non-steak place. It was really fatty and it took so much work to cut into it. At least the sides were good, although the green beans had false advertising with the garlic in it. The pizookie to end made the meal all a little better though. At least I'd give it up for their drinks. We all had a round or two of their Irish Root Beer ($8.95) consisting of Jameson and Bailey's, which was yummy and a good hint of alcohol.

David A.,"Buford, GA",122,167,157,3.0,7/14/2017,"Popped in for a co-worker birthday today. Though we didn't get tanked like the large group next to us on shots, it was an ok time all around. This is typical for a BJs where it will never be horrible ... unless you show up at 7 pm. We were one of very few groups at 4:30, but by 6 the place was jam packed.   On the beer, my #1 and one of my favorite beers anywhere is the Jeremiah Red. The berry burst cider was also good today, but i was unimpressed by the porter, the LH lager, and the Oasis. For food, the happy hour specials aren't bad, but as I know from travelling a lot, you need the discount because of how high prices are in Silicon Valley. The flatbread veggie wasn't great, but was edible. The avocado spring rolls were awesome. The calamari was average. The spinach dip i think it was was very, very good. The Brussels sprouts were better than expected. We all did pizzas also, veggie, a pepperoni, and I did a five meat. In all cases they seemed a little undercooked and required a fork to eat.  The service was a little hit or miss. Despite being some of the first people there our apps were slow, and we waited a while at times for beer despite sitting at the table directly next to the bar. Our waitresses weren't rude, but their friendliness definitely didn't make us order more or tip more than 18%.  ... Overall you should never have a bad time here, other than when my wife ate something that had gotten pine nut oil on it which she is deathly allergic too accidentally 6 years ago.

The host Justine was just the sweetest little pregnant girl was really nice got us a table within 10 min of putting our name down. 1st part of great customer service. We decided we were going to play cards against humanity our server Chris came by and was awesome by the way coolest server ever we delt him a hand and as busy as he was with others still made time to deal with us as well. His recommendations were spot on drinks and food couldn't recommend a better server. Ohh and a shout out to Gary his manager who played a card with us.

(Rated 1\5) Drinks: I ordered the Lemon Drop and I must admit that I enjoyed it! for the pricing it was decent. I was also able to taste the Strawberry Mojito and found that to be very good as well!

Our waitress was amazing and humorous as well.        For starters I ordered a severed ahi tuna salad and Hawaiian flatbread pizza. The portions were quite generous and there was enough food to share with our group. My salad was huge and the dressing was sweet with every bite. The tuna was placed to the side and topped off with a slice of avocado. As for the Hawaiian pizza the portion was overwhelming and sliced in small squares easy for sharing with our group. Had a blast and drank a few. Big downer was the bill, although everything was reasonably priced, I however wasn't reasonable with my wallet.

She said they would take it of our order and that the entrees would come out shortly. We insisted to still get our appetizer and asked to bring them prior to bringing out the entrees. About 10 minutes later our entrees were served and to my surprise there was a Mentos (see uploaded picture) in between my fries. They took back my plate and brought out the entree on another plate 5 min later. The burger and fries were cold so they probably just changed plates and removed the Mentos.

My thoughts, train your staff better.  We don't want a free meal coupon for the future. Its not a hoax, check your ""to go"" checks between 1:00 and 2:00 for today initials AY ordered a burger I believe.   Eating out is more about the experience most of the time.  One can make better food at home in most cases, unless the restaurant is very high end.  People go out to celebrate, to treat themselves, to enjoy the special service, atmosphere and decoration and yes sometimes just to eat.

Angela B.,"San Mateo, CA",106,146,5,1.0,8/3/2016,"I sent this email almost on 07/13/2016 with no response; not even an apology.  Good Evening,  I have spent the last few days debating on whether or not to send you an email about the behavior of your manager as well as the waiter at the San Mateo location, but with a lot of thought I think its best you know of a situation that happened last week; 07/08/2016 - 645pm My friend and I came in for dinner, sat promptly at a table in the bar and was greeted by Andrew N. who took our drink order, as well as our food order (which included an appetizer)  I was very clear as to what I wanted, the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer (happy hour was ending in a few minutes so we wanted to put that order in)  I also wanted the fish tacos with no sauce and guacamole on the side, my friend a salad with ranch and the spaghetti with meatballs - didn't sound or seem too difficult.  My friends salad arrived, and it didn't have any dressing on it so we asked the bus person to please bring some, and they did so without hesitation.  Our dinner then arrives, not our appetizer but our dinner. I first comment on that to the bus person and they go over to Andrew who then comes over to tell me that he did not put our appetizer order in and that it is passed happy hour time and the discount would have to be applied manually - all things neither of us really cared to know. But then I look down and my fish tacos are covered in the avocado and mayo sauce, I probably would have got over it and scraped the sauce off had the fish and the shrimp not been cold. But they were cold, ice cold actually.  I ask Andrew to get me a new order, and I know its not great being told something is messed up and I also know that having a customer complain is never a good thing.  About 15 minutes go by, it shouldn't take that long to make shrimp or fish - but I get it the restaurant is busy its dinner time so I let a few more minutes go by. The waiter brings my food over himself, and I immediately caught this horrible whiff of something sour and pungent - old fish is exactly what it was. The people next to us even made a comment about the smell.  I then asked for the manager, as this was now an issue. My friend had, had her meal now for over 20 minutes and was politely waiting on me to get my meal.  The manager comes over after about 7 minutes with another plate of food - I went over to touch it and he yanked the plate away and told me not to touch it. I found this to be odd, I am a paying customer I can and will do as I see fit to the meal you're supposed to be serving me. I told him how frustrated I was, and he stood there shaking like a leaf and told me ""I will take it off the bill if thats all you want""  But really, that wasn't all I wanted, i wanted to eat dinner - enjoy my time with my friend and possibly have dessert. But he was so rude and unprofessional I was in complete shock.  The bill then comes, and there it was the fish tacos no discount taken and the chicken lettuce cups.  I point this out to the waiter, who then sends the manager over - again. Shaking like a leaf, I explain to him our issues and what brought us to this point and that being in hospitality he has to suck it up and deal with all kinds of people - regardless of attitude or tone he needed to hear me out before walking away from someone.  He still shaking - with a very condescending tone asks what it is that I want, and I told him that I want the meal and the chicken lettuce wraps taken off the bill and that I would like to pay - but not before getting the general managers information.  His tone then changes, did he think I was not wise enough to know someone was above him? Did he think I was going to let this one go? I have always been pleased with the food and service I receive from this location so to be spoken to or treated otherwise was a bit of a shock - hence my delay in even sending this email.  When he comes over, after my friend and I had paid - he says he's going to take care of everything - now this threw me off. He saw that we paid, saw that my card was already handed back to me - yet he now all of a sudden is going to take care of our bill. It just didnt make sense to me or my friend at all.  I dont know what happens to managers that treat customers horribly, but I do know that being in human resources that if ever one of my representatives of the company I work for spoke to someone the way I was spoken to I would have been sure to not only give them a written warning but to probably put them on a final warning.  Now, as far as how you all handle things is up to you - but I can not see myself going to this location in the evening again knowing he was or will be there and with the possibility of him recognizing me and doing who knows what to my meal, drink, dessert or check. I know you're going to reassure me that things that I am imagining dont happen - but lets be honest here.

The ahi poke appetizer is  A LOT LESS in quantity and less tasty. I always have to ask for extra sauce on the side. This goes for both San Bruno and Foster City locations (except tonight, my extra sauce never came!). I also noticed that the spinach artichoke dip is not as dense as before. Seems very light and almost ""whippy."" Still okay, but not as good. Ordered the sliders and the presentation was not at all appealing to the naked eye. The mini burgers just looked like it was prepared in a hurry with cracks and fingerprint indentations on the top bread (like it was slapped on). To top it off, one of the sliders' meat was about the size of a quarter (okay, slightly bigger than a quarter). I wanted to express this to our server, but hesitated. She must've noticed and expressed our concerned looks to the Manager, because he came up to our table to ask what was wrong and how he could be of help. I just explained how tiny the meat was on one of the sliders and he apologized and offered to give us free dessert, which was pretty awesome (had the pizookie, of course!). Despite of, I still gave it 3 because the Manager did express his apologies and gave us a free dessert, which makes me think that he will have a ""talk"" with the slider preparers in the kitchen (maybe be more strict about consistency).

Skinny fries were pretty killer. My co-worker got a flat bread pizza thing and it looked pretty standard. Albeit kinda greasy. Second trip was for a later dinner after tearing down the booth. Apparently others had the same idea and the place was pretty packed for a Sunday night around 8:30. Started with a BJ's Berry Jack Lemonade - not a fan. Too much sweet/sour - weird after taste.

Some of the others ordered their own dishes but I only at the calamari appetizer and the pizza.  The calamari was okay. Not very flavorful so very dependent on the sauces (tartar and marinara) which were both also not very good. Lemon, pepper, and salt  was the best combo for me.  The pizza was very big but was ultimately not a deep dish pizza. More like a large, puffy, cheesy, bread stick with special toppings. Chicken was dry, buffalo sauce was kinda sour. Very spicy but that might be me.  Our waiter was not very attentive at that time. We had to remind him to take our plates and refill our cups. Overall, bad at checking up on our table.  Overall, meh.

I have just moved to a new city halfway across the country and had a really long birthday with none of my close friends or family here to celebrate with. I had some errands to do in Bridgepointe park when I stumbled into BJ's and was welcomed in like a regular. The bartender was incredibly kind and made me feel really happy to be there. I ordered some calamari and potato wedges with some wine (such a weird combination, but hey, it was my birthday). He told me not to leave quite yet as he had a surprise for me and a few minutes later he came out with a birthday Cookies n' Cream Pizookie. Beyond the fact that everything I ate and drank there was bonafide delicious, I can't tell you how kind and sweet this gesture was after moving all the way here from Vermont and not knowing anyone in the area yet.

Diane B.,"Moss Beach, CA",274,324,515,2.0,11/8/2014,"What was I thinking?  Too much Costco shopping; I think it got my consumer radar off, and yes, I went to BJ's.  I used to meet my friend who worked nearby, but hadn't been here for quite awhile.  They used to have good soups and salads.  It was soooooooooooooo noisy in here... help. So I got the salad and 1/2 sandwich, which seemed like a good deal, but the sandwich options were pretty limited.  I got the ""new"" pesto chicken with a Caesar salad.  It includes fries, either steak fries or skinny ones.  I choice skinny. Already a bit cranky from the noise and the wait to be seated, I'm afraid it all made me focus on the negative.  So many different service people I can't figure out who my real waiter is. Strike 1: My 1/2 sandwich arrives with steak fries.  Since the guy who brought it wasn't the one who took my order, I decide to remain quiet about this. Strike 2:  Where's my salad?  Arrives about 5 minutes later.  Looks very tired. Strike 3:  Details, but important - The lettuce in the salad looked like it had been purchased already cut up, like what you get in  those bags at the grocery store, with lots of soggy blackened pieces like the ones in my picture.  The sandwich was made with the bread slices arranged upside down from each other so they weren't the same shape.   This meant that the all the contents around the edges fell out as I tried to eat it. BJ's, You're Out! The waitress who originally took my order did come by and noticed I had the wrong fries and offered to bring some skinny ones.  I declined.  She apologized, and I appreciate that.  Will not be returning any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=120

The menu is gigantic, the beer choices are plentiful, the place was packed at 6:30 on a  Friday night. We had three entrees, a house salad, two beers, and a cider for $61. Very reasonable. Our food choices were a Thai Mango Avocado Salad for $12.50, a Margherita Flatbread ($9.75), and a Honey Lime Scallops ( from the calorie friendly ""Enlightened Entrees"" menu) for $13.95. The scallops were listed as 370 calories, so I was expecting a small plate, but man was I wrong. It was six big scallops, a modest portion of rice, and a huge serving of asparagus.

This review is about my experience on one specific day, 10/31/15 at the host counter. We walked in around 1:15-1:30 and there was no one waiting to be seated so we walked up to the counter. There were two employees having a discussion about a customer that they just seated at their table. As we approached the counter, the male employee (wearing white contact lenses, it was Halloween) looked up at us out of the corner of his eye and continued his conversation for a few more sentences. Then greeted us with a simple ""Hi"" and nothing else. We asked for a table for two and he walked away from the counter, then looked back at us and said, ""Follow me, Ill find you your table.""  Does that mean we're going on a search for a table?  He then walked us to our table, set the menus down and said something to the effect of ""here you go"" (I don't remember the exact phrase/quote).  Our waiter was busy, but attentive and apologetic for being busy and took our orders pretty quickly and brought our drinks out almost immediately.  Our overall service was good, as expected.  I did notice the same host continually leaving the host counter unattended while people came in, and even saw one party leave after standing up there for a few minutes with no one to greet them. Meanwhile the host was over by one of the server stations chatting with one of the female servers who kept trying to end the conversation to get back to work, and she even asked if he was on his break, and he said he wasn't. The entire time he was at work, he had an extremely stern scowl on his face.

Mirabelle T.,"Seattle, WA",20,5,,1.0,8/17/2015,"I would actually give this place 0 stars considering my first experience was pretty terrible. But I thought I should give it a second chance. But no, BJ's brewery & restaurant failed again! Long waits on a Monday evening, even when there were many open tables. So we took a table outside thinking it would be faster. That was ridiculous because when the host brought us to the table, it wasn't clean. He told us to wait. So we waited, & no one came to clean it. Then my sister went to ask the host again, and still no one came out. So finally, I went to the manager who clearly doesn't have managerial skills or communication skills in leading his team on how to effectively run the restaurant on a Monday night at 8:15pm!!!  Finally, we sat down, we waited to order. Then we waited again for the food. Finally at 9:40pm we got our food. We waited so long for mediocre food. Not to mention, the waitress forgot my husband's drink order & place setting for the children. She seemed like a nice person, but a little scattered.  I would like to say maybe this was an off night. But this is my second time at BJ's Brewery & Restaurant and it will be my last & I will not recommended it ever.

The first overlook that I should've heeded to was when we were seated without menus. Our server came 15 minutes later asking if he could get us anything and noticed that we had silverware, but no menus. He even addressed that and said why weren't you given menus when you were seated? You have silverware but no menus, that's weird. We proceeded to order shortly after. I inquired if I could do sweet potato fries instead of regular and our waiter said yes. For what seems to be 45 mins for two small orders, we finally receive our food from one of the staff coming from the kitchen. My bf notices that my order wasn't correct and told the person dropping off the food that this isn't what I ordered. The worker ignored our red flag and walked away scoffing ""Ooookkk"". At this point we were ready to leave. Our initial waiter comes back to check on us. When we tell him the fries are wrong he indicates that all he heard was fries and they don't serve sweet potato fries at BJs, and I quote ""Ooookkkkk"".

BJ's has a brunch menu on the weekends until 1pm, but I was more in the mood for lunch food, so I ask our server if we could order off the lunch menu (which is stated as m-f on the menu). He said it would be ok so I ordered the half sandwich and soup combo, which also came with French fries.  I had the turkey bacon ham, which is grilled with cheese, lettuce and tomato. The sandwich was a bit dry, but I did ask for mayo. There was a large helping of fries, and the Caesar salad was larger than I expected. All for $8.50!

Our server was friendly, but it took forever to get our food, our drinks, our silverware... well it just took some time so prepare to be patient. There aren't too many options to choose from for vegans but I got the brussels sprouts salad without cheese. I asked them to replace the cheese with avocado (assuming it would be an even exchange for avocado for goat cheese) and they charged me $2 for about a half an avocado.

The manager did come over and apologize for the miscommunication but after reading all these reviews I see it wasn't a one time mistake.  I give them one last chance with ordering a Pazooki now by this time it's over an hour later since I first sat down.

Amanda R.,"Coarsegold, CA",41,2,,2.0,6/17/2017,"I first want to start by saying that I was really happy that I was staying next to a BJ's when I came to town on business. The first night I went we had a waiter that seemed that he had been through some things since it was visible, looking past that. It seemed he was not very attentive he would be gone for long periods of time, not refilling drinks etc. but when he was being attentive I felt like more of an inconvenience to him then a guest. He did separate our checks which I appreciated considering what happened the second time I went. It was a terrible an experience but we decided to try it again. This time we got another waiter, she was very nice at first. Refilled our waters, was attentive unlike the first one. As the night went on, my friend was still eating. The waitress proceeded to take the plate even though my friend told her she was not done. She then brought us our check and I kindly asked her to separate them, she then replied that she couldn't do that. We were a little surprised by this but we looked past it. So we intended to just give her all our payment methods, but it seemed like she still did not want to do that. That only one of us should pay the meal. She asked a question about the taxes, but we weren't sure since we are from out of town. As she just stood there glaring at us, because we were weren't sure what she wanted from us. I'm giving it two stars solely on the fact the food is so good.

Claire W.,"San Rafael, CA",940,436,2520,3.0,3/14/2012,"Went there for a work luncheon today and tried: Gourmet Mac & Cheese on the snacks and small bites menu - maybe Mac & Cheese is just not my thing; I was not very impressed with it as the pasta did not taste cheesy at all; rather, it was sort of oily, even though the menu says three cheeses. I guess I was expecting the melt, stringy cheese, not the oily kind. I did taste the garlic but not chipotle as stated on the menu. The bacon bites were a good touch but the pasta did not have the crispy crust on the top as stated on the menu ""oven baked to crispy"". I think maybe the execution or ingredients were a little off? One of my coworkers had the caesar salad with grilled chicken. He orders this dish all the time. I can see why. The portion of the greens (not just ramaine lettus) is huge and there is generous portion of grilled chicken. Looks like a very simple yet satisfying dish. Hawaiian Mahi Mahi - fish portion is good (not huge), but flavor was lacking and very bland and a little on the dry side. The pineapple fried rice was also not impressive; a little oily and the rice was a bit hard. I prefer the rice to be soft and starchy instead of not cooked all the way through like this. Even though the menus says that it is under 600 calories I will not order this dish again! I just don't think healthier or lighter dishes need to taste so bland!

I never had bad experiences, but just nothing memorable that would make me return neither, and this BJ holds the same ground. Me and the Boyfriend was looking into trying something new. We never explored San Mateo (or more like, never gave it a chance), so he decided BJ's would be a great start for food exploration. LOCATION: The restaurant is fairly easy to locate (it may be easy if I followed my GPS, but the Boyfriend fancied himself a good navigator; we took a few extra turns and blocks to get here). If you've been to a BJ before then you know this restaurant looks as if they have a ginormous ceiling from the outside. You can't miss it. It's well lit with LED lighting and a easy on the eyes but attractive yellows and oranges painted on the exterior. A color that says ""we're fun, come in!"" PARKING: Definitely not an issue, and it shouldn't be (accept for Oakridge area). We came here on a Tuesday early evening, so there was plenty of parking spots. ENTRY: We were greeted by two(2) young ladies at the front (how unfortunate, they didn't smile - tsk tsk tsk). Once we told them ""party for two(2)"", they had a young gentlemen seat us. INTERIOR: There is certainly a lot going on for the interior. From colors, to light fixtures, to photos to artworks. It makes waiting for your food not so long (unfortunately for both parties that was sitting on both sides of us -they had not so happy experience -one waited over an hour for their food and the other didn't touch their food). SERVICE: The experience upon our entry can definitely improve with more eye contact and smile -definitely would help (someone re-train these kids the basics of customer service). Our waiter was pleasant and professional. He was probably the best customer service we've had the entire time there (sorry, I don't remember your name and I don't have the receipt that might have your name on it). Our food came out on a pretty decent time. FOOD: We ordered several snacks and appetizers to have a bit of variety. Incredibly disappointed. Out of all the selection of the Appetizer Combo, the only thing that had flavor was the spinach and artichoke dip. The rest was surprisingly bland (how can mozzarella sticks be bland?). The California club, Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, Grilled Chicken club was bland. I guess this restaurant is more of a sports bar than a restaurant (get drunk and you wouldn't care what the food tastes like) at least the food presentation was pretty.

His looked a bit darker than medium rare in comparison to mine but was also about a half an inch thicker than my cut. Further, their side dish portions left something to be desired when a side of broccoli was about 5 spears lol.  In terms of the service, the waitstaff was nice. However, it did appear as if maybe they were over worked as our waitress was a bit forgetful as a result. It also seemed as if they didn't want to completely utilize their restaurant space as it felt like my party as well as other parties, were confined to a small area near the entrance and bar.  Aside from all of that, the restaurant itself is family friendly as they do offer a kids meal. They have a full bar and TV's that play different sporting events. Parking isn't an issue as they are in a shopping center with a huge lot. All in all, its a good place to stop off and grab a bite if you aren't looking for anything with that non-chain restaurant wow factor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=40

Lavinia J.,"San Mateo, CA",118,8,14,5.0,9/23/2017,"*****UPDATE REVIEW***** Tonight we (my sisters and I) were invited back to BJs for a ""do over"" of my birthday dinner by the GM of this location. I have to say that from the moment we arrived til the moment we walked out, we were escorted to our table by Gary (GM) who literally stopped the traffic of workers so that we could get to our table. They had birthday balloons at our table and he even allowed us to order whatever we wanted. Not only did the GM apologize for the last experience we had there but he served us personally and made sure we had everything we ordered and asked for. Our other server Steven was just as great and even went out of his way to make sure we had a great (birthday) dinner. At the end of the night they brought out a huge chocolate birthday cake for me. That was very sweet. They even gave us gift cards. Thank you Gary, for making this a wonderful experience. I appreciate this so much because I was feeling sad being that this was a place that we always enjoyed coming to with lots of family. I am happy customer once again. Thank you! P.S. My steak was perfect.  My family and I frequent this location and Im very sad to say that I had THE worst experience ever on Sunday 9/17/17! My sisters & SIL's took me out to dinner for my birthday here and we received the worst service EVER! Our waitress was new so we tried our best to keep that in mind but it was one thing after another. Between her and the cooks, everything went wrong. I ordered a Root Beer Float and she brought me Root Beer. I flagged her down to tell her I ordered a RBF and she looked at me and said ""Yes"" with a nod. I then asked where the ice cream was and she paused and with a puzzled look on her face said ""Oh, Sorry"". Everything just went downhill from there. My steak was supposed to be medium well and it came ""well done"", charred and dry. My sister got a completely different burger from what she asked for and when she finally got it, it was missing the gravy altogether. My other sister ordered sauce for her meal and her food got very cold after waiting for at least 10 minutes... she ended up NOT eating it. My Sister in law ordered 2 appetizers as her main meal and only got one. By the time she had flagged someone down (at least 20 minutes after her 1 appetizer arrived) she didn't want it anymore. There was also a trio appetizer that was never fully (only 1/3 made it to table) brought out. By the time the other 2 parts of trio came the other one was cold as hell. It was bizarre. Our waitress was often standing nearby fidgeting with her server tablet. And not really tending to our table or the many issues we were having. A manager comped the food some of the food errors but at the end of the night we paid a split tab on 2 separate cards. The next day it turns out they double charged us for our dinner. What a joke. Get it together people. Thank God a friendly server ""Treyana"" kinda helped us. We hope this NEVER happens again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=40

Lee D.,"Green Bay, WI",25,125,90,4.0,10/4/2017,"We ate at two locations of this chain during our time in California. The first time, I didn't know what to expect as pub food is not my favorite and that was what I anticipated. I was pleasantly surprised to see multiple salad and other vegetarian options as well a statement in the (book like) menu that stated that many other menu items could potentially be prepared to be vegetarian. I had the vegan lentil and ancient grain soup both times and it was very satisfying. The first time I had one of the salads (sorry, can't remember the name but it had baby kale, blueberries and roasted Brussel sprouts) and it was quite tasty. On the second visit, I had the cauliflower tacos and they were very good. I didn't care very much for the side of seasonal grains that came with the tacos (might have been better if it was warm and not cold). There are three options of unsweetened iced tea as well as (duh!) many beer selections. Our first visit was to the San Mateo location and my mother in law, whose name is BJ, asked if there were t-shirts for sale. The manager came out with a t-shirt and gave it to her, saying she had never met anyone named BJ! (these are the t-shirts that the wait staff wear). Today we ate at the Tanforan location; it was rather noisy and crowded inside (there was a wait even at 1:30pm) and we were offered a table in the mall ""patio"". This is covered and MUCH quieter but I would not recommend sitting at the first table since every time someone opened the mall door, the breeze would hit us and the doors slammed shut, making a lot of noise. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised both times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=40
Juliet V.,"San Mateo, CA",141,2,,1.0,12/2/2017,"I looooove this restaurant and I can't believe I'm writing this review but my experience last night was awful! Bj's is usually my go to spot for family dinners and last night my family and I went to BJ's after my sisters school event at CSM. I came in with my family around 9pm (7 adults and two kids + nb) we order our food and it took a little longer than usual. Mind you I'm a regular at Bj's. A party of 15 sat down next to us 25 mins after our arrival and they received their food before us. When we finally got our food, 6 out of 7 meals were cold partially warm and my pizza was soggy. Food tasted warmed up from a microwave. This was absolutely disappointing! We immediately got the MOD attention because our waiter was no where to be found and he reassured us that they would have the kitchen re cook all our food in 25 mins. We turned down the offer and he waived the entire bill (duh! Why would I pay for crappy food) and told us we could order any dessert on the menu on the house. MOD ended up getting my 5 year old a fresh plate of spaghetti that was steamy hot. Here's my point is, why did i have to complain to get fresh cooked food? Shouldn't the restaurant serve fresh cooked food regardless?? We ended up eating our pazookies and leaving. MOD Never came back to check on us, i walked out the door with my family and he was standing in the foyer area talking to our waiter and didn't say anything to me or my family. Bj's you disappointed a loyal customer and i hope your other customers aren't treated with lousy service like my family did. I wish i took photos of the crappy food we were served and expected to eat  free pazookies was cool but i didn't come to Bj's to eat free pazookies! My family was expecting a nice fresh meal.

So my boyfriend and daughter order there food first and then 2 minutes after I order mines. The waiter Did notify me about it might come couple minutes after their food which is fine.  But they were done already with their food and my burger still wasn't  out? So then I had to cancel it... we ordered the potato skins. It was so crispy and crunchy (not pose to be like that) and no effort what so ever most of the bacon pieces was on the plate then the potato it self. I order this plenty times and never had it like that and it was disgusting at this place !

We were really hungry and it took forever for us to get our food. When we did get our food, it had to be sent back because they brought out a chicken pizza instead of a veggie pizza. They took the pizza back and brought us our veggie pizza after 40 mins. I feel as though the staff here is short handed and they definitely need to hire more employees for a busy place like this. The waitress was over worked and was waiting way too many tables at once so it wasn't her fault that she kept forgetting what we had asked for and mixing up our orders with other tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=40
Chad Y.,"Dublin, CA",2,36,39,4.0,11/7/2016,"If you've been to a bj's before you can expect more of the same here. What keeps us coming back? The pizza/pazookie.  Our personal favorite is the bj's favorite which is a nice deep dish with sausage, peppers, onion, tomato, mushrooms, and olives. This location's in particular had a great crust, soft enough for easy chewing but still had a nice crunch!  The pazookies here have always been my favorite simply because they were the first place I ever had one (or even heard of one). The secret strategy is to move the ice cream around so the center of the cookie doesn't get too cold.  They did dim the lights around 8 when we were here for dinner so if your sight is poor in dim lighting be prepared.  Screens abound with varying different games on so this is a great spot for those trying to watch the game.

Our waiter gave the wrong drinks to people and then suggested we switch them after they had already been drank.

That said though, this BJ's location is ALWAYS crowded. This always surprises me too because there are lots of other good restaurants in Foster City and San Mateo. But hey, don't be discouraged. You can skip the line if you sit in the bar area (and let's be honest, you're gonna get the beer here anyways) and can find an open seat.  The food here is just like any other BJ's. The menu is long with lots of appetizers and beer choices. I normally get the chicken pesto flatbread, but for some reason they didn't have it last time I went so I had a very greasy pepperoni flatbread.

Amanda G.,"Menlo Park, CA",833,1412,,2.0,6/11/2013,"Unfortunately, I've had to come here a few times, because family members picked it. Service is always bad, from start to finish. A reservation was made, (we had a group of 8) and we had to wait keep asking if the table was ready, each time we were told they were setting it up, and it would be ready in a few. BS,  it was almost half an hour past the res time when we were seated. Our server was pleasant, but, that's the only positive thing i can say about him. Drink orders were given, and after a VERY long time he brought them out-half of them. He forgot what everyone else had ordered, and then incorrect beverages were brought out anyway. MY FIL wanted to say something, but was unable to get the anyone's attention. The food order took a very, very long time as well. We saw some people we knew who were seated at the exact same time as us, had apps and entrees and were out in under an hour. It took us over two hours from the time we (FINALLY) got seated to the time the check was paid. My bison burger and my husband's burger came out super well done, when we both requested medium. We sent them back, mine came back cooked correctly, and in a reasonable amount of time.  I don't know what the deal was with my husband's, but his took way too long. The worst part? When he finally got it, it was still overcooked. Obviously, at this point he just ate it. He also tasted the GIL's spaghetti and meatballs, and said mine was much better, (and my version is even a healthy version!) When we got the bill, they did comp both our meals. I appreciated that, especially since we ended up eating ours after everyone else was almost done. I am continually amazed that people choose to eat here, and obviously a lot of people do, since they're often busy. There's a million great locally owned places nearby, why do people keep coming here? It's a great mystery to me....

What they really lack is one central screen. The main screen behind the bar is split in 4. When I was here for a big game, they played the game on 80% of the TVs in the joint. But it would have been actually better to see one big screen and the other games on the smaller screens.  As far as food and service goes, it's on par with the other BJ's. So I guess this makes this place a 3 star location if you know BJ's. But if you've never been to BJ's before, I actually do like this franchise.

The first BJ's I have ever been to was in LA, all we did was go to consume a pizza sized hot cookie with a mountain of ice cream. This time I attended with a much more healthy state of mind, having a garden salad with cajun shrimp.  The salad was healthy, the shrimp were deliciously buttery.   The nachos were something to behold.  Tri colored chips, ample cheese, sour cream, BJ's beer infused chili, and the kitchen sink. The bar was pretty crowded with sports fans but overall, I felt the energy to simply be that of a chain restaurant.  I have to say, the split projector screen over the bar was pretty neat though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=240

Anita L.,"Union City, CA",349,627,385,3.0,10/8/2017,"Came on a Friday night to grab a quick bite. Luckily, our group of 5 was able to find a table right away in the bar area, which is very rare. However, we didn't seem to have a server for the whole duration we were there. It seemed there was one waitress that had to cover the whole bar area on our own, and she was so busy that she didn't come and bring us menus or take our order. I think one of the managers that was passing by happened to see that we were all waiting, so she was the one that eventually came and got our order started. Once the food came out though, there was no one that checked in on us. The one waitress did come by at the end of our meal just to bring the check, but besides that, we were pretty much left on our own. Not that we needed a ton of service, but you would think that a busy restaurant like BJ's would know better and staff more people during one of the peak times.  Food was decent though, we got the spinach and artichoke dip (one of my favs), the brussel sprouts, and the avocado spring rolls to start. I ordered their pepperoni extreme flatbread and was surprised by how big it was when it came out. It was enough to fill me up for dinner as well as be enough as leftovers for my bf to eat later that night. We did want to order a Pizookie at the end, but didn't feel like flagging the waitress again, so ended up cutting the night a little short.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=20

Moana F.,"San Mateo, CA",56,5,12,5.0,9/18/2017,"I want to make it very that I am very disappointed at the service or lack there of in which I and my sister in laws received last night. We came in last night, Sunday Sept. 17, 2018 for my sister in laws birthday and the service was appalling to say the least. Our server  NIHAL was very inexperienced, unprofessional and unapologetic. While taking our orders she was distracted and didn't seem to know the proper use of her hand held ordering device. She didn't get our drinks right, she didn't order any of our appetizers correctly and none of our food was right.  When our drinks came she didn't know that your signature Root beer Float actually came with ice cream. When our appetizers came out, two thirds of the trio never came. When our food came out no one got their food at the same time and my sister in law, who's birthday we were celebrating, steak was over cooked and charred when she ordered a med- well.  Another one of our entrees was a completely different burger all together and another entree was so cold by the time her side came out that she didn't want to eat it. And while all of this was going on the appetizer that I ordered still never made it to the table nor did the 2 thirds of the trio we ordered. We sent the wrong burger back just to get the right burger with missing ingredients and poor preparation. For an example, the chicken burger was supposed to have gravy and none was found on it. The same burger was ordered without avocados and they were still in the burger and to top it off, the end of the tomato was put in the burger. The part that you cut and throw away with the black, where the vine connects to the tomato. We then asked for a side of mayo and when it was brought out to us the server who brought it said ""I'm sorry the mayo was sitting next to the pesto so it got in the mayo, is that ok?"" By then We had given up hope for a nice birthday dinner. We asked for the manager Max during this whole mess,  who was the shift manager for the evening shift at this location and he provided little help. Even with him present the entrees were still wrong or messed up. He decided compliment some of the meals that were a mess or never came or never came out at all but his body language and attitude by the end of our experience made the evening just an all around fail. And in the end we never got an apology from NIHAL and the manager MAX avoided us completely. I am writing because we actually frequent this location and have never in the years we've visited here and many of your other locations, had such a bad experience. I hope that this reaches someone whole can properly address this issue and hopefully train some of your staff on the proper serving etiquette in which you train your staff to have. Update:  I am so happy to finally do this update. The day after I posted this and emailed the company I got a very unexcpect call for the GM Gary, who then offered to comp our entire meal and then redo the entire experience all together. That following Friday the 22nd of Sept the same group of us returned to this location and was greeted my the GM himself and seated a table which had birthday balloons for my SIL. The entire evening was amazing and I'm so grateful that Gary reached out and took care of that situation. It was one of the best dinners we've had there and the service was just as great as it normally is!

Not only that, people who came after us were seated while we were still outside waiting. What a joke. I love BJs but I was really disappointed in this location. I waited until after eating to post this to see if things got better. The waitress helped to turn things around, she was really nice and patient, I noticed a lot of other reviews complained about the attitudes of the servers. Unfortunately I forgot to catch her name. The food was good and didn't take too long to come out, no problems with sanitation. My biggest issue was the fact that we made reservations and still waited 30 minutes to be seated.

Erika G.,"Oakland, CA",0,39,11,1.0,2/22/2016,"Terrible customer service! The food is good, but the staff is horrible. Went in on a Friday night and called to put my name on the list. I was told it would be 20-30 min. When I arrived the restaurant was packed. I go to check in and I was told my name was NOT on the list. I showed the guy my call log showing the call to them. I'm told that he will shorten my wait time. Well everyone who was already there is getting sat down. Even people who arrived after I did were sat! So I go up and ask if my wait time had been shortened. I am told I was next to be seated. Now on to the terrible service by the waiter! There is a large group of about 10 people to my side. The waiter comes over takes our drink order. He was friendly and almost a bit flirty. Young, tall, with a beard. (Didn't catch his name). Well we ordered a mojito and a beer, which took forever to come out. Ordered potato skins as an appetizer, and someone else brought it out. I needed ketchup and the waiter never came to ask if we needed anything. Had to eat potatoes without ketchup. Food took a long time to come out too!! Ordered a pizza and some pasta. Well ONCE AGAIN someone else brought out the food. I was told at the Fremont bjs that they are supposed to serve the first slice of pizza to you, which they didn't even offer. I asked the guy if he could bring cheese and pepper for the pizza. Well, I waited and waited and nothing!!!! Yet I saw him bringing out food to the large party by us, made eye contact with him and I never received the cheese and pepper. Well I had a slice of pizza w out the cheese and pepper, at which the pizza had already gotten cold. We were out of drinks and my boyfriend had already finished his meal. Then the waiter FINALLY comes to us and asks him if he wants another beer (he had not come to our table since he brought out our drinks) I ask him for more water and told him I had been waiting for the cheese and pepper since the food had been brought out. He brought it out quickly and didn't apologize. At that point we asked for a box and the check.  He brings out the check without the little notebook thing. When he goes to pick up the card and receipt he just walks past up doesn't say a word and picks it up. When he brings back the card and receipt for us to sign he DOESNT even SAY THANK YOU!!! Just places the receipt and card on table and walks away. Terrible service! Never offered us if we wanted desert or anything!!! We usually go to this bjs instead of the one in Fremont which is closer to us. But this is by far the WORST service I have ever had at Bj's. If I could give them half a star I would.

Note that I just stayed because it was his birthday and I wasn't going to destroy it because of lack of manners or someone's terrible ethics. I was hardly recognized by the waiter, when I walked in to allow a table. Nothing. If she was having a bad day and could not suck it up, whatever. Later on while we were outside waiting, my cousin (being the optimistic, foolish guy he is) says something along the lines of ""oh she must think I'm adorable"" jokingly. I look over and it is that same girl with the attitude staring at us. It really felt like a high school exchange. I called after my 24 hour shift two days after the event. Requested to speak to a supervisor because it was definitely uncalled for, regarding what occurred. No one called back. Thanks for the direction of that BJ. Actually professional. The kicker? I think it is pretty absurd for anyone to have this behaviour, especially when the customer has done NOTHING wrong and nothing to you. There are lots of other people who work through and can suck up whatever they're going and actually be grateful for a job and show it. I have been spit at/on, attacked, had I was yelled at by every obscenity, whatever you'll be able to think of on the job, and you understand what? I still suck it up and do my job because that's what I was hired to do. Not behave like an immature brat for no reason in any way.

When we arrived they were absolutely crushed.  There were people packed inside the entrance and people spilling out the door waiting for a table.  I figured we would surely be waiting for hours.  When I checked in with the hostess she was super nice and said it would only be about 20 minutes.  I was still skeptical (yes I'm a pessimist) but took the pager and tried to stay out of the way.  After about 10 mins our table was ready!  I was totally shocked. The service from the waiter was ok especially considering how many people we were although he was definitely a bit frazzled.  The food was decent as you would expect from BJs.   The only negative is it took a while to get our food and then the check.  The waiter finally brought the check without asking if other half of the table wanted dessert (which a couple of the kids did).  Yes, we could have still ordered dessert but it was getting late and we didn't want to wait.

Natalie L.,"Fremont, CA",225,38,28,5.0,7/7/2012,"MMM, good drinks and good food. Perfect way to spend my Saturday. :) I was in the area today picking up some stuff, and decided to grab some food with my mom before heading back home. We passed by BJ's and I got a craving for their delicious stuffed mushrooms, so we parked and went inside.  We were seated quickly, and our server, Jessica, was friendly, fast, and efficient. For drinks, I had a Watermelon Mojito, which was amazing...strong yet sweet- just the way I like my drinks! My mom ordered a Strawberry Lemonade and it was also pretty good.  Jessica asked us if we knew what we wanted, and I told her that we knew we wanted the mushrooms, and my mom and I were just deciding on other appetizers to go with it. She was kind enough to suggest a mini portobello pizza, and we agreed it sounded awesome as well. We also got the crispy artichoke hearts, and a tomato mozzarella salad, which we've had before, and loved. Shoot that salad....is soo good. It's simple and delicious, and I do plan to re-create it in my own kitchen, I promise you this. ;)  We were able to watch the Giants game while we snacked on our food, which arrived in a timely matter. When we finished, I confessed to my mother that I still wanted more stuffed mushrooms- so we ordered another round to go, and brought it home to share with my Grandma, too, along with some of the leftovers, which weren't much, since everything was so yummy! I really liked that Jessica was friendly, but gave us our space, as well. It was also so nice to get suggestions on menu items. I love BJ's, but sometimes the menu can be intimidating if I haven't already tried something. I am so indesicive when it comes to food sometimes, it's nice to have someone tell me, ""Hey, you might like this..."" and make the decision for me, before I change my mind eight times.  If you come here, ask for Jessica. And go on a day when you can catch a good game and drink a watermelon mojito- or even a berry cider, or a strawbeery lemonade, too! :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=360

It depends what you get. Pasta is a no-go for me here, as it was stuck together and chewy, but the parmesean crusted chicken is delicious and so is the chicken club. Burgers are good, but it's kind of hard to screw up a burger. Pizza is good but not big enough to feed entire table and is therefore overpriced. Their baked beignet (dessert) is not so good... kind of chewy and not so flavorful. It's basically hit and miss.  We went here for the Giants game one night (during post season) and informed them so, but they seated us in the far back corner with obstructed views to the tvs. My boyfriend was not too happy. Another thing is the waiters often have issues with my boyfriend's legit ID (he is turning 23) and they've also had issues with him ordering a pitcher before, getting the manager both times.

Casey T.,"Glendale, AZ",118,48,7,1.0,11/3/2013,"WORST FOOD EXPERIENCE EVER. I am so disappointed with their food and service! I was part of a party of 6 (including my 2 year old daughter) and was seated 50 minutes after arrival. When we first arrived they seemed busy so I understood the wait, but then it slowed down a lot and I assumed they were trying to catch up.  After we were finally seated, we ordered some drinks and then again waited another 15 minutes for our server to come back around and get our appetizer order.  We planned on ordering our meal right then, but one of our party members stepped out so we decided to wait until he returned. About 5 mins later he did and she was nowhere in sight.  So we waited again.  We waited for 30 minutes for this server! It wasn't even busy in the restaurant!  At this point we had barley received our appetizers. After we ordered we were confident that it would be smooth sailing from here. Far from it. After another 20 minute wait I THEN see her start to enter our order in the POS system!! I've been in the food industry for years and I know that the kitchen does not receive your order until you enter it in! I was in shock.  A good 45 minutes goes by and I asked her where our food was. She goes back to the kitchen and then almost immediately brings it out..... Guess she forgot about us?  Anyways, we all got our plates and the order was correct. I ordered ribs for myself and macaroni for my daughter. FOOD QUALITY: ONE GRADE ABOVE DOG FOOD. The ribs were very tough, bare, AND COLD!! In addition, my daughters macaroni was from a box brand that I could have bought from a mini-mart!  By the time she took it back to heat up and brought it back out, everyone was already done with their meal. At this point I lost my appetite. I ate a few strips then asked for it to go. Bill was 170 and if I had it my way she wouldn't have received a tip, but some others in the party felt bad so they gave her a few dollars.  Point is I couldn't find this girl the whole night and we waited for over 2 hours! That is unheard of! Fast forward to tonight. I came home and was hungry for a snack so I ate the BJ's left overs. Well, I should have known better by now but I didn't realize the nightmare wasn't over. I ate the left over macoroni and ribs. Last thing I ate tonight. It is now 4:00am and I have FOOD POISONING! Are you kidding me?! My body literally just rejected their nasty food.  Question everyone wants to know.... Would I ever eat there again?  I think this brief horror story says it all!

Cait W.,"San Francisco, CA",89,8,,2.0,2/26/2014,"Overall I was very disappointed by the food and service at this location.  I had heard great things about BJ's in general (with respect to the fact that it is a chain) so some co-workers and I decided to give it a try.   #1 - The waiter didn't seem to know the menu, but I cut him some slack assuming he could be new. #2 - We ordered an appetizer that had bacon in the dressing but asked for the dressing to be on the side because one of our co-workers is vegetarian. Well, it came with the dressing on the side but they still sprinkled bacon bits all over the food and plate.  We told them we wanted it remade so a vegetarian could eat it and he didn't understand why we couldn't just brush off the bacon.  If any of you are a vegetarian or have vegetarian friends you know that you can't just ""brush it off"" to make it a vegetarian dish. #3 - My pizza, which they are supposed to be known for, was EXTREMELY dry.  There was almost NO sauce on it and it took me about 5 minutes to even get ahold of the waiter to ask for a side of dressing. Our experience wasn't horrible but definitely sub par.  I don't think our office will be going back there any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=300
Jessica S.,"San Mateo, CA",78,13,,1.0,8/26/2013,"I went to BJ's on Saturday night (8/24) with one of my girl friends for dinner and drinks. The overall wait time for a table at 6pm on a Saturday wasn't bad at all (about 10 minutes).   When we got to our table we ordered drinks from the bar (I ordered the sangria and my friend ordered the peach margarita) when we got them they were very very very sweet (and i stress the VERY) and tasted like juice. Normally I wouldn't complain about such a sweet drink but this was overly sweet like my teeth HURT!  We ordered pretty quickly having come there plenty of times before, I knew what I wanted (A BBQ ranch chicken salad) and my friend ordered a (i believe its called) Thai Chicken salad. It tasted good. I enjoyed it. We even ordered a pazookie to share after our salads.  Since this BJ's is so close to the Target in Bridgepoint we decided to take a little stroll through after our meal. It wasn't even 30 minutes after eating and I felt really really sick and my friend did too! I needed to go home and QUICKLY! We got food poisioning! Bad. I'll spare you the details but I couldn't get off my toilet for at least an hour and once I did all I felt was weak and chilly. Sleeping was the only thing to make me feel better in between rushing to the bathroom.  Needless to say, I don't think I'll ever go to a BJ's again. I'm pretty sure it was the salad that made us sick because my friend and I had different drinks and even different salads but with similar ingredients (this is where we find a connection to possibly getting sick). The pazookie was cooked completely so I find no issue with it. My stomach has been in knots since then and I'm missing out on a full days pay just because of this horrible feeling in my stomach.   For that BJ's you get one (1) star from me and I'll be sure to talk to a manager whichever one will listen to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=300

We came in at 9:30pm on a Saturday night and was surprised that there was no wait ; we were seated almost immediately. Once the order was placed it took nearly 40 mins for our food to come. Upon the completion of our meals the bill was brought out without a b-day shout out to one person in our party. We notified the staff about the mix up and they said they forgot to tell our waitress. Our server brought out a pazookie, slapped it on the table, lit the candle and then walked away without even saying happy birthday. To top off the evening I took my two sons to the restroom before leaving and was disgusted at the condition of the bathroom. Paper towels spilling out from two receptacles(paper towels outside the restroom as well), floors wet and dirty, and one sink filled with soggy wet paper towels; that one employee had washed his hands and just left everything as it was. The reason I'm complaining is that there were plenty of staff on duty, and somehow all of these things were overlooked, and it wasn't as busy as I've seen in the past.

The food always tastes the same at any BJ's so no problem with that BUT at this special location, they always manage to eff it up anyway by either serving it to you cold or just forgetting about it entirely.  I don't know what it is with the management or what's going on but the service is always so SLOW. I like to say I'm a pretty patient person but the first time I was here, after 40+ minutes of not receiving our food or seeing our waiter, I wanted to just walk out. Turns out our waiter took a break and the other waiter that was supposed to take over completely forgot about us and brought us our food packaged togo for us.  The second time, they got my order wrong and I had to send it back.  The third time we sat at the bar for happy hour. I understand it was pretty busy and hectic so I didn't care too much about how long it took before we ordered... BUT it was after we ordered our food, again we were completely forgotten. We had to call his attention and ask it again after 30 minutes of watching everybody who came in after us get their food before us- he was very apologetic about it but... come on. Our beers warmed up before we got our food- and we spent one hour more than we should have.  I HATE this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=200

Jerri L.,"Burlingame, CA",48,21,14,3.0,2/16/2015,"Came here last night for Dinner, after spending an entire day of shopping. Tired, hungry and wanted to relax. Waiter Michael K took our drink orders and then we already decided to order. We are regulars at this place; therefore we knew what we wanted.  Sent in the Avocado Rolls and 2 small salads for our appetizer. Then told him our main dish is this one deep dish pizza we always order. (YUM!) I emphasized that the rolls and salads MUST COME OUT FIRST. I am not kidding you, 30 minutes passed. Drinks were empty, I'm already getting grouchy because NONE of our appetizers arrived, and I was shaking from hunger. Another waitress (not our original waiter Michael) came out and dropped off the pizza to the table. I looked at my boyfriend and said ""WTF?!"" I was livid.  He then came to our table and also gave me a look like ""WHAT!?"" and told me that that wasn't supposed happen. So I asked ""Then what the hell happened, where are the salads and our avocado rolls""  15 mins after we were done with our pizza; the salads and the rolls arrived, I almost threw it back onto his tray and said FORGET IT! We still nibbled and ate a little of each. The sweet manager Tina came over and apologized on his behalf and told me she'll take care of the rolls for us. Which was nice. He came back a little later to drop the check and made another mistake by adding another entire table's bill to our check making is WAYYY HIGHER than its actually really was. He had to take another 10 mins to fix. By then I've already had it. We paid and left. Probably not going to come back.

Others were late and sort of okay.  My most recent experience trumps all the rest.  -an 11:00am pick up apparently isn't a ""real"" option so they should completely remove it from the site and app.  - when I called to check on my order they were working on it and said closer to 1120am -at 11:20am called again but they couldn't find my order now neither under my name or order information confirmation (I ordered though app). They insisted I didn't order with them so I checked my credit card app and could already see the pending charge.  - 11:45 after my 5th call to pick up (they can't put you on hold and ask you to call back as they look into it), they finally tell me ""oh your order has been ready and it's here. Come inside and get it!"" I ordered using curbside pick up and I had to argue with them for full minute to bring out my prepaid order.  -another 10 minutes pass and they bring out a partial order which is now cold.

One thing I just can't get over is how no matter what time or day you come here it's always busy. I pass by numerous times each week and every time the car park is full with people waiting outside for their table. I feel like I'm missing something, do they have a secret topless service hidden out the back somewhere or something? Because it sure can't be for the speedy service or food. It's the kind of place I imagine you would come if you can't decide where else to eat.  The food here really is just mediocre, borderline ''ok''. A lot of which is almost certainly cooked from frozen and overpriced for the quality you get. I think the highlight of their menu is the very well known Pizookie which although nice isn't amazing either.  My husband and I came here with a coupon for one of the free Pizooki for his Birthday and as they had ran out of every flavor except for the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut ( ) that was the one we ended up with. The Ice Cream was nice but the middle of the Cookie (as others have also mentioned) was under cooked. But hey.. It's free so I can't really complain. One thing I will say is that the Cocktail selection is fairly decent and not too badly priced so coming here I would recommend taking a seat in the bar and having a few drinks with maybe a Dessert but as for a nice meal, go elsewhere. * TIP: Call ahead to reduce the wait time. * ** Birthday Tip ** Join their email club and receive a coupon for a free Pizookie for your Birthday.

Their Margaritas and Strawberry Daiquiris are also tastily mine with Whip Cream but on the Pricey side at $9.95.   We noticed that none of the Cocktails had prices on em because they are pricey, but delicious and worth the splurge once in a while.

The salad.  Ooookay, so my server listed the options for side salads and I decided to go with the special watermelon & feta.  It came, and boy was it gross.  I am normally very open to mixing sweet and salty but the feta and watermelon did not go well together.  Either that or the dressing was wrong or had gone bad, but something tasted yucky.  I tried to eat the components separately to minimize the mixing of watermelon + feta in weird dressing.  What happened here, taste-testers?? The service definitely could have been better.  Yes, I came at the end of a busy lunch rush, but it seemed like everything kind of took awhile.  I guess I was hoping for a quick lunch experience, but it's hard when there are like 200 tech people who work nearby also hoping for the same! Then, my server suggested I try a mini pizookie, so that I could have just a taste without the crazy huge serving of a normal sized one (which should be shared, for sure!).  So I picked the red velvet one, with white chocolate cream cheese chunks.  Sounded amazing.  I get my pizookie, however, and it is raw inside.  Like they had stuck it in the oven for 5 minutes to get a crust-looking top, pulled it out, and served it.  I couldn't find my server anywhere, so I sat there for several minutes waiting for her to come back.  When she checked on me, I told her it was raw.  She graciously brought another one with no complaints, but of course it had to cook for another 15 min or whatever.  So that added to my annoyance about how long everything was taking...not HER fault, but the kitchen's fault, really.  So anyway, I finally get the cooked one and it is good.  It's really ridiculously sweet though, maybe it was the chocolate chips, but geez.  It's hard to finish.  I think that's kinda true of all their pizookies though.  The mini size was great though, it was still even bigger than I'd expected.  And I didn't have to feel quite as guilty. ;) Anyway, it is not my favorite BJs.  They need to step it up quite a bit to rival most of the other BJs I've been to (La Jolla, Westwood, Laguna Beach, even Tanforan).  If you've never been to a BJs before, don't pick this one as your first stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=420

Unfortunately, I experienced below mediocre service and food.  My husband and I dined here on Monday, November 12, 2012 at around 1 PM.  We were seated after about 10 minutes and our waitress came asking if wanted any drinks or appetizers. We mentioned that we needed a couple minutes to decide on what to order. She took those ""couple"" minutes and doubled it because it didn't take us 15 minutes to decide on what to order. A couple minutes usually means 5 minutes in my opinion. We patiently waited and waited for her to return. And FINALLY, she arrives! I ordered a BJ's bacon cheeseburger and my hubby ordered broccoli and cheese soup in a bread bowl.  Service here is super slow and I couldn't seem to grasp why because the restaurant was not busy. There were several empty tables and plenty of waiters/waitresses walking around. When our food arrived after God knows how long, we were ready to dig in. My burger was ok and cooked well-done just as I requested. I could taste the char-broiled meat as I sunk my teeth in. The bacon was burnt, overcooked, and dry. I am a bacon lover and bacon -hands down- is what makes a burger so much better. This burger just did not do it for me. I've had better burgers at Red Robin and that chain is supposed to be worse.  My husband was enjoying his soup until he noticed mold on the bread cap of his bread bowl. He immediately stopped eating and informed our waitress. Her response was, ""Oh, let me tell someone."" She did not apologize. Less than 2 minutes later, a man with a blue buttoned down shirt (I'm assuming he was some sort of supervisor or manager) approached our table regarding the molded bread. He said, ""No, that doesn't look right. Would you like us to get you a new one?"" This response would have been just fine except he too did not apologize for us having been served mold.  I find it very unacceptable for a restaurant to fail at thoroughly inspecting the product(s) they serve to customers.

Sarah M.,"San Mateo, CA",13,16,2,3.0,3/18/2012,"I live about a five minute walk from this BJs. I didn't used to go here much, but since the recent demise of my ""only means of conveyance"", I have become something of a regular visitor, if only because it's the nearest bar to my house and it's easy to get to without a car.  I have mixed feelings about the place.   On the one hand, BJs is awesome - the lighting and atmosphere are maximum chill, the bar area has an above-average tv situation, their house beers are a pretty good deal at happy hour ($3/pint), and they serve some giant, triumphant nachos (nachos are my favorite) which are also a decent deal at happy hour.  Most of the non-nachos food is good, too.  My crew is particularly fond of the chicken-fried steak, the entree salads, and the (often overlooked) buffalo chicken wontons.   My FAVORITE thing about BJs is the service - BUT that's only because I always stick with my go-to server John.  John has always provided my friends and I with THE BEST customer service. I don't know about the rest of the employees, but if they are as polite, affable, and conscientious as John, then BJs is doing pretty well in a restaurant world often marred by servers that pay indifferent and/or sloppy attention to the experience of their patrons.   HOWEVER, dining at BJs is not entirely sunshine and happiness and being tickled about the groin with bluebird feathers.  It is often very crowded - there can be lines at any time, even on a weekday at 8:30pm. If you just want a burger and a beer and aren't down with waiting for a table, I'd recommend the Red Robin next door. Also, because the menu is so epic, none of the food is really THAT great.  You're not likely to get the best ""____"" you've ever had at BJs.  For the quality of the food, it's a little overpriced, especially outside of happy hour.  There are usually a lot of children there, so you will want to beware the crayon torpedoes, if you (like me) are not lookin' to tangle with these small creatures on your nights out. Anyway, I like to go to BJs for beer and snacks with my palz from time to time.  It's close by, nothing there has ever really sucked very much, and John is the best.  Ya heard?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=380

The waitress was pretty good about taking our orders quickly, but the food took forever to come out of the kitchen.  We weren't really a big group, there were just 5 of us.  Also, no one in our group ordered pizza, so I wasn't sure why the kitchen took so long to serve us. I ordered the southern fried chicken lunch special.  In the picture, the chicken fried steak looks like a big healthy portion.  When the plate came out, I was wondering, where is the rest of it?  I was ok with the small chicken fried steak portion, because it was lunch, but the photo had a plentiful platter of corn.  The corn looked like confetti on my plate that was acattered sparsely. Overall, I really like BJs.  It is a good place to grab beers, ciders, or drinks.  I think it is a good place to go if you want to relax and watch 9 innings of baseball, because the pace of the food service will probably take you to the 9th inning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=380

From Denny's to IHOP and now BJ's, chain restaurants are starting to blend in to each other with similar options on the menu and similar tastes (flavor, texture, etc). This particular time, I had the Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger with crispy-thin fries. Prior to that, I shared an Acovado Egg Rolls appetizer with my sister. The egg rolls smelled great, but I found the inside to be slightly more juicy / slimy than I had hoped for with all the avocado, sauce, and other marinated veggies. They also came in a small dish of dipping sauce which did not fit the enlarged egg rolls. Moving on to the Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger... I didn't find anything particularly unique about it. (And for the record, although I've been to this BJ's location and the Tanforan location multiple times, I have never had this burger before.) The burger was sandwiched by 2 slices of white bread which stuck me as odd, especially considering the patty itself was already thinking that a slice of bread. Added on the cheese and the rest of the burger filling and you've got a burger that barely fits in my mouth. Not bad, but like the egg rolls, too slimy for me. The big thing I got out of this experience was finally having the ability to distinguish between the tastes of chain restaurants and unique restaurants. BJ's is started to blend with its own chain stores. I need to start expanding my base of where I eat.

BJ's allows you to call in ahead of time and put your name on the wait list to avoid waiting as long, which is exactly why I called in.  Even though it wasn't a very busy night judging by the number of people waiting outside (and then the number of empty tables there were when we walked in later), I was put on hold for 10 minutes just to put my name down. When I asked the girl on the other line (the hostess) how long the wait would be she told me probably 20 minutes, which was expected. However, when we got there 20 minutes later, the hostess told me it would be another 30-35 minutes. When I told her I had my name on the list and that we were told it would be a 20 minute wait when I called in (which is why we got there later), she looked at me really annoyed, and in a really condescending tone told me that their wait times always change and she couldn't prioritize me over other people who walked in just because I had called (even though that is kind of the point of calling in and putting your name on the list).

Dave L.,"Austin, TX",3265,2340,17975,4.0,2/4/2008,"BJ's Brewhouse is primarily a west coast chain of restaurants, with one location in Ohio and a few in Florida. The location we went to had a fully stocked bar along with a dining room. For a drizzly Tuesday night, it was more crowded than I expected, but not crazily so - we were seated immediately when we arrived. A friend and I shared a BBQ chicken deep dish pizza. It was tasty, with a crunchy crust, pieces of chicken breast that weren't too dry, red onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and (according to the menu) a hickory-smoked sauce. Yummmmm. Jon, our server, was friendly and checked up on us during the meal. I was on vacation and asked for a creative, light shot and he came back with one called a brain hemorrhage, which I've never had. (That's peach schnapps, irish cream, and grenadine) It was sweet with a surprising texture. (Thanks to him, I ordered the same thing a few days later at another restaurant!)

First time here. The service we had was bad, and it wasn't even packed. There were quite a few booths near us empty. Just because 17% gratuity will automatically be calculated doesn't meant that we should get bad service. Our server was pretty much non-existent. We had to chase people down just to get our water refilled. A friend and I both got the Shrimp Scampi and when it came it was bland. Tasteless. We asked a server if we could get some more of the sauce for the pasta and he didn't get us any. We had to track down another server for that. And all we got was a small dish with tomato sauce.

We ordered an appetizer sampler and the standard calamari and both turned our alright but nothing mind-blowing. Looking at the menu for lunch, the calories are out of control.

Emily M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/12/2014,"This was my first time visiting a BJ's. The menu looked awesome, but the service was really bad. I usually roll my eyes when Yelp reviewers place a big emphasis on service at restaurants. My general philosophy is that if the food's good, service isn't that important. This place turned out to be the exception.  The restaurant was dead (we came well before the dinner rush), but the hostess took quite a bit of time to seat us. And she looked very confused and utterly terrified of people. I assumed it was her first day. Not a big deal, I know what it's like to be new at a food service job.  My boyfriend and I split the avocado egg rolls (amazing!). I ordered a Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad with dressing on the side, and my boyfriend ordered a medium bone-in New York steak.  My salad was served with the dressing mixed in. Meh, kind of a bummer, but again, not TOO huge a deal. I rarely send food back, so I just ate the salad. It was OK.  But then my boyfriend started eating his steak. It was rarer than rare - probably the least-cooked steak I have ever laid eyes on. Again, he ordered it medium.  We asked the waitress (kindly) if she could take the steak back so it could be cooked a bit longer. She asked us if we wanted the same steak cooked longer, or a new steak. We let her know we were fine with the same steak, and she took it back without another word.   Not once did the waitress apologize. Again, sometimes steak gets undercooked. It happens. But when it does, the very least the server can do is say a quick sorry.  Maybe we came at a really weird time or something, when they happened to be training all their staff at once? There's just too many great independent restaurants around here to bother going back here if it's going to be a mess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=400

While its list of desserts pales in comparison to its competitor with just as extensive a menu (if not more so), the food is comparable and the service tends to be better and more consistent. One of things I do notice when I go to these restaurants is how they take care of the kids in our party. Time and time again, TCF sends food out from the kitchen for the kids that is incredibly hot and on scalding plates. Every time we've been to BJs, they seem to be much more on top of the concept that the little ones shouldn't be given scalding food.  This trip I had the 8oz sirloin with a bowl of tortilla soup and one of their giant baked potatoes.  Everything was cooked right and tasted good. The wifey had the Balsamic Glazed Chicken, a dish she regularly gets and enjoys. The boy got a Mac n Cheese appetizer which I tried and was quite good. Em, the 3 year old had chicken strips and fries off the kids menu that she thoroughly enjoyed.  Of course a trip to BJs isn't complete without their signature Pizooki, a freshly baked chocolate cookie topped with ice cream. Of course the boy jumped all over that while the little one decided on a kids Ice cream sundae.  Even though my meal totaled a whopping 850 calories, I chose to pass on desert.

Kelley B.,"Foster City, CA",79,48,10,3.0,5/15/2011,"I have mixed feelings about this place - I love the food, beer, and TVs but I'm not a big fan of their service, as it's really a hit or miss kind of thing.  I've been to this BJs enough times to have a lot of observations to report, so I'll just make a few general points: *While their food and beer are bomb, it's really hard to find low-cal dishes.  Luckily I just saw an ad that they came out with some low-cal options so I really look forward to trying those (chicken, tilapia, pork chops all under 575 calories? Yes, please!). *Their bar area is great (albeit frequently busy) - it's a fun place to meet up with friends or to cheer on the Giants, 49ers, Sharks, or whomever else with tons of other fans. *A lot of their waiters apparently don't know how to wait on their customers when it's super busy in there.  They will be absent for long periods of time, and to top it off, I've gotten a couple different servers who've been snobby about it and then try to kiss up to you towards the end when they remember that the customers control how much tip they get. *My biggest turnoff, if you will, to this particular BJ's is that they always gyp me on my change.  Every time I pay with cash - regardless of the waiter or waitress - I don't get all of my change back.  Sometimes it's 75 cents, sometimes 40 cents, sometimes only a penny, but I'm always shorted.  The principle of the thing pisses me off, so I always make sure to ask for my change back, and they always pretend like they don't know what I'm talking about.  Really?  Are you all that bad at math?  Doesn't the cash register even do the math FOR you?  I'd prefer thinking that they're just dumb when it comes to numbers rather than the alternative: that they're taking their customers' money on purpose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=540
Isabel M.,"Redwood City, CA",18,5,,1.0,11/12/2014,I've been a BJs customer for quite a while now and it's always a hit or miss on the service. However this time I felt the service was beyond terrible. I came in and was seated very quickly. When the waiter Gustavo came around he asked us if we were ready to order. Being such a regular I always ask for the spaghetti with the spicy tomato sauce. I asked him if I could have a Shirley temple to drink and also two waters with lemons and of course like usual I asked for the spaghetti. Then he rudely said that's not in the menu. Therefore I ask for a minute to see what else I could order since I was not aware of the menu changes. He comes back with our drinks. The waters had no lemons in it and my Shirley temple tasted like carbonated water with a touch of grenadine. I put in my order and also asked if he could bring us more lemons. He passed us by 5 times and not once did he asked if we needed anything else and he still had not brought the lemons. I couldn't even tell him about my drink because he would ignore us every time he passed by. My food came out and I needed ketchup but I couldn't even ask him for that because he had not come to check on us therefore I had to ask someone else that was not our waiter if she could bring us condiments. Afterwards he still walked by without acknowledging us and at that point I felt that the service we were receiving was not right and very unpleasant. I spoke to a manager and he was quick to getting my drink fixed and asked us if we needed anything else. After eating my food the waiter rudely drops the tab without looking at us or saying thank you and walks away...

We just wanted a place to sit down and have something that's not fast food after a very long day of moving so we decided to go to BJ's. There was nobody in the front. They had at least 7 waitresses and waiters around and some of them made eye contact with us but none of them came to help us. It was uber slow. We asked two customers in front of us if they were also waiting to be seated. They said no, they were just waiting to pay and leave and suggested we go chase down somebody because ""they've been chillin' today."" We took their advice and chased down a waiter in the bar. He said it's open bar so just sit anywhere...we actually had a minor with us and nobody asked to check our IDs...oh well I guess that wasn't a bad thing for us because they closed off the dining area. After we were seated...at an unclean table, nobody came to help us still. We went up to the waiters to ask for a rag to clean our table, menus, water, and somebody to take our orders; there was a lot of waiting between all of those. When somebody finally came to take our order, we found out they were only serving appetizers and pizzas...so our vegan friend had to have french fries for dinner. Our server was...nice but kind of cocky...I'm not sure...he was smiling...or was he smirking? I guess excuse us for coming in 30 minutes before closing but I don't get establishments like that. Why say you close at 1am when what you really mean is ""we want to go home by 1am?"" Then maybe you should close at 11:30pm so you can finish serving the rest of the customers and finish your cleaning and side jobs. The food was okay. I would say better than just okay considering it's a chain restaurant. We had wings, fries, and pizzas. The wings were okay but it can be topped by Foster Farms' Hot and Spicy Wings (value and taste -wise). The fries were made right...crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They deserve props for that. I know french fries doesn't sound like a big deal but it's an utter disappointment and shock when they're not made right. I like how the pizzas were fresh and came with a lot of toppings but I think it should have more sauce. The dough and sauce and cheese and topping ratio could use some adjustment.

She forgot to bring our beer, and she broke a plate while walking in the aisle.  I sensed that this restaurant is paying its staff as cheaply as possible, and since this restaurant is surely not a cheap eating place, I began to wonder where all the money went?  after I went home, I did a little research on BJ's income statement since this is a publicly traded company.  Whoa!!  42% of this company's revenue goes to SG&A expense, meaning the corporate management was paying themselves a ton!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=540
Eric L.,"San Mateo, CA",4,5,1,1.0,10/10/2015,"Went to BJs at 10 pm and it was busy. We got a seat at the bar and service was so slow. Our waitress,  jessica was apparently really behind so another waitress helped out at our table. Jessica eventually came by but was inattentive. We had an appetizer and then got out pizookis. We must have waited 25 minutes for the pizookis and we were looking for Jessica so we can check, and she was a few tables away chatting up a storm with other customers and the bartender. By this point the bar was not that busy anymore. She saw that I was staring at her and looked away. So I stood up and walked over to her and then finally she wakes towards me and said she checked with the runner about the order. A few minutes later the pizookis came. It took a lot less time to eat it than the wait time. I had gotten a coupon for a free pizooki for my bday so it was so not worth the hassle. There is simply no excuse to take that long to get pizookis out. She was also incompetent when we asked to redeem some points/coupon on our frequent diner account. So it took even longer to sort out the bill. Overall, terrible service from Jessica.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=540

The server never came back to ask us if we needed refills, it took her 15 minutes to come back and check on us from when we got out food, and paying was so annoying given we had to ask her 3 times  for the bill. I am a server myself so I tend to understand if the service isn't on point and I see the server running around with other tables but no one helped us and we even had to flag down other servers which I personally don't really like to do but it's not like we had our server taking care of us.

Onion rings too skinny and greasy, and mashed potatoes were positively not of this world with a consistency like some food stylist's synthetic creation. The gravy was hideous and inedible.

Shannon N.,"San Jose, CA",65,800,167,2.0,8/17/2009,"They've got a deal going on right now (found out about it via email, there's no mention of it on their web site or on the menu in-store) - 2 salads/soups, a medium pizza and a pizookie for $20.  This is a steal (the pizza alone is normally $20).  So we stopped by to give it a try. Started with the garden salad and the chili. Salad was boring (iceberg and shredded carrots) - two stars there.  Chili was tasty - big chunks of meat, a little bit of heat, and a dollop of sour cream.  Four stars. Pizza - we did the combination (forget its exact name) with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms.  It's all crust.  Very little tomato, almost no cheese, just a ton of crust.  Extremely buttery crust.  Very, very disappointing - I'd been craving pizza for ages and this did *not* hit the spot.  Two stars. Pizookie - this is where it's at.  Get the ice cream on the side so it doesn't melt all over your warm cookie of love.  Four stars. Parking here is *much* better than their Cupertino location.  If you need a pizookie, go to San Mateo! Would stop by there again for the pizookie, and maybe the chili, perhaps.  But the pizza was so meh, I think I'm pushing this back down to a two star.  I would've been peeved if this meal had been full-price (closer to $40).  The pizza was such a disappointment.  Meh indeed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=500
Bowser J.,"Burlingame, CA",1,40,,2.0,1/1/2011,"I am basing this review on two visits. The first; Service was fast and friendly and the pulled pork sandwich was tasty.

Any bleak attempt of some sort of human like comment out of his mouth was awaited but only pertained to the food and his job. Way to make an enjoyable experience for people trying to go out and be somewhat fancy instead of eating fast food. He then brings the check as we're eating and has this statement prepared.

You can even enjoy some items from their ""healthier"" options menu, which if I don't mind saying are pretty tasty as well, if you can get yourself to make that lower calorie choice.

I love the new 'snacks and small bites' that you can order instead of getting one of their 'sharable appetizers' because the small bites are perfect size for something to munch on before getting your main dish but the appetizers are so big I usually get full off of those and I have no more room for my main dish. I always get the chardonnay shrimp pasta, to me it's the best dish on their menu.  The pizzas are really good too and very filling so between the two of us (boyfriend and I) we can get a small and share it and it's more than enough for us to be stuffed.

Really stupid policy of not seating the party if less then half party is there, even if the place is not that busy.  If they would have seated us, I could have ordered appetizers and drinks first, boy was I hungry.  I was tempted to going to Starbucks to pickup a muffin. I appreciate the calorie count per serving...it really helps in deciding what to order or what not to order. Service - not too swift, had to ask for refill of hot water 2 times. They did not check on drink refills until the entrees came out...they did bring out appetizers, but totally ignored all the empty glasses.  They also left the stacked used plates at the end of the table. Must be because we had larger party and an automatic 20% gratuity was added to the tab. Calamari ($9.25) - crispy and hot...love the lemon garlic aioli.  Premium Boneless Wings ($8.95)- pretty good, but we asked for Sweet Maui Teriyaki Glaze...when does ""sweet"" equate to ""a little bit of heat""...the kids were surprised for sure...my 6 year old spat it out then had to gulp down water.  They did however send out another order of BBQ wings, these were good, hope they did not charge us for it. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak ($12.25)...cannot go wrong with battered deep fried beef right?......WRONG!!!  After taking our orders, the waitress came back and said that they ran out of Chicken Fried Steak....how?  Can't they just butterfly a sirloin and pound it out...oh maybe they use Pre-Cooked Chicken Fried Steak that they drop into the deep fryer? My second choice was the Fish Taco ($10.25)...they can't go wrong with deep fried fish right....Actually I liked the tacos, you get two of them so they were really good with a slightly spicy slaw that topped it...I think it was spicy, still trying to get the ""Sweet Maui Sauce"" out of my mouth.  Note the tortilla chips that came with the dish...was shiny...a bit too much oil from the deep fryer I think. My wife ordered the Chicken Marsala.  We of course swapped plates, later on.  The chicken moist, but the Marsala sauce had no character, just tasted like a watered down mushroom sauce...very disappointing.  The noodles was just north of al dente...what I find a bit disturbing is that I found a number of twist pasta mixed in with the fettuccine...did they empty out the pasta cooker?  How long had the twist pasta been sitting there?  Bathroom is a double standee with 2 stalls.  When I went to the men's room before we were seated I found a lot of paper towels on the floor around the waste basket and some near the urinals...after dinner (about 2 hours later), the waste basket had not been emptied, there were still trash on the floor.  Note, sinks (4 of them) were all functional but the counters were wet...short kids beware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=520

Steve P.,"Redwood City, CA",62,85,,4.0,7/9/2011,"BJ's has a LOT to offer. Great drinks, great deep dish pizza, great sandwiches and more. They are wildly popular and very busy so it is likely that every now and then a Yelper is going to catch them not at their best. Many of these servers are working their first jobs so give these kids a break. The drinks...we had the Throwback Cherry  Cola (an alcoholic drink) and it was very good. The BJ's Irish Root Beer was even better. We also had a Captain's Root Beer but the BJ's Irish was better. All 3 were good, but the BJ's Irish was best. The food...they do deep dish proper with very tasty ingredients. Beats the hell out of a Costco pizza. They've got a gimmiky dessert known as a Pizzookie or something like that. It's really good, so if you have room, you should definitely get one. I'll be back to BJ's for more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=520

Adrian A.,"Redwood City, CA",91,16,,3.0,1/14/2014,"I was a little annoyed with the staff at the Tan Fran location. Called to make reservations in order to watch the Niner game. First I was told that I could make reservations, then after I tried to make my reservation they told me I couldn't because it was unfair to the walk in customers for my party to come in and be sat while they have been sitting and waiting? Either way we walked in and got on the list. When my party was called the hostess told us we couldn't sit because only half my party was their. She was so rude and her facial expressions were as if she smelled something horrible. Rudeness. Food was okay. Our waiter was really cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=520
Kasey R.,"San Francisco, CA",1,15,,1.0,7/13/2012,"When I go to BJ's (which is not often), my expectations are not very high. It's a chain restaurant that is known better for its beer and big-screen televisions than its fresh and local food, and I understand that. However, I still expect to be treated with respect and to have my party's food and beverages get to us in a timely manner.  That said, my most recent experience at BJ's has confirmed I will never be returning, except hopefully to get a refund. The service was horrible from the start, our food was mediocre (even for BJ's standards), and when we brought this to the manager's attention after the meal (I do not recall his name, but he is the overweight asian man) he was extremely rude and unaccommodating. We will be contacting his manager as a result.  So, here are the specifics as to why I will not spend money at BJ's ever again: 1. POORLY EXECUTED FOOD (which mainly consisted of FRIED dishes)  The roast beef sandwich was fine, but my blonde shrimp had been left in the flyer too long and were mostly overdone, some being burnt. The potato wedges and fish were lukewarm and had clearly been sitting at the pass for far too long. By the time we actually got this food we had actually been at the restaurant for close to an hour and did not have the time to send anything back. 2. HORRIBLE SERVICE  My party was seated in the back of the restaurant, and after over 10 minutes had still not received a hello or any water from any waiter-- even though the people next to us who had been seated AFTER US were being attended to by a waitress. One of us finally had to get up and find that waitress (I do not know her name either, but she was a younger, overweight  girl with dark hair and bangs) to ask her if she could take our drink orders. She responded NOT by simply taking out orders, but by saying she ""wasn't sure"" if she was our waitress, but she would go check. So, there we waited some more. A few minutes later, she returned and curtly said she ""would just take our order because it will be easier that way."" By that point we were ready to order drinks and food, so we gave her our complete order, which consisted of the fried blonde shrimp, fish & chips, and a roast beef sandwich-- SIMPLE food. She proceeded to take about five minutes to get back to us with water. Our food took about another 15 minutes to arrive, despite her telling us she would ""rush our order.""  Throughout the meal she never once returned to fill our water glasses, so we had to flag down a busboy. When she did bring over my husband's Jeremiah Red beer, she just dropped on the table with no eye contact and turned to help the table next to us again. When we were finished eating and the waitress was around, we hailed to her and asked for the check, which took her over 5 minutes to bring to us. We put the card in it immediately, but still after 1 minutes she had not come back to pick it up. At one point I even made eye contact with her but she still did not come over. Finally, we just decided to pay in cash and not wait for the receipt. 3. RUDE MANAGER After the meal, we went to the hostess and asked to speak with the manager. We waited almost 10 minutes and still he did not show. We almost left without speaking to him, but decided it was worth it to wait. So we waited another 6 or so minutes and he finally showed. He did not apologize for keeping us waiting. After we explained the horrible service and ridiculous mistakes with the food, he displayed no concern and said he did not have time for this. We wanted a refund, but all he would give us was a $20 gift card, as if we WANT to go back. As we were speaking with the manager, another customer came up to complain to him, but he rudely ignored the man and told the hostess to ""get another manager to deal with this.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=520

If I could give this restaurant 3&1/2 stars, I would... Pros: Not overly crowded. Pizza is excellent. Clean and modern-looking restaurant. Friendly service. Cons: Slow to be seated (even as a couple with reservations). Service is slow, especially when it comes to alcoholic drinks. Somewhat expensive. My girlfriend and I went here on a Saturday night. There were a few open tables, which I thought was a good sign because I've had to wait a long time to be seated at other very-crowded BJ's locations. But it still took us about ten minutes to be seated (minus a star right there). And then minus another half-star for how long it took our server to get our drinks out. I ordered a pale ale and my girlfriend ordered a pom punch. The pale ale was bitter, but not the face-squishing bitter, but that's to be expected. The pom punch had just the right amount of sweetness, although a bit on the light side alcohol-wise.

The food though was very pedestrian.  I should have seen it coming with the boring iceberg lettuce house salad - iceberg lettuce, carrots, and some red cabbage - you call that a salad?   Finished off with an open faced chili cheese burger which was overcome with cheese and mass produced chili.  Contrary to other reviews the service was OK but somewhat unusual in that I was brought my check while eating my entree.

Jaime L.,"Santa Monica, CA",1452,1057,137,4.0,1/29/2008,"I give them four stars for getting me drunk on multiple occasions without having to spend THAT much money...and for having friends who work there, who also worked feverishly on getting as many discounts as they possibly could on our check. Sometimes, though, I'll warn you--the service is TERRIBLE. More often than not you'll get someone who actually CARES and tah-dah! You have your food at your table, beer in your pint glass and a smile on your face followed by slurred words of happiness.  They brew their own beers, and a sampler is nice if you want to get drunk quicker. The combination of 7 different beers is a doozy ,even if you don't like some of them. I personally go for the following: A blonde, followed by a shot of Patron Silver with a taster of Hefewizen.  For food...hmm..I've tasted almost everything. I worked here. Oh, forgot to mention that part...so yeah. I know my shit. And its really, really good. Their Santa Fe Spring Rolls are delectable. Start with their Best Beginnings or a thin crust appetizer pizza (OMG THOSE ARE SO GOOD TOMATO AND BASIL MMGLORHSFHFFF). I like the following, from their menu: Jambalya. Goodness Gracious...that is so wonderful. Don't ask questions. Fucking eat it. Their pastas, pizzas, and entree selections are superb! Fish tacos...sound a little fishy to me. Kinda weird. Baked potatoes aren't super awesome, just good if you want something to fill you up with carbohydrates so you can't walk out later.  Word of advice: Get a pizookie. Not for the faint at heart, because it is magical. It comes out so gooey and hot and wonderful, you wonder where it's been all your life. Plus, whenever you order one some of the money goes towards a charity for a disease that one of the owner's daughter has.  All in all, really good place. I leave stumbling most of the time.

To begin I have to say that they are extremely over priced for the re-warmed frozen slop they serve. The beers are not what I'm looking for in a ""brewery"". The IPA left me with a nasty headache. Inevitably when you go to BJ's your server will change at least twice. It's really annoying to have the early 20's kid come over mid meal to tell you they're gonna be taking care of me. I don't care who you are just make sure my beer doesn't sit empty on the table for too long.

Their house salad is pretty good but it's missing some ingredients; namely, red onions, cheese, and more of the purple cabbage.  Since they're a brewery, you just have to try something off the list.

Steve M.,"Houston, TX",74,217,41,4.0,9/22/2009,"Came here Monday night after work to grab dinner and to watch the last half of the football game.   BJ's brews their own beers which I believe there were about 8 different brews that they offered ranging from a blonde pale ale to the darker american brown ale.  As well they have a special brew based on the time of the year.  This month they have a german lager called Oktoberfest. The food at BJ's was fantastic.  They have the standard bar foods including pizza, sandwiches, burgers, salads, pasta, etc.  The quality of the food was great and the portions are very large.   I went with the Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheese Angus Burger.  This consisted of an 8 oz. Angus burger served open-faced, smothered with Piranha Pale Ale chili, jack and cheddar cheeses and topped with onion strings alongside sliced tomatoes and pickles. It also came with the crispy-thin fries. This was definitely a sandwich that you have to use a knife and fork to eat. The only issue I had with this restaurant is that even tho they have tv's scattered all over the restaurant and all of them were showing the football game.  They had the volume turned down on the game and were playing pop music. I believe that if you are a brewhouse and you are showing a sporting event on tvs all over the restaurant, that you should also play the audio that is associated with the sporting event.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=600

I was impressed though.  Cubes of salami, at least 3 cheese, peppercinnnis and more were sprinkled through, and lettuce was probably the least used ingredient.  GOOD SALAD! the bartender was REALLY good (wish i caught her name) and I have to say the experience sitting at the bar was top notch. I've been here in the past at a table and had a lot of problems with the service (speed and following directions... 2 crucial aspects of service).  I was really glad to see this remedied at the bar.

Dominic T.,"San Francisco, CA",499,344,375,5.0,6/21/2010,"No wait on Father's Day is enough for 5 stars. Usually a wait at the Tanforan BJ's is at least 30 minutes. Upon arriving, the greeter was ecstatic and cheerful, a plus. The dining room here is smaller yet the service is even faster. Amber was the server for my party of four (including me). She was very friendly and attentive and always stopped by to check up on how everything was going. There were two mistakes in the order but it was definitely not her fault. And she brought out the free father's day pint glass after I asked, good thing there was still stock. I ordered my signature grilled chicken pasta with a root beer float and my parents both got the meatloaf sandwich while my sister got a sandwich/burger with wedge cut fries. The wait for the food was average but I wish there was some kind of complimentary starter that other chain restaurants have (e.g, bread sticks, sourdough, whole grain bread, soup, salad, etc.). I nearly finished my root beer float before the food came. I wanted to shoot myself for not bringing in my receipts for a free mozzarella sticks appetizer for completing a BJ's survey. Arg, I've been dying to use them!!! There were flat screen TVs every few feet so no one was left un-entertained by baseball or whatever was showing on the screen. My entree was not served in the big bowl-ish dish that I'm used to but a flatter one that seemed to have a smaller portion size than San Bruno serves. Still delicious but needs more flavor and much more sauce. The pasta was somewhat dry and I resorted to adding a LOT of pepper to account for the flavor loss. Throw in the stringcut fries from my sister's burger meal (that were not the wedge cut fries she ordered) and some onion strings from the meatloaf sandwich meal, and you've got a winner! Mix it up for some delicious goodness. I finished it all of course. Now for the dessert, I ordered the apple pie pizookie (the formal name for it on the menu has slipped my mind). It was VERY VERY sweet. Unless you've got a full cup of water prepared, I advise you to order any other pizookie that doesn't involve chocolate. Actually, the first pizookie that arrived at the table was the macadamia nut pizookie, which was a mistake but we didn't know until we tried it. Then later the apple pie pizookie arrived to our surprise. I actually preferred the macadamia nut one over the apple pie, though I dislike anything with nuts.  The guys bathroom is clean but really cramped.

Then a group of friends went for Monday Night Football this past Monday to watch the SF/ARI game. I was pleasantly surprised that there were a fair amount of SF fans there to cheer with :) But still a table for us to grab! The bar did fill up right after we got there.  I had been there for March madness before and it was fun then too. I like to see that someplace local has a bar you can watch sports without having to find a dive in SF. And then I ended up going back for lunch with my husband the next day! Week day lunchtime is crazy busy with all the office parks right around there. But we were able to snag a table in the bar area just as someone was leaving. I am always happy with the food I get. My only problem is with the service. It is very hit and miss. I will say if you go with just 2 or 4 people, it has always been fine. But the larger the party gets - the slower the service seems to get. And the service in the bar is much better than the main restaurant on all occasions in my experience. I've been here for lunch and dinner and the slow service in the dining room doesn't seem to have a time window. But when it was 4 of us, it was fine. A larger group - has been pretty awful.  But I will say every time we have sat in the bar area, whether 2 people or a group, the service has been good. I will definitely go back. The food is bar/chain type food but it's good for what it is. And better quality than other chains. They have a large selection of things to choose from.

It was busy that night with a bit of a wait for a table but seating in the bar area was no problem. BJ's has a decent selection of their house brewed beers which are pretty tasty. Decent coctail menu and decent regular menu. The deep dish pizza is good. Not as good of course as Zachary's or Little Star but it's pretty good. What I really love here are their chicken wings. It's not drenched in the sauce. It's more drizzled on and you can dip in the hot sauce and ranch yourself. Girlfriend and I got a couple salads and the wings and were stuffed.  The portions here are pretty big and the menu can be gluttonous. The appetizer sampler is tasty but avocado egg rolls and southwest egg rolls aren't exactly low calorie foods. But it's a brewer pub restaurant so what do you expect. The only gripe I have is the price of their drinks. Compared to an Elephant Bar and Grill the drinks are more expensive.

The food certainly isn't anything special...i think that's one of the reasons why they have such a large menu: instead of going with the business model of find a specific style of food and do it WELL, they go with the shotgun model of have a little bit of everything so that you can appeal to groups of people or people who aren't quite sure what they want to eat. I can't knock them for their model, but i must say that it shows in their quality.  I've had several different things--salads, appetizers, one of their baked potatoes--and not a single thing was really memorable, definietly nothing that i would ever order again. Nevertheless, the fact that they do have a huge menu is always a plus when one is not quite sure what they want to eat...but not much of a plus. So there it is, i don't like BJs.

Esther A.,"San Francisco, CA",645,1160,406,4.0,6/13/2006,I like BJ's despite the negative reviews on this particular location/restaurant. The pizza was yummy. I'm not a HUGE fan of thick crusted pizza (too much bread) and I never eat crusts off pizza but this one was an exception. It was buttery and soft so I ate up the crusts. The avocado rolls (a toss up between BJ's and Cheesecake Factory's) was delicious!!! I tried to save room for a Pizookie but I saw one being served next to me and it was just a plain large chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. I think I can make do w/out ordering this. OR I can make it at home if I wanted one bad enough. And the service? It was decent. No complaints here.

Good appetizers and dessert, big portions, tv's everywhere you look (for the ADD-challenged) and it's pretty conveniently located for people working in the Redwood Shores area. They get an extra star for having a good wait staff (even during the busiest of meals), one of which was kind enough to introduce this beerphobe to a beer that I ACTUALLY LIKE (gasp!)... the frambroise they have on tap is really good (it's basically a berry beer, and better than cider). Minus one star for the fact that they *are* always busy at lunch and reservations are a must if you do not want to spend half your lunch hour waiting for a table, but I must admit this is one of my favorite chains in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=640

They have plenty of TV's for you to watch a game and enjoy your drinks and food. The food was a lot better than the one in Newark and the service was much more attentive and hospitable. The burger that I ordered was decent but could have been cooked a little bit better. The fries were a little bit cooked too long and was crispier than I am used to but again not bad.

Once can't expect much from these chain restaurants since the food tends to be pretty much assembly line standard. But the people were friendly and it was an overall good dining experience. I really enjoyed 2 glasses of their raspberry iced tea. Yum.  This restaurant wasn't as big as their Milpitas/San Jose (?) location but it was still nicely decorated and clean. It's always best to go out to eat during week and not on weekends since restaurants get so crowded on Fridays and Saturdays but I know that not everyone has that time luxury.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=640

The atmosphere here was busy but I didn't feel like it was my problem. The hosts seemed rushed, stressed out & chaotic. The host taking the names couldn't speak English, yet the chick that was simply seating us did..that made no sense but, whatever I don't work there, just observing. We shared avocado rolls which are basically a big, wrap-around chip with the hugest glob of guacamole you could possibly imagine piped into it.  I had the most beautifully sculpted cob salad that was perfectly sculpted into a huge, rounded heap of uniformly bite-sized tastiness.  It was really pretty. I washed it all down with a fruity & piquant  pomegranate margarita that could not have been more perfect. I found the set up of this BJ's made more sense than the one I am used to in Lake Forest. Here, they have the sports bar very separated from the dining room. I like that a lot.  As much as I love sports bar food, I hate sports and I really don't need to see that crap when I'm trying to eat. I'd go back here in a heartbeat.

FOOD - it's a chain.  The food is fine. SERVICE - Terrible!  I ate here today with my daughter.  I ordered a salad, she ordered the mini-corn dogs off the kid's menu, and we also ordered two mini-appetizers.  They went 0 for 4; they messed up all four things!  First the entrees arrived, no appetizers in sight.  The waitress came by a few minutes later and said, ""oh!  the appetizers didn't get here first?.""  Ummm...no they didn't.  We told her to cancel those now that we had our entrees.  She came back a few minutes later and said one of them was ready and asked if we wanted them anyway and that she ""would take care of that.""  Sure.  Then the manager dropped off the other one and he also said he ""would take care of that.""  Whatever.  Anyway, I ordered my salad with no dressing.  It came smothered in dressing.  And my daughter's applesauce didn't come with a spoon (or any kid's utensils for that matter).  We eventually flagged someone down, not a big deal but strikeout number four.  The waitress was apologetic.  Then when the bill came, I was somewhat shocked to see that I was being charged for the appetizers!!  I paid the bill and when the waitress came by to pick it up, I pointed out that she did charge me for the appetizers.  I'm not entirely sure if they meant to charge me or not (what does ""take care of that"" mean anyway?), but she voided the transaction and brought me a new bill.  I paid up and caught the manager on the way out to briefly tell him how bad the service was.  He said he hoped they could do better next time.  Well, I don't think there is going to be a next time! Summary, the food is fine.  Nothing special, but you can find something for everyone here and it's going to reasonably good.  The service is lacking however.  It starts at the top and this restaurant needs a complete overhaul.  Based on the other reviews, I don't seem to be the only one who has been disappointed here.  Anyway, it was a $30 lunch, not a $300 dinner.  I've given them the yelp review they deserve and I'm over it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=660

Sure, your sandwiches kind of suck and your beer is really not that great, but as a brewery you're pretty freaking ok in my book, and it's great you're open late, and you do accommodate our giant after show parties very well. And those pizookies, man, I love your cookie goodness. But, seriously: your staff? What the hell, dude? Every time I go in it's some other freaking problem. If they're not giving me full cocktails instead of shots, they're ignoring us completely, or putting meat on pizzas for my vegetarian friends who specifically ask for them to leave it off, or generally just being surly and tossing three or four different waiters at us during the course of our meal. I mean, don't get me wrong, you have some cool bartenders, but on the whole your wait staff has really proved themselves to be inept and uncaring. So, look man. I want to hang out with you. I really do. I love spending time with your cookie bits, especially late at night. But it's always such a HASSLE, dude, and going out for a meal really shouldn't feel like an inconvenience. I wish you could be more like your sister in Cupertino. So, in conclusion: it's you, not me. Love, Nick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=660

I got to try a couple of the appetizers (crispy fried artichoke and spinach stuffed mushroom) but it wasn't much compared to their pizza! I got the BJ's favorite pizza aka, the one with the works! And baby, it worked. It was served in an iron plate making the pizza even more sizzling and hot right at your table. With its oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes, it was definitely worth the 25 minute wait for. Oh, did I mention the soft, buttery crust? I also had it with the pomegranate margarita and good company. A tall glass, very fruity, but also $10!! For that much, it could be a little bit stronger but it balanced out the meal pretty well.  I wish I had room for dessert, especially their pizzooki but I think that's enough calories for one day! I would say it's a place for a nice occasion with a very chill atmosphere. Yeah, I did stay for 4 hours. Couldn't move after all that food! Next time.. pizza buffet?

Jojo L.,"San Mateo, CA",398,70,68,1.0,9/1/2013,"On the whole, BJ's offers pretty consistent food.  I've enjoy their deep dish pizzas and happy hour beer selection a handful of times.  However this review reflects the customer service at this location (which as you can tell by my one star rating is abysmal).  I came here on a Friday evening with my family so I totally understand that Friday nights are a busy time. We did call ahead around 6:45 pm to see how long the wait was going to be and they said about 20 mins.  so We arrive around 7:10 and they hand us the beeper and again reassure us, its going to be about a 20 minute wait.  Around 30 mins in we ask if our tables almost ready and the response we get is ""Almost, we are trying to find some chairs"".   How on earth can a restaurant not have enough chairs!  We wait for another 10 minutes so 40 minutes total!  Not so happy when I'm hangry and people lie to me.  We're finally seated and it takes the waitress for ever to come by and get our drink order.  Poor girl is running around everywhere.  We put in our order (a large pizza- half spicy meatball/ half Mediterranean chicken, the appetizer party platter, a Moroccan salmon and clam chowder bread bowl).  The appetizer platter comes out pretty fast but there's no plates.... the waiter told us he was ""trying to find some"".  Ok, again BJ's was packed, I get that, BUT shouldn't the management anticipate that and kinda figure out a way to have enough plates on hand/ rewashed so that they can keep up with their capacity? I guess not bc they're short of everything at this place!! We're so hungry at this point, we just start digging into the dips and mozzarella sticks since its all finger food anyways.  Next my dad's chowder arrives but its in a BOWL not a bread bowl like we order so they have to swap it out for us. Seriously? how many things can go wrong in a given night? Luckily, the chowder was pretty delicious so it was worth it to wait.  The rest of the food arrived pretty soon after that.  The toppings on the pizza were kinda all over the the place, you could tell that the kitchen staff was in such a rush bc the the toppings from the med. chicken and spicy meatball over lapped a lot. whatever, it all ends up in your stomach, right?  The salmon was meh, would not order it again. FOOD: 3.5 stars SERVICE: .5 star ATMOSPHERE: 3 stars So, I'm not ruling BJ's out in the future completely (late night pizzokies may have something to do with another visit), I would just avoid it like the plague if I had to come during the weekends because obviously they can't deliver proper service if it's at full capacity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=440

When the pizza came I paid and hurried to the car. I put my pizza in the passenger seat, strapped the seat belt on it and rushed home. When I opened the box I was shocked to see this pitiful looking attempt at a cheese pizza. Where did it all go wrong?

My coworkers got a number of the appetizers and soups and they all came with a very nice plate display and were well received as there wasn't much left besides crumbs.

The one thing that ruffles my feathers each time I have an experience is the terribly slow service.  The waiters/waitresses mean well but always seem to go 'on break' for way more then 10 minutes and the temporary server forgets about our table.   If the management team had any clue about customer service I think it would not only help customer satisfaction out but I'm sure the restaurant would be making more as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=440

Monica T.,"Hayward, CA",0,38,1,1.0,8/24/2012,"What a HORRIBLE experience. I came here after a long day at work and just wanted to eat a nice dinner and have a pizookie.  The hostess said there was not a wait for seating outside so, being tired and hungry my boyfriend and I decided to go with that. We waited a couple minutes and were seated. The waitress came by and took our order for drinks. She didn't even know what drink my boyfriend wanted and had to look at the menu. A couple minutes later we ordered our entreés. I asked Ye waitress if I was able to add meatballs to one of the pasta dishes and she didn't know and referred me to the appetizer section to order them from there as a side-they were not an option. I just went a head and order Spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs added. Wile we were waiting, these guys (who were rude and obnoxious) decided it was okay to take their beers and pull out reserved chairs and sit blocking the exit doors to have their own loud mingle session. Seeing that I was already a little annoyed, this shot my entire mood down. One guy took out a cigarette and smoked right by everyone else why they were eating next to a 'no smoking allowed' sign. Now, you might be wondering what his has to do with their service. The staff did not do anything about it and seemed to let it go. The manager even had a little pow wow with them. Seriously, people around me were staring at these guys and the staff didn't care.  After waiting for our food and having to sit next to the annoying guys, our food comes. I noticed that my plate didn't even have meatballs. I nicely told the waitress and she replied that she didn't know what to do. She told the same manager that chit chatting with the guys and simply replies 'oh well get her some'. By the time they get to me, I was already more than half way done and told my waitress that I didn't want them anymore and asked for the check. The food was not warm and they didn't give my boyfriend a steak knife with his steak. The poor family next to us who were seated before us didn't even get served after we received our food. They even complained to the manager as well.

Annie D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",353,740,191,3.0,6/8/2011,"We're almost always here on Tuesdays after my bf's softball team is down with their games, so we're here pretty late, 9 or 10PM.   There will be a group or 10 or so every time we come and I'm not quite sure why it takes them so long to set up tables when during this time... it's pretty slow.  So 15 mins later, almost every time.. our servers have been pretty good with taking our orders. So besides the normal pizza that I would normally get at any other BJ'S, I thought of trying out some other new healthier items since it's so late in the night to be eating.  I've tried Creole Tilapia-Oven roasted tilapia topped with a tomato olive tapenade and served with rice pilaf, baby greens tossed in our balsamic vinaigrette and topped with shredded carrots, red onions, cucumbers and tomatoes- this dish is quite tasty, I would order this again.  Mediterranean Vegetable Pasta- Rotini noodles tossed with roasted vegetables, sun-dried tomatoes, capers and Kalamata olives mixed with a light vegetable broth and topped with pine nuts, fresh basil, Parmesan cheese and parsley.- this was almost like a pasta salad. Wasn't so bad. Good alternative to regular pasta.  Mini Tacos-Two mini corn tortillas filled with spicy, tender barbacoa beef or fajita marinated chicken breast, topped with cabbage, baja sauce and pico de gallo.  Served with a tangy slaw of shredded cabbage and pickled carrots- this was average, nothing special.  Seared Ahi- Sliced sashimi grade ahi served with Asian slaw, wasabi and soy ginger sauce for dipping- this had a odd taste to it and wasn't good, don't get this dish! Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad-Our new light and fresh Caprese-style salad! Fresh mozzarella and tomato wedges with basil, red onion and Parmesan cheese drizzled with balsamic glaze- very simple and fresh salad.  Gourmet Mac & Cheese- A delicious and creamy blend of rotelle pasta with three cheeses, chipotle and a hint of garlic. Topped with seasoned breadcrumbs and bacon then oven-baked for a golden brown finish- they got this mac right! Piranha® Pale Ale Nachos- Crisp corn tortilla chips over chili made with BJ's Piranha® Pale Ale and topped with jack and cheddar cheeses, diced tomatoes, green onions, sliced olives and sour cream- this dish sounded good, but when it came out, the cheese was hard and stuck to the chip, so any chip without cheese wasn't going to get any. The chili was in the middle on the bottom of the dish, like maybe a spoon full? Yeah, I returned the dish.  Chicken Wings-More than a pound of crisp, tender chicken wings, drizzled with hot and spicy buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. Served with celery sticks, extra sauce and dressing for dipping- wings are always good. Beer- Great.  Overall, it's a good place to hang out, have some beers and most of the items on the menu isn't out to disappoint, but I would choose this place to come wine and dine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=440

The beer is good and the food is pretty good as well.  The pizzookie dessert (warm cookies with ice cream on top) is awesome.

Good tomato soup too.  The pizza has the best crust in my opinion of any place in the bay area. It's expensive, but worth it. I like they throw in tomatoes and garlic for free as toppings. It's a deep dish unless you order thin, so even a small pizza is the kind of meal you have to take home to finish by yourself, especially if you order an appetizer first.  I like the spaghetti & meatballs and the jambalaya too. The service is hit or miss. Sometimes they get pretty busy, so it's easy to understand.  If you're a hamburger or steak kinda guy, there are better options though.

Wilson K.,"San Mateo, CA",27,231,7,4.0,1/31/2009,"Personally, I would give 4 and a half stars but since there's no half stars and since they're not perfect, only 4. I come here occasionally when I'm tired of my weeks of Kashi meals, Eating Right, or Healthy choice meals.  Sometimes I just need a greasy pizza, calzone, or hot wings AND some drinks.  I only have their beer here because if I want a drink I'm more than likely not going to have a ""That hit's the spot"" drink at a chain restaurant.  Maybe it's just me. I really like their hot wings.  It's not as greasy as I sometimes need it, and sometimes I really need greasy hot wings.  But they are good enough to have time and time again.  Their beer is good, I've had the sampler but mostly, I stick with the berry burst cider.  Very light, sweet, and flavorful.  Don't expect to get a buzz off it though. I've had their calzones, which are good but teeny.  I also had their pizza.  VERY TASTY.  However, for a deep dish it's supposed to be a regular crust LOADED with toppings.  Their pizza is a thick crust with a thin layer of toppings.  The crust IS tasty, very buttery and moist like a fresh croissant.  YUMMY.  So I guess it evens out. I've had average customer service, with one bad waiter when I was sat in the very back corner next to the kitchen.  When I got my pizza we had to ask for the pizza condiments, and all I really wanted was some crushed pepper flakes.  The first time we asked from a bus boy we were brought a 75% empty parmesan cheese shaker...  and finally the waiter brought us the crushed pepper flakes after asking him directly. When we were 97% done with our meal the waiter asked if we wanted more cider... if he had asked before we were half way through (because a pitcher only fills four glasses and there were three of us) then we may have ordered another one.  But a last minute addition to bump up your tip amount isn't working on me. Overall, it's good when you need a break from healthy food.  Food is good, but don't expect extraordinary service or bells and whistles.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=680

They appear to like frying things at BJ's, menu items you wouldn't expect to be that fried or greasy.  I got a a Sesame Chicken Salad for myself.  I my usual questions (does the dressing have MSG? does the chicken have nitrates?) and was pleased with the answers, no on both counts.    My salad had these fried wontons that I picked around (very greasy, not what I look for in a salad).  The dressing was blah and the chicken was dry and tasted like it came out of an institutional kitchen.  I picked up a California Grilled Chicken Sandwich for the husband, which came with some of the most fried fries we've ever tasted.  I chose the thick cut fries, but I would call them the cardiac special with an extra thick fried layer before you get to the potato inside.  Hubby said the sandwich smacked of mass-production and didn't leave him wanting more.

Bianca K.,"Belmont, CA",195,13,,4.0,2/11/2011,"I've always been a fan of BJ's since the first time I tried it years ago in Cupertino. The pizzas are great - I can never say no to chubby dough! Plus, the pizookies are a real treat and is something to look forward to after a delicious meal.  My husband and I went to this particular BJ's on a Thursday night for a long overdue date night. The restaurant was moderately packed, but not insanely busy, so we were able to get seated within 10 minutes. Our waitress was prompt and took our orders immediately. I had the strawberry lemonade, hubby got Sierra Mist and we agreed on calamari to start with. The strawberry lemonade was too sweet for my taste, so I had to ask for extra ice to water it down. The calamari was delicious - loved the breading, and the sizes of the squid were particularly large. I guess I was expecting some tinier cuts of squid, but hey, I don't complain unless the tentacles are missing (those are my fave!) For our main course I ordered a small sweet pig (the combination of chubby dough, cheese, pineapples, tomatoes and ham are too scrumptious to miss) while my hubby ordered his usual BJ's meal, the crispy chicken sandwich. My sweet pig was delectable - the dough was as chubby as expected, though I could have used a little more pineapple on it. Hubby's sandwich was delicious too (I had a bite). I loved how the sandwich didn't have a generic large chicken patty, but instead, it showcased what seemed to me were moderately-sized pieces of crunchy chicken tenders. That made such a difference! With a side of their honey mustard sauce, you can even toss out the bread and just go to town w/ the tenders. Yum! Of course it wouldn't have been a complete BJ's experience if we didn't order a pizookie. We were much too full to eat it at the restaurant so we ordered the chocolate chunk to go and enjoyed it at home while watching Sammi and Ronnie hash it out on Jersey Shore. Amazing is all I can say (both for the pizookie and Sammi & Ronnie's drama). It's nice to know that after all this time, BJ's has remained consistent with their food, and has kept the pizookie perfect! Our waitress was swift and attentive - but not as attentive as I'd hoped. While she did swiftly refill our drinks without being asked, I wish she would have just stopped at our table to ask if we actually wanted refills because I hate wasting drinks. Plus, I wanted water instead of a second glass of strawberry lemonade, but because she was trying to be some sort of ninja server, she had no idea that she was serving me something I didn't want and ask for. A little note: ask before you bring something. It's good to be proactive, no doubt, but there is a reason why asking your customers is important. All in all, our experience was fun and memorable. We had an awesome date night at BJ's and would certainly keep coming back in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=680

Abi U.,"Fremont, CA",228,304,3,4.0,8/8/2008,"For how crowded this place gets they do a pretty good job of taking care of people (I'm speaking for my experience!).  Whenever I go to BJ's I never make reservations. I probably should but what I feel like eating at 4pm might not be the same thing I feel like eating at 7 so for that reason (and laziness) I'll always wait. The last time I went was around 8 on a Saturday night and we had a party of 4. The wait was only about 15 minutes and from the look of it it seemed like it was a packed house. Getting seated so early was a surprise although I've never waited longer than 30 minutes here.  The scene is reminiscent of a vintage sports bar. There are TVs everywhere, a good beer selection (I wish I drank beer so I could actually appreciate this!), and there's that lemony pledge kinda feel at all the booths (a good thing!). The crowd here is pretty diverse so no worries on not fitting in. Although the place seems packed the dining area is spaced out enough to be able to enjoy your company and not catch too much of your neighbor's conversation.  Service is good. The waiter I had was very friendly and attentive. Since they were really busy he made a point to apologize for any extended waits we may experience and to just flag him down if he's slacking. Sounds a bit casual but we (my party) were comfortable and I felt for him and his 8 hour waiting shift...:T. Despite his advanced apology he really didn't need to apologize at all. Service was on point, we never had to ask for refills and he even came around to remind us about dessert which i NEVER refuse here! PIZOOOKIESSS MMMMMMMMMMM!  The plates are huge here so even though the menu leans more towards the expensive side you get what you pay for. The clam chowder was enough to fill me up but I still pick off of everyone else's plates! They have salads, steaks, fish.... your basic American dinner I guess is the best way to describe it? Trust me the food is pretty filling.  Pizookies..... you HAVE to get one while you're here. there's no excuse and when you go home and try to make one it won't work. I've tried :(.  I like this location a lot better than the Cupertino location because of the parking. Easy access to the car, easy to leave to get the bridge, then easy time to crawl out of the car and into bed from food coma.

The tequila came with the rim of the shot glass salted. I asked the waiter the ingredients of their wedge salad. He said it was made on a wedge of cabbage (it's really iceberg lettuce) and listed one of the toppings as cilantro (it's really parsley!) When our salads came, we had to ask the waiter for napkins and silverware as he was walking away. And finally, the service was just slow. You have to wait forever for anything there.

Their staff at the front counters are almost all smiles and are quick to greet you with a warm hello. Its their waiters however that really seem to need better training....... On one ocation, me and my friend actually sat around the table for a good 15-20mins before anyone even arrived to take our order! As it turns out our waiter was new and was a little overwhelmed with his responsibilities. Then on the flip side I once had a wonderful waitress who was not only attentive, but even offered to provide us Happy Hour prices even though we were not seated at the bar.  So yesterday evening I was at home cleaning out the inside of my car when a friend of mine pulls up to my house and drags me out to have dinner. We wind up going to BJs for a quick bite and boy...it was packed inside for a Tues evening at 6pm. Fortunately however we only had a 10min wait time and were prompt seated. The waiter was rather quick to take our order. However we couldn't seem to locate him at all later on into the meal! No water refill, no asking for more things.....this guy was nowhere to be seen!  After we were done with our meal, we sat around and twittled our thumbs waiting to pay the bill. Looking around, it seemed other patrons who were being served by the same waiter were just as perplexed. Finally after another 15mins of sitting around doing nothing, he finally comes back around only to get flagged down by a million tables all waiting for him to service them. Fortunately out of the chaos, we also managed to get his attention and grab the check. Not wanting to wait some more, my friend quickly stuffed his credit card w/ the receipt and handed it back to the waiter.  I don't know if their overworked, underpaid, or just plain understaffed.

Drown anything in ice cream, and I'm usually a happy camper. I will admit, the beers seem to be quite good, or so the few ""tasting"" sips I took led me to believe.

But my girl and I just got off of work in the city and decided to head to BJs for a late night dinner and some drinks.  So we head in and were sat immediately, after being sat we had to wait a about 10 mins to be greated and asked for drinks. At that moment, we knew what we wanted and ordered as soon as he asked us if we wanted anything to drink. we ordered a couple drinks, an appetizer and a pizza. The drinks came in about 5 mins and were strong and tasty, as we were sipping, another 5, 10, 15 mins went by and no appetizer. All of a sudden are pizza arrived, we were starving and started to dig in, our server was no were to be found, he finally came around and asked us how our meal was and i asked him it was great, but didn't we order an appetizer? he told me no, and said he can put in an order if we wanted and proceeded to walk away.  At that point, i was full and tired, we just wanted to go home.

The only drawback is that I think they should add just a few more pieces of chicken. I also order the dressing on the side, otherwise it's a bit too rich for me. Whatever you do, skip the BBQ chicken pizza. The menu had a photo of it and it looked delicious. I split it with RA one time and it was way too sweet. I would definitely not order that again.

One of my friends ordered Strawberry Splash, a blended strawberry concotion that was supposed to have Grey Goose in it, but my taste buds could hardly detect it.

Tahoe Q.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",0,74,,4.0,7/19/2011,"I just wanted to share an incident that just happened to me this past Sunday night. While I have been very pleased with the Reno BJ's, and go there frequently for lunch, this is the 2nd time I've been to the BJ's in San Mateo.  Well locals already know: the place is MOBBED on most evenings. Same was true for this past Sunday night. My husband and I ordered the blackened salmon salad to-go. We were told it'd be just 10-15 min till it was ready for pick-up. So we strolled the Bridgepointe shopping mall and returned about 20 minutes later. Order was somehow lost? How? Dunno! But the ticket was still there in the que. The to-go gal apologized profusely, went back to the kitchen to whup some a$$, and in about 30 minutes (total time), our salad was delivered to our hands by the manager. She not only apologized, but comp'd us - FREE salad - just for our waiting for 30 min.  There are many (so many!) restaurants that would simply not give a rat's patootie if a customer waited 30 min, 60 min. It would be our fault. If we got up and walked out, they'd probably be relieved! But the BJ's in San Mateo actually epitomized some very old-fashioned customer service values.  My other observation is that despite a menu that's about 10 pages long (always a worrisome sign to me - do they nuke the food right from the CostCo pallet?) BJ's in San Mateo and Reno seem to serve consistently delicious food! It's great value for the money.

I went here today to eat lunch and here is what we ordered: 1) Handbreaded Chicken Parmigiana 2) Chicken Tenders 3) Mac n Cheese 4) Oreo Pizookie The chicken parmigiana was pretty good for the first few bites. The cheese and spaghetti sauce gave a nice flavor to the chicken breast. The spaghetti is only ok and tastes like something you can make at home. The chicken tenders were dry and not special in any way. The mac 'n cheese tasted really cheesy and also not spectacular. The only thing that saved lunchtime for me was the oreo pizookie. I've had the other ones before and think this is BJ's standout dessert dish. If I come here, I always want to order this. My boyfriend suggested I try the Oreo one. I've never ordered it in the past, thinking it'll taste artificial in flavor like the original cookie version. But I was thankfully proved wrong. My first bite into the pizookie was like heaven almost. The straight-out-of-the-oven, melt-in-your-mouth first bite was delicious. I was so full by then but took every ice-cream topped bite with glee. I highly recommend the Oreo pizookie next time. The food isn't memorable so if you come here, don't expect much.

Victor R.,"San Francisco, CA",184,8,,1.0,8/22/2008,"Since I work near this BJs I have been to it several times before. Their service is usually pretty slow, the food is over priced, and the food is only ""okay."" When I say ""okay"" I  mean bland, and sometimes cold. It's like they thrive off of bland food, but they think you will put up with it since it has a pseudo sports bar atmosphere, with the familiarity of a big corporate restaurant chain. I don't understand why there's always a line for such an over-rated place, but it doesn't matter since I will never go there again. Last night was the last time I will go to BJs. After winning my basketball championship at the PJCC, my team went to celebrate at BJs at about 9:10pm ( a Thursday night)  When we get there, I tell them that we need a table for 11 champions. The hostess tells me that there is no wait. She goes to setup the area. 1 minute later, we had an extra person show up, so I immediately tell them to grab 1 more chair. All of a sudden, the wait went from 0 minutes to 20...hmmm...okay, whatever. Well, 35-40 minutes later, we are finally seated. During the long wait, a 13th person shows up. I guess adding people is a big deal to them, because when we went to our table, adding 1 more chair was too much to handle. We were a lil annoyed by this, but I guess its understandable since we went from 11 to 13 people. However, there was no silverware or napkins at our table. We waited another 20 mins just to have someone ask us about drinks. After getting the drinks, nobody came to get our order. We got fed up, and decided to leave. This is not before they tried to make us pay for an extra pitcher of beer, when there was only 1 beer pitcher on the table. So, we wasted a whole hour and 15 minutes to drink water...fantastic. If you like to over pay for bland food after waiting at least 20 minutes to get it, then BJs has you covered!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=700

Brown D.,"Vallejo, CA",0,21,,2.0,3/31/2012,"I would rate this a one, yet I've been suprised on SOME visits to this establishment that I feel as if it was unfair if I didn't acknowledge those positive points. Things that were positive were the amount of choices given for delectable dishes, desserts, pizzas and appetizers as well as beers on tap. Negative points included occasional server/hostess attitude and rudeness. You would usually find staff members giving a sense of superiority since they work at a very busy establishment, yet I feel that if you wish to continue having statisfied cliente then a change should be made in the attitudes expressed to customers during their dining experience. Of course like I said I've had several servers surpised me from my past experiences so I have decided to reflect it in the score. I also would like to mention food quality since service to get your initial dish usually gives you enough time to probably plan out your week. Quality has been hit or miss as well yet I have found a few instances where I felt as if I had to visit the facility several times during my visit and normally when I go out to eat I don't tend to feel as if my food is racing to get in and out of my system at an expressed rate. Positive things I could include about this establishment are their selection of signature beers as well as their signature dessert the pazookie which I wish at times was a lot cheaper since the dessert itself seems so much easier to make than how its priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=700

I give him credit that when the orders were in the drinks and food came quickly, but he barely spoke to us and not once did he come back and ask how our meal was going. There were no less than 10 servers floating around the place and I couldn't understand why the service was so bad. You'd think people who make their living off of tips would be friendlier.  Roomie got a Chili & Cheese Potato, which was okay according to her. There was not enough chili, making it more or less a huge baked potato with cheese piled on it. I took a bite and though the potato was perfectly cooked, it wasn't as advertised and certainly not worth $8.95. The halibut fish tacos on the other hand were great. I have mentioned before that I'm sensitive to spicy foods, but the chipotle mayo was very mild, leading me to quip ""This must what it's like for people who like spicy foods."" The vegetables inside (red cabbage, carrots, onions and cilantro) were very fresh and crispy, but the fish itself was a highlight. Deep fried in panko the halibut was light and flaky and not overly fishy.  For dessert we split a Pizookie, but I was underwhelmed. Sure warm cookie dough with ice cream on top is delicious, but I very well could have done the same at home. Plus some of our cookie decided that the Tin Pan was it's BFF, and stuck there for good.  Overall, the food was good enough to come back, for me at least, but the service assures that I never will. Pity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=800

Most of the food on the menu is mediocre and not too memorable, with the exception of a few things... and I wished they'd slim down the menu (though people rave about how there's ""something for everyone here,"") because half the things like some pasta dishes and those 'pot stickers' that you can probably buy at Costco are, well, not really worth the money you throw down.   What IS worth my +/- $5 is the half-off, happy hour priced mini (10"") pizzas!!!

The waiter definitely was not the friendliest guy I've seen...and as for the food, that took another 20-30 minutes (though it felt much longer). I honestly think the reason why this place seems so busy is because their food is SO freaking slow, so the table turnover isn't that fast or something. Ooops there goes the second star! The food was actually quite bland, not flavorful at all. Then came time for BJ's to redeem itself...with the pazookie. Another 20 long minutes after ordering it (although I guess it takes time to bake the cookie or whatever), we dig in to the pazookie only to find it unbearably and unnaturally SWEET.

We are hooked on the great food and service at BJs.  We went last week and our waiter was Alex.  He was attentive, asked all the right questions and made great recommendations.  We have ordered pizzas, steaks, wedge salads and avocado egg rolls.  Everything is always really tasty, exactly as we ordered and fast!.  The place has a pub/ sports bar feel where you eat quick and run or lounge and enjoy the game.  Check it out, you will not be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=780

(I know, I know, it's an untraditional choice for holiday dinner, but we're humoring the kids.) We've been here twice, and both times have had the traditional deep-dish Chicago style pizza. (Note the chain originated in southern California, so if you prefer to have Chicagoans make the deep dish, you'd best look elsewhere.) The kids love the pizza, but they love any pizza, even Round Table. I find the pizza good but not great, the service friendly, and the atmosphere lively. One thing I like about the pizza is it's not too greasy. Sometimes the deep dish pizzas can be a little too greasy on the crust side as the restaurants go for maximum flavor (mmmm...fried bread).  BJ's pie strikes a decent balance. We loved the pizookis, as did many other Yelp'ers.  We got the cookies and cream variant, which is essentially a warm Oreo cookie-cake-crust thing covered with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and some kind of whipped mouse topping.

I guess that's why i had to down 3 tall glasses of water to dilute the sodium! Everyone else's dish at my table looked pretty big, so at least you'll know this place doesn't skimp. The wedge fries were good. But isn't almost everything fried yummy? We got a table immediately for 5 people and service was adequate... a little clumsy but attentive enough.

Each time, the servers were helpful in making menu recommendations and paying attention to details like refills or splitting checks. Excellent service! The food on both occasions was not particularly different from other chain restaurants that serve American styled dishes. In some instances on the menu, the prices were slightly higher than anticipated for the same dish at an equal quality dining spot.   I had a Parmesan Crusted Chicken that was a bit on the dry side with relatively little taste and served with decent mashed potatoes but overcooked broccoli. Another time, it was a nicely done buffalo chicken deep dish pizza with celery, red onions, and grilled chicken with tangy buffalo sauce and ranch--it was definitely worth coming in for. Our group also ordered Pizookis (table of 15) and they were nice enough to make multiple pizza (large) sized cookie/vanilla ice cream desserts for us to share.

What's been good: things like fried calamari, fries, fish and chips, burgers, etc.; and the beer selection, which should have something for everyone. (I wish they had a better cider selection.) In the past I've had their thin crust pizzas, which I really like. Also, having calorie counts next to everything helps with smart choices, and they have a special menu with an assortment of low-calorie, satisfying offerings that are worth trying.  Also, surprisingly, it's fairly kid-friendly. When my wife and I go with our two year old we generally have a good experience.

We wait 10 minutes to be acknowledged by somebody and order a round of waters and a diet coke before we get to the good stuff.

Though it does lead into the next issue; 2) There seems to be a rush to get myself and whomever I am with to eat and leave. I can understand that the place is trying to make money but there seems to be an urgency to order and then give us the check as we're still swallowing the last bit of food. 3) What's up with the waitress or waiter disappearing after the food is served? The one thing that seems to irk me and whomever I am dining with is that the waiter/waitress that disappears after the food is served and ignores the fact that there are drinks that need to be refilled.

Had lunch here yesterday, and the experience was underwhelming, to say the least. Both the food and the service sucked: 1. The waiters did not come by to take our order for a long time. Too long, in fact. We had to waive them down to make sure that we could eat before the polar ice cap finishes melting. 2. I ordered a blackened chicken sandwich, and it was the greasiest, most disgusting thing I've eaten in a while. It was heated on a griddle, and the outside of the sandwich was slathered in oil and/or butter. It had an unnatural oily sheen to it. The wedge fries were almost orange instead of a nice lite yellow because they had sat in the deep fryer way too long. They were beyond cooked; they were completely saturated in oil and glistened in the light. Completely inedible. 3. When the food was delivered, they didn't bring us silverware. We had to ask for it. Maybe they expected us to just slam our faces into our plates. Sooeey! 4. Sandwiches with fries. Gee, do you think a good waiter would bring ketchup and mustard to the table with our order?

T H.,"San Mateo, CA",2,33,,2.0,10/21/2005,"Ok, so I wanted BJ's to work out. New face on the restaurant scene (for our area), interesting ambiance. Possibly interesting menu. Reasonably well established chain.  I've been responsible for 2 groups eating at their 2 new locations (Bridgepoint & Tanforan). A group of 7 and a group of 5.  The first visit, to Bridgepoint, was about a week after they opened. We waited a week intentionally to let them get the bugs worked out.  Ambiance is ok, interesting, and not usual. Considering that I'm bored to tears with San Mateo County's restaurant collection, I had some hope that this chain would be worth frequenting.  However, after the meal, not one person at the table had a ""wow, this is good"" response to any of the food on the table. (Yeah, we shared, trying a bite of several plates.)  And in fact, the most common response from our group, business people that eat out frequently, was ""nothing special"", ""too bland"", and my personal response, ""exploring new levels of mediocrity"".  French Dip has sauteed onions and melted cheese... ok, I'll try it. Bland. Au jus was cold by the way. (On the menu, it's called a Roast Beef Dip Sandwich I think.)  Onion strings. eh. Normal. But the 2 sauces served were tasteless and wasted.

Luckily I didn't have to pay for any of the alcohol... We had 2 rounds of beer (apparently their brewed beer is famous all over) and my friend and I had tequila shots (THEY'RE HUGE..), plus I had a screwdriver (it was so strong.. I wanted to gag b/c of such a high alcohol content..), and we had vodka cranberries, and margaritas.  Yummy... My friend I came with got really drunk really fast and apparently she has a high alcohol tolerance too.. I guess she didn't have anything to eat though..  And she held my hand really hard under the table.. hahaha.. I was like, woah...  We went outside for a smoke and we were all guessing ages (if we didn't know how old we all were) and I told my friend and her friend that they looked early 20s, and then the old lesbo who tagged along got really excited and was like, how old do i look!?!? And note that I was starting to get a little drunk, so I was starting to tell more of the truth... so I was like, umm... 48? and she was like, really? that old? and I was like, ohh shit... I'm going to get my ass kicked now... and I went, Yeah.. you do. and my friends were like, oh shit.. we better run away... and the old looking woman was like, I'm 34! and I went, oh.. you don't look that young LOL...  Dangggg..

Their IPA in particular (which is not, sadly, always on tap) is really pretty damn good for a chain.

Kurt W.,"Foster City, CA",2,30,9,2.0,8/16/2009,"This rating is based on several visits for lunch and dinner.  While an extensive menu, I've never found anything I cared much for except the occasional HUGE baked potatoes and of course the Pazookies.   Other than those, the food is nothing special and neither are the beers, especially for a ""brewhouse"".  Service has always been a mixed bag though mostly sub par.  There is the occasional server who really is efficient with a pleasant personality to match, however more often than not, they are rushed.   So after so many visits, what finally compelled me to write a review?  Unfortunately it's not because of a positive experience.  This afternoon one of the people in our group suggested to go here for lunch.  I wasn't particularly hungry so didn't mind.  It wasn't too busy for a Sunday, so we got seated within a few minutes.   There were a couple of empty tables around us, but otherwise brisk business.   We quickly decided what to drink, we'd be ready as soon as the server came by......which after 20 minutes, never occurred.  Not one server stopped by our table.  We clearly had our menus closed in front of us and no water or drinks at the table.  If I'd really wanted to eat there, I would have asked someone to help us, but why the heck would I go and ASK to be served in a restaurant????  Finally we gave up and just left the table, but not before I found the manager and told him why were were leaving.   He of course offered the obligatory apology and said he would get someone, but I told him there was no point (after all, they'd probably just do unmentionables to our order).  I was calm but very direct.  On our way out, the host cheerfully thanked us which prompted another explanation of our hasty departure.  He too apologized and offered to serve us himself, but again, I'm not stupid. So this pretty much has done it for me.  I work close by so often times we have group or business lunches here, but not for me.  It's unfortunate as I know many of the people that work there truly do their best but I'm not going to support such inconsistency, chain or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=860

We've tried to go to BJ's a few times, but always end up at Red Robin next door because this place is so packed. Since we were in the area last night, we stopped by to see and, alas, there were tables available! (Of course...it was Monday...but whatever.)  We walked in the door and were seated right away. I ordered a diet coke...but they only carry Pepsi products...which doesn't normally bother me. We ordered the Santa Fe egg rolls ( I think that's what they were called) and a pizza with artichokes and tomatoes and spinach. We waited for quite some time (which I anticipated for the pizza...but not for the egg rolls). At this time I tried my soda. For some reason, the diet Pepsi tasted a bit odd. I decided that I would order some water instead. The egg rolls finally arrived...and then our pizza arrived maybe 2 minutes later. I hate that! Why would the egg rolls take as long as a pizza? And why wasn't the pizza put in a little later so we could eat our appetizer before our meal arrived? Regardless, both of these were brought out by someone other than our server. We waited and waited and waited and finally our server stopped by. I requested some water, which I had rather quickly. The pizza and egg rolls were FANTASTIC. Its quite possibly one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The sauce per pizza ratio was perfect...the crust is amazing...overall it scores a 10!  We finished our meal and then waited and waited and waited for our server again. She was never even in the area! She finally stopped by and I asked for a box for the leftover pizza. The box she brought was too small....so we waited and waited and waited for her to stop by again so I could get another box. Anyone noticing a pattern here? Our server was DREADFUL! She dropped off the check and was gone in a flash! She finally brought me a normal sized box and we were gone.  Moral of the story...fantastic food....terrible service.

Don and Regina S.,"Antioch, CA",3,73,85,4.0,7/7/2009,"We were in town to meet with some people for our up coming wedding. The vendor was running late so we went to BJ's to get a small bite to eat. We normally go to the BJ's in San Bruno at Tanforan. So I was surprised when we walked in and this BJ's had no wait time. We were sat near their TVs (had golf and baseball on). To be honest the food is average! However the server we had was EXCELLENT! His name was Alexander. He had no problem going back to the bar and getting me a new drink because I thought it tasted flat or even going back to the kitchen to get us ranch even though he just came from there. He was all smiles, very friendly and courteous throughout our stay. The next time we are in town we will be back because of Alexander and we will only sit at his table.

W L.,"San Leandro, CA",4,45,5,3.0,8/8/2011,"Have come here four times for dinner after work, and all good experiences with food.  It's a very extensive menu (think Cheesecake Factory on a smaller scale). Now that chain restaurants are required to print calorie counts with menu items, however, it almost gives me a heart attack to read it.  You'd think a chicken club would be pretty innocent, not half your day's caloric allowance.  So, if you come here on a diet, you'll find something, but not a lot of choices.  You weren't coming here on a diet, were you? Always amazed at how quickly they can seat you when it looks like they're operating at over capacity.  It's always crazy busy here, but the service is good, efficient and friendly. Just this last time we waited 25 minutes for our appetizer, the ahi poke, long after another table had been seated after us, and was deep into their nachos.  The waitress finally brought us seared ahi instead, and that was only after we clarified that my husband was NOT asking for the ahi to be added into his dinner salad.  A more experienced served might have tried to clarify rather than try to run with this bizarre concept. Her manager came over later to apologize and gave us the ahi poke on the house. I like not getting attitude, and I like when management tries to get it right, even if this is a chain restaurant.  There are advantages to corporate food service, sometimes.  Prices are reasonable, and I can hear my husband when I talk to him even though it's a sports fans' paradise and big party atmosphere all the time.  You should go here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=860
Destry H.,"Alameda, CA",188,207,998,3.0,8/25/2008,"My wife and I went exploring, and we found out that there was a BJ's in San Mateo. Being very excited that we had now had one in the Northern Cal/West Bay area we decided to venture over there one early evening and have dinner. Being that we have dined at the BJ's in Brea,Ca on multiple occasions, and have had extremely pleasant dining experiences, we expected the same here in Northern Cali! It was around 5-6PM .We were seated within 10-15 minutes, our waiter/server was attentive although it was Monday evening and I guess we hit it the right time because it started to get busy. The restaurant has a very open layout, but seating is very tight? Because it doesn't  look like  the""Restaurant and Brew house"" style.....it doesn't  have the same feel as the Brea location. However, the service was fast & attentive, the food was adequate in portions and in taste!

Huuuugeee serving and the quality is definitely up there.  The interior is nice and my servers have always been attentive. The beer ranges in quality though.

The first menu was splattered with someone's nachos or something, even our server was grossed out. She brought me a new one. Service was OK for a Sunday night.

We did have a problem with a table of 12 that was sitting in the center of the restaurant. This group was so loud and  obnoxious that everyone around them was uncomfortable. You could see it in everyone's face as they just looked around thinking someone would come over and speak to them. Yes, I probably should have brought it to the managers attention.

James P.,"San Diego, CA",8,33,3,3.0,12/26/2011,"BJ's is a brewpub atmosphere with a pretty broad menu and a full bar, if you want it.  This BJ's is always hopping, good luck getting a seat at the bar. I ate there 4 or 5 times in the course of three weeks (visiting on business).  It's hard to write a review when the short story is that the food is really, really good (by brewpub standards) but the service is bad, bad worse.  Every time I went I prayed that it wouldn't be worse than last time and it always was.   Let me start with the food.  For lunch I had the tomato bisque and half sandwich, which is a really good choice if you are not a big eater.  For dinner, I had the calzone, which was wonderfully delicious, served hot and really filled me up.  I also sampled many of their pizzas on other visits and they are high quality and dependable. I don't know where to begin with the service.  Let me work backwards.  In all cases, once it was time to get the check, it was like pulling teeth to get it.  In two cases we actually had to get up and find someone to bring it.  The check was usually wrong.  Servers made numerous mistakes (including the checks) and never took responsibility for anything.  This included spilled drinks, delivering the wrong food, total inability to 'customize' anything (like no tomatoes, dressing on side, etc.)  If I hadn't had repeat performances from multiple servers I would have thought it was just one. In short, I generally recommend it but bring your patience and do not go if you are on a firm schedule.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-mateo?start=480
