Loren W.,"San Rafael, CA",0,15,3,1.0,12/17/2017,"This is the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in a long long time. It started when we were seated the hostess said we don't have any silverware ask your server. Server came 7-8 mins later asked for our drink order and left after the appetizer came ,brought by another guy. I realized no napkins so I ask the hostess that walked by for some she said we don't have any up here it's in the back ask your server. As my hand is now covered in sauce. But wait there's more.  Food comes food is wrong. Call the waiter tell him he runs away then the manager comes over ask  want us to try again YEAH IM starving why did the manager need to ask this .youd think that we would be a priority now well the water glass runs dry Pepsi has no more in it I have to goto the bar and refill my own drinks. So after 15 mins more and not so much as a I'm sorry it's coming out soon from the manager. I tell my girl we our out of here. I do customer service for a living and it's not if you make a mistake that counts it's how you rebound from a mistake that counts and keeps customers. Never will we eat at this place. Management it's the key to good employees and they didn't pick a good one",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=20
Alice X.,"Seattle, WA",558,604,2333,5.0,6/1/2016,Great place to watch the Warriors game!  The place is pretty big and there are plenty of flat screens to watch sports games.  I've only been seated in the bar area and the bartender/servers there were all very attentive and friendly! Their cream soda is on tap.

Anny N.,"San Rafael, CA",1,41,2,1.0,10/9/2017,"This place deserves no stars.. the workers here are rude or they hate their damn job.. or both. ive stopped eating here awhile back for the same reason but tonight for some reason i decided to order take out. I mean hey, that avoids the shitty service, ill just come get my food & go. STILL BAD. Not only that, they messed up my order pretty bad. I ordered the chipotle salmon with rice instead of couscous and fries instead of asparagus. I got the order and I didnt realize it was wrong in all types of way until I got home.. my fault I shouldve looked at the food while i was still there. The food came as is and my substitution werent honored however i did get a side of fries. The funny part is, the ticket on the to-go shows all the right modifications no asparagus sub fries & no couscous sub rice. So, i guess the chefs must hate it there too.. i truly hate this place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=20

Sophia L.,"San Rafael, CA",199,38,16,4.0,7/7/2017,Fun restaurant with your average all-American menu and bar. I was pleasantly surprised by the menu options when I went to eat yesterday for the first time in a year. It looks like they've expanded a lot of sections including the salads. I was really satisfied with my kale and Brussels sprouts salad with balsamic vinaigrette and lots of veggies. I shared a churro pazookie (a bunch of mini churros topped with vanilla ice cream) with the table for dessert which was a great treat. The one flaw in my dinner was the server's iPads which seemed to keep glitching and frustrating the servers. Ours was super sweet about the whole thing but it took about 7 minutes to place what should have been a quick order and I felt horrible for her.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=20
Thomas E.,"Novato, CA",15,35,12,2.0,10/29/2016,"BJ's is always a challenge. Our server today too 15 minutes to show up to our table after passing us twice. Bj's had a flyer at the front desk offering a free PIZOIKIE when paying by there app (picture attached). When my wife went to order, our server argued that this was only for new accounts. I had to actually get the flyer and ask our server to show it to his manager. Then he agreed that this was the current promotion.  I don't know if the server was uninformed or the manager was trying to get out of honoring the promotion. Maybe both. My wife tried to pay using the app. And it was very difficult, and finally we paid via credit card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=20
Lindsay B.,"San Rafael, CA",757,133,2365,3.0,4/6/2016,"Lunch here was decent, the food was OK- nothing special, I had the chicken lettuce cups and the fried artichokes with lemon Aoli. Probably too much considering it was my birthday and we got a pazookie.  The pazookies are BOMB! The service was fine, we sat at a booth in the bar area.

Mamali B.,"San Rafael, CA",112,31,1,1.0,3/24/2017,"Me, my fiancé and two guests from London were visiting you store in San Rafael. We sometimes go to your restaurant and the staffs are usually friendly and helpful, but things were totally different last night. First your manager, Travis, came to our table after 45 minutes and he said sorry the kitchen made a wrong deep dish and the right one it's on its way. I totally understand that these things happen in restaurants since I work in restaurants during my college time. After 15 minutes pizza came in and it was the wrong order. Also nobody even bothered to clean up our table. I was really frustrated at that time and asked for the manager. It took him another 15min to come to our table. After explaining the situation he offered me to not charged the pizza. Seems like he did not get my point because couple of pizza is certainly not effect me economically. He grabbed few dishes and left the rest on the table. We waited another 15min and no one brought us any clean dishes.

There were 3 employees in this area, none of which acknowledged my family and I standing there and instead turned the other way to help another customer who came in AFTER me.

Rose J.,"San Ramon, CA",0,7,,2.0,12/9/2017,"First off I want to say our Waiter was awesome!  After making an appointment 1 month before, upon getting to the restaurant we were told that they were not ready for us and that we would have to wait.  It took them 50 minutes to get ready and then seat us.  (Really? we had a reservation! You new we were coming)  Upon ordering appetizers and our meals. Our meals came out before the appetizers.  Food was missing from 4 of the people sitting with us.  It took the kitchen another 30-40 minutes to get them their meals.  The Manager never came over to apologize for the problem, however our waiter was on top of it all and very apologetic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=20

Rachel N.,"San Rafael, CA",45,275,24,1.0,12/28/2017,"Let me be clear: I've been to this location more than a handful of times, and while it's never been stellar, my last experience here was abysmal.  I don't need to go on in detail about it, but there were a lot of problems. We were seated first, but served last. The food was bland and cold. Our food came out before our drinks, and it took at least an hour for our food. They brought us the wrong drinks. We asked for things we never got and got things we didn't ask for, and when they brought us something ""on the house"", we noticed it on the bill. The server seemed so confused by how to use the in-house tech that I was shocked... just -taking- out order took five minutes. Our experience in total was two and a half hours. We didn't order appetizers or a dessert. That's simply unacceptable.  I know I'm going to go back. I like BJ's as a chain and they're convenient to where I live and work, but this kind of service is not going to fly with me again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael
Martin W.,"San Rafael, CA",11,113,62,3.0,7/25/2017,"This is more a general review of BJs. This location in particular has always been a nice place to be, with friendly host and attentive waiters. We had not having any problems in San Rafaels BJs Location. But our last visit shows that there is a trend in BJs, her it what we figured: Since the last several years the food variety at BJs has changed dramatically. In our opinion to the worst. We started visiting BJs couple years ago. The menu was almost Upscale Restaurant style, with good food choices like Grilled PorkChops, with Mustard and Apple Sauce. And this wasn't your regular Mustard or Apple sauce it was a high quality home made style condiment. This has all gone, and today BJs is there where it maybe belongs all the time: offering and serving Bar Food.  If we wouldn't had experienced those great offers in the last years, we surely would not complain, cause you get what you can expect here. But we are just so disappointed cause we saw what BJs has been capable off. I don't know if they have a new Food Director, but we will continue to going down on our visit frequency.  I have to say the new addition on the starter side (roasted cauliflower with almonds) have been great and are the outstanding piece this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael
Anita V.,"Novato, CA",4,85,136,3.0,6/26/2017,First when we were seated 4 other tables were also seated to the same server.  So Obviously she was very busy.  The severs have a little handheld computers so they don't make a lot of eye contact when they take the order.  She was friendly and did a good job considering the circumstances. We we're a party of 4.  The burger was perfect. One of the salads was so overdressed no one could eat it and The other salad was served not the way we ordered it so they comped it which was very nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael
Pedro L.,"San Rafael, CA",30,1,,2.0,1/13/2018,"Very pleasant ambience, but unfortunately the waiters are more concerned with the style of the haircut than really looking for the excellence of a professional service.

Poor Service from a bartender that appears to hate the world and lacks any/all social skills. This guy looks like and acts like the is no reason in the world to smile. Too bad, I really like this place and enjoy coming in on weekends to watch sports at the bar, but I'm sick of the service.

Lori V.,"Sonoma, CA",0,5,5,2.0,12/27/2017,"Awarding one star each for delicious sirracha brussels sprouts and stuffed mushrooms. HOWEVER, bar service was horrendous. Not only impersonal, but slower than hell. Went at 1 pm on a Wed and only 3 people other than myself and my guest at the bar. The bar receipt read ""Paige S"", and while she gave a friendly hello and took our order pretty quickly (as she should with only 3 guests at the bar), she was far more concerned with gossiping with her two friends than serving paying customers. Had to ask someone else for silverware 5 minutes after our apps arrived, never asked how everything was, didn't offer another beverage, and barely even said goodbye! Yelled it from across the bar and said ""thanks"". Won't be returning to this location based on such poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael

Ang L.,"Los Gatos, CA",200,296,392,1.0,9/4/2017,"We tried to come here for dinner the other night. But it didn't work out. The host at the desk told us it would be a 90 minute wait! I understand that he was busy with the phone, customers, and employees asking him questions. But the two girls next to him were standing around looking bored. I like the other BJ's that I've been to and was looking forward to having dinner here but telling customers that the wait is going to be 90 minutes is purposely telling customers to leave and not wait. If I were management, I would have a word with the staff about retention of customers and not turning business away. This makes me think twice next time when I want to go out to dinner and go to a type of establishment like BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael
Bill J.,"Petaluma, CA",0,58,1,1.0,12/17/2017,"Since this is brewpub I expected some decent beer. Oddly they didn't have any Pilsner other than Heineken. So we ordered it. The beer arrived completely flat with no head or carbonation whatsoever. Anybody serving beer should have immediately noticed it. We wanted to bring it to the attention of the waiter but he was nowhere to be found. It took quite a while to hunt him down. He finally brought a Stella to replace the Heineken. It was also flat. I ordered the Prime Rib medium rare. It arrived rare with an odd red color and appeared to have been brought up to a lukewarm temperature under a heat lamp. The horseradish was forgotten. Since a busboy brings the food, there is little chance to give the waiter feedback, or for him to check whether everything is satisfactory.  There is a lot of time between ordering and the drinks and the meal, and there is a definite lack of interaction that is sorely needed at this restaurant. To top it off, the pen left with the check did not work, and again the waitress who took over from the waiter was nowhere to be found.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael
Monica A.,"Union City, CA",6,2,3,1.0,11/21/2017,"What an awful experience. We came here for a nice company lunch and it was not what we expected. We thought we would be conserving time if we ordered online because we can also make our modifications online. But clearly that did not make our trip better. It doesn't matter if you order online, they don't start the food until you get there. While I understand this, all of our modifications weren't even taken into account. A couple coworkers got their orders wrong. There was a salad that was with no cheese that came with cheese. A chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato only that came with pickles and mustard only. Two burgers that were not cooked properly. The picture above shows a burger that should have been medium well but instead looked and was completely raw!!!! There was no point in ordering online when they literally messed up 60% of our orders. When we told the manager what was wrong, he was upset that we had ordered online! What's the point of having that option then!!! Needless to say, we will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael
Mikayla B.,"Lakewood, WA",159,14,1,1.0,1/2/2018,"Only reason I give them one star is because I can't give them 0 stars. As soon as we walked in we were ignored by multiple hostesses that seemed like they literally had no idea how to do their job. We waited 10 minutes before anybody even took our name down. It wasn't until what looked like the manager showed up that we got seated... after he asked multiple hostesses to seat us he finally got one to actually do it. We follow the awkward host to our table where we LITERALLY wait for 30 minutes before a waitress even acknowledges our existence. When we finally flagged down a waitress we found ourselves talking to someone that MUST have been under the influence. She was taking food to the wrong table and when she took our order she asked me multiple times what I wanted to drink as if she never asked me. We ordered our food too because we had so much time to decide, so we order a pizza and she goes ""ooooh... we're out of pizza. We're out of burgers too, a lot of stuff""...

Christina L.,"San Rafael, CA",21,133,502,3.0,10/1/2016,"August 15 2016 My mother and I were running around Marin doing errands and a little shopping when we decided to get something to eat at BJ's. We went in around 1045/11AM for an early lunch... I had a free appetizer coupon and we got calamari. How can you go wrong with calamari. The dipping sauce that came with the dish was pretty watery and overall weak... I don't know whether they decided to make their portions a bit smaller or if there isn't anymore calamari in the sea lol.  For entrees I had initially ordered the garlic shrimp and asparagus dish. When I had a mouthful of the pasta... I was underwhelmed.  I'm not trying to be harsh here, I COMPLETELY understand this is a chain and not a 3-star michelin star restaurant, but I mean it had little to no seasoning and very very little sauce...  I think I had like 5 asparagus's and 6-7 shrimps for a FULL plate of pasta. After trying to take a third bite I had enough. I decided to order the North Beach Mahi & Shrimp. That dish is beyond good!!! I had never felt like LICKING my plate except when my mother cooks...  Definitely will be ordering THAT again. As for my mom, she ordered the California chicken club and she was pleased. The fries were nice and thin... Definitely better than any fries I've had in a while (except inn&out fries lol) Overall I had an GREAT lunch at BJ's! Made a mistake on my end for choosing the wrong plate first, but luckily my waiter was kind enough to take it off our bill. We were be stopping in from time to time for calm chowder, calamari (if they up the portion) and their fish entrees for sure !!!!! Jan 5, 2017 The portions have significantly gotten smaller. Ordered the Atlantic Salmon and like you can see, the rice and mashed potatoes were smaller in size. I had to tell the waitress if she could garnish the salmon with herbs and sauce (came with none). Rice was undercooked and a piece of the salmon was overdone. My boyfriend loved his dish and convinced me to tip the waitress well over 20%, so I did. Sure wish I had a bit more food on my plate. Already miss the 2016 portions lol. Jan 12, 2017 Tonight's visit to BJ's' absolutely worth mentioning. Sayra was our waitress for the evening. Once our food came out from the kitchen and onto our table, I noticed that I didn't have the Steak Cut Fries I had ordered. Instead of taking my dish to redo the fries, she told me to ""keep it"" and she'll put in an order for the fries I wanted.  Most of the time they'll (waitresses and waiters) take the dish and remake it. The customer (I) will end up waiting while the mistake they made is corrected. Ultimately ruining the experience of ""dining together."" It's happened to me a number of times and although I acknowledge slip ups... it sucks.   Sayra brought out the fries I wanted and all was good. She deserved well over the suggested 20% tip. It's people like this that keep you coming back. No attitude, excellent customer service and all smiles!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael

The menu has EVERYTHING so I guess it has that going for it but a lot of it is food service or made outside of the restaurant.  The beers are okay and I'd recommend trying the Hefe, it was pretty good. On this visit we ordered a sampler platter but it was super boring and ALL made from frozen/food service. The main reason I gave this place 2 stars over 1 is the space itself and the tvs. If you have a large group then this would be a good spot to head to, otherwise, go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael

William W.,"San Rafael, CA",135,69,105,4.0,6/25/2016,I feel like this could be considered a staple in Terra Linda if you're looking for a casual restaurant with a full bar and specialty beer. It's menu is extensive ranging from deep dish pizza all the way to low calorie items as well. So if you're looking for a restaurant and not exactly sure what you're in the mood for this place is a great stop because there will be something that entices you.  Personal favorite; I'm a big fan of the brisket burger. If you do enjoy burgers I recommend this one first (not for the novice eaters). Plus all burgers come with your choice of sides and I usually lean towards the seasoned wedges.  Also if you are a beer drinker this place has its own brew house with so many good tasting beers. They also offer the sampler of four beers if you can't decide. And to top it off the main reason I go there is for the famous Pizookie!

We came in about an hour before closing, no one at the front to seat us. So we waited, and waited, and saw servers walk by avoiding us and said nothing. Finally a busser came over and said we can go to the bar.  The table was dirty but our nice server cleaned it. Went to the bathroom to find no toilet paper in nearly any of the stalls, the bathroom covered in paper towels and out of soap in 2 of 3 dispensers.  Thankfully, our server Jessica was amazing. She was prompt, polite and attentive. Food came fast and was good. Love the thin fries.  So 5 stars for Jessica  (name on the receipt) 1 star for the establishment.

The staff does more time yapping with each other than serving the customers.  Also, the timing is always off.  Despite repeated requests to bring the appetizer out first and then the entrees, they always seem to either (a) come out together, or (b) come out consecutively and quickly so that you are just starting to enjoy the appetizer and your entree arrives.  I don't I will be writing another review because we are not going there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=40

Salmon was super dry at one end and not cooked enough at the other.   They probably thought the single teaspoon of shaved parmesan was generous however I felt otherwise. No one at the take-out counter to take my order.  For several long minutes.  A precursor adn I wish I was paying more attention.  Had to flag down the busboy to find someone.

Excuse me? The mobile app makes you add a phone number, so why wasn't I contacted about my order? If that wasn't enough, it was gonna take an additional 15 minutes for the pizza to be made. It took a total of 10 minutes for me to even pay for my order. Once I FINALLY paid, I asked the ""waitress"" how long I would have to wait for the pizza and she laughed. Are you kidding me? The manager came over, never offered me anything, didn't apologize. Nothing. I work in this mall. It's ridiculous that this is the kind of service they provide. Needless to say I will not be coming back, ever. And I plan on telling all the family and friends that I have. Worst service I have ever received. This place is a JOKE.

Melissa B.,"San Rafael, CA",59,118,129,3.0,6/10/2015,"I find myself at BJ's more often than I'd like to admit, simply because they have a lot of TVs, which always play the big games that are on, and they have beer. The fact that they have a ton of different types of food to choose from adds to the fact that it's just a win-win situation when you need a TV, food, and beer. Other than that, BJ's really disappointed me last night. I went with a friend and we had just a 15 minute wait for a table, which was totally find because it was a busy game night. We got a beer at the bar and the bartender was great, and closed our tab before we went to our table. No complaints there. Our server though, awful. He walked up to us about 5-10 minutes after sitting down and goes, ""are you ready?"" I literally said, ""ready for what?"" Food.... Drinks... The game? Are you our server? Do you have a name? I've never NOT been introduced or at least told the name of my server before I've ordered my food. We took a few more minutes to decide and then another girl comes up to us and asks if we are ready to order. Did we change servers? We order about 2 times each because she was having a hard time hearing us-- and yes, it was super loud because of the game. About 10 minutes later they bring out my meal and then probably 5 minutes later my friends comes. But I got a sandwich and she got soup so I'm not sure why there was such a big gap in between but oh well. That really wouldn't have mattered if it was a good experience other than that. I wasn't offered ketchup or mustard and my friend had to track down one of our servers to get some. I'm also a little confused why my first beer was $4 at the bar and then my second beer was $5.75 at the table when I ordered them about 20 minutes apart. Did happy hour end in those 20 minutes or did I just pay $1.75 for him to walk my beer to the table? We finished eating and had to track them down again to ask for our bill. After we had paid I even had to ask for a box, which they never offered me even though I had half of my meal left in front of me the whole time.  Anyways, there are some times I go to BJs and have service that I think is normal, and I totally get that sometimes it's busy and you won't be waited on the whole time by your waitress/waiter, but that was just pretty lame and sub-par in my opinion. And the fact that we realized we had two servers because the woman was getting trained made me feel awful for her because she should NOT be getting trained by that guy. He could have probably introduced her as well, to start off. Most employees here are really nice and have good customer service but maybe someone needs to make their rounds and check things out because some people there have 0 personality and 0 customer service and if that's the case, I'd rather go somewhere else because it's pretty distracting from a good meal and good beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=80

And while our sample was in no way definitive, it did highlight why certain classic family-style joints might be in trouble, whereas a well-run if somewhat soulless corporate chain can do well.  The restaurant we went to the night before has been around since 1973, but in many ways seems to have not advanced past 1987 - no new items on the menu, no website or any acknowledgements that the Bush/Clinton/Bush/Obama era has ever taken place. On the other hand, you can tell that BJ's really keeps on top of everything - the menu reflects the range of tastes that its guests demand, one can bring in a coupon via smartphone, televisions are attuned to a healthy variety of sporting events. And, possibly most importantly, the staff is fresh and invigorating - I don't think we ever had to wait more than a couple of minutes. And our food - words can not describe how tasty my New Orleans Jambalaya was, but it went down easily and made my belly nice and content, accompanied by a nice, smooth Piranha Ale. And for dessert, the Salted Caramel Pizookie ensured that I wouldn't be needing any food for the next twenty hours.  Although we were there for nearly ninety minutes, the joint was efficient enough to make it feel like nine - yes, I know that not all chain restaurants are like this, I know that the food isn't necessarily the best for you, and probably somewhere there is a man being shortchanged on his bean profit. But damn it, BJ's makes for a very tasty and comfortable experience without being too expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=80

Mark D.,"San Rafael, CA",523,790,3790,4.0,11/16/2014,"This is a review of a solo dinner at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in San Rafael.  It is located outside of the Northgate Mall. The staff was friendly, professional and attentive.  This was true throughout my entire dining experience. The ambiance is warm and comfortable.  There are lots of TV's but, thankfully, the audio was turned down.  There is quite a bit of seating.  There is also a bar area.   The high ceilings give the space an open feel.  There are lots of wooden accents that help in providing a familiar and pleasant environment. The meal flowed at a nice pace. I was neither left waiting or overly rushed. I enjoyed all of my food. BJ's Fritos Nachos (Piranha Pale Ale Chili, crispy Fritos Corn Chips and Cheez Whiz Cheese Dip topped with shredded cheddar cheese, jalapenos, Applewood smoked bacon, sour cream, diced tomatoes and green onions.) - These were quite good.  The fresh ingredients were crisp and added a bit of lightness.  There were lots of Jalapenos but they were rather mild.  I would not have minded some slightly hotter peppers.  The cheese was fully melted.  I do think these would be even better if the chili was a tad more complex in flavour. It was a bit flat.  But overall, I really liked them.    Brewhouse Double Deluxe (Two 5 oz., fresh 100% USDA Angus beef patties, Applewood smoked bacon, grilled onions, crispy onion strings, cheddar and swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and BJ's signature burger sauce.) This was a pretty darn good burger.  The only real weakness was it had a pretty decent case of the soggy bottom bun blues.  But, it managed to hold together long enough for me to eat it.  The burger was cooked just right to the medium rare I requested.  The onion strings were a great crispy addition.  The bacon was tasty and perfectly cooked.  There was lots of nicely melted cheese.  The vegetables were fresh. This is a big burger with all of the fixin's. I also liked the fries.  They were crisp and there was just the right amount of salt.  Receipt (big dinner for one):  $20.61   Overall - Great service and a comfortable space combined with a tasty app and a very good burger to make for a very enjoyable dining experience.  For me, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in San Rafael was a winner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=100

Never had a bad pizza at any BJ's. This one just happens to be close to where I live now. I have been here a lot of times. I'm always fantasizing about the pizza when I arrive but then I start looking at the menu and something on page 23 catches my attention.... bad idea. I've ordered a lot of different stuff here and basically I regret not getting the pizza every time. I love their pepperoni pizza. It was a bit greasy the last time I had it but hey, you don't eat pizza because it's healthy. We eat it because it tastes good. That's why I gave them 2 stars. That and the Pizookie. Of course. I was with a party of 3 and we order the pizookie sampler. It was just perfect. The portions were much more reasonable for 3. They were 3 smaller ones and you could pick the flavor for each one.         The service is not great. Last time we were there the server had to go ask her manager questions for us that she didn't have the answer to. Simple stuff like for example the yelp check in deal. It's a discount off your bill and she was utterly confused when we showed it to her. I see this often in different places though.  A lot of times the employees have never heard of the deal or even yelp for that matter and they didn't know about it because someone (who should have) didn't educate them on it. That's fine but she literally had to go back and ask for us like 3 or 4 times about different things that she should've known more about. When we presented her with our check in deal, she had to go ask her mgr about it. She came back with a form for their frequent buyer program. We asked her if we needed to sign up for it to get the check in deal and she had to check with her mgr. She came back again and said no then on our bill there was an option to get a $5 coupon if you donate at least $1 to some charity. We signed up for the program and donated $2, Then we asked her how we get our $5 coupon and she had no idea what $5 coupon we were talking about. She had to go ask the mgr.  It's not her fault that she was just not properly informed about certain things. In the end we finally made it out of there after like 15 min of trying to pay the bill and leave. So, if you're in a hurry, don't get involved with any of that stuff, just pay and go while you can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=100

They both have similar menu items, burgers, pizzas, salads, etc. with beer at BJ's and cheesecake at CF the primary differentiators.

Sad but true. I remember as a teenager going to Red Lobster was a big deal, and the Olive Garden was the second-best option. So nowadays, having lived in and around San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and now San Jose... I definitely have a preference for delicious, less processed, less chain-like places. So I only go to one of these joints when my friends are insistent. Which, today, they were. Don't get me wrong. The food as these joints is usually pretty decent. There are a few items at the Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory chains, in particular, which are guilty pleasures of mine. BJ's has a few of my guilty pleasures on the menu. So I can definitely make do. Two stars for this location, however, because the servers were really inattentive. Like, REALLY inattentive. It was a thirsty day, my friends and I were there a VERY long time (over three hours), and I think we got a total of four check-ins and then had to flag them down for the check.

Munther H.,"Marysville, CA",32,61,170,1.0,8/25/2014,"I've been here a handful of times and have always had decent to better experiences. On this night I was left wanting more... I stopped in around 8pm on 8/25/14. The bartender was pleasant, i asked for a menu and promptly ordered something I had not had prior. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken, with mashed potatoes and a side Caesar.  After 15 mins, I received a virtually undressed salad, with what appeared to be expiring lettuce. I was in a rush, so i just downed the salad. My entree appeared, and what i saw on the plate were two tiny strips of chicken and literally 1 ice cream sized dollop of mashed potatoes. I literally looked at the plate for a minute in some what of a shock....The menu said i was supposed to have some chardonnay sauce, but I could barely notice any on the plate. The meal was bland and uninspired to say the least. I paid the 20$ for the meal and left a 5$ for the bartender. For 25$ I felt completely robbed.

Michaela C.,"San Rafael, CA",2,8,3,1.0,7/9/2014,"The most enjoyable part about this experience was the revolving door walking into the place. I'm not kidding. The food is subpar as everyone already knows, but the service in this particular BJ's location is some of the worst I've ever experienced.  First off, we didn't receive the waiters attention for 15 minutes, and after receiving drinks it took her 25 more minutes to take our order. Chris Harris needs some serious help running this place. Once receiving our food, we realized we didn't have any silverware, which is fine- as i understand it may have been hectic, but the silverware we then received was still dirty- and I'm sorry - but i am not one whom enjoys eating from pre- used forks that have been in other peoples' mouths. Unacceptable in my book. The food was mediocre but our salad was missing a main ingredient.

Rhi S.,"Seattle, WA",410,255,672,3.0,7/1/2014,"First of all, the photo used on this profile is of their location in the Westfield Southcenter Mall in Tukwila, Washington. The Northgate location doesn't look like that and it's kind of hard to find if you're inside the mall because the map is a little off. When I lived by their Tukwila location it was my favorite place! I was so surprised to find a BJ's when I was passing through the NorthGate mall in San Rafael so I really wanted to eat there. My husband and I went around 3pm on Sunday. It wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. Our table had water on it and I sat on a small piece of what I think was a french fry (my fault for not looking but if it's slow, you have time to wipe down your booth).  It took what felt like 10 minutes to just get the waiter to come and introduce himself and then another minute to get water. For such a slow afternoon, for anytime actually, I expect slightly faster service. Even when it's packed at any other restaurant it only takes a few minutes before someone comes to your tables ""Hi, I'm XX, I'll be taking care of you this evening.."" Our appetizers took about another 10 minutes and then our food came.. But I noticed that the people who sat next to us, who came before us, didn't get their food yet. It was a couple and two small children. They got their food when we were half way done with ours. If I were them I'd be really annoyed. We shared calamari and corn fritters which were super delicious. My husband had the parmesan chicken with just mashed potatoes and I had the parmesan chicken sandwich with tick fries. The sandwich was alright.. His food was way better and the mashed potatoes were kinda cheesy. It was so good! This place has dim lighting and a sporty feel with the televisions around. The food was good but that's about it.. I would not return to this location.

How can a kitchen give personal care to enough different items to fill about ten pages? It can't. But, be fair, this is a mall chain restaurant. Nobody's expecting anything special. But, how about something that doesn't taste goopy and sweet? Stick to the burger. They can't mess that up too badly. They seem quite proud of there own beer, which is mediocre at best, but they do offer a good selection of other independent beers. That's good. And while I'm at it, the TVs and attempt to be a sports bar is kind of a joke. There are a lot of TVs, but they are way high up, very far away and all have the sound off.

Clu C.,"Novato, CA",56,52,34,1.0,3/27/2014,"JUST CLOSE THE DOORS. We arrived around 6:30pm to a mob of folks waiting to be seated. But while looking around there were quite a number of tables/booths available. I asked one of the many hostesses if we could seat ourselves, because she gave us a wait time of 10-15 minutes. And then she graciously explained it is the policy to be taken to our table. Really? Because there were more people waiting to be seated than were actually eating! Moving on...we ordered and 34 minutes later our food arrived. We ordered: Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms (there were 5) $5.25. They were so shiny...greasy with cheese, nothing else. It arrived with our main course and were at room temperature.  Mini Pizza, Chicken Bacon Ranch $10.95. I do not suggest the deep dish for a mini pizza, as suggested by our server. Its all crust. This, too, was a room-temperature dish. Parmesan Chicken $14.95 The description and the actual plate of food in front me greatly differed. It described a parmesan chicken with a lemon, butter, chardonnay sauce. But there was no sauce. The broccoli had white ""dry"" spots on it as if it were cooked after having freezer burn. I asked the waitress if my dish came with this sauce, it did. The server said the sauce must have soaked into the chicken...Ya, that happens if it sits a while, I'm sure because SURPRISE it was not hot at all. All I've heard is that BJ's has great beer. So don't get your hopes set on a nice dinner.  My last comment, after the appetizers and dinner were presented on the table, our server quickly left us to eat. But we had to table settings. No napkin. No fork and knife. After a few minutes we flagged her at another table and asked for flatware. The table across from us flagged her and asked for their silverware. Hmmmm? Really. So not impressed. The servers are spread thinly in their sections so food will be delivered cold, there will be no silverware and good luck waiting to be seated.

D C.,"Fairfield, CA",1,21,4,1.0,7/7/2015,"My boyfriend and I came here to grab something to eat after visiting San Francisco last night since we already knew it was one of the few restaurants that stays open late and it was on the way home. We could've gone to our usual BJ's but it was a bit out of the way. I really wish we went to that one instead - considering that we're basically regulars and we've never had a terrible experience.  This BJ's seriously sucked. When we walked in, the host kinda looked at us like we needed to leave. We got there an hour before they closed, so I'm not sure what that was about. When she took us to our table, she basically just plopped down the menus and weakly said, ""Have a nice day."" Okay. Fine. Our server came by later on and I thought he was decent but something about him seemed off. I ordered the spaghetti marinara and he asked me if I wanted to add meat. I politely told him no but it looked like he thought it was funny that I only wanted noodles and sauce. Sorry, I currently do not eat meat? Anyway, our food came out like half an hour later. The wait didn't bother me because there were interesting activities going on in the restaurant to look at, so yeah. The guy who dropped off our food basically did what the host did - plopped the plates down and left. I was disappointed when I didn't see garlic bread on both of our plates because we both ordered pasta and the menu said that all pasta dishes came with garlic bread. We ended up asking our main server for it. After that, we kinda stopped seeing him for a while. Like, where did you go, man. When we were done eating, he was about to drop off our check but I guess some old friends came in at the same time. They were seated right next to us and we heard him having a full-on conversation with them for a while. It took him about 5 minutes to walk like 3 steps to drop it off. I understand that you miss them and all but we had to go and it was already close to midnight. As soon as we got the check, we immediately paid and set it out so that he would know that we were ready to go. Nope, still had to have a great conversation with his friends. I guess he saw how irritated I was because I was facing him, so he finally took the check and gave it back immediately. Overall, the service sucked the most. It would've been nice if the employees acted like they were happy to be there. At least acted like it. It also would've been nice if our server excused himself from the conversation to let us go. The food was okay, but it was something I couldn't have too much of because it got annoying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=180

We saw every waiter in the place hustling around but ours kept disappearing. Our apps came out the same time as dinner, we never saw the waiter between ordering and paying so there were no drink refills or a check in to see if our food was to par.

Mega P.,"Novato, CA",7,2,,1.0,5/4/2014,"Mind the reviews below mine, if you're someone whose restaurant experience depends on service, then trust me, you're probably not going to have a good time here. My group and I walked in on a Sunday night, the place was busy but not too busy with plenty of open tables and a short wait.  We were seated and then waited a full fifteen or more minutes to simply be approached by a waitress, and that was only after a very kind man sitting in the table next to us complained FOR US to the management. After complaining, it still took another 5 or 7 minutes before we were served water. Water. Something that's usually given to you within the first five minutes of walking in.  Our waitress's only response was that they were short staffed, which I understand and am sympathetic toward. Clearly it's also a management problem. As others have said before, if this place is short staffed on a Sunday night (not a super busy night but not quiet either), then they need to hire more waiters. I think I would hate being here on actual busy days. Usually BJs run like well oiled machines, this one ran like the rusty, spluttering car that's now sitting in your grandpas garage. Besides the subpar service, the food was also sub par compared to what I'm used to getting at a BJs. Our flatbread appetizer was disgustingly soggy. Had we not been so hungry by this time, we probably would have sent it back.  Our entrees were pretty bland, flavorless and doused with oil (clearly BJs is not the place to go if you're watching what you eat, but I've never had food this oily here either). Perhaps it's just those items we ordered. Be what it may, I'm not willing to go back and give it another chance anytime soon.

Jerry M.,"San Rafael, CA",2,6,,2.0,3/30/2014,"The new BJ's restaurant in San Rafael has been open for less than 6 months, and is still showing some rough edges one would associate with any full-service restaurant starting from scratch.  And yet I'm puzzled how the local BJ's has been unable to solve some of their staffing issues even after 6 months. Economic times are tough, and there are surely dozens of applicants for every job opening.  When Kohl's department store advertised for job applicants at their new store at San Rafael's Northgate Mall -- the same location as BJ's -- they had long lines of eager people, looking for work. The menu at BJ's is a wonderful fusion of brew-pub food mixed with Asian and Italian specialties -- offering an amazingly broad range of exciting tastes.  The issue in San Rafael isn't the menu: it's certainly got to do with an inexperienced front-of-house staff that just can't seem to stay focused on the basics of getting the orders correct, serving them while still hot, and remembering small details. I don't know if the problem of inexperience is in the kitchen as well, but I'd have to assume so -- BJ's seems to go for younger staff members with little or no prior restaurant experience. We were invited to a pre-opening private ""dress rehearsal"" meal (at no charge, except for drinks) as a result of my active participation in the San Rafael Chamber of Commerce.  My wife, a close friend, and I had a really good brew-pub meal, enjoying a wide spectrum of items.  We met some of the executive staff.  Service was timely, carefully orchestrated, and surprisingly good for a brand-new operation. Subsequent visits to BJ's revealed deeper problems that the General Manager and his key people were having with the inexperienced staff.  We've been back to BJ's four times since the pre-opening festivities, and things don't seem to be improving. On our most recent visit, this past Saturday evening, we arrived early in evening service, and were shown to our table promptly, even though we had no reservation.  The first thing I noticed were the employees who were hosts for the evening -- four young women, with nothing productive to do -- so they do what anyone would expect -- chat among themselves.  It took the four some minutes to decide where they would seat us. Our server was attentive and courteous, if overly solicitous.  We ordered our drinks.  My wife's coffee came promptly, but my cocktail order seemed to take an inordinately long time.  The server brought it only after I reminded her that I was waiting for it, when she came to ask if we had any questions for her, and were we ready. I've had this exact same experience at this BJ's before.  The bar service seems out of sync with the ordinary idea that drinks are served promptly when ordered, not after a random delay, ending only when the server is prompted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=180

So I figured I might as well see for myself!  We walked in the door and the hostess was so rude, no exaggeration. No hello, no smile, just said ""it's gonna be 10 minutes,"" so instantly that threw me off completely, but I assumed she was having a bad day and shrugged it off.  We finally get seated and our server is so bland and dry. Obviously, you could tell she didn't want to be there, so how am I supposed to feel welcome. We made a few drink orders, I got iced tea. Waited for 10 minutes without getting a drink. Finally got them, I asked for sugar. We got the sugar probably 10 minutes after we asked for it.  We made our meal selections. The server didn't even bother writing our orders down, which we assumed would be a disaster. My mom specified asked for Cajun shrimp in her salad. And she didn't get that.  My sister and I shared the Great White deep dish pizza. It was delicious! Though we got it way before the salad. Finally my mom's salad came out with salmon on top of it. After telling the food runner that it was made wrong, the runner got defensive saying that we were wrong and that salmon was written down, when the server never bothered to. So she took the salad back. We finished our pizza, still no salad. Our server hasn't come by to see how anything is. Finally, the ""new"" salad comes out. There was still  pieces of salmon with cold pieces of Cajun shrimp on top.  We were beyond frustrated, as well as other customers. We saw 2 tables around us get so fed up and walked out of the restaurant. So we complained to management. You'd figure that it would make things better, but in fact, it was the worst eating experience I've ever encountered. He was incredibly rude. He was crouched and hunched over, mumbling and wouldn't even let us speak. And when he would, he would cut us off. After complaining about my mom's meal, he cut her off by saying, ""well if that's the problem, the least I can do is pay for the salad."" Yes, that was the LEAST he could do. Just the overall tone of his voice and stature made my skin crawl. I don't understand how he even got promoted to that position.  At this point we wanted to leave. The server finally came by to apologize and asked us if we wanted anything else. We requested our check and that was all. 5 minutes go by and she's standing at the computer chatting with other servers and the manager. She finally comes back and everything was on the check, including the salad. We were so annoyed, frustrated, we just wanted out. My mom then followed the server to the desk to demand a change in the bill. Then the manager starts to act like a total asshole and tell her that it wasn't worth her waiting, that he would just take care of it. Though my mom gave the server her debit card, and was still with the bill. After the manager told her it was on him, he immediately snapped at her asking if she ""heard him?"" Then leading to her telling him that the server still had her card. As my mom walked away they all started laughing, which is completely ridiculous!

David H.,"San Francisco, CA",924,17,,5.0,5/13/2013,"A friend and I drove up from the city to see Wanda Sykes perform in Marin on Saturday night.  We decided to stop and grab dinner/drinks at BJs.  Unfortunately, in typical 'us' fashion, we didn't look at the time until after we'd been seated and ordered.  It was 7:55pm and the show started at 8pm!  We went into a panic.  How did it get so late so quickly?!   We flagged down our waitress and apologized.  We told her that we were running later and would need to leave.  She said the food was almost ready.  We had no time, so we asked her to just pack it up as a to-go/carry out order and we'd pick it up after the show. This was 100% totally our fault, so we paid for the meal, and tipped her. We made it to the show, and really enjoyed ourselves.  Afterwards, we made our way back to BJs to pick up our food, which we knew would be absolutely cold by now.  We were starving by this point so we didn't care. When we arrived, we went over to the carry out counter and had planned to just ask them to reheat it for us.  But after hearing our story, Chris (the manager) said 'Oh! We can't let you have this food - we'll remake it for you... please have a seat in the bar.' The food was remade, fresh - with no charge.  The service was excellent.  I am usually disappointed by chain places, but these folks really went out of the way to make the meal enjoyable for us.  Thank you, BJ's for making the night so great - we def need to get out of the city more --the Northbay has a down-home vibe that I can really appreciate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=200

May I begin with the fact that for a group of 3, it took 10 minutes to receive the waiters attention to receive water- and 25 minutes after receiving our beverages to order food. We asked another server if we could take our order, only to be replied with a roll of the eyes and grunt, as if we were not welcome in the establishment.

Kirk H.,"San Rafael, CA",15,39,7,2.0,7/12/2013,"When they first opened, BJ's was a comfortable local chain-style place. Burgers were the best. We would think of BJ's when we wanted a nice dinner. But the accountant's and consultants have nibbled away at all of the reasons why we liked the place. They have replaced the tables and chairs with booths. Good for them - maximizes seating space. Bad for us. They're awkward and just plain uncomfortable. The menu changes are more subtle. The salad dressings went from thick home-made to watery out of a bottle - in ever-smaller portions. The burgers have gone from a loose ground sirloin to a pre-made frozen patty consistency. Tasty menu items like sweet potato fries have disappeared. The menu is crowded with items that are suspiciously similar to most of the other chains - one wonders if they are sharing suppliers or just consultants. Good for them, I'm sure these moves save a lot of money.  The service? No complaints really. The staff know their jobs and it seems as if the kitchen is well managed. Food is fast and orders are accurate. Hmmm. Where else have I seen that? That place with Yellow arches I think... So when I get the $42 check for two entrees - nothing else - I have to ask - was this worth it? Not even close. Chains seem to have a life span and it looks like BJ's is circling the drain.

Came in for a last minute dinner with my boyfriend yesterday because we were starving before seeing a movie and we both really enjoyed our experience. I'm not a huge BJ's fan but we really enjoyed our food and the service last night. Gabriel B was our server and he was great! He recommended the black and blue burger for the bf and my boyfriend said it was one of the best things he's eaten at BJ's for sure. Gabriel had great timing (made sure we were taken care of but wasn't over-attentive), was funny and gave us probably the quickest service I've ever gotten at a BJ's without making us feel like he was slammed and needed to attend to his other tables. And it was a busy Friday night! I kid you not we got our appetizer like four minutes after we ordered it and it was piping hot. Entrees were also very speedy and drinks were brought to us promptly.  My boyfriend is a server in SF and I worked in fine dining in LA so we recognize quality service when we see it. I totally understand some of the poor reviews on here about bad service so I guess it depends on the server you get. Gabriel was fantastic and we also had another stand out server (blonde, skinny girl named Joanne?) a few months back so maybe BJ's is stepping up their level of customer service.

John B.,"Manchester, NH",261,433,1705,3.0,3/31/2010,"So this is Bj's.  Last night was my first time at Bj's. I went with a rather large group so we had a buffet. Unlimited pizza and cesar salad. I had a slice of Bj's Favorite and a slice of BBQ Chicken. That was it. Why? Because those 2 slices were soo damn heavy. I was rather hungry that night too since I didn't eat lunch. Anyway, the Bj's favorite is pretty much a combo pizza. It was alright but I would be just as happy going to costco and spending half of what I paid here for a combo. However, that BBQ chicken was beyond awesome. Melted cheese, tangy BBQ sauce, a little bit of red onion, some cilantro and some juicy chicken on a thick and buttery crust OH MAN! It is something I believe everyone should experience. My favorite part was the crust because it was buttery and had bits of burnt cheese (aka little bits of goodness). The cesar salad was just ok. For dessert, I shared a small triple chocolate pizookie with Ghiradelli. A sinfully sweet and doughy chocolate cookie with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and a piece of ghiradelli chocolate on top. What's not to love?  The atmosphere was rather pleasant. The restaurant was filled with warm tones (mahogany) and TVs on sports. It was a bit dim though. The service was pretty good. The servers were always at out table and refilling out drinks/the buffet table.  In short: My first impression of Bj's was 100% positive. The pizza is extremely heavy, order the BBQ chicken but skip on Bj's favorite, great atmosphere, TRIPLE CHOCOLATE PIZOOKIE!

As a former waitress, i have sympathy for servers, especially the ones in corporate restaurants.  But the service today was pretty inexcusable by any standards.  we waited for a table (though the restaurant was half-empty), and even though we were the only people there, we got one of those stupid buzzer things.  As for our waiter....after an awkward scripted greeting, he messed up my order, took his sweet-ass time bringing the one thing i asked for (a side of lime), then disappeared with our credit card for over 5 minutes after we expressly told him we were in a serious hurry (since everything else had taken so long). And the food - I've had better microwave dinner.  My partner got the teriyaki salmon lunch special.  Maybe they should just call it a side of rice, because that's essentially what it was.  A small handful of salmon ""morsels"" a few limp baby carrots, and a cloyingly sweet sauce that *sort of* resembled teriyaki.  I ordered the shrimp tacos, but ended up with the fried halibut tacos.  Two tacos, each with a double-fried super-tiny fish stick that tasted like it had been cooked in old grease, and a measley little handful of cabbage/onion.  I hadn't been expecting much, but wow I was sure underwhelmed.

Our food was good and came out in a timely manner.  If I stop here again when I am out and about I will update the review based on that.  Hopefully I won't get the same waiter.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=220

When I find a restaurant that already has a gluten free menu, I expect the wait staff and kitchen to understand what that means! My waiter was nice enough and did note the my order should be gluten free. HOWEVER, the kitchen plopped fried onion rings on top of my dish.(Balsamic chicken breast on field greens, no potatoes or onion rings. A different server brought the dish to my table. I pointed out the problem and he didn't know what I was a talking about. He took the plate away and said he'd find my wait person. We had already waited beyond a reasonable amount of time for our orders (3 of us). Now I had to wait about 10 minutes for the wait person to come back to the table so I could explain the problem. He said he'd get a new plate right away. It took another 15 minutes. My friends accompanying me were done with their meal by now and I wasn't served yet. Finally the meal comes. I started to cut the chicken breast and could not cut through. It was very tough and dry. It needed a steak knife. I tasted it anyway. It was horrible!!! Dry, tough, extremely salty and tasted very bad. Obviously NOT fresh chicken. Or they microwaved it to death. I couldn't eat it. I had the waiter remove the item from the check.

Daniel W.,"Los Angeles, CA",287,209,50,4.0,5/8/2010,"First--what's all this hating about BJ's food and service? I've eaten here a number of different times with different people. The service has always been fine, the food has always been great. Got it?  IF YOU LIKE DEEP DISH PIZZA, YOU WILL LIKE BJs. And there are so many kinds of foods that it's like the Cheesecake Factory for Men! Get this in your head: I'm serious about pizza, OK? The best thin crust is at the Cheese Board Pizza Collective in Berkeley. The best thick-crust is at Buddy's pizza in the Detroit area (yes, Detroit, not Chicago--I love Chicago but Buddy's is better. Period. End of story). I keep trying new pizza and so far nothing has eclipsed these joints. So--BJ's pizza is not the best in the world--but it is VERY GOOD, light thick crust (not too hard, like some Chicago style pies can be), light sauce and toppings. ""She Who Must Not Be Named"" declared it ""good enough to eat again."" I'm lucky if this happens once a leap year, so it's always an auspicious sign. My take: this is MALE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. It has an endless menu so you can get just about any kind of food (good if you're in a group and people can't decide between Italian, Mexican or Asian), an art deco-ish decor, but instead of cheesecake, there's beer--lots and lots of it. I don't drink beer, I don't care about beer (beer looks and smells like pee to me--I'm sorry, it just does), I came for the PIZZA. A friend took me to a BJ's in La Mesa--it was late and most places were closed (BJ's is open till 11pm on weekdays, midnight on Friday's and Saturday's) and I wanted pizza. It totally hit the spot--I was surprised at how good this deep dish pizza is. The crust is light, the toppings are good. It's quite delicious and reminds me of Numero Uno Pizza from when I lived in LA (Numero Uno, not to be confused with Pizzeria Uno or the various other Unos, is still delicious but it's only in the LA area). Look, I know this is a chain, often found at malls, and some haters will act as if I've piled praise on Applebee's (which, for the record, is home to some of the worst food I ever attempted to but then could not eat).  BUT--they do a very good job here, and when you want good deep dish pizza, this is better than even some of the ""classy"" places in the city (which I won't mention, because other people think they're great, and I think they're cardboard).  The prices are also reasonable--$10 for a small pizza that was a meal for two. (I just went to another deep dish place that will also go unnamed that wanted $20 for a similar sized pizza).  I have one complaint--the music is just too freaking loud. On the positive side, I asked them nicely to turn it down and they did. But the music at this entire mall feels oppressive--there's even music blaring outside. What's wrong with the world now--can people not go a few moments without music blasting in their ears? If they want that, don't they already have an iPod permanently attached to their brainstem?  TURN DOWN THE MUSIC, PLEASE (this goes for the cheesecake factory, too).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=220

Jade T.,"San Francisco, CA",156,325,1069,4.0,3/2/2010,"Awwww.... no love for BJs?! Been here a number of times since it's opened.. Only once was a so-so experience, all the other times were great! I had been hearing about BJs around the bay for a while, so I was really stoked to see on the Ngate website that open was opening here.. how exciting! New restaurants at the mall! First time we came, we actually sat outside because they were having some issues with the alarm, so the emergency flashing lights kept going off (LOL). So yes, party of six, chilling outside with the heaters in December, whatssssup!!  MENU: bigger than your average menu, but smaller than Cheesecake Factory. It also sticks to mostly brew-food minus a few exceptions. Choices were never a bad thing in my book, so I don't see why having more than 10 items on a menu could be a negative thing. FOOD: Yummy! Haven't had a bad experience yet. Portions are good and the pizza is on the deep side. Don't expect to get a thin-crust organic italian pizza and you won't be disappointed. They will also split it if you can't decide on the flavors. Bj's fave and Southwestern are the best. DRINKS: plenty of choices for the bois and the girls. If you're not sure on which brew to pick, get a sampler! Their own crafted sodas are pretty yummy too.. if you're in the mood for something sweet. ATMOSPHERE: treat it like a family friendly sports bar. It can get loud at times,  but it's spacious enough that you won't feel crammed in a small room with children kicking your back. Come with good company and you will have a good time. DESSERT: Pizookie. Need we say more? Yes, I know you can make it at home if you really tried, but it's not the same. It's a gooey half-baked oversized cookie with ice cream, to share with your peeps (or not). SERVICE: We had to ask once for a soda refill, but they have always been very attentive and efficient. Food has always come to the table still hot, and we have always had one or two people check up and see how everything is.  Chain or no chain, I'm a fan. For the price ($20 pizza, 1 appetizer and 1 pizookie  fed 4 - or you can just not overeat and stick to your well-portioned entree that comes with fries/potatoes or salad) and what you're getting it's worth coming. I prefer it to a lot of the nearby restaurants when I'm in the mood for some good ol american food.

Kai M.,"San Anselmo, CA",92,14,,1.0,9/10/2014,"This is the message that I sent to BJ's corporate offices as I could not find the local manager's email address. I was completely appalled at the lack of attention from my server, Joel.  Several times, he walked past my table and asked the one across from me if they needed anything and the one next to it.  However, he did not notice that the drink that I ordered was sitting barely touched and I did not have any water, nor was I ever offered water.  When my food came out, it was brought by a runner and I had to ask her if she would send my server over.  I then asked that he take my drink back and adjust it by adding orange juice (it was too strong for me).  He did that and when he came back I asked that he take my steak back as well because I didn't expect it to be as pink as it was.  I asked for medium well, which apparently looks different depending on the establishment.  He took the food back, albeit with a bit of an annoyed look.  He advised that it would take 10-12 minutes to make it well done and I was ok with that.  The only good thing that he did was actually update me on it twice.  I went to the bathroom and my food came out and was left on the table...not a problem. But, I never saw my server again.  After a while, a woman asked if I was ok and I said that I was ready for my check.  I had wanted to get dessert but, the experience had been so poor up to this point that I decided against it.  She brought my check, I put my credit card in the folder and she did not come back.  I had to get up to go to the host station and ask that they close out my check. It is absolutely ridiculous that a server would not offer water, come back and make sure my drink was ok, my food was ok, and upon having to leave, advise that he was going home and who would continue my table service.  And, there is no reason that I should have spent so much time waiting for someone's attention in a fairly empty restaurant. In addition, when my new steak was brought out, it was obvious that they served me the same mound of potatoes that they took away with the first plate.  I had taken two bites out of that mound and that is what was brought back to me 10-12 minutes later.  They tried to camouflage it by adding additional brussel sprouts.  But, I was served lukewarm food that had sat under the hot lamps rather than a fresh scoop of potatoes and brussel sprouts along with the new steak that was also a bit warm.   Overall, a terrible experience.  Absolutely terrible!  And, some server training should be in order for Joel and any others that think this was acceptable. For the first time in my life, I was reduced to leaving absolutely no tip.  Usually, even with less than par service, I leave 10% but, in this case, I couldn't see any reason to leave even a penny.

I place this blame squarely on the shoulders of management - where the hell is the GM and what the hell is he or she doing????  I often have to wait 10 minutes after I've been seated (and don't think I haven't noticed how one or two women together tend to get poor seats) to be given a menu and/or place a drink order. Every server speaks from a script and that script begins with a hard sell of their handcrafted beers. I'm on a work lunch, no beer, thanks. More often than not the food takes forever, and we're talking simple entrees here - a stir-fry, sandwich & soup, pizza & salad, etc. I had lunch there the other day with my work BFF and we barely made it out of there in an hour - and our $10 appetizer arrived AFTER our entrees and no we weren't comped for it and our server only asked us if we wanted refills on our drinks AFTER we were done eating. Ridiculous.  The service staff seems to MEAN well, but most of them (with a few exceptions) seem like this is their first restaurant job and that's okay, just TRAIN them. WELL.

I told her it was outrageous, especially since I didn't even eat it.  She argued with me again, saying that I was ""provided with food.""   The above was by far the worst restaurant incident I have ever experienced.  To be fair, I have been there before when the servers were friendly and attentive... unfortunately this is few and far between.  The food itself is decent, but not much better than Applebee's Restaurant.  I recommend the clam chowder and their various pizookies.

My sisters pasta was so old that the sauce had sunk to the bottom of the dish. The ""sauce"" that was so nicely ""plated"" with my salad was ROCK hard...no joke...I couldn't use my elbow grease to get it off my plate because I had no elbow room.

Could have been the seriously high ceilings? 6 - Even trying to pay took FOREVER.  7 - We were served AFTER other tables that had gotten there sometime after we were squished into that booth.

The place is so loud the waiter couldn't tell that we were discussing drinks orders and brought us 4 drinks. Luckily, our happy drinker liked both.  We ordered the spinach dip as an appetizer when we got our drinks.  15 minutes later we called the waitress over to order our main course. We thought we would add in the avocado rolls too.  15 minutes later we called the waitress over to cancel the spinach dip, reckoning that the rest of the meal was coming. She and the manager told us the chips were being cooked. We cancelled anyway and were promised a free dessert.  And then, we waited and waited and waited and waited. 20 minutes before we got our food.  My veggie burger came on wheat instead of sourdough, the waitress noticed immediately, I didn't care. They grabbed it and came back immediately with the sourdough version. Except...it was turkey. I've been a vegetarian for 20 years...And the fries were warmish. I told the waitress...  Twenty minutes later, after the rest of the party had wrapped up their food, I finally go my veggie burger. Over an hour since ordering.  We had a dessert. While I was eating my veggie (not turkey) burger.  The waitress was leaving and brought over her replacement. We got the check. Put our credit card on the bill. She walked by twice. Then she stopped coming by. Then she did and I waved. But, she must have studied hard in the school of ignoring people to attain expert level. She was a Jedi Master of ignoring customers. A PHD in ignoring the punter. The President and CEO of Ignoring Customers for Fun and Profit.  The place isn't even that busy at 10...  We scraped up cash and left. Hanging around almost 20 minutes to pay the bill....  Positives:  Avocado rolls are disgustingly good.  Cookie dessert is nice.  The first waitress was very nice. Probably the first day of her first job.  I didn't have to pay for the turkey.  The dessert was free.  I don't know what was happening in the kitchen, but I somehow don't think there's a brilliant yet temperamental chef there whose ""slow roasting"" special chip making recipe is world famous. I don't think it should take 30 minutes to slap together a veggie burger.  So BJs....the manager was nice, the first waitress was sweet. The food took hours to prepare. We got the wrong food. Both waitresses seemed new to the job, but the second one forgot that one tiny little task is to check in to see if the customer wants something or wants to pay.  One final tip. Don't offer a veggie burger if you can't get it right. It's not like I kinda don't like turkey and a mistake just means 20 minutes to wait while the rest of the party wraps up their meal...  One of our party has been to BJs in other locations and pointed out that they're not normally that terrible and it normally takes much much less than 2 1/2 hours to have a meal that includes a few of the items you ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=320

We waited another 15 min for our server to come over who I will say was really nice good personality and all but took a while to get waters then after about 15 min he came over to inform us that what we wanted was actually out and worked something else for us.

Peter R.,"San Rafael, CA",0,17,,2.0,11/4/2014,I used to stop off to meet friends here for a beer after work on a quite regular basis. There used to a woman who was ALWAYS there drinking wine. Not really a problem right except she had her young daughter sitting at the bar with her. The girl was perhaps 8 or 9 and sitting at the bar because according to the management was allowed since they served food at the bar. The woman was a lush and after perhaps three hours of drinking would leave and get in her car and drive her and her daughter home. I complained strongly to both the management and even contacted the executive offices of BJ's about this unsavory situation. The bartenders at the time all felt awkward serving her but nothing apparently was done about it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=320

Went for the pre-opening training session, and was delighted with the new restaurant.  I'm a huge fan of the chain, and think that this one has the nicest layout I've encountered yet! Even in ""training"" mode, the wait staff was 100% on it.  Super attentive (but not too much so) very clear, understood the menu, answered our questions, and served everything promptly with a smile.  And the food? Fantastic. As always.  Again, even in ""training"" mode, the kitchen staff nailed it. And really-who can turn down a pizookie.

From the beginning there was just a sense of us customers being in the way; since one of our party is disabled, we asked to sit at a table instead of a booth, and the hostess seemed as if we were inconveniencing her.  One loop around the section, however, and we sat in one of the many open tables. Our server was a trainee, so we cut her some slack, but 5 minutes later, we were taken over by another server, who was a little better... but 10 minutes after that, we were taken over by another server!  Granted, this last one was a pro, but it still was pretty weird.  Of course, because of this, our orders were messed up; two of our party members didn't get their sides, when we did get our food nearly an hour after we ordered.   Step up your game, BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=320
Jim K.,"Novato, CA",7,45,,1.0,1/9/2014,"I'm not sure what's happened to this place. I've eaten here a couple dozen times since they opened and ordered take out at least a dozen times and always had good meals and good service (once we had a large party and the service was terrible). However, I've been out of town for 6 months and I have no idea what happened here in that time but the food is absolutely awful.  First off, the menu changed and all of my regular favorites were gone...pot roast, meat loaf, sweet potato fries. I was persuaded to try the chicken pasta with cream sauce and it was just nasty...I've had much better meals at Denny's. The Chicken was burnt and the sauce...yuk, yuk, yuk...definitely not home made...came straight out of a bag or can and into a microwave. The friend I was with had a NY steak (because her fav was gone too) and the steak was tough and had a lot of fat. I've seen the negative reviews for the service here but in the past I always seemed to get good service. Many times I've left $20 tips for a $50 or $60 meal because the service was great. But this time we had a kid helping us that had absolutely no clue what he was doing. The place wasn't very busy and I had to ask him twice for the wine. And I knew the menu better than he did. Anyway, I chalked this up to one bad day, and that can happen anywhere. Definitely giving the place another chance. Which happened today...and now I won't ever go back.  I ordered take out...got my favorite teriyaki chicken plate with rice and veggies and an appetizer of chicken pot stickers. The sauce for the pot stickers was different...way too salty. And the chicken plate had very few veggies and chicken...mostly rice. I'd rather have had the chicken bowl they serve at Jack in the Box. Honest to God. And for the $25, I could have had 3 or 4 of them. I don't know if the management at this place reads the reviews or even cares, but I can tell you first hand the place has gone downhill...and fast. It used to be my go to place and now I will never go here again. If I ever end up here by chance, the only thing I would order is the pizza.  Whoever runs this place needs to wake up...you've lost a good customer because your food went from good to lousy.

On the other hand, BJs did live up to the brewery standards we have set since we moved to the Marin area.  How do you compete with 5-6 breweries within a 20 mile radius?  Just keep serving consistently awesome beer, that's how.  My suggestions:  The Porter, the Nutty Brunette and the Jeremiah Red.  Start with the Red and finish with the Porter.  Gotta love it.

For only being open and running for a couple of weeks in my mind they got the process down.  The menu weighs a ton. It can take you at least 15 minutes or more to review so I simply gave up and just looked at what everyone else around me was ordering and picked what looked the best to me.  I had one of the lunch specials. A small Cesar salad and 1/2 of baked potato filled with chili and cheese. It was unbelievable that the the potato was only 1/2 of an order.... it was huge. $6.95. My friend had the avocado spring rolls..... she said they were divine, but i was way to full to try to even take a bite.  The vibe is cool.... A lot of TVs to watch your favorite sports. My only complaint is the music... a little loud... but such a minor complaint that it would never stop me from eating there.  From what I understand they don't really take reservations, however if you call about 45 mins before you are going to arrive they will put your name on the list which could make your overall weight shorter.  Also they are open to 1:00 am on weekends. The Northgate Mall was smoking today. I guess they reopened on Thursday and from what I saw as I walked though the mall it looks good...  ....... and Santa is there!!!

Mike L.,"San Rafael, CA",0,26,,1.0,1/19/2010,"The way this restaurant is run is quite perplexing. I have been here for both lunch and dinner and continue to be amazed at how archaic the seating policy is. I do not understand having people place their name with the hostess and then be forced to wait for a table when there are PLENTY of available tables. Both times I have been here this has happened and everyone around me was also in awe of being forced to wait. On both visits I counted two people at the hostess stand who were standing around and not seating guests. Once you get seated, the service is nothing to write home about. The servers know nothing about the various  beers on their menu. On one visit they got my sandwich and beer order correct and on the other screwed up my sandwich order and gave me the wrong beer.  Food is typical chain restaurant fare. They have a large menu with enough offerings (pizza, sandwiches, pasta, salads, etc.) to please almost everyone. It's not terrible, but it tastes like it came straight from the Sysco truck. Only could see going to this place again if it were for a happy hour and they do a better job training their hosts.

The second time was last Saturday night and it was pretty bad.  We arrived at 4:45pm for dinner and were seated within 2-3 minutes.  It took the waiter 25 minutes to take our order, which is ridiculous.  Yes, the menu is large but it doesn't take THAT long to read it.  My husband and I shared BJ's Favorite Pizza and a cobb salad.  My son had a pineapple mini pizza and my daughter had the kids Mac N Cheese.   The pizza was ok - pretty blah.  The dough could've been cooked MUCH longer, there was hardly any cheese or sauce on the pizza and the toppings were skimpy.  My husband commented ""tastes like a frozen pizza, which it probably is!"" The cobb salad was pretty disgusting - it was litereally drowning in creamy dressing and they use a very tangy feta instead of bleu cheese.  The flavor of the feta totally clashed wtih the creamy dressing.  The salad was mostly iceberg lettuce, there was VERY little bacon or avocado.   My son's pizza looked decent - loaded with toppings, nice puffy crust and nice brown color of the crust.  My daughter had 4 bites of her Mac N Cheese - the portion size was huge though the cheese looked a little coagulated. I ordered the Cookies N Cream Pizookie and it was SUCH a disappointment.  The cookie barely covered the bottom of the pan, it was RIDICULOUSLY thin - NOTHING like the thick cookie pictured in the menu.  The cookie part also tasted like it wasn't even BAKED - honestly, it was barely warm and tasted like raw cookie dough.  The ice cream was fine, and the mousse on the top had a very greasy mouthfeel.   My kids ordered the kids' sundae, which was one small scoop of ice cream, a ton of whipped cream and NO cherry, despite the description in the menu.

Maybe the salad had been hanging around in the back of the fridge for a few days?  The waitress told us the sodas are brewed on site, sounded great but tasted like syrup with a few cups of added sugar in each glass. Really horrible beyond belief. No the server didn't ask if everything was ok or notice that the sodas weren't consumed by even a quarter of glass.  When we arrived for a very late lunch (around 2:15) the place was quite empty but the hostess was no where around. We waited for at least 5 minutes ---- shoulda' left then. Finally seated. Server came to announce her name and take drink orders. We had to ask what the soup of the day was. Nothing welcoming or inviting about the service, really quite horrible service. Couldn't drink the ultra sweet soda so asked for a glass of water, server didn't ask if anyone else wanted water. Water arrived with food stuff floating in it. Now I'm really starting to feel nauseous, this place is at the bottom of the pile when it comes to food, service, presentation ......  While still eating salad, the server wanted to know if we wanted to order dessert. When we told her no, she brought the check before we had even finished our entree. Do they train these people? There wasn't anyone waiting for our table, there were lots of empty tables.  Manager? Do they have one? What a disgusting experience!

Since it was my wife's birthday, she was told that she was entitled to a free Pizookie.  She order hers and someone else ordered dessert.  After 10-12 minutes no Pizookie and no other dessert.  Alas,  no waitress.  At this point I asked for the manager and complained about this lack of service.  He stated that it takes 10 minutes to make a Pizookie.  If this was the case, we should have been told.  Having been in the chefless restaurant business I was also aware that the desserts were premade and just needed to be reheated.  I asked for the check and was told we would be comped for the meal.  While I appreciated this courtesy, I would never return to BJ's in Northgate Mall.  It certainly cast a cloud over my wife's birthday dinner.

Kids will often not touch their food without Ketchup, so what's the point of bringing their food out if you leave off the secret sauce?  It took another 9 minutes (yes I timed her) and another polite request to get the required condiment, and then the bottle was nearly empty.  5. Complete lack of eye contact. That was kinda creepy. I saw lots and lots of kids, so clearly they know that they serve them. And their kids menu is pretty slick and jam packed with yummie choices. My meal was good. A little moister, and a touch more sauce and I would have been tempted to actually lick the plate clean instead of just eating every morsel. So give them a try.

It took 15 minutes for water to arrive (after the beer even) and our orders not taken after that. When the food arrived, one of the meals in our party was incorrect. The waiter said that it would take 15 minutes to fix and acted as though it was our fault that this happened. He even had the audacity to accuse us of ordering incorrectly even though he had repeated our orders back to us when we originally placed them. He never refilled our waters and did not ask us how the meal was until we were done. When we paid (in cash) he shortchanged us! It seemed as though he was almost pre tipping himself.

Leslie S.,"San Rafael, CA",5,31,,1.0,10/6/2011,"Ugh. This place makes me want to go home and cook a meal myself which is not what I expect when I eat out. Service is ...awkward. All the food takes forever to get to the table and I find myself rubbernecking to see if the waitstaff has left for the night. After anticipating my meal for about 40 minutes I was ready to dive in. Sadly its like swimming at the arctic circle and once you are in , all you can think about is getting out. Bland, boring, mundane flavors. The shrimp tacos were offensive in every way. (I'm sure its not the shrimp's fault) Is everything supposed to taste the same? On a positive note there are lots of beer choices. Maybe I went about dining here all wrong. Maybe I should have been pounding beer after beer during the extended wait for the food and everything would have tasted better.

Amy P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",637,264,1,3.0,1/26/2011,"So you have an idea to start a brewery and restaurant chain and you're pondering over names. You finally decide on the name ""B.J.'s"" ? I mean come on.  ( no pun intended) I have decided that the owner of this chain is either an ex-porn start looking to cash in after hanging up her .. uh ""talents"" or a gay men trying to slip one past the general pubic uh... public. In general, I am not a fan of chains, I have lived in metropolitan areas of L.A. and S.F. too long and am slightly spoiled. This place is really no exception, but my dad loves it and I have visited several times. Being that my girls and I love football, we decided to give this place a chance for the playoffs. It was fairly busy and the mix of people was comical. There is nothing to brighten a girl's day, like being hit on by an 80 year old Pittsburgh fan, yikes. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was very average, I could make better in my sleep. ( 2 stars) The hot wings however, were excellent. They were actually fried and not the gooey, soggy mess that most places serve up ( 4 stars). Our bartender was almost non-existent, we had to flag him down several times, even when he wasn't busy ( a pet peeve of mine for sure). The crowd was pretty mixed, but this is not exactly what I would call a cool spot, very suburban. To be fair, it is in a mall, so what do you expect? A very average experience, nothing to rave about, unless you count the several big screens and open atmosphere.. eh.  Don't be fooled people, the name of this establishment is sexually misleading. It is a family-friendly chain, not a cool gay club or hip sex shop. I mean ya, I made out with the a fore mentioned 80 y.o., but Viagra let us down.

So I'm assuming the horrible experience i had here must have been due to the management and service i experienced. Let me give you a gist of what my family and i experienced. 7:20 - We arrived at BJ's, and had a party of about, 19. We got seated around 7:45. 8:00 - Our Server comes to ask us what we'd like to drink. We mostly all wanted just water. 8:30 - THE WATER COMES OUT. Apparently, they import it directly from the alps. Seriously? Half an hour for water? Whatever. We get our order taken at the time, which goes smoothly. 9:00 - We're all still waiting for the food, even the appetizers. The waiter comes by, for the first time since taking our order, and we ask him what's up and why the food is taking so long.. (It's 19 people, i understand that's a lot. But it was NOT BUSY. So many empty tables. Was he the only one working?) He told us he'd get us bread while we wait. (We never got the bread.) 9:20 - Food starts coming out! But only 3 plates. 2 of which are appetizers. By now my family is PISSED and rejects the appetizers, they brought out cold macaroni for my niece and her friends, by the time they got a bottle of ketchup for my nephew, his burgers were cold. 9:35 - The rest of the food starts coming out. (after being yelled at, and talking to the manager, the server didn't come back alone, this time about 3-4 more came along with trays of food as well.) My aunt's food wasn't with that bundle though, so she waited but told everyone else to start eating. Her appetizer never came as well. Two of my brothers got the pulled pork sandwich (which did not look like pulled pork) and one lacked the onion toppings. By the time the server came back to ask if we were all right, his food was cold, and he asked for the onions. They took the sandwich and just added onions to it and brought it back. By this time, my brother was very upset about getting back his cold sandwich and just totally rejected it. Later on my sister ordered him the ribs and he enjoyed it. By the time we were halfway through our food, my aunts food makes its way out. As for the food, it was O.K. but DEFINITELY not worth ALL THAT TROUBLE. On the bright side, the Manager had told us we needn't pay for a single thing. So it was a free dinner for us, and most likely a $300+ loss for them.

Let me state that my review is mostly about the service in the place and only a bit about the food. I have eaten here several times and the service is always atrocious! Two times it was incredibly busy and so I chalked it up to the wait staff being overloaded. No longer! The hub and I ate here again tonight - fairly late - and the place was only 1/4 full. The ""hostess"" directed us into the bar area even though there were tons of empty tables. No problem for us, we found a booth in the bar area and had a seat. There were no menus or cutlery on the table. After about 5 minutes, a waiter showed up and asked what we wanted to drink. After about another 5 minutes, we got our menus and water. Then we had to wait. About 15 minutes before he showed up again to take our order. The food itself showed up about 15 minutes later but we had to flag down the waiter to bring us some cutlery (meanwhile the food gets cold) and the salad (drowned in dressing). We both had pizzas which were good but the meal was already ruined by the drowned salad and crappy service. At the end of the meal, we had to flag the waiter down again for the bill and to-go box. Ugh! Very disappointing. I hope he enjoyed the change I left him (75 cents). Here's a tip: You are a waiter! Wait on tables and you will earn a decent tip. Ignore a table and make your clients work to get your attention and you will earn chump change. Finally, while I can't stand the bad service I received tonight or on the previous occasions I visited this restaurant, I blame the management. The service is consistently bad and it doesn't matter where you sit or who is your server or what you order - it's all bad all the time. This tells me that the management doesn't know how to manage or train or doesn't care. My response? I am sending a copy of this Yelp review to the corporate office. I urge all other unhappy customers to do the same. I have eaten at several restaurants in this chain and have always been satisfied. Until San Rafael.

Maximillian M.,"San Francisco, CA",186,2203,1,2.0,1/12/2011,"It's got an overpriced Denny's vibe with fancy beer.

Melissa W.,"Novato, CA",75,16,7,3.0,3/7/2010,"The food is ok. It comes in big portions and is a little on the expensive side, but since I usually have leftovers, it's a pretty good deal. They give you free mozarella sticks when taking their surveys, and free food is always awesome. And their mozarella sticks are yummy. Their avocado egg rolls are delicious. They had a good sauce inside. Their fettuccine alfredo was yummy. Their deep dish pizzas are good, but I think they taste better with only one or two toppings. The crust is so big and tasty already that too many toppings doesn't taste as good. Fish and chips and chicken fried steak are also good. Their clam chowder is good. The chili has a strong beer flavor (in my opinion), but my friends would disagree. Their handcrafted sodas are also good, but I love my Shirley temples! My other favorite thing to eat here are the crispy thin fries. So yummy and crisp. Bad thing about this place is that when it's busy, the wait can be as long as an hour. Also, once you're seated, the service is usually good, but the food takes forever. I'd suggest only coming here when you're hungry, not starving. And it's a fun place to have a slow, casual lunch or dinner with friends or family. It's a cool hangout place. But if you don't like tv's and loud people watching sports, stay away. Otherwise, visit and try the fries! Oh I totally forgot. You have to try a pizookie (pizza cookie) if you've never had one. They have 4 or 5 different cookie flavors and they're all delicious. It's a fresh baked cookie that's been baked in a pizza dish. You won't regret it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=380
Chris O.,"Marin County, CA",10,37,,4.0,1/18/2010,"I had a completely different experience than most of the others. It's a restaurant in a mall, for chrissakes!   It's fun, the food is better than anything in the area, and it has a better game day TV than I have. Tasty food, lots of variety, generous portions, fresh veggies, ripe fruit, smiling wait staff, good beer...give them a break. The restaurant seems to be designed from the ground up with the customer in mind.  Booths are raised above the floor so you can see the game on the big screen TV over the heads of those passing by.

Tasaday L.,"Petaluma, CA",2,12,,1.0,7/4/2011,"On June 27th, right after finishing two challenging nursing finals and coming off a 5-week intensive summer program, several of my fellow nursing students and I went to BJ's to celebrate and relax.  We were there for three hours, not because we were enjoying ourselves, but because the service was so atrocious.  First, we had only one waitress for 15 of us, and she was new.  It took almost 20 minutes to get water, then even longer to get our mixed drinks, and to get food...what a joke!  Once we were served our food, they just ignored us again, and no one could get refills on water, or order any more drinks. We were all pretty patient, I thought, but when we finally complained, about two hours in, we got lip service from a waitress who wasn't even ours, then the runaround from our waitress.  Even after we said something, service and attention did not improve.  It took almost 45 minutes to bring out a dessert; one of those cookie things they make, so finally I asked for the manager.  It took her almost 20 minutes to arrive, meanwhile we're waiting for our bill, then to pay our bill.   And let me say this, this was not a busy restaurant!  I've worked in restaurants before.  There were...maybe...7 tables in the joint, and there were plenty of people wandering around doing nothing, including the day shift manager.   Once the night-shift manager, Pam, came over, she gave us lip service too!  Never introduced herself, or apologized for the service.  She just asked us if we had complained before this, and when we said yes, she said ""Well, you can't expect anyone to do anything if you don't let us know"".  It was pretty ridiculous.   I've been to BJ's before, with my husband, and it was ok.  The food is hit-or-miss, and the service has been bad, but never this bad.  I will not, on principle, ever go to ANY BJ's again, because I was so offended by my experience at the Northgate one.   I know they can make money by getting people in there and keeping them ripped, but in the long run they'll lose potential guests because of their lack of service and BS attitude.   I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=380

Nice family style atmosphere, good sports-bar type vibe, good food- except for the one fatal flaw - service. We have been here 5 times since opening and we have only had ""decent"" service once. The other 4 times have been a disaster. On our last visit it took us 45 min to get a table (was quoted 20), and from entering the restaurant took us 2 1/2 hours to sit eat and pay. The kids were climbing the walls by the credit card signing process. I even brought this to the attention to the manager mid-meal, and he informed me that it had been only 19 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we had received our food.

I do like the fact that it's a huge space and kid friendly but again, the food was totally ""average."" I think it's better to do fewer items better than a thousand items so-so.

Osgood F.,"San Francisco, CA",1,24,,1.0,5/3/2012,"I know going in that this is not going to be a gourmet experience, so I am not disappointed by the food--it is what is is and doesn't pretend to be grand. Sometimes it's horrible and sometimes it's perfectly okay--one just needs to know what to order (stay away from the avocado rolls they promote, they are repulsive; avocados should never feel mushy and hot to the palate). It's the service which is deplorable and I blame management for this.  The service was clearly not designed by anyone who knows anything about the fine art of service.  The person who takes your order should be the one who serves your appetizers, entrees, desserts and the follow through with the check.   There is a preface, a middle and a conclusion--these plot points should be delivered by one person; not a track team passing batons. This way the server feels responsible for his/her clients' well being.  But BJ's implements this idiotic practice of having someone take your order which leads to a mish mash of a cast of characters wandering around aimlessly looking for a home for the dishes they are carrying and by the time they find that home, the homeless food is cold.   Want a good laugh?  Watch poor lost Biff wander around with four plates of food looking for its destination.  It's a comedy of errors if you're in a good mood, but rage inducing if you're starving and grouchy because of it. Then, if the server is lucky enough to find the table, he or she does not know who ordered what and has to ask the patrons which is a big no no.  BJ's flunks basic service 101, and I blame higher management for this, not the servers.   The hostesses are young and indifferent, and don't seem to be candidates for Mensa.  The managers are played by Claude Rains, famous for playing The Invisible Man.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=420
An G.,"Oceanside, CA",2,12,,1.0,9/1/2014,"Where to begin. First I will say we have dined at many BJs locations and this was by far the worst and not up to the standard I was expecting. It's normally really good. This location would be closed where I come from. We were seated right away, which is good because that has never happened at any BJs I've been to (normally they are crazy busy), but bad because the place was empty (not a good sign). Though our waitress was really nice, we waited 10 minutes before we even got an acknowledgment. Finally we ordered drinks and food, 25 minutes later we got it. I ordered the Lemon Thyme chicken. Though the chicken was not dry, overall the food was not good quality. Everyone else had the opinion of ""meh"" on their food as well. No flavor, extra salty and blah/burnt. Though they are known for the pizza, not entrees. Service was uber slow (even though the place was empty). Add to that my daughter got lemonade that had no ice and was so warm, with condensation on the lid, I questioned if it had been sitting on the patio in the sun all day. It was 90 today. When we tried to return it for a new one, the same one was brought back with ice. The bottom of the drink was still warm, (imagine, hot lemonade). All in all, I will probably never eat at this location again. Applebees around the corner was better than this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=420
Natalie T.,"Rohnert Park, CA",10,9,1,2.0,9/28/2014,"I have nothing against the restaurant in general, but the service we received tonight was horrendous. I would like to start with the preface that I work in the restaurant business as a server as well, so I understand that it's very, very hard work. A friend and I went to BJs at northgate tonight and not only were we rudely greeted at our table, told that kitchen closed at 10:30 (when it actually closed at 11), but when we received our meal, it was upsetting. We opted to receive our full meal altogether (dessert and all) which wasn't a problem, but there was no chicken on the grilled chicken pasta, we ordered the mini pazookies and received full size (which we weren't looking to pay for), and then there was the french fry fiasco. We ordered a side of fries with our meal and it didn't come out, so when our server came to check on us she said they'd be right out with them. 5 minutes later she came to check on us again and said that she's so sorry they hadn't come out and she'd take them off the bill for us (which I assumed meant that we'd still receive them and she take the charge off for our inconvenience). After 10 more minutes of waiting AND our server dropping the bill, my friend approached the server and asked if we were still getting our fries, to which she rudely replied, ""No, we don't have any."" Uhhh, excuse me?? You didn't bother to tell us that 20 minutes ago??

I had to get a side of bleu cheese just to make it somewhat interesting. Apple crisp for dessert- Not that great either.  I asked  for the pepper mill for some fresh pepper on my salad and the response was that they've been looking for it all day. Really? One mill for three hundred people? Ever think of running out to the store and just getting a few to make it thru the night? Here was the kicker. The server brought out the check before we got our dessert!

May G.,"San Francisco, CA",17,170,15,1.0,12/19/2010,"I've been rating a lot of restaurants 1 star. It's really horrible when you spend (hard earned) money to eat out & the food is the shits!!! I went shopping with my friend this morning & we decided to have lunch here and it is so far one of the worse eateries I've ever been to.  First of all, we walked in and there was nobody at the hostess station, one finally appears & said they had no server yet (this is 45 mins after they opened for business) wtf? anyway, the party in front of us was told to go to the bar & wait. They had 2 children in their party & were told to go to the bar. Hmmmm So I asked if we could just sit at a table & wait for someone to wait on us. Poor thing, she had to think about it. I wasn't trying to wear her brain cells out with this difficult question.  The waitress was trying really hard. She said ""it's my pleasure"" after every request. I thought she was gonna pass out from too much pleasure. We ordered 2 appetizers & 2 items to share & was hoping to have leftovers for snack/dinner tonight.  Crispy Fried Artichokes: These were the best thing though it lacked flavor, the dip was probably ranch dressing.  Mini-Bruschetta: The tomatoes were tart like they put vinegar in it. I didn't care for the pesto dip that came with it. Clash in flavor Angel Hair Toscana: The chicken was tender but the entire dish had no flavor at all. I love food but I can't eat just to be eating BJ's Classic Combo: I'm not really a fan of deep dish pizza but this was absolutely GROSS, that's all I'll say. How the heck do you screw up pizza. Oh, did I mention the waitress did not bother to bring the Chez & peppers. So after paying $40 for a lousy lunch, I felt guilty about throwing food away so I packed it and went to look for a homeless person to give it to. After doing so, I was engulfed with guilt because what happens if he got sick like I did after eating it. So if you read an article about a homeless person dying of unknown causes on Geary Street in SF, you know BJ's killed him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=400

Mandy M.,"Petaluma, CA",0,2,,4.0,12/13/2010,"Honestly I dont understand why all these people who feel so disgusted with Bj's bother to keep returning. It's a chain, not a 5 star restaurant, what do you expect? Your probably the needy, rude, bad tipping customers that the severs and management dislike anyways.  Ive been there many of times. Yes the place is filled with all young servers but it keeps the atmosphere vibrant and fun. Its a great place for big groups and casual family dinners. Its one of the only bigger restaurants in the area so of course there will be a wait on a friday or saturday night. (Never too long). Ive learned from experience there that the servers really perform off the attitude and respect  given by the customers. lets face it no one really wants to serve needy people all night for minimum wage and the hope that people tip adequately.  The food is great. The menu has something for everyones taste. The prices are good too. The food does take a while to arrive, best to get a side salad or soup. (they come out faster then drinks sometimes). Or better yet if your in a hurry drive thru Burger King. But heres an answer for all the impatient reviewers: I asked our server one time why the food takes so long and she said that cretin stations get much more orders so it takes a little longer to produce so many dishes. Clearly believable. Defiantly try the Pazookie desert. It is amazing. Warm and gooey cookie straight from the oven with vanilla ice cream on top.  The management seems to be great too. In regards to all the ""training issues"" people are talking about. There are constantly new faces in the restaurant. There are clearly stronger servers then others at any given point.  Any questions you have or dislikes all the management members are on top of making your experience at their restaurant better.  I was there last night with family and we had a great time. When you are in good company and atmosphere who cares if your food takes 20-25 mins. Try the margaritas or mojitos.   And how have I come to conclude all of this? Because I am a faithful returning customer.

Bridget W.,"Laguna Beach, CA",55,129,26,1.0,5/25/2010,"Ewwww.  Sorry for the immature description, but I could not find an adjective better than Ewwww because that is exactly what I said out loud when I ate at BJs in San Rafael. The man and I wanted a simple lunch in the midst of a very busy day.  We ordered what we thought would be a simple, deep dish pizza.  From the looks of the deep dish photo inside the menu, it did not look ""deep-dish"" .. it looked like a cake of bread with some cheese melted on top.  Now, I normally would never even eat at a restaurant that has photos of their entrees (rule #1) but I caved.  I also asked our waiter if the photo was indeed accurate, in which he replied, ""No, this is a classic deep dish pizza and we are famous for it."" Apparently, they are famous for the pizza, famous for getting it WRONG.  The pizza came out exactly as I had feared.  A 3-inch cake of pizza dough with some melted cheese and pepperoni on top.  Ewww is right!  As my palette has grown since 3rd grade, I no longer find this form of food enticing, nor do I like being lied to by a waiter I am paying to service my table.

Douglas W.,"Austin, TX",0,12,,1.0,7/4/2010,"As it was 4th of July, we thought it would be nice to head over to Bj's for some good American Food but to quote another review ""WORST BJ EVER"" We called an hour in advance to be put on the waiting list.  The waitress said there was no wait but she'd put us on the list anyways. Well, when we arrived, despite telling the hostess we were on the list, we were told to sit.  After 15 minutes of waiting and observing the seemingly empty restaurant with at least 15 open tables, we were seated in the back corner of the restaurant.  Sadly, we had forgotten our Parkas as we were seated directly under a blasting air conditioner. As we sat shivering, our first waiter came by with anything but a bright smile.  He obviously seemed stressed out by all 3 of his tables.  As we were still waiting for my mother (who was changing clothes), we asked for three waters and for him to come back in a few minutes to take our order.  Too bad he never came back.  He obviously was too busy not taking other people's orders as well. My mom eventually came back after changing clothes and making a few phone calls (as my friend and I sat around for 20 minutes waterless).  Once she returned, we spent the next 15 minutes trying to catch the waiters eye.  But nothing seemed to catch his attention...everything from the stink eye to borderline flirting proved to be useless.  He obviously was working extremely hard at ignoring us freezing customers in the corner.  Eventually, my usually meek mother went up to waiter to ask for help.  Luckily, he told us the manager would be over immediately to help us out.  We thought a free dessert would be in our future.  Which probably would have happened if the manager ever came.   Finally, waiter number 2 came along and asked us for our drink orders in which we proceeded to order our drinks, appetizers and meals scared he would never return.  One appetizer came out which I ravenously scarfed down (mediocre bruschette)....more waiting......then another appetizer came out finally....Too bad it wasn't ours.  Luckily, a customer a few tables down yelled ""Did you just say Mac & Cheese? ""  Once the waiter dropped it off and left, they told us over their half-eaten entrees ""That was supposed to be an appetizer 25 minutes ago."" The rest of the appetizers and food came out together.  Too bad we had nothing but our hands to eat the food.  Our first and second waiters had simply forgotten we were civilized people and needed silverware and napkins to eat.  Luckily, a wandering cook stopped by (SERIOUSLY....A COOK....NOT A WAITER) and gave us some utensils.         The Mac and Cheese people next to us overheard and said ""We must have the same waiter because our service has been that bad all night."" My mother loved the Shrimp Skewers and her quesadilla (the kitchen made her appetizer vegetarian upon request....this is where the 1 star comes in). My Tomato Basil in a sourdough bread bowl came lukewarm.  Something I probably could have gotten out of a can from Safeway .  And my friends giant Chili Baked Potato had a tiny portion of flavorless chili.  She almost unscrewed the salt shaker to give her potato any flavor (Makes sense why the cook was wandering around now since the potato probably was just microwaved instead). My mother flagged down waiter number 1 for some boxes and the check.  He ran to the back and never returned.  Waiter number 2 came back with our check but no boxes.....Maybe they were out since the first waiter hadn't returned?  When we asked him for boxes again, he walked 3 steps to grab them from waiter stand behind our table.  We left without any apologies, visits from the manager or even a Happy 4th of July. I have never given a review under 4 stars but I would have given them 0 stars.  Apparently though you can't do that on Yelp.  Sadly, nothing is exaggerated as we are all servers in the restaurant industry.  Maybe a waiter from the restaurant will see this review and realize they actually have a job to do....serve food.

MM H.,"San Rafael, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/28/2014,"Does this place want our business or not? Love their burgers. Have not eaten in the restaurant for awhile, using predominantly the take out service which has been great. However, today (a Saturday) I went w/ a friend to eat inside. It was 12:30pm - 12:45pm:  lunch time. Entered main door. No hostess to be found. One couple already there, waiting also. Wait & wait. Another couple arrives, followed by a family. We wait, wait. Eventually a young woman comes. No apology for our having to wait. Takes her TIME logging onto the computer. She is incapable of simply asking how many in each party; instead, she must poke around and make (Lord knows what) entries into the computer. T-h-e-n, she made all of us wait while she ""organizes"" the menus. Slowly. We are all still waiting. FINALLY she begins taking each group to their table. The place is essentially empty. There is no excuse for all these delays and disorganization. We are the last couple to be seated. My friend reports that this same thing has occurred the last several times she has come in, no matter what time of day. The hostess is taking her time returning to get us. I finally spot her meandering (and I mean just that) back to us. I am now officially angry. I ask my friend if she wants to leave. She says yes, so we do. I'm pretty sure the hostess was clueless.

It's kinda a joke, if you want good food go to BJs, if you want good service go to Applebees. The service of our waitress Seirra is the worst we have ever had. Their was nine of us. They all trickled in at different times but we all ordered at the same time. We noticed her starting to get ticked off right off the bat as she asked us if we wanted to order For the 4th time before our guest arrived. Our guest came we ordered. No big deal. One of our guest had the wrong thing ordered and sent it back to get the right thing. She also ordered a pazooki to go and had it thrown on the table to her. We ordered another pitcher of beer and after 10 min. of waiting for it we asked again and she said ""Ya, it's on the way"" In a mocky tone of voice. After we were done with our meal we got the check. We told her we needed separate checks. She gave one of our guest a pen and told her to ""figure it out and write it on the back"" She gave snide looks at us the whole time, complained loudly to other co-workers and was very unprofessional. We also got gratuity added to the bill though there was under 10 of us. We were not suprised by this at the least. This is what BJs is about. They have very good food and the worst service I have ever come across.

Joy A.,"San Rafael, CA",9,9,12,1.0,8/26/2010,"I went to be BJs with my best friend to try the ever famous BJs Pizookie. After walking in and asking for a table for two we were offered the bar tables which we then denied. We then asked for a two top booth and we were told by the hostess there is no server on in the section hold on and another hostess can figure it out. The same hostess then proceeded to sit us at a half circle booth. Do these hostesses have multiple personalities since other people have experienced the doubling of the same hostess? Our server came over about five minutes later to take our drink orders then brought us our water 5 minutes later and took our order. Then telling us our pizookies would take about 7 minutes. I then asked the hostess for a kids menu to keep us busy while waiting she handed me one without crayons am I supposed to stare at it? 20 minutes later our pizookie arrived. Our server never checked back with us and eleven minutes later we FINALLY saw her again as she dropped off the check we never asked for. We then asked another server to find our server so we could pay she came back and said I couldn't find your server in the back.  Just today we decided to try take out considering dining in seems to suck with BJs hence the name I'm guessing. We ordered a classic baked potato no green onions add blackened chicken cheese and bacon, fettuccine Alfredo with chicken a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie and a meatball sandwich and was told they didn't serve a meatball sandwich anymore but it was clearly described under sandwiches on our to go menu which we pointed out and was finally told they'd make it we were told it would be about 15 min. 30 min later our food came out. We checked to make sure everything was there and left. We got home and the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken had hard noodles and no sauce half the pasta was dry. My classic baked potato which is described in the menu as butter sour cream and green onions had NO butter and NO sour cream only the added cheese and bacon for 1.95 more and the added blackened chicken i paid extra for. The pizookie was completely raw all the way through. In the restaurant it is served with two scoops of ice cream but to go is served with one on the side for the same price. The wings which were the only thing good about the lunch were fine. Which I guess is what you can take the one star for since there is no zero or negative stars allowed. We wasted our time and gas to go back and complain about the dry potato not including what was ordered and the raw pizookie to the manager as well as our complaint about our server and hostess the first time we came in. I asked for the manager and after asking twice he finally walked out fifteen minutes later. He like the servers didn't have a name tag or title so I don't know if he was an assistant manager or general manager and not introducing himself I don't even know his name. I told the manager our to go hostess told me when I told her about my potato not including butter and sour cream that ""she didn't know people ate butter and sour cream on their potato when they added other stuff"" I then said well if it's what I ordered you don't take it upon yourself to take it off unless I request it off. They didn't have name tags and we were told the names are on the receipts and we told him none of us received receipts with our to go orders which he then proceeded to say those can be produced at any time and are only given by request. So you can't check your order unless your request a printout to be able to check your order and see the servers name. I told him about the pizookie and he said they're not charging you for the second one are they? I said no but I'm still being charged for the first one that was raw. He said he would talk to the to go hostess Kristen to let her know that it's not okay to take items off people's orders without asking. And that he would take these complaints into consideration for moving on in the future. So no comp on the items that were the restaurants fault or for the next time visit that probably won't be happening? The management sucks and if I have free time soon I'll most likely be calling the district manager.

Patricia D.,"Woodacre, CA",135,29,,2.0,12/20/2010,"Really bad then good. I came in on a date with my boyfriend  an hour before a movie to have some appetizers for lunch. As I walked in we passed to the hostess wondering what was taking so long to even say ""hi""..I wanted to see if there was any bar seating because from past experiences here the bartenders are the only fast or timely waiters. There was no bar seating but there was a booth in the area... I had let the manager know that I had really slow service in this place  the recent past. Let me clarify folks this was not the first time. He assured me that he was going to make sure that didn't happen and that hoped I would change my mind about BJ's in general. He said he would send the server right out and let them know about my concerns. The server came right out. A blond server (I didn't get her name nor would I list it) she seemed fine ( but a bit put out like it was a chore to help us a little faster than what  she's used to ) but asked us if we were ready after we literally had sat down for like 1 & 1/2 minutes...we both ordered drinks right away & I ordered an avocado appetizer (pretty good). My boyfriend asked for a little more time. When the server came back we ordered the rest of our appetizers and I specifically asked her for the check when the food came out as we were seeing a movie soon...she agreed to this...said ""no problem, my pleasure. After that, she pretty much dropped the ball and fell way short of excellent customer service. I figured a table that comes in tells you specifically what they want, pretty much orders right away & asks for the check right away would be the easiest table ever. I have waited on tables myself ( at many different restaurant mostly fine dining but one or two chains in the past) and to me that, with  my customer service background is ideal. The way she preceded to treat us was either because she was lazy, overwhelmed (& it was not packed in there), clueless, or stupid. But it was obvious to me that she didn't care. When she stops back at our table while we're eating the first appetizer...to ask us how we're doing and I can tell that everything I said to her was forgotten...I started to get a little worried and uncomfortable at the thought of reminding to do her job especially since after she left the last time we realized I had no silverware or napkins...we stopped her and asked for a napkin ( the cloth roll up with the fork & knife inside)...she rushed back with bar napkins and rushed away. Then our 2nd and 3rd appetizer came out and I still had no fork or knife I asked the busser that brought our food out if he would kindly get me a napkin with silverware please and he came right away with a genuine smile and a joke which definitely lightened up the mood of such bad service...I also asked him to remind our server that I had asked for the check. He was so nice but when she came back with the check she also brought two roll ups with silverware. I couldn't believe it. I was like is going on here and why do I feel like a guinea pig for her messing up during my lunch on my date?!  My boyfriend said to laugh it off because it was so ridiculous and almost comical how bad the service was after I had already said something of my concerns beforehand. I partly agreed with him but I was starting to get just really disappointed and my appetite to finish our food was decreasing and after the server came with the check I was just wanted to leave. The whole experience had been completely ruined for me and since it was my turn to pay the bill I especially felt robbed for having been treated or neglected so bad. I usually tip really well. I left a $3 tip for the crappy server and I shouldn't have even left that.  In conclusion I was so displeased that after our meal I spoke briefly with the manager about the horrible performance and experience and  actually gave a $5 tip to the manager give to the wonderful busser/ or food expediter who was really the only person that ""took care of us"" that we could see.  I appreciated the manager being concerned but I had to leave to catch the movie and I was way to upset to address the situation that day. The next day I called and spoke with their senior manager who exemplified all the classic signs of excellent customer service. He promised to address the concerns of such inexcusable behavior and tried to rectify my dissatisfaction and offered me a way of compensating for my bad experience which made me feel better and not so taken advantage of. I just hope the service there improves because it's convenient to stop by when we're at the mall or seeing a movie and the food is not that bad. i just want to come in and relax and not worry about telling a server to do their job and not ruin my experience there. We'll see I give them another chance because it is in my neighborhood and I want to like their establishment. The fact that the manager addressed and dealt my complaints really does make me feel better and makes all the difference:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=440
Kira M.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",0,27,2,1.0,4/5/2010,"Unfornately I will never go to another BJ's again.  I understand that it can get busy sometimes and service can slow because of that, but It wasn't busy when we went. The food was ok, but cold and we had 3 or 4 different servers, none were very friendly or attentavive.  So we came in about 8 pm for dinner. There were 4 of us and we ordered a three corse meal.  the first server took our dink order and our meal order, then we never saw him again. So our appatizer came out in about 10 min which was expected, but we still had no dirnks. The kid who brought the apps took our drink order again and went and got the drinks. We waited for the beverages to come before we ate the apps. about 30 seconds after the drinks arrived someon else had brought out our salads, which we were not ready for yet. This was about 8-10 minutes after the apps had come out. they also forgot one salad.  At this point the tabe was full with our salads drinks and appatizers and plates. They brought the missing salad once we had finished the appatizer. Not one minute later they brought our dinners. We hadn't even got to our salad yet. We had only been there maybe 25 minutes at this point. No one ever came buy the table again until they brought the check, without asking if we needed anything else.  We  wanted to eat our salads before they got soggy from the dressing, so in the meantime our dinner's had become cold, although the fries were cold when they arrived.   The service is some of the worst i have ever experienced, and even if the food is ok I can't get over how bad the service is. I have worked in the reaustrant industry for many years, and I know it really isn't that difficult to give good service. I understand that it nice to get off early sometimes, but don't be lazy and give bad service so you can go home.

When we got there she said 20 minutes and it took an hour. After waiting 30 minutes to order the food came 40 minutes later. I would say that the quality of the food was poor. The food had been reheated several times. You have to beg for refills of your drinks. I differ with other reviews that said BJ's is kid friendly. By the end of our 3 hour dinner our kids were spent and lying on the floor. To top it all off we asked for our bill several times and it never came.

The large open dining hall and clean furniture gives it a good appeal, but everything else seemed lacking. We were seated relatively fast, considering how busy it was, and our server introduced herself to us. this would be the last time our server would say more than 5 words to us. The tv's were way to high up on the walls to even make out the scores of the games, so unless your at the bar don't expect to pay full attention to who's beating who. The waitress mixed up my drink with my fathers, a simple mistake, but when we asked for some sugar it took about 10 minutes to get to us. We then were given a clam chowder, which we never ordered. Turns out it was for the table next to us, and since we didn't touch it our neighbor took it willingly. The same table next to us was seated about 5-10 minutes after us, but they were nearly done with their meal before ours came. My california chicken sandwich was good, but the wedge fries that it came with were cold. Is it that hard to heat up frozen fries??

Sara never came back to our table to appologize for her mistake that the order was never placed. This was my third visit to BJ's. 1st time was the free meal. I ordered the Jambalya which was good, needed more flavor. 2nd time was bar service only. Service was terrible. I was quoted several prices on beer.

The bad service is not just on the waiters either. On another painfully slow occasion we had not been helped for 15 mins and when I looked over to one of the computer terminals, there must have been 3 wait staff and as many managers laughing and joking not paying any attention to the floor.  I actually had to get out of my seat and go ask for service! For as long as BJ's has been open they should have worked out how to properly run the place. It's a shame as it has the potential to be a great place.

The restaurant is very nice, I liked the items on the menu, and I did kind of enjoy my food, but waiting for over an hour is a bit ridiculous. First of all, I expect to get my drink before my meal or at least when my meal is being served but I guess I should not have expected much when I ended up waiting almost 40 minutes for my meal. Finally, a meal but no drink. Thus, I had to re-ask for my drink when I was served my food. When I realized 15 minutes later that it was not coming I went up to the bar and asked for it there. They did not provide me with one, but told me that they will alert the waitress, so I instead asked for the manager. In a few minutes, he finally did bring me my drink, but it was the wrong one. 25 minutes after I received my meal, I finally got my soft drink. I ended up being even more disappointed because my food was very cold by the time I took my first bite. I just do not understand how difficult it is to bring a paying customer what they order. What was worse is the waitress became very rude after the manager was sent to our table. Overall, not matter how much I may like the menu, I will never be returning due to the service. I refuse to pay to wait that long and I feel as if I did more work than the waitress.

What really got me though was this; Friday night at about 8, we arrive and are told that there would be about a 30 minute wait for a table of 4. We agree and are handed our buzzer. We sit not more than 5 feet away from the girl who just put our names in the computer, and after 50 minutes of waiting, and watching several groups we were certain arrive after us get seated, we ask what the problem was and why our name had never been called or our buzzer activated (We had heard other party's called by name over the loudspeaker) The girl says our names aren't in the computer, and at this point the GM walks up and asks what the problem is. We tell him and he makes us out to look like the jerks by saying ""Oh well we will seat you right now,"" and turns to the other group and says ""You have to wait, these people need to be seated"". We got glares from that group...The GM then proceeded to try and offer us free appetizers or drinks.

Mark E.,"Novato, CA",78,4,,2.0,2/24/2010,"Took the fan here on Sunday night for the third time. I looked and saw all the poor reviews about wait times, and I chalked it up to bad experiences for those people. Isolated issues.  However to my dismay, this seems to be a real problem here now.  We called ahead as the hostess told us to, but that didn't help. We had to wait aost a half hour. I am a patient person, but with two three year olds out after bedtime, it started to he a nit much.  Once we were sat, the waitress took our order (we had plenty of time at the hostess station to peruse the menu), and then made us wait 15 minutes for our drinks. Then almost another half hour fir the food.  Eating out should be pleasant and relaxing, this was just tiring.  The food: Wife and mother in law had the shrimp tacos. No raves. No complaints.  The kids had the Kraft mac and cheese, so...they liked it.  I had the chicken Alfredo pizza. I have had a few pizzas here in the past, and u enjoyed them. This was lacking in any flavor other than copious amounts of garlic. Which I guess was the pizza cooks idea on how to try and hide the overly cooked and dry chicken.  With little kids in Marin our options are limited, and we were glad to have some place new to go, but it seems that BJ's has decided to rise just to their neighbor Apple bees standards. I don't like eating there, and I don't think I will be eating at BJ's much either.

Strange name aside, I was surprised by the atmosphere and sheer size of the place. I literally felt like I was in the city (SF-Jillian's anyone) and was instantly happy a place like this had finally made it to Marin. Thank you! The owners did a great job decorating the place with super high ceilings, hand painted murals and a very cool custom bar! Large TV's are scattered throughout and this would make a great place for a sports fan. We were told the wait would be about 15 minutes but we were seated in five, this place was buzzing on a Wednesday night. As we followed the hostess to the table I quickly glanced at everyone's food and it all looked good. I ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls and BJ's combo pizza, and my wife had the Fish Tacos. Everything was great! The Egg Rolls had a perfect spicy zip to them and were accompanied with a great honey dipping sauce. The pizza was a puffy, deep dish pizza with great toppings.  And the tacos were good, although I prefer grilled or baked fish as to fried. We also tried the beer sampler and the Blonde, Hefeweizen, Pale Ale and Stout were our favorites. We felt the other beers were a little too sweet for our tastes. They also make their own soda drinks, which is pretty cool. They accommodated our one year old very well.

David F.,"Concord, CA",53,375,1603,4.0,5/4/2015,"In San Rafael for the weekend, we stopped by BJ's on a Saturday night, not knowing what to expect. Even though we were early, and there were no big games, it was pretty packed. Yelp says the noise level is ""average"" -- true, if average is a dull roar. It was definitely loud in there. BJ's seems to be a cross between a sports bar and a family restaurant, and judging by the quite varied demographics eating here, they are pulling it off. Big-screen TVs line both walls the length of the restaurant, not just above the bar. This actually is kinda cool: I liked checking out the A's game at points during dinner. So even though we are not typical sports bar people, other than the noise, it wasn't a bad experience. The true surprise was the food: it was both reasonable and quite good. They actually had one of my favorite meals, clam chowder in a sourdough bowl, and they pulled it off. The chowder was excellent and the bread was freshly delicious. My wife had Mediterranean tacos, and thought they were quite good aside from the cilantro. My clam chowder bowl was $9 and the Mediterranean tacos were $9.50. A super value at that price for the quality. Quiet, intimate dining, this isn't.

chris c.,"San Rafael, CA",7,19,,1.0,9/3/2017,"Earlier tonight I had my second bad experience at this restaurant, and I'd like to write up why I'm not going back.  The short of it:  I just paid full price for food I didn't eat, and my gf and I ended up sharing her food. Pitiful. Date night, 9:30pm.  We arrived to a half empty restaurant and full waiting area.  The hostess eventually got to us and then seated us about 5 minutes later.  We'd requested a specific type of table (many of them available) and the hostess apologized for forgetting when we reminded her after she tried to seat us at the table we'd specifically requested she avoid.  No biggie, but not a good start. It took 15-20 minutes for our server to get to us, and we ordered drinks and entrees in one go.  The poor lady was doing her best to cover a huge number of people, and she apologized for the ""ridiculous wait."" Our food was dropped off about ten to fifteen minutes later.  My girlfriend got some burger thing that was pretty good.  I got a California Club, and it was  gloppy with cheese, soggy with something else, limp and yet also stale/overwarmed, and somehow still lacking in flavor.  I decided to send it back and have them refire it or send out something else, but alas, I wouldn't see my server again for 25-30 minutes, and every attempt at waving her or another incredibly overworked server down went unheeded.  I had some of my fries but hardly touched the club sandwich, and ended up eating some of my gf's burger.  Super rude of me, but I was hungry and had waited long enough. Eventually my server came back, about ten to fifteen minutes after we'd finished, and asks if we need a box in addition to the check.  I said we didn't need a box because it was bad, pointing to my nearly untouched sandwich.  She disappears for a good while before picking up my card and charging the full amount for the meal. After I've paid she finally asks what wasn't great, and we told her. She later offers to bring us a cookie dessert, but dinner was already well past over for my gf and I still hadn't had a real meal, so we declined.  We'd been there forever.  Meanwhile, the only other table in earshot, apparently also on a date, was letting the server know that they never did get one of their two entrees, and that they had to share, too. It was when we got up to leave that a server, moving super quickly, almost knocked over my girlfriend.  That sort of thing happens, but he didn't apologize or even slow down. I believe in providing feedback to businesses, so I quietly went to find a manager. When he came out to talk with me I told him a very brief account of what had happened, and also pointed out that their hostess station had been unmanned for the last five minutes and that there was a huge line.  He apologized but didn't really ask for specifics.  Nor did he offer to comp anything.  I would have refused the comp, I just wanted to get out of there, but when a customer tells you that he didn't actually eat dinner because his food was so bad and didn't have a chance to let anyone know because his server was AWOL, it's pretty crazy to think it's OK to charge full price for something not really delivered.   The guy admitted ""yeah, tonight has been kind of a disaster,"" and I do feel bad for everyone involved because they appeared to be trying hard and doing their best, but the whole thing was unacceptable.  Date night ruined and I'm out cash for food I didn't eat.  Customers waiting to check in started leaving after the hostess still hadn't shown up, and I sort of envy them.  At least they're not out way too much cash and time.

The waiters were nice guys, but they seem completely disorganized and they don't know the menu or beers very well.  It is a huge menu, and the selection of beers is incredible, but the downside seems to be that it's too big for the staff to manage.  It also took about forever to get our beers--we got them well after the entrees had been served, though it was nice of the waiter to apologize for the wait.   The food is just okay.  I had a burger that was decent, my wife had a good pulled pork sandwich, our friend had pasta alfredo that was vey average, and the kids had mac and cheese that is literally Kraft out of the box.   My bottom line is that Marin already has two of the best brewpubs in the Bay Area--Marin Brewing Company and Moylans.  There's no reason for us to go back to this place at all.  The food and beer and service are better at MBC and Moylans, so we'll keep going there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=240

Anne H.,"San Rafael, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/3/2014,"Good food & cocktails are great! Service is beyond pathetic. Very lame. They are challenged by cleaning tables, seats & bathroom. After waiting about 15 minutes the waiter attempts to clean table/booth seats but smears fries and food into seat and continues cleaning table with same dirty rag. When I mentioned the fries on the seat still he just did the same thing. I had to take a napkin to wipe up the crumbs. No one apologized for forgetting order etc. I could go on but why bother. CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING IS NEEDED BY AN EXPERT...NOT THE MANAGERS THERE.  Last week I was there with some clients and the fries were served cold. 2 Attempts at steak and both were disgusting. Overcooked like leather the first time, 2nd time Medium-Rare but tasted like some horrible disguise for beef. Corporate...what are you thinking??? Seriously, many of us have been faithful patrons but quite frankly are tired of poor service and sometimes bad food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=240
Margo L.,"Novato, CA",0,21,1,1.0,3/24/2014,"Tried this place for breakfast. And ordered the breakfast pizza.  Really  disgusting and unappetizing.  Place was decorated nicely and service was great, but the food. Meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=240
Vira P.,"San Francisco, CA",335,1141,1135,3.0,7/12/2012,The service is slow and the food is of mediocre affair.  But it's a good meeting spot for drinks and appetizers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=240
Robert B.,"Boise, ID",109,151,20,4.0,6/6/2014,"Standard chain style restaurant, kinda like a TGI Fridays but a bit nicer inside. Totally forgot to order a pazuki which is what they are known for but they did have some killer appetizers! The ahi poke and the corn fritter balls with a chipotle aioli were amazing and the wings were very good too. Definitely a great place to come with friends and watch the games while eating some good apps",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=240
Wes T.,"Corpus Christi, TX",188,1314,37,4.0,12/7/2009,"This type of place, and this joint in particular, would normally only get 3 stars from me. I don't go into the overdone, modern, grandiose drinking hall. Like a bar on steriods. However, this bar is getting a 4 star review because they upped the game a bit with their brews on tap. Anyone can get all the Budweiser and Miller products, but BJ's actually has some authentic Belgian beers out of the keg, which is very welcome. They earned their fourth star for this review specifically because they have a sour beer there, which is next-to-impossible to find on tap in America. Good for you, BJ's. Beyond the beer, there's not much special taking place here. Sports bar with big TVs on the wall, kind of a vacuous crowd that seems uncomfortable in such a large and loud room. Look for lots of local Marin wanna-be knuckleheads with their Ed Hardy shirts and hoodies to glare at you from time to time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=240
Lars S.,"Novato, CA",62,441,708,2.0,2/1/2014,"This place tries to copy Cheesecake Factory with some of its menu items, but doesn't even come close.  The service is usually mediocre and the food mediocre at best.

Mika S.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,6,3,1.0,4/29/2015,"I have to be honest here. My boyfriend and i went here tonight on a whim. First off it took about 15 minutes before anyone acknowedged us to get us drinks. Then one we placed a drinks and apps order it took another 15 minutes to get the drinks and another 15 minutes to get the apps. So if we are counting we have been siting for approx 45 minutes with no dinner. Anyway. my boyfriend and i ordered mojitos. his was a regular and tasted mostly of lime juice and mine was a strawberry and tasted mostly of rum. it was SO strong. It began to taste better as the ice melted. As as the meal progressed, our dinner finally arrives and his wonderful bacon cheese burger has hardly any cheese and little bacon but plenty of pickles and is well over cooked. and I ordered the atlantic salmon. the veggies were cooked to mush and the salmon wasn't cooked in the middle, but at least it was warm. Only the ends were actually cooked, so at least i was able to east those. We have come to BJ's a couple of times, telling eachother, maybe last time was a fluke and this time will be better. we order different things, just to be sure. and those last couple of times, we have gotten sick. I sure hope it doesn't happen again. You would think I would learn!! right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=240
Talicia S.,"San Rafael, CA",0,13,,2.0,5/13/2013,"Fun place, good service, but pretty bad food. Two people in my party had the steak and lobster and it was really bad.

Dan H.,"Novato, CA",2,4,,2.0,1/9/2014,"Been here quite a few times over the past years, good food , sometimes slow service , but they always seem to get the job done. Stopped by last monday during the 49ers game, bar area was packed, looked around and plenty of tables were available, asked the hostess how long the wait would be to get a meal. she looked as us and laughed, then she told us ""You are going to be here a while"" After hearing this my wife and i looked at each other and walked out, probably never to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=240

Richard T.,"San Francisco, CA",26,41,7,3.0,3/8/2014,"I like the food and beer here, but the management isn't great. For example, it takes forever for the teenage hostesses (yes, multiple) to get you seated. Also they're constantly blaring awful music at top volume from the bar, making for a disconcerting dining experience. I can say that the wait staff, while quite young, have all been quite good, even if they only check in every 20 minutes or so. This is a good place, it just needs to work on the front desk and the bad music.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=240
Steve L.,"San Rafael, CA",2,7,,2.0,1/14/2014,"I keep giving this place another chance, because my kids love it. But the service is spotty, at best, and usually much worse than that.

becky b.,"Corte Madera, CA",0,11,,2.0,7/13/2014,"Fun place for a teen birthday dinner. The hostess and server were great.  The food is very average but could easily be better. I had a New York steak which was covered in a rub that tasted like Lawry's salt. Ugh.  It would have been fine with just salt and pepper!! And sear a bit longer. (It was on the pale side but rare ) Too much dressing on the salad. There, two easy things to fix.  Bar drinks were good and wine by the glass decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-san-rafael?start=240
