Lisa K.,"The Woodlands, TX",233,967,2395,5.0,10/28/2017,"Awesome waiter services. We came in with a party of 8 to watch several of the games! Penn state & Astros!  There is no bad viewing seat! There are flat screens in every corner. Great spot to watch the games.  We had such a great time and no one rushed us out, even though there were people waiting to be seated. A whooping 5 hours at BJ Brew. We spent so long here, we had 2 waiters and more drinks and food! Great night! Thanks for showing excellent customer service and welcomed large parties!! Go Astros!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah
Natasha L.,"Spring, TX",248,83,54,2.0,9/4/2017,"I haven't had BJs in a good couple of years and was craving their pizza and pizookie badly. So decided to satisfy my craving. Eh.  There was group of 4 of us. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, buffalo chicken pizza and pizookie. Our dip came with stale chips. That's one. Our pizza, was low on the toppings- no celery for sure and one of the slices was literally just bread with some sauce and cheese. Now the pizookie... this is where I really got upset... Chips being stale, fine. Pizza short on ingredients, fine. But then we're informed that they were out of chocolate chip cookies! That's the real sad bad. After much crying and cursing, we went with the macadamia nut pizzokie. It was aite.  Our waiter- he was MIA for most of everything. He asked how we liked our food and I told him it wasn't what I was expecting and not that happy. Instead of sending over the manager, he handed me the bill. Oh get this, they didn't even comp for the stale chips!  Next time I am craving a pizzookie, I'll stick to making it at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah

Penny W.,"Spring, TX",50,13,2,1.0,12/18/2017,"Bad Food Experience at BJs last night.  We wanted deep dish pizza and were at Porto Fino so we went there. It was the worst food I've had in  a long time.  Avacado Rolls: mushy outer roll, avocado mushy and brown, no flavor. Didn't eat it.  Wedge Salad (didn't think you could make a bad one but they succeeded): hunk of iceberg  -not even sliced into a wedge - with outer layers wilted - not crispy with a few TBSP. of toppings.  Pizza: ordered a Deep dish Veg pizza w half chicken. It arrived with full chicken. Sent it back. Next one came as ordered. One bite and I was done. Yuck. Mushy crust. I suspected there was no sauce so I scraped the the toppings off my piece. No sauce AND No cheese. I scraped the toppings off the whole pizza - same thing!  We called the server over (who was very good) and showed the Pizza to her and she was embarrassed. She said there was a new Pizza chef who thinks he makes the best ever. I requested she take the pizza and show it to him and suggested he re-think his idea of ""best Pizza ever."" The Mgr. came, I explained our whole food experience and told him we were long time customers but will not be returning. He offered weak apology and walked away. No effort to rectify things whatsoever.! We had to ask the server to take the pizza off the bill. No other comps. Unbelievable. So sad. We went to Russos as we were still hungry and to satisfy our Pizza craving .  This BJs location lost 10+ year customers.. Russo's and  Crust  will keep us returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah
Indira M.,"Kingwood, TX",18,45,31,3.0,12/14/2017,I had the broccoli cheese soup and I have to say it was way over salted. I added the beet and goat cheese salad from the appitizer menu and that was lovely.  My friend had the chicken lettuce wrap and the nibble I tasted was really good.  I also thought that the wine was overpriced and thus the OK rating.  Our server was good but a bit slow.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah
Jen D.,"Houston, TX",231,9,1,1.0,1/9/2018,"I do a lot of catering for my job and I used this restaurants online website to place a catering order for pickup 24+ hours in advance. I received a confirmation email saying my order was placed. When I arrived at 11am the next day (when my order was supposed to be ready) they didn't even have the order and gave some excuse that the 11am pick up time is the reason it wasn't received? Ok so why would the system even allow 11am as an option? I spoke to the manager and he never apologized or even offered to comp. anything from my order. Needless to say, I was 30 minutes late to bring my customers lunch. I spend at least $200/day on catering and my money will definitely be spent somewhere more reliable with better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah
Kevin V.,"Spring, TX",45,138,257,1.0,4/3/2017,This is a review based on take out...  Service 1 out of 10 Food 6 out of 10 when the order is correct which is very rare.  I would say if you do dine here please don't do take out unless it's pizza. any other order you get even if it's not modified it's highly probable that it will be wrong. Another thing is don't pay online because they won't be able to find your check. I ordered a Chipotle Glazed salmon and it came dry as a bone with 0 sauce and it was highly disappointing. I give this place chances time and time again but it's definitely time to sell the stock and if I eat here it'll be out of late night dine in desperation.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah

Suzanne M.,"Conroe, TX",0,17,,1.0,12/26/2017,"My family eats at this restaurant a lot. However, the last 4 times to be exact have been bad. I order potato skins and their tortilla soup. Tonight they brought the potato skins out burnt they had little to no cheese they forgot to add bacon and no chives, so disappointing. My soup was luke warm. My husbands chicken wings did nothing for him. Needless to say we won't be back again. I can check another restaurant off my list.

R X.,"Conroe, TX",0,14,,2.0,12/22/2017,"We went on a Friday night and were seated pretty quickly.  The menu I got was sticking together as if the plastic had recently been wiped down but not allowed to dry.  The salt shaker was greasy.   The avacado egg rolls were rather flavorless and I didn't care for the sauce that came with it.  We weren't given plates for the appetizer and asked our rather scatterbrained waitress for some.  When they arrived, one of the plates was wet and another one had stuck on dried food. I got the baked ziti which was pretty good.  One person in our group got a chicken dish which she said was room temperature and not hot.  Overall, average food with horrible service that's twice what I would expect to pay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah

For this late nite adventure.. selected from the healthy options on the menu...  Brussels sprouts (while not healthy) were meh, chicken Mediterranean tacos good and  the side dish not so much and the seafood tacos (I was told) were ok but for me.. total turn off as they smelled like a can of cat food.

There were a lot of new items. We ordered a couple of appetizers. My wife got the Sriracha brussels sprouts and I ordered the bar house meatballs. Both were very delicious! I highly recommend them :-) Our waitress was super nice, and the general manager came to our table and visited for a minute which was also really nice. I'm liking this BJ's.

The bleu burger has been AMAZING both times.  The bacon was crispy in all the right places and the bleu cheese was aged to perfection. Loved the roll (tad of butter and toasted to perfection), as well as the glob of mayo on top.  It came with fries which were actually kinda salty, but decent nonetheless.  I'd definitely stop by here and give it a try!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah
Nikki S.,"Houston, TX",5,439,976,1.0,8/26/2017,"I love BJ's restaurants but I will never go back here again. The worst part was when melted cheese and mushrooms were stuck to the skillet on my smores peanut butter pizookie. The best part? When we asked for a box and our waitress returned to throw dirty napkins from a different table onto our food and took it away. She said she would be right back with a box so she clearly heard us ask to take the leftover pizza home. I love their pizza but this was the worst I've had at any location, half of the pizza was drenched in cheese while the other half had barely any. The service was terrible (even though it was almost an empty restaurant), and the food was just as bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah
Renee Y.,"Spring, TX",46,106,1,3.0,10/21/2017,Good food and drinks. The pizookies are great. The prices are just really high for what you get.

Raul B.,"Houston, TX",83,119,178,2.0,5/21/2017,"This place is horrible. Service is slow and inaccurate, we had to wait over 5 minutes to be seated when no one was at the restaurant because the staff was having a conversation. After we finally got seated it took another 10 minutes for someone to even show up, after repeating my order 3 times (she was obviously playing with her device) we had to wait an eternity for drinks and food to arrive.

I waited for 15 mins for them to bring my food out which wasn't that good. Then they couldn't even cut me a break on my food. It was there mistake and I'm the one who ended up paying for there mistake.

Bradlee T.,"San Antonio, TX",4,10,,1.0,2/13/2017,"We have been going to BJs for years in San Antonio and College Station and have accumulated a ton of points on their Premiere Rewards program. When we moved to Conroe, we adopted the Shenandoah location. For a while, everything was great. The past couple visits have been atrocious. We visited this Saturday at about 3:00pm. There were empty seats everywhere but we were told there would be a 15 minute wait. When you see this at a restaurant, you know its in trouble and you probably are if you chose to eat there. We did anyway.... First, when we were finally sat, no one greeted us forever. It took staring down the manager across the room to get her to come an get our drink order while our server hurried over to not get in trouble. When our drinks arrived, there was dried food caked to the bottom of the glass and food caked to our silverware as well. Disgusting. There was also food all over the floor and paper napkins still stuck in the booth.  When my salad arrived, there were all sorts of little pieces of food in it that were clearly from another dish. There was a green gookie substance and several noodles that did not belong.  Against my better judgment, we ordered a Pizookie because I had promised my son and is too young to understand if I didn't order it. We ordered when they brought our entree out and ended up still sitting there forever waiting. Once we were finished, we still waited forever to get out check.  This restaurant has gone down hill. We really love the concept and other restaurants in the chain so we keep giving it another chance, only to be disappointed every time. The same managers are always running around fixing problems, discounting checks, delivering food, and doing their employees work for them. Perhaps if they hired better servers and actually managed the restaurant, their restaurant would get back on track.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=20
Allannie B.,"Spring, TX",0,4,1,1.0,6/3/2017,"I came here tonight with my family and had great service at the door but as soon as we were taken to our table it was another story.  Hannah (our server) didn't approach our table until 20 min after we were sat. This was after I asked one of the hostess' for some assistance as my table hasn't been approached for drink orders. She went ahead and took our drink and food orders which was very considerate of her. We had seen the girl working in the section we were sitting in pass us by many times helping out the table right next to ours. Not sure if there was a shift or section change and our server was not informed that we were hers to take care of but we were clearly next to the table she was helping out for quite some time. There was no apology from her.  When the food came to the table, we weren't asked how our food was until we were almost done and asked for the check. She finally apologized and said the server that had our table prior to her was cut and she wasn't informed. If we had been told ahead of time, this review wouldn't have been put on the yelp page. She avoided us the majority of the time as if we weren't there. Food is usually pretty consistent so I never have any complaints on their food. Service, on the other hand, wasn't the best. We were all annoyed with the whole situation. Service has never been an issue with this place until today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=20
Sour Prunes P.,"Houston, TX",2,61,42,5.0,2/22/2017,"First time trying their GF pizza and it was delicious! The crust tasted like regular pizza crust...very crispy and light. It went well with the pepperoni and jalapeño I got on it. The pizza sauce is one of THE BEST--so flavorful! The spinach artichoke dip is ohhh sooo deeeee-lish!!! Warm, creamy, melt in your mouth goodness!! Also had their freshly baked to order GF pizzookie with vanilla ice cream and it was soooooooo goooooooooood!

Every time we have been here, we have great service, great apps (we like the mozzarella sticks, chips with queso, and the spinach dip), great vegetarian pizza with a really nice crust and cheese. Their strawberry lemonade is fantastic, as is the peach drink. The pizookie is awesome, as are the strawberry beignets. The Mac and cheese is good, but I don't like the salads that much.

Phil M.,"The Woodlands, TX",28,92,228,4.0,12/29/2015,"Took the family out for lunch. We tried five different dishes plus an appetizer. The restaurant was well lit, organized and clean and the staff were very friendly.  Cost wise you ask. The average item we saw on the menu was 10-12 dollars and the portions were good size. So you can bring the whole family out and not break the bank.  To start off we had the calamari appetizer which came with two sauces. We all (5) thought it was pretty good.  I had the pepperoni flatbread. It was good ... But ... You better seriously  love pepperoni because it comes loaded with it. $11 My wife had a salad. It looked ok, but I can't comment because real men don't order salad as a main course. It should only come as a side dish in my opinion.  My son had a sandwich with large cut fries (see pic) he thought it was great.  My daughter in law had the chicken Parmesan.  She loved it, but, looking at it I would have given it a just ok.  Lastly, my daughter had a burger with fries. It was quite large and she loved it. This is a burger place so if your a burger person your in luck here.  So overall the place was a win win, especially as a family place to go to. Good food at a fair price.  Check out the pics.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=20

Consistency among chains with menu, quality, ambiance, and waitstaff. Always happy with my visits. I have been to more than 15 sites now.

Desiree S.,"Houston, TX",0,10,3,2.0,8/26/2017,"I will start this review off by giving credit to my waitress, Kierra. She was really awesome and made my experience so much better than it would've been just based on the food alone. The salad was mushy on side with brown (she didn't bring it out, someone else did), the garlic green beans were meh, and the ribeye was lacking even salt or pepper. Thankfully she was a gem and brought me a new salad. I didn't say anything about the green beans until the end, but something tells me she would've done something about that too if I had told her.

Andrew W.,"Spring, TX",378,21,48,4.0,12/6/2016,"BJs has been a family staple for a long time now. I'm not really sure why it doesn't have a higher rating. The menu is huge and the waiters are (usually) top notch.  This time I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. I almost never order chicken at restaurants and probably would have never picked this for myself, but one time my mother let me try hers and it had me foaming at the mouth. This meal is amazing!! For best results, substitute the mixed vegetables with Asparagus.  If you end up taking my recommendation please send me some yelp-cash...it's totally a real thing.  The avacodo egg rolls are still good but they now put siracha in them. It really takes away from the taste of the dish IMHO. They went from a 10 to about a 7.

Went there yesterday for a late lunch (party of 3)due to a band contest at the stadium across the street.  There was a group  of band kids (8) quietly waiting when we got there - our party was told 20 min wait.  Those band kids had already been there 15 min when we arrived.  As I looked around, I noticed a few large groups of the same band kids only they were seated with a band parent - the group of kids waiting  did not have a parent with them.  Now we are coming up on 40 min wait which means this group of very polite quiet band kids have been waiting almost an hour.   During this time, small groups were coming in and getting seated.... Not sure what was going on but the band kids finally had to leave.. OMG. I DO NOT  BLAME THEM - we followed them out.  I have to wonder if the mentality was "" they are just kids and no parent to speak on their behalf"" I'm sure if you offered 2 tables for 4 they would have jumped one that's!  Shame on you BJ's ...

Jan C.,"Spring, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/7/2017,"My family and I just walked out after receiving THE WORST customer service I've seen in a while!!!! First, as we drove up, it was slightly raining and there was a young man walking a lady to her car with an umbrella. I figured since he saw us pull up, he would offer to allow us to use the umbrella but not. That was ok because we had two in the car. Once we got in, we were seated and I purposely looked at my phone to check the time to see how long it was going to take them to help us. After sitting there for a minute or two watching all these servers walking back and forth and another lady setting up a table, as she walked by I asked if someone could help us. She said let me get your server. She walked off and went and got someone but instead of helping us she helped her put more forks on the table. I didn't say anything. I just continued to watch. She then went back to the front and stood there, looked around and stood there. We waited and no one ever came so we got up to leave. Oh yea, another couple came in after us and were helped before us! As we got up, another lady said she was right behind us because they brought her food and didn't bring her drinks. As we were walking out, the hostess said have a good night. I told her I would with no thanks to them and told her what happened. By the time I was done the manager was following me out the door to hear what I had to say! My husband is a 21year RETIRED US VETERAN and I don't take it lightly when people mistreat him.

I had the Lemon thyme chicken and substituted quinoa for the brown rice.  I'm not sure what happened with this dish, because it's what I always order.  For some reason there was a bitter taste and not the usual lemony flavor I love so much.

Willie And Melissa E.,"Conroe, TX",160,26,5,3.0,1/28/2017,"Our family visited this restaurant for my son's birthday recently. We had a party of 10. We attempted to call ahead and get on the list just in case, but they wouldn't take call aheads over 6 people. When we arrived, we were greeted by the same hostess that took my call earlier. She was welcoming and friendly. We arrived quite early in the evening, so fortunately there wasn't a wait. We only had to wait about 5-7 minutes for them to get our table set up. Once seated, our waiter was very attentive while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. We ordered the fried cheese and calamari to start. Both dishes were delivered lukewarm. We've visited this restaurant many times before and had much better. They tasted as though they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a little too long. I ordered the American bacon cheeseburger and it was good. My wife had the chicken tortilla soup with a salad. The kids had chicken and burgers. The rest of our family got various dishes from fish and chips to the steak. I didn't hear any complaints from anyone. The thin cut fries are yummy and crispy and they always offer a heaping portion with the meal. The only negative seemed to be the temperature of the food. We like food brought hot and very fresh, but all the dishes seamed to have been sitting under a heat lamp a little too long waiting for someone to run it to our table. Another negative was that our dishes were brought out maybe two at a time. Some of us had our food in front of us but had to wait for the other dishes to be delivered before we could start eating. Throughout the meal, they began seating more large parties around us in our same waiter's section, slowing down our service immensely. For some odd reason they sit all large parties in the same area in this restaurant with the same server. Because of this, we were done with our meals and waiting for what seemed like forever just to order our desserts. Being that it was my son's birthday, we couldn't leave without a pazookie. It is a must if you visit this place. The cookies are baked fresh and served with a generous scoop of ice cream. Delicious! Get the mini for yourself. The regular size is more than enough to share with one or two more people. Once we finally ordered our desserts, we waited for probably 10-15 minutes (to be expected for this dessert) but when they brought them out, somehow everyone but my son got their dishes. His came out about 5 minutes later. The server was in the weeds with no backup, so we sat without drink refills for way too long. In conclusion, the food is mediocre, the desserts are amazing, the service is okay (but they need to spread out the big parties to other servers) and the restaurant was clean and well maintained. I will be back with my family for dinner in the future, but I doubt I will return with a large party.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=40

It reminds me a lot of Granite City Brewery, actually. I was pleased that our party of 7 was almost immediately accommodated, and our waiter was attentive.  Everyone seemed fairly pleased with their food, but no one was really blown away. I had the Asian chicken salad and a bit of my man's pizza. The pizza crust was a bit tougher than I expected and there wasn't anything special about it. My salad was alright, but I'm always looking for some kind of greens or lettuce other than iceberg or romaine. I felt like the chicken portion was scarce, and the dressing was overly sweet.  Our party also had a few beers that were fine, but nothing new. Two standard IPAs, and a hefeweizen that was more like Oberon with an orange slice. Not necessarily true to character, but enjoyable enough.

Jeff N.,"Hockley, TX",30,69,24,5.0,10/3/2015,"We went to BJs on a Saturday night for a friends birthday dinner. BJs is a big restaurant and has plenty of seating. Tables, booths etc. they have a huge menu (in my opinion that is too big with to many choices.) BJs menu is priced well and they are between a Red Robin and a TGIF. Not really low end and not high end. My rule of thumb is if you want a steak you go to a steak house, you want fish go to a fish house. BBQ well you get my point. They have everything on their menu, sorta like a jack of all trades but master of none. With that said I was pleasantly surprised that what my wife and I ordered was very good. She ordered the Ahi seared tuna salad and I ordered Jambalaya. She said her salad was very good and the tuna was also very good. I was not expecting anything but mediocre but my Jambalaya was as good as any New Orleans type restaurant I've been to. Others at the table ordered Fish and chips, Fried chicken and a steak. Everyone at the table said their food was very good. Our waiter was good and helpful with suggestions and we never ran out of drinks.

FoodMakes M.,"Houston, TX",1,88,28,3.0,7/18/2016,"Drink - watermelon basil margarita.  Too much syrup though the alcohol content was on par.  It would have been more refreshing if it weren't so thick.  I attempted to let the ice melt, but it didn't help the texture much. Appetizer - sampler of mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, garlic parmesan boneless chicken wings, and spinach artichoke dip with chips.  Cheese sticks and marinara met expectations.  Nothing bad to say.  Avocado rolls had too much avocado and not much else.  The tamarind sauce on the side is what made it worthwhile.  Very great flavor that I used to dip the garlic parmesan bites into.  The chicken was tender and lightly breaded, but could have used more sauce drizzle.  Some what dry but rectified with the tamarind sauce intended for the avocado rolls.  And the dip would have been okay had it not been dried out.  I prefer creamy and less clump so I can actually get it on the chip without breakage.  $17.95 for the platter was a bit pricy. Side salad - romaine, iceberg, and spinach.  Strawberry vinaigrette was light enough.  Normal enough salad. Main entrée - Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos.  Decent size and good amount of protein.  Just seemed like something was missing and it was very dry.  I asked for cucumbers and red onions to be removed....but think they also left out the cilantro.  Reasonably priced at $9.95 since I substituted the side grains for the side salad. The desserts were limited.  I didn't bother to try the pizookie they seem to be known for.  They had options but it just didn't seem like what I wanted to complement the meal.  Overall, I enjoyed that our server knew the menu well.  She never hesitated in answering our questions.  She was however not very attentive and we could have used refills on waters.  At the end of the meal, we waited too long for her to return and take payment that we decided to pay at the take out register.

Waited 30 minutes for our waiter just to ask for our drinks. While she came by to take our drink order we ordered food, because who knew when she would be back around. We waited another 45 minutes for our pizza to come out. While the pizza came out, we had no silverware to eat with. We waited another 10 minutes for our waiter to come by and ask us if we needed anything. We had no silverware to eat with. Our food had gotten cold by this point. While we were eating the waiter did not come by to ask us if we needed a refill which we were out on drink. She came by asked us if we wanted dessert and we said yes, and she just bought the check out thinking we were done eating and having drinks. Had our dessert and left. Did not want to be had this place with the waiter not offering good service.

Julia K G.,"Montgomery, TX",1,18,9,1.0,5/25/2017,"The following is a copy of a letter that I composed and sent to corporate offices that I never received the consideration in a response in ---------- Forwarded message --------- Date: Tue, Feb 3, 2015 at 11:38 PM Subject: Inappropriate attention to detail To:  02-03-2015 Location of complaint: The Woodlands TX, 19075 I-45 South, 600, Shenandoah, TX 77385 I am stating a formal complaint regarding the disregard in professional accommodation to a client's needs in diplomacy to mutually resolve unsatisfactory food and beverage requests. My grievances include several circumstances that occurred the evening of 02-03-2015, and are described as follows: All soda beverages were not carbonated and service was unacceptable in having the drinks replaced. My son and I were never able to have this issue resolved and much to my dismay I was furthered charged per drink, so I was inconvenienced into dispute resolution with a manager to elevate the problem. My primary complaint and concerns are the result of an order of ""Garlic Chicken Wings"" and when we realized that the inside meat was frozen and there was visual evidence of blood. I brought this to the waiter's attention and he offered to have them ""cooked up more"". I declined his offer and advised him to remove the order from my bill. Unwilling to do so, It was necessary to request a manager. Unfortunately our waiter was not attentive in compelling this particular individual to join us at our table or the manager refused to do so. The disconcerting  attention of the manager proved to be apathetic and noncompliant in professionally offering concessions for the unacceptable circumstances in a regrettably disrespectful and argumentative approach. The manager denied the problem and informed me that he would agree to recook the item or replace it with the same item, but refused to replace the order with another selection associated with the uncooked meat. I declined this offer and proceeded to inform him that I would insure that my credit card company decline the charge to BJ's if the fountain drinks and raw meat appetizer wasn't removed from my charges. The manager begrudgingly then removed the charges from my bill. I was not offered qualifying options to rectify or compensate me for the problem. This circumstance was my first and last encounter with the ""BJ's"" brand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=60

Rocheryl T.,"Secaucus, NJ",0,2,,1.0,10/7/2017,"I only gave 1 star because of the final waitress we had which I will get to later. This was by far the worst experience I have had at a BJ's. This was the Woodlands location. Let me start by saying I made reservations a week in advance so they were aware of the large party. However, the size of the party had nothing to do with it. We arrived at the restaurant and still had to wait 15-20 min to be seated. When we reached our seats we waited another 15-20 minutes before we were informed that they were backed up and our waitress would be with us. After another 15-20 min still no visit from our assigned waitress, Kierra. After approaching the hostess stand to ask who our waiter/waitress was I was told she was wrapping up with another large party and would be with ya shortly. After about 5-10 min the HOSTESS comes over and says she will have to take our drink order. We requested to put in orders for appetizers and were told that she couldn't take appetizer order, I understand you are a hostess. We are 45 min in and  still no visit from Kierra. I only know her name because we were told that's who our waitress was when we requested to speak with a manager.  We are now an hour in and the hostess brings waters to the table behind us but don't serve us. She just sits them on the table behind us. 1:10 we decide to flag down Alexis who has been diligently waiting on her tables and ask for a manager and explained we still have not received drinks and were told we could not order appetizers. This is the same waitress that came to apologize for Kierra early. She confirmed our drink orders that we gave the hostess got them to our table and put in our appetizers. She also got the manager who did NOTHING except say we will get 2 waiters to make up which did not happen. I failed to get his name but it doesn't matter because we will not be back. Alexis my message to you is to go to a restaurant where they will appreciate your hard work. Try Grotto they were excellent. Alexis you did excellent and because of you we will possibly visit a different BJ's. Keep up the good work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=60

We barley ever see our servers and everything takes so long to get delivered to our table. The soft drinks are never carbonated and are always flat and sweaty. On several occasions, the food has taken an hour plus to make. Managers all always at people's tables cleaning up employees mistakes and apologizing. It takes about 20-30 minutes for appetizers to come out, followed shortly with the main course. I will say the pizookie is the reason I keep coming back, it is wonderful. But it takes about half an hour to get to our table too. It is really sad because I love the food, but the service is always awful. It doesn't matter if it's a week night or weekend, busy or not, it is awful every time. Also, there is always a wait when there are several open tables, and when I went on a date one night, we were seated in a circular booth for 6.

They have over 50 handcrafted beers to choose from as well as a full bar.  I'm a vodka kind of gal and they serve up a nice strong Cosmo!  I keep wanting to try new things, but my favorite starter is the fried artichoke hearts with lemon aioli.  So addictive!  This time I added a mozzarella and tomato salad.  It was fresh tasting and beautifully presented, but the cherry tomatoes lacked flavor.  Some nice heirloom tomatoes would have really completed the dish. Their pizzas look fantastic, but again being the creature of habit that I am, I have a heard time straying away from my favorite dish. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken is my jam. Marinated chicken breasts coated with Parmesan cheese and crunchy Panko bread crumbs and fried golden brown. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and topped with a lemon Chardonnay butter sauce. Yum!  It is a healthy sized portion and can be shared with two people, unless of course I'm one of those two people.

If we say it isn't cooked.  The pieces on out plates are not cooked either.  Why would you only tKe back the part in the pan and just have the cooks just throw it in the oven to cook more and not ask us for the uncooked pieces on our plates also or just make a new one.  Or even call the manager to see us.  And charge us for everything knowing we were not satisfied.   It's very disheartening to me to see so many uncaring restaurants now who do not care about the customer.  Just there money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=100

Sabeena C.,"Spring, TX",0,3,,2.0,7/29/2015,"Service was terrible from the start. I am not usually a critical customer, I know being a waiter is not an easy job, but we were completely neglected as if our business was a burden to our waiter.  My mom and I came in for lunch and were seated and given menus. No one came by to get our drink or food order, so we eventually asked a waiter from another table if they could get our waiter for us. The gentleman was nice enough to take our drink and food order and pass that along to our waiter, Robert (although we still had no idea who he was). Later, a female waitress brought out our appetizers without bringing us plates. She walked away so quickly, before we even had a chance to ask for some. Our waiter, Robert, still had not come to our table, so we ended up asking another waiter to bring us plates. After we finished our appetizers, we stacked all of the plates on top of each other, as they usually give you a fresh plate for your entrée. However, when Robert finally came to the table with our pizza, he said, ""Oh did you want a new plate?"". Yes, of course I do, mine is now dirty and stacked between other dirty plates. I also ordered ranch with my pizza, but had to ask for it a second time before they brought it out. That's not a big deal, I was not upset by that. What did upset me is that they did not refill our drinks once during the entire meal. Our glasses were nearly empty before the food came out, and they never once came to check on us unless we called them first. I have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant, and although we don't believe Robert deserved a tip, we gave him 15% anyway.

The turkey patties are processed and pre-formed.  The beer is not made in the establishment making the window that shows the distillery as decieving.  The stringy fries were so greasy I could have just asked for an order of lukewarm grease that gave the flavor and aroma of fries.  The avocado dip is extremely spicy, and please note they don't warn you.  According to my wife the ground beef patties were tasteless and very dry.  Additionaly, they are not careful to pay particular attention to food allergies.  For example, no cheese on a burger and gluten free bun.  I had to send my order back 3 times and waited almost 35 minutes for the meal I ordered in the first place.  Truthfully, this establishment gives the ambiance of gourmet food and specialty beer but it's all marketing.  Moreover, the manager had the audacity to charge me regular price while confidenty stating we did give you what you ordered.  I would strongly advise against spending your hard earned money at this establishment.  Find a place with good quality food and management that loves their job, and it shows!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=100

I'm not normally mean about that but it was so bad, it's the first thing I noticed when I walked in.  My advice, please address the importance of hygiene to staff since they work around food,  and most importantly - properly train your staff.  They should know the menu enough to answer a few simple questions.  They should also check on their tables enough to know they'd like ketchup and should know what drinks their tables are drinking so they don't dump unsweetened tea in their sweet tea or water in their Sprite.  Pretty disappointed in this place considering lunch for 2 was 50$",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=100

Do you have any houston beers? ""We have a St. Arnolds."" (one selection). There are many, many places to get great local craft beers in Houston. This is not one of them.

Jared P.,"Chicago, IL",146,314,23,2.0,1/14/2012,"We went to this place because it had a pretty decent review. When we got there, the place was packed and I was thinking ""oh boy, with this many people, it can't be bad!"" Then, they told us we had to wait 20 minutes, which was reasonable for a place this packed. Twenty minutes later, they sat us down and I ordered a beer. They have a bunch of signature beers and I tried an ale. It was good, but I'm not sure if the beer is actually brewed on sight. Many of the brewhouses that I visited back in PA actually have the equipment showing to make it evident that they were brewing on site. If they aren't brewing on site, what makes this beer so special? If they are, let's see the brewing atmosphere! Anyways, all the hype was on this deep dish pizza they serve. I had been craving pizza for weeks and almost resorted to Cici's pizza the weekend before. We got the 5 Meat Large Deep Dish. Now, I'm from the north, so pizza is heavily critiqued, especially in Pittsburgh. First of all, the pizza was kind of cold. No, it wasn't freezing cold, but I expect my pizza to be scald-the-roof-of-your-mouth when it first comes out. This was far from that. Secondly, they used so much oil that it was making my girlfriend sick. She was literally wringing the oil out of the crust after she picked the toppings off. I've eaten pizza with pools of grease on the top, but this was was a little absurd. Was it horrible? Nah. But, it's definitely not worth the price nor the wait when you can get the same thing at the Pizza Hut down the street for a lot cheaper and probably delivered to your door hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=100

So once again I reiterated my desire that we want to look at the menu so give us a few minutes ok? I ordered the top shelf margarita and it came out so sour it was tasting like those sour candies my kids used to get. Once again enter the waiter who offered to fix the problem. I told him I make these at home and if it had any Grand Marnier as advertised it would have a darker color. He brought it back and just as bad so I said take that away. Now we asked for chips and salsa. The chips were soft and greasey and many broken pieces and the salsa was like eating tomatoe sauce with water added. I think you could get a better flavor if you went to Walmart or the dollar store and bought the cheapest carp you can find. Ok fast forward ordered a pizza and once again full of tomatoes.

Steph L.,"Spring, TX",2,19,7,2.0,12/19/2014,"Normally, my boyfriend and I really enjoy BJs. We dine there every couple of weeks and have amazing service. Tonight was another story. The hostess was absolutely miserable, barely even acknowledging us. She then said another girl would seat us, but the second girl was walking away already without knowing she was the one to do the job. Grumpy hostess sat us, not without a huff and puff about it though. Once sat, we met our server; She was so nice! I was thrilled the first impression was off. We ordered almost immediately. After a short time our food came out. My order was wrong; at this point I didn't really mind because I wasn't starving. My boyfriend was pretty upset because he hates eating without me, but I reassured him it was fine and not to worry because I wasn't angry. Then when it came out, boyfriend was finished with his food, and the meal was still wrong (thankfully just in the portioning; I asked for the single portion not double of the pork chops). The waitress blamed it on the kitchen ""hardly being able to understand english"". We then ordered a pizookie (whoever created this dessert is a god), and got the bill. Not only were we not offered the meal on them, or a discounted dessert; but they charged me for the larger sized pork dish!!! Once I brought it up to the waitress her entire attitude changed. She acted like we were an inconvenience to her. And when she finally dropped the corrected check she said in a very irritated tone (as she's walking away, not even looking at us) ""merry christmas"". This ones on you kiddo, if you had had and ounce of empathy you may have gotten a tip. For the first time in over 10 years I walked out of a place without leaving a server anything.

It's hard enough to find a decent pizza in Houston and BJ's was a restaurant we could count on. That was until they made changes to the way they served the pizzas. Now you get a rather bland and barely warm pizza.  When we complained to our waitress she explained how ""corporate"" has made them change and a lot of customers have been complaining about it.  We then chatted with the manager. He wasn't really concerned about our opinion and stated something similar to what the waitress had said.  Hmm, if they have a lot of complaints and continue down the same path, doesn't that bespeak of just plain stupidity? Or perhaps they are trying to disprove the definition of insanity.

I tried their watermelon salad, (listed under the small plate selection) really delish, it had arugula, greens, chunks of watermelon, pecans, red onions, feta cheese, yum and only $2.95! Perfect starter followed by my veggie/goat cheese flat bread, really delish too.  The portions here are pretty large, you can split a dish or not,. :) They have great beer selection and their special brew of handcrafted beers they make in house.

Not necessarily negative, but weird start. I think our server was ready to head out the door as we were her last table so not exactly bubbly happy service. Being asked about dessert and having the check dropped when I have more than half of my entree left is not exactly the most ""please stay and enjoy your meal"" notion.  Outside of that, the food was great! I had the Cherry Glazed Salmon (possible correction on exact entree name) and it was perfect. Perfectly flakey salmon, the glaze was sweet but not too much, the couscous had a spice that I loved, the whole thing just worked. My boyfriend enjoyed the Chicken Pita Tacos as well.

About another 10 minutes goes by, and the entire table was done eating minus the one person waiting for the sandwich. When it comes out, its 3 measly pieces of chicken.. not even a single chicken breast. There is NO WAY it took 20 mins to cook 3 small thin pieces of chicken. The server clearly saw how long it took and how bad the timing was. No manager came by, no offer to take it off the bill.  I have been in the service industry for about 10 years now.

When my son invited me there I agreed only because the previous experience was good.

So what they gave me was a piece of overcooked, dried out salmon with some boiled shrimp with some canned tomatoes. I sent it back and a few minutes later the manager came over and offered to make it over. Why did they serve me the returned entree to begin with? He didn't know. What will be different this time-if you can't make it right t second time, why not the first time? Asked if I wanted something else - I declined. He said he was sorry and to let him know if I wanted to order something else  and left. Not the first time they just decide to send whatever out of the kitchen and hope you just accept it.

Ok so I read that in an article by the Chronicle. But never the less it makes me feel better about drinking the beer here. So now that is out of the way lets talk about the place. Their menu is very extensive and I usually stear away from meals like glazed chicken or pork chops because I can make that stuff better at home. I pretty much only eat pizza at this place...the Mediterranean to be specific. The crust is chicago style, soft and crunchy. One of the better pies I have had in the Houston area. I have had a turkey sandwich and a side salad or two, they are fairly run of the mill. I think what I really like about this place is that it reminds me of my favorite restaurant from my home town. New, clean, friendly people relaxing and drinking beer.

Lindsay S.,"Chicago, IL",73,545,21,2.0,3/7/2011,"It's a Friday's atmosphere that acts like they brew beer on property.  It's a chain folks. But my country parents love this place and couldn't wait to bring me here.  So in we stopped on the way home from the airport.  It's huge and is trying to be a sports bar.  I think.  I think BJ's is confused.  (sidenote: why anyone wants to call any business BJ is beyond me) The menu was huge but typical fare.  Nothing original.  Trying to keep it healthier than the norm I opted for the 1/2 turkey sandwich with a salad.  The waitress then asked me what kind of fries I wanted with that.  Seriously?  More food than that?  Gross.  I should have asked for the dressing on the side because my vinaigrette was poured on top of the iceberg lettuce concoction.  The wait staff was nothing special.  The beer was okay (I had the Red Jeremiah (?) one they were toting for St Patrick's Day).   All-in-all, if it were my choice, no thank you.  This is typical Woodlands crap.  A chain restaurant, made to be huge and look fancy.  Thrown into the abysmal Porto Fino shopping center.  Makes me remember why I left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=140

Note that - you can't get happy hour prices unless you're at the bar!  Which is frustrating and bad business, especially considering they don't tell you that unless you ask or they happen to mention it. But, if you do get a seat at the bar (it can get crowded in the evenings) during happy hour you can get a good deal on a 'mini pizza' (half price) and choose a brew from their tap wall; they have a pretty good selection.  I'd estimate 20 or so and not just macros.  Sadly, I wasn't impressed with their 'house' beers (they don't brew on site anyhow) but their cider (although expensive) is pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=140

Stephen C.,"Conroe, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/17/2011,"This place. For some reason, i've been here 3 times and all 3 times were crap. After today, i've now learned my lesson. I'd love to sit in on a training class to understand why the service sucks so bad. Where do they hire these people from? I guess you don't need experience to work at BJs. I used to be a server, i know how it works. The first time i ate here was when it first opened so i can let the 2 hour lunch slide. I work on the other side of the freeway so a 2 hour lunch is ridiculous The second time, i was with 3 other people and for some reason, my order never came out. So instead of fessing up to forgetting it, the server (i think his name was Gary) cracked jokes the whole time and offered me breadsticks. I'm sure BJ's breadsticks are a popular item. I never once saw a manager, i just sat there watching my coworkers eat until my crappy sandwich arrived.. It was no big deal to the server and i was offered no discount.  Then today i decided foolishly to return to BJs. Me and my coworker ordered avocado eggrolls and a California cheeseburger to split. The eggrolls come out with a chicken sandwich. He told me the burger would be medium-well, how did he ring up a chicken sandwich instead? And once again, it was no big deal to him. All i got was a bare apology and a promise that my burger would be ""out soon"". Yeah, i've heard that one before. Once again, not a manager to be seen. When i forgot an order, which was rare, i would tell the customer and then tell the manager. That would at least salvage a tip. That's one good thing about BJs, you won't have to tip much. And do they not hire female servers? All i see are balding dudes with no personalities.  The food tastes half-microwaved most of the time, even their overrated pizzas. It's your typical American chain restaurant  but they're trying to market themselves as something more. It's not, revolving door and all. And the beer? I know my beers, i've been to Dark Lord Day (look it up). I've probably been to 25 different breweries in the last year. I have yet to enjoy one of BJ's beers. They're too sweet and the flavor is always off. I'd rather brew my own. I normally keep my complaints to myself and i don't write reviews but i've had enough of this place. Fool me once, blah blah blah.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=140
Dan I.,"Spring, TX",0,5,,3.0,5/26/2013,"Decided to try out BJ's as it had been repeatedly recommended by friends as a decent place for late-night dining.  Since our kids were on their ""holiday: sleeping schedule, we were all ready to go and hungry upon arrival @9pm.  The Scene: Carrying a 2 yr-old, asked for child seat.  We have waitstaff already asking for our drink order while we've literally not finished getting seated and I've still got the toddler in my arms. Oh well, maybe I'm overreacting. Nope, the waiter returns in 60 seconds to take our food orders and asks (sarcastically) if we had any questions about their 130+ items on the menu. I asked for 2-3 minutes to look over the menu. Evidently I've now offended them as he doesn't return for more than 10 minutes.  I order chips & salsa (appetizer) as well as our meals.  The chips take around 15 minutes to come out. I'm wondering if they had to gring the corn in back when I see the issue. Their idea of chips & salsa is that is must appear fru-fru.  Three different colors of chips, and beneath the patina of full-size chips on the top are what I'll simply call ""chip crumbles"". As the wife, the kids & I were all starving at this point (I've already downed two excellent root beers), we stuff what we can into our mouths before our meals come out. The salsa is very mild, yet spicy.  While I was shocked at $6 for Chips & Salsa, it was somewhat redeemed by the quality. The meals arrive and wife loves her Jambalaya. I start eating my open-faced chili burger (sans the cheese) and notice the Northern affectation of beans in the chili. The full 8 oz. patty along with the chili is very filling.  The kids enjoy an excellent Grilled Cheese and generic chicken fingers. The fries: They come in two options.  Thin and wedge-cut.  Hoping little fingers would be better off with the thin variety, I got those for the kids and reserver teh wedge-cut for myself. I shold have stuck with the thin, though none were very inspiring. ""Seasoned"" fries?  Not really.  Ore Ida frozen seasoned fries were a step above my wedge-cut ones. The Good: Some of the food was excellent - The Salsa, Wife's Jamabalaya, my chili burger, daughter's Grilled Cheese, the root beer was great. Quick seating, initially attentive waitstaff. Place is beautiful inside. Accessible at times ""normal"" restaurants won't be open.  HUGE menu.  Good-sized portions. Teh dessert we had no room for looked wonderful. The Bad: Fries were worse than Red Robins, and now hold 1st place in my bland hall-of-fame. Aggressive waitstaff combined with ""team delivery"" combined for some crossed messages. Too long to get food, beter bring a snack for very young kids before the food arrives. Bring three plates with fries, but no ketchup? Trying to get said ketchup took 10 minutes with me doing everything but sending up a flare. Got kids?  Hope you don't like the TV, you won't be anywhere near one. You have been segregated to the kid zone at the front. I love having the check early, but mid-meal might be off-putting to some.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=140

Ryan H.,"Noblesville, IN",47,117,14,3.0,11/7/2012,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse has locations in fifteen different states with the majority being in California and Texas, and I visited one in The Woodlands/Shenandoah just north of Houston, Texas.  They have some televisions and a bar but still offer a pretty nice sit-down restaurant atmosphere.  They serve a very large menu that starts out with a good selection of their house beers.  Since I visited BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse during lunch time, I tried their handcrafted root beer which was good, although I do wish that I sampled one of their alcoholic beers.    BJ's is known for their deep dish pizzas and just recently started serving hand-tossed pizzas. I think my favorite thing about both pizzas is their crust.  The deep dish had a nice soft crust that was similar to a very thick pan pizza's as opposed to traditional deep dish pizzas where the outer edges of the crust are pretty hard.  Additionally, the hand-tossed pizza's crust was thin but still slightly airy making the edges more soft than crispy.  Furthermore, the toppings were pretty good on both pizzas, but I would recommend their deep dish slightly above their hand-tossed pizza.  The nice thing is that they serve their deep dish in many different sizes, and you can go with as small as the mini that I had to ensure you don't get too stuffed.  Even if you aren't looking for pizza, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse's menu likely has something for you, and I would encourage you to visit the Shenandoah location as their staff was very friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-shenandoah?start=160

Ron B.,"Spring, TX",0,38,,4.0,2/14/2014,"We went to BJs Restaurant and Brewhouse in Shenandoah tonight to get the free birthday pizookie desert. Had to wait for a table because they are always crowded. Always loved the food here and the service has always been great. Were seated in a timely manner and ordered the Triple Chocolate Pizookie along with two Irish Cream Coffee's. Irish Coffee's came out pretty quick..but..they did not look right. We previously had Irish Coffee's in a number of restaurants in Galveston where we spent four days enjoying the sites. This did not look anything like what we have been drinking. Tasted it, was okay but no Baily's Irish Cream. Drink looked black like dark coffee, but you could smell the whiskey. Inquired with the waiter about the drinks. He stated that the original Irish Coffee was served with Jameson Whiskey in coffee and no Bailey's. (when we arrived home, I checked on the internet under 'the origin of Irish Coffee' and found at:   that back in 1952 a couple of guys perfected the Irish Coffee that was served in Ireland at the Airport and they nailed it. It does have a Cream poured on top of the coffee that would float.) ...and the majority of the Irish Cream Coffee's served always use Bailey's Irish Cream in the Coffee, and this is what we are used too. They charge $7.75 for their Irish Coffee, which is kind of high for what you get. So, BJ's would be wrong. The employees there are only following the orders passed down from management on what is in their Irish Cream Coffee...which is what we ordered.  The Triple Chocolate Pizookie was EXCELLENT as it always is. Thank you BJ's for the free desert but C'mon-Man, get with it on the Irish Cream Coffee. The waitress and waiter were terrific and understood what we really wanted. By the way...BJ's has an Artichoke/Spinach Pizza that is the best ANYWHERE. If you have not tried this, do so.
