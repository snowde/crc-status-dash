Nate H.,"Mandeville, LA",235,208,394,4.0,11/8/2017,"Had dinner tonight at BJ's. Good food! Nice place. Very clean and well kept. Long bar with tons of different beers on tap. Lots of TVs. I had a 6"" mini deep dish pizza. It was an all meat pizza. $11.95!! Yes, $11.95 for a little personal pan pizza. I could have eaten two of them. My sister ordered the pulled pork sandwich that came with fries and slaw. She gave me half of her sandwich since I had little food compared to what she was served. The BBQ sandwiches are BIG and really good, although a bit messy. Our waitress was super friendly and checked on us often. I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell
Zoe D.,"New Orleans, LA",192,15,21,5.0,10/8/2017,"This is a great pub! Stopped here to grab a good quick bite. I have to admit, it was a perfect stop. I ordered the tortilla soup as an appetizer and the lettuce wraps as a meal. The soup was perfect and the lettuce wraps were on point! Lettuce was crisp and the soup was just the right temperature to eat. Had a packed house, but I didn't have to wait. The waitress was phenomenal with suggestions! I can't wait to come back.  Came back a couple of times and this time we tried a pizza! Monday's are the best to get the pizza half priced. I even ordered one to go for the family at home. The pizza was scrumptious and hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell
Barry E.,"Brandon, MS",52,95,35,3.0,8/26/2017,The food is good but nothing special and really lacking for the price. The service both visits I have been has been lacking. It was not because they were busy either time  because we got here around 11:15 once and 4:30 the time before. Drink refills were hard to come by both times.  The beer selection is good and they carry a large selection.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell
Cherie B.,"New Orleans, LA",52,46,55,3.0,12/17/2017,The service was great.  We started with the avocado egg rolls which were fantastic.  After waiting a little while longer than expected our waitress said the kitchen only fired half of our ticket. She brought out the one entree which you could tell it was sitting under the heat lamp. Then the second came out within 10 min. For being a chain restaurant it's full of great things on the menu and reasonably priced. They did give us 2 desserts on the house the Hot Brownie topped with Ice cream. And that was delicious,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell
DJ R.,"Bogalusa, LA",0,5,6,2.0,12/31/2017,The food was decent... after they had to redo it for my wife after I had already finished my meal. Then they thought I was going to pay for full service..... not will not come back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell
DeMarius J.,"Havelock, NC",100,1,1,2.0,11/10/2017,"I've tried to give this restaurant another fair chance...but unfortunately i won't be returning. The service has been more than questionable on both occasions. Their electronic system of placing orders has not EVER worked which results in the waiters/waitresses either trying to memorize my order (and get it wrong) or right on a napkin (and still get it wrong somehow). Not all of the food is bad...however as you can tell from the photo my asparagus came out dry and wilted. Additionally, we never got the appetizer we order. The staff was nice enough to recook our order...but let's be honest...ain't nobody got time for that!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell

She needs to be written up or fired. Sooo uncalled for. The next table from us felt the same way. It's like she had others bring out our food, but didn't refill our drinks, when we got another waitress attention, that waitress waited on us immediately. When it came down to the check, Tourean,C was no where to be found. Unprofessional. Things like that is when you lose customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell

Belinda R.,"Waveland, MS",121,1,,2.0,11/12/2017,"The only reason I'm leaving 2 stars is because management was very polite and kind about the whole thing. If it was just one mistake it would have been fine. But first I asked for extra green beans, she told them I wanted no green beans. I asked twice. They charged us double for our drinks. The burgers were burnt when we asked for medium. And the vegetables and burgers tasted like the grill caught on fire and smoke covered the food. It was really disappointing because I wanted to take my mother and husband out to their favorite place for veterans day.

Erika J.,"Slidell, LA",8,51,40,2.0,10/15/2017,"I ate at this location two times but never going to again. This just proves for me that I just cant stand most chain restaurants anymore. At this particular location, the soup is never hot. Their clam chowder soup is just canned soup. Their bbq sauce they use for their pulled pork sandwich is so simple and bland, the bottom bun was soggy, they overstuffed it, and they wanna charge you almost $15 for that. It IS a chain restaurant so I shouldn't be surprised but there are so many other complaints (lol). Especially with their basic salads like with their chicken tender salad (whatever they wanna call that) the lettuce is majorly chopped up in bits and they only put 3 or 4 chicken tenders on it and wanna charge you $15 for it.... why??? I would rather spend $15 at Taco Hell. Never going to this chain restaurant again. The staff is nice and everything but the food is nothing special. Glad I'm not the sucker that wants to waste almost $30 on a piece of meat that isn't even fresh either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell

Lindsey R.,"League City, TX",0,28,3,4.0,8/31/2017,"Food was good overall. I tried the kale and Brussels sprouts (sounds weird. It tastes great) it was very fresh and it had cranberries, grapes, and blueberries that were all in good shape and not old/withered. Too much dressing on it for me - my fault for forgetting to ask for it separately. Husbands fries were a bit too greasy but sandwich was good. Waitress was very efficient. I think her smile must hurt to use because I never saw it, she was friendly though. Order they brought out at first was wrong and I couldn't consume due to allergies, she noticed right away when she came to check on us and quickly got it fixed and no complaining from either end so that went well. Would recommend this place. I'll just have to remember to order dressing on the side next time :).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell

Russell P.,"Watson, LA",0,3,2,1.0,9/21/2017,"Normally love BJ's but walked out of this one. I seated at the bar area and had no one approach me till I asked the server if anyone was working the area. The one she identified had passed by me no less than 3 times. She appeared to be more interested in her co-worker. At one point she was just chatting to him 2 tables away. Only after I stood up to ask bartender did she walk over to offer to help. I told her if she's the waitress I want nothing in the place. She then lied about just coming in. Well, I admit it's a white lie since her and her friend and just walked back in. Disappointed to the bartender could of flagged her a number of times to raise her awareness. My problem is resolved. Came into longhorn with twice the amount of people and the bartender got my drink order within 1-2 minutes. Nikita rocks.

One waitress literally stood there and chewed her nails right near us while we stared her down waiting to see if she would help us. She didn't. Turned around and went and hung out in the kitchen. Finally, a staff member walked by and asked if we were being helped yet. I replied no. Then she went to the kitchen to apparently tell the host that we were there to pick up food. She came out the kitchen looking stoned and talking a bit of jibberish I couldn't make out! The service just from ordering take out was horrible.

Steven F.,"Slidell, LA",42,62,203,4.0,11/11/2015,"There's a few not so good post for this restaurant. The only thing I can say is, you need to try this restaurant and formulate your own experience. There's way too many good choices on the food menu and beer menu to not give them a try. This was my 2nd visit and 1st official visit. The first time I came here was an introduction night to get the waiters and waitresses some hands on training. The initial visit was great, I wrote about it but it was before the business was on yelp, so I'm not sure what happened to my review. This visit was equally great except I had access to their full menu which made me excited. This visit we came to the establishment on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The location was hopping but not too busy. I came with my wife and 3 yr old. We ordered 2 appetizers, the calamari was delicious and the spring rolls was equally delicious. I apologize for this being the end of this review. I forgot to finish this review and was reminded of it on my next visit.

Robert V.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",37,65,28,1.0,6/13/2015,"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had! I'm guessing this place is new and haven't yet had their grand opening, because they have some major problems. I travel quite a bit and have been to many BJs locations across the country, never has my service been this bad. When we arrived we were told we would be seated right-away, they just had to clean a table meanwhile 15 min later we realize that there was a hostess shift change and they failed to communicate the table was for us gave it to another party that arrived after us. So 30 min. later we got a table. Then it continues with the deaf waitress (I'm only assuming because we had to repeat our order twice) seemed very unfamiliar with the menu and confused by our requests (no substitutions requested BTW). Then the kitchen is running behind and it took them another 40 min to get our food. When the food came my ""well-done"" burger came it"" medium"". Finally as we are preparing to leave they can't run my credit card because the idiot manager decided to update the computers in the middle of dinner shift. I had to sit and wait an additional 20 min. they didn't offer me anything for my inconvenience, the manager never came by to check on me, nor was he available when I asked to speak with him.

It has a big menu, and can be overwhelming. We have never really had anything bad, most dishes are above average, especially the burgers. Then one night, I ordered the club sandwich and everything changed and now I'm writing a yelp review. So my advice? Don't get distracted. Get the club sandwich. Then, if you are not satisfied, go ahead and get the brisket bacon burger. Its got brisket AND bacon.

It was, although, a bit strange to see our entrees come out before our appetizers.  Overall, the main reason I'm giving this restaurant only two stars is because of one thing-satisfaction when it comes to food. With almost everyone on our table not being able to finish our food... it was just too bland-literally everything we had ordered there. Even the ahi poke dish was a disappointment with it's portion size. The pizzas, both that we ordered-tasted like it had no tomato/marinara sauce underneath the cheesy texture. The pasta was downright bland and had no flavor, possibly needed more seasoning. The clam chowder in the bread bowl? Nope. When it came out the bread seemed cold and every part of it was soggy. If it had just came out of the oven to be set out to eat, it's reasonable to say at least some parts of the bread would not come out soggy... it literally tasted like the entire bread bowl was soaked in water for an hour.  As much as my family from Texas enjoy BJ's, living in New Orlean's-this restaurant did not give us the satisfactory justice our city is known for... Seasoning and flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell?start=20
Krystine S.,"Slidell, LA",133,227,238,2.0,4/12/2015,"This is my first try of the place ever. I've never ate at a BJs before. But I heard all the raves and was really hyped to try it.   They take reservations, and being new we called ahead! Got seated at the table and waited (no exaggeration here) 12 minutes for a server to even come get our drink order. When asking what alcoholic drink she suggests she is very short and leaves after suggesting two and goes to another table. Disappointing.  Ordered bar drinks & appetizers. (The pizza dip) worst appetizer I ever had. Tasted like the cheese was old. So we switched to cheese sticks, but mind you after ordering appetizers we waited 25 minutes and ordered our food. We did not, I repeat, DID NOT even get our appetizer until after we were done with our food.  So not only did it take forever to get drinks, and our server was super short with us, and our appetizer didn't come out until after our main courses, my pizza was cold because when bringing our meal the lady didn't have a pizza stand to put it on so she stood by the table with the pizza for literally 5 minutes until she could find our waitress and wave her down to signal her for a pizza stand.  It was not a very good experience. I won't be back until they work out the kinks with their kitchen and staff. I'll try it again in 6 months and re-review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell?start=20

Jimmy T.,"New Orleans, LA",566,92,163,4.0,3/22/2015,"BJ's isn't too bad, coming here, my first impression was that I'd receive a menu filled with steaks and rib-eyes, but that's definitely not the case. I went for the Mediterranean wrap, which wasn't too bad. It wasn't really a large portion of food, but it was something that could fill you up for a few hours at the most. The server was really attentive in making sure that our drinks were constantly filled, and the highlight of the evening had to be the famous pizookie. If you're coming here with a large number of people, your best bet is to get the pizookie trio that way there's more choices in what flavors you get to try. Being on break from college for a bit, a majority of our friends decided to catch up, and this is the place we went.  The trio came out to around $9.95, and sharing it wasn't too big of a problem.

Johnnie G.,"Pearl River, LA",1,5,1,3.0,1/1/2017,"Have been there several times.  I enjoy the food, when it is correct, which isn't as often as it should be.  Appetizers are supposed to quick so that you can start eating right away, but on most occasions the appetitizers took 20 minutes or more and on more than once the appetitizer came after the meal.  If it takes that long to prepare an appetitizer they should reduce the available selection and get it right. The last couple of times at lest one in our party didn't get what they ordered.  They are apologetic and make restitution, but it has happened too frequently.

Elizabeth B.,"Logan, WV",1,8,16,2.0,7/15/2015,"The boys were excited to go here (as they are with any place that makes their own root beer); they have this place in Clearwater and Pinellas Park, Florida, so I was familiar with it. Saw three open booths and hoped we would get one, but was told they were reserved and for parties larger than our three and a child. I call BS to that because there was a couple with a small child in one of the booths, but I bit my tongue. So no booth. At least we were seated at a larger table I suppose. Our server..I'm not sure if she had never served before or if she was just on the flaky side..but I had to just laugh to myself or I was just going to get upset. We had to ask her to bring us silverware and then she only brought one set. We had to ask for drink refills...also (which I know is not the server's fault) they were out of frosted mugs for the root beer, and the cups that were used were hot which put a damper on the boys excitement. The timing of the food wasn't very good either..we got some sort of large sampler platter and we had barely started eating it and our entrees arrived. So my burger and fries were cold by the time I got to them. I had the watermelon and feta salad and it was fantastic. Nice and light and the mint was a lovely balance. I would definitely get that again. Maybe the black and blue burger would have been better if I had eaten it when it was fresh? When I got to it, the thing was a grease ball and not so good. My 4 year old enjoyed the cheese sticks from the sampler..I was told the pizza was good. I was less than impressed with the whole experience, and I know the meal wasn't cheap.

Kristy P.,"San Diego, CA",119,6,2,4.0,3/9/2015,"Brand new restaurant. There were tons of items on the menu. I ordered a Kale & Brussel Sprouts Salad. This salad includes blueberries, grapes, pepitas, cranberries, goat cheese crumbles, onions, cucumber and candied pecans. I ordered the salad with grilled shrimp on top, no pecans or cucumber, with balsamic vinaigrette. When the salad came out, it was missing pepitas, cranberries, goat cheese, onions AND the grilled shrimp. Plus, a different dressing was poured on top. Not to mention, my son's potatoes weren't sent out and our silverware was dirty. This was all very frustrating and I could tell I was about to get bitchy. HOWEVER, our server (Aaron C.), was a complete professional. He was personable and kind and actually took time to squat down next to the table to be eye to eye. He explained that the person making salads was brand new and didn't have the information needed to include the exact ingredients.  He ran around and retrieved everything that was missing. Once I had all the ingredients to my salad, it was BY FAR the BEST salad I've ever had. I will most definitely be back. Hopefully, the new restaurant kinks will be worked out soon.

David L.,"Astoria, OR",87,39,2,2.0,5/15/2015,"Giving it two stars because it's normally great. Our most recent visit was atrocious. We got in fine, sat down at our table and ordered our drinks. I asked the waitress if I could sample a couple of beers and she said that would be fine, and we ordered our pizza and salad. About ten minutes later she arrived with two half size glasses of the beer I wanted to SAMPLE, along with a water for my wife and I. After a few minutes of talking with my wife about the size of the samples (which I did not consume), I flagged down the waitress and asked her how much they were. She informed me that they were  $4.25 per sample! I've had free samples of the beer at this facility before, and they came in large shot glass size glasses. I then flagged her down again to tell her that I didn't want to pay for those because I just wanted to SAMPLE the beer. A good waitress would have recognized her error and offered them for free, but this waitress simply took them back and poured them out. Approximately 45 minutes after we ordered our food (we noticed the time due to the text that we received before to be seated), we received our salad, and 15 minutes after that, we finally received our pizza. After we finished our pizza, she came by and offered us our first refill of water. An hour later the waitress offered us our first refill... This may have been the most frustrating thing. We noticed other waiters and waitresses servicing their tables much better and faster. It was a very frustrating experience as we were both very hungry when we arrived, and it took them an hour to get our food and first refill of water.

He was conspicuous, prominent, and engaged.  We were very pleased with the service. Our waitress was fun, interactive, and well-informed about our expansive menu choices.  The food had a lot of flavor, even the mozzarella cheese sticks were very tasty.    The only drawback was that the hostess attempted to place us (two adults) next to a table filled with children.   When will restaurant hostesses ever figure this out?  Adults with no children do not want to sit next to other adults with children.  We opted for the bar, but in Louisiana, there's no guarantee you won't find children in a bar.   Although there are mixed reviews, 50-50 favorable and unfavorable, I think our experience goes to show that when there is a manager engaged in the daily activity, you will see substantially better service and a better quality of the final food product.  I would recommend this place and suggest that you go and check it out  before letting a few bad experiences stop you from enjoying what might be a nice treat. Ask for Nicole.   And,unless you already know what you want, don't go rushed.  The menu is quite large; it took us ten minutes to comb through everything.  P.S.  Lots of vegetarian choices too!  Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell?start=40

Buz B.,"Slidell, LA",17,128,22,2.0,8/3/2015,"This is a ""brewhouse"" that serves mediocre food. That's about it, really. I was excited when this place opened up, but was quite disappointed to discover that they do not brew their beer in the store, it is shipped from California or wherever. There's just something cool about a REAL brewhouse. This isn't really a brewhouse. It's a brewhouse's restaurant 1300 miles from the actual brewery. The house beers are alright, though. I like their heffewiezen. They also have a pretty good selection of the usual. I can get regular domestic or imported tap elsewhere though, so when I come here I get their house beers. I don't like the actual restaurant itself. It is entirely OPEN. No little nooks or crannies for you to lean back against and chill out in private. The store is all open and lots of completely empty space. It lacks ambiance. It lacks style and comfort. Maybe people out west like that. A bunch of non-offensive nothingness. The openness of the building is very uninviting to people who like to sit down to a nice cozy meal and a brew. Their menu LOOKS very appealing, but I've only ever had the fish and chips here because it is rather expensive. Out of the 3 times I've had their fish and chips, I was rather disappointed every time. The first time, the fish was just right, good portions and all that, but I was very turned off about those thin boring fries. Man.... screw those fries. You'd have to grab half a dozen of those dumb fries just to get a taste of potato. I was so turned off that I even left a complaint on their website. They called back and I spoke to a manager who said he was sorry that I didn't like their skinny fries, but they ""tested well"" across the country and he hoped I can get used to them. No. I won't get used to your skinny crap fries. They suck. Serve REAL fries. The other two times I got the fish and chips, the fish came out overcooked and barely any flavor. I probably won't go back there again for that. I might try something else like their cajun lasagna, though. That looked good. Their peperonni flatbread, however, is very on point, and leads me to believe that their pizza might be rockin. Speaking of rockin, you'll be rockin and rolling and slipping and sliding on those floors when you try to walk anywhere. They keep those floors so slick, it's almost as though they don't want anyone walking anywhere but to their table when they arrive and back out the door when they leave. WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THOSE FLOORS?!? I wear two types of footwear, sandals and boots, and I SHIT YOU NOT, I COULD SLIDE ALL THE WAY TO THE BATHROOM. I swear to you, that I have done that, just to prove a point. You could have your friend literally PULL you without lifting your feet if you wanted. I don't think I'll go here very much in the future. Like I said, there is NO ambiance to this place. It's all very open and impersonal. The food I and others have had was mediocre at best. This place gets 2 stars instead of 1 ONLY because they serve their house beers that I can't get anywhere else and they're pretty good and to be honest, the service here is above average; at the bar and on the floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell?start=40

James C.,"Halifax, Canada",0,2,,1.0,3/5/2016,"Worst Service Ever - So tonight my wife and I stopped in for dinner. The host promptly greeted us and sat us stating ""our server Nicole will be taken care of us"". We sat waiting for over 10 minutes with no end in site. After waving down the host, she expressed our server will be right over. Then to our surprise, our server walked passed us without even a node and served co-workers sitting to eat. Then proceeded to our table and asked how was our night. Needless to say, we promptly left and shall never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell?start=40

Jessica M.,"Slidell, LA",123,97,61,2.0,3/13/2015,The only reason they're getting two stars is the good memories I have of the San Diego locations. This one was deplorable. We were seated and then had a 45 minute wait at the table with only water.. drinks and apps were not brought out -until we reminded them multiple times- though we ordered within 5 minutes of being seated. The managers did not even care to comp us a pizookie. I think the establishment is only going to survive on the reputation of the other locations cause one visit to this place and walking out seems logical. I'd say give them a year to work out the kinks and get rid of the weak links from management to the cooks who don't understand how to get a hot soup out of the kitchen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell?start=40
Dan T.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,10,7,5.0,5/10/2015,"On Friday May 8th we were passing through on our way to the Pearl River Eco Tour and were a little early and wanted to get something to eat. We walked up around 10:30 am and a guy outside asked if he could help us. We said we wanted to get something to eat when he informed us they did not open until 11 AM.  We told him we only had an hour before our swamp tour began. He said he was the manager and we could come in early and he would have the kitchen make us something.  Al  the staff went out if their way to get us something to eat and back on the road on time.  I grew up living in Covington, LA my first eight years and have not been back for over twenty years. I had forgotten how nice and helpful the people are down south. The food was great and the service over the top. Thanks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-slidell?start=40
