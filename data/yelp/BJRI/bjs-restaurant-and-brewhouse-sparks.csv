Matthew L.,"Reno, NV",386,24,130,4.0,11/21/2017,"The Thursday rib special is mostly why I come here!  $18.95 for a full rack of ribs, two sides, a salad, and a mini pizookie is incredible!  If that doesn't convince you how good this deal and ribs are then this next part might. My girlfriend who came with me was a vegetarian before she had these ribs. She had ordered salmon tacos while I had the rib special. She took one whiff of the ribs and was instantly craving them!  Get em! They're amazing. Make sure you call to see if they still have them available for that Thursday or you will be most disappointed upon arrival",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks
Donna B.,"Reno, NV",433,955,5365,2.0,9/29/2017,"This is where the group wanted to grab a bite. And the visit reminds me why I don't care for large chain restaurants.  Three of us walked in around 5:30 pm on a Friday for happy hour after an escape room visit. The restaurant was at least a third empty and we were asked to wait 5 minutes or do to be seated. HH is only served at the bar, I discovered after being seated in the main restaurant. I ordered sliders from the small plate appetizer pages because I wasn't in the mood to look thru the entire menu. BJ has a book of a menu that I don't care for- how can all that food be fresh?  The sliders had an up-charge for cheese and another for fries.  The sliders were tasteless and were missing the grilled onions.  I did ask for the fries to be extra crispy and came swimming in a small pool of grease, but were crispy.  Our server was fabulous, checking on us often and separating the checks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks

Krystle G.,"Sparks, NV",45,7,3,5.0,1/2/2018,We cant get enough of this place. They have sensation beer and fun drink specials. The food is always good no matter what you get and the service is great. Love sitting outside in the summer and enjoying a huge salad and a cold beer. They always have some kind of special and that makes it fun and makes you feel good about going out!  Take your family or have a girls night! Either way this place is great! I love the peanut butter pazookie with chocolate ice cream!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks
Kathie A.,"Carson City, NV",41,2,3,5.0,1/7/2018,"BJ's has always been a great go-to restaurant for my family to go to (everyone can find something on the menu). However, this time was exceptionally different. On that day of my graduation from the University of Nevada, Reno (go Wolf Pack!), I was incredibly happy to have family from Las Vegas, NV and Lancaster, CA be part of my special day. We were very thankful to BJ's for allowing us to walk in during this busy time without a reservation, considering we had a party of 14. We were seated at about 6:00 pm and from then on, our experience was beyond what we had expected. We have always had great experiences at BJ's, but this visit was exceptionally different. It exceeded our expectations, mostly due to our incredible waitress, Julie E. She was incredibly friendly, accommodating, attentive, and an overall AMAZING individual. She had patience with everyone as we ordered, asked for additional condiments during the meal, and she frequently checked-in on us - all during a very busy night. The most impressive thing was this: I asked her for a group picture and I have never seen anyone go above and beyond to make this happen. She was a fairly small girl and needed a boost to fit everyone in the frame. A co-worker of hers brought her a small stool and she made it happen! It is such a small gesture, but to customers who are sharing a meal with their loved ones, it means the world. This type of customer service and hospitality is what every restaurant needs. This employee is very special and people like her are what give customers an incredibly positive experience. Thank you, BJ's, for not only serving delicious food but also hiring exceptional employees like Julie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks

Stephanie G.,"Reno, NV",269,204,1498,3.0,3/21/2017,"What sucks so much about this three stars, is I actually really love the food here. Most the time, and the service is usually great, most the time. Last night, the hubby and I decided to stop at BJ's for some late night dinner after our enchanted Beauty and the Beast movie. After scouring the huge menu, I decided on the shrimp and asparagus penne and my hubby ordered a mini pizza. Our server mentioned that large pizzas were half off on Monday, so we went with a large. Mike's rewards card was acting up and so the waitress said a manager was coming to talk to us about it. The food came. The pizza was huge, cheesy and delicious! However, my pasta was VERY Al Dente. Too Al Dente. I know the perfect bite for a pasta, and this wasn't it. BJ's, your Penne Pasta needs to be cooked a tiny bit longer. If it's par boiled and then held, the par boil, does need to be longer.  Either way I ended up ordering the mediterranean tacos, to go.  So why the three stars? Well tonight the waitress was great and did her job perfectly, yet I feel as if the manager on duty failed. He never came to our table to discuss the loyalty card, and never came to apologize about the food mishap either, which we all know a plate sent back warrants a visit from an apologetic manager, ready with solutions to make the customer happy.  Pizookie anyone? I'm not above a bribe! Lol ok so all joking aside, it felt like he didn't care enough to come out of wherever he was, to address any situations. Finally as we were leaving, the manager appeared out of no where, still never approaching us, to say ""Have a goodnight!""  ...Well honestly manager man, it would have been better if you'd made an appearance. Said anything to us at all. You're lucky to have a wait staff whose as good and friendly as they are! Because otherwise I would have been more upset about the whole situation. I'd say BJ's is more of a, not too late, late night, ...nothing else is open and fast food doesn't sound great, option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks
Kristina K.,"Sparks, NV",73,135,154,4.0,9/19/2017,"We don't come here very often as usually the times that we are out it is really busy.  But on the few occasions we have been here the food was good, the beer was cold and the service was great. They have an app for your phone which if you plan ahead you can check the wait times, reserve a table so when you get there you don't have a crazy long wait to get seated.

Ryan W.,"Las Vegas, NV",78,56,214,4.0,8/24/2017,"BJs is my go to restaurant for Sparks when you can't decide where to eat or need a diverse menu to satisfy everyone. Every time I've been to this location the service has been prompt and friendly and this last time was no difference. No matter what day of the week I go, there always seems to be a short wait if you go between 6-7pm.  We started with the spinach artichoke dip. The chips were thin and seemed like they were made in house. The dip was ok but thankfully the chips were delicious. For dinner I got the cherry chipotle glazed salmon. I have no tolerance for spice but took the risk because I really wanted salmon. If you got this dish hoping it had some kick to it you'd be thoroughly disappointed, but thankfully the lack of spice was good news for me. It was sweet but not overpowering. Overall I was happy with the dish. And of course if you go to BJs you have to end with a pizookie. Or two. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks

Tonight I ordered quinoo chicken. It was delicious. It was served on a bed of spinach,surrounded by tomato's and mushrooms. The chicken was seasoned perfectly. The chicken was cooked in a pan and seated. I passed on having dessert because my meal was so big. Definitely will order this again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks
LaRena F.,"Sparks, NV",351,390,3165,5.0,1/19/2017,Sometimes we just need to splurge and indulge. I decided to use the delivery service Eat 24 Yelp. It was the first time doing so. SO VERY GLAD I DID. What an incredible service. I was surprised of the number of choices in restaurants I could choose from. I ordered from BJ's. I placed my order and was informed it would take 60-90 minuets. It took approximately an hour and 15 minuets. That is from the time I ordered it to all the way out in Spanish Springs. RIGHT ON!! Michelle the delivery driver was unbelievably friendly and kind. She was so kind I gave her a hug. I was surprised at how quickly my order arrived. So very pleased with the delivery service and would definitely order through them again. My son had the salmon and said it was off the hook. His rice and veggies were on point too. My parmesan chicken was good not great. The mashed potatoes were creamy and heavenly. The monkey bread was ok. I think it tastes better at the restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks
Amanda F.,"Reno, NV",116,89,164,2.0,7/20/2017,"I would be giving this a 1 star, had I not been MANY, MANY times before and had a positive experience.  This is just the first time I am reviewing this restaurant as a Yelper. Last night a large group of us met for drinks after work.  We brought an out of town visitor, knowing that BJ's has such an extensive menu, and having been pleased in previous visits, we felt like this was a good choice.  The one thing I can say is consistent is the wait.  Every time we come here we have to wait longer than we should (for the food).  Whether I've gone with 2 people, or 10, they are slow.  I have always blamed it on the fact that they are busy, but last night that was not the case.  My first thought as I walked in was about how quiet it seemed in comparison to every other time I have gone.   Drinks at the bar were fine.  I was served right away, the bar tender was of average friendliness.   They were out of many beers, so my companions didn't get their first or 2nd choice, but they found something wet and alcohol flavored, so they were good to go.  After 30 minutes at the bar we moved to a table.  It took about another 30 minutes to get water-after we had ordered appetizers 20 minutes after being seated.  I wasn't super annoyed at that point because the drinks had kicked in, we were enjoying ourselves, so whatevs.  Oh, and they were always around to take drink orders.   When we got the appetizers, they were quickly gone-we ordered brussel sprouts-which are always good and my personal fave.  We also got the avocado egg rolls, calamari, pot stickers, artichokes (fried) and ahi.  Avocado rolls were consistent and good, ahi I only received a small bite but it seemed fine.  Then another 20 minutes or so after the appetizers were gone, they took our dinner orders.  We didn't receive our food until about 7:30, and we had arrived at BJ's at 5.   3 of us ordered the ahi salad.  3 of us did not enjoy it.  Having ordered it several times before, I knew something was wrong.  Since we were with a visitor, it had taken so long to get our food, and at this point, I just wanted to go home, I didn't say anything.  I ate around it.  After completing the meal and our guest had left, I was told that others felt the same.  It just wasn't good.  Our bad for not telling anyone, but at this point, we were all tired. I don't understand why BJ's is always so slow, but I was surprised that the food was bad.  They also served us at different times.  My friends waited at least 10 minutes AFTER me to receive their jambalaya, Alfredo, and Peruvian quinoa and shrimp.  They liked it though, so at least they got full!   We were going to come here for another business lunch today, but have decided to take our business lunch somewhere else.  We can't afford to wait like we did last night, and we can't afford to serve our guest sub par food.  I am sure I will be back again due to the close proximity to my job, but I don't know that I will order the ahi again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks
Jeff G.,"Klamath Falls, OR",4,24,2,2.0,10/22/2017,"Good music. Quiet atmosphere. Food was decent, however, when we ordered the first time they did not have the stuff for our order, so we had to order again. Great start! Then when requesting garlic in my steak and mashed potatoes I was surprised to find that the cooks smothered my steak in garlic powder and completely left it out of my potatoes. Upon reminding our server, I was presented with MORE garlic powder. I told her I was more thinking fresh if they had it? (I would have taken raw or even sautéed). Finally she brings out the ""fresh, sautéed"" garlic and it was refrigerator cold. Mmm. Talk about unappetizing. Meal done. Not the best. As a matter of fact, I gave them 3 stars but now I'm gonna give them 2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks
Katie M.,"Larkspur, CA",184,9,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Seriously? Thank you BJ's for ROBBING me of 50 something dollars. I've loved going to BJ's for years and the food was always good, but will never go back after this experience. I ordered delivery, paid 15 extra dollars for the delivery service they use, and the food that arrived was complete garbage. The $13 dollar salad I ordered was 97% romaine lettuce and had barely any of the toppings that it was supposed to come with, you know..the ones I was looking forward to eating. It was also supposed to have avocado in it and they forgot the avocado. The spaghetti entree had barely any sauce and was completely tasteless. The fried artichokes were so gross I threw them out, along with the rest of the food. They clearly just don't give a shit about their delivery orders.

Joanna V.,"Las Vegas, NV",487,469,6111,4.0,11/26/2016,"We intended to hit up Grimaldi's, except that restaurant has still yet to be constructed. Alright BJ's you're getting our business... Seated within 5 minutes and greeted by Alejandra.  I like the interior of BJ's.  I like their beer selections.  Their menu has a good variety of choices.  It's a casual atmosphere.  TV's are even placed in the regular dining areas.   Let's start with their limited edition Grand Cru beer and a draft root beer.  Hmmm that looks good - avocado egg rolls!!!  Lured by appetizing pictures, decided pretty quick on what to eat: Salmon quinoa bowl - The winning dish in our lunch choices.  Enjoyed this very much; really tasty!  I can never get quinoa flavor to stick at home.  This bowl was really delish with the asparagus and red bell peppers.  Topped with a nice flaky flavorful salmon.  Nom-awesome! Seared Ahi salad - Liked it not loved it.  Made sure we ate the ahi first cuz the rest of the salad was typical like any other.  The presentation was really pretty.  But our salad had to be redone due to a hair mixed into the salad.   So how many of you say ""can't dine at BJ's without having a Pizookie""?  Mmmhmmm... nobody's judging.  I think the same way hahaha!  Look I even ordered it to take out cuz Ness had to go to work.  It was still sweetly yummified and the vanilla bean ice cream scoop didn't melt on the way back. Besides the salad hair mishap, our service during this visit was really good.  I hope the tips people leave for Alex all goes to her.  Dunno how it works there.  Thanks for taking care of our table Alex although we sorta rushed the end of our meal.

We decided last minute to go here for a late dinner & celebration because it's one of the few restaurants that is open late. The service was good in the beginning but towards the end the server never asked us if we wanted any dessert or anything else before giving us the check. He just put the check on our table and walked away. Then he came back to ask for the pizookie flavors for the ones who had it included in their special meal and then I told him that it was my birthday and he said sure, what flavor? After all of that we got the desserts but mine had no candle on it :/ I wanted my night to be special but it's whatever until my dad asked for a candle for my half eaten pizookie.

I took my daughters and their friends yesterday for appetizers and dessert as a celebration of my middle daughter's birthday. We waited for close to 10 minutes before the server came over to at all. We ordered waters and out food - mozzarella sticks and pazookies. The food came out and then half way through, we finally got our water. No one ever came back to check on us. My water glass sat empty for I don't know how long. It was finally refilled as we were trying to get our check to leave. We sat there for another 10 or 15 minutes and when I decided it may be faster to go to the hostess stand to try to pay our bill, the server came by, complained about how busy he was, and finally printed the check. The food was better than just ok and my army of pre-teen girls were having a good time, so I guess it wasn't all bad, but the service was so bad, it will probably be a long time before I go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=20

Got the seats at the bar in front of the big screen. Incredibly......NO SOUND!!! Didn't stay long enough to ask the Manger ""What the hell?"" BJ's in Vegas cranks all the games on all the house speakers! That's how you watch a marqee game! Instead they were pumping the same shitty music I've never heard of!

They have a variety of non-alcoholic drinks that are perfect for a young underage gal like me. The fries here are SO GOOD.  Can we talk about Pizookies??? A masterpiece, really.

The menu can be a bit overwhelming but you of course will find something that sounds good. Their brews are decently priced.

I have had the pleasure of eating at both Reno and Sparks location as well as the one at the Arden Fair Mall in Sacramento. So far I have found nothing on the menu that was anything less than perfect and that consistency (as well as the great customer service) is what keeps me coming back.  Why not 5-stars then? Because the menu keeps changing. It is an entirely different menu then the one I loved when they first opened their doors in Northern Nevada back in 2008 (Summit Sierra location). Some of the greatest items on that menu were cut (like the turkey club, which was perfection on a plate) and every time I go back there are a myriad of new things for their customers to try. While I am intrigued by their continual offer of new noshes, I am sad to see my favorite items leave the menu and never return. This should not keep folks from falling in love with this place though as it is one of my favorite haunts.  I'm not much of a drinker so I cannot speak to their bar's consistency.

On busy days, you can expect to wait quite a while for a table, but most days it's not so bad. The menu is large and has something for everyone. Choosing what to get is pretty hard because the amount of options presented can be overwhelming (which is a good thing).

John P.,"Reno, NV",10,60,19,3.0,4/29/2017,"First off, you will not find friendlier, more professional servers than here. Kudos to management here for training this young staff, many who seemed right out of high school to be so focused on customer satisfaction, from hosts to bar to restaurant, all were excellent. Problems: I got on the app's preferred waitlist Friday night. It was still a long wait at the bar, and they text you when your table's ready. Mine were delayed for some reason (signal?) and 45 minutes later found I lost my place in line. The hostess said they recently got rid of the vibrating disks ""and we all hate the new system."" At the bar I paid $5.95 for a draft beer in a slim, smallish glass...plus the bartender shortchanged me more than an inch from the top (dark beer no head). The Mahi Salad ($15.95) entrees we ordered came with 5 small squares of mahi with no bread, one without dressing. Sad to say we left hungry.

Geri G.,"Reno, NV",74,64,106,4.0,4/23/2017,Came here tonight with my parents. It's always good. The server was very friendly and accommodating. We got the guac and chips to start with. They definitely don't skimp on the avocados. Good flavor super fresh. We then shared a bacon cheeseburger and fish and chips. The fish was super flaky and had good flavor and the burger was huge.  Overall it was a good meal with lots of food.

My husband order the prime rib was supposed to be medium rare, when he received his prime rib it was very very rare. He was not happy with it. I ordered a full rack of baby back BBQ ribs,  they were delicious, fell right off the bone. Also had the steamed broccoli and  very good. All in all the dinner was very tasty except for the prime rib, we did bring it home because of course you're not going to spend that kind of money and leave it behind.  Our waitress was very good, she was right on spot with seeing how everything was.  She told the manager about the prime rib and they offered to cook it some more.  We did not take them up on it we just took it home and cooked it more ourselve the next day.  Im sure we will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=20

BJ's offers a variety of pizza, pasta, appetizers, burgers, and more. They offer some interesting combinations as well.  Service is great from the hostesses to the servers to the managers coming around and asking us how we are. Though it can be a little pricey they do offer a $10 off of $35 coupon which adds to be about a free appetizer!  Let's not forget the pizookies which should be a review on their own. Holy moly these are worth every calorie. I love the peanut butter one but I think it's seasonal. The monkey bread one is pretty good but let's be honest the cookie is the best part!

Put our dinner order in the wait time didn't seem that long at all one of the managers came over and apologized for the wait and said he made some adjustments to our bill and brought us extra veggies that we both love!

chris k.,"Dublin, CA",0,17,1,1.0,10/8/2017,Not a great experience whatsoever.  The biggest let down is that they would not accept several online coupons nor did the discount for downloading the mobile ap.  I can stand places that bait and switch.

Gene C.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,2,4.0,7/7/2017,"I ordered from the BJ's app and it was all submitted and the order was pending but when we got there to pickup the food they said we didn't order and we have evidence that we did.I did not nothing wrong on my part because I ordered it like how I always do and every time I order it says the same thing about my order being sent in successfully and I would always get my food at the time I scheduled the order. They are like not taking credibility for this mistake and I assure you the order was sent in successfully but they are saying we didn't order and this puts me in a position where I am questioning myself and when I question myself it leads me to be stressed over the situation. This is the first time this has ever happened to me. Note:This review is based on the customer service and not the food.The food here is good and I will never hate the food but the fact that the order was placed and they say it wasn't makes me mad and having to reorder something that was already ordered online makes this even more difficult especially because you take 5 minutes of your time to order but instead you go and that time you took goes to waste just to order it again. I also believe that they could've possibly given my food to a different person making it seem like we are stupid and making the workers think we can't order. This is my first time leaving such review on BJ's customer service that I never thought I had to do but today was that day I had to. Good Day! (I sent this review to the wrong location and so I decided to post it to the correct location.I also wrote this comment because the person said we didn't order when they could've said something between the lines of ""The computers haven't been working so this is probably why we didn't get your order."")

My wife loved her blackened salmon and I hated my Brewhouse burger the patty was in pieces at one point it had cheese but they scrapped it off, and meat had no flavor and the bread was so greasy.

Ordered the bison burger, added fresh jalapeno (what came out was pickled) and another ordered the bison burger with some specific requests (no bun, tomato and avocado only) waiter confirmed her order and suggested a lettuce bun, and she agreed nice catch.  Other 2 meals were the chicken tacos, and I believe a western burger.  Some had fries some did salads, and again kudos to the waiter asking if we want salads prior to main or with main.   Service is on point another round of beers is ordered, not a fan of light beers but was in the mood for a lager and the standard lager there pouring here drinks easy.  Meals come everything looks great except the lettuce wrap burger comes with everything on it, which is a bbq sauce and pepper relish, had to address this, waiter said no problem would get an immediate re-fire.  Manager came over apologized and let us know the ETA on the new burger is 3 min out and he would in turn be delivering it.  True to their word 3 min go by and burger comes out perfect. On other visits I've had better food or worse service but the place gets a consistent 4 stars from me, I've done drinks and bar food at the bar, bigger events here, and just normal evenings out and I just appreciate a place with consistency.  Check them out on a Tuesday great wine specials and discounts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=40

SOOOO much flavor and such a fantastic variety of flavor in one dish.  IT was so delicious that I am actually excited about going back and ordering it again.  My friends ordered the Jambalaya and the Parmesan Chicken Wings.  They seemed to both gobble those up pretty quickly too so I am taking that to mean a big thumbs up on their dinners as well.

My Ahi Salad was delicious, perfect even. It looked just like the picture and was crisp and refreshing on a hot summer day.  Friday night I decided that I would give the Ahi Salad another go since it was so delicious the time before. I was sadly disappointed. This time it looked nothing like the picture, had no wanton crisps, no wasabi and was drenched in the dressing. The last few bites were completely inedible because they had so much dressing.  The one redeeming thing about the night was our server Nicole. She was attentive and hilarious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=80

Melissa B.,"Sparks, NV",39,70,104,4.0,8/1/2016,"Stopped into BJ's on Saturday afternoon about 1pm.  Parking lot packed, but there was no wait for a party of two.  Yay.  Took waiter a few minutes to get to us, but that was fine, they were very busy and it gave us a chance to look over the menu.  I ordered an Alabama Sunset to drink and the half sandwich and small salad (California Chicken Club and Twisted BLT salad) for lunch.   Let me say, my drink was scrumptious.  I should have ordered two right away...maybe it was that delicious.  Maybe it was because it was like 98 degrees outside and I really needed a frosty beverage...not sure, don't care.  It was delicious.  Yumm.   Salad came first.  I guess I didn't read the menu, not sure, but it came with dressing already on it.  I do not like that unless it is a Cesar and I expect it.  I always want my dressing on the side.  This was some sort of heavy vinaigrette.  I gave it a chance and tried it.  Did not like it at all.  I usually like my bacon, egg, tomato type salads with a creamy dressing.  I told the waiter that I just did not want the salad as the dressing was no bueno.  He immediately offered a new one with a dressing of my choice.  So, I said Blue Cheese or Ranch, either.  He said, I will bring both and a new salad.  Came back in a few with my new salad, and I ordered another drink.  Salad with Blue Cheese was delicious. Spinach salads, I like, especially with bacon.  Sandwich was up a few minutes later.  It was on toasted sourdough, lots of avocado...very good.  Perfect size salad and half sandwich for lunch.  Service was great, food was good.  I was a fan.  My only complaint...not even really a complaint was that the drink was very pricy.  $8.25 for a cocktail at lunch.  Glass was filled to top with ice, so not really a lot of drink in it.    It wasn't like the huge old school ""Trader Dicks"" cocktails that we were all spoiled with in the 90's and 2000's.  Just a regular cocktail.  I mean it was good, don't get me wrong, but $8.25 a tad bit pricy for this type of place. I expect high prices in some places for drinks, just not here.   Oh well, it was good.  Like I said, not really a complaint.  It was delicious...and I will order one again.   So all in all...I give it a yay and we will go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=80

Addison G.,"Tempe, AZ",22,91,4,2.0,12/20/2016,"I was extremely disappointed with tonight's service.  Firstly, I have Celiacs and have always appreciated their gf menu. The balsamic chicken was my favorite. WAS. Apparently they removed it from the menu. You removed the best gluten free dish you had. The only other options now left are either a rib eye (yeah, you're trying real hard to be gluten free), and a few other dishes that really only people with specific tastes will like, which I didn't have. Having Celiacs, I'm already limited in what I can eat, and now you've removed really the ONE gf dish I did like? I doubt we'll ever be returning to BJ's because of this decision.  Not only that, but the staff really didn't understand what gluten free meant. That is always the most important thing to me, that the staff be properly trained in understanding gluten. It was obvious they did not here. The service was also subpar tonight. While our waitress was friendly, the service and receiving our food was extremely slow (it's a Tuesday night! Hardly anyone was there!). Our food took way longer than average to arrive.  All other servers/hosts were curt and not very friendly.

The food was OK. The second time we were greeted and seated quickly, but the table was sticky and small for our group.  We asked that we be moved to a larger table or booth if one came available.  We were quickly moved and then forgotten.  It took the better part of 45 minutes to get someone to come take our drink order and bring us menus.  Then after many attempts to get help from various servers we had someone come take our order but we never received drinks.  After another 45 minutes, we still had no food and no drinks. Finally, one person in our group went to the hostess station to talk to a manager.  The manager came to the table and appologised and said he would look into it.  Eventually, the orders came. Many were wrong and they were all cold. My chicken was undercooked, one sandwich order was soggy, and one fish plate came that we didn't even order. Everything that could go wrong did.  When we were finally done we couldn't get anyone to bring us our check.  The manager was very unconcerned with the whole situation.  He offered to comp us for the fish (Which we didn't order anyway) and bring us a dessert of our choice.  We declined. At this point, our meal had taken the better part of 3 hours.

I feel this place is extremely overrated, I mean if you walk in an establishment with a revolving door, you expect to eat the food of Gods. It was just regular ol' if you ask me.  They brew their own beer, so I thought I'd try the Hopstorm IPA. It wasn't too great, it just tasted like a regular Bud light with some IPA flavored mio drizzled on top.  I had some fried calamari for an appetizer and it was pretty good. Nothing special however as it was just fried calamari with marinara and lemon pepper aioli, but alas, I like both of those things. The Hickory Brisket Burger was my entree of choice tonite, it comes with a lean burger cooked to order smothered with sweet and tangy barbecue sauce, hickory smoked bacon, red onion, amd chedder-jack cheese.

We waited at least 40 mins for flat bread nachos that were nearly burnt and mostly covered with lettuce.   I had Clam Chowder or should I say a salt lick as one of my sides. I also ordered the a slab of ribs. They weren't tender and didn't have much sauce. In the past, at other locations they've  been really good.  That's the whole reason we went. I was craving their ribs.  My husband ordered a pizza. Half of it had no sauce or cheese. No idea how that happened. We brought it to our waitress attention. She said ""it's cool, I'll get the manager."" And took the pizza. She had a I dont care attitude and acted like we were a inconvenience.   We waited 15 mins before she came back and told us they were working on another pizza.  I ended up sharing my food with my husband. I couldn't eat in front of him when he had nothing.  The 2nd pizza took a half hr. We told the waitress to have them box it for us. At that point my husband and I were full from my food. The manager FINALLY showed up with the 2nd pizza, apologized, said he felt bad and told us that he will speak with the kitchen staff so when we come back next time we shouldn't have any issues.  Seeing that it was my birthday lunch they offered me a free dessert. At that point I was extremely irritated and ready to get the heck out of there.  My hub told them not to bother and to bring the check.

Nicholas L.,"Reno, NV",28,70,5,5.0,1/7/2017,"This is our go to place for a work lunch because it's close by, plus I've been here at least a half dozen other times over the last few years. And I've never had a meal that I wouldn't describe as, at a minimum, pretty darn good.   I'll just go through a few things I've had in lieu of doing a more general review: 1. Southern fried chicken.  It's awesome.  Crispy & juicy (boneless) chicken breast on top of mashed potatoes with some gravy and succotash.  They have a smaller portion for lunches vs dinner and I got the lunch portion and after eating half of it became extremely angry that I hadn't ordered the dinner portion.  It was damn good. 2. Late night burger.  Had this last week and it's listed as new on their menu and it was awesome.  Open face burger with chili verde and bacon and a fried egg?  Come on.  Chili verde is my jam and what I gauge every mexican restaurant on, and theirs was better than many.   3. Avocado egg rolls.  Super good. 4. Calamari.  Better than most.  I wouldn't say it's exceptional, but it's above average. 5. Spinach and artichoke dip.  Again, very good.   6. Ahi poke.  It's a bunch of good quality fish and nice ripe avocado.  I.e. it is lovely.   7. Clam chowder.  Very well done.  I've had worse at dedicated seafood restaurants. 8. Pizza.  Only had it once and it was the lunch sized (for one) ""gourmet five meat"" pan pizza.  Very good.  Good enough that I want to order one or two of their big pizzas even though they're not a pizza place. I honestly can't think of a single thing I'd fault them on.  Food is good.  Service is good.  Place is nice.  Things arrive quick when you're there for lunch and trying to get in and out.  In terms of ""American"" food, this is the place in Reno.  If anyone doesn't really like it they're probably being a picky assholomio. In terms of American food I guess Hash House would be the other big competitor in Reno.  Hash House to me is really more of a breakfast/lunch place though, whereas BJs isn't (since they're not open for breakfast).  Hash House has some great dinners too (I remember a duck dish that was killer) but in general BJs wins on variety and Hash House wins on quantity.  BJs probably wins on quality too, but I think it's pretty close.  Both have quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=100

Brianna D.,"Reno, NV",115,42,23,5.0,2/15/2016,"Again, I try to avoid the reviews on chain restaurants but BJ's has a special place in my heart. I have a really bad habit of going to restaurants and ordering the same thing every single time but when it comes to BJ's, the entire menu looks delicious so it's one of the only places I venture out of my comfort zone and I'm never disappointed.  My parents and I go here every time they're in town, we always pick BJ's to have dinner. We typically start out with the calamari or the avocado egg rolls. (My mom does their rewards program and we got our appetizer for free on our last visit!!) My parents normally go for steak or fish and I normally try something different every other visit. Especially now that they expanded their menu! After going multiple times my top pick for the appetizer is the avocado egg rolls hands down. The dipping sauce they provide is amazing and its a good portion to share between the three of us. My top three choices for entrees is the California Club Flatbread Pizza, Seared Ahi Salad and the Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl.   Lastly, one of the best parts about going to Bj's...their famous pizookie. A delicious warm cookie topped with ice cream. I believe they have a mini size (free on birthdays), a regular size, or the option to do a pizookie ""pizza"" with a couple different flavors. I'm almost positive I've tried all the flavors over the years and once again, never disappointed. The triple chocolate is amazing as well as the red velvet and the pumpkin flavor (might be seasonal).    When it comes to the staff, I've always had very polite waiters/waitresses, the employees up front lack professionalism but regardless, I come for the food and with more choices on the menu than ever, I'm excited to continue going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=100

Susan A.,"Reno, NV",55,131,275,3.0,5/19/2015,"The reason why I gave BJ's a three star is because I had a very bad experience about four years ago with them. This time I decided to give them a second chance. The pulled pork sandwich was very good. It had been onion strings on top of the sandwich. It came with a side of barbecue sauce to pour on top of your pulled pork sandwich. I wanted to eat the whole thing but I was trying to save some room for dessert.  The dessert was phenomenal. It was like baked cookies with ice cream on top. We were able to choose our own flavor. I highly recommend getting the Pizookie.  As for the children's food, my son ordered mac & cheese. It wasn't that great; of course, it's stated it was from the kraft mac & cheese box. When trying it it tasted like it's been sitting for a while and has been warmed up. He did receive :-) potatoes to go with his meal. They were not like a usual potato (wedge).  As for the service, our waiter was very nice and respectful. Waiting on the food did take a little bit longer than a normal wait. But I do have to put in the consideration that they just build about 10+ tables at the same time they seated us.

The service that night was (mostly) wonderful. The server answered our questions and was quick refill drinks and check on us. The women who were working up front looked annoyed and bored. They weren't very pleasant. I've noticed on most occasions I've gone there the people working up front are never very friendly.  I decided to update my review because I have been back there since and the food was better (though I still always tell anyone I go with not to order the pizza) and the service was better.

Drew R.,"Reno, NV",152,140,266,4.0,1/20/2015,"Four stars you may question and yes I know it's just a chain but hey, they've revamped and they are doing much much better!  I can say a few years ago BJ's, it seemed, had given up and were definitely in a full on downhill coast to monotony. More recently they have made drastic improvements and it is a welcome change.  The beer has always been very good so if you are into the microbrews, enjoy; now you can also return for the food. On this occasion, for my first time, I had one of the deep dish pizzas. Ermergersh! It was really really good. The Mediterranean Pizza had most of what you'd expect: chicken, basil pesto, feta cheese, and obviously a crust. What wasn't so obvious was the sliced pepperoncinis, the kalamata olives, and the roasted garlic. I must admit the garlic had the more subtle note but likely because I've fried my taste buds years ago with garlic: I mean to say I never met a garlic anything I didn't like, and moreover have literally spent days being told how badly I stink because of the garlic [fill in the blank] that I ate somewhere. The nice twist for me was that, as is the norm in pizza, they didn't make a point of leaving a huge crusty edge, but instead monopolized on every inch of real estate available and topped all of it with ingredients. Don't get me wrong the crust was really good and I do like my pizza crusts but it's also about the toppings and this was a delicious blend of ingredients.  I nearly forgot to mention this but even some of the appetizers are fun and a nice tweak. Who doesn't love a Frito boat? Well they've revamped the Frito boat with Frito nachos and it is appealing and yummy on that sophomoric (I'd like the captain crunch, please) level. I could only gripe slightly about consistency, as location seems to play a significant role in how the appetizer turns out; they're still pretty derned good.  In any event I sometimes yelpolaine that this or that restaurant is due for a menu revamp and gratefully BJ's beat me to the bitchosphere completing the process before I asked them to do so. I look forward to their continued progress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=100

The key here is to do call ahead seating because if there isn't a table open the wait can be long.  They have a very expansive menu with something for everyone (burgers, nachos, steaks ect.). The service is usually pretty good although we get better service at the south location.  Sometimes you can get an inattentive server BUT it has been getting better over the last six months.

Rachel B.,"Reno, NV",1,60,3,2.0,8/10/2016,"Here's the thing... BJ's is a chain restaurant, it's similar to going to Chili's or another similar place to eat. I think the mistake people make is going here expecting mind blowing brewery food, if you want that head to one of the local brewery's. That being said, if you are a fan of chain restaurant style food, they have pretty good food. Sometimes they are a bit of a hit or miss and if you go here in the evenings or weekend you should expect a hefty wait. I have easily spent 45 minutes waiting for a table. I personally do not find BJ's to be anything special. They are a pricy chain restaurant with decent food. They used to have a really delicious salmon Thai Salmon, it was around $18 (pricy) but the sauce was pretty delicious. They have since taken that off of the menu and I have not found any of their other salmon dishes to be anywhere near as good... especially with the accompanied price tags. I also find their customer service to be a little off point. I've had a mug of ginger-ale spilled all over my clothes by a waitress and received no compensation even though I was completely dripping in ginger-ale and I also had another waitress argue that my ID was not real and once another waitress confirmed my ID was in fact real, she brought back drinks that were clearly non-alcoholic cocktails.

Personally, I really only wanted calamari and wings, which are both appetizers. They were both average in taste, with the calamari being a bit too crispy, but good for ""bar food."" My friend had a brewhouse burger and it was very good according to him.  Lastly, we saved room for dessert with the Pizookie Trio which was fantastic. I love the concept and the taste solidified that love. Neither of us are intense sweet lovers so the trio was a bit overwhelming but I loved the crunchiness and the moist middle.

He said he would let the manager know, who then talked to us shortly after and apologized for the mistakes. When we received our bill, the manager had comped all of our burgers!

They also have a great variety of drinks. I always like it here, but my last 5 experiences haven't been good.  I notice the place is a little desorganized. The servers don't know who they are serving, they get confused all the time. They forget to bring what you order. There is always someone binging something to your table and asking if that's what you order. It's just crazy!!  The quality of the food went down but know is going up again. When I go there I normally get clam chowder, one time they served it cold and it totally ruined it. I love their burgers and their french fries. I also like their fried chicken and mashed potatoes. The deep dish lasagna wasn't very good last time I had it. It was cold in the middle and had a weird taste.  The last time I had ribs... I think those were the meatless ribs I've ever had.  The only reason I come here is because it's close home, their drinks are great! My favorite is the famous watermelon mojito. That drink is a bomb!! I love it!!

Honestly, I'm usually not a fan of chains like this, but I've never had a bad experience at any location I've been to and I've never had a bad meal. It's not my first choice, but in situations like this, I don't have any problem eating there. One thing I didn't know that they did was offer guest brews on their taps. So, there happened to be a beer brewed by Great Basin on tap, in addition to some California brewers, along with BJs beers. I thought that was pretty cool.  On this most recent visit, I decided to stay a little healthy and not order a gigantic hamburger. The Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos called my name, and even the side of grain salad sounded great too. Of course we ruined any health benefits of that by ordering the southwest egg rolls (seriously, I love these things and I love the chipotle dip that comes with them - such a guilty pleasure). The tacos were nicely stuffed, they didn't really skimp on anything and there was plenty of sauce to add to both of them. I loved all of the flavors and would definitely get it again. The disappointing part was the side salad. Kind of lacking in flavor and majorly lacking in portion. I think they gave me *maybe* a ¼ cup. I could see the bottom of the dish, like it was kind of just smeared around to appear like I had more? I don't know. I made up for lack of grain salad by stealing the addicting shoe string fries off my boyfriend's plate. Service was quick and were didn't feel rushed out of there.

I can never resist. The best part is they come to the table in a great mug, and there is usually a small layer of little icy particles on top. It is the perfect soda experience to compliment all of their food. The deep-dish pizza is a regular go-to, if you haven't had it before. It has great crust, and even better sauce.

We asked him if he was okay and told him to take his time and that he looked sick and he sheepishly said he would be okay. My husband told him maybe you should have another person take the orders and go home before he fell over and he said he was sorry and he had attempted to stay home and was denied. What kind of resteraunt forces admittedly sick people to work... The last thing you want are ill people handling your food.

Food   Appetizer - none order.   Main Course - I went with something new, outside my box for BJ's.  I had the fish tacos, breaded as that is how I had fish tacos the very first time.  These were not the fisherman on the box fish sticks.  Each piece was unique in size and shape, the two tacos each had to two bread Mahi tuna chunks in them.  The tuna was topped with a zesty slaw.  The plate had some so so colored tortilla chips.  They gave you two square cups, one salsa which was pretty mild and the other was a very thinned out guacamole.  Both were very bland.  A spoon to serve to apply to the tacos would be nice, but I guess I could have just picked them up and poured them where I want it.   Dessert - My daughter had the Pizookie, I did not have any has she was fitting off a cold.  But it was less than 2 bucks on the kids menu and it makes her really happy getting it. Service - We were greeted before we were all they in the door.  She asked if we wanted a kids menu, I said yes.  We were seated immediately, but without the kids menu.  I asked for a kids menu after realizing he did not bring one.  The nonverbal queue was it was such a trauma.  I hate to see if we sat in the back of the restaurant, but we were the closest to the hostess stand.  I was waitress was good.  My office gave us mystery gift cards, you do not know how much is on them until you bring them in.  I brought in two use, figure I would only use the bigger one but the waitress used both, excellent!

Elizabeth P.,"Sparks, NV",1,45,10,1.0,3/4/2016,"So here I sit thinking how can a company that has such great food keep allowing such low quality service ??  Last night a group of 4 of my family sit down to dinner .  It's about 10 till 7 . Happy hour is over at 7 .  When the waitress comes to our table I ask her what's the specials for the happy hour ? .  She responses by looking at her watch and telling me I have 8 minutes to order .  Wow !  Was this Like a huge red flagging saying Warning , Warning , Will Robinson ?? ( yes I'm old and those who remember Lost In Space will get it ) .  I explain that is not what I asked I wanted to know the menu specials .  She tells me and  leaves . Comes back for our order and when my soup is delivered a bit later I ask for Tabasco .  She leaves the table with everyone at the table confused ... Did she hear me ? There was no response of sure no problem or just a minute . But she did come back with some .  We ordered the avocado eggrolls.  If you have never had these they are super awesome !  Along with our other menu items .  When she comes back we have not only our appetizers but our main dishes too .  All at the same time .  I asked her why is the appetizer with our meal ? She tells me well you didn't say anything different . I said well I just figured it was implied the appetizer would come before the meal .  Guess I was wrong on Assuming that .   But the 30 plus times before when I have visited must have been a mistake ?   Yes , I'm still not happy because it only gets worst .  At this point , I leave the table go outside and call for a manger on the phone .   I am on hold for 9 mins . I have the cell phone records to prove it . 9 mins for a manger ? So after 9 mins I walk back inside and tell the lady answering the phone I'm still on hold and would like to talk to a manger .  One arrives , then second one . Explain what has happened from the moment I sat down .  Oh by the way my two kids ordered kids meals and did finally get their drinks after they had both eaten their meals .  So manger says he will take care of things . Takes off the $7 avocado eggrolls And a $5 kids meal . I am  appalled that with this lack of Professional service , both from the waitress and the manger staff with the handling of things . My own food was cold , since I had to wait over 10 mins to talk to a manger .  My kids had no drinks with their meals , my waitress was rude , unprofessional and lacking in her skills as a server .  I missed out on eating with my family .  So thank you BJs for taking that whole  $12 off my meal .  I guess my time lost , cold meal , no drinks and a rude waitress  is worth $12 . As I waited outside for a manger to answer the phone I could see both Olive Garden and the outback .  Both restaurants that seem to know what service is .  Maybe someone higher up the manger chain will care .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=160

When we actually got seated though, service was incredibly slow! Waited another 10 minutes before our server greeted us and took our drink order. We decided to order our whole meal, including the Pazookie dessert judging from how long the service was taking.  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos with a Cesar Salad and boyfriend ordered The Brewhouse Burger. Food was delicious, but we there was a 25 minute wait for our food. They even forgot my to bring out my salad first, so I had to ask for it when the entree came out.  Pita Tacos were great! The pita bread went extremely well with the mixed Greek tastes inside, which was chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes and it came with a side of quinoa mixed with corn and other deliciousness. My boyfriend's burger came out perfectly medium rare with the bun just utterly so crisp and them shoestring fries, mmm.  After our meal, there was another 20 minute wait for the Pazookie. If you've never had a Pazookie in your life, I recommend trying it before you die. A freshly baked warm cookie topped with 2 scoops of vanilla that melts right in our mouth! We got ours half chocolate chip and half white chocolate macadamia nut.  Our server also forgot to refill our drinks a few times, we had to ask her twice.

When seated they put us in a booth I am not a small guy you should never put some one my size in a booth. We order drinks and appetizer and dinner at one time that was a mistake it all came out at the same time. I guess our waitress was not smart enough to spread them out was trying to make things easer on her ordering at one time seeing that it took her 15 min after our drinks were order to get them to us. Dimmer came and my wife said that her hamburger was good she asked how mine was and I told her it was cold not ice cold but not piping hot either. She said that her fries were not hot either. All the time our waitress is standing at the server station she never comes over and ask how our dinner was she must have know how long it had set up there the appetizer was hot and ok the boneless wings I had the jambalaya.

I'm no germophobe, but I'm not exactly cool with getting coughed on and my personal items handled by a sick hostess in a restaurant. Service was slow and awful, the server forgot my salad, which was the reason I went in the first place. I was going to order dessert, but we had to be somewhere by 7 (Target, in the same parking lot) and I was afraid we wouldn't make it in time.  I'm glad I didnt, because we had to find a manager to get our check, gave the waitress our credit card, and it took at least 10 minutes to get it back. I mean, I'm no restaurant manager, but I dont think you should have a sick hostess greeting your customers.

Stacey A.,"Truckee, CA",224,6,48,4.0,1/9/2014,"I came here with a couple friends for a quick lunch after shopping at Legend's, and I was surprised with the atmosphere and affordability.  Being both a vegetarian and a beer enthusiast, I had more than enough options. The menu is huge! We started off with some fried artichoke hearts. I don't even really like artichokes all that much, and these were delicious and came with a super-tasty (possibly lemon aioli) dipping sauce.  It took us a while to decide on beer because there was just such an abundance of options. It was tempting not to go for one of BJ's beer samplers, but the bottled selection of various Belgian beers was just too good to pass up. I ended up trying a saison from Dupont which turned out to be my favorite saison of all time. No, I'm not exaggerating. I'd go back just for that beer. I tried to order another, but they were all out, so I got a Green Flash Triple IPA. This beer is super hoppy yet surprisingly well-balanced and flavorful for its style. It's also around 10%, so you know...it's well worth the $7.95.  If you're on a budget, you really can't go wrong with the lunch specials which are all in the $6-10 range. I got a margarita flatbread with a house salad for $6.95, and it was more than enough food. I was also considering the soup and half sandwich, the small portion of pasta, or the unlimited soup and salad, all under $10. All in all, the beer selection really shined, and the food was cheap and tasty.

Virginia M.,"Reno, NV",193,146,18,2.0,12/20/2014,"Salads are already kinda disappointing. Even the good ones are basically lawn trimmings slathered in lard-sauce and salt. So a bad salad is like gas station coffee.  -That's also cold.  -That also has chunks of the grind floatin' around in there.  -That's also had a throat lozenge dissolve in the carafe.  So yeah, my salad was like that.  And it wasn't so much that the Cobb salad I ordered came with soggy ham. It's not so much that I care to think about how ham becomes soggy (not moist, mind you. Soggy. Picture Wonderbread in a puddle).  It's not even the fact that the tomatoes may as well have been red-colored tasteless jello bits. Or that they must've ran down to the just-closing Port of Subs for their bottom-of-the-pan lettuce trimmings/emptied shredder tray. Or that on top of all this tasteless wonderment, they drizzled a nice little wisp of still-tasteless dressing; enough to cover the one bite that I should've just stuck with. Or that this entire bowl of ""meh"" was hacked with a weed wacker til it resembled a rice pilaf. No, none of this is what really set me over the edge, my friends. It's the fact that I was already so hungry, and we were already running late for a movie, that I just ate the damn thing. Which is why I can now review this salad, albeit to my chagrin, with such accuracy.  if you're feeling the need to eat at the woefully named BJs, then please just trust me on this.... and skip the Cobb.

Jennifer S.,"Sparks, NV",70,198,15,2.0,3/23/2015,"I used to eat at the Sparks BJ's all the time because I live so close.  I've only ate at the Reno location once.  When I ate at the Reno location I remember thinking the ambiance was nicer, the wait staff better and the food tastier but I never had huge issues with the Sparks location so I continued to go in. Of late however, my tune is changing. The wait staff is hit and miss.  Sometimes you get a great server and sometimes it is the opposite - spacey and forgetful.  It really depends on the day.   I teetered between 2 and 3 stars before finalizing my thoughts on this review and settled on 2 because ""Meh.  I've experienced better"" really reflects my feelings more than ""A-OK"".  This is due to a few recent experiences with wait staff and, suprisingly enough, the condition of the bathrooms. The first was when we went to BJ's for a sit down meal.  Afterwards we ordered a to-go for my son on a seperate tab.  They waited 48 hours to put my charge through. When I contact the store I received a call from the corporate office - I called them back and havent heard anything since then. Saturday night was the kicker.  We have never gone in for late night but we decided we'd like some real food as opposed to fast food.  We called ahead and sat at the bar.  Mind you - they are open until 1 a.m. I believe and we got in at 9:15 p.m.  It took the 2 bartenders quite some time to ask us if we would like anything.  We both ordered a beer.  I went to the restroom and it was a disaster area and out of toilet paper (see pics).  Once seated back at the bar I looked down and noticed a dirty knife on the floor (see pic). After while I decided I wanted another beer but the waiters were ignoring us.  They had already put our bill in a random shot glass in front of us assuming that's all we wanted.  I asked for another beer and the male server got really annoyed with me, got my beer, ripped away the old receipt and tossed the new one in the glass and walked away.  Wow....just wow.  We got our to-go order and left. Will I go back?  Of course I will.  It's the only sit down place of it's kind in a 15 mile radius of my house.  Will I enjoy the food?  I hope so.  Will I be excited?  No.  Will I ever go back for late night?  No way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=200

We were told our table was ready without getting our appetizer, but our waitress assured us she would bring it to our table.

Ron D.,"Sparks, NV",39,21,23,3.0,12/8/2014,"Okay, I do like BJ's Brewhouse and the quality of their food, the only real problems I've ever had was slow service whilst sitting in a booth, in the bar area never an issue. My other problem(s) is, now correct me if I am wrong here, but when you think happy hour you think select appetizers at a reasonable discount, right? The thing that bothers me most is their so called ""Happy Hour prices"", they are completely deceptive as it's not any cheaper because they make their Happy Hour appetizers half the size(not in their menu anywhere does it say half the normal order) of what they would normally be, hence your still paying full price, see for yourself the next time you are there. Chicken wings for example; you get ten wings off happy hour and five (which in itself is slightly insulting) during their so called ""Happy Hour"", Pot Stickers aren't quite half the order but still slightly insulting when you see the quantity (4), and lastly, their craft beers are a dollar off putting them at four dollars each, not that great of a ""Happy Hour"" price either in my opinion. I'm not looking to get anything for free and as I said their food is good, but when you order five wings for five dollars, four pot stickers for five dollars, two beers at four dollars each, and my wife had some fancy drink that was $9.75 (Strawberry Splash I believe it was) granted it tasted good, but come on! $10 for a drink is a bit expensive/out of line! Our bill came to $28 and change for everything not including the tip, that didn't feel like Happy Hour at all to me, or my wallet. So if you're looking for ""Happy Hour"" prices at BJ's Brewhouse, you'll have to look elsewhere because you won't find it there. Again, the food is good, but 5 wings, 4 pot stickers, and 3 drinks for $28 (tip not included) is really hard to swallow. I would only give them 2 1/2 stars if possible and only completely because of their pricing, look, wings and pot stickers are/is some of the cheapest bar foods you can buy, and honestly, the don't differ very much from place to place. You can argue you get what you pay for, but like I said, ""wings and pot stickers"" folks, ""wings and pot stickers"". $18 dollars for three drinks during happy hour!

I just wish that tonight the soup had a little more chicken then what it came with tonight. However, still very yummy. The deep dish pizzas we had were outstanding as always. My two favorite are the Mediterranean and the Buffalo Chicken! BJ's never fails to stuff so many flavorful toppings on their pizzas! The Mediterranean was so fresh tasted so incredible with the grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. Oh my goodness so good! The Buffalo Chicken had diced celery, red onions and grilled chicken breast marinated in a spicy buffalo sauce drizzled with ranch dressing and buffalo sauce. I normally have a difficult time with buffalo sauce as it is normally too spicy for me to eat much of it. I think this pizza has just enough spice that I can feel it on my lips and in my mouth but not enough that would cause me to be a fire breathing dragon!!! It is a perfect combination with the toppings and the sauces. You may all be thinking why so much food?  Well... because they are even better the next morning/afternoon cold or hot! LEFT OVERS! We finished with the pizookie for dessert. I was very sad as they did not have my favorite pizookie, red velvet. They are changing their menu and are not continuing with the red velvet. SO disappointing because that is one of my favorites. My other favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut which never ever disappoints. Perfectly baked so that it still is soft in the middle but crunchy on top. The vanilla bean ice cream is the next piece that completes the dessert. So good. Since we had to order two for the meal deal we also got the chocolate chip, which is good, but for me I would have rather of had the red velvet. Overall, the service was quick and the food was delivered promptly. The food was awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=220

Well, u were left with the remaining buck fifty... I will not eat here again and evidently all the employees at my work are also avoiding this place due to the insane prices.  Perhaps YOU should do the same.

A U.,"Truckee, CA",0,60,4,2.0,7/6/2013,"Less than a pleasant experience, in general. Drinks order and appetizer order went fine. Then as we waited and waited for our pizzas, waiter stopped by. Said that he made an error and admitted to forgetting to place our food order. No problem to me. Very professional. Admitted error. That would be enough to satisfy me.  Said that the manager was coming over to talk to us. Manager delivered dinner about 10+ minutes later and gave us a different story. Said that they made one of the pizzas wrong and had to redo, hence the time delay. Well, I believe the waiter, but it doesn't matter. They did comp us the appetizer and 1/2 of each pizza, but it would have been okay without doing that. I didn't ask for that, but they offered. Took them up on it. That will keep me from holding a lifelong grudge. We did wait over 30 minutes after our appetizer was done for dinner.  Other minor things wrong, but when there's enough of them, they start to add up. Forgot one of the table settings, so missing a napkin for a while after appetizer arrived. One pizza was clearly not cooked enough. Cheese wasn't melted fully. Coffee with no cream. Got the cream, realized that the coffee was cold. Waiter was focused more on table of young ladies next to us which I think contributed to the issues. Desserts were incorrectly delivered to the table of young ladies next to us. Person who brought it out changed course, threw them down on our table and walked away. We looked at each other. Really? I'll be back.

Matthew H.,"Sparks, NV",9,7,6,1.0,9/26/2012,"I had to take a few days to cool off before writing this review. Let be begin by saying that I overall I love BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. I have eaten at BJ's all over the west coast and I normally leave very happy after drinking good beer, eating good food, and receiving excellent customer service. The review that I am writing today is in no way is reflective of BJ's as a whole; this review is only for its location in Sparks Nevada. On Saturday September 22, 2012 I decided to meet family for dinner. We chose to go to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse at the Legends in Sparks Nevada. We arrived shortly before 4pm and sat down at a dirty table in the bar area. It took several minutes for a waitress to notice us and come to collect the check and dirty glasses from the previous patrons. At 4:04pm we ordered an appetizer, nachos and beer, we asked our waitress ""Dee"" about happy hour. She replied that ""we don't have happy hour on Saturday."" I pointed to the sign on the table that stated happy hour during all college and professional football games and motioned to the two games that were currently displayed on the huge TV above the bar. Our waitress replied with ""I have no idea what's going on"" and left to put our order in. At 4:07pm I could see our beers had been poured by the bartender and were sitting on the bar waiting for our waitress to come run them. There we sat until 4:21pm when our waitress brought water out to our table told us that is was in fact happy hour and asked if we were ready to order, we asked about the beer we ordered that we could see sitting on the counter getting flat for the last 14 minutes and our appetizer. She replied ""I can't run them right now; I was hoping someone else would have."" She walked around for a minute and then went to get our beer. At 4:24pm our beer was finally delivered to the table and she took our order for dinner. Someone from the kitchen came out with our nachos at 4:27pm, there was not silverware on the table and we were hungry so we just went and got them ourselves to avoid any further problems. At 4:30pm our waitress came to check on us, I ordered a second beer. I could see my beer get poured and was sitting on the bar at 4:33pm once again it just sat there until another server decided to bring it to the table at 4:46pm. The food finally arrived at 4:51pm, the food was good however my sandwich was served with far fewer fries than are normally served with meals and the plates were lacking the normal presentation I have come to expect from BJ's. It took over 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get a beer, at a Brewhouse I find highly unacceptable. The restaurant and bar had a typical Saturday crowd, it was by no means busy, and the restaurant looked adequately staffed. I would have voiced my complaints to a manager but there was no manager in sight most of the time we were there. As a frequent BJ's customer I have become accustomed to having a manager come by at least once during the meal to check on me. This did not occur, the only time I saw a manager during our visit was when two people who appeared to be managers came out from the back to stand behind the registers chatting with employees and divvying out tips in with the other staff in front of customers (See attached photos). I find 5 people standing behind a register while my beer is sitting on the bar getting warm and flat appalling. I would not write a review after one bad experience but a situation similar to this occurred about a month before when I had lunch at this location. I feel this location is lacking sound management and the restaurant as a whole is suffering. Poor employee education, training and the lack of management support and oversight lead to poor customer service and upset customers as a result. Luckily for BJ's I have had the pleasure of eating at other locations where I have become accustomed to enjoying great beer food and customer service at other locations. After two bad experiences in a row I will not be returning to the location in Sparks Nevada.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=240

Cheryl L.,"Reno, NV",10,2,,4.0,4/2/2014,"#reno Wednesday night about 5:30.  It was fairly crowded but our party of four was seated right away.  Our server was super friendly and did his best to get our order within a reasonable amount of time.  It was obvious he was a little stressed and was struggling to keep up with his tables.   Our order was delivered about 45-55 minutes later, our kids were literally withering away to nothing.  We ordered four entrees - deep dish pizza, flatbread pizza, parmesan crusted chicken and a kid's mac & cheese.  Each item was lukewarm at best.  The tomatoes my daughter asked to be omitted were covering her chicken.  The fries she requested instead of mashed potatoes had also been forgotten. When our server finally had a chance to return to our table, we had gone ahead and started eating.  It was bordering on cold but still good. We mentioned the temperature of the entrees as well as the special requests.  He apologized profusely and insisted on a visit from the manager.  Before the manager visited our table, our server had brought a hot plate of fries for my daughter. The manager joined for us for quite a few minutes at our table as we talked about all our other great experiences with BJ's.  We love the food here and even when it arrived a little chilly, the manager and server both redeemed themselves and made it a great night for us.

We didn't bother sending it back. They never gave us plates and we were a party of 4. I got my soup about 20 minutes before my salad. Just awful. Sadly, there isn't another BJ's around so we have to continue to come to this location. Food took especially long today and we weren't happy. At this point I'm not spending any more money at this location. We won't be back. Let me add that our order was wrong!

But when I woke up at 2am with diarrhea, that's where I drew the line.  It would be one thing if this were an isolated incident, but frankly, this Sparks location has always given us trouble. I can honestly say that 1 out of every five orders I place there are correct. The service is always hurried, the servers are sweaty and look panicked (we were just there last night on a Wednesday, so it's not like we only go during the weekend rush).

Chelsie Y.,"Reno, NV",34,13,,1.0,3/30/2014,"Before I begin let me emphasize what a huge fan I am of the Bjs brand..as you will find in my previous ""check ins"" I avid the South Reno location, and am a HUGE fan. I am so sad to have to leave this review as I have prided myself in only praising incredible acts of service.. But..Here it goes.. We have tried this location for date nights before and were not impressed due to like warm or overly salty food.. But as a fan we decided to try it a fourth time.. Today our  party called at 4:00 to reserve a table of 16 people (4 of which were toddlers) for 5:30. My 25 month old and I arrived at 5:20 to which I was told ""we are preparing your table, as soon as 8 of your party members Arrive we will seat you."" The rest of our party arrived at 5:30-5:35. Our party host went to check us in and they said they would seat us shortly. By 6:00 we check in and are told it would be roughly 20 minutes...which would mean an hour after our reservation. At this point all of our toddlers had run laps outside of their facility several times, and were an hour past their meal times. We decided to call a near by restaurant and they were able to get us in right away. Right when we handed in our pager around 6:10 we were told ""half of our table is ready if you'd like to sit down"".Which needless to say made us feel incredibly under valued. This was our first time ever leaving a Bjs, and as a result we spent over 400 dollars at a neighboring restaurant. Half of our party lives in sparks which caused us give this location a try, unfortunately/or fortunately our weekly gatherings will have to be held back at the south reno location. Bottom line: There is a near by Bjs that prides themselves with impeccable customer service 20 minutes away. They often offer samples to those waiting, etc.. Look up ""Reno Bjs"".

S L.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,173,,3.0,10/9/2012,"Chain restaurant. Dinner with a couple of doctors. Apparently, the favorite for the local medical group for entertaining guests because of the GIANT SELECTION. Honestly, this menu was twice as large as any other BJ's I've been to. Setting: Situated in the Sparks shopping mall, this restaurant is ideally located for the hungry shopper. There is bountiful parking with multiple entrances and exits. The general feel of the restaurant is similar to that of other BJ breweries. The main difference is the abundance of televisions plastered along every wall. The only drawback is that every single one was showing the same game. What if you didn't like football? Stinks for you cause that's what you're watching. Tables are appropriately spaced such that traffic is never impeded, even at full capacity. We went on a Monday night, very low traffic. Waiter: Energetic and friendly with a generally happy disposition. I'm not sure all waiters do this but he was very systematic regarding taking orders. A refreshing change from the several occasions where I've had to repeat my order several times. He was quick with our refills. Given that we had a relatively large party, I appreciated the fact that he updated us with the status on our food several times. Definitely one of the pluses of this particular outing. Food: Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza. As always, cooked to perfection. The crust was slightly buttered and crispy, the perfect combination for pizza. The deep dish pizza was indeed, thick, possibly measuring about 1 inch in depth. BBQ roasted to the point where it was slightly spicy. They may have skimped on the tomatoes a little bit. Lucky for me, they compensated with chicken. PROTEIN!!! Didn't get the desert but the pizooky is highly recommended. Drinks: Diet coke. 3 refills in 1 hour. Not sure if I got my money's worth.

Sent burger back, I was ok with warm chicken but didn't eat sides. My sons pizza finally came out but it was the wrong pizza, we ended up with someone else's pizza, so they corrected the order and his pizza was soon brought to the table.

The B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,14,,1.0,1/1/2014,"Well, we had to try the corporate Brewhouse to see what was cookin.  We were not surprised.  The pompous little character at the front door who was supposed greet us, needed a slap to his quaffed hair-do. Why would you put a guy like him, so arrogant at the front door is beyond me!  Most of the staff seemed like they were uncomfortable and unhappy... made us feel the same. The appetizer, Santa Fe spring rolls were tasty, probably is where we should have stopped.   Caesar salad was at best average. Nothing going on here. Brewhouse ""handcrafted"" bacon cheese burger was not inventive, just a corporate basic lackluster burger with almost average frozen fries.  Someone else brings our food to the table and auctions it off, I guess like a brewhouse does.  He doesn't see the table and our needs.  We had to ask the server for condiments, catsup and mustard.  What does handcrafted mean to these guys?  They use their hands to put an almost average burger together?  That's the best they can do.   In and Out does a better job, with a better personal experience for a third the cost and better taste.  Have you ever had a bad experience there?  Probably not.  Never in 40 years have I had an attitude or poor service in that place. And they just sell burgers. Maybe not the best, but cleaner and better attention than Joe Quaffs brewhouse. Opened up my napkin and silverware...I discreetly handed the server my knife with a gob of something smeared and dried on it,  he looks at it as if...what???  After I showed it to him in direct detail, he said, ""do you want another one?""  Come on...where do you get these rejects????  Are these the ones fired from the casinos? Expensive looking corporate atmosphere, cold, uninviting, and lack of ""handcrafted"" genuine food and service.  These guys have a lot to learn about food and service.

Carla M.,"Sparks, NV",2,33,7,5.0,12/14/2010,"When I saw that this restaurant only had a couple of stars, I decided it was time to fix that. I'd give this restaurant 10 stars if I could! They have excellent food at very reasonable prices, with A+ service. Some MUST TRY menu items are: Avacado Egg Rolls, Balsamic Chicken, Glazed Salmon, Berry Delicious (an alcoholic beverage), and of course their famous warm Pizookie (personally, I like Oreo the best). You really can't beat their prices for the quality of food. Everything is fresh, hot, and comes in large portions. I've visited their Sparks Legend's location 5 times, and their original Summit Location in Reno more than 15 times. Both locations have equally great food and service. One thing I refuse to deal with at restaurants is rude or snobby staff members - and I've never met one at either BJs. They go above and beyond, making sure you're satisfied with your order & that your drinks are full. Their full bar is quite impressive! It reaches the ceiling and is stocked to the max with just about every alcohol imaginable.  I saw that one person complained about their billing system - and yes, if there was one tiny thing I'd complain about, it is that. A couple of times, we've been given the bill before our meal was even finished. We would then need to add dessert ... and the waiter would re-tally the bill. Then we ordered some drinks.. the bill had to be done again. It seems kind of strange to go to all this work before a table is even done ordering! In another instance, we were given the bill ($60). The waiter took my card and came back saying it was denied. I looked at the new receipt, with a total of ($80). I told him that our bill stated $60, and the card had $70 available.  He had forgotten to add on our last round of drinks, which changed the total. But yet he neglected to inform us before running the card. That was a little irritating, but not a big deal. He apologized, and everything was fine.  I think they've made some positive changes to the billing issues.  When we were there 2 weeks ago, the waiter asked if we needed anything else before bringing the final bill, and even when we decided to add on 1 drink afterwards, he brought a new bill with the new total before charging the card.  All in all, BJs has provided a pleasant & fun atmosphere, stellar food, and friendly service.

Jessica P.,"Reno, NV",5,50,7,1.0,10/29/2012,"I visited BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse on a Sunday evening for dinner. I have mixed feelings about my visit there so I will write this blog and let you be the judge.   The décor in BJ's is a mix of American Pub décor and modern styles. The atmosphere is really nice and the light fixtures are very modern. The restaurant is full of red upholstered booth seats with a few pub style tables in the bar area. When I walked into the restaurant I was greeted very promptly by the hostess and I was seated right away. I was given water right away and the waitress (whose name was Lindsey and you will understand why I'm naming names this time as you read on) came by to get our drink orders. It didn't take me long to make up my mind because I have had the pizza at the location in Reno before and knew it to be some of the best pizza in town. The waitress took quite a while to get back to our table but it was REALLY busy so I expected that my dinner might take a bit. When she came back with our drinks I placed my order. I ordered the chicken wontons appetizer served Thai style for $2.95, a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette for $2.95, and a medium Spicy Meatball deep dish pizza that I requested no onions on and I wanted bacon added; the pizza was $22.75 (Sorry there is no pizza pic... got a little distracted due to the events that unfolded).   The salad arrived within minutes and was delivered to us by another waitress; it was amazing how fast the salad came out! The pizza on the other hand took forever and we also never received our appetizers; I told Lindsey when she delivered the pizza. She wasn't very friendly or apologetic about forgetting the appetizers, in fact she acted like we were an annoyance to her so I told her to just forget the appetizers. I also asked the waitress for some ranch to go with the pizza and we each wanted a new drink (we had empty glasses for quite awhile now). It only took us each a bite to realize that our pizza was wrong and when we finally were able to waive the waitress down and tell her so she literally made a disgusted gasping noise and started walking away; as she walked away she said that she would have the manager over and before she had her back turned to us I literally saw her roll her eyes at us and shake her head.... now the experience had made a turn for the worse and I was fuming; I have never been treated so horribly by a server in my entire life! (And she still hadn't brought me the ranch I requested). The manager whose name was Eric came over to find out what was going on with our order. Eric was very courteous and explained that he would have our appetizers out and our pizza remade. He also expressed that he wanted to make things right and asked up what he could do for the inconvenience. I suggested maybe comping a drink or two and he said his manager didn't like him to comp alcohol so he would come up with something else. The waitress came by a few minutes after the manager left and asked us what had happened and we told her he was remaking our pizza so she took the pizza we had in front of us away (still no ranch). Our appetizers were delivered to us by another waitress again and it was a good thing they came because I was starving... I think at this point we had been there an hour or a little over that.   The pizza still took another 20 minutes to get to us and this time it was done right. I still had not received the ranch I requested and after trying to get the waitresses attention when she passed us by two times (she was most definitely ignoring us on purpose at this point) I almost had to shout to get her to come over to our table at which point I asked her for the ranch again. She came back with the ranch about 5 minutes later. The manager came back over to our table towards the end of our meal and told us he had comped the pizza and asked if there was anything else he could do... I told him no and that he was really excellent and that I appreciated his efforts. I didn't say one word to him about how rude and atrocious our waitress was and how bad she was at being a server. I literally considered giving her no tip which I have NEVER done in my life. Even thought her service was the worst I have ever received I still gave her an $8.00 tip which is far more than she deserved.   I can honestly say that I will probably never go back to BJ's in Sparks which is too bad because they have great food and a great manager. But, if BJ's is hiring this kind of low caliber server I can't say I want to visit them again; I don't go out to eat and spend my hard earned money so I can get treated like shit by a server.. excuse my french.   It's really too bad that horror stories like this happen; do you have a restaurant horror story, because I'd love to hear it... tell me where I don't want to go eat this time!

Erica is a server in the top bar area and seriously one of the most adorable friendly faces that I just love to see serving when we go there. She is incredible and just exuberant! So helpful, always amazing suggestions and so smiley all the time! I wish I could remember all the servers names because I would love to mention them all by name, they are wonderful! They recently removed the mini bruschetta which was a big hit with my daughters, in-laws, husband and anyone else I ever brought; however the menu changes that replaced it are more than sufficient! Also, when I'm craving clam chowder I love to go here! Their clam chowder has no hints of grainy grinding dirt and is absolutely delectable! The beer selection is incredible here as well.

The wait is horrendous so never come here during dinner hours if you actually are hungry, come after 8pm or before 6pm. BUT once you are finally seated, the drinks are good and so is the food. It's nice to have TVs to watch the game or whatever and the booths are comfy. We have often had problems with their soda machine being off but I like their cocktails or lemonades better anyways. All of their appetizers are so good and huge portions like the artichoke dip or calamari. They have good burgers and pasta dishes and their ""enlightenment"" dinners are great tasting with lower calories. I just prefer the south reno one and hate waiting to be sat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=280

R M.,"Reno, NV",0,12,,1.0,8/3/2014,"A friend recommended this chain restaurant based on his experience at another one in Dallas. We arrived at the Sparks BJ'S for lunch on Sunday 08/03. We were greeted by the hostess who told us to ""wait here'. There were only 3 or 4 other parties seated in the place so why she needed to analyze her computer screen and consult with the actual seater is a mystery. After waiting a couple of minutes she seated us at a table right next to another couple....but the place was empty so we asked if we could sit at the next table over. She rolled her eyes. handed us our menus and left. We waited for 10 minutes bur nobody ever came to wait on us or take a drink order or even bring water. Guess we were being punished. We saw Chipotle across the parking lot, saved the day. We walked out, needless to say never to return again.

Steve T.,"Sparks, NV",262,708,4401,3.0,12/19/2010,"The service was good here, but the food was okay and considering it was discounted when I came during happy hour it would be too expensive during regular hours, I think. I took advantage of the happy hour special to order a mini pizza, which was half off. I also got a glass of red beer and a side salad. The waiter brought me samples of two beers and I appreciated that because I liked the second one, the red beer, much better. I'm not much of a beer drinker but I found one here I liked. I ordered the salad without croutons and it came with croutons, the only service problem I had all night. It was a pretty standard salad. When the pizza arrived the first thing I thought of was that it seemed more like a $5.12 pizza than a $10.25 pizza. Kind of expenisve. The pizza was just okay. Lots of dough and the dough didn't seem fully cooked.  I'd like to explore the menu and see if they've got anything that's killer. Update: I went back and got a pepperoni, sausage and tomato mini pizza and had them make it crispy and it was better. Also, they use really good tomato. I was impressed.  I found another beer I like.

In addition to beer, we also like pizza.  The pizza here is pretty good.  I love good deep dish pizza loaded with sauce and veggies and cheese with a nice tasty crust.  Well, I got it.  We usually get the Mediterranean Pizza and besides being slightly salty (which you'll hardly notice if you're chasing the pizza with beer) was very good.  It's probably salty because of the massive amount of kalamata olives.  The service is typical, nothing absolutely amazing but nothing absolutely horrible.

S. B.,"Reno, NV",0,9,,1.0,11/13/2013,"This place is not as good as the other BJ's in south Reno. I and several friends have been her more than a couple of times and today, I met some business associates who came into town for lunch. The place was not at all full. Our drinks and appetizer was the only thing that was ok. Everything there after went downhill. We had been there 45 min or longer and realized our food hadn't arrived and then 5 min later another waiter brought out our entrees. What happened to our soups and salads that should have came before our meal. The server looked puzzled when we asked about it. He left what he brought and said he would check on it. Our server who initially acknowledged us when we first sat down said he would bring them out. Well, the soup came and it was COLD. (clam chowder) not so good cold.  He also brought me the last one to get served my chicken pasta, that to was COLD. I was so disappointed. He brought it back, then a male manager came and apologized and said he would bring it out. I also asked how come there was no crackers, which by the way, normally comes with the clam chowder (at least at other BJ's locations I've been to), he said it should have been there. When the server heard me tell the mngr that, after the mngr left, the server said a customer needs to request it. When the entree came out from the chef who delivered it. Guess what, the pasta was COLD as well. The server came around and asked how everything was and I told him that my food is COLD again. He apologized and here comes another mngr named Tina who apologized, etc. In speaking with her my business partners also spoke up and said this wasn't the first, nor the second time there's been problems at their restaurant. Once, there was nobody in the place and was told they needed to be wait (in the lobby area) to be seated, since there was no servers, yet to have arrived at work. WOW! Anyways, me and my associates let the mngr know, we will no longer come again. After more than 3 visits, all under-par, food, service, etc. We will no longer go to that location. I wonder if that's why the place wasn't hardly occupied because of the inconsistency of how its ran.  I've been numerous times (can't even count) to the BJ's in south Reno, where there were lines out the door each and everytime, but the service, and food were good and consistent. Maybe, it's just this location. You would think that the kinks would have worked it self out, since they aren't really new anymore as far as being opened at that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=280

I was so fearful of sending it back but every single shrimp was undercooked. I received my ""re-fire"" less than ten minutes later to the same result. It wasn't just one again, so I know there must be an inexperienced chef in the kitchen. The Manager came out and advised that they have procedures to cook any type of seafood a particular amount of time and temp but there was something off. They didn't charge me the 19.95 and we ordered an appetizer and dessert of which neither was comped.

Sean W.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/24/2010,"I've been to BJ's several times in the past few years, ever since they came to the Reno/ Sparks, NV area, and have had pretty good luck.  However, tonight, was by far the worst experience I've had at a BJ's, or any local place- as far as a waitress was concerned.  First off, the waitress was just aloof and seemed to avoid our table all together. Secondly, the meal took 45 minutes to get to our table.  With that said, I am used to that. It was a busy Saturday night, and I cant expect all waitresses at all pubs to be on top of their game all the time.  However, the thing that really pissed me off was that she actually dropped our tab at our table BEFORE we got our food. We did not choose to dine at Denny's tonight. We chose to dine at a Brewery. Our waitress (who was marked as ""Amy 289 A"" on our receipt) had to redo our ticket FIVE times because we kept ordering things. We weren't demanding unusual things- we are eating at a brewery, and most folks like to drink more than one beer and maybe enjoy a desert. Our waitress never asked us if we needed more drinks (including water) or even checked on the food.  At one point, after our 4th revised tab, I asked if she was getting off shift, because she was so determined to get us out of there. She said no, and then I ordered another beer, and Amy ACTUALLY ROLLED HER EYES.  Keep in mind that we were there for one and a half hours- not an unreasonable amount of time to spend at dinner.  I am not one to complain. At all. My wife and I were both servers in college, so we know what it's like to deal with difficult people. However, I could not help but complain this time. Amy was completely rude, and the service was abysmal. For God's sake, she works at a BAR, you would think she would want to sell more beer, desert, food...anything.

I am all for quick service but this was ridiculous.   We tried to find our waiter and had to ask for another server to get him for us.   The manager don came over and told us that they were on timers and just brought food out when ready.  They did not take into account that we were out to have a relaxing evening not have our food shoved down our throats in 15 minutes so they can flip the table.      Don gave us a business card for a free dessert on our next visit.   Walked out with our food in to go containers at 6:51.  Can't imagine having one more plate on the table if we did come back and have this happen again.    Very disapointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=320

The cookies for dessert are delicious (had one before the Celiac thing hit me) and the calzones as well.

Miss B.,"Reno, NV",0,2,,1.0,11/30/2010,"We arrived, sat down quickly, and waited for our waiter. To start, he didn't understand really anything on the menu. We ordered 2 grilled chicken sandwiches, some soup, and some chicken tenders. He looked almost dumbfounded when my girlfriend was asking him about what comes on the sandwich.  Fast forward about 40-45 mins later (we went on a Monday at around noon with maybe 15 others in the restaurant) and our food arrives.  The bill arrives and it comes to almost 40 dollars. My mom pays some in cash, and I put the rest on my debit card. We wait for him to pick it up, and he goes to take care of it. Another probably almost 35 minutes go by, and he comes back, sets the bill on the table and just stands at the end of the table. I pick up the tab, and he ask's 3 times if everything is ok, did he do something wrong, etc. I say no(because at that point, everything on the bill looked to be fine), and he walks away. As he's walking away (my back is facing the front door so I can see him walk away), he turns twice and looks to make SURE we leave him a tip. Fast forward to the next morning, and I check my account. I WAS CHARGED FOR THE ENTIRE BILL. I call and speak to the manager (who seems like he doesn't know much about managing) and he said the waiter ""does not like to make mistakes, and when he does, he gets really awkward."" I tell him I was charged for the almost 40 dollars, plus what my mom paid in cash (which meant the server picked up a 20 dollar tip!!). He gives me the run around for 15 minutes about the bank this, the bank that, and how when the waiter realized what he did, the manager came over, canceled it, and re-debited my card for the 20 dollars. It's no big deal, it was an honest mistake I say, but why wouldn't the manager come over to our table and let me know? He kept saying things about the bank and I told him he wasn't answering my question. Why wouldn't the manager come over and tell me my CARD WAS CHARGED FOR 40 DOLLARS? They knew about the cancellation correct? He says yes and with a response of ""We don't normally go and talk to the customer because of how fast it goes through"" So you take 40 dollars from someone and you don't let them know? I told him I'd never go there again because it's too much of a risk, and the waiter was an idiot, along with the service I was getting from the management.  Food was mediocre, but the service was HORRIBLE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sparks?start=320
