Josh E.,"Stockton, CA",64,13,,3.0,8/20/2016,"The food and drinks here is okay, not bad but not terribly memorable either. The service, however, is really hit or miss. The bar service is usually on par with what you'd expect, but recently has gone down hill quickly. Yesterday the bar area service was disappointing, to say the least. The waiter literally threw some menus on the table in front of us, then spun around and left so quickly that I'm pretty sure the earth's rotation was slightly slowed by the momentum he generated. There was no greeting, no offer of water or drinks, and we didn't see him  (or her, I'm not sure which since they left our table so quick I didn't even get a look) for the rest of our time there. We waited 15 minutes but never saw a waiter again, so we left. The time before this, the waiter called me ""chief"" and I'm just not about that life. I wouldn't suggest coming here if it's busy, because the customer service goes downhill quickly under pressure. Other than that, it's an okay place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Yoz Y.,"Miami, FL",0,34,3,3.0,4/29/2017,"Generic tasting food.  There can not possibly be a chef in the kitchen at any BJ's.  The food looks good, yet the flavors and quality fall short.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Ms. P.,"Stockton, CA",0,42,26,4.0,4/8/2017,"Came here out of curiosity. Always seeing the place busy and in the mood to try something new, brought us in. Busy indeed, but we got a table relatively quick. Our server, Tim, made the evening for us, and since being back we have had him be our server several times, which always makes the time here enjoyable, compared to when we have been here and had a waitress who did not give us the service we were used to and we were even ignored, until we got another waitress to help us out.  The food here is very good. Flat bread or deep dish pizza, is a go to for us and I like that you can customize the flat bread pizza, Spicy pig is one of my favorites. Usually get it with mushrooms (instead of jalapeños) and BBQ for the sauce. Found out recently, it's not so easy to do with the deep dish, if it's made with a certain sauce then it HAS to be that sauce. The BBQ Root Beer ribs are delicious! Sometimes they come a little too spicy for my liking, but at the same time, the taste is worth it. Steak...yea the steaks are good. Hamburgers are very good too. Mini piezookies are a nice little treat, chocolate chip and oreo are our favorites. Also, the calamari is very good too. Overall, we keep coming back for the food and try to try something different. The menu is big, but worth it. We plan on coming back to BJ's overall, and even look for it when we are in other cities.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Robert M.,"Stockton, CA",56,189,,2.0,6/23/2016,"I am at a loss with this review. The good: Food. We ordered salmon, ahi tuna salad and a pizza. Tasted great. Our waiter was also really attentive. Four stars The bad: The pizza and salmon was delivered (longer than normal wait). At least six minutes later the seared ahi salad shows up. Is delivering all the the orders at the same time a new concept? Zero stars. I have had similar experiences with this location. Food quality is good. Table service is good. Getting the food to the table in a timely and organized manner is poor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Starr S.,"Stockton, CA",0,7,4,1.0,10/10/2015,"Generally good most nights but tonight? Nah. 12am, sitting in the bar area. Tall dark haired waitress named Mercedes would rather flirt with customers for over 10 minutes rather than take our orders, and then walked right past us  She was hot, but a 15 min wait for one water when we ordered two is ridiculous",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Daniel G.,"Stockton, CA",46,107,76,1.0,12/22/2016,"I wish hey we're as good as the Modesto location, here they slap things together decently and hope it's comparable to what's described on the menu. Severely Over cooked meat, 38 minutes waiting and counting on a Thursday. We waited 26 minutes for our waitress to ask us if we were ready to order as she laughed and spoke with co-workers. Drinks are great, hence the second star. Although I'll be coming back for the bar this is my last time coming in for food. I've waited too long, I've had two bad past experiences and I came here reluctantly with family and now they feel the same due to these outrages wait times. We arrived at 9:15pm today as I'm typing this review it's 10:04pm and have yet to receive food. It's about 20% full and fully staffed. I could grown the ingredients from scratch and made the food myself by now lol Update: I hade to reduce another star, I gave them two stars because at least the drinks are great. Now that's the only star they have left 10:51pm now: we have just left food arrive at table at 10:19 we finished at 10:34 and have been waiting to pay since. Natalie our waitress kept forgetting we existed, first we had to wait another waitress to call our waitress to order our food after sitting for half an hour, our food came out cold (keep in mind we sat 1:04 hr before being served), luckily a really nice guy, possibly the buss boy asked us if everything was fine. Not our waitress, the buss boy, I asked him to touch my sisters food and he said ""oh no, this is colder than ice, not cool, I'll be right back"" and sure enough he came back to our table with fresh food and even brought silverware because after asking our waitress she never brought any. When it came time to pay I asked Natalie for the bill twice before leaving. It was evident I didn't like my food I left the ENTIRE meal on the plate, did not ask for a to go box, and of course she didn't pick up on the context clues. My sister did get a box to go for her almost complete meal. When she asked if everything was great I responded ""it wasn't really good, I'm sorry"" which she apologized for but that's it. I'm never going to be a snob so I reluctantly paid for a meal which I didn't eat, or like or take with me. I picked up drive thru on the way home for all of us. The bus boy (I think that's what he was) was phenomenal and i wish I could have found him on the way out I had 40.00 for him !! As for my experience, this was the final nail in the coffin, I wouldn't go back even if I was offered free food for life. Complete dog$hit experience and food. I used to love this place many years ago. I am hand to god feeding my sisters left overs to our dog Cali this very moment. Silver lining = Great dog food !!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Jabin F.,"Stockton, CA",53,9,3,5.0,5/6/2017,Just had a great brunch thanks to a wonderful server Daniella.  She took good care of us and even gave me a fresh cup with hot coffee for me. Will definitely return for Brunch again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Akilah B.,"San Pedro, CA",23,60,177,1.0,3/4/2017,"This place is one of the worst BJ'S I've been to. The service is slow, which makes the food cold. The drinks were poorly made, even after the remake. And it's freezing inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60

Wenny L.,"Stockton, CA",263,17,22,3.0,3/11/2017,"I went at 12pm on a Saturday and it was almost empty. We got seated pretty quickly, and the service was great! Really quick, really nice. I ordered the deep dish gourmet five meat pizza. It did not look like the picture at all. There wasn't much meat on the pizza, but my biggest issue was that it was not an actual deep dish pizza. It was literally just a normal pizza with a lot more dough. The service was great, and the waitresses are really nice. But don't get the deep dish pizza. Just get the regular. The extra $10 is not worth the dough",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Garreth G.,"Stockton, CA",452,382,51,2.0,7/29/2016,"The only thing I recommend are the Pazooki's because it tastes delicious, if your willing to wait a long time for it. I've probably been here maybe 6 or 7 times but each time the service was slower than a Slowpoke. Seriously every time, no matter what time of day, whether its really slow or busy the service is crap. I thought I wrote a review before about this place but I'm sure it was deleted. Pizza - If your going to order pizza it will take a while but be patient it will come. But when it does the pizza here is lackluster from other deep dish pizza places you can get or if you can even find it somewhere else in Stockton. Their beer on tap are sub par but it's good to know at least they try.  Their appetizer wings are pretty good but the celery that it came with were not fresh but who eats those anyway. The Ahi Poke my wife ordered was good but it only came with one slice of avocado.  When we paid the bill they got 2/3 right for the specials. So to fix the problem it takes an additional 15 minutes to get the check again. I'm probably going to come here again just because I like to prove myself wrong that this place is a dump and they should open something else that has nothing to do with food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Vanessa D.,"Stockton, CA",0,24,2,5.0,2/20/2017,"I went on a Monday night and it was not full so I really enjoyed that, the waiter was delightful and the food was to die for! Their pizza is great and what is even better is that Monday it is half off their pizzas which i came to find out later, i also ordered a white peach margarita that I still can't get out of my mind and their penne shrimp asparagus was soo good i cannot wait to go back and get a plate for myself! It was a good experience and they took a reasonable amount of time to get us our food after ordering it.

Kristin S.,"San Jose, CA",93,59,8,1.0,7/17/2016,"I hadn't been here in over a year and I will likely never return. Last Thursday night I took my 11 year old son out and the waiter named Brandon was overly helpful in the sleaziest most disrespectful and tasteless manner. I felt violated by his constant touching my hand, arm, shoulder and his lame comments about what I should order and how much I should tip him?? Just an awful experience. My son saw everything he did and asked me if he could punch him in the face. I told him no. Violence doesn't solve anything! Pizookie 10 pts, Brandon -10. No woman should ever experience what I did. Simply disgusting!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Alycia D.,"Tracy, CA",93,22,17,1.0,5/19/2017,"The food is mediocre and over priced. The service is pretty awful because it's a bunch of college aged kids half of the time. The place is beautiful and looks fancy but honestly I'd rather eat at a local diner. There are much better places to eat in stockton than in this place. My first time attending BJs my friends and I were celebrating my boyfriends promotion. While in the restaurant my server was an ignorant college aged woman who decided it was appropriate to ask me rudely why I was in a wheelchair. When I stated I was battling cancer she then decided to further question my illness AND ASK ME IF MY HAIR WAS REAL OR A WIG. I was absolutely shocked and extremely upset. When she realized that I was upset she then proceeded to tell me that her grandmother had cancer and tell me I was pretty for having cancer. After this experience I absolutely refuse to ever go to BJs again. I understand that this is one server, but most of the servers there seem rude and ignorant. Fast food workers are more friendlier than these people! On top of that the food is about the same quality as an Applebee's and you're paying twice as much. The food service is slow and it takes so long to get your order. The only benefit of this place is that it's moderately open late, but I'd honestly rather get taco bell or mcdonalds than this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Noel R.,"Lodi, CA",0,4,1,1.0,8/22/2017,There comes a time when you are done giving a place chances based on how good they used to be... today was that day. 6:30pm. We walked in with our children and put our name on the waitlist. We get it. We had children. The servers and host had a side conversation.  Servers didn't want a party with children. They proceeded to seat the next three parties of adults without reservations who came in after us and told us it would be half an hour wait in a restaurant with several empty booths and tables. I was a server once upon a time. What they did was wrong. We walked across the street to Chili's and had an amazing meal and amazing service.

Dax M.,"Stockton, CA",117,70,86,4.0,5/25/2016,"Micro brew in Stockton is a little rare. I know that BJ's is a chain, but their beer is really good. They have a good selection from blonde to stout, even seasonal. I particularly enjoyed the Root of Evil, a smooth IPA mixed with ginger. The ginger pairs surprisingly well with hops and adds a touch of spice to an already wonderful beverage. Perfect for a hot afternoon.  The food is consistently good and they present a wide variety to choose from.  Seasonal appetizers, salads, soups, hamburgers and wraps just to name a few. Ahi salad with fried artichoke hearts was my selection today and it didn't disappoint.  You might try their sparkling wine cocktail for dessert. It comes with a fresh strawberry and a glass rimmed with sugary goodness. Genius!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60

Puka M.,"Galt, CA",27,37,22,3.0,7/19/2017,"Definitely nothing to write home about! BJ;s seem to have lost a step in service and food quality. After a long drive from a few days of wine tasting in Paso Robles, we stopped in at BJ's since they were one of only a handful of places open after 9:00 p.m. Our server was a very nice young man who actually did a nice job taking care of us. It was his assistant that brought the food to the table and both times, when bringing my beer and then my food, I was resting my wrist on the table reading my emails and she nearly slammed each item down right on my hands, thank goodness i was quick to retract them. A subliminal message maybe? Rude at best. The thin crust pizzas we ordered were just ok. Not bad, just not giving you the desire to order them again. It seems that ealier when BJ's first came to town, almost everything they served was delicious! Now it seems like it's just ok. I hope it's just me or the not so nice service of the servers assistant that dampened my taste buds a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=60
Garrett H.,"Orem, UT",10,8,,4.0,1/5/2018,"If you're coming here expecting a BJ, turn around! This place has some great food and serve about anything the heart desires. Their menus are about the same size as Webster's dictionaries and they have them in braille as well so blind people can eat there too.  For dessert, I would recommend a pazookie. It is a delicious fresh baked cookie cake that comes out on a hot platter.  The waitress was nothing to write home about; which is great because I could solely focus on my food and nothing else- No distractions!

Shannon A.,"Hayward, CA",11,102,24,2.0,12/16/2017,"We came here for a work ""holiday "" lunch, it wasn't busy and the server was polite. We all ordered and the food was served within a decent time.  Upon getting our food my co worker noted that her portabella burger was literally cold.. then I took a bite of my black and blue burger, literally raw inside, and to top it off my other co workers burger was raw as well.  The mgr came over and offered soup or salad, which was of course nice, but I honestly think the meals should have been comped. Because upon getting my burger back it was 1 :much smaller  and 2: I'm pretty sure it was like kinda cut up- basically it was real sloppy- but I wasn't going to complain because that's not my style.  With that, they definitely have areas to improve on because it definitely wasn't busy enough to be so ""sloppy "" but like I said the waiter and manager were very polite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton
Paul-James R.,"Stockton, CA",59,1,,4.0,10/19/2017,"Me and my girlfriend come here for dinner many times, mostly for the drinks and the pizookies.   To start off, sometimes the hostess(es) can be a bit hit or miss in terms of being greeted and feeling welcome as we've came in before with them talking to each other with their attention turned away from the entrance; it's not too much of an issue though as we haven't just been completely ignored.  However tonight the hostess was awesome (wish I caught the name on the way out) in both greeting us and also helping us with a server issue we had so just depends on who's working that particular day. Speaking of which, the service can also be a huge hit or a big miss as well depending on who you get.  Just to get straight to the point, I believe that their waiter Miguel should be reevaluated in his customer service as he is the first waiter I've had to both: not tip at all due to poor service and request a new server which I had just done tonight.  Our first time (and really only time) we had him as our server, he was slow and barely visited our table even though he seemed very attentive to other tables around ours.  I've had to bother our runners who brought our food instead for any needs such as just a simple refill of waters, which I hate doing since the runners aren't getting the tip of my check at all under my assumption so why should I bother them and not my actual server.  I wish I could list all the other negatives in his service but it was awhile ago and was lucky enough to not have him for the next few visits afterwards, but his name stuck with me and always comes to mind as to what I should avoid when I visit.   If you want an awesome server though, Kayla and Cara (spellings for both??) are names I try to keep in mind to know when I have a waitress I can count on.  If you get them, leave a generous tip.  James as well was very attentive tonight and I wouldn't mind having him again.  And when the food does get to you, I've no complaints at all.  So yeah, I'll keep coming when I need a beer and have a big appetite; their burgers (like all of them but I wish they still had wedges) and pizzas (California Supreme is the only one I've tried but also kinda hard for me to stray away from) are usually my go-to's with their steaks as well when I feel like paying a bit more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton
Tiffany R.,"Stockton, CA",96,131,344,5.0,9/17/2017,"This is based on my most recent visit to BJ's. I came in on a Friday night and considering how busy it usually is, we called in ahead of time to get our name on the list. We waited less than 5 minutes before we were brought to our table.  Our server was very hospitable, and made us aware of the deals they had going on. For instance, if you sign up and download the BJ's Brewhouse app, you get a free pizookie! It was my sister's birthday dinner the night we went, so we got 2 free pizookies that night! All our food was great. I ordered a 14 oz ribeye steak (cooked medium) and it was perfection! My sister ordered the same thing, but medium well, and unfortunately it was as dry as a well-done steak. One of our entrees took an extra 10 minutes to get to our table, so to apologize for the inconvenience, the manager gave us that entree on the house. Our server was really sweet, as she honored my sister's request to get her free pizookie without the whole birthday singing commotion.

On top of that when we asked for a side that we order she got so mad and slammed a glass on the table cracking it, what really set my table off was that she took her sweet time getting us silverware once our food had already arrived. I watched her talk to the host stand, walking back and forth as if she was taking her time on purpose to get our utensils.

Evai D.,"Stockton, CA",225,12,1,1.0,6/6/2017,"Last night with my Sisters from Hawaii and Missouri, now granted we have lots of eatery but I wanted something where we could all pick different foods. SMH Greeted with a hostess who led us to this small as table for a party of 6 when there were tons of open booths. I don't remember our waitress's name, dont' even remember If she told us smh. Heres what went wrong- from beginning of the dinner to the end. Waitress asked for our drink orders and we gave her our orders but she had this hurry up and order look on her face, strike one I will let that go.  As my sisters and I talked and laughed about our lives and where we are etc... She can back rushing as to hurry up and order SMH strike 2, we ordered our main entrees, but I forgot that I did want some appetizers this bishh has the nerve to have an attitude, so I politely told her if your busy send someone else to take our orders, don't do it... I am not the one. At that point I should have just told my sisters ok this is not the place for us. I hate being rushed with RUDENESS that is unacceptable. There are way too many good eateries with better food, LETS JUST BE REAL. REFILLS - OMG took forever and we had to keep asking for refills, we asked the waitresses for 2 pepsi and 4 sierra mist,  somehow we get 1 pepsi and 2 sierra mist (umm, I guess we'll just share with each other ughhh annyoying) Waitress someone comes back, tells us shes going on her lunch break and that Tim is gonna help us Ok, we thought cool she gone and he was gonna be nicer NOPE he was just as annoying with our damn drinks.  I didn't understand what the damn problem was being that we were really friendly but I noticed all the other tables got his damn attention.   When our food arrived it was cold and bland after waiting so long then we had to keep asking for BBQ sause, extra alfredo sauce the pasta was dry as well, the  fries were as if they were sitting forever smh  AWFUL don't ask for ranch. Actually the bus boys were much more friendy then than the waitress and brought out our request with a smile.  We didn't want dessert but then decided since we hadn't tried the Poozokie lets try it, so we had to  call our waiter back now for his defense he was covering for our wack waitress, but he seemed as if OMG really...  He made a smart remark that almost got me unglued but OMG what a joke they are finally brings it after 15 mints. At this point, we're all pretty tired since it was a late dinner  We decide, okay lets not make a big deal. lets just pay but here it is again she rushing us to pay while we eating our dessert OH HELL NO..she so damn lucky really lucky that I didn't go 51/50 on her because of my sisters here from out of town. THERE WILL BE NO NEXT TIME MY BILL WAS $199 WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY  I don't have a problem paying for good food and good service but that was pathetic for the service we had oh hell no,  NEVER EVER WILL I GO TO THIS PLACE... That just spoiled it for me the waitress is lucky I even bothered to leave her damn tip, that is only because my nephews and daughters all work service jobs and I know its not easy for good folks to leave a decent tip. SO BISSHH you best thank my daughter or else your ass would have gotten the ""HERE is a TIP, GET A BETTER  ATTITUDE TO GET MY DAMN MONEY"" What a waste of money, I should have gone to Red Robin LESSON LEARNED",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton
Marianne E.,"San Diego, CA",553,126,911,4.0,5/25/2016,"We made a reservation for 14 at 6pm on a Wednesday night for a birthday celebration. It took us a while to get our orders together but our servers were very patient and friendly :) I'm usually overwhelmed by the menu at BJ's because it looks more like an adventure novel than a menu. There's too many options! My go to is usually the deep dish pizza :) 2 for $25 is a great deal! You get soup or salad for each person, 1 medium size pizza (we only ate half before we got too full), and a pizookie to share. We got Caesar salads, a medium deep dish Great White pizza (my fave!), and the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. Portions are very generous! It was almost too hard to finish the pizookie after all that food! They let you split the checks individually even in a big group so it makes it easy to pay :) It was my first time at this BJ's location. They have great service, and I think it's perfect for big groups and celebrations. Hope I'll be back again soon for another pizookie!

I have been here in the past many times but its been about 6 or 7 years since then. In the past I had nothing but positive experiences and luckily the service is still the same.  We were greeted right away and sat quickly on a beautiful busy Saturday afternoon. Our server was at our table within a minute or two of sitting down and taking our drink order. Drinks were delivered in a reasonable amount of time. And so was our food. Our server was very attentive, there was one time when she went a little longer than normal between checking on us but it was nothing to be upset about. She did however apologize that it took her a few extra minutes to check on us.  Food and beer were both delicious as usual, I've never had any complaints about the food or beer at any location.

Shirly R.,"Stockton, CA",91,6,,3.0,5/29/2017,"We went to BJ's for a late lunch yesterday afternoon.. we had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table of 7 adults and 1 baby. When we finally got seated, it was next to a fire exit door. It had large, bold letters on the door, it read, ""Do not exit. Alarm will sound"" on it. The little kids seated near us didn't care, they were in and out of those doors. It was very disruptive to our dining experience. You would think the servers would attempt to remind these kids not to go out that door, but no. A female server did the same thing, except she didn't care to slowly close the door, it just slammed closed. It was so interruptive I could barely browse the menu with all the slamming and opening next to our table. Our server was very nice and attentive. At least she brightened my mood a bit. I ordered the Parmesan chicken with mash potatoes and a watermelon mojito. Loved it! Every one appeared pleased with their orders. Even my dad was full and satisfied and he's not the type of person who will order off a menu, he's more of a buffet man. Was the food worth how much we paid for? Not really. I would say it's a little over priced but it was delicious.. Drinks, expected to be pricey. I gave it 3 stars because the Food was good, server was good, but where we sat in location and drinks in price were both a ""no"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton
P L.,"San Francisco, CA",128,16,2,1.0,3/30/2017,"Decided to go to BJ's with a party of 6- 4 adults and 2 kids (birthday dinner) Greeted with a nice friendly host who led us to our table. I don't remember our waitress's name. She had dark brown curly hair. I thought it was great that she asked us if we wanted separate bills, of course we said, ""Yes!"" That way we can avoid the confusion later. But heres what went wrong- from beginning of the dinner to the end. -Asked for 4 waters- somehow only received 3 waters. (umm, I guess I'll share with my boyfriend.) -Ordered patron shots for all the adults. First round- received some crazy ass tequila shots that was NOT PATRON. (that's okay, we won't make a big deal about it. we'll drink it anyways because maybe this cheap liq. will fuggg us up faster??? lets hope!) let's try this again, lets order another round but this time emphasize on the PATRON. Somehow our female waitress disappears and a waiter comes instead and brings us 2 shots. (how does that equate to 2 shots when there's 4 adults?) food comes, that's fine. no complaints there. Since, it was one of our friends birthday. We figured we celebrate with a Poozkie! that's pretty standard, isn't it? Waitress someone comes back, ordered a poozkie with her. I check the time. Okay, 30 mins passed, I know it doesn't take that long for our poozkie to bake. Let me ask another waiter. He finally brings it after 15 mins. At this point, we're all pretty tired since it was a late dinner and the kids are getting fussy. We decide, okay lets not make a big deal. We waved her down for a check. We each get our split bills and WHAT THE HELL DO WE HAVE HERE? Checks are not split, My boyfriend and I (2 adults) somehow have our friend's meals and drinks on our tab. Our friends have (couple with 2 kids) ended up having half of what they ordered on their tab. We ended up paying for what they ordered. Since it was Miri's Birthday we figured it wasn't a big deal.  Okay, long story short. Biggest grip! WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU ASK US IF WE WANT SPLIT CHECKS IF YOU'RE GOING TO JUST CHARGE US WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE AND DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW TO COUNT 2 DRINKS FROM 4 DRINKS?!  I know it's Stockton and the literacy/education rate are low but REALLY? you don't know how to count drinks and follow simple orders? I'M NOT ASKING FOR A SHOT WITH ROCKS ON THE SIDE AND LIMES AND SALT SEPARATELY. IM JUST ASKING FOR 4 FREAKING SHOTS. What a waste of money, I should have bought a bottle from the corner store. I would have been super happy with my drunk self. BUT IM NOT DRUNK BECAUSE I'VE ONLY HAD 2 SHOTS, 1 with terrible cheap house tequila and 1 patron.

Cara H.,"San Ramon, CA",236,8,,2.0,10/14/2017,"We went in on a Friday evening before it started to get busy but we still were waiting 20 minutes to be seated at a table- but then after we were seated we waited another 20 minutes to even meet our waitress. At this point we were already ready to order but the waitress only wanted to take our drink order to start. We insisted we order and she eventually and reluctantly took our order. The drinks arrived, followed by my dinner' side- strange. Then our appetizer arrived. Then we got our dinners. We scarcely saw the waitress. Our waters weren't refilled- only when she brought our bill. We wanted a box for left overs but our waitress never reappeared and had to corner a busboy to help who was also very reluctant to help. We left cash as we had no hope that we would see our waitress again.  This is unfortunate a very typical and not even the worst of service that we have experienced at BJ's. Wrong orders are normalcy, waitresses are often scarce, long waits to be seated receive drinks and food.  The only redeeming quality is that the food is when you finally get it.

AND the manager realized things had gone wrong and actually comped us our pizza. Was also very apologetic. So while there were issues, the staff was aware and worked to make it all right. And the staff was very pleasant. For me that is great. It says their aim is to make things good. I've been to restaurants where things go wrong and nobody seems to care.  I have only one unfixable complaint that seems to be common to all BJ outlets. We were seated at a booth. BJ booths all seem designed with less space between the seats and the tables than other chain restaurants. If you're thin it's annoying but okay. If you have any body fat though you will end up squeezing in. Then you can either embarrass yourself by having to ask to be moved or you can sit squished for your whole meal feeling bad about yourself. I'm guessing the design is intended to allow more booths and more seating.

I repeatedly told the front person we have 12 people but they still put 2 tables together with 10 chairs. Our waitress was Jessica and she was friendly and attentive. She bought my niece her first birthday shot then we got our drinks and appetizers. I always like their appetizers. My fav were the wrapped avocado and artichoke dip. There were no small plates for the appetizers even though I asked for them. I ordered grilled chicken with veggies over rice pilaf. The rice was super salty so I couldn't eat my food. Everyone else had pasta and ribs so they ate theirs. The alcohol mixed drinks barely had any alcohols in them so it was disappointing. They were supposed to bring out the pizookie after we paid but they never did. Jessica said to go back next time and remind them. I don't know if we'll ever go back though.

They are either accepting feedback from customers on the food and making a shift toward the better, or they got rid of the cook messing this dish up.

That might be due to us having 10 people and they were busy.  Other than the reservation snafu and waiting on the food our experience and the food was decent.  Marissa claimed she would talk to Lisa about communicating the reservation protocol.  I hope that happens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=40

The only people who should keep their jobs is the host with the bangs and then also the bus boy who gave us our waters after 20 minutes of waiting.  First off hosts the one with curly hair and the one with a tight pony tail-awful. You'll see them faces pinched. With no smile. My friend and I walked up to the counter, without a hello or a welcome they just looked up at us once maybe-and went back to whatever they were doing. My friend had to get their attention to get seats. And then bangs swooped in and took us to our seats-you know actually doing her job. Then our waitress comes and she is anything but pleasant. Completely sarcastic(no she didn't get tip and neither did her braided teammate who just ruined dessert.) Okay we ordered are meal and the whole time I never got a water refill was never asked-my bad, but finally I asked for water and a pazooki...20 min pass. My friend looks around, the waiters and waitresses are not taking any hints-until boom bus boy swoops in and gets us the water himself! (You know DOING OTHER PEOPLES JOBS)  15 minutes later, some other waitress-I don't know who she is-has our pazookis in bags to go. No girl-we didn't say to go. Sent her all the way back to the kitchen. and then waited another 10 min...15...20...? And our original waitress comes back with our receipt telling us there has been a mistake and that we were put up the list in priority so our pazooki's would be out soon...15 min later...we're done. Outta here. How dare you make us wait practically an hour for dessert and make us pay for it. Never eating here again. Unless they change up the staff.

The two were enough to feed four people and the price came out pretty reasonable.  I brought my mother last night, and we had a great time. Our server, Derek, was fantastic. He was very attentive and came by to check on us regularly. He was very patient when we couldn't decide what we wanted and asked him to come back in 5 minutes.  There were some young looking servers at an empty table slamming menus down on the table. I was literally jumping in my seat from the loud noise because it kept scaring me.

I've always had good service from the waiters, waitresses, bartenders and hostesses but the food and drinks just have never wowed me. I think the best thing on the menu is the pizza and even then there's been a few times that I've gotten soggy greasy crust (while it was still really flavorful and tasty just SUPER greasy).   I've had burgers, salads, soups and of course pizza but none of it stands out as a ""we have to go to BJ's and get ???"" dish. Maybe the pizookies are their calling card but even then it's just a fresh cookie with ice cream.  I've also tried many of their beers, while I appreciate that they brew their own special blends I'm still waiting for the beer that I have to tag on untappd as a 5 star brew.

Me and a group of friends were pretty hungry and wanted to see the final game of Copa America which this place is pretty convenient for both of those. We came in and we were accommodated with a table that can fit 8. We ordered our food and watched the game.  As we were watching the game, A lady passed by our table and fell pretty badly. She couldn't get up and was really in pain. We came by to help her up and to sit her down. What was really surprising though was the lack of attention of the workers around the area. There was 3 waiters by one of the register within eye view of what just happened and not a single one noticed it. The table next to the register had to yell at them in order to get their attention. By then, the manager came by and attended her and asked if she needed anything. He then asked around to see what happened and I guess by then things got sorted out. Hopefully that fall wasn't too bad. I think she just tripped on herself since the floor wasn't wet or anything, plus she was wearing these high wedges shoes.  Food finally came in and I had the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne to which was pretty good. Felt light and didn't came off a strong either. The one thing I really do like about BJs is their Pizookies. I'm not a desert kind of guy but this is my exemption. Sooo goood! Overall experience here, its ok. I feel like the people working here should be more aware of whats going on around them so that when incidents like this comes along, they would be faster in responding.

We waited 35 min. 1st plate was done correctly medium well. 2nd was burnt and dry supposed to be medium well with fried jalapeños. They were raw. 3rd was supposed to be medium it was also well done. We did not see our server so we flagged someone else who when we explained the issue he actually asked ""So, do you want to send it back?"" Well, duh. We watched our daughter eat her food, and waited and waited. Finally our server checked on us and we explained the issue and she said she would check. It's now been another 35 mins and still no food. Daughter is done and we have not had our beverages refilled. 40 mins and our corrected orders arrive, well kinda. My burger cooked but still no fried jalapeño. That was an easy fix tho. My husbands burger was I swear mooing. Looked like they grabbed a handful of meat, tossed it on the grill for 30 seconds and flip and serve. He ate it...much to my chagrin but after well over an hour we were both hungry. By the way anyone who doesn't know B.J.s no longer serves shoestring cut fries although they are pictured on the menu.

I took my family out to eat expecially for my mom for Mother's Day. At first our server Miranda took our order and then later she said her time was up and she had to leave and left us with Victoria and then with Kristen. They kept switching servers that at the end I didn't even know who was our server. So we get our food by Kristen and then she leaves and we start eating and then we all need sauces for our steaks and fries, and we call Victoria over and ask for all the sauces we need and she says okay I'll get that for you . Then 10 minutes of eating we ask Victoria again about the sauces, we are already half done with our food and it's getting cold, and she says oh the other server is getting that for you ! And I said okay. Still staying a bit calm because I notice they are a bit busy. But then I realized there was no other server who we told about the sauces, she was the only one unless she told someone else and they didn't bring it. So I'm getting really upset because now we all can't even eat our food because we are waiting for sauces and it's getting cold and we are running out of drinks. So we are trying to at least eat while it's still warm without sauces but also mad that Victoria said the other server was getting them and she couldn't get them for us, and all she was doing was talking and on her tablet walking around doing nothing! Like getting sauces should not take that long! So then Kristen comes to our table and asks if we need anything and we say yes! We need sauces and refills , we already asked two times and we can't even eat until we get sauces and refills, our food is getting cold. So she says I'm sorry about that I will personally bring that for you. So then she quickly got that for us and asked if we needed anything else. We at least enjoyed about a quarter of our food with sauce at the end but it was already cold and we were already full! So I think Victoria needs more training on serving than socializing for too long. I was not going to leave a tip at all , until Kristen helped us although it was a little too late we still did because of her willingness to help and make it right with her excellent customer service. I am very disappointed with my experience at BJ's expecially because it's a nice restaurant and a bit expensive , it was our first time here too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=80

I used to order that pot roast sandwich but they discontinued it. Pizookies are always a nice treat after dinner! We always resort to coming here cuz it has large areas for big groups and they're open late. Thing is the service is kinda slow and the waitors and waitresses seem unwelcoming and rude.

Rootee A.,"Sacramento, CA",189,54,474,1.0,2/28/2016,"So I'm going to go straight to the point. I SPECIFICALLY ordered a chicken Sandwich with NO BACON. I get my sandwich, take a bite and decide to take the tomatoes out when I notice Little ITS and pieces of bacon on my avocado. Vividly you could tell they placed the Bacon and then decided to remove it.  I truly was upset because it's forbidden for me to eat bacon and for me to have to experience something that could have been prevented made me feel disrespected. Mistakes are made and can be fixed....appropriately! They could have easily just made me a new sandwich but for them to just brush it off like it's not a big deal was rude. To top it off they were not even busy, in which I don't even want to imagine what happens back there when they are busy.  So then here comes Andrew "" the manager"". He asked us "" oh is everything ok"" .. Hmm no that's why you are here? I'm thinking!!By the way he's not even standing straight or being professional he's leaning on the booth next to us, like he knows us! From what recall even a waiter takes your order standing straight up.Andrew does apologize and asks if we would like anything (later on it was a free dessert they were offering) hmm NO! No one wants a dessert, we came here for food and drinks!  In conclusion, at least I ask for my 2 mojitos to be on the house, since I longer wanted to eat! They stated I couldn't get that for free, but at least they were not charging me for my sandwich and they offered a free dessert! .. Hmm excuse me? I better not pay for a sandwich that was made incorrectly! .. At this point I was so upset I just took care of my tab and decided to never come here again; including my cousins. Should I give them credit for not charging me for the cheese sticks? ....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=80

Now you expect these kind of things from a Denny's or ihop but even they have stepped up their performance from what they use to be. Sadly I can't say the same about this place.

After sitting at a table without being acknowledged again for over 10 MINUTES and plenty of staff, and my wife's meal STILL wrong, I can not fault the waiters, but I DO hold management fully responsible for the decline of what was once a great place to go and enjoy a meal.

Ordered a Skinny margarita and Watermelon Basil margarita while we waited for our third person to show up. The first Skinny was great but the Watermelon Basil was PURE syrup. Made my stomach ache after one swig (ended up ordering a second Skinny one halfway through the meal and that one was on par with the Watermelon Basil). Received a little attitude from the server when we asked to replace the the Watermelon Basil with a Jameson and Ginger Ale, but felt justified when we over heard the waiter tell the manager that we wanted to send it back and the manager said ""Yeah, that looks really dark"".  Ordered the Ahi Poke for our appetizer and it was good. Ended up getting 2 Ahi Salad entrées and we were disappointed that the Ahi on the Poke appetizer was MUCH better than the Ahi on the salads. The Salad Ahi was slivered, stringy, pieces with goopy breading. The other entrée we ordered was the Lunch Special half flatbread/half salad. The Chicken Club flatbread was ""just okay"" and the salad was an optionless, plain, mediocre (""at best"") side. Yelp has a coupon that gives you buy one, get one entrée free from 11-3 which is restricted to one per table even if requesting separate checks. No biggie, but the roommate and I each have a manly man that were requesting grub so it was a slight disappointment. Probably won't return unless we're just coming for drinks.

Gabrielle Andrea Mullen C.,"Stockton, CA",221,9,3,1.0,8/11/2016,"I only come to the BJ's in Stockton when I feel like having a pizookie. Their pizookies are so delicious, and so worth my $7! Unfortunately, I'd still have to rate this location 1 star since their customer service is so poor. I love going out to eat with my fiance on Friday nights, and I wish that this BJs location was as good as other locations that I've been to. After a long week, I enjoy going out to dinner on Friday nights, but I don't intend to spend 35-40+ minutes for waiting on my food. I think I have been to this location about 3-4 times since we moved here about a year ago. I think the first time we went here, we waited about 20 minutes just for a server to greet us at our table, and that was after I stared people down, lol. I just didn't know who to ask. The other servers didn't want to make eye contact, or they were too busy with the tables they were serving. I don't blame them, but we sat there wondering what we should do. I even asked myself if they forgot about us! If I am desperate and craving a pizookie, I'll come here. Their prices here would be worth it if their service matched it. But spending like $60 on a dinner for two (for entrees, drinks, and a pizookie) isn't worth it to me if we gotta wait 20 minutes to be greeted after sitting down + another 35-40 minutes to get our dinner before our appetizers, plus another 25 minutes to get dessert, and another 20 after that to get the check. Not to mention last time, they brought us our appetizers halfway through our food. I also like to have my pasta with tobasco. It's simple, I know. But my point is that I didn't see my server until maybe 20 minutes after my food was served by someone else. When I needed something, my server wasn't around to ask. I gave up, and asked someone else. Honestly, I'm a pretty patient person. And it was just a shame that neither of our encounters there did we have servers that told us what was going on. I know they're busy, but each time, we probably only saw our server when we ordered, and after the food came because someone else served it to us. It would have just been nice to at least have someone just tell us one time out of our 3-4 long encounters, ""Your food will be out shortly."" Unfortunately, I'll probably still be back because I love their pizookies. 5 stars for their food & the greeters at the front!

Manice T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,9,1,3.0,3/31/2015,"We'd argue that the selection and food execution at most BJ's is strong.  Some clear strengths for this and all BJs would be in food variety, savory items, and courteous servers.  The challenges would be in this BJs' handling of long wait lines and managing customer time at tables.  Overall, it's solid. The following categorical scores are all out of 5; when combining them (weighing taste more heavily), they explain our overall Yelp rating. TASTE: 3.5 Like a good set of tires, their food is reliably good but nothing you should dream about, unless you're a weirdo.  The pizza, burgers, and calamari are items we've tried and have found to be solid.  The pizza is Chicago-style, but not overly heavy.  The burgers are thick and well-sauced; you have multiple bun options. SERVICE: 3 The servers are always pleasant if not energetic.  They don't take reservations and leave something to be desired in time management.  Expect long ques that, during peak times, can be unmitigated disasters. EXPERIENCE/AMBIANCE: 4 The general vibe is fun and relaxed.  The game is on, minus the overly zealous (drunk) fans. VALUE:  3 The prices are basically fair; no steals and only a few rip-offs. TOTAL SCORE: 3.4 RECOMMENDATION Avoid BJ's at peak times on Friday or Saturday.  Instead, come during the week or on Sunday for lunch.

Isabelle C.,"Stockton, CA",23,47,32,1.0,7/21/2015,"This place sucks. Yet I still came here too often -_- the only time I do come here is when my friends do their bday dinners here or friends wants to meet there for lunch, whatever. The only thing I ever get here is skinny-cut fries and appetizers. Everything else tastes like microwaved foods. The last time I was here, about a week ago, my friend was visiting on military leave. So a bunch of us girls got together...here. At first, everything was good, our server was nice and we liked her. She took our orders, and that was the last time we saw her. Without notice, we apparently got another waitress. The second waitress brought out our food, she was nice too until she barely even checked up on us. We had to flag her down for refills, and refills took long. When we paid, this server literally took 30 MINUTES to process our payments. Apparently she had charged the wrong card to the wrong items, when we specifically wrote on the check which belong to who. It wasn't even busy. It was a friggin' Tuesday night at 8. What we were more annoyed about was the fact that our server didn't tell us there was a problem as soon as it happened, she just took our payments and disappeared for thirty minutes. A couple years ago, my friend and I came here on New Year's Eve at about 11:15pm and were sat quickly. It was busy but seemed like most of the tables had their food already. A couple of big parties. Regardless, my friend and I sat at our table for 40 minutes without having a server serve us. We flagged two different workers after 10 min and the second after 25 mins to let them know we're ready and they said ""I'm sorry for the wait, let me go get your server"" and no one ever came. This totally killed my NYE. SO STUPID. We just got up and left at 11:55pm. I should have complained to management but I didn't want to deal w/ it anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=200
Lolita B.,"Oakland, CA",65,10,5,1.0,10/26/2015,"Definitely something new going on. New management or a new chef but the food has absolutely changed. My daughters pizza tasted like it was baked on greasy focaccia but my Alfredo tasted really fresh as to where you could actually see the butter and cheese separating on the noodles which were rather dry though I asked for extra sauce with the initial order. However, the chicken was grilled really nicely. Oh and my chedder broccoli soup was less than what I'm used to. It's sourdough bowl was viciously burned and had barely been hollowed out. As to where as soon as I removed its lid for inspection the waitor instantly offered to bring additional soup. The best part was the wait staff. Their service was superior.

I ordered a custom deep dish pizza with artichokes, garlic and tomatoes.  A random waiter came up to our table and gave us a the wrong pizza.  When our assigned waitress came to check on us, she realized right away that it wasn't the right pizza.  The manager went to our table and apologized for the error.  We got our pizza eventually, which still lacked tomatoes, but it really didn't matter to me at this point.  It was the kitchen that messed up anyway and not the waitress.  She was super friendly. What I really love is the avocado egg rolls and the pizookies!  I'll always order those two things when I go to BJ's.  Otherwise, the rest of the entree selection isn't appetizing to me..

Cory N.,"Stockton, CA",625,33,46,4.0,4/26/2014,"I'm definitely a huge fan of their pizza. From the bacon cheeseburger (discontinued?) to the buffalo chicken, I've made a silent promise to myself to only order their deep-dish whenever I go there with friends. As for service, some of the staff are more incompetent than others, and as the saying goes, ""You're only as strong as your weakest link"". In no way does a night of inconsistent service depict the strength of the BJs staff as a whole. However, there is still a chance that you will feel unwelcome if you decide to enjoy a meal on the BJs off Pacific Avenue. In conclusion, great pizza; inconsistent service.

Rene R.,"Stockton, CA",3,25,,1.0,10/25/2015,"This was the crappiest service we have had in a long long time.  Food was ok. We ordered three appetizers: the calamari, chicken wings, and stuffed mushrooms. We also ordered the burger for my son. We would have ordered more but the appetizers took so long to get to the table that we figured we were spending enough. Mushrooms were ok; they were stuffed with spinach with pesto cream sauce drizzle.  I liked the pesto flavor.  Calamari was a little overdone--the marinara sauce was flavorless, but the white dipping sauce was good and garlicky.  Chicken wings were done as expected. My son had the brewhouse burger.  He said it was good. The problem was mostly with the service. We ordered drinks and appetizers at the same time. We got nothing for the longest time. My mom was coughing and we had to ask another wait person for just some water. And still we waited!!! Rude!!!!!!!!  Then our waitress approached the table and said she was sorry but she was really busy with a large party at another table.  My mother said we would like a different waitress then.  We still had no drinks or appetizers.   The second waitress came soon after and took our entire order again.  That is when I added the burger to the order because my son was hungry.  Then we waited some more for our beverages. Finally the iced tea came but my son's cream soda had not come. The cream soda finally came. Then his burger came right afterward--before the appetizers!!!!  They were busy. It was a Sunday afternoon.  But you would think they would prepared for it.

We only ordered when she came to our table and with 5 people sharing one pazookie she rolled her eyes once again because we asked for 5 spoons. Shoot me right?

I've only been disappointed with the service once and that was when I was in a party of 10. The waitress got some of the orders wrong, and when she came out with the right orders, she handed them out to the wrong people -.-  Also, if you're a student at UOP, you can use your Pacific Cash here!

Sherri S.,"Stockton, CA",4,10,2,5.0,3/30/2016,"I brought my family (husband and grown sons + girlfriend) here for my birthday 3/25 for a few reasons - I love the twisted BLT salad(without feta), the cherry chipotle glazed salmon and the beignet with strawberries.  They were all fantastic, just as I'd hoped they'd be! My husband likes the pizza, recently changing to the Tavern Cut thin crust Market Tavern Pizza. He's ordered this twice now, this time without the peppers(pretty spicy); I love the crispness of the crust.   One of my sons had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was delicious, his gf had a burger (she let me steal a couple of fries), but the burger was cooked perfectly and looked juice and really good!  Another son had the jambalaya. I didn't try the jambalaya, but it looked wonderful and my son ate the whole thing so it must've been good!(he's my picky son.)  My last son had the clam chowder bread bowl which was very filling. The top of the clam chowder bowl was buttered and grilled like crispy garlic bread - it was very tasty!  Of course we received the free pazooki - which my husband ate all of and enjoyed every bite! I ordered the monkey bread pazooki to taste and so I wouldn't be eating my beignet alone! The monkey bread pazooki was fabulous! A cinnamon roll flavored pull apart bread with vanilla bean ice cream, of course everyone had a bite and wanted more! But my favorite is the beignet! I wanted to eat every bite, but thought I'd better share. We couldn't decide which we liked better, the monkey bread pazooki or the beignet!  The waiter was fun & patient, he put up with us keeping him waiting when trying to take our order! He kept my iced tea refilled as well as refilling sodas & root beers without being asked!

Casey A.,"Lodi, CA",3,54,17,3.0,9/20/2015,"My family and I enjoy the 2 for $25.00 meal (pizza, salad & pizookie). We come here quite often when that deal is being offered. This is the closest to our house so we typically go to this location. We had a pretty bad experience that last time we were here. So bad that the Manager sent us a $10.00 gift card to use at another time. Since the deal is being offered again, we thought we would give it another shot.  We went for dinner last Saturday. We arrived early (around 4:30pm). We were seated fairly quickly since they weren't that busy but then everything went downhill from there. Since we knew what we were having, we ordered right away. We actually upgraded our pizza to a large (for $3.00 more) and added a side salad for our son. About 45 minutes went by and then our pizza finally arrived. The only issue, we never received our salads. Our waitress never came back to check on us. The person that delivered our pizza said they would check on our salads. A few minutes went by and out came our salads and then our waitress came by to say that she was sorry that no one ever brought them out. A few minutes after that the Manager came over to apologize for the delay.  I was shocked to say the least at what the Manager had to say. He apologized for the delay and then proceeded to tell us that he could not remove the price of the salads from our bill since it was part of the $25.00 deal. First of all, we never asked to speak to a Manager. Secondly, we never asked for anything to be removed from our bill. That is not in our nature. And lastly, we did order an extra side salad and I had a soda so if he really wanted to remove something from our bill, he could have removed either one of those items. For the three of us to eat a pizza and salad, we were there for almost 2 hours. I am sorry but they did not have any large parties when we arrived so I could not understand why it took so long. I did overhear another waiter telling the table next to us that they were short-staffed and that several of the waiters were picking up extra tables to help out.

As for their other food items, they have their share of pretty good dishes, but it's not like their stuff is anything special. It's just alright food.  The atmosphere is definitely great if you want to go out for a special night. The ambiance is cool and hip, if you know what I mean.

I love their Chicken Pot Stickers and Chicken Lettuce Wraps. I order Classic Breakfast Sandwich. Since I love Bacon, I choose instead of ham or sausage. The sourdough bread was perfect. It is served with yummy seasoned country potatoes.  The service was great. Our server was so helpful! One of the best experience. He went out of his way to assist us.  Great environment!!

This is where my fiancé & I had our first dates before we got engaged, back when we were just friends, meeting for dinner & drinks. We moved away, but recently came back to visit & have dinner where it all started. Tonight, just had amazing customer service from Kali. She recommended the portobello strips, which we had with drinks. They came out promptly and she checked up on us frequently to ensure everything was tasting great. I highly recommend you try these portobello strips with the amazing garlic aioli. I ordered the Balsamic Chicken and my fiancé had the Roast Beef Dip sandwich. It was amazing. What made it great was the service. Seriously, sit at any of Kali tables & you'll be well taken care of. She's an amazing server. We've eaten at other BJ's establishments, but her service is worth this 5 star review. I thanked her personally, because even though she was busy, she took the time to make sure our dinner was going well, but she definitely deserves this praise.

Always! How hard is to get water.... I had to remind the waitress several times, and not once was I offered a refill. I know a guy that used to work here, and asked how it was.

It was incredibly disgusting. We attempted to get the attention of several employees, with no luck until finally someone came to our table. She apologized, as well as a young man did too. They claimed the manager would come by and speak to us. Did he ever make his way to our table? Of course not. We waited the whole time and never once did he/she come by.

We really enjoyed the food and service again!  James kept bringing more clam chowder and different salads that I kept ordering. We also noticed the stars he was wearing on his collar.

Marlene T.,"Florence, KY",213,227,2241,2.0,2/6/2014,"Ehem, let me state first I am not usually a purveyor of chain restaurants. My friends decided to pick me up so we could all get to the restaurant together and I was staying nearby visiting and the closest. Bad mistake. I should have got there first (1) because the wait for tables is often long (as I observed through our whole visit). And (2) you can't get the happy hour prices unless you sit at the bar area. Which is apparently, always full. When we showed up we were actually seated fairly quickly, which appeared to be a fluke from when we showed up. There were waves of people I saw going in before us, and waves after us. Regardless, I was happy at least about that. We each ordered a beer and decided on a few appetizers as we all just wanted some munchies to share while we chatted. They did bring me a happy hour menu at my request and I could see that we were literally paying double for everything we ordered since we were not in the bar area. I inquired if it was possible to get happy hour prices and was politely informed ""We use different registers on the floor. They aren't programmed to allow us to change the prices even if we wanted to"". I somehow have a hard time believing that they were inept at asking management to comp meals or give discounts. They just weren't probably allowed with this case. Hmm, so this translates to a larger tip for the server and more money for the restaurant and more out of our pockets. Had I not been visiting with friends I would have walked out across the parking lot and headed to Boudin's. The beer was pretty standard issue. The food was decent pub like food. We ordered the margarita flat bread pizza, the boneless wings in spicy sauce, and the calamari. This was enough to feed three people adequately. I read on the menu that the flat bread pizza was 90 calories for each slice and came with 8 slices. Had I been by myself and only ordered that I could have eaten the whole thing. It wasn't filling, the toppings were slopped on without care (the end pieces had no toppings - we used the sauce from the calamari), and it was more like a cracker than a flat bread. I still like crackers so it worked but I was worried I was shoveling calories down my throat and wondered what the heck I was getting out of it. Still, I'll be the first to admit - if you go out to eat, you generally toss the calorie concern out the window. The boneless wings, or glorified chicken chunks were good. The buffalo style sauce was really, really, really salty. I think I would ask for that sauce on the side if we order it again. The blue cheese sauce had a mild hint of blue cheese but as one in my party said ""It might as well be ranch"". The chicken was juicy and well, was chicken. The calamari we ordered with tomato marinara as one in our party we consider allergic to garlic since he is so hypersensitive to it. They were fine with subbing sauce, though he said it wouldn't bother him if we wanted the garlic aioli. I'm not much into mayo so we were all happy to get marinara.  I found a piece of carrot in the boneless wings, which was nummy. And another in our party found a french fry in the calamari. He liked it, but neither was supposed to be in each of those dishes. All in all the food was just so-so, the average for chain restaurants. The beer okay, nothing special. The service was good and prompt and polite. I'm just still horribly offended about the happy hour policy since I've never run into this anywhere else I've eaten. I'm sure it exists at other places, and apologies to be harsh as this is the first place to pop my happy hour expecting bubble. I can't say I'd go out of my way to eat here. I'd probably head over to Applebee's in all honesty for the same quality food, brand name beer I love, and cheaper prices. Oh and the reason it gets knocked down to two stars from an average meh three ... no wifi! Everyone has guest or at the least hot spot wifi in highly commercial restaurant areas. Get with the program! How are we supposed to check into Yelp? Oh right, they're so cheap they want us to use our own bandwidth. Or maybe they don't want us to rate them on Yelp ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=140

Food: it's not actuality fine dining, although sone items are pricey, you just need to be pay extra attention on your orders. Part of our huge HEFFA status order was fried avocado rolls. The lighting of the place could trick you so check if they are fresh and color of avocados didn't change yet, avocados tends to turn grayish/black when they been sitting. To make this short, that's what happened to our order,  so after i tried a whole piece, we asked our server to give us a fresher one which he did right away. That bumped their 3 stars to 4.

Just don't be shy to say something or ask them if you need anything,  if they had allot of strikes, don't hold back and tell them, you might get a free Pozoki (that warn cookie with ice cream that smart good looking people can't spell).

I always usually get the chicken alfredo and it's good, but not great.  Their pizookie, however, is a saving grace. I always get the salted caramel and it is SO good. The cookie is always warm and the vanilla ice cream is so good with it. I will sometimes just get the little mini trios, because I want to try different flavors, but honestly, the salted caramel is my go to. It's delicious and veryyyyy fattening.

Danielle J.,"Stockton, CA",24,111,28,3.0,2/7/2014,"2/7/14-We came to BJ's to celebrate my nephews 21st b-day.  The appetizers were awesome, especially the avocado rolls.  We all ordered different burgers.  However, my nieces burger was burned and they could not bring it with the rest of our food.  By the time the burger came we were through eating.  They gave us the bill, and to our surprise they didn't try to give her a percentage of the burnt burger off,  or offer her a dessert, we had to call them on it.  Service was mediocre and the place was busy for a Thursday night. The thick fries that they offer with the burgers were terrible--no taste.  They even bought an empty bottle of ketchup to our table.  What were we suppose to do with that?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=280
Jeffrey S.,"San Leandro, CA",329,445,250,3.0,5/22/2011,"If you like watching sports and drinking beer, BJ's is a place for you.  If you like American food at a good value, BJ's is also a place for you.  But if you like freshly baked cookies with ice cream on top, then BJ's is REALLY the place for you. I went to the Stockton BJ's with my wife and in-laws last week for lunch.  It was busy, but not full, so we were seated right away.  Since BJ's is a big-box restaurant (like Cheesecake Factory or Applebees), this location looked identical to any other BJ's I've dined in before.  We ordered the Best Beginnings appetizer sampler, and I chose the Blonde Shrimp entrée .   The appetizers plate came with 2 types of egg rolls, the spinach and artichoke dip, and some mozzarella sticks.  They were good, but not exceptional.  My entrée consisted of breaded & deep-fried shrimp served with French fries and coleslaw.  The slaw and fries were OK, but the shrimp were good, especially with their tarter and cocktail sauces.   The rest of my party enjoyed their food, though my wife and mother-in-law needed to go boxes for their dishes.  Since I knew we weren't staying for dessert, I ate all my food. But if you come to BJ's, I recommend having one of their famous Pizookies for dessert.  It's a freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream.  They come in several flavors, or you can get the Sampler of 3 different flavors.  You can get one to share with a friend, or be a big like me and eat one by yourself!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=280

Jen B.,"Lodi, CA",0,39,,1.0,3/27/2013,"Alright.. I give up. I've been faithful to this place since it opened and continue to take people there and frequent the place despite hit and miss food and service that ranges from being rushed, being ignored and having a great time.  Tonight, my food was not good. The server who I really like, up sold my boyfriend on the pizza, salads and pizookie deal, although it wasn't that great of a deal for us and I had already ordered my own food. Our drinks took forever, salad came about 5 minutes before the food did. Salad contained brown pieces of lettuce but was good otherwise, pizza and pasta were skimpy on sauces and toppings and about 30% of my pasta had no sauce, with large, still uncooked broccoli mixed in.  Bad food nights happen, I understand.. however when we were done eating, it was another 40 minutes before our pizookie arrived. A male manager showed up with it and said ""here it is, sorry."" and left. Our server indicated that the pizookie was supposed to be comp'd due to the awful wait times, but then didn't do anything to have the price of the meal adjusted. We had to ask for our check three times, it took another 20 minutes for the check to arrive, and another 15 or so for someone else to take my money.  In this time, I asked the hostess to speak with a manager. I kindly explained how we had been there for nearly 2 hours and how bad our experience was, and all she did was stare at me blankly, ask where we were seated, and brought me free pizookie coupons. You know, for the amount of money I spend here, and the nearly 2 hour time we'd been there that should've only been 40-45mins, I would've liked to have been offered a reduction in my bill (no alcohol) if not even a free meal.  I couldn't take my leftovers home, as they'd been sitting on the table for over an hour and I didn't want to chance getting sick from food being out too long at the wrong temperature. Again, no offer from BJs staff to fix the situation. Thanks for the pizookie coupons.. I'm sure someone at work will love them. I won't be back to this location again as this is my last straw with this place. Too many times has my service been bad, my food cold or undercooked, or my $8 cocktails taste like they forgot the alcohol. I'm tired of paying $45 to have my time wasted and being disappointed when I was expecting a decent meal out.  It's a shame.. I used to love this place.

Dixie x.,"Fresno, CA",5,32,11,2.0,9/17/2014,"my husband and I came to this location tonight for dinner. we were seated right away. no wait time is awesome.  our waitress came and took our drink and appetizer order as we were not ready for our main course yet. it was a very long wait just to get the spinach and artichoke dip, and it was disgusting. the dip was way too fluffy, I like mines thick and cheesey. this one looks like it was just whipped. the chips were also so thick. there were even a whole stack of them fried together in one piece. I did not enjoy it at all and asked for a salsa dip.  After that, our order was finally taken and the wait time for that was probably another 30 mins. We've ordered the shrimp scampi pasta, the pork chops plate, and stuffed mushrooms. along with one of their berry maple brew and the white peach margarita.  the margarita was so strong, I didnt even finish it. not that its a bad thing, lol. my husband's brew was good in his opinion. the stuffed mushrooms were amazing. taste and flavors were perfection! my husband had the pork chops and was so disappointed. it came with a side of green beans and mashed potatoes. everything was great expect for the pork chops. it was so damn dry, it tasted like paper. we were so disappointed.  the shrimp scampi was amazeball!!! Perfect portion, sauce, etc. but there was one thing, there was something that looked like the skin of an avocado in the pasta. because of that, I no longer ate. and with the long wait on everything and as irritated as we were, we dropped it and left. we wont be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=280

Katie B.,"Stockton, CA",65,54,52,4.0,7/27/2014,"I love going to BJ's at night, in a ""let's not go to a real bar let's go to BJs instead because it's way better than Applebee's or Chili's"" type of mood. My friend and I used to go just about every other night during football season (seriously) because of the happy hour specials, and we made friends with a lot of the workers in the bar. Elaine is hands down my favorite bartender ever, and Kayla, Scott (who I don't think works there anymore), and Stephanie are my favorite servers of all time. Shoutout to Sunshine, too, who I've only had serve us a few times but she's always nice! The service in the bar gets a 10 out of 10 whenever those lovely people are working! I'd give service in the bar without them a 7.5, and service in the actual dining room a 6.5. It's not that the others aren't nice and accommodating whenever they see you, it's just that the orders usually take awhile and the drinks sometimes go unfilled.  I feel like the food is always hit or miss, with the exception of the Pizookie which is always fabulous. The beer and drinks are great, and usually I like to get pizza or fries to accompany them. My pizzas are either perfect or overcooked, which is frustrating. I love their pizza when it's perfect, and it's usually when I'm craving it the most that it's not. It's not even that it's a matter of too much sauce or picky stuff like that, it's just simply overcooked or undercooked. And I'm not one of those people who sends their food back when it's overcooked, because I worked at a pizza parlor and know how that can mess up the line, but it never hurts to just mention it. The crispy fries are my second favorite, with ranch of course, but even those sometimes come out a little lukewarm. Haven't had a bad experience with the spinach and artichoke dip yet, love the chips and that they'll bring you more if you ask.  Overall, I recommend sitting in the bar because the service is quicker and more attentive over there. The food isn't bad, the beer is refreshing, and the ambiance is nice.

The young waitress was nice enough and took my order, even suggesting an up sale of appetizers. I ordered #166 Crispy Jalapeño Hamburger substituted with bison in stead of cow. I requested a medium rare with a Cesar salad and thin fries. I ordered a cider which was pretty good and refreshing. But $6.75 for a small thin glass. Are you kidding me? Wow! What a rip off.  Anyways, I digress, the salad shows up weak looking with lack of any real flavor or dressing. Pretty basic stuff here folks! When the bison burger arrives, it was not medium rare but instead served rare. What a sloppy ass burger, there is absolutely no love in making their food by BJ's. Bring in McDonalds or Burger King cooks because you must be using the dishwasher. Literally, must be using the dishwasher to cook the burger. Yuck! So, I ordered a new burger, all the same request as prior. Chipotle mayonnaise and Baja sauce. Paid the $23 dollar bill and even tipped the waitress 20%. Went home with the new burger and placed it on the table. I placed it on a table and took an hour nap. Waking up feeling like the time to eat is now. When I open the to go box the bison jalapeño burger is without any of the previously mentioned condiments. Just warm lettuce. Suck fest! I'm so disappointed in BJ's. What the heck has happened to your establishment? Hope it is just a bad day.

We ordered the avocado rolls that were super delicious! We also ordered the California club flat bread pizza, boneless wings, a side of fries, and ribs. I didn't think anything special of our order. The boneless wings tasted like something you could just pop in the oven at home with sauce drizzled over it. The flat bread pizza was also mediocre. We told them it was my brother's birthday & they brought out a complimentary brownie ice cream cake with a candle. I think the waiter asked if we wanted them to sing to us but we politely refused and they were okay with it.

And waited 20 min after everyone got there food and when I got my salad it was like soup. And the chicken was hard and looked like charcoal. My one year old got spaghetti and it was nothing but noodles with a table spoon of sauce she loves spaghetti and she spit it out. My boyfriend got a really nice ribeye just kinda burnt. But the baked potato was pink and black on the inside. And he ordered grilled asparagus and it was chopped up into little half inch pieces. Nothing like the picture showed.

I had the calamari and shrimp lettuce wraps as appetizers and selected Cajun Pasta with Shrimp as my entrée and my Mom had their New Orleans Jambalaya ( ).   My Cajun Pasta was okay.  It was plentiful, but just okay.  The seasonings were good and hot, but I really couldn't taste the true flavors because of the overwhelming hotness of the spices if that makes any sense to you.  Now I did try my Moms Jambalaya and I told her I would have better off ordering it instead of the Cajun Pasta. Overall the food was decent, but like any other chain, very predictable and not home-made or personal. I would rate BJ's on the same level I would a Outback Steakhouse, Olive Garden or Apple bee's - a solid 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=260

First, you're lucky if you are greeted when you walk in. Some of the hostesses just stare at you as if you should be the first to say something. Uhm, yes! Party of 3 please as you stare into my soul without uttering a word.  After being seated, can you tell us about the new items on your menu or maybe the new beer you are displaying? Oh, no? Ok I didn't realize that me not knowing what I want the second I sat down meant please don't come back for another 15 mins. How ridiculous! Then you take my order and it doesn't come out for another 45 mins? Hello! It wasn't even packed. It's quite sad, really. The service wasn't always this bad.

Stephanie S.,"Stockton, CA",533,242,1353,4.0,2/28/2011,"Another super larger group dinner at BJ's we give it to em because they're one of the few places for late night huge group dinners like ours. This time 25-30 I'm sure there were 30+ since those who didn't eat were back and forth from the table and the bar. Service was better for us than other nights we've had. So that's a +  Only thing that probably sucks would be...with large groups we can only have one check instead of separate checks. Our conclusion after planning this dinner out is, BJ's is the main place in town that can accomidate really large groups, decent prices for food, & one of the best places for dinner & drinks late at night vs going to have dinner and driving out to a bar.  I'm sure that BJ's loves us for the amount of $ we dropped on both food and alcohol to celebrate a good friends birthday.  LARGE GROUP TIPS: -gratuity is already added to the bill. Make sure everyone throws that in or you'll end up being super short to pay the bill. -If many people of the party are getting drinks, shots, and/or pitchers order them at the bar to make a separate tab, it makes it mains the dinner check let's hectic and easy to see what people are paying for -If it's a really busy night, even if you have reservations, they won't seat you unless half of the party is already there",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=260

Rem B.,"Stockton, CA",51,5,,1.0,12/23/2015,"Since the opening of this restaurant i've went here a lot as i worked in the same shopping center of it for a good 6 years. From all my experiences here Bjs in stockton is known for one thing. The lack of speed of service. I have come to just accept the fact that this restaurant is NEVER going to improve on that. Tonight i came here with my fiancé and two young sons meeting family for a night of drinks and appetizers, we showed up around 8 and ordered by 8:30 and boy did their slow service today really shine, by 8:55 my sons mini corndogs and fried plate came out with the flatbread pizza i ordered and holy cow were they cold. The flatbread was luke warm and very very hard and worst off they forgot my mother in laws flatbread pizza which finally came out around 9:40 and to top it off they didn't even comp it for the lack of care they put in their order. I guess they were too busy having devoted most of their servers to tending the large banquet group and forgot about the rest of the restaurant because their waitstaff was stretched thin but I've also become accustomed to that. Emily our server or Erika (not sure what her name was now) wasn't  clear and my mother in law ordered a alcoholic beverage that was far too strong and not close to what she asked for, forgot to bring my post pregnancy fiancé water she asked for to take her pain medication. Honestly im not sure if it is just this Stockton location but the food here is just awful. I only really used to come here when i worked in the area was for the wings and a handful of other items they dont even have on their menu anymore. I have had a handful of experiences here that were worse than this but i think this finally after all the years made me just not want to come here ever again. Their waitstaff has no clue what they're doing and the food varies what time of day you go.

I've been to the one in Vacaville, Sacramento, and today, I went to the one in Stockton. They all provide a similar atmosphere: decorations, spacious seating areas, high ceilings, and dim lighting. My review will focus on the bar, because we just went there for afternoon drinks :D The bar has a nice feel to it. The arrangement of the liquor and glasses had a touch of sophistication. BJ's provides the standard selection of wines, beers, and mixed drinks. My only complaint is how the menu failed to provide the price on certain drinks. I didn't know how much my mojito was until I got the bill :/  Our bartender was great as she helped us decide which wine we wanted. I'm always skeptical when it comes to the wine descriptions, but the Barefoot Chardonnay light taste did not disappoint. Green apple wine! :] yumyum~ Other drinks? Strawberry Mojito: delicious. not too sweet. definitely a light and refreshing taste with some strawberries mashed into the mint.  Mango Mojito: tasted like a regular mojito. I only tasted the lemon and mint.. could not detect the mango flavor. it was still good :] Although there's nothing to define this place as unique, BJ's provides a wonderful dining experience for its patrons. ...thumbs up to the bar :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=320

Someone ordered an extra pizooki to go after we ate ours & it never came (of course she was charged). They charged our card for the wrong amount & had to credit our card back & recharge it. He blamed it on us because we had separate tabs & it's the new waitresses fault (so unprofessional). His solution was a free pizooki. I told him we didn't want another pizooki.

We're talking salad dressing on the side people nothing fancy. Sometimes the food comes up quickly, sometimes it takes forever. It's frustrating, because we never know if we're going to have a good experience or not. The only reason we return is because of our son who loves the desserts.  They have an excellent drink selection, and many items on the menu to choose from. I just wish they would fix their glitches.

Mozzarella sticks are ridiculously cheesy goodness and my personal favorite item on the menu - crispy, seasoned well, and come with a delicious marinara sauce that disappears all too quickly. The mocktails (a play on 'cocktails', which are sweet mixes of fruit juices and tea or soda) have forced me to completely ignore their other soft drinks. Tonight was date night and my wife wanted a burger and fries. BJ's was the obvious choice. Our waitress was nothing special, but the manager was on top of it; just as I'd finished gabbing, I'd noticed my salmon was taking a bit too long to arrive. This is when he came in and told us what was going on with my meal and offered free soup to tie me over, then dessert on the house. Holy smokes, didn't see that coming! But when the salmon came, it was devoid of anything resembling flavor. And I ordered it blackened. Oh my. We finished the evening with a delectable cinnamon bun with ice cream and strawberries on it. Once we got the tab, something I was not expecting appeared on the receipt: a recommended tip. This is the first time I had ever seen this at BJ's and I was none too pleased about it. Whether this is new policy or obvious begging from our overeager manager, I felt pressured to spend more than I'd planned, a notion alone that soured a bit of my experience. Not sure if I want to return to a place where gratuity is taken for granted. I may update this review on my next visit to observe whether or not these new receipts have become a constant. If they have, this is the last time I'm emptying my wallet for BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=220
Alex L.,"San Jose, CA",1488,454,9471,4.0,3/28/2011,"Coming here on any weekend night is probably not a good idea.  The wait can be excruciating long.  Luckily for us, we walked right up to a booth in the bar area when someone was leaving!   I ordered the full rack of ribs with baked potato, the house salad, and calarmari as the appetizer.  Sunshine (our Waitress' name) brought it out lickety split and it was a nice portion to share.  For our entree, it took FIVEVER (longer than FOREVER).  Our lovely ray of Sunshine kept telling us ""it'll be right out"", ""it's on its way"", ""thank you for being patient, it'll be right out"".  Shoot, even the manager came by and told us ""thank you for waiting"".  He offered us some complimentary appetizer or dessert, but we already finished off the tentacles an hour ago so I counteroffered (because I'm Chinese and that's what Chinese people do) by asking him to take off a glass of wine off the bill.  He mentioned that he's unable to comp alcohol, but he'd go ahead and take 1/2 off our entrees.  Do I have ""stupid"" on my forehead?  Hale yeah!  That's like $20 off vs. $9 off.   Thanks Mister Manager.  You da bomb.   Then the ribs came out.  Argh.  Not good.  Not only was it not good, but it was dry, tough, and nasty.  I guess it's my fault for ordering ribs at a brewery huh?  The baked potato was like ginormous.  It was about the same size as a brick and about as dry as it too.  Ok, this spud's staying here and not riding along the ""take out"" box with the ribs.   Although the food wasn't all that great, I would still give BJs a solid 4 stars for the accomodation, service, and ""for trying"".  They didn't have to do any comping and it was probably my fault for ordering anything but a burger and fries and getting sloshed on their beer.  This is still a great place to eat with a decent ambiance.  Thanks for the great service.  I love me some BJ :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=220

Drinks are decent and prices okay. The one star is strictly due to their inattentive staff. The last 4-5 times I've been here there's usually one server for the WHOLE bar area.

They obviously don't care because they aren't fixing the problem. Recently we ordered a spinach dip appetizer, it came out cold. We complained so they took it back and reheated it. The Mgr came over and said he'd comp the app. My wife's sandwich came out with burnt bread. Sent it back and the next came out with in toasted bread...this was a dip sandwich so toasting the bread helps it not turn to mush when you dip it. She was hoping to eat half and save half...we chucked the second half. The chef/lead cook came to the table to discuss our complaint, he was nice and understood. They comped the sandwich but when we got the bill the app was back on there....such a disappointment. I didn't say anything else, tipped my server based on what the total bill would have been including the cost of the comped sandwich (wasn't her fault) and left. We won't be back anytime soon for sure.

Had a salad that was drenched in dressing. very heavy handed.  lastly, had tortilla soup and tomato bisque. They were of a quality on a par with the soups you get from Safeway (Signature soups). Sure those are alright from the grocery store, full of salt, but still....they aren't bad at all. But at a restaraunt ?  I felt that they literally just opened up one of those, poured it in a bowl and served it up for a price. The soup was not fresh, thick and disgusting.  Service, atmosphere, timing of service, dealing with sent back food was all good. I will not be going back because I can get better food at the grocery store.  Also, had 2 of their beers (red, pale ale). Not exceptional, nothing to write home about and they had ample selections from the tap. kudos for that. if I wanted to go somewhere to have a drink and an appetizer, I would go back.

Yes you can say ""well, you can simply grab her attention and ask for a refill,"" but everytime we said it, she would ignore us and keep on doing her laps around our section giving no customers any attention. The tables around us had leftover food from the time we got there (so she was obviously not cleaning her area either). For coming with a group of 12, we figured they at would've at least been more attentive, but sadly that is not the case with Kristine.

We were seated as soon as we walked in.  The server took our order, and we received our appetizer fairly quickly (15 min?). Then we waited for our entrée, then waited, then waited. Finally 3 of the 4 of us received our meal. The server told us that the cook forgot to make our fourth friends' meal, which were fish tacos. When she received her fish tacos, it looked more like a lettuce salad and 2 slices of hardened finger-shaped fish. Our other friend ordered the Salmon with asparagus and quinoa which looked nothing like the photo (there were probably 2 tablespoons of quinoa on the whole plate).  We asked for the manager, and the manager  said that the food is prepared in the same proportion all the time - which is not true because we've been there times before for the same meals and we had no issues with proportions before. The manager asked if we wanted another meal in replacement for the fish tacos - but we would still be charged for the fish tacos. My friend, who lost her appetite by this time, declined. The server returned and told us she was taking the tacos off the bill, but when we received our bill it was still on there, so we called for the manager again. The manager said she did not approve the tacos being taken off the bill, but we told her the server told us she would. She reluctantly said ok, rolled her eyes, and took the bill from the table to remove the taco meal.  Oh, and by the way...we were there for a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes - from the time they opened the bill to the time we stepped out. So unfortunate - the other BJ's Restaurants had wonderful service and great food, but they are not closeby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=300

Danny D.,"Stockton, CA",2,25,13,2.0,1/5/2016,"I am writing this review to express my disappointment on the recent change in their corporate decision on the lighting in the restaurant. If you visit this restaurant during the day or when there is daylight outside you won't know any difference. I went there last night with my girlfriend and her coworkers for dinner at 6:30pm. We sat in the middle of the main dining area. At around a quarter to seven that evening the lights started to dim. It wasn't even a subtle change, the lights went from 80% to 25%. A couple people from our party had to use the flashlight app on their smart phones to see the menu. There were other people at other tables doing the same thing. ITS TOO DARK IN THERE! I want to see my average food. Its is also a safety hazard for the people working there. God forbid if a drink were to spill on the floor. You wouldn't be able to see it. Complaints were made to the manager who insisted there wasn't anything he could do at the time and that it is a decision made by corporate. Well, once accidents start to increase because people can't see and fall because of the lighting situation then a change will be made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=300

Humanios ..,"San Jose, CA",8,3,8,1.0,9/14/2014,"So I've been to BJ's in various other cities prior to coming to this BJ's in Stockton. It's amazing how waiters/waitresses, hostess, and presumably management can change the experience. I came here with my girlfriend on a September weekend and was amazingly disappointed and frustrated with the experience. Things started pretty well, we were greeted and shown to our table with much respect, we even had a waitress who was nice enough. We received water and our food orders were taken. I ordered and Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon, and she ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. The chicken pita tacos comes with a side of grains which she asked to substitute with a salad. Wasn't a problem and shortly after she received her salad. This is when things took a turn in the opposite direction. No one likes to wait for their food but that experience is made worse when suddenly your server is no where to be found. Our server (Erika) never came by for another 30-40 minutes to give us any indication of whether our food would ever be coming out. At this point we assumed she forgot to place the order in. Just as we were about to get another server's attention, a different waitress (didn't get her name) came back with our food and apologized that it took long, and that my girlfriend's plate didn't have all the ingredients they were supposed to have. I assume she had other tables to wait on so she left after apologizing (on Erika's behalf I guess) that the greek yogurt was missing. A few minutes later Erika returned and apologized the food took so long. It turned out they were out Greek yogurt (topping for the pita), and rather than communicate this with us from the start had made a decision to replace it with sour cream, only after presumably waiting for the food to get cold. She also added the side of grains despite specifically asking to omit them, waste of food. Both our dishes were cold (and not very good) and she quickly exited the scene after a quick ""sorry"". We were both pretty astounded to say the least. I don't think we would've minded if they were out of yogurt if we knew at an earlier stage, but you can't just take a healthy meal, with feta cheese and light ingredients, then just pour sour cream on top instead. Those kind of decisions should be up to the customer and always communicated.  Anyways, we never received that yogurt, and neither of us finished our meals. We didn't take anything to go but were still asked for desert. No, I couldn't risk waiting another 30 minutes for our ice cream pizooki only to find that they ran out of ice cream and rather than let us know decided to let the warm cookie get cold and just put sour cream on top instead.  I hope these servers (who I'm certain are nice people) learn to communicate better with their customers. Would've made the world of difference (although the food was still crap).

We were seated nearly right away, pausing only so they could clean and set up a table for us. Our waiter was attentive, charismatic, knowledgeable, and prompt! He kept our waters filled, switched out empty Coke glasses for full ones, gave us a run down of all their drink specials and seasonal dishes. He encouraged dessert, but in a non-pressuring sort of way. The food was also pretty good. I had the enLIGHTened Thai Chicken Mango salad (dressing on the side). It was tasty with a good ratio of chicken to salad, which is often something lacking in low-calorie dishes. The dressing was also quite tasty. It seemed that everyone else loved their dishes also. My mom ordered the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi, my sister ordered the Chicken Fettucini Alfredo, my dad ordered the Turkey Club, and my uncle ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza deep dish.  When my sister inquired about the garlic bread that was supposed to come with her dish according to the picture on the menu, the waitress who delivered it said it didn't come with it. However, moments later, our main waiter came by and delivered a couple slices of garlic bread saying, ""I always think the dish should look like the picture"". So nice! We were in a bit of a rush to head out towards the end of our meal, so we asked for the check and our waiter was quick to hand it over and also got a box for the other half of my uncle's pizza.

Jose G.,"Aromas, CA",6,100,6,3.0,10/6/2010,"I had to give it 3 as opposed to two due to the fact that the food was good and better than I expected. we came here to eat and have a relaxed time. I've worked in the Restaurant industry before as a waiter and floor manager and was not impressed by how they were conducting business. Granted this is located int he Ghetto of California ( Stockton) so maybe the waiters and floor managers were having a bad time with the local populace.. who knows... who cares.. not  my problem. there was some debacle over the seating arrangement and no one could understand how to fix it. so I took it upon myself to ask a waitress who was clueless and had to go an get some manager. i explained to him how to fix it without violating fire codes or disturbing other guests.  he went back to ask the floor manager...   our waitress Anne comes by to take our orders while all this is happening except we weren't aware she was taking orders. she didn't make an effort or attempt to get our attentions and it was only by chance that I saw her with her pen and pad. I then got everyone's attention told the manager to come back after the orders were placed. drinks and some orders were taken and we were left alone with our seating arrangement fiasco I got inpatient and decided to re arrange it.. allowing even more room for the waitresses to walk and expanding seating availability for our group. so by this time our waitress claimed that she was ending her shift and passed us over to  Shaniqua ( I kid you not)    ** OK I kid! I don't remember her name but  ""Shaniqua""helps the story . **    **had to add this disclaimer as some people have been getting their panties up in a wad**.  Shaniqua seemed like a good gal and proceeded to take our remaining orders.   by the time the orders come in we see our old waitress still working just not our table.. I guess we somehow scared her off..  after about 45 minutes we begin to get our food. and another 30 pass before the whole table is plated. there were incorrect orders and after we politely stated that some of the things on our plates were wrong, shaniqua decided to give us the attitude. the floor manager came up to us apologizing for the confusion and letting us know that our plate would be right up. the guy kept returning to our table always apologizing.. I guess there might have been another table there causing a ruckus and we were somehow mistaken for them. I have toned this down severely. in order not to scare any reader about this place. I think it's an alright establishment for all we knew.. this may have been the starting night for many of these servers.. it was a Saturday night after all and the place was packed. I had the Thai Salmon dish and will have to admit that it was quite tasty..  asides from the confusions , seating and waitress fiasco,  I can say the wait was worth it. their beer was alright.. nothing special but better than your typical commercial can. I've experienced better beers and selections at a Yardhouse or local brewery. but hey this beer selection might just fancy your pallet.. I say give it a try.  taste is subjective to one's preferences after all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=400

Food was definitely below average: Rack of ribs - burnt; Roast beef sandwich with wedge fries - fries burnt(!); Angel hair pasta with chicken - pasta overcooked, tiny portion of chicken.  Sliders - they were OK. Definitely over-rated, over priced for what it is.  I would go back - but to try the beer then go somewhere else for dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=400
Josh V.,"Stockton, CA",253,70,11,3.0,1/24/2011,"I make it very clear that I don't like chain restaurants but I have a special bond with BJ's as it used to be my temple of underage drinking. In life they say it's ""all about who you know"" and I knew the people who had access to beer. I feel like I'm snitching but those people don't even work there anymore and that was almost five years ago. If you enjoy alcohol, a fun atmosphere and edible food I'm pretty sure you would like BJ's. I've had many great memories here from what I can remember. I've tried almost everything on the menu and my favorite by far would be the New Orlean's Jambalaya which combines blackened chicken, shrimp and chicken-andouille sausage, bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce served over rice pilaf. I'd suggest sharing it since it comes in a gigantic portion and because its' a bit pricey, about $15 US dollars.  Besides that I wouldn't come here for dinner as it's more of an appetizer and drinks destination. The staff is usually on top of everything and friendly, accept that one. You know, the one that works at every restaurant. If you come here with a big party be weary that splitting the bill between people here is like trying to split a freaking atom. Not sure if they've fixed that yet but every party I've been to it's always been a major issue.

Danny S.,"Stockton, CA",2,10,,4.0,9/16/2010,"This place has a great atmosphere, this is one of those places where you can have a few drinks and have a great time. I wouldnt expect to come here and have a nice quiet dinner, this is a place for when you need to let lose a little. Everyone here seems to be enjoying themselves so much, that no one pays any attention to what you are doing. However, if you are uptight without a drink and don't want to drink, you might get annoyed by the noise level.  From what I have tried, they have good drinks too. I dont consider myself a lightweight, but after one or two iced teas I was feeling pretty good.  Also, it is not like Chillis in that from when I have been there, there hasnt been some punk kid going up and down the restaraunt on his skate shoes. Man I hate those skate shoes. However, they were very accommodating to my two year old daughter. giving her snacks the entire time. If your baby cries in restaraunts but you want to go out, take them here at 9pm on the weekend, no one will hear a thing.

David C.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/14/2015,"I generally like BJ's in various locations.  However tonight at this BJ's in Stockton it was consistently poor. After waiting 10 mins after being seated I finally went and asked the hostess if anyone was assigned to my area (even though several employees walked by without even glancing my direction). Finally a server arrived, so I placed my order immediately. A few minutes later she started to put a check on my table before realizing I just ordered from her.  After another 15 mins, the chili and wedge salad arrived. The chili tasted good, but was only lukewarm.  The wedge salad was mediocre at best. I never saw my server again throughout dinner and after waiting another 10-15 mins since finishing eating I finally decided I would just leave $10 to cover the dinner ($9.60 ). While I was at the hostess station getting change for a $20, the server came running with the check. I told her it was the worst service I've ever had there and gave her the $10.  I am a BJ's Rewards member because I usually like their food and service.

Not even the fact that my son came home on leave from iraq and picked this place as the spot for us all to get together for the evening am I upping the stars. It was underwhelming at best.   After we ate my twins asked me if I was going to Yelp about the place and how many stars I thought I would give.  I told them if I wrote the review right then and there it would be two stars.  They told me that is what they were thinking as well.  My little future yelpers! The service was OK, the drinks were not OK and the food was over priced for ""roadhouse"" style food. No one at the table raved about how great their food was - I mean, my salmon was good, my husbands ribs were good, my twins shared a burger it was good, my son had jambalaya it was good.  You get the idea. Oh, and get this:  we made reservations for 7p, half of our party was on time the other half was running about a half hour late - they went ahead and seated the first five people but told them ""you only get the table until 9pm""   I'm like ""what?""  Is there another party coming in right after us for the remaining hour you are open?  I absolutely understand if you have another group coming in then too bad for us.  But they did not.   How did we know, you ask?  Because we did not leave until 930.  HA! I just found them to be un-accomodating (i.e. they would not substitute wheat bread for the multi grain and when asked if they could split the bill in half we were told no, is that common?)  In today's economy when a party of eleven comes in and drops 400.00 on dinner it's a nice gesture to try to work with the patrons.

I was surprised to find that the Stockton location is rather refined in comparison. The interior of this new-er BJs is rather fancy and posh (again in comparison to the shabbiness I am accustomed to) and people are dressed accordingly. The bar is actually a bar and not someplace to briefly sit while you're waiting for your table. The only thing about this location I could identify with was the food. (Thank goodness.)

Great selection of food with varying quality. Appetizers are great, but overpriced. Pizza is overrated. Burgers and sandwiches are good, not great.  Pizookie is one of the best desserts you can find in any chain restaurant. What really sets this place apart is the drinks. The root beer here is the best I've ever had, and I don't even like root beer. Best of all it's served in a chilled mug. Last time I came here I think I had at least 4 of them.

And they're not in those tiny shot glasses either, but half the size of a regular glass. I tasted a couple and they were nice. My niece suggests we order a couple of pizzas. A white and a red. Well, I haven't eaten pizza in a long time but I go along with it because she's says they're fantastic. I have a piece of the white.....it has chicken, white sauce and a ton of ooey gooey cheese. I have to say it was pretty damn good. We were a party of 7 and managed to have dinner and a couple drinks each and still got out of there for about $125. (me and the bf usually do that much damage on our own) Like I said above.. minus one star because the server took so long to greet us. Four stars for good grub and good spirits.

The beer is at a decent price for the variety and the atmosphere. The service at the bar is very good. This is a nice place to hang out with friends and have a beer. However, the food is mediocre especially at the prices they charge. And the service is definitely sub-par when sitting at a table instead of the bar. The one thing that brought this place down was their reservation system. We called ahead to make reservations for a party of 9 and were told they only do reservations for a party of 10 or more. We asked if it would help if we called back and said there were 10 of us to make the reservation. We finally had to talk to a manager to get the reservation put through.  Besides that the place is OK. Again a nice atmosphere for friends to gather in and have a lite snack and a cold drink.  Not so much for a family party of 9 trying to make sure they have a seat when they get there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=480

I saw the same manager there! He recognized me, too! And I could have sworn he was stalking me! Little did I know, he was transferred from the Cupertino store to the one in Stockton!

(It comes out med-rare, but most places won't cook it rare.) Make sure you get the wedge-cut fries, they're delicious with some ranch! I wouldn't suggest some of the outlandish over the top pizzas. There's just too much stuff on them and it gets soggy and weird.  Their beer selection is awesome and the servers will help you pick out something that will go with your food.

Although the restaurant itself was nice & clean, I was not at all impressed with the food, as expected from any chain restaurant. The BFF took me here for lunch. She had the sesame chicken salad, which she enjoyed, I had a bite, and thought it was pretty good, but not the best i've had. I had the turkey cobb. The waitress asked if I wanted the lunch-sized version (which was half a sandwich), and i'm glad i did, bc i couldn't even finish the half i got. It definitely sounded a lot better on the menu. It was supposed to be on garlic-toasted french bread, but instead the bread was slightly soggy with no hint of garlic. It actually tasted like a plain turkey sandwich with avocado (that I could have easily made at home, but mine would taste a lot better). The turkey meat was salty and tasted like the oscar meyers ones you get at the grocery store.  I specifically asked for light sauce, but of course it was drenched in bleu cheese dressing. The side of fries were good though and the service wasn't so bad. I probably would only come here for drinks, not the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=480

Julie T.,"Ripon, CA",3,17,12,4.0,5/29/2010,"So, I had lunch here with my little sister. I've been wanting to take her since the last time I saw it from the inside of SF Boudin. She hasn't been to BJ's before, but I have (twice at Modesto's BJs and once in Torrance, CA). It was a Saturday and only 12:30pm. Parking was close and easy on this day. We walked in and were quickly seated. She ordered the Grilled Chicken Club ($9.50) and I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken ($12.50). The Service: One thing I found weird once we were seated by the person who takes us to our seat, she offered us both the drinks menu and was explaining it to the BOTH of us. Keep in mind that my little sister is only 15 yrs old, though I am the drinking age. The waitress service was great at first. Quick and friendly. While we were talking and waiting for our order, our waitress SARAH, checked in on us to make sure things were okay. Once we got our food, the service went downhill and rushed. She refilled our diet coke a bit prematurely (it was only half way; and on the second cup, it was only drunken 10%. We didn't get charged for it, but wasting food and drinks is a peeve of mine.) Second, the waitress was asking a little too many times if everything was doing okay. I know its nice to be checked in, but not sooo many times while you're eating and have food in your mouth. While we were about 40% into our meals, the waitress asked if we wanted dessert. 5 mins. later, gave me the check. Then came back a few mins. later to offer a box for our foods and pick up the payment. When she came back after swiping my card, she quickly collected the dishes. Sure, some people may like this type of service, but I felt really rushed when I wanted to just enjoy my meal in peace and take all the time I wanted. The place was not packed, probably only 40%-50% filled. Food: I knew what i was going to expect with the food, as I've ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken before. It was delicious! I had left overs and ate it when I was home.... i want more! Trust me... not a lot of food has made me weak and crave for it like this. Yum! The chicken, the mashed potatoes, the steamed broccoli. Mmm! My sister enjoyed her Grilled Chicken Club really well too. and she liked the thin fries a lot. The food is great, if you can get past the prices. The service could DEFINITELY be improved.

It took about 15 minutes to get my beer. During which we ordered.  I ordered just a house salad which I've ordered before. At 5:30 I was feeling really full from half a pint of beer. Something that generally happens when a tap doesn't have the co2 set right.  At 5:45 my salad finally arrived. My daughters pizza and sliders had not arrived yet. My car was ready and I needed to pick it up. I had a bite of a strange house salad. It had spinach leaves instead of lettuce. No cucumbers. Diced tomatoes instead of sliced and some kind of cheese. The taste was off. I had a second bite and something was definitely wrong. I left to get air and pick up my car hoping the fresh air would help.  I got my car and went back across the street and by now I was feeling horribly sick. I left some money with my friend and went home.  I was horribly sick and managed to make it to bed where I slept until my alarm the next morning went off(about 11 hours) Today I'm still sick and can't eat or keep anything down.

Rexelle S.,"Stockton, CA",49,29,,4.0,4/23/2011,"Been here a couple of times. Looks just like any other BJs. If you go to UOP, you can use your Pacific Cash. It's a great casual place for family and friends. It has a sports bar and flat screen TVs placed around the restaurant for those who aren't sitting at the bar. They even give you the option to take out in which you can order online, on the phone, or at the restaurant which is usually located on the side of the entrance. The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's too dark. I enjoy their deep pizza dishes as well as the infamous pazookies. Believe it or not, a lot of people have no idea what a pazookie is...REALLY?! I don't want to sound like a fatty but by this time, I thought the word would spread like fire lol. Also, kids can design their own pizzas! They have this whole sha-bam of what they want on it, how they want it, and then I think it comes with sides, a drink, and a dessert!  Their signature non-virgin drinks are pretty good. I'm a mixed drink type of person so I enjoy their ""smoothies"" and ""sodas"" lol..(Strawberry Splash, Berri Delicious, and Frosty Peach are the signature drinks I've tasted) I've also tried their traditional mojito and a couple of their signature brewed beers...Mind you, I don't go here to drink even during happy hour lol or any place for that matter...but those are just some drinks I've had while accompanied by friends and family. Anyway, the main reason I would go to BJs is for their garden fresh specialty salads! O-M-G. So far, I've tried the Sante Fe, BBQ Chicken, and BJ's Cobb salads and let me tell you, the flavors NEVER fail! They also give you a buttload of it so you'll have plenty to take home...unless you're just a big eater then eat away..but for me, it's rare I finish my food at restaurants.  Another plus about BJ's is they have an approximate calorie count for each item on the menu. Cool right? Very helpful especially with all the diets and weight watchers out there! Most of the servers in stockton's BJ are usually REALLY friendly and I think it's because 1) they may be a working student 2) they really want a high tip lol Nonetheless, I crave for their salads.

The portions for lunch were large such that only Hubby could finish his.  I tried the all you can eat soup & salad for about $9.  The salad was a non-anchovy Caesar and soup of your choice.  The Caesar was pretty good with crunchy, fresh croutons.  The clam chowder was salty but tasty.  For my refill, I tried the broccoli cheddar soup which disappointed me.  It was way saltier than the clam chowder and I have a recipe for this soup which tastes much better.   Our server was really nice and she was very attentive, promptly bringing refills of soda, water and my soup/salad refills.  Might consider coming back but would have to look for lower sodium items on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=360

Sure, you have to tweak your orders to get exactly what you want, but they've always done it for me with NO problem.  I'm a picky eater, but they always get it right. I want a Cuban burger with turkey burger instead of beef, no cheese. Can I get steamed vegetables instead of french fries? No problem. Can I get a mini buffalo chicken pizza with no ranch dressing, easy cheese and extra buffalo sauce? No problem. Maybe I'm just very polite and they like that,  because they've always accommodated my requests with a smile. And the buffalo chicken pizza? So f'ing good. It's like crack. And the beers are awesome. The Nitwit (which is, unfortunately no longer available) is one of the best beers you'll find within an hour's radius. Perfect.  The only reason they are lacking a fifth star is this: the happy hour rules. In the menu it says happy hour is from 3-7, then from 10-closing. 1/2 price mini pizzas, $2 off apps, and $1 off drinks. Awesome! However, you apparently have to sit in the bar. Nowhere on the menu is this little rule included. So, we sit all 6 of us at a table in the main dining area, order our mini pizzas and drinks, and the tab is full price. If you're going to make the rule that happy hour only applies if you sit in the bar PRINT THAT RULE ON THE MENU. I'm not a mind reader. And I'm not a cheapskate, but that is an awesome happy hour and I don't like feeling duped.

Miguel A.,"Stockton, CA",0,1,,3.0,11/10/2012,"""BJ's Restaurant and Brew house"" I really love the pizza from BJ's, but my only complaint is that the waiters sometimes are really slow. For example, they come to get you started with drinks but they do not usually bring them until the food arrives which is ridiculous because the drinks are ready. Let me tell you about the pizza, their menu includes a different variety of pizzas. You can choose between meat and vegetables and you can put as many ingredients as you want. One of my favorites is the BJ's Favorite, but I hate olives so I always replace them with jalapenos because I love spicy food. Another one of my favorites is the chicken BBQ pizza, so delicious which I also add jalapenos. If you love them both, you can also get two of your favorite pizzas in one, awesome right? When I cannot decide which one I want the most, I just get half of the BJ's favorite & half of the chicken BBQ. They also have a different variety of beers, which include their own beers and international beers, so you have plenty of options. I love dark beer, one of my favorites is the nutty brunette; and if you want to explore their beers you can ask to try it. Which is awesome because you try different beers and based on that you can choose which one is the best choice for you. I can say I have had good service at times but it is not consistent. Depending on the waiter that is how your experience is going to go. On my last visit I had such a great waiter, she was checking on us often which I appreciate. Obviously by the end, when my check was ready I gave her a fair tip. I must say depending on the service that is how I based the tip they will receive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=420

Beers are pretty good, tried the sampler and out of 8, only 2 were below avg.  Food was definitely not bad, a Pot Roast Sandwich looked okay, kinda Carrow's looking, and my Shrimp Pasta was tasty with chunks of bacon, red peppers and burst of parmesan in a creamy sauce.  My only knock on the dish was that the sauce was poured over the pasta not cooked into the sauce, and with the shit load of pasta you got, it just looked really ""cafeteria"". Came on a Sat. night and this place was busy.  An hour wait for a table in the restaurant at 9 pm.  We sat at the bar and even though it was busy there were places to sit.  So, not bad of a place, and it still seems like Stockton's ""hot spot""for now I just wouldn't wait an hour to eat here, that's all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=420

We came here around 10 ish at night so it wasn't packed at all. There was still enough people there though. I've been here a few times and the food isn't terrible yet not over the top either. Our hostess (which ironically was a friend of mine in highschool) seated us quickly and our server came out within a couple of minutes. I was kinda dumbfounded because she asked us already if we were ready to order just seconds after we opened the menu. We asked for a few minutes, but before she left, she did take our drink orders and came back super quick. When it was time to order, I had the Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich. When I got my food, it looked great. It was super hot too, so I know it wasn't just sitting there for a while. I was super hungry and probably made the food taste better. Haha. After dinner, the server came by and asked him if he was ready for his birthday dessert. He looked surprised and within a few minutes, got his Birthday Pizookie. It didn't feel special as she just came up to our table, lit the candle, said ""Happy Birthday"", and walked away. He was expecting a little song like other chain restaurants. That was a bummer. The Pizookie was awesome though! The atmosphere of the place is nice. Dim lights, flat screen TV's everywhere with one jumbo one at the bar. However, the floor is quite smooth and glossy... So high heeled wearers beware... Where the place is located isn't in a bad spot either. This place is good for the appetizers and I heard the beer too.

However, when I have visited during the busy part of the day or during special televised sporting events, I've experienced some pretty slow...and I mean sloooooow service...not always, but more often than not. I think one of the best thing about this (and all other BJs that I have been into) is that you can usually order items that have been removed from the menu over the last few years. For example, you can order a full order of brushetta instead of the tiny order that's on the menu...so you get 3-4 times the size for about twice the cost.

If BJ's only served pizookies, they would still be packed every night of the week.  Their food is good, but the pizookies are their claim to fame IMO (in my opinion).  The chopped salad is good and so is the cheese and tomato pizza.  Good, not fantastic. However, if you're seeking a mind altering experience, come here for the crazily delicious pizookies.  They have several different types of cookie to choose from, I've had the oreo (yummy) and the regular chocolate chip, and OMG, can we say food coma?  Seriously, they're the best thing ever.  Awesome hint: say it's your birthday and you get one for FREE!

Jason F.,"Holladay, UT",46,235,119,4.0,12/4/2009,This location is in a crowded shopping area just north of the two shopping malls so parking can be a bit tough sometimes.

The food is tastes freshly made and has a good flavor to it and the service is great. On weekends you will probably have to wait. They will give you the standard pager to carry around with you while you wait.  For the geeks who must wait there is a Best Buy right across the street.

Kaytie C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",43,79,199,4.0,8/24/2010,I remember the first time I came to this restaurant even though they were opened for a while and it has a great atmosphere. There's a bar with stools and a big plasma screen TV for those of you big sports fan out there then this area is just a great fit for you.  I had their Hawaiian pizza it was delicious but I couldn't finish it even though I ordered the smallest size pizza. The menu was pretty pricey based on what you order and the pizza was one of them. The service was great since the waitress and waiter were friendly to customers. It was a great evening with friends.  Inside was nicely decorated and they had several plasma TVs around so that all of the customers would enjoy a great game. I've been coming back a couple of other times and each and every time the service was excellent. One of their famous Pizookie dessert was awesome! It's really to die for if you're the type of person who loves sweets! I like the Pizookie but I'm not used to eat something that sweet but it wouldn't hurt to have it once in a while especially if you have a rough day.  One thing that I dislike is the parking. Every parking space feels like it's compacted. What happens if there's big SUVs and trucks parked next to a small car and who hits who? The small car is most likely gonna get crammed.

One of the best beer selections at any stockton location, I prefer this beer over Valley Brewery. To top it all off the wait staff is batting damn near 1000.00%. I cant think of anytime my order was messed up. All of the servers/bartenders that I have encountered have been good at their jobs and friendly except for one or two which I dont see very often.

Clarisse C.,"Hayward, CA",196,338,68,3.0,1/10/2009,"We surprised my dad his weekend for his 64th birthday. We decided to celebrate early since we couldn't make it out to Stockton during the week. He typically doesn't like to eat out or chooses a Chinese buffet or Sizzler's. It would've been good to try something new and I only wish it was a bit better so that he'd be more inclined to eat out at new restaurants. They DO have a handicap ramp which is always a plus, but you have to go through a bunch of tables to get to it. We waited quite awhile for our food...even just to order it and by that point everyone was starving.  Service was super slow. Food was good as usual, but you know the whole ambiance counts too. We were lucky enough to have them store a cake in the back and bring it out with a candle (no service charge thank goodness).

BJs is a chain restaurant, so i take it for what it is... it's an establishment that needs to crank out the same level of food as it's brother and sister restaurants. if you can walk in there with that understanding, then the food there is yummy.

By the time I arrived, my friends had been there for over 20 minutes with barely a drink order being taken. Not that I am squeamish about such things, but a fork in my allegedly clean silverware service had a large piece of greenery that had been been a part of another guests meal, not cool BJ's. The kicker came at the end, they were unwilling to split the check so we could pay with individual cards. After about forty minutes of back and forth we firmly insisted that they either split things up or not get paid. Why couldn't that have been done from the start? The waitstaff here seems exceptionally demoralized, which leads me to believe that BJ's sent their worst manager here so as not to contaminate other locations.

Secondly, this opening was presented as a benefit for a local charity - Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.  All meals were comped by BJ's, and diner's were requested to make a donation to the Charity.  Tips were collected separately AND also donated to CFF.  We paid only for gratuities and drinks.  What a pleasant, win-win way to enter a new marketplace. Speaking of drinks!  We sampled a full flight of their handcrafted brews and I found my newest favorite -- Nutty Brewnette.  Totally delish and never bitter - even at it's warmest end.   I ordered the Scampi Pasta, and sampled the friend's selections; Meat Loaf, Chicken Salad, and giant Stuffed Potato.  All tasted very good, and all were presented very nicely.   We were also served their choice of appetizer, Mozzarella Sticks; and dessert, BJ'S Famous Pizookie.  Will I be back - definitely...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=500

Ryan W.,"Stockton, CA",23,31,,4.0,7/8/2008,"Overall, I think the food here is a nice addition to Stockton.  I've had the pizza, the fish & chips, the blackened chicken pasta, and a cheseburger over two trips here.  Until the newness of this location wears off, I would not suggest going their on a Fri/Sat night and waiting for an hour for a table.   All of the food I've tried was good to very good.  The fish and chips might be the best in stockton, but I found another restaurant in Fremont several years ago (Jack's brewery) that can't be beat in my eyes.  The pizza was excellent deep dish style (reminded me of when Uno's was still around)   The chicken and cheeseburger were both very good.   This restaurant can be kinda on the pricey side, but at least they save you money on drinks.  I tried several different beers, and they all sucked.  I think they were just all too far on the sweet side.  If I could have Valley Brewery's beer (Thier food is horrendous) with BJ's food I would be one happy camper.  The mixed drinks bring me to a pet pieve of mine - drinks without prices.  I ordered a Patron Anjeo specialty martini.  It was strong, which is fine for me, but I'm sure it didn't contain any more than 1-1.5 oz of alcohol given it's size.  When the bill came I realized that it was a $9.50 drink.  I understand paying $6-7 for premium liquor, and may have even decided to try the drink at $9.50(doubtful).  But with no prices on the menu for the variety of coctails, there is no way to make an informed decision on if you want to order any coctails...and nearly $10/drink is the price you should pay at a ballpark, not a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=540

John T.,"Westwood, CA",2,31,,1.0,2/18/2008,"I don't understand the hype about this place (at this location). I went here for lunch during my periodic trips to Stockton. I had the Pot Roast and I must say, it tasted awful. The gravy pretty much consisted of gravy mix, a ton of cornstarch, and water. It left a bitter aftertaste and I found it to be inedible. My friend had the Chicken Fried Steak; I had a bite since it was relatively big. It had the same formula: some kind of packaged gravy mix, a ton of cornstarch, and water. The beef was tender, but bland. The chicken was hard, but had a stale taste which could have come from the cooking oil. How did I know that it was full of cornstarch? The ""gravy"" pretty much solidifed in the middle of the meal. It tasted very starchy as well. The mashed potatoes were probably the best part of the entree that was edible. The steamed vegetables were pretty much soggy oversteamed vegetables sprinkled with way too much Lawry's seasoning salt. Disgusting. It is sad when the best part of the meal was the appetizer (the onion strings). How can you screw that up. It was bland, but the sauce was good enough. Overall, I would not come back. I did not have a drink though... it was 11am in the morning, haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=540

Tara W.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",7,4,,4.0,12/29/2008,"I waited tables for about six years and during my experience I served wonderfully one day or one table and horrible another day or another table for whatever reason. Also, my boyfriend and I eat out very often. The truth is people - It's not BJ's who is horrible at good service- It's any restaurant whether it be a chain or independent restaurant. Trust me I know. I worked for a lousy independent restaurant and needless to say, it did not last; Nor did the second time they opened.  BJ's food is pretty good. My boyfriend and I eat healthy due to heath reasons and we modify the crap out of our dishes. It doesn't surprise us when they mess up even though it's annoying. But if anything is wrong with the food or they didn't bring it out correctly or to our satisfaction, they would fix the problem. Sometimes even comp a dish or appetizer. I used to live in Folsom and went to the BJ's their many many times and received both great and ridiculous service. Granted it's up to BJ's to hire a staff that would give excellent service, but they can't monitor everyone. It's unfortunate and it sucks when you get shitty service, but that is normal in most restaurants. BJ's does brew their own beer but at a location in L.A.. (I read a person's review that they didn't brew their own beer and wanted to correct that statement) (unless of course I was given the wrong info by a BJ's manager) So I give four stars because I am a fan and I really liked everything I had there. Although BJ's management needs to hire genuine waiters, the ambiance is cool and open. The booths are roomy, the TVs are huge, they are open late, it's casual or dressy, and the mood their is usually pretty happy and once again, the food tastes great! Oh, and for those of you don't know, ""all"" drinks are served with an equal amount of alcohol by law. If you want to taste the alcohol in your drink, then I suggest you order either a short, or a double. Perhaps just order a vodka martini, but then chances are, you'll just bitch and moan about how strong it is. Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-stockton?start=540

We did not ask  for money back or anything just figured he might want to know! Flavor wise everything was delicious - just nothing worse than expecting a medium rare steak and getting a tough overcooked one instead :( I'm not one to send food back or be nasty about it so I just ate it.

Our waitress was totally oblivious to this conversation or just didnt care that she tried to sit me in a bed of crumbs, salt and chunks of beef. We could not decide right away what to order but that didnt matter because our M.I.A waitress, Jessica, was nowhere to be found. While in the restroom I heard 2 of the workers talking and 1 was telling the other one that some guest was requesting a new waitress, I'm guessing it was our waitress. She was just awful. Spit while she spoke to us, took forever to take our drink orders or even to give water. Honey, its like 96 degrees outside and we are roasting and we cannot even get a cold drink! Little Miss Jessica finally took our order. Then she fiiiinally brought our drinks. The food came and tasted ok, better every other time we have been there. Thanks for that experience.
