Gianna O.,"Sugar Land, TX",57,465,642,4.0,1/5/2018,"We have been here a few times now and each time the service has been very friendly and the food consistently good. It looks clean and the wait, with the exception of weekend nights, has never been very long.  The menu is pretty big and covers most food categories. On our latest visit, we began with fried cheese curds and spinach stuffed mushrooms. Both were quite good. I especially liked that the mushrooms contained artichokes as well as spinach. The cheese curds were soft and squeaky and very tasty. The drink I ordered was the Blood Orange Pom Sangria. The orange slice served on it was not a blood orange but it was still very good. The neat thing about this drink was it contained Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey which I had never had before. It was sweet with a bit of cinnamony heat and cooling citrus. I recommend this as a drink to try.  I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. It's light but flavorful and is served with cheesy mashed potatoes, broccoli and a Chardonnay lemon butter sauce. Also ordered was the Spicy Pig Tavern Cut Pizza. It's like a thin flatbread and very crisp. This one has ham, applewood smoked bacon, pineapple and jalapeño. The other dish ordered was the Southern Comfort chicken sandwich which has crisp fried chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, sliced ham, alfredo sauce and a Dijon mayonnaise.  My extreme sweet tooth kind of demands dessert so I got the chocolate chunk cookie Pizookie, a sizable chocolate chunk cookie served in a round pan like a deep dish pizza and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Very enjoyable! The meal was good and we never felt rushed. We left quite full and satisfied.  If you don't want much of a wait make sure to get there from 5-5:30 PM or at least before 6PM on weekends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land

Kristen U.,"Los Fresnos, TX",284,33,1,4.0,11/24/2017,"Was very satisfied with the food and the customer service was amazing. I ordered the California chicken club with sweet potato fries and a bowl of tomato bisque soup. My fiancé ordered a BBQ burger with fries. Both were extremely delicious. We also ordered a Cookies & Cream Pazookie, and it was HEAVENLY.  We left our server a large tip because he was excellent. The staff at the front were excellent as well.  Highly recommend this facility for all! It was a tad bit pricey, which is why I did 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall-- a wonderful experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land
Diana A.,"Houston, TX",71,328,346,3.0,11/11/2017,Better experience today than previously. Ordered tomatoes with mozzarella & clam chowder soup. Both were good.

Ema E.,"Houston, TX",177,82,4,4.0,10/28/2017,Best turkey burgers I have ever tasted.  Pizookies are SINFUL.  OMG. Best salad bar ever.  Great pizzas!!!! Large portions.

Nathan W.,"Austin, TX",325,64,143,4.0,6/25/2017,"If you've never had the pazookie, you haven't lived  Food: 3.5/5 There's a wide selection here. 75% of the time I go for the pizzas because they're great for sharing at a good price point. My dad always gets a chicken salad. Their chips and dip are a little disappointing, mainly because the chips are sometimes stale. But the deep dish pizzas are pretty solid. Crunch crust with a chewy, bready middle with plenty of toppings and Parmesan/chili flakes on the side. Can't go wrong with that.  If I was just eating their pazookies, it'd be 5/5. Those things are fresh and melt in your mouth. Chocolate chunk is your classic, but I really really love their monkey bread as well. It's AMAZING!!! Service: 4/5 Today we had a really awesome waiter, who I'm sorry I can't for the life of me remember his name. He was an older gentleman who calls himself the biggest clown in the restaurant, but he cracked jokes, made us feel welcome, and we loved him. Had a great experience! I don't think I've ever been disappointed with service. They're timely and attentive. Atmosphere: 4/5 It's clean, it feels a little classier than your typical dining experience with your darker ambience and wood furniture. There's a bar with sports on the tvs scattered around. A little something for everyone. Bathrooms: 3.5/5 Gendered communal bathrooms. Not dirty! Pretty standard, and they match the aesthetic of the restaurant. Price: 3/5 It depends what you get. I'll admit, a lot of their main dishes cost upwards of $12, which is a bit much for me. But like I said before, I always get the pizzas for sharing so I end up paying around $8-10 per meal. What's great is they always have a lot of deals going around (check their social media). Today we used a BOGO entree coupon from their Facebook as well as the Father's Day VIP card that gives 20% off every visit from when you pick it up on Father's Day to July 9. Pretty amazing if you ask me. I've been coming here more and more in the recent years, just because of their amazing deals. Makes it all worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land
Ray S.,"Houston, TX",294,298,2021,4.0,4/26/2017,"Walked in and the people here were very friendly. The place for lunch was not packed as expected it to be. I walked in and was seated. As I waited for my mother to arrive I ran into old friend so this visit is starting off good.  My mom and ordered the Tortillia soup; which was ok.. it needed more flavor/seasoning and it needed to be hot. I was disappointed. For lunch my mother ordered the Grilled Cheeses and I the Santa Fe Salad.  My mom's grilled cheeses was gooood and cheesy. The bread was toasted just right. All over!!! I know my mom ordered it but she's my mom so she gave me a bite. I wanted to take two but it was not my food.  My Asante Fe salad looked like a national treasure but I had to take it down. The blackened chicken was moist and plenteous in my salad. The avocado was cut in nice size chunks. The salad hosted plenty of all its ingredients. However, maybe too much corn. My mom was satisfied so I'm happy. Now my mom is a Yelper. She just befriended me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land
Allen T.,"Sugar Land, TX",2071,293,2546,2.0,1/2/2017,Saw a BOGO coupon for this place and decided to visit it after many years!  Now I know why I haven't been back. I guess a lot of people must have had the same coupon as there was a bit of a wait. By the time we were seated we were placed right in front of the kitchen doors. Not the best view but whatever.  What I found kind of annoying was how long it took before anyone came up to wait on us. Hmmmm not starting off well. I ordered my favorite drink an Arnold Palmer but once served found the drink way too tart!  Yuck!  Finally ordered!  Bummer was it took forever before the food arrived. Assessment?  Food was meh..certainly not worth what we paid. Glad I had a coupon.  Even with that it was meh at best.  Better choices in mom and pop joints. Food much better and so is the service. Guess it will be another 10 years before we go back.  Probably with another coupon!  Lol!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land
Walter A.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,9/9/2017,"Stupidity to the fullest, got there at 11 pm and walked out at 12:05 without food. The sever ordered the food (supposedly) and came back after 50 minutes asking my friend and I what we ordered again because the order didn't go  through, after that the manager talked to us and said that the food will be ready in 10 minutes max , and guess what they food was not still ready. We decided to walk out and we waited for more than an hour for them and they still didn't make right. This is not the way you treat people, customers service will keep your business rolling. I was very embarrassed because I took my friend there. Now I won't recommend anyone and i won't go back to that place.

Natalie T.,"Missouri City, TX",40,127,181,4.0,9/21/2017,"Came here on a Wednesday night for mid week date night but I was actually craving a burger. Long and behold the food gods must've heard my prayer because Wednesday night's is $10 loaded burger night with unlimited fries at BJs. It is a pretty good deal, considering the portions are pretty big....I was only able to finish half of my burger! Now I have visited this restuarant many many times in the past but this visit was very different. I was  truly impressed by both the quality of food AND enjoyed the great service.  (S/O to Raven for being so efficient yet friendly and nice).

Natalie R.,"Pearland, TX",3,17,12,1.0,6/22/2017,"My experience last night at this location was terrible. My server was Alexsandra B (that's the name on the receipt, she never actually introduced herself).  Let me start by saying my friends and I attend this restaurant often. The location is convenient for all of us and the pizookie is usually what gets us in, and the food is usually good too.  We went to the restaurant to catch up with each other. Our server was friendly but every time we wanted another drink or an appetizer we had to flag her down. She would constantly go to the tables on both sides of our booth and we would try to catch her when she dashed by. We finally caught her again when we were ready to order our meal.  We must have waited close to 40 minutes for our food. Please keep in mind that it was after 10 on a Wednesday night, so the place wasn't packed at all but somehow we continued to wait. Not once did the server come over to check on us, ask if anyone wanted another drink, or to give us an update on our food.  Finally one of the guys from the kitchen brings out our food. It was cold. Not cool, but actually cold. My friend ordered a pizza, she had to wait another 5 minutes for Alexsandra to bring her a plate. When my friend got the plate and grabbed a slice there was no gooey cheese coming up, her pizza was also cold. When the guy brought the pizza he brought it out with the pan carrier (that's used when the pizza is sizzling hot so they don't get burned) he could have just used his hands. This pan wasn't even warm. It seemed like the food was just sitting there in the back. If it's late night, and I assume you want to go home, wouldn't you get this food to the table asap? That's clearly not there logic.  Once again the server never came to check on how we were. We were annoyed by that point and my friend flagged her down for boxes and a pizookie. She paced around for a while, I believe at one point sitting at a booth on her phone. We got the check and soon left.  Fast forward to this morning, I woke up with diarrhea and vomiting everywhere. Haha! Guess who got food poisoning!  I'm beyond disappointed with my experience last night. Next time we good out I'll be sure to suggest a different restaurant. There are way to many awesome restaurants in this area, to settle for poor customer service and food that will get you sick. Please do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land

John L.,"Houston, TX",622,68,122,4.0,3/7/2017,"Visited here on a Thursday which has a full rack of ribs, 2 sides, a salad, and dessert for $18!  Be prepared for a wait, this place is always busy that you should probably order your food with your drinks to make sure you're not extremely hungry by the time your food is out.  Overall, the dish was good for the value. The meat on the ribs had a definite nice seasoning with the BBQ sauce.  If you're extremely hungry, get the full rack, if not, I'd suggest the half rack which was $12 or $13, it'll be a better value and you will be stuffed at the end of the course.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land

Barbie H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,1,1.0,8/22/2017,"Visiting from out of town and there were so many restaurants to choose from in Sugarland.  I reviewed the menu before choosing BJ's.  The restaurant was clean, well lit with a fun atmosphere.  We were seated promptly.  Our server was friendly.  The major problem with this restaurant was the most important thing - THE FOOD.  I had the bison burger and my guest had the chicken sandwich.  Our server recommend the chicken sandwich tossed in buffalo sauce so my guest took that option.  When the food came to the table our server asked him if the sandwich hand been tossed in buffalo sauce and she lifted up the bun herself!  So after putting her hands on his food and showing that it had been tossed in buffalo sauce, she said ""I don't think that's buffalo sauce"" even though it obviously was, and she took the sandwich away, returning moments later saying it was buffalo sauce.  Weird.  My burger was burned.  I was so hungry by that point I just ate the I burned parts.  The fries were also burned and drowned in a sea of salt, I guess to mask the burn taste.  Our server didn't even ask how our food was, which most servers do.  The food was horrible and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and I will never ever go back.  It makes the list for one of the worst places I've ever eaten.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=40

Nicole G.,"Houston, TX",113,296,153,4.0,10/14/2015,"After being put off by what I thought was mediocrity from another BJ's chain, I decided to give BJ's another try. There are a few things I really enjoy about this restaurant: 1) the deep dish pizza, 2) the Pizookies (OMG salted caramel), and 3) the fairly interesting selection of house beers. All three of those things happen to be their signature items. As an added bonus, 4) the menu is about 500 pages long, so it's group friendly as far as selection goes. They offer a selection of perhaps 10 different beer types, so you can generally find something that pairs well with your meal. Get a flight to sample your favs. My husband loves to start with the avocado egg rolls, which are basically avocado bites fried in egg roll wrapping and served up with a dipping sauce. (Personally, I prefer the potato skins.) The deep dish pizzas are unlike others I've tried - they're less pie-like and more pillowy, which I adore. My favorite is the Pepperoni Extreme, which has sliced, diced, & julienned pepperonis. A small (6 slice) can definitely feed two people; order a medium (8 slice) and you'll be taking home leftovers. And fiiiiinally...the Pizookies. Usually I don't order dessert, much less a cookie, but this....this is different. The warm, gooey, caramelized-on-the-outside Pizookie is to die for. The salted caramel flavor is my absolute favorite, but the triple chocolate and white chocolate Macadamia come in close behind. You can get a free mini on your birthday, too! I've had other items, like the burger and the deep dish ravioli (which is more like a lasagna baked in a pie-like pan), and they're solid. But they'll not why I keep returning. Besides that, I've gotten great service and I've had unbelievably slow service, and I've always been seated quickly. The next time I would like to spend all my calories in one sitting, I will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=40

Now as I sit here, I have to acknowledge that I did enjoy my meal each time I came here. The server I had, when I came with my family, was knowledgable and helpful in aiding both my cousin and myself in deciding what to have. She was friendly, and appeared eager to wait on us. I've already become friendly with some of the servers since I've become more of a regular here. The only reason I don't rate it a five star is because of one of the bartenders letting their stress of being busy show everywhere. However, that same bartender was still friendly and helpful. I've never had an issue with the food or its taste, and I do enjoy the service, so I recommend giving this place a try.

I am a BJ's Reward customer and introduced a coupon for free Pizookie and I showed it to my waitress and she took my info and said every thing was fine.

The coupon state that the dessert was free if I had a purchase of $9.95 or greater. My bill was over $20?   I had to call customer service to get my points reinstated.

After waiting for about 30 minutes, we were told the kitchen was backed up, but fortunately we were not ""hangry"" or in a rush. When my pizza finally arrived I noticed that the cheese was just barely melted on the top as I could still see shreds of it in certain spots.

Donna A.,"Manvel, TX",43,93,262,3.0,11/2/2016,"I like BJ's because it has a plethora of menu items that works out for everyone. For this lunch visit, I ordered the Chicken and Spinach Quinoa (those rare moments I actually order something ""healthy"") and wow it was amazing. And I don't even like quinoa! The texture and appearance just looks like little flour bugs, but because I wanted to be healthy, I shrugged it off and went ahead and ordered it. Whatever they cooked the quinoa in, chicken broth or whatever, made me forget about my thoughts of eating tiny little bugs! It was so flavorful! I loved the flavor of the chicken and the mushroom, tomatoes and spinach as well. I think they should add more of the veggies though especially if it's considered an ""enLIGHTened"" favorite, but perhaps it's because I ordered the lunch portion. Seating was quick, even exactly at 12pm. Waitress was nice, checked up on us a few times - average service.

First off, I went there last night, a Tuesday night, for dessert with my family to celebrate my birthday and when we called we were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait. We were literally 5 minutes away so we put our name down and decided to go wait there. When we arrived we were told it would be 20-30 minutes. We decided to leave and go somewhere else because it would be too long. As soon as we pulled out of the parking lot, we got a text message saying our table was ready. From calling the restaurant to arriving and then deciding to leave, it was a total of 15 minutes max. Basically, the ""wait time"" was very off and they lost customers.

Victoria E.,"Dallas, TX",103,186,293,1.0,6/20/2016,"I came in town from Dallas for the weekend some friends and I choose this location to watch game 7 of the NBA finals. We figured this would be a great place to grab some drinks at the bar and utilize one of their many screens within the restaurant. I started off by ordering a drink, one thing I did not like off the bat is that they do not list the prices for cocktails on the menu, which I'm definitely not a fan of. I prefer to know how much my item is going to cost and not be blind sided when my check comes. I ordered the Tickled Pink because of how tasty it looked on the menu. When I received my drink it looked nothing like the picture! There was no garnish and the fruit that was supposed to be in the drink was left out. When I tasted the drink it was disgusting as well so I sent it back and ordered the Strawberry Splash. The description described it to be a frozen Pina colada like drink with strawberry purée. Again disappointment, while the appearance this time was much better the texture was a let down. There were chunks of huge pieces of ice throughout my drink as if it was not mixed well in the machine to have that smooth frozen drink consistency. Plus I could not taste any alcohol, definite waste of $9. Definitely not worth the money I payed. Onto the food, I ordered the BJ's brewhouse burger with thin cut fries. It was honestly nothing to write home about, I have made better burgers at home. I did not like how greasy my burger patty was it tasted like grease when I bit into it.

So I express my non satisfaction with my server who was so kind about it. She calls the manager over and here's when I have an issue. I explained to the manager about my meal, he sits in my booth and begins to try and justify this shitty burger. ""Oh the batter must have fallen off"" ""oh this burger is just not my favorite"" ????? I tell him I'm not looking to send it back because I have to leave soon and he offers no compensation for it and it's not that I've eaten the thing.

Although reservations aren't allowed, they let us call 30 minutes prior to arrival to be added to the wait list. When we got here we waited barely 10 minutes! The place is packed with the weekend dinner rush so waiting 10 minutes is a win in my opinion. Our table was extremely sticky. Not a pleasant feeling.  It is good for large groups, lots of choices for everyone. Since the menu is endless, our waiter was helpful with recs. He was also attentive to refills for our drinks. I got the Chicken Parmesan per his recommendation. Substituted the broccoli for mixed vegetables. I was hoping it would at least be decent. I didn't finish the dish. It's extremely salty. I sampled other dishes (New Orleans Jambalaya and Clam Chowder). Both were also very salty. The fried calamari tasted old and over fried. With such an extensive menu from a chain restaurant, I expected quality would be subpar. Prices are pretty steep for the quality that you'll get. I mean it does tell you something when they give out promotions like ""$10 off $35"" deal.  They give free birthday pizookie. Best part of the meal! I've tried to replicate this at home cookie, but it's just not the same :(  There were a couple of pros (pizookie!) scattered throughout the experience so 3 stars from me.

Angelynn Á.,"Hartford, CT",216,89,305,4.0,5/18/2016,"I am happy with my few experiences at BJ's so far. The ambience of the restaurant is great since it gives off a casual and comfortable, yet classy feel. There is a huge variety in the menu---ranging from various flat breads pizza, deep-dish pizzas, burgers, tacos, seafood, and salads. Last time I was at BJ's, I ordered their bison burger, fries and cheese sauce, and a chocolate chip Pizookie for dessert. Their bison burger was good (though I must say i've had better bison burgers at actual burger restaurants, but that is to be expected). Their fries and cheese sauce was also a nice side to share. The cheese on the fries also had some spice added to it, which was a plus. My favorite part of my visits to BJ's is the dessert! I absolutely enjoy their Pizookie--which is a ""hot, out of the oven, rich and delicious, gluten-free cookie topped with  vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish."" It sounds simple, but it's truly an amazing way to end the meal. I like how there are several cookies you can choose from. So far I've tried the chocolate chip cookie, and the cookies 'n' cream cookie and they were both great! The Pizookies vary in size---meaning you can get a small-sized Pizookie (good for 1 person) with 1 ice cream scoop, or you can get the larger-sized Pizookie (good for 2+) where the cookie is larger in radius and comes with 2 scoops of ice cream. If a group/party wants to go out to eat but some members of the group crave different types of food, I would suggest BJ's to them since the menu covers a wide-variety of food. I would also recommend BJ's since their Pizookies are delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=80
Melissa G.,"Katy, TX",104,646,82,4.0,7/25/2015,"Yelp says I keep coming back and wants to know why.   Coming to BJ's is typically a group decision when I'm in Sugar Land.  So that is positive #1 - good for groups.  This last visit was a group of 10 and we only had to wait about 10 minutes.  They also didn't charge the typical group standard tip.  I don't know if that was a mistake or not. While it is good for groups in size, I would have to say our server was a bit slow. We were here rather late so maybe they let some of their staff go for the night by the time we got there. Why else would I choose BJ's?  They have a large menu with a nice variety of foods. So one person can get a burger, another person can get a salad and someone else could get pizzas.  They have alcoholic beverages and make their own cream soda and root beers. Location, location, location!  This spot has a couple of pluses location-wise.  There is a portal in reach and it is right by 59 and 6.  Our group usually consists of people from various parts of the greater Houston area and everyone can easily reach a freeway to get home from this location.   We got here at around 10 p.m. and the parking lot was still pretty packed.  There was still a short wait at this time, most likely because we were a large group.   This is the only BJ's I have visited.  Will I visit the one closer to home based on this location?  Sorry, but most likely not.  This is definitely a place for groups, families, or people who can't decide on a ""cuisine"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=80

The last time that we ate here the service was CATASTROPHICALLY POOR. We were IGNORED for 30 minutes before we got a glass of water, while other customers came in got their food, ate and left before we got our cold food . We finally got the manager to the table and she didn't appear to be too concerned that we were not happy. it took us 1.5 hours to eat. Complained to the manager again when we left and received the second dose of 'I don't give a shit' ATTITUDE. I left her with my crystal clear message that we WOULD NOT BE BACK!!! Wrote BJ's corporate when we got home, tagged it with a delivery receipt (it delivered) and NEVER received a reply.

Yeah I know, I'm short changing myself on the price of the meal but I don't like shrimp. Go put the order in! After all was said and done, the food was really good.

Had I not already been drinking vodka gimlets I certainly would have had a couple of those selections. And I do plan on going back for a few another time. If you like locally brewed beers and want to try some tastes, please stop by and sit at the bar for some here. They had large screen TVs and full menu service at the bar. The menu looked terrific. But because we were on our great clam chowder hunt that day we stuck to our plan and each ordered clam chowder. You can get it in a bread bowl or a regular bowl. It was fantastic! I really wasn't expecting it to be as it's kinda like a fancy Chili's or step sister of Houston's. Ya know? But it was rich cream and loaded with clams.

Also they did not tell that thing to us when we were waiting for that long. If we would have known about the arrangement, we would have gone to some other dinner place with a better customer service. I spoke to the manager Davis and the lady supervisor about joining the tables. Without even looking to see how many tables were available, the manager denied to seat us together. He had no reasoning to his answer as it was a weeknight and the place was pretty empty . We had people in our group coming from San Antonio and outside of the country. We told this to him and he was very much non accommodating! I went back to the staff and requested her to come with me to the area and see how many tables were empty! She did come with me and seat us together on one big table joining couple of them! May be the manager and supervisor needs to change positions with the serving staff. Our server was great too!

Once he was done, he took our orders w/ a smile & made great beer suggestion. I tried the Piranha, which is kind of a hoppy IPA. Pretty dang on good. The fact BJ's let's you have a sample of their specialty crafts is a bonus...in fact I think it's safe to say they encourage a trial run. Why let a customer order an entire pint, only to find they dislike it, then have to pour an entire serving down the drain??? Good marketing strategy IMO.  We also tried the Black & Blue Brewhouse Burger & also some of the corn & bacon fritters. The fritters were killer!!! The aioli sauce they come with has the perfect amount of spice.

Mia R.,"Hockley, TX",0,14,15,1.0,7/31/2016,"Let's just say the restaurant was nice. However, the service that was given to us was extremely poor. It was 8 of us that attended for the dinner. Our waiter name was Lawrence (Caucasian guy covered in tattoos). I'm not sure if he was having a hectic day, but he did not care for our table at all. When we ordered our food and drinks he acted as if we were all talking to him at one time. He will continue to say ""hold on , let me take everything down"".  This man never checked on our table to see if how our food was or to see if we needed anything else. Lawrence paid more attention to the table across from us. He would literally refill all their drinks quickly, constantly check on them. Maybe Lawrence wasn't in a good mood, because he would continuously walk past our table and give us a quick glimpse and did not say a word to us. My friend had to get the manager twice because we were not getting any assistance. Once the manger came to our table apologizing for her employee behavior. The manager was extremely nice she got all our tickets ready so that we can leave. Crazy thing is, Lawrence added extra drinks and food to our table bill. Once the manager was getting the ticket I have not received my food, at this point  it's been a whole hour. The manager was able to take my food off my ticket for the wait. This was probably the worst experience I have ever had at this restaurant. We will never come here again due to one employee treating his customers poorly. Mind you it was 8 of us , he defiantly missed out on a big tip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=160

My V.,"Houston, TX",173,17,28,2.0,7/17/2015,"""Maybe this time won't be as bad as last time..."" Nope. I've come here about five times over the past few months and each time has been SO disappointing. Horrible service and long waits for EVERYTHING. I understand that they're one of the more popular places in the Sugar Land area (especially since it's so close to Town Center and the mall), but goodness...if you're gonna make your guests wait so long for a table, at least give them good service. Servers always take around 10 minutes to come greet you and take your drink order. After that, it takes another 10-15 minutes just to get your drink (I ordered a water each time). The last time I went, I ordered a strawberry mojito and it took 20 minutes to come. I get that the bar can be a bit hectic but keep in mind that this was a Tuesday night and the place wasn't that packed. Then, as soon as our server drops our drinks off, they're gone. GONE. I always have to flag down my server just so I can put in my food order. So beware - it will take you approximately 20-30 minutes before you can actually order your food. Then after we were done eating and ready to go, the server was nowhere to be found. After about 10 minutes, she showed up and we asked her to split it since we were all paying separately. All we ordered were 3 waters, 3 drinks from the bar, and 2 desserts...yet it took forever for her to bring the checks to us, forever to pick up our checks after we put our cards/money in there, and forever for her to bring it back for us to sign. I don't suggest coming here if you're looking for a quick meal AT ALL. Now the food...their pizookies are absolutely DELICIOUS. I've tried almost every one and have loved them all! Their appetizers and main dishes are all pretty tasty too! Don't get the fried beignet though, it's not that great. I was expecting it to be similar to fried ice cream, but it just tasted like a cinnamon bun.

Vincent N.,"Sugar Land, TX",174,32,25,2.0,7/18/2015,Bj's is much better than before. But still not what I expect from these types of restaurants. First our server is still slow. Got here at 10:00pm and he only has 4 tables to serve. Restaurant has a good amount of people here though. And it's been hard to find him. Other thing is the need to pay more attention to the restroom. The trash is over flowing with paper on the floor in the restroom. Lastly there is still a 15 min wait at 10 pm. With at least 15 tables open. Never had to wait at any other restaurants open this late. Food is still good though. Love the new menu. Now let me add one more thing. Only a table of 2! I am waiting for 10 min since I asked for the check! I have my rewards so I am waiting for him just to apply it so I can pay on my phone!! It has been 10 min!!

My girlfriend and I went at an odd time during the day when they weren't very busy so the service was good and we received plenty of attention from the waiter.  We ordered Thai Wontons, Buffalo Wontons, flat bread pizza and Thai lettuce wraps. The buffalo wontons with the dipping sauce taste exactly like buffalo wings from Buffalo Wild Wings or any place else that has the traditional buffalo sauce. Thai wontons and Thai lettuce wraps were the business. A nice sweet sauce with just the right amount of spice. The wraps had shrimp that was cooked quite nicely. The flatbread wasn't anything to brag about and I wouldn't get it again. I think it needed more sauce. So next time maybe I'll try a deep dish or traditional pizza.

It is a huge restaurant with a bar that has tons of tv screens to watch games, as well as a huge dining area for large groups to sit.  The service is a bit on or off here. Sometimes I get a great server and other times, I get an extremely lousy one. This is the only part of this place that I wish they would change.  In terms of the food, it is huge portions, very similarly to the CHeese Cake Factory. They have great hamburgers and the choice between thin and wedge fries (go wedge!). The pizza is really good too although the deep dish isn't real deep dish pizza (I went to school in Chicago haha) And of course, they are known for their pizookie desserts which are cookies baked in pans and topped with ice cream and whipped cream. Usually they are too sweet for me but if you get the Oreo one, it is actually quite well balanced. Specifically, the jalapeño burger is amazing and the spicy meatball deep dish pizza has crust that I will actually at. Perfection!

Melanie L.,"Houston, TX",183,116,1378,5.0,10/9/2011,"Haha. BJs. Sorry just had to throw that in there. You definitely get your money's worth here. The dishes are just about as pricey as any other restaurant, yet you get some pretty generous portions. I don't see what's not to love about this place. It's a great place to have lunch with coworkers, catch up with friends, dinner with the family, etc. (yes family, even though it's a brewhouse too).  It's open til midnight so you have a place to go when most other restaurants close at like 9-10pm. The staff is very attentive, especially one of our waitresses, I think her name was Vicky? She was so sweet and funny; she really made us feel welcome there. Even the manager (I presume) consistently came up to tables and asked how everyone's visit/food is. I really appreciate that.  The variety of things they have on their menu, from drinks to food to desserts, is great. The first few pages of their menu is nothing but beer, and I think BJ's has their own beer for their restaurant. They have lighter options, gluten free items and vegetarian items too! It's like there's a little something for everyone here. There's so many things I wanna try out here, but must do with future visits. As of right now, I've had the ahi poke (tuna, green onions, and avocado w/ wonton chips), spinach stuffed mushrooms, and angus beef sliders as appetizers, and the california burger (has avocado, green chilies, and pepper jack cheese on it) and parmesan crusted chicken (comes w/ mashed potatoes and broccoli) as entrees. I haven't found anything I haven't liked yet! Must try the flatbread pizzas, gourmet mac&cheese, and avocado egg rolls. And for dessert, it's soooo good it has to have its own section in my review. As I'm sure others have already mentioned: GET THE PIZOOKIE! The cookie itself comes in different flavors such as chocolate chunk, oatmeal raisin, white chocolate macadamia nut, cookies&creme, and red velvet. Yes I said it. A red velvet cookie with ice cream on top. During my last visit, I decided I had to try one of those, but my friends all wanted a different flavor. So we agreed on ordering the pizookie trio, which is a sampler of your choice of 3 pizookies. We chose red velvet, white macadamia nut, and chocolate chunk. Each one was so good, my mind was blown. So good that pizookies have now become one of my favorite desserts. Overall: great ambiance, great service, great food. Great everything.

I ordered the Turkey burger (good) bc I really wanted the wedge fries but it came out with regular fries instead. (Deeply disappointed).

He would give his burger half a star. Our waitress (Megan) was rude and always in a rush and never attentive. She gave us menus and right away asked if we wanted to order appetizers.

May I say that this experience was 150 times better than it has Ever been. I'm sorry for ever doubting you. I tried the Piranha Pale Ale at first which has an awesome name and the beer itself had great color but way too much sweet flavor which isn't necessarily wrong but not what I was looking for. No worries. I next tried the Hopstorm IPA. Much much more of what I was thinking and looking for. I ordered the Avocado rolls, the Root beer ribs, and some peppered boneless wings. All were incredibly delicious. The beer and the food never bothered me about this place before. It was the service. This time I saw 2 managers and both of them were extremely polite and made themselves present which I feel sets a great example. My server John F. was also awesome in more ways that one. Even though I could tell he was busy, he made great suggestions and never seemed stressed or frustrated. I understand too well how things can go from hero to zero in a stressful work environment.

Tam M.,"Missouri City, TX",359,584,614,2.0,12/16/2013,"Only been to BJ's twice and my verdict is that's it over-hyped--Yep you heard right!!!! What's my complaint?  Just sit tight while I summarize my not-so-dynamite-bite: Although seating before 7 on a Friday was no hassle, the wait staff was getting hammered!!!! Everywhere I looked, the staff was briskly going from table to table trying to compliment guests and get orders out. However, going to the wrong table with an order defeats that gesture! Could it be that they got the order wrong because he or she doesn't use a notepad?!  At least in my instance it was because I receive an incorrect order not once, but TWICE!   The first order omitted my  request to add Blackened Shrimp to my Angel Hair Toscana, which looked like baby food. Poorly presented on plate with globs of angel hair and a few pieces of tomato sprawled onto the plate with dashes of olive oil. Not appetizing at all. Although the server apologized for the omission, I learned from one of my friend's mamas that you don't eat ugly food--and that Toscana was U-G-L-Y it had no alibi to be eaten for the price, so I sent it back and downgraded my purchase to a simple BJ Burger  with Bacon that my friend had ordered. Her burger looked decent and the steak fries she allowed my eat to keep my stomach from growling had a nice crispy golden crust that I appreciated, but  once my plate arrived, I was not impressed. Once again, the presentation was off for me: the meat patty was sliding to one side with a pillow rather than a bed of lettuce peeking out from the side. Other veggies looked smooshed under the bun. At this point, I wished I had convinced my friend to go to Smashburger across the street versus this massacre of fine ingredients that were being ill presented on this particular evening. Despite the sub par impression of my plate, my stomach had other desires--and that was to eat, so I decided to keep the burger and taste it. Nonetheless, my server had neglected to write down my request for mustard and burger sauce on the side. I received the ""burger sauce"" which was simply a BJ version of Big Mac sauce that was an epic failure. Secondly, I received mayonnaise instead of mustard, which further delayed me from eating my burger. By the time we flagged down our server, my burger was not hot, but at this point, I didn't care to send another entree back. I dealt with it and decided that my tip would demonstrate my dissatisfaction.   Really was town on giving my server a tip with so many errors. I parted with one dollar for a near $12 purchase since the change from my transaction was not given back to me. Although I am finicky, I do tip when I dine out because I sympathize with server wages, BUT crappy and inconsistent wait service should not automatically receive a tip. When you're almost tempted to ask to adjacent table for condiments because you cannot get a waiter's attention, I think the waiter staff needs help pronto!  Until then, BJ's gets the thumbs down and a  better luck next time if I decide to give them another chance in the future. Maybe their special spirits is tops, but their service as restaurant is not!

Erin D.,"Houston, TX",14,905,882,4.0,3/24/2011,"I really like this restaurant. I've been here twice in the last week for lunch due to its cheap prices. For $6, where else can you get a salad and a deep dish pizza (about 5-6in in diameter and 2in deep) at lunchtime? Both are decently tasting, and you can't complain too much for the price, especially since you'd pay about the same amount for a McDonald's ""extra value"" meal. I've also ordered the gourmet mac and cheese for curbside pickup. This location doesn't have dedicated parking spots for curbside pickup (like Chili's), but they will still come out to your car once you call. The mac and cheese alone didn't fill me up for lunch though, but it was cheap ($4.32 including tax). The mac and cheese are okay with bacon on top. It could use more salt and more cheese, like velveeta. Also, note macaroni isn't used; spiral pasta is used instead. Many moons ago I came here for dinner. Someone ordered an appetizers of nachos, which were ennormous. I ordered the baby back ribs, which comes with a BOWL of soup and baked potato. By the time I finished the nachos and huge bowl of clam chowder, I was full. I ended up taking the ribs and potato to-go; the poor waiter thought I didn't like the food, since I asked for the box before I started eating! So, even though the ribs were $18, it included a lot of food with huge portions, and I managed to make 5 meals out of it.

The past few times my husband and I have been there our tables were not clean (crusted on food, wet drink rings, etc). I know they are trying to get everyone seated quickly, but I've noticed that when one couple leaves, a guy takes a wet rag does a quick wipe and then we are seated. Then there is still food and the table is sticky/wet.  I can't complain too much about the food because it is usually pretty good. The waiters and waitresses not so great.. Not attentive to getting drinks or refills or even getting to the table in a timely manner after you are seated.

The restaurant offers a wide variety of foods, but the real winner is their pizza's. Sugar Land has a lot of great places to get a New York style pizza, but for deep dish lovers there just isn't as many options.  The staff is always friendly but they do take a long time to get the food out to you even when they're not busy. The real selling point is the pizzokies which is under cooked cookie dough with ice cream on top. It's something anyone can make at home, but who doesn't love being waited on.

We were the only large party there at the time. We got our drinks in a timely manner and three other large parties showed up. It took nearly an hour for us to able able to order our meals. The other three large parties got their meals before us. One of the people in our group didn't even get their food and eventually the manager gave it to her to-go. It took 45 minutes for our cards to be processed. During this time the other three parties got their desserts and checks and left. Once we got the checks back we were STILL waiting on our dessert. We asked for it to be taken off of our checks. We wanted to go home. It took ANOTHER 30 MINUTES to get our checks back. They tried to appease us with small coupons for a free pazookie AFTER you but a $10 entree. Pathetic. The waiter was working hard, but towards the end I get like he just gave up trying for us. Especially after every other large party had left and the restaurant was nearly empty. I didn't even want to ask for a to go box in fear of how long that would take.

Then in explaining the pumpkin spice pazooki, he told us it tastes like pumpkin pie. Um, no. Then when the bill came out we asked if he could take off the ahi tuna from the salad, so he halfed the price of the salad, but blamed the fact that he wasnt happy with the ahi tuna on him and not wanting another serving of it.

He was easy to talk to and helped my boyfriend order since it was his first time. Great guy! Appetizers: you have to try the mini bruschetta or the avocado egg rolls. Or both, do whatcha want. TO DIE FOR.  I'm also slightly obsessed with soup in bread bowls... and BJ's tomato bisque in a sourdough bread bowl is absolutely drool worthy.  Lastly, I love love love places that will substitute meat. For you vegetarians out there, get the California burger and ask for a veggie patty instead. You won't regret it!

I've never had good service (on our last trip I told a manager to get our server some help - while he was a nice guy he was clearly in over his head.) Trying to get a refill on a drink or getting the right order out of the kitchen is more than their waitstaff can apparently handle. Food is mediocre.

Miranda T.,"Houston, TX",261,70,271,2.0,5/29/2014,"I have been to other BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse locations, and though my experience wasn't ever spectacular, it was at least decent. What was really lacking here was the food. Honestly, I do not expect much from chain restaurants, but this BJ's set a new standard of low for me.  We decided to dine here for my friend's birthday dinner. The birthday girl ordered a vegetarian angel hair pasta, I ordered the Hawaiian mahi-mahi, and another friend ordered the crispy jalapeño burger. -The angel hair came out bland, mushy, and way over cooked. Sadly, there was also a piece of CHICKEN that my VEGETARIAN friend found in her pasta.  -The mahi-mahi tasted like old, microwaved fish, and the bed of rice it came over was excessively greasy. My friend initially thought the slab of fish was a piece of bread. That is how dry and over cooked the mahi-mahi was. Honestly, it was disgusting. I have never had a problem with this dish before at other locations. I even thought I was being safe by ordering it tonight, but I guess not.  -The burger was HUGE. Our friend said he enjoyed it. I sampled some of his crispy fries and thought they were pretty good! Thankfully, the waitress was nice enough to allow the birthday girl to replace her entree. Since burgers seemed like the only thing they could get right, she got a vegetarian burger instead. She said it was much better than her pasta. If you have to come here, I would suggest sticking to their pizzas or burgers, but in regards to any of their other dishes, just do yourself a favor and stay away.

Jenny L.,"Houston, TX",30,27,9,1.0,10/4/2013,"Me and my friends decided to come here to relax after the end of another work week. We really like the food especially the pizookies, too bad the service was subpar this evening.  We like getting our dessert first so me and my friend ordered a mini pizookie. We got them in a timely manner but when it came to our entree...not so much. We aren't the type to complain so we patiently wait. Thirty minutes go by, still no food and absolutely no attention from the waiter or management. Forty-five minutes go by, still no food and still no one came by to give an update on our order. We finally have to flag down the waiter, Emory, and he says he just spoke to the manager and our food should be on our way.  Finally after an hour, we get our food by the manager Stephen and I ask what happened to our order. He says he had no idea and barely found out of the situation. Really? I thought the waiter had informed him of the situation. So we flag down yet another manager, Rene, and ask him what happened to our order. He has no clue as well but said he would come back to let us know.  So we have our food but empty waters and no condiments. So I literally have to walk up to Rene who was standing at the hostess stand to make the request because everyone just stopped coming by our table.  So at this point we had our food an hour delayed, no attention from managers or the waiter, no explanation, no water, & no condiments. We were very agitated so I flagged Rene down to get an explanation. Remind you, he was supposed to come back with an explanation but he was too busy playing hostess instead of being a manager. He rather chose to ignore us like everyone else until we confronted him. He finally admits the the ticket was lost in the kitchen and that's why our food was so late coming out. I get it, mistakes happen but it's the way that they are handled that rectifies the situation. The fact that we were practically ignored is where the dissatisfaction in service came from. If they had come to our table 20 minutes after us not receiving our food and explained the situation, I would not be writing such a negative review right now. Unfortunately, they decided to ignore us and that was not acceptable.  BJ's as a company needs to learn how to train their employees on customer service. After all they are in the restaurant industry which is based on customer satisfaction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=180
Maithili B.,"Houston, TX",175,73,93,3.0,5/4/2015,"Went here with my fam bam on a whim. The starters were perfect! We got the spinach artichoke dip and the mediterranean flat bread pizza. Both tasted deliciously unhealthy, I particularly liked the addition of goat cheese to the pizza.  For main course, I got the angel hair pasta with broccoli, sundried tomatoes and garlic. The pasta was completely lacking in taste. I felt like I was basically eating boiled pasta with some veggies thrown in. I used up half a jar of chili flakes to add flavor to the pasta if that's any indication of how bad it was. My aunt asked for two chicken tacos without any lettuce and she literally got two soft tortillas with just the chicken. There were no red onions, cilantro, tomatoes or any additional filling like the menu had promised. When we asked the waiter if he misunderstood, he said that the filling is prepared with lettuce beforehand, so that's why the tacos only contained chicken. We would have appreciated knowing  beforehand. For desserts, we got the chocolate chunk pizzokie and ohmygoodness, all of us were clamoring for it. It was a battleground with four spoons clashing for the chocolate chips.  Service-6/10. Initially our server was pretty fast but as the evening progressed, he took 15-20 minutes to come to our table. I wouldn't have been too frustrated if it wasn't for the fact that we called out to 4 or 5 servers, all of whom promised to get our server but never did anything.  Ambience-8/10. There were ants everywhere on the first table we were offered, which made me question the hygiene levels. However, we were given another table without any fuss pretty quickly. The rest of the restaurant is pretty cool. I liked that there were TVs everywhere showing different sports. God knows, my family can't eat without watching basketball/baseball/hockey/football/soccer/cricket/tennis and even golf (I know, how does anyone watch golf patiently?)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=180

The servers are great but not stellar. They're good about topping up drinks, updating you on the status of your meal and making sure the food is okay once you receive it. For an appetizer, the santa fe spring rolls are a great choice for sharing with another person. They come with 2 sauces, both are delicious.  As far as entrees goes, I love the pizza there so I usually stick to it. The buffalo chicken deep dish pizza is absolutely amazing and never disappointing. A small can feed 2 people so keep that in mind. I've also tried the flatbread version of this pizza and it's just as good.  For dessert, a pazookie is a MUST.

The service was attentive without being intrusive, there was a good vibe, another table had the brew sampler, and discussion was to be had.  Let me quantify, FOR Sugar Land, I'll take BJ's over Cheesecake Factory or Olive Garden for a non-drive through dining experience. Everything fresh, ""Chef Mic"" microwave is not ""cooking"" my meal.   If you want your socks knocked off you're going to have to drive in to town, Montrose or the Heights. For good food that honestly is not more expensive than say that abomination known as Red Lobster or any other chain out here that if you have friends, family to take out, or just didn't want to cook, it's a good option. as for the name, Lauren get your mind out of the gutter or stick just to the dark bars *LOL* some of us do not want ""rock and roll"" all the time!! Sorry I couldn't resist. To each his own and I could see that BJ's is not what the younger partying crowd would be drawn to nor do I think that's the type of business BJ's is vying for and that's what it's all about, attracting people with the disposable income to keep them in business.

I liked the creation that my boyfriend made: it was a pizza with pesto sauce (hand tossed and sharable), with cilantro, mushrooms, seasoned tomatoes,... I really forgot but we just put the toppings from the ""build your own part of the menu"" (more veggies no meats), and we built it that way. I liked it.

I suppose I can overlook the wait since it was busy for a Wednesday night, but it is summer so we just seated ourselves at the bar area. We ordered our pizookies and beignet and specified that we didn't want caramel on the beignet that we ordered. It took us a while to get our dessert. And when we got it, the order was right, except for the caramel.  That just sucked. We told the waiter and the manager and all we got was cursory ""I'm sorry that happened"" in return.

They must not know what a deep dish pizza is because it was ALL DOUGH...very fluffy and light (and ok, fairly yummy) dough...with like 4 tiny pieces of topping and maybe a table spoon total of cheese (you could SEE the dough on top of the pizza due to lack of sauce/cheese). That is NOT a deep dish pizza. Putting it in a deep pan doesnt automatically make it a 'deep dish pizza'.

Marco C.,"Austin, TX",135,258,38,2.0,6/22/2012,"I've always liked this place back in high school (4 years ago). I hadn't been here recently, so I didn't understand the low ratings.....until now.  After being seated, we told the waitress we needed a few more minutes to think through what we wanted to order. It took her 10 minutes to come back. BJ's was NOT busy at 10pm.  My friend and I ordered two beers, and it took 20-25 minutes for us to get them. Too long. BJs, were you guys busy brewing the beer? After paying, our table should've received $5 in change in total. We felt cheated, but we thought the money went to the tip. (None of us told her to keep the change.) Afterwards, the waitress took the receipt booklets cause we had finished with them, but then she brought the booklets back so we could tip. What? Where did all the money that you took from us go?  Later, the waitress told us that they don't get paid a lot and would appreciate tip. Now, I completely understand that, and I'm actually pretty generous when I tip, but when a) the service is ridiculously slow and b) you don't return our table's change, do you honestly expect us to tip more? Based on what we ordered, the $5 was already more than what was expected of us to tip. I wanted to be nice, but I couldn't sympathize.  Should be one star; keeping at two because I've had positive experiences in the past. The beer wasn't bad, and I enjoy the atmosphere. My friends and I still had a good time.

It includes 2 appetizers, 1 medium pizza and a pazookie. The dessert is regular size, so expect to get your belly filled up fast!

Lauren T.,"Houston, TX",41,124,7,2.0,10/20/2012,"This place is weird. For one, it's called ""BJ's."" It is an extremely bright bar (to the point that it hurts your eyes) and it is extremely quiet. It's like a library in there! We had a late dinner/snacks on a Friday night. While crowded, the decibel level must have been the lowest I have ever heard in a room full of drunk people. BJ's brews their own beer and makes their own sodas, so maybe it's something in the beverages that keep people calm and sedate. The decor is equally weird--industrial corrugated metal accents and booths upholstered with fabric from tapestry vests circa 1990. Hurts my brain! The night of our visit we waited over ten minutes to be given menus or a greeting, even though we were seated right by the hostess stand. The waitress kept mixing up who ordered what and all of the food was obviously frozen and reheated as it came out at all different intervals. I was near the kitchen and could hear the chorus of microwave beepers going off. It's like the food you get at TGI Friday's or Chili's--corporate, processed ""product"" that was likely driven there in an 18 wheeler. Like, you could buy it boxed up at the store and make it yourself at home.  The prices for everything are pretty outrageous for mediocre-at-best food. $11 for avocado egg rolls (bland--needed salt), $5 for four tiny squares of bruschetta that equaled one breadstick, bland but well-fried mozzarella sticks for $8, and stuffed mushrooms for $8 that were really small button mushroom caps. Kind of disappointing. Equally disappointing was the beer itself. One of my dining companions ordered a beer that tasted like it had sat in a metal tank for days. It was disgusting and had a foul smell. My hubby got the berry cider, which tasted pretty good. My beer was nothing to write home about--average at best.  Not worth a special trip unless you would like to take in its weirdness. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=220

They ALWAYS look like they're waiting for someone to put them out of their misery. After they reluctantly see you to your table you're forced to wait 10 minutes to see your server for the first time.

I know I certainly will. I love their loaded baked potatoes and their southern fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and onion straws. Oh, and the pizzas. And the wontons. And the pizookies, naturally. There's something for everyone - and there's a wide variety of brews to enjoy, if that's your jam.  We come here for dinner, which almost always means a wait for a table, but we recently came around 2:30 and had almost the whole place to ourselves. The service is okay to good during the day - our drinks were never empty (although they got close!) and our food was well-paced, from appetizers to the meal. We did have a lengthy wait for our pizookies, but maybe that was meant to be a sign we shouldn't be ordering cookies. ;)  At night, you'll wait a little longer for service, but I've not had an actual bad experience. I do, however, think that BJ's could step it up a bit with the service times, hence the missing star.

The guys that came up with the idea of BJ's made it as inviting as any warm lodge on a snowy day. Nice interior with plenty of seating, great food/snacks, huge TV's with sports and even make their own beer!  Foods: Pizza- Great small pieces perfect for the HH, and just small enough to not easily get knocked out of your hands or make a mess. A Avacado egg rolls- While this is the same stuff served at multiple bars/grills in town, I'm sure I have shamed my Asian heritage for being too weak to resist this. A Beers- I had all of it, they have samplers and full sizes. Great stuff, you can really dial in on what you like. And it's the middle ones in-case anyone wants to buy me a few pints.

Joseph C.,"Houston, TX",0,40,3,2.0,8/31/2014,"So apparently, BJ's is known for their pizzas but I really am not sure why. The pizza's are very mediocre. Decided to give this place a visit since they seem to have a great following but ended up being rather dissapointed. Honestly, big name pizza chains are way better. I ordered their deep dish pizza. To start off, their deep dish is not a Chitown deep dish pizza where you get a relatively thin, buttery/flaky crust and loaded with toppings. BJ's deep dish is like a thick fluffy, white bread crust with some toppings layered over it. The crust lacked the bite and chew you'd expect pizza crusts from pretty much every other pizza place in the world to have. The toppings were pretty generic and lukewarm; edible but nothing special. To put it plainly, eating a BJ's deep dish pizza is like eating a Subway sandwich that's pretending to be a pizza and that's far from a compliment. Zero stars for their ""pizza"". Service was slow and unattentive.  The restaurant has a cool vibe. Spacious, with beer and lots of screens to watch sports on. One star for the cool vibes. Ended the meal with the pizookie trio sampler. The pizookies was pretty good. One more star. Two stars overall. Would only come back for pizookies and beer.

She then goes to the back with the plate in one hand and the other folks menus in the other. Still don't have a new salad. Manager comes over and apologizes after I told him what happened. He said he would take care of my lunch and apologized again. Next I get a check from the waitress with a uniformed military discount. What a joke. My whole lunch was $7.75! originally.

We checked in with the 4 people working up front (we had to wait for them to stop chatting to help us) and then waited for 15 minutes only to be seated at the table that had been empty since we walked in. The gentleman that seated us didn't offer to get our drink order, but rather abruptly turned and jogged back to the front to continue his conversation. 15 minutes later no one had taken our drink order and we were getting ready to just leave when our waitress walked by and informed us that she would be with us in ""2 minutes.""  Evidently I glared hard enough at her to get her moving, because less than 2 minutes later a different gentleman rushed over and took our drink and food order. Our drinks showed up 5 minutes later (although I wasn't able to get any sweetener from anyone until after our food finally came). The rest of the visit was just mediocre. I had the Ahi Tuna and the Santa Fe Spring Rolls, both of which were decent. My husband had the Post Roast. The meat and potatoes were good, but none of the vegetables were cooked all the way. In fact, we were pretty sure they tossed a raw onion in the mix for some reason. We stared at it for a bit and laughed it off.  So... yeah. We won't be returning.

Melissa M.,"Houston, TX",175,1391,4254,2.0,8/4/2009,"Oh where to start?  We got there around 2pm today for a late lunch.  Seated promptly.  Drinks served.  Had to ask for silverware.  Ordered... everything seemed fine... Then my salad came with nuts on it (that I specifically asked to not be included as I can't stand any nuts).  The server took it away and brought it back after a while without nuts. My dad ordered chives on his baked potato, but they were missing.  He doesn't like to make a fuss about anything so he decided to eat it chiveless. Ok, so no big deal, right?  I agree.  Kitchens mess up.   Ok, so I'm eating my salad and then when I'm almost done I find a long (6 inches) piece of plastic in my salad.  It's thin like cellophane (maybe the wrapping on the lettuce?).  I finally track down my waitress (who has gotten harder and harder to find even though the restaurant is only about 10% full).  It's in my salad bowl and she puts her hand into the salad and takes it off the bowl.  She doesn't ask, she just reaches in.  Well, I was eating the salad, but not anymore (I figured, I'd eaten most of the salad, I might as well finish it, plastic or not).  She walks away without a 'sorry about that' or anything.  She is gone a long time and finally comes back and said the manager (who I didn't ask for) has been in an interview and she'll talk to him as soon as she can.  Ok, fine by me.  I do think it's appropriate when people find foreign objects in their food that a manager visits their table.  I was fine with waiting as a third person joined us a little later and was still eating.  Well, the manager never comes by.  I see him leave his interview and he proceeds to just stand around at the hostess desk chatting with the employees (he definitely didn't look busy).  The waitress comps our meal (which I also didn't request but would expect).  Ok, fine, but shouldn't the manager come over?  Shouldn't the waitress apologize for the plastic?   while all this is going on, my friend and I decided we wanted to share a dessert.  Our waitress had been M.I.A. for a while now, so we asked another server for a menu but never got it. We asked a second server and she brought us a menu but didn't take the order.  Finally after about 10 minutes, we were able to order dessert.  If a restaurant is busy, I can understand it.  But seriously, by this time it's almost 3pm on a Tuesday.  The place is almost empty.  It appears to be about a 1 server per table ratio.  Why is the service so slow and unresponsive? This place was already not my favorite in Sugar Land because they serve Pepsi *barf* product, but I can survive on Iced Tea.  But with service like this (server and manager) I don't know that I'll be back soon. I think the food is good.  Not 'wow' unbelievable, but definitely solid good food.  I think they need to step up the service.  If a manager reads this, please always visit a table if plastic or other items are found in the patron's food, especially during non-peak times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=260

Justin P.,"Houston, TX",67,11,8,3.0,5/19/2013,"An establishment that is fairly representative of American pub fare and culture. While there are certain items that fall off the mark, there are certainly others that exceed expectations. Overall, an enjoyable option for dining if one were to decide on a restaurant that serves all manners of American bar food. I have recently just started frequenting the BJ's chain so I cannot vouch for all the food options that they offer. They do, however, have some outstanding items on the menu. They also offer locally-made in-house soda (root beer and cream soda) along with varieties of craft beer. A word of caution though - the menu is quite large and expansive. You will feel a little overwhelmed if you are not craving anything in particular. Of the items I have tried, I was thoroughly impressed with the gourmet mac and cheese. The subtle adjustments that they have made with the cheese composition along with the addition of the right amount of bacon and bread crumbs is sublime. The Chicken Fried Steak is also noteworthy. It is properly executed with the right amount of breading and seasoning and the sawmill gravy that is paired with the steak has just the right amount of salt and pepper. The deep dish pizzas are also worthy of a try. They have the right balance of airiness and crunch and the quality of the toppings is excellent. The dough also has a distinct sweetness to it that generally lends well to the flavors and saltiness in the toppings. The burgers do leave something to  be desired. They are good but nothing exceptional. I wish they were better. I do appreciate the option of choosing either wedge-cut and frenched fries as I prefer my fries a little thicker. The in-house root beer and cream sodas are also worth a try. If you are a fan of either and can afford the extra calories, be sure to give it a go. Refills are also included. One thing that I do have an issue with is the pricing of some menu items. More often than not, I find myself questioning the value of the food that I have ordered. While the restaurant certainly isn't exorbitantly priced, I feel that some items are a lot more expensive than they should be. I also find the service in this specific location a little lacking. While bar service is impeccable, the table service does leave something to be desired. All in all, this restaurant chain is definitely worth a try.

We ordered our beers and the pizookie trios and they took forever. We were sipping on our beer for around 30 minutes before the pizookies came out. We soon realized why it was in there for so long. First off, the presentation of these desserts always impressed me. They always looked so appetizing. We got the red velvet, cookies n' cream, and triple chocolate. What I remember about pizookies is that they come out the perfect amount of soft and gooey and this combination with the cold scoop of ice cream on top made a delicious rendezvous in your mouth. This was not the case on this visit, as almost all three of them were over-baked and hard. My friend and I literally had to shove our spoons into them at a 90 degree angle just to be able to dig a little big of cookie each attempt. This was a sad meal, but fortunately, I know that pizookies have seen better days and will probably return again in the future. On a side note, beer does not really go good with these desserts. It just seemed like the only appropriate thing to order while we sat at the bar and waited.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=240
Ashley B.,"Houston, TX",14,83,31,4.0,3/27/2014,"If you are going to drink beer, drink something that has some taste, not the mass produced swill that comes from the giant breweries in America.  That's always been my attitude towards beer, and that's why I am always ready to try out a different brewhouse. BJ's turned out to be an excellent choice for both beer and food.  I stopped by here a few afternoons ago on the way home from work for a bite to eat and a drink.  Once I settled in at the bar with a menu and a clear view of the happy hour list on the wall I decided I wanted a burger and a hefeweizen.  The pizza menu is extensive here but I've had so much pizza recently that I just wasn't in the mood for more.  Some of the fish also sounded good, but again I've had my fill of fish recently.  I settled on a brewhouse burger with bacon and cheese, because frankly this little girl doesn't need a 1/2 pound of burger on top of fries and a pint of beer.  The hefeweizen was the harvest blend brewed by the restaurant served in a chilled pilsner glass.  I opted for the thin and crispy fries as a side to my burger. My food and drink were quite good without being great.  Highlights included fresh cooked bacon that wasn't overdone (something all to common in my experience), gooey cheddar cheese with bite, a fresh Parmesan crusted bun, fries that weren't under or over salted and meat that tasted excellent.  I do wish that the patty had held together a little better, it tended to break apart as I handled and ate it, and I think I'm going to skip the rabbit food if I get it again.  There was just too much lettuce and tomato on this burger.  I should have asked them to bring me some mustard along with the ketchup as well.  Thank God they don't try to put mayo on a burger though.  The beer had a nice flavor and went well with the burger.  It wasn't OMG nectar of the Gods good but I would definitely order it a second time.  My service was prompt, friendly and helpful.  The bartender was attentive and knowledgeable about her product, and had a kind word for a girl just out of a hard day at work.  The decor of the restaurant was pleasant, well maintained and attractive.  It was a tad noisy inside but it seems like most restaurants are these days. The best thing about BJs came at the end of my meal.  I'm talking about the check, and I'm talking about it because it was so small.  A satisfying burger and fries, with a quality microbrewed pint for less then $15 including tip, where else can I find that?  This place has value written all over it, and it is definitely on my list of restaurants worthy of a return visit.  Good food and beer at a great price in a classy looking environment is a winning combination in my book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=240

We had artichoke dip which wasn't anything special. It didn't have a lot of flavor. The chips were stale a little. The mozzarella sticks tasted like it was frozen.

I went there for Sunday Brunch. It was my 8 years old cousins b'day and she loves this place for some reason.The place was packed. We waited for good 25 min to find a table.  It took another 10 min for the server to get us just the menus and another 15 min to get the orders.  For appitizers we ordered artichoke dip,mozzarella sticks , calamari (but they were out) , chicken pot sticks . The dip tasted real bad , it smelt like processed cheese with no signs of artichoke. The mozzarella sticks were alright , the chicken pot stickers were way salty and came with soya sauce (which already has a lot of salt).  I also ordered their salad with salmon. The salmon was flaky and the taste wasn't fresh at all. The artichokes in my salad tasted old as well. The ingreidents were not fresh , from the lettuce to the artichoke to even fries and dips. Everything tasted so processed and out of a can or box.  The serivce was extremely slow , we had to tell the waiter 3 times for the refills.  Kids for some reason like this place because they have an ok. kids menu (minni burgers, pizza, spaghetti, grilled cheese sandwich, chicken tenders) They also get treated special , like they get their crayons etc to color away. Watch out though , the kids portions are as huge as adults especially spaghetti , so have two kids share them.  The only thing good here was their PIZOOKIE !  Huge , gigantic cookie , with two scoops of  vanilla bean ice cream on top. The cookie was real soft and chewy with melted chocolate chips , not bad at all !

Patrick D.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,3,,2.0,7/9/2013,"When my friend and I walked into the store, we were not greeted nor asked the size of our party.

She then pointed to a booth in the back and told us that it was open as soon as they cleaned it up. Other guests had a hostess bring them to their table with menus, but my friend and I were sent to the back by ourselves like second class citizens. Strike one. When our waiter came by, he was not particularly engaging, and seemed a bit frustrated. That could be because of the lunch rush, but it still lacked a bit of professionalism. Strike two. Our food came, and I thoroughly enjoyed my grilled patty melt. However, my friend ordered a deep dish pizza, and I have to say it was entirely underwhelming.

But BJ's in Sugar Land also has problems. We ordered a Cobb salad, which was good, and fish tacos. We weren't particularly hungry so we were just splitting. Like I said, the salad was fairly good, but our tacos came and were just plain gross. My husband thought they had Indian seasonings in them but my main complaint was the fish was in the form of a fish stick!! $10 for two fish sticks!! Whhaaat?  We asked to change our order to something simple (we thought) and got a cheeseburger. Well done. Coming 15 minutes later, we cut it to split and it was pink inside. Sigh.  My husband is far more gracious than I am. He wanted to pay for the terrible meal and apologize to me for taking me there again when we knew bad things happen every time we try. I didn't want to pay for any of the disaster. I didn't think we should need to when it was almost inedible and took hours of our time. Ended up not paying for the entrées.

I love artichokes but wasn't crazy about the thick crispy breading, so I won't order this appetizer again. For the main entree, our server recommended Tuscan Chicken Limone and Moroccan Spiced Salmon. Jason's salmon was full of wonderful spices. My chicken Limone was very creamy and rich but not overwhelming. The artichoke mixed well with angel hair pasta in the lemony sauce, once you add sun dried tomatoes on top, it just doesn't get any better than that! Or does it? Yes, the chicken is actually the best part. Tender, juicy, thinly pounded and breaded, soaked in lemon goodness, each little bit is a little taste of heaven. During our meal, our funny and resourceful waiter Jacob brought a sample of his favorite beer Jeremiah Red for Jason. His report on this Irish style ale is tasty, rich and smooth.

Tammy B.,"Houston, TX",8,42,,3.0,8/10/2011,"Food was good.  I am thankful for their gluten-free items, although they are a little hard to find in the ""war and peace"" sized menu.  I ordered the pork chops and substituted broccoli for the mashed potatoes (b/c i'm sensitive to dairy also).. I appreciated the flexibility to make substitutions.  I also enjoyed the Redbridge gluten free beer, which tasted light and refreshing.  I haven't had a beer for 8 months since being diagnosed with gluten intolerance, so it was a treat.  Unfortunately, the server was quite slow, and minimally attentive.  Also, one of our menus contained ""extra"" contents of somebody's slimy jelly.  Gross.  Hence the 3 star rating, but I would probably go back again..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=300
Kate W.,"Ithaca, NY",28,300,38,4.0,8/28/2010,"I guess I've never really read the full name of this place because I was surprised when we went there for dinner last weekend.  There was a 25 minute wait to get a table, so we headed in to the bar to get a beer and then take it out to the waiting area outside.  I was pleasantly surprised by all the taps (this is when I realized that they call themselves a brewhouse and therefore probably have a larger beer selection).  They are, indeed, a ""brewhouse"" (though I got the impression that they claim smaller breweries's beers as ""house brews""... who knows.). I found the way they did their samplers a little obnoxious, but the beer itself was varied and good.  That berry brew was an insult to beers the world over, but I didn't really expect it to be anything but horrifyingly gross when I ordered it.  They only allow 4 samples at a time, don't give them to you in flights (this is a pain if you're trying to carry them and drinks for others out to where you're waiting outside), only do samples of some of the beers on draught, and refer to all of their brews by the type and not the full name.  When there's more than one lager on tap and I'm trying to taste every beer in the place, having the bartender/server tell me that ""This is the lager"" as though there's only one lager on earth is a little annoying.  And when I ordered them by name, they didn't always know which beer it was unless I said ""the stout"" or what have you. Anyways, the food is pretty good.  We ordered everything to share (except for my niece's mac and cheese, though I decided she could share anyways) and it was quite good.  The caprese salad in particular is a good sharing dish--they do the little grape tomatoes and mozzarella balls with perfect dressing, so it's easier to share than you would think a salad would be.  Even the lettuce garnish was tasty (I'd had about 6 tasters by then, sue me)! Their approach to seating when it's busy is pretty idiotic, though.  I can't imagine that we would have had to wait half an hour if they'd seated couples at tables for 2 instead of the 6-top booths.  Then they tried to put our party of 5 at a square table clearly designed for no more than 4 that was right in the most heavily trafficked area of the restaurant.  Really?  Not a good idea for us or for their servers, who would have had to dodge and weave around us like it was an obstacle course.  We asked for a different table, so they moved us to another 4-top that was 1 table in from the heavily trafficked area.... better, but not great.  I'm very surprised that there were so many couples at those huge booths--they need hosts who know how to say no on a busy night.  It was just silly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=300

As far as my mom's experience goes, she has met a few friends at BJs and they can't seem to get things together.  Anything from handing her the wrong food, the waiters leaving for long periods of time without giving out silverware, pouring the wrong drinks, forgetting to bring the check, giving her food to the wrong table and so on.  I just don't get why this place is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=300
Kate A.,"Sugar Land, TX",124,430,16,5.0,6/2/2013,"I came here on a Saturday with my fiance to check out the restaurant as a possible place to hold a corporate recognition dinner. The place is big and OPEN. The bar is to the right, the seating area is in the middle, and there's a section to the left that can be reserved for private parties. The one minor note I'd like to add is that some of the chandeliers' cords block the televisions, so be sure to sit in the bar area if you want to watch a sports game. We sat in the middle section and our server was busy but visited our table frequently. We ordered the fried artichokes as an appetizer and yowza! They're delicious! It comes with an aoli dipping sauce that I recommend you use sparingly, but it's still yum. For our meal, I ordered the roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread. I had to use a fork to help eat up the veggies that fell onto the plate. It was great! The bread wasn't too soggy nor was it too crispy. The vegetables were not dried out and the pairing with the goat cheese- awesome. My fiance ordered the small deep dish pepperoni pizza. Hmm... not sure what to say here because I felt torn. My family is from Chicago so when I hear ""deep dish pizza"" I think of lots of meats, sauce, and cheeses. Sorry to say but BJ's Restaurant's deep dish pizza is mostly just extra bread.

The menu seems to offer the same kind of appetizers, soups, salads, etc. as Chili's or other super successful chain restaurants.  Basically it's all fail safe stuff - nothing adventurous or daring for the more sophisticated palate, but I suppose you would expect that from a chain restaurant!  Granted it's a huuuge menu, so I guess if you don't have strict dietary restrictions, like me - you'll find something that will tickle your fancy.  There are vegetarian entrees, but none that would seem really easily veganized.  This particular location is quite spacious, so it'd be a prime location for a family gathering or a graduation dinner!

Chelsea S.,"Sugar Land, TX",46,78,154,5.0,4/12/2012,"I've pretty much loved this place ever since it opened in the area. Seeing it pop up in other areas around Houston is awesome too. BJ's opened when I wasn't of drinking age yet so I never got to experience their special beers till a few years later, but I pretty much fell in love with their crispy chicken sandwich and their pizookies. So much so that it became a favorite place of mine to eat around Sugar Land. When I would come home from college on the weekends, I'd always suggest to eat here with the family.  When I saw that one had opened in San Antonio just by randomly driving by, to say I was excited is an understatement. Friends at the time had never heard of the place or ever eaten there, so my enthusiasm for the restaurant was unfounded to them. But they found my loud vocal declaration, ""I love BJ's,"" in the middle of parking lot of a small Mexican restaurant amusing, while I realized a few seconds too late what else that implied. Yes, there were on-lookers, but you know what? I'm not ashamed!  Anyways, like I said I love the food here. Finally when I was of age I got to try one of their hand-crafted beers. The name of it escapes me, since I normally don't go there to drink but it was fruity, kind of like a berry taste and I do remember that it was good. Back to the food, my favorite thing to order here and which is always default is the crispy chicken sandwich. The combination of their fried chicken strips or tenderloins, honey mustard and the cheese garlic bread roll is pretty much what perfection tastes like. So good! Their potato wedges are also some of my favorite potato wedges I've ever had in life and that's not a sarcastic exaggeration at all, I genuinely really love those fries! I also love their deep dish pizza. One of my good friends and I come here often whenever we meet up since ironically there is also a BJ's in The Woodlands where she lives and our go-to order is always a medium pepperoni and sausage deep dish pizza. It's so good and never mind the fact that we are ALWAYS starving before we go here, but it's even better that the pizza is one of the most delicious things ever. Other items I've had here are exceptional also, I don't recall ever ordering something that I didn't like or was disappointed over except maybe their special or hand-crafted sodas. Their ""cream"" soda doesn't even really taste like a dreamsicle, but more like orange fanta with a slight ""cream"" after taste. Pretty nasty in my opinion, I'll just stick to the strawberry lemonade. Certainly doesn't negate all the positives about BJ's for me however. Definitely still a favorite of mine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=320

Maria L.,"Atlanta, GA",28,200,,3.0,4/14/2010,"I've been here a few times and loved their deep dish pizza (can't remember which toppings I actually got...), so on my most recent visit I ordered a medium pizza ($20.00) to split with my mom. We got 1/2 barbecue chicken pizza and 1/2 spinach with artichokes. My dad ordered (or rather I ordered for him...) parmesan crusted chicken (with sides of broccoli and rice). The food took a while to come out - 20 min more or less (?) which was expected for the pizza to bake. The pizza this time was fairly good, not as good as I remembered it. I love how on the crust there's an edge of crispiness to it, but maybe because I've been eating so many thin crust pizzas lately, their thick crust tasted a little too heavy/oily for my taste. BBQ chicken needed more BBQ flavor. Spinach with artichokes was a bit heavy on the cheese.  I tried a couple bites of my dad's entree and it was very good, although it could have benefited from less of the sauce (lemon chardonnary butter sauce) on top. He was happy with his meal and called it ""delicious!"" Anyway, I wish my schedule were such that I could go back to BJs for lunch because I really want to get their chicken tenders + fries lunch special again... it was a while ago but I still remember the succulent, tender meat, lightly breaded just the way I like it.

The food took forever despite us being just about the only people there, and she kept avoiding us when it was time for the check. Once my fiance and I went for dinner and the waiter forgot our appetizers and another instance, my mother asked for more dressing for her salad and they brought her the wrong dressing and argued with her when she said it was wrong.  For the price that you pay, you would think the service would be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=340
Heather S.,"Rosenberg, TX",18,2,1,1.0,4/2/2014,"I usually think BJs is a pretty cool place, however, this experience probably changed my mind forever.  First of all it wasn't very crowded, but the hostess thought everyone in the restaurant should sit together.  Our waiter came off a little impatient as I was on a date tonight. When I finally decided on what to get I was ordering a black and bleu burger and requested the Parmesan crusted bun they listed on their house burger.  Well he says I'll see if I can do that. They brought out out appetizer which was pretty good, it was interrupted about 2 minutes after with our entrees. A waitress asked if she could take the appetizer we just got out of our way... I had to remind her that she literally just set it on the table. She replied with an ""oh yeah"".  Well she set my ""burger"" down and it was cut up, charred and on a French roll.  I told our waiter it wasn't a Parmesan crusted roll, it was clearly a French roll. So he said something like wait let me see the menu, proceeded to look at it and said ""we don't have that"". So I say okay... He asked if I wanted a regular bun. About ten minutes later he comes back and sets this burger in front of me. This burger was un carefully pieced back together from the French roll mess they had previously brought me. I told him it was unacceptable and I didn't want it... Then, and only then did he offer to get it recooked.  I have never worked in a restaurant but I don't think I could ever serve that to someone..

Jason K.,"Houston, TX",17,16,,3.0,1/5/2009,"The BJ's chain caught my interest as I thought it was an actual brewpub, but it turns out while most of their restaurants have their own beer it wasn't brewed on premises.  According to their website, it would have to be a BJ's Restaurant and Brewery to have the beer brewed on site.  As far as I can tell, the beers at these locations in Houston are contract brewed at Saint Arnold brewery, but that hasn't been confirmed. There is good parking and great seating available at this location and I've never had to wait  too long for a table, but that might have been a happy coincidence. The food here is pretty good and I love the wide variety of options they have available.  None are the best meal I've ever had, but they are all good for a tasty evening.  I do highly recommend the pazookie (sp) which is a huge warmed cookie on a plate with ice cream on top.  It's excellent.  I have yet to try the pizza, which is supposed to be one of their signature items as there are too many other things that catch my eye (open faced sandwiches, oh yes), but they do look pretty good from seeing one at another table. The beer is what I came for and it didn't disappoint, even though it wasn't brewed on site.  I really like their nitro porter and imperial stout, both are wonderful with the previously mentioned pazookie.  Their Red Ale is a happy hoppy brew to have with almost any meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=340

This is a very casual, fun place. Weekends get a little crazy and it is nice to marvel at a successful business while waiting for the waiter to bring your drinks. Definitely remember to ""call ahead"" on weekends. It is their version of taking reservations, I believe... Pricey for the food it serves: sandwiches, pizza, burgers, salads. Look to pay $15-20 for a pizza dinner with a drink and a tip. Sadly, I might just have to say it is worth it when it comes to the pizza. Their deep dish pizza is the best pizza I've had. I know all about the popular pizza places-- Star, Candelari's, etc. I am a pizza expert, no joke. While those restaurants are awesome, BJ's deep dish pizza is my personal favorite.

Dan C.,"Washington, DC",62,218,367,2.0,4/29/2010,"I seem to be on a 2 -2.5 star rampage, but recent circumstances seem to be putting me into this land of mediocrity! Let me start off by saying that I like BJ's (no, get your mind out of the gutter!) and have had ample experience eating in other locations. When I lived in Las Vegas, I would frequent the BJ's on W. Charleston Blvd more than several times a year. For me, It was a post climbing ritual where you could relax in the a/c while carb loading on their tasty barley pops and delicious deep dish pizzas. I was always impressed with the food quality and service I received there. In fact, I would easily give that particular chain location a solid 3.5 - 4 stars. Not so, here. On a recent visit to Houston, we agreed to meet some old friends at this particular location for a late Sunday lunch. We ordered the avocado app, a side salad and the mini spinach artichoke pizza. Again, I had much experience with these items before - they were usually the staple of my post-outdoors excursions out west. My friends ordered a couple of sandwiches with steak fries. We also had a few brews to go along with the meal - I've tried all of their brews and they're pretty decent. For some reason today, I just wanted their Piranha Pale Ale. The beer didn't disappoint. What got to me?? First off, the app came and it looked like a disaster had happened on the plate. Presentation shouldn't be a big deal, I know...but it literally looked like they just slapped the cut up pieces of avocado egg rolls on the plate. First impressions sometimes count. While the app didn't taste bad, it wasn't as crispy or well fried as I'd had at the other BJ's. Personally, I think it was under-fried (the prepared eggroll skins just looked pale and white).  I've ordered this dish many times in LV and never had it look so...well, unappetizing. Next the salad. Sure it's just a salad...but it came all chopped up in little cubes (I mean the letuce!) which was weird. To top it off, it looked old - there were bits of red tinges on the little lettuce cubes. Not good. Finally, the pizza. I usually order this knowing that I'll get something decent. Granted, for this meal, it was by far the best dish we tasted. However, I've had better at the other location. It just came out kind of cold and the cheese wasn't near as gooey as I've had in the past. Okay, granted...this is a chain. But as far as food quality control is concerned, this has got to be one of the worst BJ's I've been to. So 2 stars for the food which is weighted heavily for me. Considering it being a sports bar-type chain, I think service and ambiance were fine - easily, 3 - 3.5 stars. Beers deserve a decent 3- 3.5 star rating as well. About the same quality as or slightly less than Gordon-Biersch if you like that stuff. However, for the price of the some of the menu items (avocado eggrolls at $10, the mini pizza at $10, etc...), this was a HUGELY lackluster meal and was the most expensive meal we had that weekend as well as the worst quality (food) meal we experienced. The final bill was ~$80 (no tip) for 2 sandwiches + fries, our pizza, side salad, avocado eggroll app, and 3 beers. I think, for now, I'll pass on this place when I visit home again - there are so many better Houston restos out there for the price. This experience definitely showed me that all chain locations are not created equal. If you do crave this kind of food, I'd rather spend it on chains like Cheesecake factory which seem to offer up better QC on their food (across the nation). Else, if you ever go to LV, *THAT* BJ's on W. Charleston Blvd is pretty darn good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=340

I told him I didn't care, we chose there due to our wonderful experiences with the chain in FL and our experience tonight for a birthday was horrible and unacceptable. He then, finally, apologized. We then asked why the club sandwich was rang up on our ticket three times. He had not planned to take off even a discount at all until I told him this place was horrible in comparison and we were all disappointed.

The chips were stale and tasted worse than any chips I could find at Randalls or Kroger. The BBQ chicken pizza was delicious but $20.00 for a medium seemed like a bit too much. The pizookie was the saving grace for this place. Totally worth it to eat here just for that. Service was ok not great but not bad either.

Marissa B.,"Katy, TX",2,14,,1.0,12/27/2011,"We walked into BJ's Brewhouse in Sugar land around 6 pm and we happily greeted by the young man who showed us to our table after a short wait. That was where the pleasant dining experience ended. As a party of six, we expected that service would be slow, but what we experienced was ridiculous. After ordering our drinks, it took a long time for the server to bring out our two non-alcoholic drinks, and an even longer time for the alcoholic ones. He then took our order for our appetizer of mozzarella sticks, but left without asking whether we were ready to place our food order as well. He returned again, terse as before, barely muttering a word. While initially we assumed he was simply not talkative, we later noticed him animatedly chatting and explaining the menu to the table neighboring us. We grew increasingly impatient as our mozzarella still had not made an appearance and our waiter was no where in sight. One of our party members accidently knocked over a drink during animated conversation, and despite apologizing profusely and us helping clean up with our available napkins, it elicited no response from our waiter. He finally asked her what she was drinking, and said he would bring another. Furthermore, during this hour-long wait, I had nearly finished my root beer with no refill being offered either. Finally, they showed up with our main courses, sans napkins and silverware, but our appetizers had been apparently forgotten. Our waiter made a brief appearance during this time, and at least gave us silverware, but only stayed around long to here us request that our appetizer be taken off our bill since it never arrived before dashing off again before I could request a refill. He then showed up with that previously ordered replacement drink, which we then later saw on the tab that he had charged for it. We then finished our meal, and decided to at least get dessert and also take advantage of the free dessert we had been promised for our birthday girl. We ordered two pizookies, one being free, thinking that would be sufficient. However, our server failed to mention that the free dessert is apparently a personal size. Needless to say we did not leave a generous tip. I thought the deceptively fun atmosphere promoted on their website would be a perfect 21 birthday experience. Clearly I was wrong and will not be visiting there again. Terrible experience and I have never been so ignored at a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=360
Ramona N.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,5,,4.0,7/1/2009,Great Beer (Blonde) and like the Pizza (Mediterranean)...Hubby and I like to go there usually without the kids and watch our favorite game (Baseball/Football) on the many tv screens!  You can sit at the bar tables or in the dining areas...there is a tv screen everywhere you look so you will not miss any action.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=360
Jay L.,"Naperville, IL",2,59,,4.0,1/26/2011,Ate here for lunch on 1-12-11 while on a business trip.  Had their pizza and it was excellent.  It is a sports bar with lots of TV screens for viewing. My colleague had salmon and said it was delicious.  Hope to return again on my next business trip here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sugar-land?start=360
