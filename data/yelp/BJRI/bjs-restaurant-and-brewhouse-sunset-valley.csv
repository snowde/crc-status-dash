Cami J.,"Austin, TX",1,3,1,5.0,5/12/2017,"Now that my local Logan's Roadhouse is closed I was wondering where I would get my Friday night prime rib. Found it tonight at BJ's Brewhouse!

Ekatarina V.,"Austin, TX",186,144,119,2.0,5/28/2016,Haven't been here in years. But the mini Ekat was famished & it was late.  The pizza looked really good. Don't be deceived by looks. I've had better frozen pizza at home.  The bad pizza went well with the disinterested server to make for a really uninspired dinner.

James B.,"Austin, TX",41,73,13,3.0,12/15/2016,"Food is always good, plenty of good options. But service was poor, prices aren't great. Custom beer just isn't competitive with other beers out there.  Should have sat at the bar I guess. Also, they said I had to announce I wanted the happy hour price to get the happy hour price, and that is ridiculous.  Not a good waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=20
dj s.,"San Jose, CA",4,17,9,4.0,12/8/2016,"Gluten-free options make this place a favorite for our family. Even tho the place is usually pretty dark inside, noisy & we'd prefer it otherwise, the food is usually good. I like that they actually know the difference between rare & medium rare.

Julie P.,"Austin, TX",444,80,119,3.0,10/24/2016,"BJ's menu is extensive, but I always felt that the prices didn't meet the quality/quantity of the food. If their prices were a little more on the lower end I would definitely be more drawn to trying out more items on their menu. We've tried their pizza, pasta, salad, appetizers, and every time it's been a disappointment in one way or another. However, their service is always consistent at every visit - reason for 3 stars. Recently, we had our Paint Nite event here in the party seating area, separate from the rest of the restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly and checked in with us whenever he could without being too bothersome in our painting activities.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=20
Amy S.,"Austin, TX",40,104,78,4.0,4/16/2016,"Huge fan.  So many selections.  Sure it's not a mom and pop restaurant or catered to a specific cuisine, but if you don't know what you want or are with a party with a lot of different needs/wants - this is an excellent choice! We ordered the potato skins for an appetizer - deep fried?!  I've wondered if you could make potato skins better.  Turns out you can.  The plating was very nice as well. I ordered the Sriracha honey brussels sprouts.  So. Good. Crispy on the outside and full of flavor.  I also ordered the clam chowder - pretty good and there was a lot of clam!  Usually, that is my one complaint. The rest of the family enjoyed their meal.   4 stars - only down side was the service.  It wasn't extremely busy, but it took quite a bit of time for our server to get our drinks, check back, and finally bring us our check.  My neck is still sore from constantly looking over my shoulder hoping he'd pop over... Final note: right now, via Yelp, you can get $10 off $35.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=20
LaPeshaa C.,"Austin, TX",113,284,458,1.0,3/11/2016,"Came in for drinks. Scotty the bartender comes up, introduces himself, and ask what we'd like. I asked for a couple of minutes. He said ok just don't snap or whistle at me when you're ready.... Weird, why the hell would I?! 10 minutes later, literally 10 minutes, he comes back. We order 2 drinks. 10 mins pass, no drinks. He doesn't come by or look our way so hubbie gets up and ask him about our drinks. He comes by and ask ""what did y'all want again?"" We tell him again. He takes off and another 10 mins go by and you guessed it, STILL NO DRINKS! He ask the folks next to us if they'd like another round. I intrude and say ""can we have our round 1st?"" He replies ""its coming"" and takes off. At this point I'm pissed so I get the mgr, as soon as he sees that he makes our drinks. Shannon, the manager, was no help at all.

And then tonight I had the Mahi mahi and have been suffering for the last several hours with histamine toxicity.  That comes from fish that is not properly refrigerated or not handled correctly, which results in bacterial growth that causes the food poisoning.  I still feel horrible 5 hours later.

Ann N.,"Killeen, TX",34,159,395,5.0,2/13/2016,"Visited this location for lunch and received great service. My husband enjoyed his meal but my avocado eggrolls weren't that appealing to me. The idea for them was excellent but my avocado was a little oxidized resulting in flavor confusion. Other than that, we had a really great visit. We remembered how delicious the pizzas were at the Vegas location and decided to order some for take-out. We loved these pizzas. If you really like that really bready but pan-crisp texture, this is up your alley. They pile that golden crust with abundant toppings and each slice portion is very filling. The chicken bacon ranch pizza was excellent and I would recommend it. Great pizza, good service, and nice location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=20
Debbie T.,"Austin, TX",39,5,,3.0,7/16/2016,"I have never disliked this restaurant, but... I tried to order tacos on corn tortillas, because I cannot have wheat without risking getting sick, and they only had flour/corn mix.  In Austin, where there are high numbers of gluten free people? In Texas, where we have amazing homemade tortillas (flour and corn!)?  I ended up quickly picking a salad from the menu because I was clearly holding things up. I did not like it and did not eat.  By, the time the waiter came back, my companion was done with two bowls of soup, and I did not want to make him wait for a new order, so I ended up not eating dinner. Poorly played, BJs. You have to pay better attention. I do not tend to like chains, so we may call it done. And, we got our check from our waiter before all the food was out. WTH? Who does that?  I eat out a lot... high end, dives, and everything in between. I have literally never seen that. A clear unspoken message...""get out."". Of more importance than the minor disappointment over fish tacos that I really wanted, that was the message we got from the time we ordered drinks until we left. Are we holding you up?   The hosts were great. The waiter needs to smile, be helpful, and generally act like the customers are not an inconvenience. It was not crowded, they did not need to turn tables...and he still ushered us in and out like it was McDonald's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=20

Definitely a violation of her other employees privacy! So I sit down in waiting area, & then they look at me like OMG there's no wait. Next we are seated, &the wait for service begins. 10 minutes goes by & finally a mid 30-50s waiter stops by & says "" after I refill this other tables soda, I will come back to take your drink order.

The menu is very impressive we visited around 6pm on a Saturday evening and were seated immediately. We begun with a Pepperoni Flatbread for our appetizer was very crispy and rich in flavor simply a must! Then onto the entree which I ordered the Chicken Tortilla bowl (not pictured) which was very succulent, the cheesy mashed potatoes were delicious and so were the Dr.Pepper Ribs very sweet and tangy BBQ!

Adrianna E.,"Austin, TX",279,153,154,1.0,5/21/2016,"Man, I really dislike giving bad reviews but this experience was just bad all the way around .... I met up with a few friends on Friday night close to 9pm.  With graduation weekend commencing, I figured it would be busy but it really wasn't too bad.  We grabbed a table in the bar area that hadn't been bussed but as soon as the server came by she grabbed everything, so no big deal.  After grabbing the drink orders, it seemed to all go down hill and stay there for the rest of the night .  We never received sufficient menus for all 5 people , then my salad came out before the apps , still no silverware.  Upon asking the buzzer who brought my salad, he informed me that because it was so busy they had no clean silver ware .... Ummm, how the F am I going to eat my salad bruh? He then returns with a fork, no setting with napkin, just a fork, which wasn't exactly clean.   We finally order a few things to share , stuffed mushrooms , Brussels sprouts and lettuce wraps.  My friends husband order the deep dish ziti as well.  The food came out quickly enough only to find a very long blonde hair baked into the cheese on the ziti.  Needless to say, my appetite along with the person who ordered it , was completely gone.  Eventually, the manager came over And generically apologized to the wrong person in our party either way she offered a free dessert .   I've never been a huge fan of BJ's anyway, other than the pizookie, the food is salty and overpriced , but this experience has cured me from chains for good .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=20
Katie W.,"Austin, TX",4,27,10,1.0,5/23/2016,"Damn it!!! I used to love BJs so much! When I lived up north, the one on Mopac was my go-to for datenight, and for afterparty deliciousness. The avocado egg rolls were so addicting, it wasn't fair. Flash-forward to last night, I might as well have lit $40 on fire and flushed it down the toilet. I ordered avocado eggrolls, calamari, and a pulled pork sandwich for pick up. The calamari was chewy, bland, and soggy. The avocado in the avocado eggrolls was black and the wrapper was soggy.  Don't even get me started on the pulled pork sandwich. The meat tasted like it was cooked a week ago. In good faith, I tried smothering it in bbq sauce, but the rancidity was overpowering. It was just too far gone. Everything I ordered went in the trash.  In all honesty, I can overlook the sogginess of the calamari and eggrolls, because when you put hot food in an air-tight plastic container, it's going to steam. But the blackness of the avocado and the taste of that pulled pork will haunt me in my sleep forever.  I hate it when something that used to bring you so much joy goes so far south. I used to love BJs! DAMMIT!!!! (I can't say that without giggling just a little bit, but I'm still angry!) PS: I must say though that the young gentleman at the takeout counter was extremely pleasant and professional.

Chris M.,"Austin, TX",1,64,4,1.0,9/23/2017,Tried bjs carry out again after a while of swearing it off.  Ordered two of the southern fried chicken lunch specials.  When I got it home I wondered what happened to the chicken part of it.  I removed the tiny chicken piece from each container to weigh them.  One was 2.3 oz and the other was 2.8 oz.  Now I wasn't expecting a pound of chicken but 2 oz is embarrassing and quite frankly a rip off.  I have pictures of the digital scale with each piece of chicken on it to show I am not making up numbers.  Come on bjs chicken is a cheap ingredient and you gave me 25 cents worth. On the plus side the mobile checkout and curbside delivery was excellent and my order was correct.  I should say that bjs did seem to address that issue and I was satisfied with the service as opposed to in the past.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley
Stephanie A.,"Austin, TX",45,164,1302,4.0,8/23/2017,"Came here for a quick bite to eat with my daughter as we had one of their lovely coupons.  The place was a bit empty but that was because we came during non peak hours.  We were seated in a booth and a nice man came to ask us about drinks which he was quick to return with.  We then ordered some food, we enjoyed the following: Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos:  These are usually my ""Go To"" when I visit BJs and I absolutely love them. The pita bread is fresh and the yogurt cream they use is tangy and delicious. The tomatoes and cucumbers lightly seasoned compliments well with this taco. The only complaint I have ever had is the cubed chicken mean, I would prefer perhaps shredded chicken or some other way way to cut it up.  We both opted for different sides, although the bistro grains are scrumptious as well.  We both chose to enjoy some of their delicious broccoli cheese soup.  Unfortunately this came out pretty cold as if the bowls were sitting on a counter too long but when we brought this up to our waiter - he took them back and had them warmed up.  To be honest, I would have preferred a fresher bowl, but we didn't want to wait any longer. My daughter also enjoyed the Mac & Cheese which was extremely yummy, very creamy with good seasonings and a bit different then we are use to but definitely something we would both order again. All in all our visit was rather good as well as the food and customer service. Thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley

The burgers were unbelievably good. We also had their craft beer (hefeweizen), which was awesome. The only low point was the service, which started out great, but then was non existent.

Cj A.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2018,I'm a big BJs fan. But this place has really gone downhill lately. The service is terrible. The wait staff is rude. Management is uncaring and unresponsive.

Ashley V.,"Austin, TX",296,155,376,2.0,3/19/2017,"At first it reminded me of a Cheesecake Factory but with a brewery or bar vibe. We ordered the pork green verde queso to start. It came out, no pork just green sauce on queso. I told the waiter it didn't have pork he told me that I must've ordered the wrong one. He then brings out the queso with beef chili in it and says ""now there, that looks like it has pork in it"" I said ""I disagree, that's the other option that has beef chili in it. The verde one you brought didn't have any pork in it."" He said he would let the manager know and left the chili queso on the table.  My Cobb salad was decent at best. Tomatoes were mealy and chicken was obviously previously frozen. My boyfriends brisket burger was good.  Our queso should've been comped or he could've at least comped my boyfriends tea but nope.

Menu selection is broad and my maple salmon pita tacos hit the spot. The place kind of reminds me of  Bennigan's Restaurant from the 80's in the heyday, but with stronger & tasty food selections & wider beer selections. One minor concern was the table we were seated at lacked proper wipe down for clean appearance that you expect.

All the dishes that was ordered at our table seemed really delicious. I got a salad (forgot its name) and it got me full believe or not!

To my surprise, the dough was extremely soft and the toppings went very well together. The only thing I have to say is the meatballs tasted a little undercooked.  My friends and I ordered the classic Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla Ice Cream Pizookie and devoured that in less than 5 minutes. The combination of the two melted in my mouth and it was heaven.

The servers themselves weren't bad, they were just very overloaded. Two servers for an entire bar full of people?! Two times I went during happy hour for the specials and sat in the bar at a table. Both times I didn't receive happy hour prices. Tonight I requested my bill be adjusted and when he brought it back, only two of three items were corrected. Rather than wait another 10 minutes for the server to come back, I just paid and left - feeling ripped off since I'd gone there just for their specials. Why bother have a happy hour if the patron will leave less happy than when they came in?! Pros: Food is decent for a chain. Servers were always pleasant, just way too many tables. Clean environment. Good beer selection. Cons: 20 minutes from the time we sat down to even see a server is ridiculous. The food arrived before my drink order! Plates were never cleared from the table on any of my three visit. Messed up bills on two of my three visits. It shouldn't take 90 minutes for a beer and an appetizer on a Wednesday night. They lost a customer. Too many other places to eat in Austin to patronize a restaurant with bad service that doesn't honor specials.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=60

We waited for over 15 minutes and nobody came to even take our drink order. I walked over to the hostess stand to let her know and she could care less. She told us that we could sit in a different section. So, we moved to another section.  We sat down and noticed that a couple who were seated after us were greeted by the server and he took their drink order and didn't stop by our table.  At that point it was 1:22pm and still no service. We got up and told the hostess again that nobody came to the table and we wanted the manager and she said they were busy.

This place definitely feels like the Chain restaurant it is, but I will say, I love their buffalo chicken pizza which I've had maybe a half dozen times or so.  It's deep dish, which typically is not my favorite style, but they do a great job with it here.  The dough is really fluffy and soft on the inside and it has a nice lightly crusty exterior to it and tastes very fresh.  The toppings with celery, chicken and buffalo sauce drizzled on top really make it.   The only time I've ventured outside of the buffalo chicken pizza, I think was to get the avocado rolls appetizer which were pretty terrible.  It was basically a wonton wrapper stuffed with unseasoned avocado and then fried.  Overly creamy, and not seasoned or balanced in any way.  Just mushy and warm.    Their beers here are about average in terms of craft beers, but they are all very drinkable, with nothing so crazy that you have to just sip and don't really enjoy slinging back.  I'd definitely get the sampler flight to try them all and see what you like. Service is typically average.  I definitely enjoy the usual here, but can't really speak for anything else on the menu and at a place like this, I'm not really too interested in trying everything out anyway, as it's all pretty ordinary stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=60

Bruce B.,"Austin, TX",4,39,7,2.0,9/8/2016,"Gets 2 stars only because the bar area is so cool and nice. I love the 4 tv's and the bar top is classy looking. That's about all I can say here that's good. Came here a couple months back for lunch and the server charged me the dinner price for the lunch special. When I mentioned it she said she could fix it, I told her not to worry about it because I KNOW that the first preauthorization for the first charge wont go away from my account until 4 or 5 days later which makes that money unavailable to me until then. She insisted that wouldn't happen, so like a dumb dumb I listen to her and she came back with the correct amount but sure enough I now have 2 charges for similar amounts on my card. It is extremely aggravating when I know I'm right and a server insists I am not, and I end up being right. I pull up my account on my phone to politely show her how credit card preauths work, and explained that just because you void a preauth it doesn't make it go away from my account immediately. This is why I wanted to just pay the overpriced incorrect amount because although it sucks to be overcharged, it sucks even more to be charged twice for a period of 5 business days. Then the server explains to me that she has had a rough week because a family member died and that she isn't all there this week. Awkward to tell a stranger. Came here today cuz coworker insisted cuz bday. I ordered fried chicken w gravy and mash. The gravy is not gravy, it's an oily type of sauce with a strong, unpleasant, and indescribable taste which covered everything and left that aftertaste after every bite of chicken and mash. Mash was a GIANT lump of dried mess. I asked server Kyle for some brown gravy to moisten that shit to make it edible (cuz hey I paid for it) but they didn't have brown gravy. I did not want anymore of the oily stuff they call their white gravy. So I just stopped eating all together. Kyle was very well-mannered server but when we tell you we just need an extra minute to decide on the menu don't leave us there for 10 minutes on our lunch break dude. Cmon. Place was empty (late lunch) and he was nowhere to be found most of the meal he spent a lot of time in the kitchen for some reason. Kyle charged my friend $4 for the soup when the menu said $1.50 as an add on for lunch. We showed Kyle and he said ""Sorry I never work lunches."" Kyle I don't think you work at all. Service ain't in your wheelhouse broseph. As I said before, very well-mannered but not a good server. Came here about a year ago as well to watch a ball game and the deep dish pizza was all bread in there, no toppings other than that first layer. Cool bar to have a beer and catch a game but not to eat. Menu looks so freakin good but when you get the plate it just sucks and only decent service I've had is when I sit in the bar section. Too many good places within throwing distance to eat for this kitchen to suck in its execution as much as it does. Doc's has great burgers and beer specials, Tarka Kitchen for some good Indian, and Carino's for some good pasta. Sucks to pay $15 at BJ's and still leave starving. None of that food is sitting well with my stomach either as I type this.

andy c.,"Austin, TX",6,5,,1.0,5/21/2017,"Me and my family have been going to this location since it opened. Granted it's probably been about 6 months since we've eaten there,but we decided to get some take out tonight. Turns out this was the worst idea ever. The food was a pure disappointment. For starters,unripe avacados were used on my sandwich,this was a chicken club with really oily and greasy bread. The point of a club is to be a healthy option. Saturated fat isn't healthy at all. Then to add the fact they took away the option of wedge or thin fries,to only be replaced by a single fry option(which they were overdone and flavorless) I wanted wedge fries. I'm positive I'm not the only one unhappy with this change. My next complaint is the ""avocado egg rolls"". Egg rolls are supposed to be crispy. At least firm if nothing else. What we got was a soggy,greasy,brown avocado mess. I couldn't even finish the one I started. Then whoever the genius at corporate who decided avocado is going to pair up nice with a sweet soy dipping sauce was dead wrong. We hoped the sauce would help the failed frying attempt. Wrong. It only made it worse. Needless to say,that whole appetizer went straight to the trash. Then my wife's prime rib dip(which is fair sized sandwich) came with a 2 oz to go ramekin of au'jus. What we have normally received with this order in the past was at least 5oz Togo container of dip. The only thing we ordered that came anywhere close to acceptable,was the kids spaghetti(which was still a bit greasy for pasta sauce). But this should be expected to the fact it's pretty hard to mess up spaghetti. Also the kids apple juice was prepared way before our arrival,so all the ice had melted and it was a diluted mess. Luckily the girl at the Togo counter dumped it out and made a new one for us. So in all,I think it's safe for you to assume the conclusion that we won't ever eat there again. Since their obvious recent menu change and apparently a poor decision of a chef/executive chef who can't assure the highest quality food leaves their kitchen,then you can bet we won't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=40

We never have a craving to come here but when there's a BOGO coupon online it makes this place a very good deal for Italian food. I tried their deep dish lasagna which was basically a deep pan filled with cheese raviolis, sausage, pepperoni, red sauce and cheese. Yes it was delicious but after 5 or 6 bites I was already full. Their wedge salad is also amazing and a great add-on to an entree for only about $3. The service here is great as their whole team of waiters aside from your own are all happy to help you. Oh not a bad place to watch some games either, they have huge screens pretty much all over the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=40
Katrina H.,"Dallas, TX",0,13,10,3.0,2/27/2016,We came on a Friday around 8pm and waited about 35 mins. I noticed a lot more children at this location than any other BJ's that I've visited. We were sat but not talked to by the waiter for about 10 mins. Another waiter stopped by to see if our drink order had been taken and then continued to service our table. We received fabulous service from there on out! The BJ Royal Soda was pretty good.

Christi K.,"Austin, TX",50,114,644,5.0,5/11/2015,"I really liked this place. I'm not sure why people seem to dislike it so much. We didn't have a bad experience here. My husband and I went on a Saturday night around 6:30/7 and there was no wait. We were seated right away and our server was there immediately. We started with the Santa Fe Spring Rolls which were very good. I liked both dipping sauces it came with, but favored the Santa Fe dressing over the avocado cream sauce. The outside crust was crispy and flaky. They were greasy, but it's a fried roll, it's supposed to be! I ordered the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. I enjoyed these. I ate one whole taco and the other I just ate the inside. I wasn't a fan of the grains that came as a side. It wasn't that they were bad, I just don't like stuff like that. My husband got the Hickory brisket and bacon burger. Talk about a meat lovers dream and heart attack. It was a patty, bacon and brisket with cheese on it. He absolutely enjoyed it!! He said it was one of the better burgers he has had in a long time. He ordered the wedge fries with it. I ate those off this plate ;) We both liked them, it's a wedge fry, what's not to like. I always like the seasoning on wedge fries. This place has such a large menu, it's overwhelming what to order.

Amanda B.,"Austin, TX",2,4,,1.0,5/26/2016,"This review is mostly for experience. I've been to just about all of the bjs in Austin.. But this one can't seem to get even close to good costumer service. NEVER ORDER TO GO!!! Unless you want to pay for things you don't even get. They have left things out of my order every time I have gotten food. But to last night. I came in to order because last time I did curb side and called it took them 20 min to bring me my ice cold food. I went in and waited for ever because some blond guy at check out couldn't get the lady in front of me checked out. Hers ended up being 50 flat and she didn't tip. So I went to check out and started looking through MY OWN ORDER instead of the employee verifying I have what I paid for. I kindly informed him he forgot my items and it's been consistent here. He did apologize and got me a soda while my boyfriend and I waited for them to fix our order. Again that I paid for. To come to check me out and put my food in the bag to tell me to ""have a nice day, not that's completely sarcastic I hope your day sucks"" in such a fake sarcastic voice, yea that's what an employee said. You want to know why?!! Cause the woman in front didn't tip. I left him like 10% tip on my receipt but instead of looking at the things he didn't finish he just automatically assumed that one was mine. I even tried to explain to him that receipt wasn't mine it was hers. He didn't even care to listen. I let it go because he didn't look fully there..I should have gotten a manager. So embarrassing there were people all around. By farrrr the worst experience I've ever had in any restaurant industry. Will be talking negatively about this restaurant any time asked. Will not be coming back . And I'm writing a letter to the corporate office. You guys need to get your to go ordering fixed. And loose the assholes that you hire. Just cause that's the only job that they can get. They need more experience in costumer service. This guy wasn't new or anything cause he did chime to me well I hope that wasn't me who had messed it up before he started being rude.  If there was an option to rate no stars or even negative that's what I would truly be rating. Don't come here unless like I said you want to pay for things you don't even get, have cold food when you get it, be mistreated by staff, then be treated like you owe them something more just because they fixed your messed up order!!!! So ridiculous and could definitely express way more on how frustrated I am at this specific business. No wonder all the bjs are popping but this one hardly packs full.

Also there are TV screens around the walls and bar area, but they are not overwhelming for others who do not wish to watch them. The beer selection is massive and they brew a lot of their own. I think I had the porter ale that was pretty damn good last time. Calamari appetizer is very good and tender (breading not too heavy). Their burgers are really good and I order them here a lot. They are flamebroiled and always come out tasty. I have also had the shrimp tacos that are good but not enough food if you ask me. On the down side: Menu is too big. Its hard to navigate the whole thing and seems like its all over the place. Also sometimes when busy our waiter has taken a bit longer than normal (as to be expected), but has happened to us a few times so had to mention. Lastly some items are way overpriced.

Ella D.,"Plano, TX",1323,419,1599,3.0,8/12/2013,"Eh. More like 2 1/2.  First, the rant: Service at the bar was egregiously slow. And the bartender we had has a habit of printing out your tab after EVERYTHING you order and putting it in a rocks glass right in front of you. We seriously thought we were being cut off and closed out after ordering a first round. We had to ask him what was going on and he said he does it to avoid discrepancies or confusion about tabs. Which we read as: I've had arguments in the past with customers about tabs and this is how I make sure you know what's on your tab at all times. Hint: this is uncomfortable and a bit rude - and unnecessary. He reprints the tab every time you make an order and puts it right back in front of you.  If you do it for yourself, then keep the tabs in your book or your apron so that if a customer has a question about what you've charged, then you can refer to it. But this is an extra step you're taking time to do that potentially makes customers uncomfortable (it's pushy and it makes the tab / money a focal point of the experience) when you're already weeded. Stop it.  That being said, the bar stools were probably 3/4 taken and the dining room was starting to bustle, but there was only one bartender who wasn't a pro at multi tasking to begin with. Now, the goods: I've never had their pizzas but the ones I saw coming out looked appetizing enough. We ordered just beverages and two appetizers - Chips and Salsa and the Avocado Egg Rolls. Of the two, I found the chips & salsa more remarkable. But to be fair, my friend loves the egg rolls and always orders them. I recommend ordering them with ranch dressing instead of the dipping sauce it comes with (which is very sweet) Now, that being said, I actually have to say their salsa is pretty darn good. A mini bottle (two pours) of Chandon is only about $8.75 and they have a decent wine and very nice beer selection.  They have a kid's menu which, for a sports bar that's leaning upscale, was unexpected to me. I've had lunch here in the past with my daughter who loves their pinwheel potatoes (their version of fries... and that's not what they're called, it's just how I remember them.) Also, if you order the chicken tenders, they're made fresh, not frozen and nuked... I know this because I once had to send them back as the centers were pink. The entire meal was replaced instantly and we were perfectly taken care of, so I had no problems with them and appreciate that they make these from scratch.  The big shout out I have for BJ's? Best damn Ranch Dressing I've had. I'm serious. I don't know why. In the past, we've asked for extra to take it home in ramekins.

I'll touch on my last experience which was very recent.  I ordered the balsamic chicken for take out, and what I got was a disaster. I got overcooked frozen chicken thrown on a plate with cold and uneatable mashed potatoes. (I don't know how you can mess up mashed potatoes) on the side was three or four pieces of soggy lettuce and some soggy cold onions. Zero ""crispy onion strings"" like it says on the menu. The worst part about it all was the heaping amount of sauce in, on, and around the food.  This was downright the worst $16 I have ever spent, and not my first bad experience with the food here. I'm not one to normally one to heavily criticize restaurants, but beware the food here has been very low quality in my personal experiences. I hope it has been better for others. But I will definitely not be coming back. REVIEW UPDATE: I was politefully contacted by the owner who reached out an apologized. Such a nice gesture that I decided to go back and see if I could have a different experience with this place. I did. I ordered the same dish and got an incredible clean hot and (fully loaded with crispy onion strings) version of the balsamic chicken.

BJs looks like it is trying to be a Cheesecake Factory, but maybe they should spend less money on the decor and more on the food. I got the fish and chips and clam chowder. The fish was clearly frozen fish. To make it worse, it was overcooked, dark brown (despite being called ""blonde"" fish and chips), and greasy. They gave very few fries, and the ones they gave me were limp, soggy, and also greasy. I ordered the clam chowder, which also was clearly not made fresh. The bowl was about the size of a cup. It was thick like paste and had very little clam. My boyfriend had a burger, which was nothing special. Everything was just bad. I guess we should have anticipated it wasn't going to be good when it was ready in just 15 minutes. Save $30 and buy yourself a box of Mrs Paul's and On-Cor Salisbury steaks at the grocery store. It won't taste any worse than BJs.

The beers are all good in my opinion. I especially like the porter and red ales.  My only issue is that they do not brew on site, so it's not really a brewery. From what I understand, they brew all their beer at a central location that's not even in Texas.

I asked 2 questions, (politely) 1. Why did my salad come out with my soup? And 2. Why did my entree come out before my boyfriends? The server apologized and said it was a mistake. I waited until my boyfriend got his food and then ate (amazing food of course)  The last time I got this soup/salad combo, last Sunday night (oct. 4th) the same thing happened. Maybe it's just their thing to send out one persons entree before the other, and with an appetizer ( the salad) however, since the first time my server told me it was a mistake, I kindly told the food runner "" oh I didn't know they would come out at the same time, I thought the salad would come out first!"" And the food runner was very snotty and said "" THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COME OUT TOGETHER!!!!!!!!!"" And sped off. Such a jerk. Again, I waited to eat my food until my boyfriend got his. The server heard me talking about the situation and understood why I was confused and said he didn't know why the establishment did things that way. I honestly have never seen another place that doesn't 1. Serve the salad first and 2. Serve all the entrees together......although the server was nice, it took 10 minutes to get greeted, another 5 for drinks, and a very long time to get the bill. Service is always very crappy, every single time we have gone. In short, while the food is here always amazing, the service needs major improvement. Hostesses don't smile, look bored and like they hate their jobs. Servers are very inattentive and I often see them standing around chatting and flirting with each other. Food runners are rude and snippy, when no one freaking told me that their soup and salad comes out TOGETHER and before every other entree!

Shani S.,"Austin, TX",438,514,442,1.0,4/16/2014,"So, we made reservations for a Friday evening.  We show up and let them know we are there (at 6:50) for our 7pm reservation. Let me preface this by saying that my aunt is handicapped and that standing for her is very hard.  Also, BJ's is packed with children running about.  Ok, back to my experience.  After letting the hostess know that we were there for our 7pm reservations, she tells us it will be about 30 minutes before they can seat us.   Uhhhhh  What? I ask her ""What is the point of a reservation if we still need to wait the 30 minutes to be seated?"" She doesn't even respond, merely rolls her eyes and walks away.  Awesome.  My aunt and uncle arrive.  There is no place for her to sit, as all the seating is taken up with other families waiting to be seated.  Maybe they had 6:30 reservations?.... I help my aunt over to what I am hoping might be a safe zone and stand with her and chat.  Well, I sucked at the whole protective barrier thing, as a small child comes running by and almost knocks her down.   I love kids, don't get me wrong... I don't like parents that can't teach their children to maintain a behavior suitable to situations.  This is isn't a park. Shaken, I help my aunt to a bar stool that my uncle has grabbed and we seat her quickly.  A man, whom I will assume was the manager, then stomps over and says ""You can't let her sit there!  This will not do.  Move that stool now!"" I explain what's happened to my aunt, that we're trying to help her, our reservation issue and he scowls at me and says ""Look, I said this won't do.  Move her.  Now."" ""Where would you have me put her?  Let me know if we can sit somewhere else and I'll get her there, sir.  I just want to make sure she's comfortable and safe."" We help my aunt up, move the chair.  I turn to ask him again where we should go and he has stomped off.  Nice.  I am totally in love with this joint so far.  Finally, we are seated at 7:38.  Awesome.  We are seated at a circular booth.   A waitress comes, takes drink orders and disappears.  About 30 minutes later, we get drinks.  The place is packed, I will say that.  Lots of families... lots of families.  My mother gets her wine, white, as well as my aunt.  My mom's white wine is warm.  We wait another 20 minutes of flagging down the waitress for her to come over.  She then argues with my mother about what the temperature of her wine is.  At this point, I hate this place and I want to leave.   The menu is overwhelming with a million different things to order.  It's like a Chili's or Cheddars. I chose the grilled chicken.  Oh, look, it's previously frozen, shaped chicken.  Yum. Let's just say, I will never return.  The people there are not so nice and the food is not so awesome, either.  BJ's, you're not even good enough to be on my ""oh hell no"" list.  You're like that bad date that I want to pretend never happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=80
Code Name V.,"Austin, TX",52,33,35,5.0,10/11/2015,"I happened to come upon this establishment on the reccomendation and of a fellow bartender. This was my first visit and it was at the bar manned by a very capable and friendly bartender named Scotty. So I'm  aware BJs is a chain from CA but that doesn't mean they can't excell at what they do and it's obvious they do their own thing and do it well. BEER and PIZZA!!! They take it seriously here whether it's brewing their own craft beer, offering the best local options or customizing your own deep dish pizza. On Scotty's recomendation, my lovely companion and I  both agreed we had the best IPA we ever had in St. Arnolds double ipa Endeavor. Creamy, strong, and well bodied. Decadent!.  Speaking of, we also dined on root beer ribs (fell off the bone), buffalo wings (solid), and bj classic pizza thin crust style(very good). The bar and overall decor of the restaurant is comfortable and you can tell they put effort and allot of money in the design. Prices aren't bad either. I was a little surprised the other reviews were all over the place but I can only detail my experience.   Fun environment, great service, clever tv screens, superior bar food  and great beer sum up my BJ's experience.

I will never return to this location on boride lane. Came here to have dinner before catching movie at the Alamo draft house and unexpectedly waited 30 mins for our food to come out and being that there were only about 25 people in this place you'd think the wait wouldn't have been more than 20  mins. The guy that sat down 10 mins after we did had his food after about 10 mins. you would think someone would have offered some kind of pleasant offer for the wait but instead all we got was a walk by promise that our food was on its way out only to sit there another 15 mins hungry and by that time we had no choice but to leave so we wouldn't be late for the  movie.

The burgers came out wrong and by the time we saw our server again it was too late to really do anything about it. Whatever, I can forgive that. But the burgers themselves....oh god where do I start? Whoever thought that this was how burger meat was meant to taste was wrong...way wrong. It looked gross, it was way overcooked, and had next to no flavor. And I didn't think you could mess up placement of toppings this badly, but you can...bacon slices stacked on one side, the blue cheese barely crumbled and practically smooshed into the meat...and more..meh, it was REALLY disappointing.

The texture of it was weird and almost slimy. Not in an uncooked way. Its like the batter they used on it or something was just weird. It had way to much Lemon on it and the artichoke pieces were huge! All you taste was Lemon through out the whole thing and if it was not, it was the huge artichoke pieces....It just not as expected.

The staff are well managed, they are regimented and follow a system well that comes off as very professional.    However, the atmosphere is rather pretentious for a sports bar / ale house, and their prices match the air of snobbyness. Tell you what bj's... If you have paper kids menus at your restaurant, you're not that fancy.     Food- items ive had there: pizza, burger, fish tacos, salad. The pizza was terrible. Just a simple plain pizza that came out overly charred, little to no toppings and no flavor. All the other items were average, nothing to write home about. Congrats Bjs, you made a salad, hooray for you.     Beer - they have some decent house brews and a good selection of them, but I can get a dogfish 60 min or an independence ipa for the same price as their homebrew.....

Their beer is actually really good; way better than most of the Rock Bottoms I've been to.  Be sure to get the red, as it may be the best red I've had. The food is also really good, and the menu seems like it's a mile long.  Seriously, the toughest decision you'll have all day is what on earth you're in the mood for.  Pizza? Yeah, there's like five million styles and kinds. Burgers? Yes please.  Seafood? Beer battered of course. Pasta? All kinds. And it goes on and on...to dessert. If you somehow have room, and friendly assistants, get some form of Pizookie. And no, I'm not going to explain what on earth a Pizookie is, but you'll thank me later for getting one.

A. (who was unwilling to talk to me directly BTW) essentially said not his problem, and for me to call Eatoutin.  The folks at Eatoutin were very professional and called the restaurant with my complaint.  Mr. R. A. said he would credit two of the three wings but he ""personally saw"" the third dish wet that went with our delivery.  Are you kidding me!?!  The man lied, all to avoid a credit for a $12 dish??  We had three dry wing orders with virtually no sauce.   I will never go back to BJ's.  Ever!

The setting was very clean, the noise level was very nice for the time we were there (Approx 1pm).   Our Servers name was Lisa and she was such a cutie.  What a wonderful personality and very friendly.  She kidded with us and helped us understand the specials and Beer of the Day selections.  She made us feel very welcome to be there. The food came out fresh, hot and plated well.  My Wife ordered one of the Personal Pizza's and it looked great, and tasted great also.  She enjoyed both the size (Not too big, not too small, Just right!), and the Flavor.  She also had one of the Peach Beverages and she mentioned that it tasted very good.   I ordered the Bacon and Bleu Burger with wedge fries and I couldn't have been happier with it.  The Angus beef was done to my liking and the flavor combination was great.  Sometimes you get a burger like this and they tend to put too much Bleu Cheese on it and it gets overpowered.  This wasn't the case.  It had just the right amount of cheese, and bacon to make it a very enjoyable burger. Again, what made our visit to BJ's so enjoyable was our Server.  Lisa was funny, cute, entertaining and knowledgeable.  Her smile was nice to see, and it was real, not just for our table, but all the time.   When we dine out, whether it is a fast food stop, or a more elegant dining experience, or anything between, it's always a joy and a pleasure to have a positive experience across the board.  For this, we want to thank all the Staff at the Brodie location for showing up with their A-Game and making our visit fun, positive and enjoyable.

The service was good for a busy lunch rush. The second time was within the last 3 weeks with my family which include twin babies and some friends. I had the Rib-Eye steak which was a very tasty 14 oz steak I had medium well. It came with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The service was good. They had enough space to accommodate my babies . The restaurant was busy and perhaps that contributed to the server forgetting the drink and dessert I ordered. However, I still enjoyed the experience, nothing like good company and good food to compensate for inconsistencies in service! There's a lot of food items on the menu to please most and lots of space to appease all types of occasions.

Leila M.,"Austin, TX",304,175,711,3.0,2/6/2011,"As of now, I've been to BJ's four times. My review is a conglomeration of these four visits. BJs is a glorified ""holier than thou"" Chilis with a lot more real estate, AWESOME BEER AND ALE SELECTION and a sincere attempt of providing good customer service while food quality is diverse but not exactly better for the price.   1) first time visit I went with a friend, Jimmy. Appetizers were good, and the servers and waiters were EXTREMELY kind and professional, VERY hospitable but still managed to mess up my order.  I specifically said ""I Do Not Eat Pork"" and I ordered a wedge salad. The menu doesn't say the Iceberg Wedge Salad comes with bacon - but apparently, people don't understand pork = pig = bacon = ham.  I dismissed this and they probably dismissed it too because I was with a friend. Jimmy is a good friend and a big guy, he ate his salad and mine while I waited for my kosher one. I ended up having my over-cooked steak with bacon on the baked side potato too (which needed to be returned). Sucked but oh well. Like I said - big guy and good hungry friend. And first time there.  BTW - baked potatoes here are HUGE and well piled when you specify what you want on them.  They have an extensive menu of baked potatoes as a whole meal.  Oh, and PS - their Chili is not kosher either (it is pork).    2)  Second visit - came back here with a good group of friends and sat at bar. GREAT service! FULL BAR and an AMAZING selection of beers and ales and you name it.  I was very impressed.     3) Third visit: came to visit with my younger sister, hungry from soccer practice and since this is in my neck of the woods, took her to BJs. We both ordered the Iceberg Wedge Salad - ordered WITH NO BACON. She got a Turkey Burger and I ordered a MEDIUM RARE STEAK with a baked potato and again - with NO bacon.  Guess what happened? Both Wedge Salads had bacon, my baked potato had bacon and someone cooked the fark out of that steak until it was leather.  In all fairness, my sister LOVED her Turkey Burger w/ Avocado.  I tasted her wedge fries while I waited for the steak and salad and they were AWESOME! But management realized they messed up, not once but thrice, so I have to give them credit for comping a good part of the bill and providing a free desert. She left there happy (I don't eat sweets). So we went back....  4) Fourth visit  - went again with my sister this past weekend to give it another shot. She ordered the BJ's Burger with wedge fries and a side Iceberg Salad.  I ordered the Pot Roast Dish with a side Wedge Iceberg Salad.  I specifically told the waiter that WE DO NOT WANT BACON on the salads!! Whargharbl@!@!$  Guess what happened (suspense and drum roll) I actually had a  server other than our waiter put down TWO Iceberg Wedge Salads WITH (wait for it, wait for it....) BACON and say, ""Salads WITHOUT bacon"" in front of us! I was so dumbfounded I couldn't even respond to him. My sister suspected it but I wanted to give BJs the benefit of the doubt. We both laughed out loud!  Sure enough, our salads had bacon on them.  My  guess, miscommunication between kitchen, management, waiters and staff.   I know YOU probably love bacon, but I can't eat it. I just don't dig the pig. And if I request it not be on my salad, baked potato, or whatever, the kitchen should understand this. I've been very nice to this place so far because I really want to like it and I keep coming back. It's close by, the staff is awesome but sometimes they can be moronic, and I really like what they are trying to do - BUT I will NOT support the same mistake done again and again and again.  That is the definition of insanity.  GET IT RIGHT; after THREE  fails with the same client the client will call it quits.  Oh and on the food - again, BJs model is a hybrid between Cheescake Factory and Chilis. Still will return to see if I can Russian Roulette a favorite on their 20+ page menu, but so far, if you mess up a salad, I can't trust you on the main course, just yet.  I'll be back because their food is not too far away but my patience may wear thin if the same issue is repeated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=160

If you like beer, it is absolutely worth a try, even if you're a big food snob and you never go to chains.They brew their own beer and the samplers are very fun. There is sure to be one you'll want to try and they're generous with their sample sizes too (think cups not shot glasses).  I did actually eat something (ha) and that was nice as well. I ended up going with the Italian Market Salad which was really big and they didn't skimp on the ingredients. I hate when a restaurant serves me a salad and it's mostly iceberg lettuce with one tomato and one olive. Not so here. This is a great and filling salad that tasted really fresh and was covered in delicious olives and fresh mozzarella cheese plus artichokes and other veggies. It was super filling which was a pleasant surprise. Despite all this food and beer there was also room left for dessert so we gave their ""Pizookie"" a try. Stupid as the name is, this thing is freaking tasty. It's basically a freshly baked cookie sitting in a deep dish like a pizza and topped with ice cream. It's deliciously soft. You can't go wrong with this thing. Trust me. All in all this is a satisfying chain restaurant. I'm definitely liking it a lot more than other similar counterparts (Chilis, TGIFriday's etc.) and I'd definitely come back to try a red velvet Pizookie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=180
Daniel M.,"Austin, TX",0,29,2,4.0,1/30/2012,"My wife and I will go there probably more than any other place if we are just looking to have a night out. Love the TVs they always have sports tuned in and if you sit in the bar area most of the time you can just walk in and sit. They do get very busy in a flash so not always. They also have a reservation number you can call if you want to make sure you have a seat when you arrive. Very polite and accommodating staff.  The last waiter we had seemed nice enough although maybe overwhelmed in the rush that arrived shortly after we did. I only say this because we had to flag him down more than once which I don't like to do...I understand getting busy but never forget about a customer! This is not the norm here but was worth mentioning. I love the selection of beers they have: lights, darks, exotics (or seasonal), They have always been informative when I wanted to try something new, explaining the favor and such.  The food is pretty good overall as well. My personal favorite is the Chicken Alfredo!! So good! This last time I got the Parmesan crusted chicken and mashed potatoes. The chicken was cooked really good, soft and moist with a lemon sauce that was perfect with it. The potatoes, while real, left something to be desired because they had no flavor...throw something in...cheese, butter, salt, anything. My wife really enjoys the lettuce wraps on their appetizer menu. The artichoke and spinach dip was awesome, a must try. I don't even like spinach and I enjoyed this dish.

Ted S.,"Austin, TX",2,29,,3.0,1/10/2012,"This is a good place to eat ""good"" food.  It's not fancy and some things I find questionable in popularity.  I was told the deep dish pizza was quite good but found it way too doughy.  The avocado eggrolls are really good though and so are the salads.  In my experience eating here, seven out of ten times I have experienced a good quality/value/atmosphere.  The other times not so much....but it's just a chain so my expectations aren't really too high. One thing that I did find really annoying is the policy on call ahead reservations.  My family arrived without reservations one busy evening and I was told that the wait was about 20 minutes, which was fine.  I expect a plus or minus of a bit, but when 30 minutes passed and I asked about our table, I was told that several parties that had called ahead had arrived and our place was taken, (at least four times) by these other parties.  Our wait time was about 50 min.  We never would have stayed had we known our wait time was over half an hour.  I think it best to either have a reservation policy or don't, but don't punish waiting customers by extending their wait times more than double the initial time estimate.  If it wasn't for the starving kid we would have left.  It's a good place but not much more than a 20 minute wait kind of good. The same night we had the long wait was one of the three times that was really poor in terms of both service and food.  It appears as though they can't handle busy.  If they aren't overly busy it's three stars and if are it's one to two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=180
Jen F.,"Dallas, TX",2,27,4,4.0,1/9/2012,"This has to be my favorite chain restaurant ever! Having only been twice before, after an amazing lunch experience yesterday, I can't believe that I forgot how good BJ's is. I had one of their flatbread pizza and salad lunch combos, which was very good and affordable ($7). The salad had a tasty vinaigrette dressing and the club pizza was crisp and perfectly seasoned. Also, the calamari was outstanding, as was my husband's jalapeno burger (which I managed to snag a bite of before it was devoured). Our waitress was incredibly sweet and refilled my sweet tea several times without missing a beat. But the absolute best part of the DAY was the cookies and cream pizookie we had for dessert. To call this thing a ""cookie"" would be a gross understatement. Think the texture of a perfectly cooked brownie, mixed with the taste of a not-too-chocolately cookie fresh from the oven, then add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a hint of cookies & cream, and that still won't do this dessert justice. I definitely recommend BJ's as an easy settlement to the endless ""Where should we go eat"" debate, as their menu easily accommodates a range of taste preferences (and vegetarians). But I would also (will also) swing by on those ""I just need a pick-me-up dessert"" days too.  Don't hold BJ's chain status against it.

The interior is pretty classy and comfortable for a chain, I'll give them that.  It's very loud though, doesn't make for a good conversation spot.  We waited about 30-40 minutes for a table.  I saw a waiter handing out free slices of pizza to some of the patrons who were waiting.  Where was MY pizza?!?  I digress.... The waiter informed me that they are known for their craft beers and pizza.  Unlucky for them I don't care about craft beers and I don't like Chicago style pizza.  Ha.  The menu was huge and that usually means that a restaurant can't focus in on one thing and do it superbly so they muck up their menu with eleventy billion random options, which is what it looked like to me.  The chicken fried steak was okay, but I could do better at home.  The mashed potatoes and vegetables that came with it were sorta bland.  The only thing I really liked is the portion size.  I got 2 meals out of my $13 investment on that steak.  I might return here for lunch to give it another shot.  Oh and the drink prices were RIDIC!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=180

Admittedly I ordered something simple, and it does seem like if you sit closer to the bar (which I did this time) you're likely to get more attention from what turned out to be an eager waiter.  I tried a roast chicken dish that was a) pretty massive and therefore impossible to finish and b) pretty decent, actually.

BJ's menu is huge, they offer a selection of special beers (note: they imply that it is made in-house but this is not a 'true' brewpub from what I can tell), and the atmosphere is ""huge sports bar"" with TVs blaring various games from around the restaurant. Kind of schizophrenic in a way: plush wood panelling with romantic lighting overwrought by NFL bleats and bleeps from the huge plasmas. I have to admit that I like the side Ceasar salad and the Turkey Cobb sandwich lunch special (half sandwich and salad for $6.95). However, the baked potato entree is huge and mealy - definitely seemed like an Archer-Daniels-Midland mutant genetically-modified 'product' rather than real food. The topping on the potato was non-existent; I had to ask my long-absent waitress to take it back and 'do it over.' The beer was so-so which is disappointing for a place that makes a big deal of its beer. I had the 'kolsch"" which at ""BJ's"" (eh hem...snicker) is really more of a pilsner. Kolsch is not common in the USA so I can forgive them on their mistake, I guess. The cookie like thing they serve with ice cream for dessert is good but a tad pricey (I think it was like $7!). They worst thing about a visit to BJ's is that the service is a total mess. It takes FOREVER to get acknowledged by a waitperson. More often than not, they screw up your order, overcharge you and/or forget stuff like silverware, water, refills, etc. This has happened on ALL four visits I've made to this place. The thing that REALLY pisses me off is that I ALWAYS get my salad course served WITH my entree. What gives with this? I can either send back the entree (where it sits under a heat lamp) or just accept the horrible service and eat on. Maybe it is a new MBA-manager way of turning over tables more often?? This SUCKS! It would be one thing if BJ's were cheap (...snicker) but, hey, this is a place where it can cost $20 for a beer, side salad, and sandwich with tip. They need to train their staff to at be at LEAST as competitive as other chains, like Chili's, Chuck E. Cheese, or the hot dog stand at Costco's.  Two stars (barely). Avoid going unless your boss is paying. Be prepared for waitstaff that can't do their job. Management seems to be MBA-types who care more about 'metrics' than customer service.

I had the chicken fried steak, living in Texas all my life I've learned that if you not sure about a place you get the chicken fried steak and sure enough it was a winner.

The 5 minutes would not have been too big a deal normally, but already waiting over 10, telling the girls at the hostess stand and still getting less than par service, I stood up, told the manager, who was behind us, what was going on.

Also it took forever to get any condiments. My guess is once the waiter knew we had a coupon, he stopped giving a crap. He was MIA much of the time.

Lauren S.,"West Campus, Austin, TX",0,12,5,1.0,4/24/2014,"ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE EVER. Upon our first visit there last June, we had a terribly rude waitress, not sure of her name, but she was blonde and oblivious. Our pizookie came out completely raw (I love chewy cookies, but with this one- I'm talking warmed up cookie dough), so we sent it back. She brings us our check and takes the pizookie off of our tab...but not another pizookie like we had asked. I left a note on the receipt saying she had ignored us, and while we were waiting patiently for a pizookie from the to-go area, our waitress COMES UP TO ME like a girl in high school and tells me if I would have just ""confronted"" her, she would have solved the issue. No apology.  Fast forward to April, when we were in the neighborhood, were starving, and my boyfriend just wanted a burger. We go in, sit down, and after 10 minutes of waiting in an EMPTY restaurant, a familiar looking blonde girl comes over and awkwardly asks for our drink orders. We go ahead and order, and I try to be polite and friendly just in case it wasn't the same waitress. Even if it was, I would still have been kind, you know? Well, the next morning my boyfriend is missing his debit card. We call BJ's and the manager insists there are no cards with his name on it. Fishy, since we know for a fact we didn't drop it after coming home. A few days later, mysterious charges appear on his card- at the HEB on South Congress, the Whataburger off of Ben White, and Exxon gas station in the area- come on. If someone were to snatch it from our side of town, they probably would not have been trying to use a stolen debit card SURROUNDING THIS BJ'S. Who it could have been that stole the card there, we don't know. Absolutely AWFUL establishment. We'll be chewing out the manager shortly and writing a report to the company.

Michelle C.,"Austin, TX",741,636,148,4.0,3/13/2009,"If this restaurant were in central Austin, I would never choose to go, and it would get three stars.  But luckily for BJ's, the other choices in the vicinity (which is where my office happens to be) are very limited, so I've bumped my 3.5 star assessment up to 4. So if you're out south in the Sunset Valley area, and you're looking for a experience that is more or less non-controversial amongst a crowd of average Americans, BJ's isn't half bad.  They have a menu the size of Webster's (unabridged), so there's a little something for everyone.  They have home brew, a terrific selection of other beers (hello, Pyramid Apricot), a full bar, and homemade root beer and cream soda.  They have pizza, and chicken, and salads, and meat loaf, and burgers, and pasta, and stuffed potatoes, and flat panel TV's, and tall ceilings. They have parking. It's overpriced.  You may have to wait a while for a table - and you may have to wait twice as long as they say you will, as we did today when a group of us went for lunch and had to wait 30 minutes when they said 15 (however, they did come out with some free slices of their homemade pizza to appease us, which did help).  Then you may have to wait an inordinately long time for your food (lunch today took two hours, and it was not because we were eating slowly).  Service is basically cheerful, but nothing here seems to happen quickly. Portion sizes are ginormous.  YMMV on the food.  I thought the pizzas were pretty tasty; I tried both the deep dish and a thin-crust, appetizer-sized one.  The parmesan crusted chicken was plentiful, moist and delicious, although I found the white cheddar mashed potatoes that were served with it to be utterly bland.  I've also tasted the meatloaf (yum), the bruschetta (yawn), and the shrimp tacos (actively disappointing - not enough shrimp, and the tortillas were too strongly flavored and too dry to stand up to the shrimp).   Basically, a step up from Bennigan's, with homemade beer.  You probably won't go home and rave about anything that happens here.  But there probably won't be any wringing of hands or gnashing of teeth, either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=240

Never have I been to BJ's where the waitress hasn't taken at least 10 minutes to bring back our drink order (whether there is alcohol or not). I have also never been asked if I wanted a refill without asking first. The waiters/waitresses seem to think people fall into two categories: those who know exactly what they want when they walk in the door, and those who are such dullards they need AT LEAST 20 minutes to look over the menu to decide what they want. I am also going to recommend to anyone reading this that you DO NOT try the Pumpkin Ale. It might taste like pumpkin, but not the pumpkin pie-y deliciousness you would imagine (and they advertise). Instead it goes over your tongue with almost no effect on your taste buds whatsoever, except for a horrible aftertaste similar to pumpkin pie that has been left out of the fridge.....for a week.  If you're in the mood for dinner to take at least two hours, aren't really that thirsty, know exactly what you want to order when you walk in the door and like being ignored, come on down to BJ's - where the waitstaff hates you, and they aren't afraid to show it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=240
Pizza H.,"Austin, TX",39,40,,4.0,2/18/2011,"So we were visiting some friends on a trip to San Francisco and the topic turned to pizza as it always does when we are around.  Our buddy hails from the Motor City as well and had relocated to the bay area a few years ago.  As we were openly complaining and comparing stories of fu-fu Cali pizza and the over abundance of NY style or thin pizza's...he mentions to us that BJ's makes a pretty good deep dish that reminded him of Detroit Style pizza a bit.  Our ears perked up and we knew then that we needed to try the restaurant chain that we had never been to before.  (Why would we have really?). Hours later we were sitting in a BJ's Brewhouse watching some football and waiting for this pizza to hit our table.  It arrives and it's clear they took some inspiration from a big national chain that makes a pan pizza.  Upon tasting the pizza though we can say that it's a bit different in terms of taste and texture.   For one they are pretty liberal with their cheese and they like to spread it right up to the pan so you get a bit of that caramelized cheese effect (that's where the Detroit style comes into play here).  Another thing that BJ's does that works is the dough is indeed thick, but it's on the lighter and airy side for a deep dish.  That's a huge plus in our books and kudo's to them for their dough.   The big thick round aluminum (or is it steel?) pans bake these bad boys up really nice in our opinions.   Back to the cheese.  It's a good quality mozzarella blend (I swear I tasted some provolone in the blend too). It's not overly greasy which is good, because the dough from these pizza's are often greasy enough.   Now the sauce is a touchy subject at BJ's.  There typical pie comes topped with diced tomatoes and no red sauce.  We requested a pizza without the tomato's but with their house red sauce.  It's decent, a little on the spicy side, but acceptable.   We scarfed down the medium pie and called it a night after eating one of their cookie desserts. Looking back on our experience at BJ's I feel comfortable stating that these guys are doing a good job at putting out a good pizza in a chain type setting.  We liked the feel of the place, it was comfortable and inviting.  We have been back since we came back to Austin (they had one here, who knew?) and it has been consistently good.   If you are looking for a precious artisan pizza stay away, but if you are after a hearty pie, dig in.  And oh...they just might be the reigning king of chain pizzas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=240

I've also enjoyed their fish/shrimp tacos and of course their avocado egg rolls. I don't care for their pasta as much, but I'm Italian so I'm pretty picky about my pastas.  Their seasonal beers are usually pretty good so give those a try and they've got some good year round brews as well.

The burger was okay. I can think of a few other places I'd rather get one from, but here I was. Ha. The shitheap of ingredients didn't add very much to the burger as far as taste.

Name aside, I think the place is pretty good.    I usually end up getting the cuban burger with the skinny fries or the pizza.   Both are pretty phenomenal.   The burger could be a little less greesy, but then it would probably suck.   I really like their take on pizza - in fact, Id put it up in the top 5 places in Austin. Their beers are ""OK,"" but its a bit of an expensive place for happy hour.   I think their pints are like 4 bucks each, but thats off the top of my head, so dont quote me on that. The atmosphere is nice... the waiters and waitresses do their job well and it comes across a bit more ""upscale"" than traditional chain brewpub-ish places.   I think its a good thing that this place can stand on its own rather than going the ""hooker"" outfits that many similar style restaurants do in town.

He told us we would have to tell our waiter. He comes back with my and the boys non-alcoholic drinks an we continue to look through the menu. About 25 minutes later we are still sitting there... waiting... waiting... No one comes to get alcohol orders. No one asks anything. My boyfriend went to the host stand and sought out a manager. The manager came back and brought back Evelyn a really nice server. She took our order and everything came out pretty prompty. I think everything tasted well enough. I wasn't impressed like this was the best meal ever, but it was better than more than 90 percent of the chains out there. We also had the giant cookie that was baked in a pan.  When everything was said and done, we were satisfactory, but still saddened about the LONG wait for someone to address or take care of us.... Needless, the manager comped the entire meal. It was above and beyond what was necessary. As a manager myself, I know something free is nice... the entire meal is crazy. Thanks for the meal.

I suppose it was initial excitement caused by a new dining option in SW Austin (case in point: the ridiculous wait times at the new Chuy's at MoPac/Wm. Cannon), because the craziness has died down since then.  I've been three times now--all at lunchtime--and have had very good service and tasty, well-prepared food.

You're not going to find local charm, but you will find the comfortable consistency that is the ultimate goal of strip-mall chains.  This particular location seemed to be well managed, they have the lunch-crowd routine down and handled our large group with ease. I probably will not be frequenting here for HH or to watch games (I tend to prefer local dives), though it seems to be a good spot to occasionally meet your more businesslike colleges for an after-work brew. I had the flat-bread pizza, and it was tasty enough. No one in the group had any complaints about the food quality. The wait staff were efficient enough to be almost invisible (perfect in this type situation) Some in the group were unhappy with the automatic 17% added to the bills for large group, though that has become common practice and probably even cost her a couple of bucks.

Chad S.,"West Chester, PA",64,101,27,2.0,12/8/2007,"Experience #1 at BJ's was subpar.  I walked in a little before 10pm on a Thursday night....place like that, I figure the kitchen will still be humming, and I'll be able to get out of there with some takeout pretty quickly.  Mmmmyeeeeaahh. There was a takeout counter right inside the front door, stocked with menus...perfect. Quick glance at the menu, I'm thinking sandwiches are the call - quick and tasty, hard to foul up.  I'm standing there, eyeing the digs....not bad, but definitely with a chain feel. New and clean, so that doesn't hurt...pretty good size bar with plenty of TVs around and one huge screen in the middle. So far, so good. Five minutes later, still standing there, drumming my fingers on the counter, not so good.  I was beginning to wonder if the sign around my neck that said HUNGRY CUSTOMER READY TO GIVE YOU MONEY FOR FOOD was readable. Was I....clean?   Check.  Fully clothed?  Check.  Sober?  Meh...it's a ""brewhouse"", so that shouldn't matter. A little waitress finally wanders over and says...""Do you want to order take out?""  I resist the urge to say the first 10 things that come to mind, and instead reply with an affirmative ""yeah.""  ""Oh, well you can do that at the bar."" Bitch, if you would have told me that 10 minutes ago, I could have been 2 pints deep by now. So, I head over to the bar and sit down right in front of the huge screen to watch a little Thursday night NFL (props for having the network, but I couldn't care less about the Skins-Bears...no fantasy implications, and my season tanked with Larry Johnson anyway).  After a few minutes of watching two bartenders fart around wiping things and whatnot, I stand up, lean forward, and bust out the evil eye.  It worked, and I got the sampler...4 beers, dark to light, all decent, none great, favorite was the pale.  Ordered a couple of sandwiches and the avocado egg rolls.  Mmmmm, avocados deep fried.  No deals. They're out of the avocado egg rolls.  So, I read the blitz and audible at the line to Southwest spring rolls, but the blitz got through and my arse got sacked. I finish the sampler about 10 or 15 minutes later, but still no food.  So, I thrust the pale ale glass at the tender and tell him ""MORE"".  I had already paid, but he understood the unspoken ""you will give me more beer now without charging me, and continue doing so until my food comes, and like it.""  He complied (+1 star). The food finally came out 25 minutes after I placed the order.  Sorry, but I could have gone into the kitchen, figured out where everything was and made two sandwiches myself in less time.  On top of that, both were $9.25, and both were just okay (turkey cobb and blackened chicken)...I was hoping $9.25 would get me a big ass kick ass sanny.  Not the case.  The seasoned wedge fries and southwest egg rolls ($8.25) were totally unmemorable, and in hindsight I really should have audibled to something else, but my mind was set on avocado egg rolls, so I went with the next closest thing. When all was said and done, I was out $40 with tax and tip...kicking myself for not just going home and chewing on some celery with a cold Newcastle.  I'm sure dining in would be a different experience, and granted, it's tough to judge by the limited dip into the menu I took, but BJ's seems pretty overpriced for what you get.  I stopped here based on convenience and curiosity (okay, thirst too), but if I'm going to spend that kind of dough, I'd way rather do it somewhere locally owned with better service, better beer, better food and a better vibe.

Q J.,"Austin, TX",0,60,,1.0,3/25/2013,"I first visited this place a while ago. I honestly don't recall how things were except that their wedged potatoes were very greasy and salty. Went there for lunch again today with a group of people and I don't think I want to return, even though the French fries on some plates looked much better than the wedged potatoes. Service -- Laughable. Apparently another guy at a different table ordered the same item (half pizza with side salad). The kitchen screwed up and plated the whole pizza on one plate. And apparently the plate was set in front of the guy before the wait stuff realized the mistake and snatched it up again. Anyhow our waiter brought me the plate (with the whole pizza) and told me about the mistake (including the fact that it was rescued from in front of the other customer). He then proceeded to suggest he would half the pizza for us and bring me a side salad later. So as I watched he took the pizza plate to a table, slid half of the pizza onto an empty plate, and then? He brought me back the original pizza plate, half of which was occupied by the half pizza and the other half covered with crumbs and remains of the other half. It looked as if someone has eaten half of the pizza and handed me the leftover! Come on, what kind of restaurant does stuff like this? I understand mistakes happen, but at least he could have taken the pizza back to the kitchen and ask them to divide it and re-plate. I've never had a bizarre experience like this! Food -- I ordered a lunch special, a half roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread pizza and a side salad. The pizza barely had any very thinly sliced zucchini and was very lightly sprinkled with tiny bits of goat cheese. They used quite a lot of pesto to compensate for the lack of topping. So basically I got greasy flatbread and pesto. The side salad was as basic as it could get, bunch of wild greens with 2 very sad looking tomato wedges. The guy sitting next to me ordered a regular deep dish pizza, presumable lunch size. When they bought it to him I thought it was a joke. It literally looks like something from a kid's menu, actually smaller than the kid size pizza in many other places. For that one they seemed to use extra oil  soaked into the crust to make it up for the tiny size, so hopefully the guy didn't walk away from his lunch still hungry. Never going back there. There are way too many other better restaurants in this town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=280
Larry V.,"Austin, TX",30,195,357,3.0,1/17/2008,"My first experience at BJs was early dinner on Thursday evening with four other humans, also there for the first time. The dcor is very interesting, with light and dark wood planks alternating in the floor to create a striped surface, dark wood wall panels and posts, with nostalgic lighting throughout, an impressive bar, plenty of table seating, and huge plasma screens stuck everywhere. It still looks new and clean, which is very nice. There is a carry out area at the end of the bar just inside the front doors, too, which I'll keep in mind for the future. The atmosphere is definitely intended to be ""sports bar,"" but it was pretty nice family dining while we were there. Since it was early dinner, it wasn't crowded at all, and it was actually even pretty quiet. There was music playing quietly in the background, sports events were displayed on some of the TVs, but the sound was not on, and there was even a kid's channel on one TV, which was a good thing, because there were lots of families there, and the children were being entertained by the cartoon program which they couldn't hear. That doesn't really matter, though. Kids have such vivid imaginations they don't have to have sound with their visual stimulants. There were also three or four couples with infants enjoying some time out, maybe for the first time since the baby was born. BJ's has an impressive menu. I don't mean the food. I mean the size of the menu. They have about five or six pages of brews, and about that many more of food items. They offer a vast selection of special beers, some of the names I recognized, but most I didn't. Two in our party ordered beers, and one of them asked for a slice of lemon after tasting the beer, and squeezed the juice into it. I asked how it was, and he said, ""Eh!"" The prices here are all a bit higher than you might expect, but the food portions aren't skimpy. It's probably pricey enough that it isn't a routine stop just for comfort food and a beer. Our food, though, was good. Between us we had four different entrees, the favorite being the deep dish pizza, followed by the California Burger on sourdough, BBQ Chicken Sandwich on whole wheat bread, and the steak sandwich on wheat, each of them with the seasoned wedge fries. We only had one surprise, and that was that the BBQ Chicken sandwich came with a sweet slaw on the sandwich and the BBQ sauce served on the side. Not that it was bad, it was just different, and like I said, a surprise. I'm not sure that I would order it again, but that's just personal tastes.   They do offer a 5"" cookie/two scoops of ice cream dessert, and they offered to make our half and half, so everyone in our party would be treated to the kind of dessert they like. Ours came out in just a few minutes, and the cookie was indeed oatmeal raisin on one side and chocolate chip on the other, and was hot enough it was melting the ice cream. Fortunately, it was served with four spoons, so we were able to enjoy the ice cream while it was still solid enough to eat. The cookie, however, disappeared even before the ice cream did, and it was quite tasty, indeed. All in all, the meals and drinks were under $20 per person, and the service was good. We were seated and served in a timely manner, and our server was friendly and attentive. We'll go back, but it will probably be for lunch or early dinner. I don't think we would enjoy BJs at the time of day some of the other folks have reviewed them. We've already sowed our wild oats, and we have the surgery scars to prove it.   :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=280

Dark wood, ginormous beer selection (including locals, YAY Live Oak!) about 12 screens displaying mostly sports. I think this is where families will go when Dad gets to pick the restaurant. That being said, they had a very extensive menu, burgers, steaks, seafood, and lots of salads. My husband had grilled salmon, which he enjoyed, my daughter had a $9. angel hair pasta dish with feta cheese and pine nuts, I had the veggie cheese burger with really tasty thick cut fries. Yum. The enormity of the room made it not my cup-of-tea, but my family really liked it, which counts for alot.  Energetic, peppy, wait staff includes adorable looking young men and women who seemed to enjoy grooving around to the oldies music (read - 80's and 90's!)  Back to the beer. My spousal-unit is a foodie and a big beer snob, and he loves to experiment. We saw lots of brands we recognized from a recent trip to Ireland, and I loved the fact that they serve slender ""taster"" sizes.

My. Lord.  I think this might have been one of the best desserts I've ever eaten.  Seriously. It was that good.  Mind you, I'm a big cookie fan, especially warm cookies.  And with ice cream on top???  Heaven.   I think that dessert left me with a sense of ""Wow, this is an awesome restaurant!""   Then I decided to make a return visit.   You wouldn't think a Wednesday night would be a busy night and that it would be hard to get a table, but we waited longer to be seated than we did on our last Saturday visit.  We ordered some potstickers and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  A runner brought them out, but we had no plates, so we both had to lean over the giant table and hover.  I made sure to order our entrees the next time the waiter zoomed by, and it took quite a long time for them to arrive.  My son got the buffalo chicken pizza again and loved it.  He did not receive a plate (again) with his order.  I got the balsamic-glazed chicken this time, and it was actually quite tasty.  As other reviewers have stated, the portions are huge.  Since there were only 2 of us this time, and since my son said he would NOT have room for dessert, we decided against the pizookie, and I'm still regretting that decision.   All in all, quite a mixed bag here.  I think the pizookie is the saving grace for this place, from my sweet-toothed standpoint. :)  Wish I woulda had one on that second visit.   Pros: beers, dessert Cons: service, prices way too high",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=300

She started off by saying that the next time we come to Bj's, I should order my steak well done as they go by temperature. She then proceeded to say that the steak temperature was 148 and that is medium well but that she had them put it back on the grill for a minute. The correct temperature for a steak to be medium well is 155-165 per several websites and other cooks that I know. The waiter was appalled and said that he goes by color.

Eva G.,"Austin, TX",0,8,,1.0,2/18/2012,"I was recently extremely disappointed with my first attempt to visit your restaurant. My family came to Austin for the wknd & we hoped to treat them to your spot. I have a 2yr old & imn7 months pregnant so I hoped that arriving at 6 & being told we only had a 20 minute wait would make for a good experience. However, after waiting an hour and watching several large parties get seated before us because they called in, I asked to speak with a manager. His response to our situation was they are trying their best but we still needed to wait for 2 additional large parties to be seated. This is in addition to the hour we already spent waiting. If we were told upon arrival that our wait would have been so long we would've decided against it, but we foolishly waited w an infant & toddler thinking that we would be seated ""soon"". I'm terribly disgusted with this experience & will express my opinion online so other families might save themselves from miserable family evenings at your venue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=300

Ernesto M.,"Austin, TX",0,2,1,2.0,4/12/2012,We live in the area and have driven by BJ's multiple times. Today we finally decided to go there for dinner. Nice place.  I ordered one of their pasta dinners and the pasta was pretty raw. The noodles were stuck together and crunchy. They fixed it and brought out a new order after the other people at the table had finished their meal. Then I ordered a second beverage and ten minutes later the server came and said there was trouble with the pump and the beer was coming out too foamy and they had spent the last ten minutes trying to figure out what was wrong.   All I can say is my first experience didn't leavee with a good impression to want to return any time soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=320
Debra M.,"Austin, TX",34,3,,2.0,4/3/2010,"First the good points are at the particular time I went the greeter was very nice.  The cashier at the take out register and manager were super nice to me.  I liked the atmosphere.  Bad points:  The food is very generic.  I should have read these reveiws sooner because the fish tacos are in fact a lot like fish sticks in stale tortillas.  I bought nachos for my husband, and he pretty much loves nachos and will eat them from wherever I get them from, even if he doesn't like them so much.  He had a few bites of this and left the rest.  I'll probably never go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=320
Joe M.,"Austin, TX",0,33,,3.0,8/23/2009,"First the good: Service was excellent, food was fresh, ice tea was clear & foamy (my #1 indicator that they maintain cleanliness). My wife's root beer was tasty. The restaurant was clean with plenty of big screen TVs. I ordered the Spinach/Artichoke heart individual pizza. It was below average, especially given that BJs features pizza. It was deep dish featuring mainly bread, very doughy. The toppings were finely chopped, not chunks like I would prefer. They were good, there simply wasn't enough. The artichoke hearts were fragments, barely enough to capture the flavor. My House salad was fresh, but was mainly iceberg lettuce (at least I got my fiber for the day!). The Balsamic Vinegarette dressing was tasty.  The bar area had plenty of sports with multiple screens. There were also screens in the dining area, but were mounted a little too high, so this wouldn't be my first choice tor watching a sporting event. Overall Great Service & below average food results in an average rating. Note BJs offers 7 different home brews that looked interesting, but my wif, err I wasn't in the mood for a beer. Cheers, Joe Mac",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=320
Krishelle L.,"Austin, TX",62,185,5,4.0,11/19/2008,"While the food here is fairly mediocre and very greasy, I did manage to find many positives about my two experiences at BJs.  First trip was back last Winter. We had the deep dish pizza and loaded fries. The fries were greasy as expected. The pizza was greasier than expected (although tasty) and also mostly bread, which I do not consider a true deep dish pizza. I like mine with more cheese. The house beers were good, I especially loved the light and bubbly berry cider.  Second trip was just this past weekend to watch the UT football game. We sat at the bar. The picture on the  multipiece big screen was not the best, but it was okay. Service was excellent and drink options were far better than what I am used to while watching UT football. I had a bloody mary and a spiked iced coffee cocktail in addition to the great home brews on tap. The food again was greasy fare that I had expected, but again, better selections than most sports bars.  So overall I give this place 4 stars due to the unique and large variety of drinks, friendly service, and better food options compared to other sports bars. In other words, the bar gets 4 stars. The restaurant probably only deserves a 3 at best",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-sunset-valley?start=320

After putting in another order, we waited another 15mins, and still nothing. By the time we got her plate the rest of us had already finished, and she just wanted to leave, and take hers to go. The waiter was very apologetic, and the manager did compensate us for the troubles by giving us a gift-card. I will say we all enjoyed our food.

Nicole P.,"Austin, TX",0,28,2,1.0,6/15/2013,"Not impressed! We had an earlier dining experience here in the year, that was (to say nicely) mediocre. We decided to give this place another try and besides we were only going in for dessert and drinks. My family and I had finished a night of shopping and decided we wanted something sweet to wrap up the evening. First, I must say the bar area was hopping and the dining area pretty empty for 9:30pm. We were seated with only ONE menu and it took the server 5 minutes to even acknowledge us. When he finally graced us with his service we each ordered water and as I began to ask him a question about a sparkling strawberry bar drink he cut me off in mid sentence and said in a frustrated tone ""I'll be back, let me go get your waters!""  He returned another 6 minutes later ONLY to quickly drop the waters and run off before we could even make eye contact much less order anything! As my 6 year old daughter went to take a drink of her water she noticed lip stick on the rim of her glass and realized the glass was too heavy for her to pick up and slightly spilled some water on the table. She looked up at me and said ""Mom, why didn't he give me a kid cup with a lid?"" GREAT question!!! After another 3 minutes we decided we didn't want to give this guy a single cent of our money. From my observation, they pay more attention to their bar patrons than their dining patrons. So we jumped up and went next door where we ended our evening with satisfied bellies and great big smiles!

The food is more tailored for a brew pub, filling and delicious. And yes, it has the atmosphere of a ""brew pub"", as it should. Fish tacos are a favorite but everything is always good, if a bit on the heavy side. (That brew pub food.) I find the pizza good but I am not a fan of  ""Chicago"" style pizza with a thick crust.

You could eat there and spend about 40 dollars on beer that is just okay and get a pizza and a salad or get a rotiserie chicken, pizza, and large salad and eat it at home with your own beer without the annoying music blaring.
