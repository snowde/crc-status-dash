Rhonda W.,"Corona, CA",36,39,21,5.0,8/3/2017,"I have to give the manager props for being who she is. Very sweet and very professional. I made a mistake on my order and didnt see the burger sauce listed on the menu. So my bad when I had them take off everything but the sauce. )= So I didnt like the burger. Again, my fault. I did not ask for it removed due to my mistake and when asked if I wanted something else, I passed. Manager on the floor came up and apologized and insisted that I not leave hungry. She wanted me to be happy and full. I finally gave in and ordered  a single deep dish pizza with the fixins. Excellent choice by the way!  So long story short, burger was taken off and so was the pizza. I was taken back by that and told the server that they shouldn't have removed the food from bill. She said the manager insisted since I had to wait for my food. Talk about professionalism from the facility and the kindness and sweetness from her.  I went and found her on my way out and thanked her and gave her a hug. Need more people like her in this world.  Thank you....

Eddie W.,"Upland, CA",105,47,63,2.0,11/10/2017,"In a past life I was a bartender. I completely understand being busy. I remember my first St Patrick's day both of the bars (the place I worked had one on each floor) ran out of ice. Needless to say I have empathy for wait staff and bartenders. But seriously, waiting at an unbused bar table for 20 minutes even after a waitress said ""We'll get that cleaned off for you."" a minute after I sat down seems understandable but not necessarily the best example of organized, well-managed service. I get it, it's Friday, Veterans Day...but 20 minutes?  My only suggestion would be to increase staff by one or two during holiday promotions times might be a plausible solution. This review serves as a note to management rather than bad review of wait staff on a busy night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula
Joe T.,"Temecula, CA",0,466,44,2.0,10/29/2017,"We came in on Saturday for ""brunch"" around 12pm. 1.  Lemon Thyme Chicken-  Ordered with no bell peppers.  First time served, it came out as some totally different dish,  not what was ordered at all and WITH bell peppers.  The server immediately noticed this and took it back.  Had to wait just a couple of minutes for the correct item to be served and it was the right item but again served WITH bell peppers.  :-( 2.  California Scramble with Hatch Green Chils.  Barely 1 egg worth of scrambled eggs on it (I think it said 3?) and funny, I know, but this had NO Hatch green chilis within the dish at all. (I like peppers, she doesn't).  Hatch chilis are the BOMB! 3.  Southern Comfort Crispy Chicken Sandwich- YUM.  This was the best dish of all really good.  Excellent flavors, yummy fries.   Bottom line, the place wasn't that busy to have menu errors.  It's probably good for pizza.  Not so sure on other items due to this visit. *Note that the Manager did apologize and comp the Thyme Chicken due to the errors.  Thanks for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula

Blair H.,"Hemet, CA",2,150,443,5.0,12/23/2017,"It's been a while we came to this location but this last visit was very good indeed. We tried the Ahi Poke appetizer and chicken lettuce wraps for the first time and the family liked them. The cheese deep dish pizza was good as well as the pita shrimp tacos. Service is always great so no complaints there. We didn't stay as long as we wanted to because we had so many holiday errands to run, so we didn't even order desert. But for a fun and quick dinner stop it was actually a delicious experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula
Luis C.,"Perris, CA",0,1,4,2.0,10/21/2017,Worst customer service ever. Spilled water didn't bother to clean it up spilled chips left them on the table I'm guessing for us to eat them off the table. Found I don't know what in the ranch. I don't know but other restaurants seem to be way better then this way over priced for this wasn't worth it.  UPDATE: I have to say thank you to the manager for contacting me and trying to make what happened to me and my wife right. I appreciate the fact that you took the time to contact me personally.

Annie P.,"Murrieta, CA",0,36,,2.0,1/10/2018,"We didn't have the whole experience as we had our food delivered by a delivery service. We ordered three rather pricey pizzas from BJ's and pretty much got three boxes of cooked pizza dough, very tasty bread it was, but sadly lacking much in the way of toppings. Very little cheese or sauce on any of the three, but interestingly enough quite a bit of tough overcooked chicken on two of the pizzas. I do realize that one delivery order doesn't give much of an overview of what a restaurant offers though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula
Kathy N.,"San Diego, CA",80,257,3061,2.0,2/22/2017,"ughhhh BJs in general has a great menu for big groups and families but oh man this BJs in Temecula has some work to do on training their service staff / waiters. We spotted a hair in our spinach dip and our waiter Keith just looked at it said ""Oh"" and walked away, he did that a couple times, just ignoring our questions   The waiter was nice half the time and weird the other half of the time, felt like he had an evil twin or something. Yea I also agree with another review I read that the seared ahi salad looks NoTHING like the photo haha, although it was pretty tasty. I was happy I could substitute the wontons for crispy onion strings, much yummier. The grilled chicken sandwich with fries was delicious. The chicken alfredo ended up being a bit too oily.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula

My birthday had past a week ago and she was checking my ID to make sure that I was old enough to drink and as soon as she read the date she was so excited and was checking on us every 15 minutes to make sure that we were satisfied, needed more drinks and everything. When it came time for dessert, I didn't want anyone to sing to me so another lady brought out our dessert and Melissa came running after her with candles, let them and told me to make a wish and blow out the candles.

Usually the food is superb however today they got my order all wrong. I asked for the Root Beer ribs however received wings instead. The server was nice enough to bring out my ribs 10 mins later however these portion looked like rib tips and not ribs. The pizza was good as usual and so was my salad. Lately, the BJ food experience has not been up to par on our last few visits to their resturant.

They had outside seating with misters which was great. The server was really nice and attentive. The food was just ahhh...  We had Brussels sprouts as an app and they were good but needed more balsamic and bacon. I ordered the special which was shrimp skillet with jalapeno corn and was not impressed it had 4 little pieces of shrimp in a tiny skillet with some corn that was smothered in sauce. My friend had a burger that was pretty bland. The beer was cold so that was good. Overall the food needs to improve.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula
Stephanie B.,"Murrieta, CA",28,132,24,1.0,11/3/2017,"Definitely won't be returning. The service was beyond disappointing. Our waitress couldn't be bothered to refill our drinks and or even see if we were satisfied with our food. We barely touched most of our food and you would think that would be a good time to ask if it was ok, but no. The food runners kept dumping all of our hot plates in front of our small children. The best part was sitting next to not one but three filthy tables for a majority of our meal.

Yes I'm a little dramatic but basically I haven't been disappointed. Oh and the service? Yes, love it. They're always so nice and friendly and so helpful! On my birthday our waiter remembered to bring shots out exactly at midnight even though we forgot. I was impressed since it was a busy night. The couscous mac n cheese is a must!

Ariel R.,"Temecula, CA",321,136,77,3.0,11/15/2016,"I'm BAAAAAaaack... for the Pizzookie only. For a Monday night, it was pretty busy. Every time I've came here for dinner, there was never an issue with us getting seated right away. It was my Son's Birthday and right after Day-Care, my Husband and I took him to get a Pizzookie since he's a cookie and ice cream fanatic (Gets it from his mom) . Our server was nice and attentive. We didn't really ask for much during our dessert, but when I did, he was quick.  Birthday Boy got his own little personal Pizzookie while I was daring and ordered the Trio Pizzookie, giving you the options to choose three of their cookie flavors all topped with their vanilla ice cream. My husband decided on the Chocolate Chunk, Cookies n' Creme and Salted Caramel. Everything took about 10 minutes to come out. Birthday boy even got a Candle on top of his Pizzookie. Everything was warm and extremely fresh. Warm and delicious! YUM! My favorite will always be the chocolate chunk which is just a chocolate chip cookie. I always for some reason order the Oreo Cookie and I'm always indifferent about it. They have this Cookie and cream paste that they squirt on the side of the dish... which is an odd texture. The salted caramel was meh... nothing special to me, but I'm not that much of a fan for caramel. Total bill came up to $14.05. In total I paid $16.00 including tip. Literally just for dessert.

They took forever to Acknowledge my party, we waited forever to order our food.

Buster D.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/23/2017,"O.K. , after two years of being away from B.J.'s because of poor food quality and being served cold , we came back during the Christmas holiday . Gift cards were given to my wife at work , so we thought we'd try B.J.'s again , hopefully this time things have changed , but NOOOOO !! The food quality has changed  , but for the worse . Not getting into the whole meal my wife and kids had ordered (which by the way was mediocre) , I'll just concentrate on my order . I ordered a bison cheeseburger w/bacon , fries and a drink. Simple right ?? When they sat down our order and I looked down at my plate , I grabbed a fry , which many restaurants are notoriously served cold , of course they were sitting in the pan in the back cold . I asked the server right away to bring me some fresh fries , no problem . I then looked back down at my burger at the bacon, looked like it was just shaved off the pig , RAW !! Not only RAW , but ice cold , like they just took it out of the refrigerator .I picked it up and it was refrigerator cold , they didn't even attempt to heat it up . I grabbed the bacon out of disgust went to find the manager . After some time he came out the back from the kitchen and I relayed my story to him , he gave me some minor pushback , and I told him ""Touch the bacon , it's raw and cold"" , how do you as a restaurant dare serve food like this , long story short he took care of the food bill , because he knew what they served us was disgusting . Trichinosis is a big deal eating out and I know if I ate that food/bacon there was a high probability I would've gotten sick . B.J.'s is a disgusting restaurant for food , unqualified cooks that serve poor quality food . I gave the gift cards to the table next to us , they were grateful . I will never return to this establishment . I'm not sure if all the B.J.'s are this poor quality , but this one needs to have top level management go in and do an overhaul of the complete restaurant .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=20

Apryl H.,"Palm Springs, CA",274,96,824,1.0,1/20/2016,"Woohoo! Happy 28th birthday to my sister. I drove 7 hours to be with her, and a group of us went to the restaurant that her and her man (who turned 32 yesterday) picked. They really wanted some good stiff drinks and deep dish pizza. So, we waited 25 min., to get a table at BJ's. Didn't mind the wait at all, because it is a popular restaurant, especially for a small town on a Saturday night. Score! We got to sit in the bar! It's the little things when you finally get a night out together without children. We were ready to party it up! 2 birthdays, and I was celebrating scoring a great new job. The waitress instantly greats us, and I was thinking ""wow! What service."" We all asked to start with water, and I was SO excited about my sisters birthday that I blurted out the fact that she needs a recommendation for a great celebratory drink, and my sister included the request for a mixed drink without any vodka. She recommended a few and my sister and her man decided to go with the first two options. I thought they sounded horrible, so I asked for a bottle of Lindemans Framboise, with 2 glasses so I could share it with her. She asked for ID's, and took a while staring at my sisters man. She asked for my sisters ID, and cringed since it expired today. OK, then she looked at her mans ID, and happily exclaimed, ""happy birthday"" before refusing his drink because he didn't have DMV paperwork proving that he renewed it. Instead of feeling bad about ruining his (all of our) celebration, she pressured him to order a non-alcoholic drink. Blushing and pissed off, he shrugged and said, ""ah, maybe a Sprite?"" Of everyone in the group, GUESS who's ID she didn't even care to check?! I guess I look too old to get carded... I went against my feisty instincts to walk out before ordering, so we choked down mediocre chips & queso, pizza, some weird black & tan but with cider on the bottom, and the most enjoyable part of the night was the pre-bottled Framboise, not tipping, and the double Pizookie they threw in because they knew we were pissed.

And the server looked at my partner differently. All I can say I felt discriminated and felt like I was in a racist environment. Why because I'm light skin and he is brown skin heads up even though I look white I'm 100% Mexican. I felt discriminated even though all the dirty looks where towards my partner.

Alicia H.,"Murrieta, CA",117,22,2,2.0,3/16/2017,"I ordered via GrubHub and ordered the rib-eye with brussel sprouts and white cheddar mashed potatoes.  I also ordered the potato skins.  My order was correct and made it on time...it was still hot.  However, the rib eye was dry and bland and tasted as if there were no seasoning on it at all.  (A hard feat with a cut of meat that is so marbleized it comes with it's own flavor.) The mashed potatoes were salty, could've used that on the steak, and a bit dry.  And the brussel sprouts were slightly sweet, which I REALLY didn't like.  The potato skins were OK but the toppings were scarce.   This was my first time trying BJ's and looking at all the reviews, their quality/service is hit or miss.  Probably won't patronize their business again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=40

Never had any major problem and they make one of the best pizzas I've eaten at a chain restaurant. Overall I really like the food here, no matter what city I'm in. We had dinner here on or around 7/19 and I really enjoyed it. Saw a guy picking up three huge bags of take out food as we headed to the front doors.  My wife had a hard time making a selection from the large menu but did end up ordering the Caprese Piadina with fresh mozzarella, basil, tomatoes, in a toasted bread wrap with marinara sauce for dipping. It came with crispy shoestring fries which are her favorite, so it was a hit. I had the Bison Burger which comes with coleslaw, although not the traditional kind. The burger was cooked medium rare the way I ordered it (thank you!) and the slaw was like chopped cabbage with a dressing lightly drizzled on top, not mixed in or soggy the way some coleslaw can be. In fact, it was under dressed, a bit dry and the cabbage looked a bit dry and grey around the edges. Tasted okay but obviously had been prepped hours before. So I'm still a fan and have eaten here at least 6 times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=40

For my dessert I ordered the BJ's Baked Beignet, with the request of the strawberries, strawberry sauce, whipped cream and ice cream be served on the side instead of on top of the beignet.  I try to enjoy my dessert slowly so I didn't want a soggy beignet.  This dessert was very delicious, simple and light.  I would definitely order that dessert again.  I would have the Quinoa Chicken bowl too, but my hope is to try something new each time I return to a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=40

It's pretty thick applewood smoked bacon. She said the fries could have been crisper and seasoned better.

The noodles were hard and stuck together. He said the chicken taste awful. I'm not one to complain so I didn't say anything. The waiter was very nice.

He looked like he was serving too many tables than he can handle, and was showing attention to what seemed to be like every table but ours. Then, we ordered our favorite sliders with cheese, and we received them with no cheese. We nicely asked for them to be redone with cheese, and we got them back with cold slices of cheese added to the now cold original sliders. Pretty frustrated at this point, we asked to speak to the manager and I explained to her our situation. She kindly returned with the sliders fresh and exactly how we wanted them. The rest of our entree's were also very good. But the manager and our server seemed to be uninterested in the troubles we were experiencing. Our food was delicious, but we spent a 2 hour trip that was expected to be a quick dinner at BJ's, excitingly with a promotional free pizookie. Even after our complaints, we had to flag down our server for the check.  Overall, our food was very delicious and we were very pleased with our meals. But the service was extremely poor from start to finish. Even after bringing our problems to a managers attention, we lacked the experience we usually never fail to get at a BJ's restaurant.

The waiter addressed the cold food issue to the manager and she was nice enough to come, apologize and give us a discount on the whole check. No complaints from their customer service. Next day however when my son went to open up the pizza box and eat a piece, we were all in shock to see that the slices had SHRUNK to almost HALF the size of the original piece!!!

Drive the extra few minutes to go to the Bj's in Menifee it's worth the extra time!!  Do not order take out or curbside at this location, they are either sneaky and out to overcharge you, or they cant adequately train their staff in how to perform the rather simple task of taking your order. I ordered a Santa Fe Chicken Salad, and the lady behind the counter at the take out ended up ringing me up and subsequently charging me for the salad (which comes with chicken), and a side chicken breast totaling 17 dollars and change. How in the world this employee couldn't comprehend that the amount she was going to ring in for 1 salad was astronomically too high is beyond me. But if that was all that happened I could look past one horrid employee, and wouldn't have to write this review. But upon receiving my receipt and seeing what the take out counter had done with my order (they could have at least given me extra chicken but the cooks obviously felt like skimping out that day it was the smallest amount of chicken I'd ever seen on that salad.) I called to talk to a manager to inform him of what had happened so she could be properly trained and they wouldn't have this happen again. I was not looking for anything in return, but the call  progressively got worse. Take out counter was very rude, tried to not let me speak to a manager, then the manager tried to tell me I was wrong, then admitted they were in the wrong, never actually apologized, but asked for our address to send a gift card to encourage giving them another try. (didn't offer fixing the charge, or even a discount, or a refund, I ended up paying the full 17 dollars for that salad.) *Best part 4 months later... we're still waiting on that gift card that is never coming..

Helen B.,"Temecula, CA",20,46,11,1.0,11/18/2015,"This review is for the Temecula location, on Ynez Road.  Strike One: The hostess sat my husband and I near a family of four with two small children under five. The screaming and yelling that emanated from their table was enough to distract me from my meal the entire time I was there. Why would we be seated in what is obviously a section for families? I was very unhappy, and would have asked to move but for the rest of our experience making me want to leave the whole place as soon as I possibly could.  Strike Two: Our waitress was just plain strange. She would stand at our table after each interaction, like she was waiting for us to say something when we were clearly done with talking. Now, this can't really be helped, other than by not hiring odd people. But it DID make our dining experience a little uncomfortable.  Strike Three: We ordered the soup and salad combo, with the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl as the soup for each of us. The bread bowls were toasted beyond what is edible. We were JUST at the BJ's in Menifee, where they served a MUCH better version of this meal. The soup inside the bowls was slightly different as well, much thinner in texture with fewer clams. But the real sin was how blackened the bowls were! Normally, my husband would snack on the bowl once the chowder was eaten, and he pushed his plate away as soon as he possibly could.  I have not had any good experiences at this restaurant. I would not recommend it to someone visiting Temecula, because I don't feel that it is in any way a fair representation of the good food one can find in this area.

That's how much we love this restaurant. I've been here plenty of times and I have no complaint with anything what so ever! The ambiance is romantic and elegant, but you can come casual or dressy, which ever you prefer. I usually come for lunch or dinner and I never had to wait for a table. The service is always great! They're very friendly and patient with you, which I appreciate because I can be very indecisive, and they always check up on how we're doing often. The food comes very fast and fresh. I never get tired of the food here! I normally order the BBQ Chicken Salad or a pizza to share and they never disappoint! They also came out with new appetizers recently which I'm dying to try! I've tried the pepperoni dip and it's alright, not the best appetizer, but it was worth trying. And of course, we always have an Oreo Pazooki which is our favorite.

When I arrived I had to wait a long time just to tell them that I'm picking up my order. The girl on the counter gave me unreasonable attitude and tossed the food on the counter and walked away. I was upset and left the restaurant. After a couple hours I tried calling to speak to a manager but I couldn't get anyone to answer the phone. Like as said, good food but terrible customer service.

Jasmine O.,"Winchester, CA",43,17,6,1.0,2/22/2016,"I have been going to this location for quite some time. Normally it's not bad enough to comment but this time it's being noted. I took my 19 year old daughter here this past Thursday night to celebrate her bday. We had a party of 15 attending and I made sure all on one order to make it easier for the waiter. They weren't that busy, and it seemed we were going to be tended to. First delay was kids menus. Our waiter was getting us drinks and couldn't get anyone to help him. The hostess sat us down with not enough menus (her fault) yet he brought the drinks and then went missing. Finally when he came around we reasked for kids menus. Ordering went fine. Then came a manager trainee named Cody to let a waitress out of the emergency exit. The exit was right next to our table. She said can't I just go out this door? He gave in and let her out just so she could bring a friend thru the door. The problem was the alarm went off and kept ringing, right next to our table. Alarms happen and we are pretty understanding but this was left on while the staff was joking and playing around including Cody. Cody went to get the key and came to lock the door then says ""sorry bout that"". Doesn't even make eye contact and walks away. I was pretty angry by now. I felt I chose to spend a lot of money here and there are a bunch of restaurants in this area. Hmm I made the wrong choice. Well the food came and we had to ask our waiter twice for a child's spoon. Having a 3 year old stare at others while they eat doesn't work in any family. Period! The next doozer was using the restroom. What the hell???!! I have attached pictures. This restaurant needs Kandis the old manager to be back. She ran that place like a champ!! The bathroom counters were disgusting. This place has lost so much and will continue of their staff doesn't get a clue. I'm Disappointed for spending a fortune at a place that treated us as if we were buying fast food. I don't know if anyone could get me to go back to that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=120

Christina M.,"Cardiff, CA",679,286,170,2.0,9/21/2014,"Not the best experience I've ever had at a BJ's... Although we were given a pager and told it would be a 20 min wait, myself and the group I was with were pleasantly surprised when we were seated 2 minutes later. Our waitress Megan was nice but very forgetful and incredibly slow with service. Our drinks took awhile to come out, so slow in fact I debated canceling my drink order since I prefer to enjoy my drink before my appetizer (which is why we ordered them before we ordered our appetizers). Nobody really cared for their food excepts for my daughter even though her fries were cold(not warm, literally cold) it was like they left them on the plate for awhile and then set hot chicken strips hoping they would warm them up. My pizza barely had any cheese and their were some spots where the vegetables on my pizza were only touching bread. Super bummed since I've had BJs pizza before and was expecting it to be just as good. Two of the people in my group didn't eat close to 1/2 of their food because it was either cold or sloppily prepared and Megan never bothered to check on us to see how our food was so they made do.  We decided to get dessert since no one was really full haha..The pizookies were delicious as always!! So that's where that second star comes in..the way to my heart is through dessert:) Bottom line, we all had fun because we were together but we wished we had chosen a different place for dinner since it was money wasted.

Bryan R.,"Temecula, CA",0,1,,2.0,6/10/2016,"So i am a huge fan of this restaurant. I enjoy their food and the people are always friendly. Me and the wife decided to go enjoy some lunch there today and i was super excited to have a burger i saw on the online menu. When we got there there was no wait at all. We were seated before we even said hi....exagerration of course....as we sat there and looked at the menu, we literally decided our drinks, appetizer, and main meal...all while still not being greated by a waiter/waitress. After deciding our whole three course meal i started wondering why we havent even been greated and still to this point havent so much ordered drinks.  After 8 minutes i noticed that a table next to us had the waitress ask them for deserts, leave, bring them boxes, leave, and then bring them a check and drop off drinks at a different table and then once again leave...all while me and my wife sat there paitently to order our drinks. After 12 minutes we decided to leave because i couldnt imagine the wait to get a box or get our check or get a refill or any of that. I understand waiter/waitresses are nice and friendly but you also have a job to do. Im highly dissapointed. And what makes it worse is that they were not busy by any means as there was tables open all around us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=140
Caitlin Y.,"Long Beach, CA",63,90,165,1.0,8/22/2015,"Haven't been to BJ's in a hot minute and decided to stop in for lunch with my sister. We got in and were greeted. I notified the hostess it would just be for two. She then began a 2minute discussion with two other employees on where to sit us, claiming certain waiters/waitresses were too busy to have an additional table. They sat us in Robin's section and 5minutes passed before Robin came to greet us. We ordered our food and my sister asked for  a side of ranch with her meal. When our starter salads arrived, the Caesar didn't have enough dressing on it and my sister wanted to request a side. Well, Robin was nowhere to be found for quite a while. Finally my sister was able to flag her down and order that side of dressing. When our main dishes came, there wasn't any ranch delivered, so we had to request some from the girl who delivered our food to us. When we were almost done with our meal, Robin checked back in and asked if we wanted to get a pizookie. I told her we'd have to think about it. After finishing our meals we decided to get the pizookie trio. While waiting for our trio to arrive, Robin hands us the check and tells us to pay whenever we're ready. We had put cash in the check book but kept the book with us because we didn't want the already lacking service to dwindle because she already got paid out. Well, while we are enjoying our dessert, Robin approaches us and notifies us that she's leaving now since her shift is ending and rudely requests we give her the checkbook. Excuse me? I understand it can be a huge pain waiting tables, but I've never ONCE had someone come up and do that. I've had them introduce us to the next person who will be helping us, but never have I had someone rudely request us to handover the book so they can get paid out. So Robin leaves us, the new girl doesn't introduce herself. But as we are finishing up, she asks if she can have the checkbook. I tell her we already paid out. She then asks me if we are had a tip left or not. To get her to leave the situation alone I commented that there wasn't a tip. I then see her walk away and she goes up to Robin and I can see them exchanging words. I completely understand every waiter/waitress wants their tips and it's a huge part of their paycheck. But please don't pressure me into paying you, it makes the situation extremely uncomfortable. I really don't need you or your replacement breathing down my neck for your tip. I work hard for my paycheck and I'm not going to leave you a great tip for below par service paired with an awkward tip hungry departure. Sorry, not sorry.

Anyways, Leila was very attentive and was always checking up on how we were doing and/or we needed a refill.

Incredibly helpful with menu selections, more than accommodating when we didn't know what we wanted to drink...no hint of annoyance at all. Hell, I was annoyed with us not being able to choose. Maybe people in Temecula are just happier? who knows...all that matters is we were very happy w/ the service we got, and if we get another gift card in the future, you better believe we won't use it at any other location but this one.

First of all WTF who do u think you are saying it's not his b-day you never been our waitress we don't even know you!, but anyways she leaves and we get the b-day thing  for my dad.. But her and the other girl workers, one with red and some other ones were no lie standing by their computer staring at us! So not obvious.Then were just sitting and waiting for jade to come and give our check but she wouldn't even come! She would go to other tables help them wouldn't even look our way. Then would go into the kitchen. After 15 mins later we ask another girl to get our check, and she said she'll call jade to get it, who took her sweet @ss time, we finally got. But in the end she ruined our night and it was terrible service and I'm not coming back because of JADE and other girls.

Sydney H.,"Wildomar, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/8/2017,"Went here for my graduation dinner. I was very excited to eat here with my family because I loved this place. My family and I were greeted by two of the RUDEST hostesses in the world. I was Astonished that they thought their behavior was okay. They told us a party of ten would be a 2 hour wait. So we called ahead for a party of six and a party of four. No problems there, except when we actually got there. We simply asked ""how long is the wait for a party of ten now?"" They told us two hours. We said ""alright well how long for the reservation for six we called in?"" The hostesses immediately got snarky, ""well six or ten?"" She said in an annoyed tone. ""Six"" replied my father. She told us the wait for six would be 30 to 40 minutes. ""Okay great, so can we seated next to the party of four that we also called in. We don't need to be at the same table but can we be seated at a table next to theirs?"". The hostesses got angry and said no. Well I don't see what the big deal is! How hard is it to have people sit at tables next to each other!? The other hostess then told us she WON'T sit us next to each other. She had a horrible tone in her voice as she refused to sit is next to each other. All she had to do was explain in a calm tone that she couldn't do this, instead she raised her voice and rollers her eyes at us. We were appalled by the rudeness of these two blonde hostesses. The first hostess then turned her face and laughed at us. That's right she laughed at us. Not like a giggle, a full on series of laughs. What a rude rude lady. We will never ever be returning to the temecula Bj's on Ynez road. We will also be calling the big boss and letting him know that these hostesses think laughing at their customers and yelling at them is okay. We will never ever be returning here. My entire family was disgusted with your horrible service! I will post this review everywhere that I can. I want people to know that this restaurant hires rude hostesses that apparently don't know how to do there job. Thank goodness for Macaroni grill. They were so so polite and gave us such amazing service. When they heard how Bj's treated us they were appalled and made sure to treat us way better than Bj's had ever treated us. I hope those two hostesses at Bj's get set straight because it is never okay to laugh at your customers in their face and yell at them. NOT OKAY.

Several minutes later they brought two entrees and our wings, and it continued that way until everything was brought out. But the last thing that was brought out was my mom's steak. It looked like a rock on a big plate. Even though it was delicious, the presentation was HORRIBLE.

First off, it was a Sunday, when we first arrived the place was pretty empty. Our server came over after we had been sitting a while and took our drink order. Then she brought my beer out, then she brought out my boyfriends iced tea then she vanished. After quite some time, (long enough that boyfriend needed a refil and still didn't get one) she finaly came back to take our order.  I ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps, he ordred a meaty small pizza. After about 25 minutes our food came out. His pizza was cold, I mean like cheese wouldn't even stretch cold. He is pissed and thirsty, I am pretty content on  my meal itself, but it is a chilled meal so I have no idea if my meal would have been cold too had it been a ""hot"" meal. We asked for our check a couple times and a box. Finally our check came, but no box. If you are going to be a decent restauranrt, have decent service.

Phillip told the manager in the kitchen my pizza was cold.  The manager brought me out a mini buffalo chicken pizza and they wrapped my small to go!!!  Who does that anymore?  Isn't the service provided by BJs what we all long for?  Thank you BJs.  Telling everybody I know why BJs has such an awesome reputation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=200

It was my sister's birthday so we had to go.  Soda was flat and I asked for another but that was flat too so I gave up. LOL  I liked where we were as it wasn't too loud but there was a game on and it was nice to watch it for a bit even though I'm one of those who wants to hear everything but being in a restaurant, that's not possible.  I had the portobello burger which I thought was good and I liked the waitress we had. We had to wait for someone who was coming but he had called his gf to give the order and we finally ordered.

We sat staring at our food for sometime waiting for utensils. We were a party of six and one of the main entrees was not brought out.  Service had already been so bad, we decided to not say anything to see if the MIA entree would appear on the bill.  Sure enough it was on the bill!!!!!  The server had no clue it never came out and was shocked when we asked for the item to be removed from the bill.  Thankfully, our friend was not that hungry and was fine with the side salad.  Not impressed with the new menu.  How can you remove a cobb salad from a menu?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=220

Brenda B.,"Temecula, CA",24,23,3,4.0,7/23/2012,"My man loves this place. ""It's been too long since I've had BJs!"" he likes to fancy saying.  That said, we've been here a few times. I can't say I really recall the times prior to this last one over the weekend-- it always struck me as just another one of your chain sports bars but with a slightly more put together appeal. Their menu is giant. This could be a bad thing because you get so lost in it, and I much prefer my restaurants to stick to a smaller menu of amazing dishes than a large one of just so-so. So far, though, I've not gotten anything I didn't like. Counting my calories at 1,500 a day for the last few weeks is not my idea of fun, but my jeans are thanking me. Going out to eat is another matter, with delicious tempting entrees that are easily over 1,000 calories alone. BJs, though, has an Enlightened menu, so I decided to give that a try. I ordered the a pint of Lightswitch Light Lager, 135 calories. I love my beer, especially my high, high calorie hoppy beer, so I didn't expect much here. It was light, cold and fresh-- perfect for a Saturday afternoon. I also ordered the Enlightened chicken tacos with black beans for lunch-- 511 calories. It was very good. Three cute little tacos with chicken, cabbage and carrots and a bowl of black beans with a few measly corn chips stuck into it. Doesn't sound too good, does it? But it was very delicious and filling. The flavors were spot on. Saturday afternoon was incredibly busy, but we were seated promptly. The waitress was pretty decent, too.

We waited approximately 20 mins before the food was served to us. However, all but one person did not have food served in front of him. The server came out, apologized and said she made a mistake. She put in the order but my friend had to wait for another 20 mins for his fried meat and veggies. While he waited I offered him some of my food because I knew he was hungry. Finally his food arrived. When we got the bill, I expected that he would get a discount on his food since he waited for so long. Unfortunately, he did not. This is unacceptable. I've seen other restaurants give a small discount when they know the server was at fault.

I ordered a cheeseburger and it took thirty plus minutes to arrive, then pile onto that the fact that it had no cheese, in fact there was nothing on it but lettuce... Da fuk?? It was disgusting. I had three bites and pushed it aside, I was tired, still hungry, and at this point I just wanted to get the check and leave. But getting the check would require having a waiter who was around. Waiting just fuelled my hate fire for this particular BJ's, but I decided to just let it go and pay for my food that I absolutely hated so we could just leave. I give them my card to pay for my ""cheeseburger"" and when he brings the check back I notice $45.00 was charged to my card. At this point I was now tired, hungry, angry and broke.

We've been to the BJ's in Carlsbad a number of times and have never had a problem with our order.  However nothing in our order came out correctly.  Due to a food allergy that my husband has we were very clear about our questions about food preparation and ingredients.  Still, when we got both our appetizers and food there were ingredients that we asked to have kept off of our plates.  When we asked to have our order made over the waiter made it sound as though we had done something to the food ourselves to make it unacceptable.  My husband was able to have order something different however when they brought out his new plate (a pasta bowl) there was some kind of spicy seasoning in it that he reacted to.  The waiter came by to check on us after giving him his new plate and although we mentioned that my husband wasn't able to eat it due to the spicy seasoning, the waiter didn't offer to change it or take it off the bill and just take the plate back to the kitchen.  Typically we love the dessert at BJ's but due to our experience that night, we didn't want to even try that!  BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in general is a good restaurant, but this particular location leaves much to be desired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=240

CLAM CHOWDER - COLD, TWO PIZZAS - COLD, FRENCH FRYS - COLD !!!WT??? We told Jenn and she took care of it...The frys came out piping hot and the pizza was hot as well... The manager came over and made a few EXCUSES for the restaurant and took the clam choder off the bill... But this restaurant has very poor standards for quality food obviously...AND I DONT ESPECIALLY SINCE IM FROM CHICAGO...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=260

I came and she was able to give me the best and most delicious dishes in each section of the menu. I ordered the champagne shrimp pasta and wasn't interested in the shrimp so I ordered the chicken. They happily changed it and it was delicious. My friend ordered the Cajun pasta with blackened chicken and this is really delicious too. I'm not too much into the spicy foods, but this is good.  Make sure when you come to save room for dessert!!!

The only problem was the food. We ordered some hot wings as an appetizer. They were brought to our table about 2 minutes before our main course came. Kind of defeats the purpose of ordering an appetizer. The wings were served plain and the hot sauce was on the side. Very strange. Never had hot wings served like that before.  We ordered a large deep dish pizza with pepperoni and onions. This was the worst pizza we've ever had. The entire pizza had only 6 pepperonis on it, a few pieces of onion, maybe a tablespoon of sauce and very little cheese. There were several slices that were 100% plain!!!!!  $24 for a pizza and all we get is crust??  The slices that did have something on it had zero flavor. The waitress was embarrassed when she saw our pizza. The manager came over immediately and was very nice. We gave back the pizza minus the two slices we ate.  He removed the pizza from our bill and offered us another free pizza and dessert. We declined the free pizza because it was horrible but accepted the free dessert which was very good.

If you dont like a long wait, have you thought of sitting at a table in the bar area? yes kids can sit there (see * below) and there is no waiting. :) A quick shout out to Kelsey our server in the BAR area on Sunday- Kelsey you were awesome friendly, attentive, informative and my little one thought you were very very nice to suggest she could have her own pizzooki on account she graduated 5th grade with such good grades... We agree-- and all know- okay I didnt want to share.. I am entitled once in a while.. yeesh!!!  J/K- no really.. First lets talk brew because you can have ice water and tea anywhere but the brew factor menu here is dyno-mite. had to say it. Just trying to choose is boggling, so this time I had the Berry Burst Cider AMAZING okay I have to say I am a  Framboise gal  (bev mo $5.00) but this berry business has me rethinking my love of a hearty lager.  Moving forward on the food business. I always have a salad kinda cons my brain into healthy mode- this time I had the bleu cheese wedge salad- bacon-y goodness and perfect crunchy lettuce plenty of tomatos M MM MMM  Main dish was the pot roast. Now, normally I have a pasta dish or a personal pizza-- but a pot roast went by to another table-- and I luvs me a good pot roast, hearty hunks of tender meat, salty yet not too salty--peppery thick mushroom gravy hearty and just stick to your ribs fluffy potatoes, carrots were not mushy, just tender and a still a tad crunchy-HOLY SMOKES I am jonesing for pot roast-- goodness...  man-o-man had they offered me a order of sourdough bread I would have licked that plate clean- go ahead laugh-- you would too! On to the real reason why I am here-- one word-- PIZZOOOOOOOKI      doesnt matter how you order it or how much you eat you HAVE to HAVE a Pizzoooki. Seriously I could make this at home any old time and I have, but something about that scoop of ice creme on a not quite all the way cooked, crunchy edge choco-chippy cookie in a pie pan is the bombdiggity! and makes me a happy Redhead and that makes my man happy to see me enjoy a dang cookie -ahh the simple things in life.  OKAY now go to BJ's *******   Parents --- If you have kids who can't behave DON'T sit in the bar area..... wait for a booth where you can coral them in.  We dont want to trip over them as we leave, head to our table or trip over the little darling, as we head to the restroom- Screaming is not an option, pick a non naptime to eat out, if the rest of us who have /had kids can do it- so can you.  Because once again--if our server drops our order in order to not punt your kid across the floor because they were running the 40 yard dash giggling and being cute trying to get away from you....-- - oh yes you the parent will pay for my tossed meal if your kid is a banshee. And I am  NOT the only person that is a parent out there that feels this way.

We did complain to the floor manager that we had been waiting for around 30 or 40 minutes for our meal and that others that had come in before us had already been served.  He was very concerned and did go and check for our ticket and our food immediately came out.  He came to our table and said that the kitchen was a little backed us and that I was in fact wrong about my estimated wait time.  It was really 29 minutes of waiting.  Still pretty long for two small lunches, in my opinion.

The pasta was like a spaghetti. I asked if I could have alfredo sauce, she said it was a spicy type sauce... so for the sake of the people I was sitting with, I just said okay... but... it was spaghetti.

I love Bj's Cajun Pasta with shrimp. I still order it every time despite the inconsistency of it. It's always hit or miss at the Menifee's BJ's. One time it could be amazing- flavorful and cooked right, next time it could be bland and pasta can be either over or under cooked.  We have been to the Menifee's BJ's since opening day and I wish their consistency in food and service could be better. The wait time for food is increasing. To the point that if my pasta came out yucky, I (normally would) wouldn't send it back because it would be another 30 minutes of wait time.  Yesterday we went there again and our server went on break so she brought another waitress over to take care of us. The sub waitress must be really busy because she would rush to our table, ask how everything is, and before we could say anything, she would head to the next table, or her eyes would glance around other tables.

We almost left because it was taking forever for the food to come out.  Then my drink refill was not even what I had been drinking.  There is a huge difference in Peach and Raspberry tea. I will never return to that establishment.  I always get a military discount when I take my kids to the restaurant in Escondido.  The server said she didn't think they offered it but would ask.  Then the young manager came out and told me it was for active duty only.  I was STUNNED.  So if my spouse was deployed and I went in there with my kids we were not good enough for a measly 10% discount but we were good enough to have our patriarch put his life on the line for this measly establishment.  I told this manager that I am given this discount when I am with my kids in Escondido and he said to me. ""You do?""  I said ""No I am lying!""  He tried to back peddle at that point and say that isn't what he meant.  Too late the damage was done.  I couldn't believe I was treated that way and especially in front of my girlfriend or that other tables could hear what was going on. I was so embarrassed and felt so belittled.

If you've ever been to the BJ's in UTC or Maui you'll know what I'm talking about with the size of this place.  The food is like the Cheesecake Factory in many ways. A very diverse menu with obese sized portions. The food is predictable as far as taste, and in line with many other places like this, though it's cheaper than Yard House and Stone Brewery. I ordered the BBQ salad which was a pile of chopped salad drowning in dressing. It did have a lot of chopped chicken and it tasted good. There was just too much of it, and because it was soggy I couldn't take it home. The Crusted Chicken with mashed potatoes was large ( had the rest for lunch today) and was decent. Kids meals are serviceable, but the smiley faced potato discs had an odd texture. Oh well, my son didn't seem to mind. They really dim the light here for dinner, not sure why.

Would of been nice to have our tables placed in a less crowded area(we were smack dab in the center) but was fine with the set up.  Everyone had a good time and food, as always, was delish!  A few of us, including me, got a bit stupid off the microbrews.  But it's all good in da hood! Anyway, I like it here and often come back.  Definitely one of the good bars/restaurants in the Temecula area. My wife likes BJ's too!...............Get you mind out of the gutter, foo!  Already told ya I'm talkin' about the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=300

Basil M.,"Murrieta, CA",140,473,205,1.0,6/25/2013,"I never write reviews for chains - but I felt compelled to. I have to preface this with - we like the food. We get take out here often.  But when we have eaten at the restaurant - we have always had a bad experience.   I don't know why I even bothered going back again today. We ordered our appetizers and the kids food first. The apps and kids food came out 25 Minutes later. The kids fries were cold and soggy - but they were starving and they ate it anyway. Our calamari was cold too. We sent it back and it took them 20 minutes to replace it. All we ordered for food was a soup and salad, and 1 entree. It took 45 minutes for our food to come out after they replaced our calamari. Today - on a Sunday at 3pm, when the restaurant was 70% empty.  Busy or slow - it's always the same.  The service is bad - it always is bad. In all the years it has been here it has never improved.  This is not a staff problem - This is a management problem. They clearly do not train the staff. Or they under staff to keep the bottom line low.  Either way - if you come here, expect mediocre service and long wait times.  If you like the food - stick to take out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=300

The food was definitely a little better than your average chain, but nothing to write home about.  I got the Ahi Tuna Salad. The salad was actually pretty good except it came un-tossed, which I guess this is pretty standard for seared tuna salads. Except there was a dollop of wasabi at every corner of the salad . First I tried grabbing the different parts of the salad for each bite but that was kind of obnoxious. Then I tried to toss it so I could eat it like a normal salad, but this caused large chunks of wasabi to be hidden within the salad. Therefore, every few bites I'd get one of the chunks and my nostrils would burn and flare up. Luckily that feeling only lasts a few seconds. Not sure the best way to resolve my issues, but the salad could have been great otherwise. Maybe try mixing the wasabi in with the dressing BJ?

Melissa C.,"West Chicago, IL",220,148,579,2.0,7/25/2013,"We were so excited to come to BJs this year. Coming from Chicago, we don't have a BJs in the area, and I remembered from our past visits to Southern California and Maui how much we loved their bruschetta and pizza. This past visit was super disappointing :( The service was extremely slow and the server kept forgetting things we'd ask for (parmesan cheese, silverware, etc). First we ordered our appetizers and ordered the famous bruschetta among other things for the table. We ordered a large, but the server had put in the mini order for us! When we let him know the mistake, he said to keep the mini order for his mistake and that the large order would be out shortly. It did take quite a while to get the order out, but ended up coming out fine. However, at the end of the meal, we noticed (after we paid of course!) that we were charged for BOTH the mini and the large order of bruschetta!  After our appetizers, we waiting QUITE a while for our meal. Our server kept coming up to our table saying that the food would be out any second, yet I never saw him go back to the kitchen to check it :/ When we received our order, my husband and my cousin's husband shared a large pepperoni and sausage pizza. Again, being from Chicago, I've had a ton different types of pizza. When we recieved the pizza it was lukewarm at best and had a doughy texture....like it wasn't cooked long enough, but than sat under the warming lamps for longer than it should have. Overall, our trip to BJs was anticlimactic at best. In the future, we'd probably order some bruschetta to go and leave it at that....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=300

First we ordered drinks, we waited about 10 minutes for those. When he came back he forgot my dads beer and he brought me a raspberry sparkling lemonade thing when I ordered an orange twist... When I told him it was the wrong one he told me I was wrong and that it was definitely an orange twist. It wasn't because it was clear with red stuff on the bottom. I asked him to bring me another one, and he brought back the right one. Dad still didn't have his beer. When he bright me a refill he brought me back some red cranberry grapefruit thing? I honestly didn't feel like waiting for another 10 minutes just to have him fix my drink again. Finally brought dad his beer. When the food came out they got all the sides wrong so we had to wait again for those. My boyfriend and I are regulars here but maybe we'll find somewhere else. Pazookie was great.

Our server Robin was terrific. She stopped by soon after we sat down and had a very friendly demeanor. She checked back just enough times to see how everything was. If every server were like her, I would be a happy camper. The Bazaar wait staff should learn from this woman. One of our appetizers was late because the kitchen goofed on the ingredients and they had to make it again. Robin came over immediately to let us know and apologized profusely. The manager even stopped by to apologize. They didn't leave us out to dry wondering where our orders was. We also received complementary pizookies because we were celebrating a few birthdays.  The restaurant was very busy at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday and the wait only got longer. Luckily we only waited 20 minutes for a large booth in the back dining area.

Laura B.,"Murrieta, CA",12,38,,3.0,9/4/2011,"I came to BJ's last night with my husband. I'm a vegetarian and finding a place that we can both eat at is often very hard. So I was pleased to see that BJ's had an assortment of pizza's that were meat free, a pasta with veggies dish, and a bunch of salads. So many restaurants these days are content and making their vegetarian patrons eat bread and cheese, so it's nice to be able to see some actual veggies.  I ordered the mediteranean vegetable pasta and a mozzarella and tomato salad. I thought the salad was really good, although I'm not really a fan of straight up balls of cheese (I made my husband eat those).  When my vegetable pasta came out, I thought it looked really good. WRONG! It was horrible. I can't even explain it. It tasted good at first, but there was a really nasty after taste that reminded me of burning plastic. I was never able to pin-point the culprit. Perhaps it was the kalamata olives? Or the capers? Or just the weirdness of putting those together in a tomato sauce. Either way, it was gross. I tried to eat it, tried to ignore the after taste, but about 1/4 of the way through the salad I just couldn't do it and had to stop eating (and believe me, I'll usually force myself to eat even the most gross restaurant meals, but not this time) If we go back (which I imagine we will), I will be sure to NOT order that god aweful vegetable pasta. Oh, and service is just ok. One of the other waitresses took our drink order (beer and wine) and then forgot to tell our actual server so we waited 30 minutes for our drinks.

Marlon D.,"Menifee, CA",136,36,6,1.0,4/20/2014,"Well here is my take on this spot.   Food wise was great as always.  However the service was less than desirable.   Considerably less.  Now this may be because I came in with a fairly large group but that is no excuse for terrible service.   At anyrate, first mistake, guy took our drink orders and took our appetizer orders.  Drinks came out fine however the appetizer after about 20-30min I ordered never came out even though I watched him write it down just before he left.  I asked if my order was going to come out he then said ""no I forgot to put it in I'm sorry ill do it now.""   I told him that wouldn't be necessary as it would come out the same time as my meal as I had ordered a salad.  Mistake #2 Our drinks were consistenly late being refreshed even though 3 different servers passed us looked at our tanle saw the empty glasses smiled at us and continued on their merry way.  REALLY what happened to working as a team?  Mistake 3 After about 1hr and change our order came out.  This is after the server  came back to tell us about 20min after we ordered our main dishes that serveral orders from our group could not be fulfilled due to being out of those particular foods.  Wow... now comes the real disturbing part. Mistake 4 One of our party members could not consume a particular food and had made it abundantly clear at time of order.  When the order came out.... it was exactly opposite of what he ordered.  He made the complaint politely and reordered his pizza.  Mistake 5 After about 20-25mi  the order came out again the exact same way it came out originaly.... WRONG!!!!  At this point we are completely dissatisfied.   The attempt to make things right went almost unnoticed.  Now after being to both the Temecula one and menifee one and after hearing that the Temecula one service was so much better... I'll have to disagree.   This experience has been the worst I have had in ANY RESTAURANT.  I firmly believe that corporate should come down unannounced and investigate both sites for a period of one month to rectify these deficiencies.  Because this was absolutely horrible.  However the food, when we got it was great.  Not 1-2hr wait time great but good none the less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=340

Our party was approx. 85 people so it was hard to find a restaurant that could accommodate a party that large but BJ's was perfect!! They gave us the entire side room and it was the perfect size. They also let me set up a sweets display table at the party which was also great! I know some places don't let you bring in any outside food which can be a drag, especially for kids parties. I met with the events manager Brian Neal a few months before to go over the menu and guest # etc with him and he was very attentive and very accommodating, he even offered us way more buffet options for our event with no additional cost! It's nice to know that when I bring in a large event to a restaurant they will somewhat ""take care of me"" instead of nickel and diming me for every little thing. My guests were very happy with the food, service and set up of the party, as was my husband and I!! At the end of the party we were provided 3 HUGE PAZOOKIES for my guest wtih no extra charge!!! What a GREAT way to end a party!! My guest were so delighted and happily STUFFED with the great food and dessert!! During the event all the staff was very nice and attentive as well. I was running around the whole time, first setting up the décor and what not then busy mingling with my guest when they arrived. Really having barely anytime to sit down so it was so nice that a couple times the staff came up to me and asked me if I needed a drink or anything, which I thought was very attentive!

Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and fresh Roma tomatoes. The server was brand new to BJ's but obviously not new to serving.  She was on top of my drink and was pretty quick on all of our needs.   The restaurant is very loud and noisy when full as there is nothing really soft to mute the sounds of all the people echoing into the high ceiling room.  This is part of the ambiance that I think people like.  I liked it a lot. They have comfy booths as well as large tables for larger groups.  The price of the pizza was $17 and easily served 3 people.   I wish they had the nutritional information available but they didn't.   I asked at the restaurant and I went on-line, they just don't have it yet.  There are only like 30 restaurants right now so maybe as they grow.

Ken K.,"Hemet, CA",0,20,,2.0,10/30/2013,"Went to BJ's (the Temecula location) for the first time last weekend. First off, I thought the prices were inflated for the amount of food received! I realize they're a business and have to make a profit, but at least give the patron more value for their money than what I saw was the case. $3 for a lemonade? $10 for very, very small ""chicken wings"" (or what passes for ""chicken wings"")? $11 for their ""mini"" (should be ""super tiny"") pizza?  $15 for their ""small"" pizza? $10 for a smallish calzone? (And why do they refer to the calzone fillings as ""toppings""?) By the way, I almost feel they're guilty of false/misleading advertising because the supposedly ""deep dish"" pizzas we ordered were hardly akin to actual deep-dish style pizza. In my view, BJ's serves ""puffed-up"" cotton candy-like thick crusts to give the impression the pizza is so ""tall"" because (as with authentic deep dish pizza) it's chock-full of cheese, meat and sauce. When you bite into a slice of BJ's faux ""deep dish"" you mainly get a mouthful of airy crust with a skimpy amount of cheese, meat and sauce on top. Very disappointing ... but the photos of this mock ""deep dish"" pizza sure do look mouth watering on the menu! The kicker was when our waiter disappeared while we were waiting for a ""mini"" pizza which was ordered late, after the appetizers and main meal items had been ordered. He never gave any indication that he was leaving. We waited and waited and waited for this ""mini"" pizza to arrive and finally I asked another waiter if he could check on it. He informed me that our waiter was gone because he was doing some kind of transaction (maybe squaring up his tips with the cashier or similar.) It would have been nice if he took care of that sometime when doing so didn't interfere with the diners receiving food they'd ordered.  All in all, those who are easily pleased or who aren't too concerned with getting good value for their money or minimally adequate portions of food may like BJ's but for me, the best I can say is that I rate the BJ's location I dined at as ""fair"" at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=360

Aside from the cop out option of altering a salad, the manager helped guide me towards a vegetarian pizza (no cheese) or baked potato dressed how I like. I opted for the pizza...why spud it when I could do that easily at home? Without cheese, the deep dish crust was not oily or weighed down; it became more of a pizza pillow, gently cradling the healthy dollop of toppings. The flavours, serving size, preparation were all on point; my one complaint would be that I would have liked some more sauce -not only am I a tomatoe sauce fiend, but the stuff was good purdy durn good. I have also enjoyed a number of their drinks. The house brews are alright. Nothing special. Being a Porter girl meself, I was surprised to enjoy their Berry-something-or-other.

I've been to another BJ's previously and was mildly pleased with the food/service but it was nothing spectacular. This time was excellent though, everything from the service to the food to the value! Got there around 9pm on a Wednesday night, restaurant was about half full so we got a table right away. The hostess and server were both very pleasant and we felt comfortable immediately. I was recommended a beer -the same one I had actually already picked out- and the rest of our group had non-alcoholic beverages. Drinks arrived in a couple minutes, my beer was a ""Red"" that was hearty and flavorful. We ordered the Soup and Salad, BJ's Fav Pizza (medium), and I had the California burger. Debated on the size of the pizza as it would be split amongst a couple people, but after they server showed us the size on another table we decided medium would be fine. Food arrived in about 12 minutes, great timing for a variety of items. My burger was cooked perfectly medium the way I ordered -many places have their own ""version"" of cooking temperatures which are usually wrong. Medium should be slightly pink in the middle, and that's the way it was cooked. The burger itself was fantastic, one of the best I've had all year. Came with chipotle mayo on the side and wedge-cut fries that were equally good. All for $11! The soup and salad was pretty standard, though the Ceasar dressing for the salad was quite tasty and definitely one of the better Ceasar's I've had. The pizza was quite large for a ""medium"", as much food as a normal ""large"" pizza would be at any of the pizza chains. Excellent dough, perfect amount of sauce, and loaded with fresh veggies, cheese, and meat. Great combination that made me steal an extra half of a slice ;). Our total bill came out to around $54 which was a great value for 4 people to fill up to great food. I was completely stuffed as were the rest of my party.

It was off their menu and it came with frozen peaches. The whole drink was loaded with so much sugar I tried to water it down and the before and the after the drink was still not even drinkable. I thought for sure the bartender or person who created the drink wanted to give me and everyone else who ordered it diabetes. I just pushed it aside and could not drink it. Our server might as well be a servant. She had no personality and besides taking our order and dropping our items off, she was clueless. Had she been an attentive server she would have noticed my drink was horrible but however I paid the bill and will never order that drink again. Next time I went there I figured I should at least give this place a second try. Well the appetizer I ordered was alright but I ordered another cocktail off their menu, something different. Wrong! what I learned is do not ever try any cocktails off their menu. A man with no taste buds created it. The drink looked pretty in the picture, it came out looking different and it sure did not taste good. I pushed it aside and this server of course did not recognize my dislike for this cocktails. Moral of story, ask for advise when ordering. Too many items on the menu that are horrible.

Dru C.,"Orange County, CA",658,833,2262,3.0,4/21/2009,"I admit it, I'm a fan of the Pizookie. I know it's just a oversized cookie in a deep dish with a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream on top, but I always feel like bustin' a move on top of the table and doing a little shimmy every time I take a bite out of it. Pipin' hot out of the oven, I love the slightly soft and chewy texture on the inside of the cookie. The white chocolate macadamia nut is my favorite, and I could probably polish off 2 or 3 Pizookies in one sitting. Hey BJ's, how about a Pizookie eating contest? I'll be first in line, waiting with a large white bib, two huge spoons, and a grin from ear to ear. One other thing that I liked were the avocado egg rolls. Now I've tried the Cheesecake Factory version many times, and I must say that BJ's version is a lot less oily and heavy. Plus, they don't go overboard with TOO much avocado.  The deep dish pizza? I always end up ordering one, but by the second slice, I'm already sick of it. As an unabashed fan of thin crust NY-style pizza, the concept of the deep dish intrigues me, but I have yet to experience TRUE and authentic deep dish pizza.

They get your order wrong...EVERY TIME.  And it's not like I order anything special or complicated.  If you ask for something, you have to ask 4 different servers and maybe one of them will will help you, but usually not.  The wait time to get your food is ridiculous even in non-peak hours and the wait to get your check is even longer.

I had the gluten free pizza. it was mediocre at best. I ordered it with garlic and spinach. I did not taste any garlic and there were about 5 small pieces of spinach on the entire pizza. I think the spinach was placed on after the pizza was cooked because it was just loosely laying on top of the pizza. The crust was thin (which I like) but it was not at all crispy. The pizza was bland. The iced tea was very good. Service was pretty good. i would definitely go back one more time to try something different as I did enjoy the atmosphere.  Hopefully I would make a better menu choice next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=380

I prefer to spend my money at the more mom & pop places to help keep them afloat.  Friends invited us out and they chose this place for dinner, so we (wife and I) reluctantly went.  What a surprise! We enjoyed everything about the place, from the wait staff to the excellent food.  I had the opened face meat loaf sandwich and I hate to say it but it was much, much, better than my dear ol' mom's (RIP). The mashed/whipped potatoes and fried onion strings atop it made it fantastic! What a combination to ignite the taste buds. The wife had the pulled pork plate and raved about it and their BBQ sauce. I pride myself in my own homemade sauce so I got hurt feelings :-(  The appetizers were awesome, but quite expensive, especially the avocado rolls.  When we have a few extra bucks and don't want to hit one of the mom & pop places we will definitely return.

Josh M.,"San Diego, CA",275,521,,3.0,8/22/2009,"BJ's was a real go-to place for lunch, back when there was only one in town and deep-dish pizza in San Diego seemed to have died out with the Chicago Brothers (and doesn't that reference just date me).  Of course, in 2009 Chicago-style pizza is available at every corner drugstore. BJ's was losing some of its cachet, and so they expanded their menu in two directions.  First: more sandwiches, salads and non-pizza entrees.  It hasn't reached Yardhouse or Cheesecake Factory levels yet, but I can see a future where that happens. Second, they jumped onto the beer wagon. I have to respect their attempts to make craft beer safe for malls.  They currently offer a decent selection of crafts and imports.  Perhaps more impressive, most BJ's now have special brewery nights when they host outside brew to pair with their food (and despite the timeless classic of pizza and beer, it helps that they expanded #1, above).  It's good bit of corporate generosity (and humillity), since their own chain-brew averages about two stars. Nitpick: if they mean to be taken seriously as a brewpub, they need to better educate their waitstaff on the type and flavor of a possibly esoteric tap.   Double nitpick:  please, don't mis-correct my pronunciation when I order a Smithwick's.  You're only helping to make future Irish pub waiters even more smug. Their service (as a chain) is a little odd; take-out is sometimes delegated to one staffer, and even when idle, undesignated staff will be unable to assist you.   Service quirks aside, another chain safe for the 'rents.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=400

That's impressive to me since I usually refuse to drink a heff w/o my lemon!  On this day however, I was drinking iced tea. For lunch I had the Grilled Chicken Club with a side salad & wedge cut fries. This was a verrrrrry yummy lunch! First the salad was crisp & fresh with the perfect amount of dressing. As for the sandwich......OMG! Sooooooo good! Presentation is your average. Nothing special. Didn't care. The sandwich is 1 large chicken breast half (or whole, wasn't sure but, it was plenty of meat) layed over two thick cut pieces of white bread lightly toasted with a yummy buttery flavor that the sandwich wouldn't be the same without. Inside to keep this yummy chicken company is more crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, & avocado with again, a perfect amount of swiss cheese to tie it all together.  Another yummy appitizer I've tried in the past is there Brushetta! I've been to Italy and had the real, fresh, oh so delishous brushetta & BJ's version stands bold beside it!

Dave L.,"Temecula, CA",5,11,2,4.0,4/22/2008,"I'm not big on chain-restaurants, but I AM big on beer so when BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse opened up in Temecula a couple of years back I was excited to give them a try.  Not only did I enjoy my first outting there with my family but have been back a few times since. My most recent outing was this past weekend.  It was my wife's birthday and SHE CHOSE to go there.  I'd say that speaks volumes about their food, but I'm sure it had to do with the Pizookie. BJ's in Temecula is on the corner of Ynez & Overland - across the street from Cosco.  It usually appears quite busy but the wait never seems to be very long.  Each time I've gone it was with a party of at least 6 or more.  The service for me has consistently been good and they've always been real friendly to my kids which is a big plus as you'd be surprised how often wait staff barely pay attention to the little ones.   Personally the trip to BJ's is always about spending some good quality time with my company and enjoying some good food & drink.  Personally I like most of their handcrafted beers, but my personal favorites are their Hefeweizen, Irish Red Ale, Tatonka Stout and nutty Brown Ale, but if you haven't had any yet I'd recommend the sampler.  Of course they do have other beers to choose from, but why bother? This past weekend we had a very friendly waitress who was more than happy to make some very good martini suggestions for my wife and my mother-in-law.  I can probably go on and on about the food, but its a chain restaurant and the faire is pretty standard.  Nothing to blow you away, but nothing will disappoint either.  The crown jewel to BJ's though is their Pizookie - a warm baked cookie served large and round like a pizza and topped with a mound of ice cream.  Needless to say the kids love this.   My only complaint about this particular BJ's is that the front door faces West.  So what?  Well when you sit down for dinner and the sun is setting... you better hope you're not sitting right in its path as everytime the front doors open you'll get an eyeful of sun.  Not very comfortable.  I try to be sure we're seated off to the side somewhere.  Other than that the atmosphere is great, the prices aren't outrageous and the staff friendly.  I've been there a few times and I have no reservations about going back for more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=440

Deirdre M.,"Chicago, IL",77,119,4,1.0,2/9/2010,"I love BJ's. They have amazing food, and the service is always great, but I am absolutely not a fan of the Temecula location.  I came here with my family for my late 21st birthday dinner and it was actually so terrible that we left. My mom, Dad, Brother, Grandma, Boyfriend and I arrived at about 6:30 (I called to make reservations, but they don't do them unless it's more than 8 people) and were escorted down the stairs to the main dining room. Did I mention that my grandma uses a walker and my dad uses a cane? Well Bj's isn't very handicapped accessible, so it was either try to meander through the crowded bar area and down the ramp, or go down the stairs.  Once we were seated, our waitress came over. She was definitely on something. My parents and I got a pitcher of beer, my boyfriend got an Arnold palmer, and the rest got water. About 15 minutes later we were served a single glass of beer and a glass of iced tea. Huh? When we told the waitress the mistake she came back with the Arnold palmer and some water glasses....which she proceeded to pour on the poor man at the table next to us. Then she just seemed to forget about our table, while I was down on the floor wiping up the water she forgot to tell anybody about.  At this point we looked around and noticed that everybody seemed to be getting bad service. Some people were finished with their meal, while the other people at their table hadn't even been served yet. We decided to leave. The general manager, Michelle, escorted us out the back door so we wouldn't have to go up the stairs, was very apologetic, and gave us a gift card. I felt really bad, but this wasn't the first time I've gotten sub-par service at this location.

When it finally came to my table I was approached by a very rude lady who I'm guessing was the manager, I told her how now it was pointless of me eating it because everyone was ready to go. Instead of offering a fix to the problem she simply took the plate and walked away instead of apologizing and trying to make it okay because this restaurants quote is ""they give the best never compromise"".

They have a few blends listed on the menu, but really they can do any kind you want. I like the Berry Burst Cider blended with the BJ Beachouse Blonde. Yummy! We are big sliders fans and usually order them if they are on the menu at any restaurant we go to, but have found the Angus beef sliders at BJ's to be our favorite. We add cheese to them, as they don't come with it regularly. Next, it's on to the Sweet Pig pizza. I like to substitute pepporoni for the ham.

The atmosphere is ok, though it can be noisey. Service is good and the prices are reasonable. Try the beer sampler for something different. And, of course, save room for desert!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=460
Nadine T.,"Temecula, CA",0,11,,4.0,2/7/2009,"I decided to give BJs a shot, and I really liked it.  They have some lunch specials from $5.95.  I hade the soup (clam chowder) and sandwich combo (which was supposed to be the grilled chicken club) for $6.95.  The chowder was a good, generous portion with lots of clams.  The sandwich I had was good too, but it wasn't what I ordered.  The waitress gave me the wrong order and when I asked her if this was the correct sandwich, she said it was and we ate it.  The bill came, and it turned out it was incorrect, but she really didn't seem to care.  The sandwich was good, but not what I wanted.  Anyway, it was a pretty good lunch and I'll probably go back.  Also, their strawberry lemonade was yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-temecula?start=460
