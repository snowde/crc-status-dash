Elizabeth J.,"Baltimore, MD",179,252,104,3.0,4/25/2016,"We stopped in to grab a beer and a snack before our movie. Nothing special, but it did the trick. Great selection of beer, but the bar tender was moving a little slow and not familiar with the menu. Nothing to write home about, but good enough for a pre-show brew.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Kevin J.,"Evesham Township, NJ",39,207,11,4.0,6/29/2015,"I had a great experience at BJ's on Sunday night.  Beer- I tried the hefferveisen and my wife got the stout. We both liked the beers. The stout was better and had a unique taste. The hefferviesen was not heavy enough for my liking, but it was still good. Not enough heff! The price point at $5.75 a beer is a little steep. I heard they have a happy hour. I will come back one night and sample more of their brews during that time.  Food- The food was excellent. Their menu is huge, maybe too huge. I had a double burger and my wife had some kind of chicken sandwich. Both were great, had flavor, large proportions and were reasonably priced. Their thinly cut French fries are awesome! I saw a couple deep dish pizza's around them room. They looked good. Atmosphere- Nothing crazy to report home about. It was clean, new, and spacious. Looked like there was plenty of space at the bar and adequate seating.  Service- Top notch! Attentive hostesses and wait staff.  Other- They have a decent rewards program I signed up for. Check it out at their website before they go. Apparently you can pay via app. I did't do this, but that seems new and high tech.   There are now a ton of good restaurants in that square there by the movie theater. This is one of the better ones. I will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Robert B.,"Towson, MD",1,21,,2.0,7/30/2016,"Serviceable but not much more. Table service was good. Nice clean bathroom. Hostess seemed like she was attached to an unreliable motion detector -- she was staring at nothing when we came in, then eventually noticed we were there and flipped to the ""on"" position. It's a bar and grill, so we got burgers, the hickory brisket burger and sliders. The burger was ordered medium and definitely wasn't -- I have no idea why restaurants incapable of cooking to order bother to ask. The sliders were *very* greasy. The shoestring fries were good, nice and crispy. Not the worst I've had by any means, but there's not really much reason to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Allison T.,"Rosedale, MD",34,5,2,4.0,7/21/2016,"We came in relatively late, and sat around waiting for the rest of our party which is really annoying to servers, but Elisse (sorry is spelling isn't correct) was a breath of fresh air. Very pleasant and wonderful. We will be coming back for her and your awesome rewards program. Oh and of course the pizookies!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Irene A.,"Ocean City, MD",14,4,,4.0,1/15/2017,Food was good. I had the grilled chicken breast which was cooked nice. My son had the kids burger which he did not like because he did not like the flavor. The wings were delicious and so was everything else. I would like to come again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Austin W.,"Manchester, CT",1,41,13,3.0,5/19/2016,"The pizza isn't anything special. The dough has so much air in it, making it so fluffy, that they barely put any toppings on it but it still gives the illusion that you're eating a lot of pizza. I might as well have been eating just bread. On the plus side it's not a very greasy pizza so you don't have to worry about pools of oil on the pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Keisha C.,"Baltimore, MD",35,25,119,3.0,7/23/2015,"Don't usually like chain restaurants but they places was pretty good. The large bar area was clean, invited and large. I like that they have outdoor seating available, which is a nice benefit for warm weather months. The vast menu allowed for great food options to choose from. Service was attentive. The only negative is that the entrees are pretty pricey for a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Vincent D.,"Towson, MD",25,88,284,2.0,4/10/2016,Came here on a week night. Place had about 8 tables occupied and some patrons at the bar.  Not a busy night. The place was nice. Our waitress was nice and the food was ok. However... I saw some people (at different times) waiting (some left) at the entrance because there was no one there to seat them. Some customers left without ordering- I guess no one was paying them attention. The guy who brought us our food just turned around and walked away- while my friend was still talking asking for ketchup. This place could be better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Emily B.,"Towson, MD",35,10,,3.0,4/23/2016,Went for dinner last night and had a big comfy booth for just the two of us. We sat for about 10-15 minutes before our waitress realized we were there. Food came out in a decent amount of time and was hot. Ingredients seemed fresh and food was very good. Service was incredibly slow and we were never given utensils. We had to find another server to bring napkins since ours was MIA so often. Staff all looked miserable and were slow but the food was good. Probably won't go back again for a meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Valerie N.,"Parkville, MD",0,36,,3.0,8/16/2015,"I continue to have a great experience here, and it's been my third time dining at BJ's.  They have a great beer selection, the bar tenders are good-natured, and the food is delicious.  They also have a neat happy hour from 3-6 on weekdays and also during aired football games.  They offer discounted appetizers, pizzas, and drinks on their happy hour. Overall a really cool place, making it one of our go-to restaurants in the area.  I'd recommend their deep dish pizzas and Hefeweizen beer.  It's a delicious combo! Edit:  since my original review, their happy hour has turned into just a dollar off of their drafts.  Also, the food comes out extremely slowly and there has been many mistakes with orders.  I have tried contacting management to bring this to their attention, but no response.  It's a shame that I felt the need to adjust the rating from a 5 to a 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Sarah G.,"Arlington, VA",220,336,92,4.0,1/25/2016,"Bar only review! A friend and I came in here to kill some time before a movie at the Cinemark a block away. It was a perfect spot for that, and despite large Saturday night crowds, we found some spots at the bar. Our bartender was right with us with  menus and giving us the specials. They had drink specials for the games that were playing on the numerous TVs. I ended up ordering a berry beer which I thought was a cider since it was listed under ""Cider & Fruit Beers"" but my eyes only read Cider lol. Surprisingly (even though I really don't like beer) this was super tasty! Probably because it tasted nothing like beer, but more like a fruit wine spritzer aka super girly but I don't care! It was really refreshing and easy to drink. Our bartender even gave me a shot's worth of the Berry Burst Cider which they have an option to mix with the Belgian fruit beer I was drinking. Very tasty together! It's a great spot that I'd love to try out in the future because the food that was coming out around us looked really good too. Plus with other locations closer to my work, it shouldn't be too hard to find the time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Michel D.,"Gunpowder, MD",0,3,,4.0,10/16/2016,"We arrived around 5:00 PM on a Sunday. Admittedly not a real busy time of the week for a restaurant. The wait staff was courteous and attentive. We ordered two pizzas, bacon with chicken and a Mediterranean, and a BBQ bison burger. The food was good and well presented. My only complaint was the beer. While they have a large selection of beer on tap, all the beer is kept at about 37 degrees Fahrenheit. This is fine for most lagers and ales but is too cold for porters and stouts, the finish tends to be bitter unless porters and stouts are kept at about 50 degrees. A bit disappointing since I'm a fan of dark beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Geo F.,"Gwynn Oak, Gwynn Oak, MD",0,1,,1.0,5/13/2017,"Left a movie, and walked in to BJ's and a young lady who was a hostess told me that a young man who had started to walk away would be with me to place my carry out order. She then called him while he ran to the kitchen and asked him to take my order when he came back. When he came back almost ten minutes later, he had his jacket on and back pack, ready to go out the door. Before he left, he was ""kind"" enough to tell me, while walking back into the carry out booth, that I should place my order at the bar. This was around 10:30 this evening of May 13th. There were two girls and this guy I spoke to on tonight's shift. Sad.....because we went somewhere else and the restaurant lost business only because of a young guy that was rude and thought he was being slick. Took us for being stupid making us wait while he got his jacket and backpack to make his exit. Get some customer service training and if you don't know how to act like an adult in the service business, go do something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Jalina M.,"Baltimore, MD",3,4,,2.0,4/7/2016,"This was my first visit to this restaurant and my husbands second. He advised against this restaurant due to his lackluster food on his initial visit. I thought maybe they were having an off day and his pizza wasn't delicious that one time and another shot should be given. Boy was I wrong!  The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Our waitress was between rude and slightly nice? She was not excited at all and her demeanor was as if she had better things to be doing instead of being a polite server. We also noticed there were cliques of employees and lots of standing around doing nothing, this isn't optimal behavior at a restaurant. Now on to the food, the root beer wings were really good. The deep dish pizza was not- tasteless and no sauce to speak of, crust was buttery and greasy and the waitress wasn't surprised I said something about the lack of sauce she just brought out a cup of marinara sauce... I'm sad to say that we didn't even order dessert because I didn't want to be disappointed with that. Also I'd like to add I was disappointed by the response to the no sauce on the pizza, she didn't even inquire if we wanted a new pizza made, she just brought the sauce which was tacky in my opinion. I also think with a complaint like that, a manager should've been notified to inquire how the experience can be upgraded to encourage another visit. So maybe this review will help you to determine if this the place to go for your next dining out experience, I'm not saying I'll never go back but I hope that they get better service and food before I do. If I could sum up the experience, I'd call it bad service with a smile...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Mimi A.,"Riverdale Park, MD",91,4,1,5.0,3/6/2016,"So this week was one of my best friends' birthday and as a last minute thing after going empire his kids to Port Discovery, I told him I wanted to get something to eat/take him out to eat for his bday.  As a last minute thing, he suggested horseshoe casino m, because they have good food there.  I told him I DID NOT want burgers, that I wanted real dinner-type food.  So first place we checked out was the steakhouse on the bottom floor.  The menu looked great, but my friend didn't seem like he was feeling it, because it was a little too stuffy for him.  He really seemed interested in going to Guy Fieri's place, so I said ""OK let's go check out the menu.""  From the second that we walked up there, he was hooked just by the friendliness of the hostesses, of course, I still had to check out the menu. I ended up seeing that they had more than just burgers and agreed that it'd be a cool place to eat.  Our server was Monique, a super friendly, super knowledgeable waitress who gave us great service! Then, at some point, the restaurant manager came by to stop by and say hello, which seems to be standard these days, but my friend happen to know her so that made the experience even cooler, but what I was really blown away by was that towards the end of our meal, the general manager came by to say hi and see how things were going, asked if we needed anything, to which I replied, ""yes, everything is GREAT, but if I could get a to-go ramekin for this sauce I'd really appreciate it.""  She tells me, ""sure, of course!"" and then proceeds to buss our table!!!  Let me repeat that, the general manager bussed our table!!  Not only that, but she brought back good to-go ramekins herself and didn't send someone to bring them to me!  I got some Hawaiian chicken bbq dish that I wasn't blown away by, but my friend LOVED his burger and I would DEFINITELY, 100% come back to this place for the experience that you get starting at the front door and beyond!  There was another guy who kept coming by our table and I don't know what his position was there, but he was also super friendly and funny.  Definitely check out this place, especially if you're someone who appreciates great service!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Jessica D.,"Atlanta, GA",270,215,187,4.0,11/16/2015,I've been here a few times. For the most part the food is decent nothing to be excited about. Although being from Atlanta I was happy to find lemon pepper wings on the menu. The one thing I would say on the menu that is worth getting excited about it the pazzoki. My mouth waters just thinking about it and they have a couple different flavors. I've had the macadamia nut as well as the salted caramel both absolutely amazing. I tend to sit at the bar when I come. The service is usually pretty good although if it gets busy they tend to forget about you. There is one bartender she usually works during the day from what I see but she has a thick southern accent and she's always very sweet if you ever get the pleasure. I recommend coming on Tuesdays they have half off wine glasses and bottles which I can't resist especially since I'm not a fan of beer. During happy hour they have beer specials and $2 off apps. BJs is always cool for a quick bite before a movie so check them out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Courtney S.,"Davidsonville, MD",41,41,49,5.0,2/16/2016,"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants and I'm thrilled to see its in Towson now! There are very few places around here that you can get a decent deep dish pizza, so now that BJ's is here you'll never have to resist your deep dish cravings anymore. And if you love dessert? Their pizookie (my favorite is the peanut butter s'mores) will make you come back in a heartbeat. Check it out, I highly recommend it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Erika H.,"Columbia, MD",77,39,45,3.0,3/29/2016,Normally love BJ's but don't go there on a weekday at night. We waited 5 minutes or more at the hostess desk before we were even acknowledged. Then we were seated and sat there 15 more minutes without anyone ever coming over to even take drink orders. There were a good amount of people there and more coming in so you'd think they'd make sure everyone was taken care of but all the staff seemed to be totally uninterested and moving too slow. So we left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Kate R.,"Cockeysville, MD",10,4,,5.0,10/2/2015,"We don't go out to eat often so it's always a bummer when we have a disappointing experience. Such was not the case AT ALL with BJ's. We couldn't have been more thrilled. In fact, I think we were in a better mood when we left than we were when we got there! The food is pretty much what you would expect if you're looking for pub-type fare but I couldn't believe the options. It wasn't just burgers and wings, there were so many interesting things on the menu. I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken which was delicious. I love that they have an ""EnLIGHTened"" portion of their menu.  The food was good but the staff was incredible. We ordered a pitcher of beer and realized pretty soon that the waitress brought us the wrong beer. We let her know and she apologized and told us to just finish the pitcher we had and that she would bring a new one with the beer that we ordered at no extra cost to us. That was pretty much all my boyfriend needed to hear. It was a simple gesture but it goes a long way in terms of customer service. She was quick, attentive but not TOO attentive, friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. It wasn't just her though, the hostess was great and every single staff member that we encountered was friendly and just GOOD at their job. We even called the manager over to let her know how impressed we were. We were there once before but just had drinks at the bar and the bartender was SO friendly and engaging. She overheard us talking about movies and ended up talking movies with us for the next ten minutes which was so fun. Oh and I would be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible beer selection.  Often times when you go out to eat, if a waiter or waitress isn't assigned to a table then they don't want to help that table and I get that. They work on tips and every second counts so I wouldn't hold that against anyone. But it seems like the staff at BJ's is trained to treat every single customer well regardless of whether or not they'll be tipped by that customer. It's rare and it's truly impressive.  I hope the place sticks around for a long time and I hope that a lot of people have the amazing experience that my boyfriend and I had. I really can't wait to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Cassandra R.,"Baltimore, MD",38,11,72,3.0,10/22/2015,"Nice new bar near the mall and moive theater. Great for watching sports because they've got these HUGE HD flat screens long the perimiter of the bar. I only went for drinks so I can't speak on the food. I ordered a drink called ""A Drink Like That""....its probably one of the strongest drinks b/c it's got 151 in it. Very Tasty....like a firecracker ice cream pop in a drink. I had two and was done for the night. Cool vibes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=80
Matthew S.,"Baltimore, MD",220,124,100,4.0,11/1/2017,"Stopped in for lunch on Sunday and couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience. The restaurant was clean, the staff (waitress, hostess, food runners) were friendly, and the food was amazing. Myself and four friends all left feeling very satiated and can't wait to return! I got the Enlightened Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and WOW. Diced grilled chicken paired with a cucumber, tomato, red onion, and feta ""salsa"" which is them topped with cilantro and a creamy yogurt sauce. The pita they envelope it in is seriously heavenly. Warm and soft, just like you'd expect it to be and more. Served alongside a huge serving of grain salad and just the right amount of both. Finished the whole entree and it left me feeling full without being overstuffed - perfecto.  Friends all loved their entrees as well. Salads are large and filled with fresh, seasonal ingredients. The Parmesan Crusted chicken was   and the portion was larger than life. Literally enough for 2, even 3, meals. Side of brocolli that it comes with could have used some extra seasoning but the chicken and mashed potatoes more than made up for it's lack thereof. My only regret is not getting our waitresses name so I could drip it here. She was amazing. Claimed to have tried every item on the menu (which is huge so we were a bit skeptical) but proved herself right when she was able to quickly rattle off her personal likes and dislikes about all the items we were contemplating and then ranked them in order from best to worst. She was seriously amazing and will definitely be getting return service the next time we stop in!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson
Kendra R.,"Randallstown, MD",140,116,133,3.0,11/12/2017,"I had a great time here. The service was great and the food LOOOKED good. I said looked because I ended up sending my barbacoa tacos back. They had a horrible stench to them. They looked great, but I couldn't stomach the smell. I'm excited to return to try some other food items because every picture on the menu made me want to try it. I didn't order another entrée, I opted for dessert instead. I was thoroughly please with my white macadamia nut pikoozie. Absolutely delicious. Parking in Towson is always a pain especially if you're not wanting to use the garage. I lucked up and found a spot right out front. I look forward to returning here and trying something else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson
Jude T.,"Parkville, MD",78,387,372,3.0,9/19/2017,"A solid three. This place is a chain restaurant, but it's a good chain restaurant - it's what Friday's could be and maybe is trying to be. However, it's STILL a chain restaurant, and that's important to remember.  BJ's has a good beer list, including their own, which is the real center of attention, I guess. Their actual menu is quite bloated and far too large, much like a lot of other chains (looking at you, CCF, especially). You have options here, but because there are so many things it means some of the things aren't going to be as great as the others - no restaurant staff can learn all of these items and prepare them perfectly each time. They have flatbread pizzas, burgers, tacos, ribs, sandwiches, wraps, salads, fish...far too many options. As for what we had? Two people ordered burgers, both MW. One was a bit dry with one side closer to well-done and a little black, but the other burger was perfect MW. The flatbread pizza appetizer was actually pretty good - I liked the sauce a lot.  I had the fish and chips, and the fish was cooked well with a nice breading but maybe a little greasier than expected or wanted.  All meals came with fries and the fries were actually good restaurant fries! Waitress was very nice and came back with an extra drink when I asked for a refill, so that's cool. OTOH we didn't even get a person to ask us for drinks until we had been there for about 10 minutes, so service can be slow. In the end, the food can be good, but some things are better than others...and it's a brewhouse that's trying to be a sports bar (tons of TVs and the clientele is definitely sports fans on a Sunday) and because of this, it fails to live up to its true potential.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson
Nick H.,"Baltimore, MD",30,18,2,2.0,1/6/2018,We have eaten here twice now. The first time was ok. Nothing stellar but nothing amazing. Food was fine and service was average. Unmemorable. So we came back recently to try this place again. The service was very slow. Snail slow. Having food in front of me for 10 minutes without silverware. Come on. Flagged down another server and it took flagging down a third to get to job done. 20 minutes with food in front of me and not able to eat it may have affected my roon temperature impression of my meal. Unfortunately this place was more memorable a second time. They have craft beer but I soent all my time trying to eat I didnt have a chance to actually enjoy this aspect. Will most likely not return. Its a great concept poorly executed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson
Johnny P.,"Towson, MD",27,19,59,4.0,12/20/2017,"Love this place after a movie in Towson or when the friends get together, also pretty nice place for a date. So many options on the menu! Favorites  Pulled pork and the root beer glazed ribs. Save room for dessert the monkey bread pizzokie is soo freaking good! Deff gotta try that if you go. Prices aren't crazy high about the same as any other chain restaurant.

Toy S.,"Owings Mills, MD",78,90,100,4.0,6/21/2017,"BJ's is good for what is, a cool place to eat wings and watch the game.  Whenever I have free time after going to Cinemark theater, I always walk out of the theater and to BJ's. Their selection of personalized beer is tasty (TATONKA is my favorite)  and I love, love, love their homemade pizza. The sauce is always just right.  What annoys me with BJ's, and is the reason I can't give them five stars is because no matter when I come I have to ask someone to wipe off the bar or the table before I sit down. And I mean every time!!! I don't know what goes down at night but there is always so much food gook on it and the morning crew must be like FORGET IT! But the staff members are always nice when asked.  The service in general is a guessing game. If I sit at the bar it's pretty good. It doesn't hurt that the hour I go it's desolate, just the way I like it.  Still, during football and basketball season they get crazy busy, in a good way!

Tiffany D.,"Baltimore, MD",136,97,196,3.0,11/29/2017,"I came here to have dinner before my movie. My overall experience was great, but the food items were mediocre. The server was very nice and personable and truly made our entire experience. On another note, some of the restaurant practices were blah. They call themselves a brew house but didn't offer tastings of their wine or beers. So I ended up going safe instead of trying something new. Next, I ordered from their  $10 menu, and it was to be expected that it wouldn't be much to write home about. I was satisfied with my meal, but my girlfriend didnt care for hers. At the end, I got dessert and that was really good and on discount. Bottomline- I would go back again for dessert and half priced wine.... and maybe even to try a signature item before I completely write them off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson
Cynthia F.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",127,194,483,3.0,6/10/2017,"Came to BJ's last night for dinner before we went to a movie at the theater. We caught the last 15 minutes of happy hour. They brew their own beer, so BF and I decided to try some of their brews. I got the Jeremiah Red which is a red ale, and BF got a mango IPA. I wasn't a big fan of my beer, but i thought his mango IPA was pretty good. We started with the stuffed mushrooms. They were pretty good and I loved the pesto drizzle. BF got a guacamole bacon burger and I got a mini deep dish pizza. The deep dish pizza's were half off during happy hour. BF really liked his burger, and I was a fan of the fries that he got with them. My pizza was SO greasy. The pizza itself tasted good but the crust was just a sponge of grease. I am the type of person who feels like I always have to finish the food in front of me so I finished it anyway. All during the movie I had a stomach ache which I think was caused by how greasy the pizza was. I would still return, but if I ordered a deep dish pizza I would make sure it wasn't as greasy, or just try something different on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson

Waited over 10 mins to be greeted and to order drinks. 2 Appetizers (one that was RAW) took 45 mins. Dinner then came while we were eating the apps. Never checked on us. Food was mediocre at best.  We asked for the check and it took ANOTHER 15 mins while we watched the staff standing around in the kitchen. The staff was actually arguing with eachother in front of us. Hostess looked to be in tears at one point. It was so bad but there was no manager in sight so we just paid the bill and left.

You're probably not coming to this place for asparagus but I had to attempt to have something healthy on my plate so don't judge me ok?!

The third time included food. I purchased a deep dish pizza, which after traveling to Chicago is one of my favorite styles of pizza. What we received was lackluster.

She told us there would be no charge, but still charged us for the chips and guac that we didnt order bit she said to just go ahead and eat.

I ordered a glazed salmon and they ordered a blackened salmon. The glazed salmon was very sweet yet cooked correctly. The blackened salmon was over cooked and drive as we needed to use a fork and knife to cut it.

The inside of the restaurant itself is pretty nice, and the bar area is also decent with a bunch of HDTV's around the whole bar area. They have all kinds of beers you can choose from as well, so if you're a beer drinker, you might want to try this place out. Their desserts are also pretty good.

The only good thing this place has going for it is the beer selection. I guess the service from the wait staff was also acceptable, but still not enough to give this place two stars. Open, airy space. Got a Chilis vibe going on. Multiple TV's.  Menu is rather large and too extensive, which is probably part of the problem. Menu is also kind of boring. Nothing really special or eye catching. Typical stuff like burgers, salad, sandwiches, pizza, etc. Started off with the potato skins as an appetizer. Boy were they bland. Tasteless. My partner ordered the black & bleu burger and he could not finish it because it was so bland. The fries that came with the burger were of the shoestring variety. They also lacked salt.  I ordered the Kale & Brussel sprout salad with chicken. It was awful. It was a super soggy mess and I could not finish it. Why was it so soggy and floppy? The dressing that it had been soaking in was not good either - strawberry vinaigrette. Didn't really taste of much other than vinegar. The salad was supposed to have goat cheese in it, but it definitely had bleu cheese in it. Bleh.

The appetizers were mushy and greasy - the avocado spring roll thing is terrible.  Drinks were watered down and really sugary. The only reason for two stars - service was fine and the beer selection was pretty good.  They did some cool ""layering"" with their beers.  Aside from that, I would strongly avoid this place.  Their menu is so expansive that instead of making 15-20 quality items, they have 200+ terrible items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=60

While the decor and building itself has very good architecture and the fire place outside is an eye catcher. The food defiantly leaves you dissatisfied. The food was similar to that of a Chilis or a tgi Friday's with the exception of an incredible beer menu. I did try the banana beer which was tasty.  The country fried chicken with gravy was truly an embarrassment, being from the south I know what country fried chicken is supposed to be like. The chicken was extremely dry and sadly placed upon a mediocre pile of less then desirable mashed potatoes and the dish was decorated with corn kernels as if it was a decoration not a side. The gravy was thick and lacked flavor. The avocado egg rolls were the worse. The sauces did not accompany the appetizer well and tasted very similar. They were not crispy and were soggy in less then a few minutes. No one at the table was satisfied with them.  My friend ordered the flatbread and salad and he was not that impressed either For dessert we shared the pazookie which is a cookie with ice cream which was expressed to be the best dessert and in reality all it is, is a big cookie overly sweet and soft almost undercooked with store bought ice cream on top with some kind of drizzle depending upon what you order... Defiantly seems like a lower end restaurant presenting itself as upscale. With a clientel base of college students and late night drinkers. personally have no desire to return in the near future.

The salad was very good, I should have requested no blue cheese crumbles since I'm not a huge fan of them. The buffalo pizza was okay, but it looked amazing. I would recommend putting more buffalo sauce on the pizza, I hardly taste any actually. My bestfriend meat pizza was good. Overall I would definitely recommend this place.

Upon walking in the two hosts seemed a little clueless, they did multiple double takes at each other before picking up some menus and taking our small party of two to a table close to the bar. We had two waitresses for some reason, one that got drinks and another that was very aloof that admitted to us she was in her own world in her head. Had to flag her down to order, get sauce, check...  Me and my friend came in Tuesday which is apparently half price wine glass and bottle night . I approve of that! For dinner I decided to be a little bland and ordered the chicken club, my friend got a jalapeño burger. Both came out very timely and hot. I love these kind of shoe string fries, crispy yet flavorful. Chicken could of been seasoned a bit more and the bread ended up a little soggy but overall ingredients were fresh and well cooked. Great place to stop in for dinner pre movie.  Only tip is for service to improve a bit, both at the front of the restaurant when you walk in as well as the servers at table side.

There are lots of TVs showing sports, which is everywhere now, but it's not obtrusive. The burger with fried jalapeños is awesome, the fried jalapeños should be an appetizer. The calamari is really good. One negative, the queso with the chips is so hit or miss. When it's good it's the best but sometimes it's like to bottom of the barrel and barely edible, about 50% of the time, and never enough chips. It seems like an easy thing to fix.

The food came quickly and we jumped on some fries - they serve very skinny, well done fries which we thought were great - similar to Smashburger fries...probably previously frozen but delicious nonetheless (that was for Adam D who sees frozen fries as a dealbreaker).  My daughter LOVED her fish...yes, it's just fried fish, but it wasn't too greasy and was very flavorful.  My burger was done just as I requested (medium) and the brisket and bacon topping was a home run.   Since neither of us had eaten a real dinner, we also ordered dessert...a Pizzookie Trio.  If you've never had a Pizzookie, it's a 3""=4"" cookie served HOT in a small metal ramekin-like dish and topped with ice cream...UMMMMMMMMMM, OK!!!!!!   We had the Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia, and the Triple Chocolate made with Ghirardelli Chocolate.  First off, when you order the trio you should actually have three people as ONE Pizzookie and ice cream is enough for one person...However, full disclosure-I don't like leaving delicious food on the table so I toughed it out.   I was really pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed our meal.  I like being able to spend time with the kids eating out like this as I know it will be short lived as they will be off to college sooner than I know.  I could EASILY return to BJs for another meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=40

On the first visit, they put in the wrong pizza size for D, and brought out the erroneous one AND the right one, at different times, even though we told them to just go with the wrong one (and they're the ones that pointed out the error). On the second visit, they forgot his salad, and the third visit, they forgot our fries. The seared ahi salad is great, quite a lot of flavor and very fresh. It does have a somewhat hidden streak of wasabi running through it, so be warned of sudden heat. The mahi mahi and shrimp tacos are good, though the multitude of sauces get a little muddled together. Mahi mahi was fresher than the shrimp, though the shrimp did have good texture. From the appetizers, the calamari is decent (nothing super special, just what you'd expect from fried calamari), and the ahi poke is good if a little too acidic by the end of the dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=40

I specified I would not like any bread crumbs in my pasta, as well. After waiting for about 30 minutes, our food was brought out to us. This was the SECOND time we were seeing our waitress. She did not come check in on us while we were waiting to see if we needed anything. Yet again, she forgot to bring the lemons, although at this point, I was beginning to feel it was deliberate.  At this point, I tried pushing my frustrations aside and focusing on my meal, which I order regularly and am very familiar with. Unfortunately, my entree was on par with the customer service we were receiving... highly disappointing. There were barely 4 pieces of shrimp thrown into my pasta and of course, there were breadcrumbs.  I began looking for my waitress to let her know my food was not acceptable, however she was NO WHERE to be found. Yet again, she was not checking on us AT ALL. As I sat there and waited, everyone else at my table was eating their food. This was supposed to be my first real meal of the day, considering I worked all day, and I had really been looking forward to it. By the time our waitress finally showed up, I had eaten most of my meal. This was the third time we were seeing our waitress that night. She did not come check on us while we were waiting for our food, and she did not come check on us while we were eating our food. It was obvious she was not committed to providing us the customer service we usually receive at this restaurant. Nonetheless, I went ahead and informed her of my dissatisfaction. Instead of trying to alleviate my concerns, all she said was ""let me go get a manager.""  At this point, I had enough. This situation would not have escalated if our waitress had taken responsibility for her mistakes and offered us a sincere apology. The first manager that came out, a Caucasian woman, made the situation even worse. She didn't even bother to listen as I recounted our horrible experience and the nasty attitude of our waitress. All she could focus on was the fact that I had eaten a majority of the entree. I told her that I order this entree regularly, and there was significantly less shrimp than normal. After a few minutes of going back and forth with her, I really thought I was going to lose my mind. Even the manager was talking to us in such a rude manner, instead of apologizing for our ruined meal. Eventually she cut the conversation short and asked ""So, what is it that you want me to do?"" It was obvious that my concerns meant NOTHING to her and that she just wanted to shut me up at this point. I WAS HOLDING BACK TEARS AT THIS POINT because never have I, ever, been spoken to this way, at a place I chose to give my business to. At this point, I wanted this meal from hell to be over, so I told the manager there was nothing she could do for me at this point and to please just bring our check. She did not offer any ways she could alleviate my distress or come to a solution, she just said ok and left. A few minutes later, our waitress dropped our check off at our table without saying A WORD to us. There was no ""thank you for choosing to dine with us"" or ""im sorry your meal did not turn out the way you expected"" or even ""i hope you have a great night"". SHE. DID. NOT. SAY. A. WORD. This is what sent me over the edge. They were not treating us like humans at this point, much less paying customers. I took a look at the check and saw my entree on the bill, full price. When the waitress came back, I let her know I refused to pay for my meal, so she went to get the manager again. This time another manager came out, an African American male. He was much kinder than the others.He went ahead and apologized for and took the entree off our check. As we were waiting for him to bring our new check out, our waitress stood at the bar with two other waitresses. She was loudly and profanely telling them about how I ate my food and then didn't want to pay for it. I could hardly believe it. I was being accused of being a cheap liar right in front of my face. I was literally being attacked for speaking up about the unacceptable service she gave us. When the male manager returned. I informed him of what I had just witnessed. He said he did not see it, so there wasn't much he could do. On our way out, one of the waitresses called after me ""don't go out if you can't afford it."" Needless to say, I will never be returning here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=40

THE GOOD... -seated promptly -greeted by server quickly -avocado egg rolls were still good -water refilled promptly THE BAD... -this time they had root beer, but it was FLAT! C'mon that's two strikes! -food order took awhile (server never checked-in with update) -water refills were room temperature (no ice refills) -deep dish pizza lacked sauce...I looked under the cheese and it was pretty dry -mushroom topping was cut up very small  Overall I was a bit disappointed with my second visit.

I thought the happy hour food pricing was great but I feel like the drinks could've been better like I saw on the website. My friends and I started off with a beer taster, we tried 4 beers for $7.95 and it's worth it if you're not sure what you want/like. The menu is very intensive with a lot of food and alcohol options. I really enjoyed the berry cider that they have and I would recommend that. I shared the sliders with thin fries and they were ok. The burgers were seasoned really heavily, too much for my liking.

The items are huge servings and have big flavor, you are garenteed to be well fed for the amount of money you put out.  A lot of premium beers for the beer connoisseur as well as lots of great tasting mocktails and sodas straight from the tap. So even the non drinker can have a fun drinking experience.  I'm a non drinker and want to try every soda and mocktail on the menu. You will love the orange cream soda, its like drinking a slightly carbonated creamsicle.. Great atmosphere, very spacious and a clear view into the kitchen.  -Super friendly wait staff and management, even the most simple of mistakes will be corrected with kindness right away. Never have to wait on additional requests, food delivery time to the table or drink refills. Even pay your check on their app to really cut down the wait time.  I've been here twice now, very little if anything to complain about, they are so kind and welcoming. The place is great for friends to hang out at and enjoy good food at drinks. This is like a Fridays, but on a much higher level of quality.  They have everything from sandwiches, steaks, tacos, pizza, etc. etc. Everyone will find something to eat.  I love how they use matchstick fries, something unique to bring to the table because I never see them anymore. As a kid I loved having a pile of matchstick fries with my burger so it was like my inner child smiled.  I plan on being a regular here, trying as much of the menu as possible. If you plan on being a regular too, download their app for advanced seating, to go orders, bill pay, and reward points for coupons and free food. Each point is equal to one dollar spent.

Portion size is good, prices are fair, and the beer selection is great. They actually brew their own beer. The managers are nice and walk around making sure everyone is enjoying their meal, and the staff is friendly. I have been to this location maybe 6 times since it has opened. Some of my favorites are the California club flatbread, shrimp pasta, lemon thyme chicken, chicken wings...I could go on!

They never brought out our french fries and I had to call our waitress over to ask about the status of the fries. She never came over to check on us probably because we were only a group of two which I guess makes us not as important. She was not very friendly and did not take much interest in my food allergy.

Jay S.,"Baltimore, MD",0,14,,2.0,4/16/2017,"BJ's is not a place I would typically visit BUT we met a group of family and friends that wanted a local corporate restaurant. Briefly, here were my issues during our last visit: - While we had a somewhat large party (7 adults), our wait was one hour and 15 minutes. There were two 12 tops that remained empty the entire time we waited AND the entire time we ate our meal (as we left, they finally split one of the 12 tops for two families). The staff easily could have split one of the twelve tops (they obviously weren't holding it for a reservation or a walk up group). - My meal came with no sauce even though the menu listed a sauce...it was so dry and flavorless. - My meal was listed as ""spicy"" but there was no spice...nor any flavor...again, zero flavor. That said, it wasn't all bad... - The menu has lots of interesting items (but since there is no flavor to their food, it doesn't matter if there are 500 items on the menu). - Our waiter was fantastic, so maybe their focus is customer service instead of focusing on quality of the food. People who prefer corporate dining over local restaurants, places that are the same in Topeka as they are in Wilmington, will love this BJ's.

Pizza Hut tastes better... Let me explain.  I would just 1st like to start by mentioning that BJs offers "" curbside delivery "" when you are placing a carry out order.  I placed my order around 8:30pm. I was told it would be about 15-20min for my delivery. When I called and requested the curbside, no one asked for a number to reach me on, no one asked for what make and model I would be in and no one mentioned where to park for this "" curbside "" that is offered.  I ordered a medium size pepperoni and cheese  CHICAGO deep dish pizza. I called BJs back to let them know I was in the front of the restaurant parked in a valet spot, because there are no designated "" curbside "" delivery spots. When I called again, no one asked what car I would be in, I had to mention it.  Around 9pm I got irritated and walked in and asked for my pizza. It was just sitting the heated area where pizzas are dropped off. I payed my bill, walked to car and checked the pizza ( they did not open the box to check the pizza). I noticed it was a chicken and bbq pizza... Not what I ordered. So I walked back in and ask to speak with the manager because I was simply irritated at this point.  He had offered to give me a Large pepp and cheese pizza that was already in the over and remove my charge for the incorrect pizza. I said okay and asked about the curbside the restaurant offered. He only said that he would walk it out. Didn't really answer anything about curbside for me at all.  15more min later and after everything I got my pizza around 9:30... Not cool.  Got home and tried eating the pizza, but it was way too doughy... It looked done on the outside but the cooked part of the pizza peeled right off and there was the base of the pizza... Doughy. There were some kind of bruschetta tomatoes on top? Design I guess? But they were all Over the pizza. No where on the menu did it mention that.  I'll say that it might have been that they were in a rush to give me a pizza because of the error that occurred previously, but at least have some sort of pride in what you give to your customers. The pics online looks like BJs has amazing food. I was excited to try it but super let down even after the manager tried to fix it. Terrible.  Don't know if It's worth going back. The only good thing out of this was that this terrible pizza that was not eaten was free.  2 stars for BJs. Customer service was horrible, the manager tried to fix this error, but this could of all been prevented if management had a process in place for carry out food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=20

Kim B.,"Baltimore, MD",285,148,356,5.0,1/6/2017,"While visiting with my son and his family around the holidays he mentioned how much he liked BJ's so when I saw they had a ""B1G1 Free"" Entree hubby and I decided to treat our son to dinner.  We arrived at the restaurant around 5:00 and the place was still pretty empty which was fine with me.  We were seated at a table in the bar area and were immediately greeted by Ashley who explained the specials and took our drink orders.  For appetizers we went with the Calamari and Chicken Lettuce Wraps and both were quite delicious.  I've had Lettuce Wraps at several restaurants and BJ's take on one of my favorites was quite original - the chicken was mixed with spices, veggies, water chestnuts and topped with Wonton Strips and served with a Sesame Soy Sauce and a Spicy Mustard (trust me when I say make sure you have a full glass of water nearby if you have a tender tongue.  I love spicy things but my tongue was burning for a few moments).  We totally lucked out coming on a Thursday night - my son and I were in the mood for ribs and as luck would have it Thursdays is Rib Night and you cannot beat the deal they have.  For $18.95 you get a Whole Rack of Ribs, Salad, 2 Sides and a Pizookie for dessert.  Both the House and Caesar Salads were fresh and flavorful and each was enough for 2 people.  The ribs were tender and I really loved the flavor that the dry rub topped with a sweet heat bbq sauce and unlike a lot of restaurants, they don't upcharge for premium sides - I went with the Roasted Asparagus and Shoestring Fries.  The fries were hot and crispy, salted to perfection and didn't even need ketchup (which says a lot for this admitted condiment-aholic) and the Asparagus were Crispy on the outside yet tender on the inside and tasted like they had been dusted with Parmesan Cheese and I couldn't get over how large the portions were, I actually brought home half of my entire dinner.  Hubby got the Sirloin (also with the fries and asparagus as sides) and he said it was quite tasty but not the best he's ever had, he said he'd give it a B-.  We've never been the type of people who save room for dessert (we usually can't even finish our entire meals) but since the Pizookies were included in the Rib Special we made an exception and left a little wiggle room.  I chose the Monkey Bread and my son chose the Salted Caramel Pizookie, both were topped with 2 Scoops of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream (and my sons was drizzled with caramel and mini chocolate chips).  The Pizookies come out warm, right out of the oven and talk about a decadent treat.  Our entire bill for 3 meals, 2 appetizers and 3 drinks came to about $66 before the tip which is an awesome deal plus they have a Premier Diner's Club where you earn a point for every dollar spent (there's also an app where you can keep track) and you can save to redeem for money off, free items, etc.  Parking is validated in the garage attached to the movie theater so it only costs $2 and it sure beats looking for a parking space in the Towson area.  We will definitely be back, I'm looking forward to checking out the lunch specials, the Chicken Fajita Soup in particular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=20

I ordered the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon and it didn't disappoint either. And the 2 strawberry mojitos I had were perfect.  Tonight, however, the service was a little lacking.  Maybe because it was rather busy for a Thursday.  Still, overall, it's a good place to go for food, drinks and conversation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=20

We wound up just walking in close to 5 PM on a Saturday evening and got a table immediately. The hostess was very nice and explained a couple things on the menu before turning it over to our waitress. Loreal was our waitress. She seemed nice and knew what she was doing. I ordered the Ahi Poke as an appetizer. Someone from the kitchen brought that before we received our drinks or silverware. We thought we would try the beer sampler which provided four beers of your choosing in sampler glasses. Those were perfect and they even label the beer in front of each glass. For dinner the wife ordered the Seared Ahi salad and I chose the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. For the appetizer and entrée the tuna was excellent. I greatly enjoyed the chicken tacos and the dressing that was added on the side was a perfect combination. I noticed that I could download an app for my phone under this restaurant and after doing so, discovered a $10 off coupon that I could immediately use for this meal.

Are you frickin kidding? this is the solution to short lunch breaks! having your lunch waiting for you when you arrive saves at least 10 minutes.  Now the service was amazing, but that was because we had Shea as our server. I don't know if everyone that works there is as wonderful, but if you get Shea you're in for a great experience.

Decadent Pa-Zookie dessert is a treat, warm cookie with ice cream. Salted caramel, yum! Friendly and patient staff with a foodie. Alas, I've tried several dishes here, and was repeatedly disappointed. Next I'll have to try their ""enlightened entree"" options, like salmon and quinoa, but I don't like farm-raised fish.

Alana B.,"Towson, MD",0,13,,2.0,6/27/2017,"BJ's was my favorite spot for lunch during my lunch hour at work. They offered curbside pick up and lunch specials all done online. BJs curbside lunch was my routine every few weeks. It was speedy. The host was very nice and met me at my card with food.  My visit today reminded me of how cumbersome my last visit here was and I wish I would've remembered before I placed my order. Now when you arrive curbside and call the curbside number they tell you ""you gonna have to come to the bar To get your order"" .  (This happened last time too) This review is more  so to speak on the staffing .  There are two hosts at the front. A runner that brings to go orders to the bar (not sure if they're a waitress too) . The bartender is left to take to go orders, cash them out, serve drinks at the bar and tend to food orders as well. The bartender has a heavy load to carry , yet is the most pleasant of the employees out of all of the other employees that are far from busy while the bartender takes on everything.  The bartender asked the runner if she could bag my order that the runner brought out while the bartender was making a drink. The runner rolled her eyes and ignored the bartender and walked back to kitchen .  The food was good as always. But the staffing during lunch can use improvement. As a customer it feels like everyone else is sitting around not offering help and everything is on the bartender . It's upsetting to be offered curbside when it truly no longer exists at least during the week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=20
Sarah P.,"Middle River, MD",114,4,,1.0,9/3/2016,"This was probably the worst dining experience I have ever had in Towson. There are many decent local places to choose from in this area, and I really wish we would have opted for one of those.  My husband and I came in to watch college football and have dinner. We sat at the bar right in front of the game we wanted to see. I ordered the queso with chips, and the Twisted BLT salad.  My husband ordered a full rack of ribs and mashed potatoes.  Oh where to begin? The queso came out lukewarm and the chips were extremely stale. I asked them to reheat it since it was like eating coagulated velveeta.  My salad came out drenched in dressing. I don't know if the spinach was going bad and they were trying to cover it up, or if the half cup of dressing wilted the spinach. There was also no bacon on the salad. Nice BLT with no B! My hubby's mashed potatoes tasted like potato gum. Instant,  I guess. Gross. The ribs were the worst we have ever had. They had the consistency of overcooked chicken; dense and chewy with the flavor of a McRib. Also, the game we were clearly watching was turned off twice (channel change), which was remedied both times...once, ok. But twice? Weird! Beyond the terrible food was the service. Both bartenders were pleasant but not proactive at all. They never came back after the food was delivered so I didn't get a chance to tell them how bad everything was. When we told her we wanted to pay the check she then asked, ""Do you want boxes to take this home?"" I told her,  ""No, that was pretty much the worst food I ever had."" Her reply was, ""Oh! I could have gotten you something else!"" Well yeah, I guess if you had checked on us that would have been an option. She then removed just one plate of the disastrous food we left behind, instead of getting it out of my sight. It also clearly did not occur to her to be proactive enough to have a manager come talk to us. After she returned our credit card and we sat to finish our drinks for about another 20 mins, we never saw her again.

Jamie B.,"Reisterstown, MD",0,16,,1.0,10/12/2015,"This was a very disappointing dinner. I'll start my review with the food: Calamari Appetizer- Not that crispy. Included more ""rings"" than tentacles.  Sirloin steak cooked medium rare with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts: steak was not medium rare. It was more like medium with the outside very well done. Hard to explain... but it was tough. It did have a tasty rub on it though, but since it was so dry I had to ask for steak sauce. The mashed potatoes were very good but you really can't mess that up. The brussel sprouts were dry, flavorless, and luke warm.  Greek chicken wrap: My mom ordered this and while I did not try it, she said that it was not that good. The rice salad served with it was cold and she didn't like it.  Jambalaya: My dad ordered this and I did try it. I thought it had okay flavor. It had some spice. But he wasn't impressed. It had a lot of sauce and should have been served with bread. He asked for some bread, which the waiter did bring out, but he seemed kind of put off.  Pink Cadillac martini- this drink tasted very good but I felt that it had more juice than alcohol. Usually a martini is a bit stronger. This was more like a fruity mixed drink.  Service: we had come here to celebrate my mother's birthday. I told the person on the phone when I made the reservation that it was her birthday and asked if they did anything. They said yes. Well... they did nothing. It was a bit disappointing especially after the sub par food. Also I had asked the waiter if he recommended the steak, and if it was tender. He said yes. We also asked him if calamari was good, he said it was the most popular appetizer. My mother asked him if the greek chicken wrap was a good choice, and he said it was popular. Lies!

I stopped in shortly after this place opened to have a business lunch with an influential friend of mine. Other than our server, Marianna, we were honestly not impressed.  Given what she had to work with it really made our experience great. We ordered an avocado appetizer. Some sort of egg roll. I can only imagine it was frozen. The avocado was mushy and brown. My Guest got a salad and the dressing was overly sweet as was the dipping sauce for the appetizer. It was nearly a small bowl of molasses. Draft beer was good and my lunch entrée was acceptable. I mostly felt like it was any chain restaurant.

I ordered the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger, as suggested by the server. Although the burger was overcooked, it still tasted good. I also enjoyed their house drafts on tap, I would suggest the Hopstorm IPA. I would definitely return again just based on the service alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100
Chase S.,"Baltimore, MD",0,21,16,3.0,11/23/2015,"The food is great!  There is not a doubt about that, but tonight's service was terrible.  The wait for the food was long (and there is not a lot of patrons in the restaurant). One of our meals was given to another party. We never received our appetizers. I expect better from this franchise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100
Alan S.,"Owings Mills, MD",0,15,,5.0,8/10/2016,Excellent burgers. Fun vibe. A little noisy. Easy parking in garage. Food is always good. Do the beer tasting. They give you 5 or 6 small glasses of beer. Lots of fun. Wide selection of beers. Good times. Reasonably priced. Right next to the Cinemark movies.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100
Kim S.,"Reisterstown, MD",45,16,22,5.0,6/19/2015,I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this place. From the decor to the bartenders.. everything was great. I had the Fried Artichokes and the Brussel sprouts.. both were excellent. I would highly recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100
Tanisha A.,"Roanoke, VA",67,18,,5.0,11/6/2015,"Stopping here was a last minute decision when looking for late lunch/early dinner. I had read good things regarding this place on their facebook page but we wanted to be the judges for ourselves. Service was awesome, atmosphere and dining experience was awesome. I LOVE the wide variety of selections they have to choose from. Their beer and desert selection is awesome. We had a bacon cheeseburger and the ravioli. The burger had a wonderful flavor and cooked perfect for a well done burger. The ravioli was sooooo good. It had the perfect amount of meat and cheese. The only thing I will mention to the server if it happens again is that the food could have been slightly warmer when served. Aside from that we are sure we will visit again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100
Alli R.,"Mount Wolf, PA",39,42,,3.0,9/27/2015,"Visited Bj's on two occasions. Great location, but unless you know the area, parking stinks. The food was really good and I would give more stars, but the first time they were out of root beer. The second visit, the root beer was extremely flat and I couldn't drink it. The avocado rolls are fantastic. Very unique and the dipping sauce is excellent. The service was great both times as well. Although the second time, the waiter seemed to disappear at the end. I would go back because I enjoyed the food. Hopefully one day I will get to try their root beer!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100
Steve E.,"Towson, MD",0,1,,1.0,7/1/2015,"If I could give less stars I would. 3 times I've been there and 3 times I left disappointed. The first time our Bartender forgot to put in our food order and since we had a movie to catch, we weren't able to get it. Second time wings took 25+ minutes to arrive to the table and the ribs were extremely tough. We said something to the server and she didn't even acknowledge the complaint. The third and worst time we sat in the cocktail area and we stared at our drinks for 10 minutes before we had to flag our server down to get them. Again wings took extremely long and had to cancel them.  Zero stars. Terrible service for just OK food. Avoid at all costs in my opinion. Save your $$$",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100
Paulette H.,"Parkville, MD",40,1,,1.0,12/6/2015,"I don't normally write  reviews on restaurants, but this one was the worst! The service wasn't great, our waiter had no customer service skills.  When I received my food it was incorrect. I sent it back and it returned still incorrect.  They never apologize for the inconvenience.  The manager was sitting  across from us and didn't even come over to apologize.  I will not return to this establishment again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100
Barry B.,"Baltimore, MD",165,1,,1.0,1/21/2016,This is one of the worst places I've been to. First we start 35 mins before a server came. Another 25 minutes for our drinks and finally another 45 minutes for our entrees. Everyone at my table had their food and I get mine 35 minutes after they finish. This is horrible. I will never come back. The first salmon they brought was dry and over cooked and Noe this one is just as bad. I'm too thru,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100

Pete N.,"Towson, MD",0,6,,1.0,6/16/2016,"Everything seemed fine while we were there for lunch June 11, but a few hours later we were both really sick to our stomachs and it ruined our weekend.  It was the only thing we ate all day so no doubt we got food poisoning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-towson?start=100
