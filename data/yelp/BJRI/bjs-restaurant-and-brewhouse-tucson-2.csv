Ashley B.,"Tucson, AZ",0,15,2,5.0,12/22/2017,"Fish and chips are prepared well, and consistently. I've never had an issue with the quality of the fish, or on the preparation.

Diane P.,"Tucson, AZ",5,13,28,1.0,10/24/2017,"I would seriously give the Broadway location a zero if it was possible! We had the worst service and food on a Monday at lunch with friends. The server had no clue that dirty dishes should be cleared when refills of salad and soup were delivered, the glasses of soda were intentionally left at the end of the table and refills were ignored....service was slow and she only had one other table of 5 in our area. If she had other tables on the other side of the restaurant, that is just plain mismanagement. The waitress was annoying on the verge of rude, she corrected my husband several times when he asked questions and had an unpleasant attitude. A few members of our party asked to make slight changes to their orders, apparently that makes their handheld ordering system upset. She seemed very perturbed that she had to go to the kitchen to correct it. If it causes that much of an issue...maybe it's not the right system. If she thought she was being funny or making jokes, she missed the mark.  We called and had a chat with the floor manager later in the afternoon. We told him about the bad service and the unsatisfactory food. He did admit that all of the soups are very thick and for the most part, spicy. Not much chicken could be found in the the chicken tortilla soup and the chili was mostly beans. He also apologized for the lackluster service and offered a gift card. We went to retrieve the gift card, to use it at the other location on North Oracle (our favorite location.)  When we arrived the next day, 3 very nosy hostesses all wanted to know what was going on when we asked for the gift card. The floor manager was busy and kept us waiting over 15 minutes. The manager finally arrived and was able to open the office door (the floor manager had locked her keys in the office) and get the gift card for us.  North Oracle has a better management style. We have never had an issue there....it's worth the drive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2
Jamie Y.,"Tucson, AZ",49,58,25,5.0,9/24/2017,"Came to BJs for a friend's birthday with a group of 6.  The menu selection is phenomenal and so is the beer!  Tommy was our waiter and he recommended for me to try the Sonoran White Chocolate beer and their Amber. Both were delicious! And Tommy was a great waiter. We ended up calling him Big-T!  Our group was filled with laughter and probably a little noisy. But it was Sunday night football and not very crowded after we arrived.  We got a bunch of appetizers and one giant, deep dish pizza with pepperoni and bacon. Avocado egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, wings, spinach-artichoke dip, and pot stickers. Others also got some soup, tacos, and chili. We were all stuffed. We wanted to make it to dessert but we didn't haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2
Alex C.,"Tucson, AZ",38,113,90,1.0,12/18/2017,"I honestly don't understand the big attraction of this place. Maybe it's the meat or the sports games playing on big TVs? Neither things appeal to me. They have a novel of a menu and only one item clearly marked vegan, which came in a bread bowl with the top heavily buttered. My friend got a steak well done but it was pretty pink. The Brussels sprouts appetizer was so super oily it felt like taking a half shot of oil in every bite. The sweet potato fries were barely lukewarm when they arrived. The beer selection was subpar. They did have Dragoon IPA thankfully. Honestly if you want a place like this the Yard House is a few minutes away with awesome vegan options and an amazing assortment of beer. Sadly, the work Christmas party picked this place. On the upside, my food was free! Even free food though will not have me coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2

Had drinks refilled.  Made sure we were good.   The pizza was just what we wanted.  We got BJs favorite.  We had enough for lunch the next day and then some.  We would have appreciated the leftovers boxed up for us since we were at a small booth.  I heard other servers offer it.  Would have made this review a 5.

Luckily my dad warned us about one of the sauces it's basically like sticking a huge amount of wasabi in your mouth I dabbed my fork in it to taste oh woah! It's good but wil clear your sinus. Everyday they have different specials we came it was half off pizza deep dish or tavern cut my mother and I split a tavern cut which was sooood good and more than enough food for both of us.

Kevin L.,"Tucson, AZ",6,80,2,5.0,12/12/2017,"I had a large catering order for a company party and I was very impressed with the way the Saturday (Dec 9th) team handled it. A few days prior to that, I was given some confusing information so I was a bit worried about how things might turn out. The morning manager that day was very knowledgeable and got my order in quickly and reassured me that the order will be processed correctly. On pick up, the two gentlemen at the carryout station (Edgar and another friendly guy) were nice, professional, and very efficient. They showed what teamwork and leadership is all about. They also helped me carry many items to my car. Above all, this is in the midst of a very busy Saturday night. Props!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2

You can find anything you are hungry for on this menu. I didn't particularly like the avocado egg rolls but I think that's preference. They were cooked well. They just didn't make sense to my palate. I also didn't care for the sauce and I didn't feel it matched the egg rolls.

Since it was a little early to have a beer I will only give a review of the food. We each have something different I had your brand-new chicken sandwich that was being served for the first time  today and my brother had three choice selective vegetarian plate.  Since I can't eat certain foods and  certain type of condiments, I had to make some slight changes to this chicken sandwich which they had no problem with making a change. Instead of french fries I had fruit and instead of Dijon mayonnaise I just had plain Dijon mustard. My brothers three courses were couscous, carrots in garlic butter and sweet potato fries. Both were delicious and I highly recommend their food. We will be going back at night with Kathy and sampling their beers and looking at the rest of their menu to decide what other great food items we should have to eat. I noticed that they had a Irish red ale that was beer brewed on site there is one of my favorite types of ale.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2

After I left I got a phone call from the girl who had put my order together apologizing profusely that she had missed one item. I was taking the food to a business meeting and had to come back to the restaurant to get the missing food which was honestly very annoying since it cut into my time for the scheduled meeting. When I arrive, she had complimentary desert, as well as the missing item. I asked if they would be willing to provide a gift card for my inconvenience. The girl got the manger and the honored the gift card. I really had no intention of getting anyone in trouble, and I still think this location is great.

Trisdon M.,"Tucson, AZ",45,138,348,2.0,4/12/2017,"Not the best BJs I've been to I'm afraid... The bartender was very friendly as was the host staff but the food was beyond subpar. I ordered my usual BJs entrée, the Salmon Quinoa bowl, and it was incredibly bland and dry as a bone. I had to ask for a side of sauce to help me get it down. Truthfully the driest piece of fish I've had to date. I would've sent it back but I already had to send back one of my drinks. I ordered ""sangria"" without reading the menu and noting that they put fireball and cinnamon stick in theirs' (not a cinnamon fan at all). The bartender was very understanding and I ordered a replacement drink which wasn't great, but it was drinkable.  We finished the meal with a monkey bread pizookie (it was Tuesday so $3 pizookie night) and it was also dry and overcooked. Between the two of us we maybe got half of it down... Honestly the worst experience I've had at a BJs, which happens to be one of my favorite chains. The staff is great but I'd suggest additional training behind the bar and definitely in the kitchen. They seem to have a tendancy to overcook things... 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2
Christine B.,"El Paso, TX",11,180,217,3.0,3/29/2017,"BJ's is known for their numerous beers and all their TVs around the restaurant. I've heard they take reservations, but every time I meet up with a larger party with ""reservations,"" it still takes a bit of time to get seated.  I always prefer to sit in the bar area as it is open seating and service is usually faster. The menu seems to change on a regular basis, but on several occasions, I have been able to order simple items off-menu. If you can make it there for happy hour, the prices aren't too bad. There are actually decent food and drink items offered on HH that make it worth your while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2

Very crisp tasting. I ordered the chicken wings and calamari.  The calamari was a lil bland but it was a decent amount.

Pamela C.,"Tucson, AZ",3,22,61,3.0,10/27/2016,"Used to come here more often but hadn't been back in a while. We decided to dine here the other night and I was swiftly reminded why I am not really a big fan of this place. Very nice setting, modern feel, plenty of HDTV's, plenty of space yet, somehow everything feels so impersonal. Its seems like the restaurant is run so corporate, that the entire dinning experience is made to feel somewhat robotic. Cant quite put my finger on it. Even though you are greeted promptly, brought to your table with friendly gestures, and given a fair bit of attention by the servers... I never really felt like any of it was particularly sincere. Seems like everyone there is just in it for the money. I know that EVERYONE who currently holds a job is essentially ""just in it for the money"" however, when this particular ambience bleeds into the food.... we have a problem.  In my opinion the entire place feels like it has no soul, particularly the food. I'm always left feeling like I paid too much for something I did not enjoy and I hate that. Should have gone to Texas Roadhouse that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2

Corrie W.,"Tucson, AZ",45,58,15,4.0,7/29/2016,"We were thinking about going to Yard House for dinner tonight, but there was a ridiculous wait and we didn't want to sit on the patio in the rain, so we headed up the road and went to BJs. We've been there several times, the last with a small group for my husband's birthday back in November. The service is always consistent, even when they're busy, and the food is good. My favorite is the Parmesan crusted chicken with the white cheddar mashed potatoes. . it's like crack. Mmmm.  Tonight, we started with a root beer (DH) and an iced tea and water for me, and got the potato skins for a starter. Yum! We got a ton of them, and they came out hot and surprisingly fast. And they brought ranch and sour cream. Nice.  We each had burgers - the guacamole bacon for DH and the bacon burger for me. DH said the guac-bacon burger packed a bit of a kick. The bacon burger was good but not particularly memorable. The thin and crispy fries were tasty, though.  I can't remember the name of our waiter, but he was GREAT. Warm, friendly and personable, he was really a hem. He told us it was his first day, but if he hadn't mentioned it neither of us would have guessed it.

Andrew A.,"Tucson, AZ",91,101,,2.0,6/19/2016,"Once again we've landed here on restaurant chain island.  A place where the ambiance is welcoming, the menus are beautiful , and the food....well whatever. I'm not going to get into the long and short of why Tucson needs another chain restaurant like we need another Mattress Firm, but we are really coming into our own here and I just don't see how places like these are selling any food.   Nearly any night of the week you can find the parking lot at these places filled to the street with un inspired diners who likely drove right by the King Fisher and Feast to end up eating a personal pan pizza at BJs.  The problem is us.  Perhaps the inexpensive grub and shiny new brass poles lining the bar area are what the middle class American truly desires. Why just the other day I was in the middle of s conversation that had to do with whatever it is I'm ranting about.  And a young woman who I love dearly commented that she'd rather go to a Denny's than Prep and Pastry .  She knows that she will enjoy the American Slam (or whatever) at the former while she just doesn't know what she'll end up with at the latter.  Not her fault.  She will still have a positive dining experience.  But had she driven a little further, waited in line a little longer and taken a chance.....she may have had the meal of her life! Take a chance people. Life is too short to have an ok meal.  Try something new and see what we are all writing about!  There's excellence in this town....come and have lunch with us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=40

John R.,"Tucson, AZ",21,154,,4.0,2/26/2016,"This place has grown on me much like a benign tumor.  I didn't care for it at first, but after a while, you accept it  and realize it isn't worth getting rid of it. Their menu is broad and vast.  Some items better than others.  For instance: - The steaks, though slightly salty (which I like) are really decent and lean - The chili, which many people seem to like, I thought could use some spices and more flavor - The bread bowls are a great concept and good value but, again, take some of the salt from the steak and put it in your soups and chili - The homemade sodas are a big hit, I think these are the coolest (literally, served in an icy mug) - The pazookies are tremendous - I think it's worth it just coming for dessert to get a homemade soda and a pazookie The service is a mixed bag.  I've had good 2/3ds of the time, but when it's bad, it is cardboard and forgetful.  When it's good, it is timely and friendly. What is a 5 of 5 is the ambience.  It's a touch of Great Gatsby meets sports lounge.  The restrooms are super chic and clean as well.  I like the gigantic revolving door as well when you enter. Perhaps the brightest point - I haven't had bad hostess situations here.  Truly remarkable in a town notorious for crappy hostesses.  They've got this dialed in.

Karen M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,8,,2.0,6/30/2017,"It's hit or miss. Overall I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could.  Tonight was a miss.  I had tomato bisque, and shrimp  and asparagus penne.  I was pleased that bj's is putting calorie counts on the menu, and then totally puzzled.  A ""bowl"" of soup that's about 10 spoonfuls spread on a shallow plate is 560 calories, while a plate of pasta enough for two, plus a roll, has 730?  Yes, the soup was greasy - in a really, really tasty way, I have to admit -  but if 560 calories is correct, I was basically drinking oil with some tomato sauce mixed in; normal tomato soup is about 150 calories a cup.  That might be right, I could actually see flecks of oil separating from the soup, but I bet it could have been made with a bit more flavor and less fat, for $7 is should have been.  OTOH, the penne was ridiculously under-estimated, there was at least half a pound of pasta on that plate, I'd estimate 1000 calories, maybe more, not including the sauce or the roll.   In addition to being unable to rely on the nutritional information given, the penne was seriously bleh.  It was overcooked, there was a soggy rogue crouton hiding in it, and when I pay $16.50 for a plate of ""shrimp pasta"", I'd like to see more than five. My husband had the ribs and was unimpressed - again, it's hit or miss, the last time they were very good\, this time dry and not meaty.  And his tortilla soup had a big lump of potato in it - not horrible, but not supposed to be there either. Finally, our friends had a coupon for a free meal that the waiter forgot to add in, and it took nearly 20 minutes to get it sorted out and corrected.  My take-away:  don't go on a busy night, don't count on the calorie count, and (from another visit) definitely don't order take-away, the portions are smaller and inconsistent, and the food may be sitting there for hours or not ready when you arrive, regardless of lead time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=40

Oh I forgot we went there for onion rings and they don't serve them. Fries were great, service ok, $40 for two burgers with dry bread is $40 too much. Food should be fresh. No excuses accepted.  Tried it again. Some of what we ordered was ok some was not. Asparagus was way too thick, tough and undercooked. Chicken was only warm, plate was warm only. Overall food was just ok. Service ok. Nothing special about the food here.  Went for Sunday brunch a few days ago. I got a black and blue burger. The wife had cheery glazed salmon. Hers was very nice although the portion of salmon was small. My burger was so small I thought they brought me a slider. Bun was cold again and not grilled or toasted.  Quality overall was good. Taste was outstanding. Service was good but we had to ask for silverware. Quantity of food overall was not good however. And the overall price without drinks was $45. Too much for just 2 people.

Tried Smores pizookie, DELICIOUS. Toasted marshmallows on top added the right amount of gentle crisp and slight bitterness of the toasted part. Peanut butter cookie and chocolate bottom were just amazing. I'd definitely go back for that. Thank you BJs for creating it.  Service, for a Monday night, sub par.

And to speak of my micro mini pizza for 1295 you would think that it would've been enough to share between two people it was actually the size of a Pizza Hut personal pizza and not as good as a Pizza Hut pizza either and I don't care for Pizza Hut too much so that speaks volumes. My friend opted for their hot wings 1395 you think you would get a lot I believe you got eight wings he asked for them to be super spicy which is the only reason why I gave them two stars because they did provide him with super hot wings but you are lukewarm he ate them because he was hungry, do I plan to return to the establishment in the future not anytime soon, and if so I think I'll try the one on Oracle I've had better luck with their food and drinks at that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=20

The down side of 4 stars is my Sriracha chicken mac and cheese didn't pack as much heat as it probably should have, it was lightly portioned for a dinner Hardy meal, and the service was mediocre- but for a fast place to eat at 10pm after a long day BJs is an easy go-to.

During my most recent visit, I had chicken limone on angel hair pasta, which was a full-price item, but it appeared very small for the price.

Our entrees showed up, I had the New Orleans Jambalaya with chicken, shrimp and andouille  sausage and it was overly spiced, not too hot but, just way too many competing spices, it was a very confusing experience for my palate. Plus, there was about 3 bite sized  pieces of andouille sausage in the whole meal. That was just weird. The ratio of chicken and shrimp to sausage was just so off that it ruined the whole meal. My hubby had the rib eye steak and we had to ask for steak sauce because it tasted like plastic. My partner is a true carnivore so, for him to leave a half eaten steak on his plate, well, it just says it all.  The waitress was very good with filling our beverages when we needed.

At my latest trip to BJ's, I met up with a group of about 10.  When the last 3 of us arrived, there wasn't enough room for us at the table (awkwaaaaard) so the server said we could adjoin our table with the empty one next to us...but then walked away.  There was another server standing by this coveted table, but she wasn't moving it, so a couple people in our party got up to help.  However, she then said she needed that table for another party. (clearly, there was some sort of miscommunication between her and the server who told us we could use it).  But alas, after standing around awkwardly for about 5 minutes, she said we could have the table and she'd set the other party up elsewhere.  The food and drink is almost as spectacular as our entrance that night, but not quite. I will say the coconut on the Thai Shrimp Wraps is a delectable surprise! But my Chicken Club sandwich and fries was simply mehhh. My boyfriend and one of our other friends had a beer flight and I was super impressed that the server could just look at the beers and tell what they were! However, the Hopstorm IPA wasn't my cup of tea.  The IPA flavor (that is a TERRIBLE way to describe beer, I know)  I hoped and dreamed for just wasn't there.

The UA had lost against UCLA in the PAC-12 championship just moments before so the packed house started to clear a bit.  Our party of 5 stayed with the beer menu and sandwiches/burgers. My french dip was just ok. Not exactly piled high with beef and the horseradish served along with it was B.O.R.I.N.G. No spice or flavor to it at all. I enjoy stouts and porters but found the Tatonka Stout to be too smooth and lacking in any flavor on my palate.

When it came out I was away from the table. I came back and looked a the meal and it looked terrible. It was covered in Chili Verde and I couldn't even see any burger meat. The waitress (who was very nice) was busy and didn't come back for awhile. Several servers passed the table and could see that I wasn't eating the meal and didn't say anything. I attempted to get ahold of a manager and they didn't come over. When the waitress came back I showed her the burger. I told her that this wasn't how I asked for and she said I did ask for it the other way. She asked if I wanted something else but my family was almost done so I said no.

The food is decent--think upscale Applebee's or Cheesecake Factory's slightly hipper, more expensive cousin.  For the price paid, I haven't left thinking I got a good deal or that the quality of the food matched the price I've paid.

Kyle S.,"Tucson, AZ",2,92,,2.0,3/14/2014,"Haiku review: Meat with side of meat. A more upscale Applebees. Crappy in-house brews. The folks call me and ask if me and the special lady friend want to get dinner with them before they go to Las Vegas to and visit my Idiot brother. Well long story short we end up here.  I honestly haven't any idea if they had to wait as when we arrived they had mostly killed the appetizers. Which, DaFuq is with serving a horseradish sauce with lettuce wraps sure they call it a spicy mustard sauce but who are you fooling it isn't even yellow? There also were some fried artichoke hearts which were good but in the lower third of fried artichoke bits I have managed to shove in my mouth throughout my travels. The sauce was like someone mixed 1 part lemon juice to 2-3 parts ranch... but the super overcooked piece of fried calamari hiding amongst the crispy plant matter was a real wake up to my pallet. Its flavor really complimented its bicycle inner tube-esque texture. Now I will never claim to never eat animal bits but, Jesus Tap Dancing Christ there are only TWO vegetarian options and absolutely no viable vegan options. Your choices are a veggie pizza or some pasta with a very mediocre red sauce.  So I finally decided on a turkey club after I realized everyones hunger filled eyes were digging into me after the 5th lap thru the menu looking for something that I would both  eat and try to enjoy. The turkey club was a middle of the road club sandwich that would have been worse had I not added avocado. There is way too much bacon and turkey to get any kind of balance of flavors. The skinny fries were fine. Special lady friend at least found a scallop tomato asparagus dish that didn't have any red flags of allergy warnings (deathly allergic to quinoa) when it arrived it was fine not horrible not exceptional just fine. However it was along the lines of thats it?. Mom and Dad both got the honey crisp salads, apparently this is their go to dish at this place. I also feel I need to point out that this place has service problems drinks taking forever to refill, a five min gap between dishes arriving at the table, not bringing the salad dressing. Bottom line: I can honestly say that unless the goal is to go out with friends/coworkers/acquaintances for some lackluster beers I will not return, sorry Mom and Dad we will not join you at BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=100

I ordered the portobello mushroom burger veg style which comes with three pieces of portobello instead of burger patty. My fiancé ordered the chicken broccoli and Alfredo stuffed potato.

Everything was so delicious and piping hot! I would absolutely come back for this again.

Kate H.,"Tucson, AZ",2,28,1,2.0,11/13/2012,"My mother mentioned to me that she heard BJ's was an excellent chain so we decided to go here for my birthday a few days ago. I'm not really one to try new places but my family can be rather picky so we chose this place because of their huge array of choices. I definitely should have looked at the reviews on here before coming. The waiting time between ordering and receiving food was absolutely, unbelievably bad. After reading the reviews here I guess it must be a common problem but I was astonished it took nearly TWO hours to be seated, order, receive the food and then order and receive a small dessert. There is definitely a huge disconnect between the kitchen and the waiters; although our waiter was very friendly and almost a little too outgoing after the 5th ""Oh, it'll be a few more minutes!"" it gets old. Oh, and sorry BJ's, but  it does NOT take more than half an hour to put two cookies in a metal pan, heat them up, and put some ice cream on top of them. When we had received our food it was sub-par at best; hamburgers and their buns were overcooked, angel hair pasta was a ball of dough (God bless my family who ate it, I tried it and nearly spit it out) because it was overcooked, the chicken burnt in spots, etc. I could go on but I was so disappointed with this place we had to talk to the manager and explain that there really is no excuse for this kind of service. Whatever manager was working that night definitely went out of his way though since he refunded my entire party of six's meals, all drinks, and two appetizers. Because of that I'm bumping this place up to two-stars but honestly it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time.

Kate H.,"Tucson, AZ",69,10,,5.0,5/17/2014,"Atmosphere: A Food: A Service: A+ This was my family's first time eating at a BJ's.  My 5-year-old got a certificate from his school that was good for a free kid's meal, so we decided to check it out. What other reviewers have said about this being Cheesecake Factory-esque is true, except that it feels a lot more laid back.  The lunch menu looked pretty solid, but we were there on a Saturday, so no lunch for us! My husband and I and our two kids had a great meal.  Service was phenomenal, despite the fact that we were seated next to a large party who arrived just a bit before we did (usually death for service).  For example, my husband got the bottomless homemade root beer but mentioned to the waiter that he'd want a cream soda for the next round.  Fast forward 15 minutes when he was nearing the bottom of his mug, and the waiter brought over a fresh mug and was setting it down on the table pretty much at the exact moment that he finished! Our kids' food arrived a couple of minutes before ours, which I always love.  It wasn't like 5 minutes before, it was really probably about 90 seconds--just enough time to get them both set up with ketchup and get the crayons and kids menus gathered up so that we were ready to dig straight into our food when it arrived.  (Speaking of which--from the time we placed our order to the time the food arrived?  About ten minutes.  Nice work, kitchen!) But the best part was when, near the end of the meal, we presented the manager with our son's coupon.  He (our son) was so darn excited about it, and the manager brought him a little BJ's pin to wear, told him how great it was, and then comp'd not only his meal, but also his brother's, and a dessert for the table!  My son was so proud of himself coming out of that restaurant that he could not stop showing off his new pin the whole drive home.  As we were getting ready to leave, the waiter came back with to-go cups filled with another round of their homemade sodas. The food was yummy, the atmosphere was fun, but the little thoughtful extras like having the manager personally congratulate my son for his big achievement (he's a developmentally delayed child who met several language goals at school this year), the kids' food, the refills, the to-go cups, and comping not just the one kid's meal, but two (plus a dessert!) left me so impressed I pretty much came straight home to crank out this review.  We will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=140
Julia S.,"San Jose, CA",164,289,148,4.0,6/8/2012,"(+) - santa fe salad - steak (rib eye?) (-) - red velvet pizookie I always wondered why all the other restaurants are so empty for dinner, it's cause everyone is at BJ's! Both times I came here for dinner there were tons of people (but still plenty of tables so no wait) 1st time here I got the Santa Fe salad which was amazing! I was scarred from the shitty salad I got at Chili's so I was expecting the worst but it turned out to be extremely delicious. Everything was fresh and the chicken tasted great, loved the seasoning.  2nd time I got some kind of steak with a side of vegetables. Steak was surprisingly good, and at a decent price.

Jean B.,"Tucson, AZ",1,3,,2.0,8/22/2012,"We ate here on a whim for an early dinner.  I've had BJ's before in another city and it was good.  Unfortunately, today's meal was mediocre at best.  We were seated after a short wait, which wouldn't have been bad, except that there were plenty of open tables.  Our waitress was decent, but not helpful when the food didn't turn out good. We waited over 30 minutes for our food, and the manager even came out and told us he knew it was taking a while, but didn't offer anything to address the issue, such as a small appetizer, salad or even just bread.  Even the kids in the booth behind us, screaming for their food, didn't tip them off that they should do something to help all the customers. I ordered the Tuscan Chicken Limone and it was underwhelming.  It had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time, the cooked spinach was dried out on top and when I showed it to the waitress, she just brought out a new plate of UNCOOKED spinach.  The pasta was also dried out from sitting too long. My companion ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and it was fried to the point of being chewy and tough.  The ""white cheddar mashed potatoes"" tasted as if they were made from an instant mix. Finally we ordered a the Red Velvet Pizzookie.  The cookie tasted more like raw cake batter with a few white chocolate chips.  The ice cream was bland.  We ended up not even eating half of it. Despite all the issues with the food, which they were clearly aware of, they didn't offer any discount or compensation, so we ended up paying over $50 for a boring and tasteless dinner.  We will definitely not being coming back here for any meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=140

Colin G.,"Marina, CA",29,376,12,1.0,5/23/2011,"I guess that, after BJ's opened up their first location here, thus bringing the official beer index in town down a few notches, they said to themselves, ""How can we make it even more mediocre?"" And, voila: BJ's on Broadway. Cards on the table: I was really pissed off that they demolished the old El Paso BBQ place and built a whole new building. Not that I loved the architecture of that place or anything, but I'm all about reusing space and all against unnecessarily wasting materials and filling our local landfills up with the stuff that didn't happen to fit BJ's facade branding requirements. I was pushed to decide on where I wanted to go for a birthday dinner and, I don't know what possessed me, but I thought this would be a good option: it was close to who we were meeting, they have a full menu and they have beer. Now, I know better than to think of this as good beer and had no illusions of it being so before coming but, from what I've had at the northern location, this one's beer just sucks. It may be that, for a time, they were brewing the beer for the first location in Chandler and trucking it down, so maybe I had had that. After all, I'm not exactly a regular at the Oracle one. So, yeah, the house beer sucks. Fine. But why does the food have to be so mediocre? I mean, it's like if Mc Donald's opened a restaurant: it's not spit-on-your-hand bad, but it's the sort of food that makes you look up after that first bite, regretting what you ordered, looking at others and trying to scratch out some food envy and mark out who you want to try to share with. But no one's happy. And so it was. The food sucks too. But then the service sucks. I swear I recalled our waiter from a car dealership years ago (no, seriously) but maybe it was just my perception of the whole spiel. That's my general issue with service at chain restaurants: it's friendly, but slow and disingenuous. I mean, they don't give a shit that you're in there, and I can understand and even respect that. The manager is the only one who cares, but he or she will be in another job within a year. But, yeah, my birthday dinner... Luckily, we had had a ""real"" birthday dinner prior to this that was satisfying, intimate and delicious, so I wasn't devastated. But I can't really explain why I came here. I can only implore you, the Yelp reader, to not repeat my mistake. Eventually places like this, who are attempting to cash in on ""craft"" beer by thoroughly bastardizing and standardizing it, will close and something much better will emerge. Until then, don't support the Rock Bottoms, Rams, Gordon Biersch's, Granite City's, and BJ's of the world. You may not like every beer at the local places, but that's actually a good thing, as they're not trying to be safe but, instead, creative and ingenuitous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=160

Aaron G.,"Monterey, CA",106,53,6,2.0,5/14/2011,"This location for BJ's has given me a few good laughs since it opened. The first time I went here, the service was the single worst thing I've experienced in my life at an established chain restaurant. Food was old, stale, sitting under a heat lamp and dried out until tasteless. And their servers were incompetent at best, weren't even familiar with their own beer menu (They tried to tell me they didn't carry Rogue's Dead Guy Ale, even after I pointed it out to them on their menu, took a manager to finally figure out that they did carry it).  This time around the service got a lot better, but I keep feeling like my food is sitting under a heat lamp for a half hour before it comes to me. I think it was the fact that my Sante Fe Spring Rolls were lukewarm when they arrived, kind of gross.  I think the funniest thing that happened to me was this last time I was there: I ordered a Union Jack IPA (mainly because their indigenous beer menu is OK at best) and 10 minutes later, some random waitress comes up to our table and says ""Who ordered the Union Jack?""  I raised my hand, then she attempts to hand me what appears to be a screwdriver or some other type of orange juice based cocktail. I said ""no, no, I ordered the Union Jack IPA""  She said ""Wait, what did you order?""  ""Union Jack IPA"" (then looks confused and again attempts to hand me the cocktail)  ""No, I ordered a beer...that is definitely not a beer""  (Walks away without a word)  About 20 minutes later, after I actually got the beer I ordered, I still see this waitress walking around the restaurant with the same drink in hand, trying desperately to pawn this thing off on someone. It was so sad, I couldn't be upset, so I just laughed.  I guess the point I'm trying to make here is, go to the other Tucson location of BJ's, they actually know what the hell they're doing there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=220

Susan R.,"Minneapolis, MN",74,74,6,1.0,3/10/2011,"First off it's lame that you can't have happy hour prices if you're not in the bar. I'm sitting a couple of feet from the bar, but I have to pay more...not cool. My husband had their Tatonka Stout which was putrid and my Oasis Amber was flat. They give the impression their beers are brewed on site, but I see now according to their site it's not. Why even call it a brewhouse if nothing is brewed in house? We decided to overlook the beer situation and order, we heard the pizza was pretty good so we ordered a deep dish pizza. We choose NOT to order their spinach & artichoke pizza because it had cream cheese on it which didn't sound too appetizing, so we decided to make our own and choose the three topping version with artichokes, spinach & red pepper. When the pizza came it had tomatoes on it. I asked the girl who served it to us why did the pizza come out with tomatoes instead of red pepper? She quickly said that ""tomatoes come standard on all pizzas"" and quickly rushed off. We started eating and realized that the pizza had cream cheese on it. Our server, Diego came back to see how things were and we him that we thought their kitchen made a mistake. He said that when you order spinach & artichokes they spread their spinach & artichoke dip on the pizza! We assumed that we would be getting fresh ingredients on our pizza, seriously WHO puts dip on a pizza!?! At this point the missing red peppers were the least of our concern. We should have known it wouldn't be good when the menu states their deep dish pizza is ready in 15 minutes. The pizza was barely cooked & I could touch the deep dish pan after it had been served. Real deep dish pizza pans usually can't be touched until AFTER dinner. So in a nutshell their deep dish pizza is warmed pre-made crap.  Our server knew we weren't happy with our meal, but there was little sympathy and no offering to make it up to us. After having the worst deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life I can easily say with out a doubt that I will never go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=220

Our server, Clinton, did a wonderful job serving, was very upbeat and made the experience even better. The only thing that was not top notch was that my dad's entrée came out and it wasn't very hot. He mentioned it as more of an afterthought to Clinton as he liked the dish it just wasn't very hot. Clinton had the manager come over and between Clinton and the manager they more than made everything right by bringing free dessert to try.

I've been many times to try different things - sandwiches, burgers, baked potatoes, fish tacos, etc. Once upon a time I thought I hit a winner with the fish tacos, but as of late they've had that not-so-fresh fishy taste. I can't say I've ever had anything yucky. It's just not yummy. Nothing memorable that draws me back. The one redeeming product is their Berry Burst hard cider. It is pretty tasty. I also have friends who like the beer. Alcohol is really the only reason we come anymore. Even so, food and drinks are way overpriced for the quality.

It was dinnertime and the place was quite busy, but I went to the TOGO register where I was greeted cheerfully by Jonathan. He was friendly and knowledgeable about celiac's and gluten. I ordered the pizza then went to sit at the bar for a drink. The barkeep was NOT gluten savvy & made little to no attempt to locate a safe beverage for me. I assured her I'd had some sort of house cider (gf) every time I visited. Nope. Wasn't happening. I moved back to the seat in the TOGO area. Jonathan, after hearing my certainty about a GF house cider, went on a quest for info. Several employees were asked but with no favorable results. That wasn't going to stop Jonathan though. Going well beyond the call of duty, he discovered indeed the house cider WAS gf! In fact, while I wasn't too psyched about having redbridge beer, the choice of 2 house ciders was problem solved. And oooohhhhh it was yummy. It was unfortunate it took so long for a drink to be placed in front of me, because my pizza was ready LONG before I was finished with the cider. The pizza was wonderful (as always)... and Jonathan was amazing, friendly, polite and literally my hero. BJ, give that man a raise! Then clone him! Spectacular!

As you can imagine, the place was pretty busy. We are greeted in short order by a server but we have to tell her we are not ready yet.

Tip: try the Ska Imperial Pale Ale, but only one. Their pretty strong... even for me.  To go with our drinks we also order Artichoke Dip to munch on. The drinks arrive and we sip, chat and people watch while we wait for our food to come out. The dip arrives. I take my first bite. It's ICE COLD in the middle. We inform the server and she is mortified. She immediately takes it back to the kitchen. I will give credit here. When she brought it back to us, it seemed we got a fresh dish and the other one was not just reheated. After all this, the dip is just OK. It tastes strongly of cream cheese and I don't find much artichoke. I liked my beer choice and my wife says her margarita is ""fine"". Chains are, if nothing else, consistent, but BJ's fell down on this visit. Three stars puts this place more in line with where it ought to be... at least in my rating system.

Terence L.,"Tucson, AZ",5,34,1,1.0,9/23/2010,"BJ's kind of blows...   Or sucks depending on your perspective/preference.  I haven't been to a BJ's in years, and I probably should have kept it that way.  When the first one opened up on Oracle, I recall a conversation with a friend about why anyone would name a restaurant BJ's.  For those of you with virginal minds, BJ is in fact acronym for a sexual act of an oral variety.  Hence my aforementioned preposition that BJ's sucks.  Why would I apply such an unseemly metaphor in my assertion?   Because it does.  I went this past Saturday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  It happened to coincide with the Wildcat's big football game against Iowa, so the cavernous and sparkling brand-new building was packed.  Indeed, everything in the place was gleaming, (including my food).  I think the place is a little bit over a month old.  Oh, they have a freaking revolving door.  Who in the hell puts a revolving door in front of a restaurant?  I should have revolved my ass right on out the second I walked into that door.  Alas, I could never leave my friend hanging on her birthday.  *sigh* Our server was nice and friendly enough, but the service overall was somewhat tepid in the efficiency department.  Granted, however, our party numbered ten and the place was pretty crazy with the game and all.  But the check-in periods from our server at our table seemed entirely too long.  Here's an idea of how it went:  five or more minutes from ordering my beer to it arriving at my table, 10-15 minutes from having our appetizer brought out to having our server take our entree order, 15+ minutes from two in my party  to have to order another drink.   Now onto my food.  I ordered the Miso Salmon.  Yeah I know, why order fish from a chain restaurant?  And in the middle of the desert of all places?  For some reason, the description of it in the menu struck my fancy.  Anyway, how do express in words how I thought of this dish?  Well, let's begin with its appearance.  In my 30+ reviews on Yelp, I cannot recall if I've ever written in any length about how a dish looked like.  I feel absolutely compelled to so at this time.  It's hard to describe, but the best I can do is just to say that the Miso Salmon looked oddly fake.  The color and sheen of it threw me off the second the plate hit the table.   It kind of resembled those plastic display-model dishes of food you see at Japanese restaurants, like at Yoshimatsu.  All of the dishes at BJ's, judging by my friends' orders, were arranged in almost perfect beauty.  My dish looked pretty as well, with the vegetables strewn around the salmon in perfect harmony, which itself was on top of a bed of rice.  While visually appealing in artistic terms, it just didn't look real.  Put another way, it looked quite artificial.   Perhaps the cook's training at BJ's is focused on the visual arts rather than the culinary arts.  Perhaps the beauty is an illusion cast upon diners to mask its substance.  Speaking of which, the Miso Salmon was certainly edible, but enjoyable it was not.  I might have liked the dish if it weren't for the fact that the fish might have been a day past its optimal freshness.  Indeed, I think some my pickup lines were fresher than my fish at BJ's.  And if you're a single woman residing in the Tucson-area, you know that's not a good thing.  The miso sauce that the salmon was prepared in was not too bad, which is a shame that fish forced me to assign one rather than perhaps two stars.  The beer wasn't bad, but it wasn't orgasmically memorable either.  Remember that Brewhouse is part of this place's name.   To end this review, allow me to elaborate on the price:  it's as high or higher than Paris Hilton on cocaine.  If one were to order what I did that night, three pints of brew, one piece of appetizer, and entree of Miso Salmon, one would be set back in excess of $40.   Throw in tip for the two-hour long service, and one can expect to drop a cool Ulysses S. Grant. If it weren't for the fact that I was celebrating a friend's birthday that night, methinks that it would have been better spent if I someone at BJ's repeatedly punched me in the stomach till I puked and then took my wallet, as empty as it normally is.  Okay, so I never vomited from eating there, and I was able to keep my wallet (minus the cash), so that's probably hitting below the belt of BJ's. Did I ever mention what BJ stands for?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=200
Peg P.,"Tucson, AZ",63,442,976,4.0,9/7/2010,"Our first visit to this new BJ's and we left safisfied and full of good food. This one will definitely go on our list of frequently visted restaurants. I had the turkey club sandwich with slender fries ($9.95) and it was prepared perfectly and was presented in generous portions and nice and warm. My friend had the Field of Greens Salad ($9.95) with balsamic vinegar dressing on the side and a glass of light Switch Lager ($3.00). The salad had a great variety of greens along with pimento, glazed pecans, and fresh fetta cheese (the only way to have fetta!), all presented attractively in a heart-shaped white dish. It was very filling, very generous in size, and was enjoyed as a complete meal.  The restaurant, around noon, was chocked full of people of all ages and while it had the hum of a busy and happy crowd of folks enjoying lunch, it was relaxing and easy to just be there. Lots of TVs on the wall for sports viewing. Large areas that could easily accommodate banquets or large  groups. Outdoor eating is available as well as a web-generated pick-up service. If you order from their lunch menu, which we did not, you can bring down the price of your meal, of course.

She was chatting with the table next to us and completely ignored us. Finally the manager came over and told us that the deep-dish pizza my sister ordered was backing up our whole order because they had too many orders in the kitchen for the pizza station. So, they brought out the rest of our food and my mom's chicken was cold, my fiance never received his wedge salad and had the wrong fries, and my brother's flat-bread pizza was cold.  Although the manager offered us free dessert and to not charge us for my sister's pizza, we wanted to leave ASAP since by the time we were done with dinner we had been there for about 2 hours and 45 minutes. Our server checked on the table next to us, then ignored us, so we caught the manger's eye again and asked for our check. After we paid the bill, our server didn't say a word when dropping off the final receipt even though my brother said ""thank you"". Never ever in my life had I had such horrible service.

Chris F.,"Tucson, AZ",20,9,,3.0,8/20/2010,"This week's search for a bi-weekly ""board meeting"" arena in south central Tucson took us to the newest BJ's location. Even though it was over 100 outside, we opted to sit out on the patio for immediate seating. It turned out to be a great choice as the shade and misters outside offered ample protection from the elements. The woman who seated us was pleasant and even ran down the daily specials for us. Soon after, the waiter arrived (ran down the specials again) and took drink orders. I opted to go with the hand-crafted orange cream soda for three main reasons: (1) I like just about anything orange, (2) I like creamsicles, and (3) I couldn't order a beer in the middle of a work day. Regardless, the color and taste of the beverage did not disappoint (nor did the free refills!) For lunch, my two companions order the unlimited soup and salad combo. According to them, the house salads left something to be desired, but the soups were hearty and tasty. I opted for the ceasar salad and half grilled chicken sandwich. The ceasar salad easily met my expectations with creamy dressing and croûtons that were neither too hard nor too soggy. The sandwich was pleasant with a nice variety of veggies and sauce that added a little spice. The wedge cut fries were delicious. Overall, BJ's is getting a less than stellar review from me due to the less than attentive service. I can assure you, though, that it would have been significantly lower if I had ordered unlimited food. My companions were only offered a new selection once (pathetic in my eyes). This could have been due to the lunch time rush, but it affected my enjoyment nevertheless. I actually look forward to returning, however, and sampling all that their extensive beer menu has to offer. If it's anything like the orange cream soda, I know I'll be pleased with my decision to attend this brewery on an off-work-hours beer journey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=200

We watched the UA game - they have a huge screen and many TVs around the restaurant. We enjoyed the food and casual atmosphere - we will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=60
Kelly L.,"Tucson, AZ",65,365,98,3.0,1/3/2015,"decent for a chain restaurant.  like many, the menu is too large and it gets annoying to try to read through the 20 pages to decide on what to eat.  They do have a smaller portion/lower cal menu which was great - made selection easier since this menu only has a handful of options.  I had the shrimp tacos from this menu and really enjoyed them.  I was full when done but not overly so, which was perfect. There was a wait (there usually is) and a hostess brought around small slices of pizza for everyone waiting which I thought was really nice  of them.  They have those buzzy things that they give you to know when your table is ready.  They said the wait would be about 20 minutes for a table for 2 and they were right - it buzzed me right at 20 minutes.  The service staff was really friendly and kept our drinks filled throughout the meal.  The seating is spread out enough that you don't feel like you're hearing everyone elses conversations and they have plenty of TV's around the room to occupy you if you run out of things to talk about with your dinner companion :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=60
Halley K.,"Tucson, AZ",7,41,9,4.0,6/27/2016,"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile , and this weekend I finally have ! Walking in, you can tell it's kind of fancy. Its beautiful to say the least. My friend and I ordered the peach sunset tea, and I honestly thought it would taste better. It had a strong unappealing after taste even with a bunch of sweetener. We ordered the spinach mushroom appatiser and oh my goodness.. That stuff is amazing. For our meals my friend ordered the chicken Alfredo noodle plate and I ordered the deep dish ravioli. Food came out quick, and hot. Both our meals were great and hearty. We could only eat half and take the rest home because we were already full! I would definitely eat here again. Probably just not as much as I'd like because it is pretty expensive; for just my friend and I our bill was like 42$.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=60

Brianne H.,"Vail, AZ",17,52,39,4.0,2/13/2016,"BJ's has a fantastic happy hour. It's the number one reason I come here. Not only does it run until 7, but they give a 50% discount on all appetizers, flatbreads, and mini pizzas. There's a lot of items to choose from. They also have beer specials. Sure they're a chain brewery, but their beer is still very good. I'm a fan of the blonde. My husband likes the pale and the red. Some of the seasonals are also great.  I've never gotten a table from the hostess and ordered a full dinner, so I can't review that part of their food and service. When I come here I always sit in the bar area and order an appetizer or two for a small dinner. The bar area (including the tables) is open seating, and it's usually easy to find somewhere to sit. Service is usually fast. My favorite app is the avocado egg rolls (which don't actually contain eggs). The sweet tamarind dipping sauce sets them off perfectly. I'm also a big fan of the potato skins. The mini Pepperoni Extreme is also great.  Parking can be a bit of a challenge at dinner time, but there are plenty of spaces farther away if you're willing to walk. It's conveniently located in the central east side. I'll keep stopping here when I'm in the area!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=60
Mark G.,"Tucson, AZ",7,23,33,5.0,2/21/2016,"Not often do you go to an established lunch and dinner place and say let's try brunch but hands down one of the best in the city for brunch. The pancakes, the french toast and the potatoes were all so tasty and don't forget the 4.00 dollar mimosa. Great food and service and because they don't tell the world they do brunch its not rushed or over packed but they will get to that one day I'm sure of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=60

Erik G.,"Huachuca City, AZ",0,7,,2.0,9/20/2016,"The restaurant is really nice. Great atmosphere!  Unfortunately, their food is disappointing. I've been there four times now. I've been unsatisfied three out of the four times. The only thing I did like was soup, and who knows what can they get got that out of. Worst of all is the food is way over priced.  My check is contributing to the rent for prime location, and the black button up shirts the staff wears.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=60

Kim C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,4,,1.0,10/16/2016,"Don't ever be a call ahead during the day. Night staff- amazing. Large party after a charity walk- all servers btw. Our two servers acted annoyed from the beginning. Tried to order from the server taking my friends order next to me, was told the other server was my server so he couldn't take my order. Cut to the end- every time any one asks for anything it seems to pain the servers- water, drink refills, etc. then my debit card goes missing and the server asks me to ask my fellow guests because ""they must have taken it because I don't have it""... talked to the super sweet manager after coming back- but I've never been given so much attitude from servers in my life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=60
William B.,"Tucson, AZ",172,732,203,4.0,6/8/2014,"BJ's is one of those places I never think about going to, but when I drive by I'm like ""Hey let's go."" It's a strange place which seems to cater to a large senior/military crowd (at this location at least, since it's not far from the base) and offers discounts and some kind of loyalty program.  The service seems fine, as this is the third time I've been to this particular location. You are greeted and seated and set up with stuff. None of it is fantastic by any means but not bad in any way. The lunch specials are quite a deal. I came away full from a caesar salad and half a classic turkey sandwich with some wedge fries. Very tasty. In the past I've had the half flatbread pizza and liked that too. I've never had drinks at this location, just water or tea, but they do make good beers at the other BJ's.  There are places I'd much rather go in town but this one seems predictable and quality and that works for me- you know what you're going to get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=60

To be healthy, I ordered the kale and brussels sprouts salad (add chicken). Can you squeeze a little more sugar into a salad? Seriously. Blueberries, grapes, dried cranberries, sugared pecans, and strawberry vinaigrette. Hardly any chicken to be found. Or Brussels sprouts. I really wanted a healthy option, but this kinda sucked.  Ok, whatever, what do you expect from a chain restaurant? The service was awkward. Bill dropped before plates cleared (personal peeve).

Darin O.,"Tucson, AZ",0,7,4,1.0,1/8/2017,"Well, this was my FIRST TIME at BJ's, and honestly could not have been MORE disappointed.  We went on Saturday night after a matinee movie, and it was fairly full....I am sure due to the football games on.  However, we decided to sit in the bar area, as to avoid the wait for a table.  Yes, there was a wait, and TONS of open tables...which as a former GM of a restaurant, I could see was due to either A. Understaffing...or B.  just not moving people through at the HOST station.  To clarify, I AM TYPICALLY a lay down and VERY patient customer, and having been in the ""biz"" even yesterday I was as well.  We had to seat ourselves, and ASK for a booth to be cleaned.  Then, we sat down, and when the server came over to say hello, the woman I was with asked her to wipe off the table, as the dishes had been removed ONLY.   She ""grumped about it, and came back and wiped it down.  That was the beginning of the end of our experience.  I had to ask about any specials.  Nothing was explained.  She was rude, and paid ZERO attention to us.  We ordered drinks, and 3 appetizers to share as they were HALF OFF due to the NFL game.  That part was AWESOME!  We ordered the Avocado Eggrolls, a Sausage & Cheese Mini deep dish, and the Rootbeer glazed wings.  Wings were good, but WAY overcooked.  I like them crispy, but that should be a question that the servers asks. I dont know how they got that way, but they were about a 7 on a scale of 1-10.   Avocado eggrolls, were horrible.  Period.  Nothing but avocado and eggroll.  Nothing else.  No flavor, no fillings, nothing.  Lastly, the deep dish.  Came to table cold and got really cold fast.  Undercooked, and NOT at all what I would consider deep dish.  If I had paid FULL price for these apps, I would have sent all back.  We never ever saw a Manager, or even someone who Looks like a Manager.  We arrived at 530, left at 715,....and still noone..   I agree with many of the other reviews.  sterile.  No personal attention.  Nothing to make it memorable.  I would have given it NO stars, but there was one girl working in the bar area..blond hair/glasses, who was really sweet, and greeted me when I walked in.  That was it.  To add insult to injury, server left our dirty plates on the table the entire time, and dropped off the check without a word.  THEN, had the audacity to pick up the tab after I paid for it, WHILE WE WERE STILL SITTING THERE!  Didnt know they had a membership program. No training here, no evidence of management, no nothing.  I could turn this place around, but I dont think they could afford me!  :) 0-1 star is best I could give it.   It will be interesting to see if anyone responds to this...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tucson-2?start=60

The server did not say anything. Gave me the bill and apologized forgiving so many dimes for change.  I paid for the food I did not eat.
