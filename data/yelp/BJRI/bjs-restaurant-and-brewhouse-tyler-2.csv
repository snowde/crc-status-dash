Emily M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",24,120,88,3.0,8/23/2016,"Bjs is pretty hit or miss for me.   Its never bad,  but never spectacular either.   Beer selection is amazing and the bar doesn't disappoint.  The menu is insane and huge.   Its overwhelming and difficult to peruse.   If you ever find something you LOVE,  it will be gone from the menu next time you go.   Pazookies are pretty darn good,  they should bring back the smores one,  oh and the pizza dip!!  Service is generally slow so be prepared to spend some time here.  Sitting in the bar doesn't remedy this.  DO NOT go here for a quick lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2
Luis S.,"Irving, TX",46,77,67,4.0,4/4/2017,Not a beer guy myself. Atleast not until the past few months or so. I ordered a sampler and tried all their ciders. I loved the one that tasted like black cherry. I had thier ziti. It was spot on! It had meat as I think it should! Service was alright. I won't b running back but I would return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2
Alan W.,"Austin, TX",0,14,,1.0,11/12/2017,"This place SUCKS. Five of us went on a Friday night and food, beer and service ALL SUCKED. Rude waitress with poor attitude (Elisha S) was clearly not interested in providing service. We had burgers, pizza, salad, beer, cheese curds and none were really acceptable, despite been ridiculously expensive. Sloppy and crappy food paired with lousy service cross this place off our list of places to go a second time. No excuse for this level of incompetence in a bar or restaurant -- even in Tyler, Texas. Need to get their act together or get out of hospitality business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2
Steve M.,"Tyler, TX",0,20,,4.0,11/8/2017,Food and service always good. This trip (9/24/17) wife had her default Asian Chicken Salad and I tried (and liked) the BBQ salad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2
Eric T.,"Fort Worth, TX",687,815,2089,3.0,7/11/2015,"I've heard about the BJ's chain for quite some time, so I decided that during my brief trip into Tyler, I would try it out. In trying this brand for the first time, I left the location neither overwhelmed nor underwhelmed. It was sort of a ""meh"" experience.  THE GOOD: Customer service was really good. The hostess informed me that she would seat me with her best server, of which I agreed that the server was cool & attentive, for the most part. There was one moment where it took her nearly 8 minutes to bring me a glass of ice water due to me biting into a pepper, yet I let it go when I noticed that she had a large table of 8 guests that required 8 drinks + my water on a tray. Yes, I was empathetic toward her current situation. The decor of BJ's was nice. Certainly a place that I would bring my wife to, considering that the artwork looked really good, in addition to the color scheme throughout the venue. Not your typical bar restaurant, that's for sure. THE SO-SO: I'm a major IPA draft brew drinker, and I know a good one when I taste it. The IPA that I had on this evening was so-so: hoppy, yes. But the expected bite: not the best, yet not terrible either. It just didn't leave me excited to order another one. If I like a brew, I usually order 2-3. For tonight, it was one, which is a rarity for me. To top that off, I also enjoy Hefeweizen brews (thank you, Gordon Biersch), which is a German wheat-type of brew. To say the least, the Hefeweizen served at this location was not very good. In fact, it totally sucked. I was grateful for my server in giving me a sample of it first. I couldn't even finish half of the sample, considering that I felt a headache coming on. Yeah, that bad. I'm pretty sure the little man in the freezer had an off-day when it came to tapping the beer kegs today. SMH. The entree of the California flat bread was not bad. I was hungry, so I was not terribly picky about it. But one thing that I noticed was that the flat bread was more chewy as opposed to crunchy. Flat breads usually have a texture to that of a saltine cracker. This flat bread tasted more like a Domino's Pizza thin-crust pizza that was left on the kitchen's heat lamp for 15 minutes. I appreciated the server for not charging me for avocado slices on my flat bread, yet even with that, I thought that it was ""meh."" But again, I was hungry, and didn't have that ""I need a Snickers Bar moment"" by being overly too critical. Altogether, I would have to give either this BJs or another one a second try to have a full appreciation of what they offer. For this evening, it wasn't the best, yet not the worst either. It was just ""meh.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2
Brittani B.,"Keller, TX",0,34,10,3.0,5/14/2017,"I came here for Mother's Day. We were supposed to go to Texas Roadhouse, but the wait was 2 hours long. So, that won't work. I saw that there was a BJ's brewhouse nearby, and I got excited because I used to work at the Cheesecake Factory, and I know that the companies are similar!! So I called and asked how long the wait was.. only about 20 minutes!!! Wooo!! So we get here, and we get out at a small table barely able to seat us (we are a group of 5 adults and 2 children). Not that big of a deal I guess... but they have plenty of empty tables (some including the big round tops) that are available. We ended up moving ourselves over there. Okay so our waitress was overall not that great. She'd take forever to come ask us if we needed anything. We had to flag her down, which is embarrassing because we don't want to be those guest. She also wouldn't pick up our empty appetizer plates after we were done, they were taking up all of our space too. We had to ask her to take them, to which she replied she was helping another table and she'd help us when our food came. Oh hold on, she just took my baked potato away from me after I had just taken a bite out of it. Just because we were ordering dessert doesn't mean I was finished with my main course. In fact lady, we weren't even done eating when you came and asked if we wanted dessert, don't y'all normally wait until we are done? Ugh... luckily I don't live around here so at least I'll be back in south lake eating at the other location. I won't have to worry about this happening again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2

Joe H.,"Greeley, CO",10,286,25,5.0,2/21/2015,"Oh My God. (or OMG if you prefer). Italian Market Pizza is likely the best pizza I've had in the most recent years of my life. So Good... Beers are awesome. They have probably 40 taps for beers (check their website for info), but they also have about a dozen more taps with their own brewed beers. I had a pint each of the blond, Piranha Pale, and the hefeweizen.  All were good.  I've found my new favorite place in Tyler.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2
Rachel R.,"Dallas, TX",723,938,2737,4.0,10/19/2014,"I have eaten at BJ's before and have come here often to order a pizookie. This time, though we  came around 11:15am and had lunch.  We started off with the chips and salsa, which were surprisingly really tasty. I liked that the chips were thicker and the salsa had a great taste to it.  I ordered it the chicken club with thin and crispy french fries. The portion was huge and I could not finish all the fries and I was lucky to finish my sandwich. The chicken club was really good. I would definitely order it agian. I loved that it was on garlic texas toast. Yum! My only complaint would be that the avacado was too ripe. I had to scrape it off... Our server was less than enthused to be waiting on our table. She was not friendly and not very quick or attentive.   Overall, this was a delicious lunch. I would suggest coming in. If you come for lunch, it is not very busy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2
Traphena L.,"Tyler, TX",15,123,27,4.0,12/28/2016,"BJs is one of those lazy restaurant choices. If you are like me and have a hard time choosing a place to eat, just go to BJs because they have everything on their menu. I've had the pizza, burgers (of course), chicken, jambalaya, chicken sandwich, and they are all good! The waiter or waitress is always is good about helping you choose when you are stuck. I can't leave out the pizookies, that's one of the main reasons to go. I only get the chocolate chip one and it's by far the best in my opinion. It's always served hot, which I love. BJs is the way to go for any type of craving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2
Daniel W.,"Quitman, TX",0,51,1,3.0,11/29/2016,"Came for a decent, relatively inexpensive meal. Maybe we should've browsed the menu a little more because we discovered when our bill showed up that the medium pizza, that had mediocre flavor, was over $20!! The service was ok but we had to ask the server every, single time we wanted something removed from our table, and it was a very small, two-person table. The salad didn't come out prior to the meal and when asked for lemon for the Caesar Salad and fish, it didn't get brought until the meal was 1/2 way completed. We'd come back, but sadly we were not impressed at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2

I had two before happy hour was over... So yummy! Boyfriend got the first picture they had on the menu - an After Hours Burger. Man that thing looked yummy. He took a tiny bit home because of the large portion. Great value! I got the Lemon Thyme chicken with no butter as I have a dairy allergy. It was SO. YUMMY. I had to force myself to put my fork down.

I have only had one experience at this restaurant when I was not pleased about a year ago and when I spoke with the manager he was quick to make it right as best he could. I returned several times since then. My family and I love this place. This is a good quality restaurant with great food, employees etc... The manager is great. Great beer, awesome food, always get what I order as ordered. Order the bison burger or the salmon, the pizza is phenomenal. My kids love it too! No complaints.

Andrea A.,"Gilmer, TX",0,2,,1.0,7/24/2016,"Today was my first experience at this place. It took forever I'm talking 30 minutes easy that I waited on my burger. When it arrived you could tell it had been sitting maybe 20 minutes,it was the guacamole bacon cheese burger with no bacon. Just imagine white cheese sitting on a burger for 20 minutes. The guacamole was room temperature,the fries taste like wax and the patty was like rubber. The manager offered me a complimentary cup of soup on a very hot day. I requested he remove the burger from the tab. If zero stars were available I would've given that.

If the service was better and more consistent we would frequent BJs more often. The pazookies are the bomb but not worth the shady service. The last two times we were there, we found long hairs in one of our dishes. We also ended up sitting our booths for over 2 hours both times due to the slow service.

The soups and pasta are their weakness. So just stay away from those and you're solid! The Jeremiah red is one of the most popular and tasty beers.

The menu annoys me because it's a freaking NOVEL (but i do not subtract points because of that). The entrees and salads are usually very good. The pizza crust and toppings are very good however their portioning of the two needs a little work.

They have a great selection of beers, especially for Tyler--many of which are brewed in-house. Their lunch specials are very reasonable (it was $30 for the two of us, pre-tip, including 3 beers).  Their menu has a good selection of American food -- pizzas, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, soup, steak, etc. Everything that we've had was good. So far we've tried pizza, various soups, salad, and sandwiches, and didn't have anything that we didn't like. Everything was fresh, and the waitstaff was friendly and helpful. They are located in the parking lot of the Tyler mall, and have a nice outdoor patio. There is a full bar inside, along with ample seating and big booths.

The next afternoon, I was back in Tyler and nursing a severe ""headache"" and ""sour stomach.""  Remembering my friend's CFS, I thought, ""That is just what I need.""  And it was.  The double patty was filling, and the meat inside was tender.  The crust could have been seasoned a bit more, but there was salt and pepper on the table.  And the cream gravy was very good.  Only complaint was that the mixed vegetables were frozen, but I didn't come back for the mixed vegetables.  And no beer this time!!!

The ""lightly battered in blonde beer"" fish and chips came out like brown, deep fried grease sponges that one would expect at the carnival in the mall parking lot.  The beer was good, but not good enough to make me mindlessly consume the food.  We also tried the avocado spring rolls, which were basically undercooked Pilsbury crescent rolls stuffed with browning avocado and a lonely shred of a carrot... But the dipping sauce was sugary greatness, so we ate those, while watching other tables of very casually dressed individuals get down on various sundays and cheesecakes.  This is a place where I hope no one eats too often... Or perhaps we witnessed the gateway restaurant to Red Lobster.   That said, the server was very nice and we did get one half of one of the fish and chips taken off the bill.  The bill before the tip and after the reduction was $45, so next time we'll just go to the carnival.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-tyler-2?start=40

They just tasted like fried avocados that came with an extremely sugary sauce.  The beer was not too bad. The nutty brown had a great flavor profile and the Irish red was smooth and delicious.  I had a gluten free pizza. Kudos to the crust for being pretty edible. I know it's hard to do, but the sauce wasn't very good and they forgot to put roasted garlic on.  The service could use some work. Christopher was trying, but doesn't quite understand the steps of service. This could be a lack of training on the restaurants part, which I fully understand. Let alone the large gaps in time between table visits, we had empty glasses and plates sitting around and after he came to ask us if the food was alright I had to prompt him as he walked away to take the empty glasses and things to free up space.

Score!  I didn't even think it had been that long!  I ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and onion strings. It had two chicken fried steaks on it.

I don't even like balsamic and I loved this meal!  His had two chicken breast and mashed potatoes with white cheddar in it.  So we both have enough food for a second meal. Mine cost $10, his $12.
