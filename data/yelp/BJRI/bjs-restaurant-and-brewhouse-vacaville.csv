Danae L.,"Fremont, CA",360,437,79,4.0,12/4/2017,"Called in on 12/03 at 7 PM for a party of 25. The host explained that there is a large group about to leave and we could swoop the area if arrived ASAP. Our entire party arrived within half an hour but the area was still occupied. The host explained that they've been here since 5 PM and the bill is paid so they should be leaving any minute. Unfortunately we ended up waiting an entire hour. I saw a few tables open up, but for whatever reason the staff wanted us to wait for the specific corner.  Service was quick and smooth.

Sam T.,"San Leandro, CA",67,79,11,1.0,11/20/2017,"Terrible pizza today ... First of, service was very slow.  Ordered online hoping that we can get the order in time during our lunch hour.  Nope that didn't help.   BJ was having 1/2 off on Monday for large pizzas.  I believe they compensate by halving the toppings on the pizzas because there were rarely any toppings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville
Jose I.,"Dixon, CA",1,29,2,1.0,10/23/2017,"I won't suggest you not to visit this well known restaurant, but without a doubt I need to ask you to check the utensils before taking them to your mouth.   The last two times my family and I have visited BJ's, we have had the disgusting experience of finding utensils with food residues on it.  No water stains, but food residues on more than one utensil.  First time was so disgusting I couldn't post the photos; pieces of onions on the utensils.  The second time, yesterday, the waitress asked the manager to come to us.  The manager listened to our complaint, and limited himself to apologize.  I got the impression he was more concerned about preventing others from seeing the old food residues on the utensils.   What shocked us the most was the way he dismissed the whole situation.  He told me: ""Feel free to go or to stay"". That was when I decided to post the utensils photo.  Of course, he didn't know I took photos. Thank you for reading my review, and don't forget to watch out for BJ's lack of hygiene.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville
Samantha L.,"Vacaville, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/9/2018,"My husband and I each ordered a dinner meal. Mine came out before his, and we waited 20+ minutes before asking where his food was, thinking maybe since it was busy that it was just taking a while. My drink also sat without a refill during this time.The waiter forgot to put my husband's order in the computer. 40 minutes after putting our initial order in, we still didn't have his meal. We decided to just pack my food up and take it as a loss, but the manager came over and offered to comp our meals.

Avtar S.,"Woodland, CA",28,100,114,2.0,7/23/2017,This was one of my worst visits to BJs. I had to wait an hour for food even though it wasn't busy and then the service was so so. I gave my rewards card and the server forgot to load my points. Food was okay. I got the A Drink Like That which always tastes amazing. No Pizookie today bc they took so long getting food. I expect a lot better as I frequent BJs a lot.  Update : came in on a Sunday. Took 40 mins to get food and it came in 2 at a time. By the time one thing came the others had already eaten. Unacceptable slow service when it's not even that busy. Manager didn't even care when we complained to him and walked off like it's not a big deal at all. No urgency from manager!!! Won't come to this location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville
Joven S.,"Fairfield, CA",19,111,311,3.0,6/17/2017,"What can I say, it's BJ's. Been here on many occasions, from get togethers, birthdays, and just for a meal. Overall the restaurant is always busy. The tables and restrooms are usually clean. Depending on how busy the place is, the wait can be between 5-30 minutes. Service for the most part is average, which is why I only gave 3 stars. The staff and servers are friendly, but the level of service can fluctuate everytime.  Now to the food. Usually go with their soup and salad combo. The chicken tortilla soup is probably my favorite thing here. I tried their seared ahi tuna salad. The ingredients are good, but their ginger soy vinaigrette is hit or miss. The last time I tried it, it was way too salty. Stuffed mushroom appetizer is good but not mind blowing, and I've also had their wedge salad which was good.  I'm sure I'll be back at BJ's again. The food is decent, it's fairly close to home, but they could definitely work on their service. If they could increase the quality of service in a consistent way, I would give them 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville

Viclaire S.,"Fairfield, CA",266,342,1916,2.0,1/22/2017,"I give this place a 2 because, darn, I want to give it more, but each time I return, it keeps declining in service.  I do appreciate the variety of beers, food, desserts they have, but the service needs some help.  We were seated right away, both myself and my husband wanted the unlimited soup and salad.  Unaware that it only pertains to the WEEKDAYS, we ordered, even pointing it on the menu to the server while ordering.  I know, we probably should have read the menu more however, I feel the server has a responsibility to give us a heads up.  How we found out?  Read below.   When she finally came, she asked if we wanted anything else or dessert.  This is how we found out about the soup/salad:  My husband wanted another chicken tortilla soup and she says it is only available for weekdays.  HMMM.  Mind you, this was very late in our meal, meaning- we were not checked on throughout our meal. We told her no and then it took awhile for her to bring our check AND did not clear our table.  We had 2 empty bowls and 2 plates the ENTIRE time.   What annoyed me the most was that she smiled and acted like she did a great job.  Not once did she apologized for taking too long, and not clarifying the unlimited soup/salads. I can't say I won't be back here again.  Chances are, I will.  But it won't be as often and it could be.  I hope management can turn it around here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville
Amber M.,"Fairfield, CA",2,55,78,1.0,7/22/2017,"It's always hit or miss with BJ's. Thursday was a MISS.  Arrived for early lunch at 10:50am and waited for doors to open at 11:00am.  We were second to be seated.  By 11:15am 8 tables sitting with me menus and no drinks.  We were all sat side by side, back to back in a huge restaurant.  The music was even louder than it usually is, it seemed.  It was clear this wasn't starting off well.  I ordered a unlimited soup and salad.  It arrived at 11:45am.  Every table was looking around and talking out loud questioning the service and wait time.  The tortilla soup was room temperature (which made me nervous).  It was covered in chips-- I asked for NO chips on top. I had to scoop them off to a napkin and after five or six spoonfuls the soup was gone.  I ordered a refill and that one arrived with no chips, and with avocado, cilantro, and cheese on top and was piping hot.  Who got the first one together? The server who realized we'd been waiting for ever?  The table beside had already given the server a hard time and I saw another getting ready.  We wanted to just pay, leave, and go home and eat something.  It's so obvious where BJ's goes wrong and lacks inefficiency.  Sometimes you get a good server and sometimes you don't.  A good management team would rectify that. There is no excuse for the wait time when staff exceeds the customer ratio, for the excessive music volume, and inconsistent food items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville

Tonight was probably the worse because of our rude stuck up waitress. Her negative vibe just made the night awkward for me and my guests. Not only was our waitress bad but the food took MORE then an hour to arrive we were in that restaurant for 2 hours! When we were trying to get our check to leave the waitress was no where in sight.

Emily J.,"Concord, CA",380,1294,166,2.0,6/25/2017,"After a morning of outlet shopping my mom and I decided to pop in here for a bite to eat. We had been previously and I tend to give BJs a solid three stars.  On this day, they were particularly busy, probably due to it being end of the school year/grad season. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait and we didn't wait nearly that long, which was great. Until we waited for what felt like forever after being seated.  We were there for at least 10 minutes before our server was able to get to us. In his defense, he seemed to be juggling a lot of tables, including at least one big 12+ group. We waited another 10 minutes or so for our iced tea and lemonade.  Then we waited some more...  And some more...  30+ minutes later our server, who we hadn't seen since we ordered, finally pops by to let us know that my grilled shrimp tacos were taken to the wrong table by mistake. He said that they were redoing my dish right then and it shouldn't be much longer. Another 15 minutes pass and our dishes finally arrived.  Right as we started to finally eat, a manager came by to check on us. She was super apologetic and offered a free pizookie to try to make it up to us. A nice gesture, although I didn't really want her to stick around and chat because we were quite hungry at that point. The food itself was alright. Unfortunately, it seemed that my mom's burger and fries spent some time under a heat lamp waiting on the take two of my food.  We did take them up on the free pizookie offer, and got a mini salted caramel. Unfortunately, it lacked the salted caramel flavor and half the cookie stuck to the little pan.

And the restaurant was FULL, with waiting line, and our meals came quickly.  And the restaurant floors and table/benches were very clean. We all ordered very different dishes and all of them were top notch!  Veggies were fresh, not overcooked.  Fish and Chips were probably the BEST I've ever had.  The ""enlightened"" Lemon Thyme Chicken with red peppers, Brussel sprouts, onions and brown rice was OVER THE TOP awesome.  The Chicken breast was tender and flavorful!  The Shrimp pasta was also incredibly delicious as was the Spaghetti and meatballs.  The servings (except the pasta) were HUGE.  Our waitress and other staff were friendly, attentive and efficient.  It astounds (and impresses) me how a LARGE chain, totally PACKED with a waiting line, can deliver four meals simultaneously, all very different, and ALL cooked perfectly.  We WILL be visiting this restaurant again.

Plenty of time to chat & catch up. Our server (I don't remember her name) was very nice & seemed to take our orders intently, however when our food came out there were a few items missing. My Mother & my sister's meals didn't arrive until 25 minutes after everyone else received theirs, meaning they were left to watch everyone else eat. Also the rack of ribs that my brother clearly told her we were going to split (and she repeated back to him) never made it to our table. My ribeye steak (ordered medium) came out well done & was rather tasteless. I ate only half if it because it was very unappetizing. Very disappointing.

Amanda L.,"San Mateo, CA",83,224,145,3.0,11/23/2016,"3 stars! The bf and I came in to have some dinner on a cold, rainy night. Mostly the reason we came here was because we wanted to watch the Warriors game and treat ourselves, woohoo!  We waited about 20 minutes (watch out for when it gets busy, not much standing room while you wait, esp. when it's raining outside...).  Our server Kevin was super cool, we ordered a calamari right off the bat, then ordered a clam chowder in sourdough bread bowl (for me) and jambalaya (for bf). Kevin was super friendly, helped us with our choices, and provided us with the pizzokie menu, yay! The calamari was pretty standard, no big deal, I always appreciate that they offer the marinara or the Ranch-ish dressing, nomm.  I recommend the sourdough bread bowl, because so far, every BJ's I have gone to has NOT let me down! Always a great flavor of some garlic and the right amount of savor. The clam chowder was yummy, not overly salty and just the right amount as well to fit into the bowl. It was filled with lots of seafood goodies, so at least they didn't skimp out! :)  The jambalaya was kind of a miss, overly spiced and needed a little more rice pilaf to balance out the KICK IN THE FACE flavor. Maybe our chef just over spiced?  Oh, and need I say anything about the pizookie? It was SO YUM. Just one was enough for the two of us. We enjoyed the cookies n cream flavor, and the cookie was very rich.  Overall, 3 to 3.5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=20

It has been a while since we last visited, figured it was time to catch up and ""talk story."" This is the first time I've been to this particular BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse since moving from SoCal/South Orange County. I used to frequent their Lake Forest location @ the Laguna Hills Mall quite often, good times, and service was always great. Met NB just around 4:45pm, there were a few open spots in the bar area which is on a, ""First come, first serve,"" basis. Not to mention it's the Happy Hour ""Fun Zone!"" (i.e. - Only the bar area qualifies for the HH Specials) - ""Well, hell... 'Twist my arm, again."" Happy Hour Specials -  The bar had no open stools so NB and I grabbed a table directly across from it.  Photo -  We looked over the drink menu and I thumbed through it looking for something I saw the other week @ Buffalo Wild Wings, ""Not Your Father's Root Beer."" (5.9% alcohol)  Patrice our waitress, stellar. She was very friendly, good energy, upbeat, and trés helpful... 'Not to mention, patient. NB was split between the Ahi Poke and the Avocado Egg Rolls, two very tempting appetizers. Like me, NB is from Hawaii, I added, ""DO NOT expect it to be like da kine we get back on da aina, the poke here is haolified, dressed up with extra sh'tuff... Kinda like a hooker on Kuhio Avenue."" (Well, at least that's what I've heard... Oh, and Business avenue too.) So, the Avocado Egg Roll Appetizers it was! Me, pizza of course! 'Unless there's sushi, then it's sushi... 'AND pizza!! If they could find a way to make a pizza/sushi fusion dish, that would be awesome! They could call it ""P'ushi!"" I could eat p'ushi all night... 'And it's always good the next morning too! The mini deep dish pizzas are  1/2 off for Happy Hour, great deal. I decided on the Gourmet Five Meat Pizza w/added jalapeños & garlic, for good measure.  Patrice stopped by our table to take our drink orders as NB and I were deciding on what to eat. I asked her if BJ's carried, ""Not Your Father's Root Beer?"" Unfortunately, as I presumed, the answer was no... 'BUT they did have BJ's very own, ""Irish Root Beer."" Menu -  'With a description like that, I was sold! Shortly after placing our order, Patrice came by and apologized but she was being moved to cover another section of the bar and that Zahs was going to be covering our table. I have to admit, a part of me was bummed to see Patrice go, she rocked!  The order: Avocado Egg Rolls (HH Price: $8.95) - Okay; good portions Photo -  Mini Gourmet 5 Meat Deep Dish Pizza (HH Price: $6.63) - Tasty; generous toppings; good HH value Photo -  Irish Root Beers x2 (HH Price: $7.50 x2) - Hot damn!; great; good HH value Photo -  Grand total w/tip: $40 Overall, the food was good. Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed in the Avocado Egg Roll appetizers. I was hoping for more than oversized, meatless taquitos. However, in this case the guacamole IS the filling. I know it's a crowd favorite but I just found it to be okay. NB, on the other hand, kinda dug it. (Shrugs) I expected nice size chunks of avocado, not this mushy, green purée.  Photo -  Now, for the $$, the HH Special on BJ's mini pizzas are pretty hard to beat. I prefer my food to have a bit of kick, added jalapeños and garlic, please... 'No linguicia on the menu, not too many places carry Portuguese Sausage. I requested extra sauce as well but do no think it found its way on the pizza, not a deal breaker. I enjoyed the pizza much more than the appetizer. Photo -  Now, the Irish Root Beer was pretty damn awesome!... It could've used a tad more Jameson, Baileys, and Butterscotch Schnapps but nonetheless it was DEEE'LICIOUS! After a couple of sips, I told NB to wait a moment before finishing the drink. I was able to flag down Zahs, ""May I have two shots of bar cream?"" Irish Root Beer + One shot of bar cream = One fine adult root beer float (For the kid in all of us!)

David R.,"Vacaville, CA",0,18,,2.0,7/31/2017,"Eating at BJ's in Vacaville can be summed up in Elisabeth Kübler-Ross's 5 Stages of Grief. Denial - ""BJ's will be better this time"" ""The service last time was a fluke, no way will be there for 3 hours again!"" ""The hour and half wait it took my server to bring my check last time wasn't so bad"", ""They have a $10 off coupon on their app!"". At this point you have convinced your friends/family to go to Bj's. Anger - It's happened again, you gave BJ's the benefit of the doubt, now you've been there for 3 hours. Your Friends and Family are angry at you because ""YOU WERE THE ONE WANTED TO GO TO BJ'S!"", and ""This is why we don't come here anymore"". Bargaining - The guilt of choosing BJ's for Dinner makes you lose your appetite at this point, your friends hate you, your wife wants to divorce you, your 7 year old Daughter wants to move out. You try and win them over by offering a Pizookie or telling them ""We won't come here anymore""(even though we both know it's a lie.), ""You can choose where we eat next time, just stop hating me!"". Depression - Everyone hates you because you brought them to a 21st century concentration camp known as BJ's. Your dinner party is ignoring you as they sit staring into their phones at the table. Now that your server has cashed you out, the shackles have been lifted you're free to leave. Tonight you will sleep cold, and lonely for you have chose poorly.

We are not from this area and were just visiting my friends family. When we arrived that night the first host with light brown hair that was coordinating was extremely friendly and tried her best to accommodate us. The girl  with dark brown hair and a massive attitude that was seating us finally came back to the host stand.  The first girl told us she would be seating us right now so we stood up. The dark haired brunette girl looked at us. Didn't speak and literally started walking away. We assumed that meant follow her. She literally raced her way over to the table she was taking us to and left us behind. Before we even got to the table she threw the menus down and walked back to the host stand. Thank you?  My friend and I used to be hosts at a different restaurant. We know AT THE LEAST say hi. If they were busy at the host stand I would understand but we were the only ones up there.  The server was friendly. We did like her. We saw she had a lot of tables so we didnt want to be difficult and ask for a lot. The part that annoyed me was she ended up offering us a free pizookie we didnt ask for. So we just said okay. She never came back with it and just handed us the check.

Wait staff has always been very friendly, accommodating, and appropriately attentive. So far I've had the Asian Chicken Salad which was very good (from what I remember). It was large and very filling.  It had all the right proportions of greens, meats, extras - and the dressing was very nice. Yesterday I ordered the Fish 'n Chips. And I will say they are very good.  The dish came with probably 4 pieces of fish which was a nice plump white fish perfectly cooked. The batter was crispy and thin (the way I like it).  It was, however, salty and that could have been the tartar sauce - which I wasn't a big fan of since they tried to ""doctor"" it up.  Keep it simple folks!  I was impressed that it was served with Malt Vinegar - is there any other way to eat fish 'n chips?  Seriously??  The fries were wedge cut potatoes and very good! I would have like to have a small side of coleslaw - but the dish doesn't come with it - hmmm. Everyone at our table got something slightly different and it all looked good.  From the soup in the sourdough bread bowl, the artisan pizza, the fettuccine Alfredo, and burgers!  We also ordered a combination sample appetizer and it was very good.  There was some sort of avocado egg rolls (my favorite), hot artichoke dip, chips, breaded cheese sticks, and ? something else.  Everyone loved it!

I called at 11:05AM and the order time on my receipt says 11:08AM.  I ordered the Bacon Chicken Ranch and a BJ's Favorite, both well done.  The host said it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I gave them a little extra, due to ordering well done?  I got out of there, after waiting and paying a bit after 12 noon.   The chain is notorious for wait times.  Maybe they had to call Corporate to see if they were really 1/2 off/!! The cashier and few staff I met were chipper and friendly early into their work day on a slow Monday late morning.  Precious little parking which I guess was because all the staff took it. These pizzas are OBVIOUSLY PAN pizzas and nowhere NEAR  ""deep dish;"" FAIL!  One pizza was cooked well done, the other, absolutely NOT.  On both, the toppings started 2+"" in toward the center and the edges were rounded.  Deep dish, if anything folks.  You DO make food for a living, right?   The cheese on the underdone pizza, of course, was smarmy.  The dough on both were s.o.g.g.y., but much more, of course, on the under cooked one.   Toppings?  Folks, if you're going to LIST toppings, include them in a large enough amount to identify them.  It's like were afraid someone was going to be allergic to the non-meat toppings (onions, green peppers, tomatoes, etc), so they put only a 1/2 teaspoon of them on.  The pepperoni was wafer thin and NOT overwhelmingly tangy, so it is definitely a money saving measure.  The Italian sausage and seasoned chicken is frozen pizza grade [Ha!  You thought I was going to say ""quality?""!].  The small amount of seasoned tomatoes are simply strained from bruschetta , with the good oil/seasonings likely going into some other dish on the menu. The chicken was diced in hard bits...can we say left over makin's from the previous night?   The bacon was authentic, fried and diced up....not from a bag of Hormels/Costco Bacon bits and not dehydrated.  The few points earned are quickly lost by the complete absence of the touted hand-made house meatballs. I KNEW I'd done been had, when I braced me muscular arms for the heft of two, LARGE DEEP DISH pizzas and the boxes almost hit the ceiling, they were so... light...like, just lifting cardboard! Had I paid the full price of $25+ for each of these, they'd be sitting on the manager's desk right now.   I'm so put off that I won't fall for any other offerings even if they're 100% off Tuesdays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=100
Amber L.,"Fairfield, CA",21,34,,2.0,1/12/2017,"This place can be hit or miss.  I keep giving it another chance but it keeps disappointing me.  Over the holidays my family decided to celebrate my brothers birthday.  Service for drinks was slow but it was somewhat busy (not packed).  After we ordered it took forever to get our food.  Our waitress kept coming back telling us our food was almost up. Finally the food comes but they told my mother, who ordered ribs, they dropped her plate and they are making another ASAP. The entire table finished their meal.   My mother was very upset and just wanted to leave.  My husband talked to someone who said they would check on it. About 15 more mins go by and the ribs finally showed up.   The manager did comp the ribs.   This is just one of many examples of poor service.  I did give it two stars since once you finally get your food it's pretty good.

If I have to ask for refill you are cutting into your tip and not doing your job Mr. Waiter. Thats being said the food had phenominal cosmoc powers and there was a LOT of it. The fish tacos are HUGE, the chips they came with were disappointing as they were still dripping with hot oil. Wife had a plate full of normal dry rub chicken wings but they were better than the crap wings at Buffalo Wild Wings. Finished up with the cookies n cream pazookie because we didnt go full retard on dinner. I will be going back for just the fish tacos. And the pazookie. And burying it all with their house stout. Good times.  It was crowded as hell on a friday night but a party of 2 doesnt wait long. I imagine the wait is worth it. Knew there was going to be a wait because we had to park by the Petco, but again totally OK by me. I had the pizzas here about 10 years ago but I'm not sure I can now ever get past the fish tacos.

Classic White Chocolate Macadamia Nut really hit the spot!  All of the food and drinks came out really quickly and everything tasted good.

Anne R.,"Hercules, CA",5000,829,322,3.0,3/3/2016,"Ive always been a fan of BJs because there food is decent, there service is decent, so much food and different drinks to choose from and fairly priced. I normally go the Concord location because it is closer to me but when I am in the Vacaville area I will come here. On a busy weekend there will be a wait but you get seated in less than 30 minutes if you have a smaller group. If you have a large group you might want to call ahead and make reservations to make sure you aren't waiting forever. The service here is relatively good but sometimes you do get the occasional crappy service who forgets to being utensils, enough napkins or even water to your table. The atmosphere is on the loud side, so don't come here if you want a romantic setting.

Gary R.,"Sausalito, CA",42,8,2,2.0,7/27/2015,"We arrived at about 6 pm on a Monday evening . We had to work our way up to the host/hostess stand as the restaurant was about 50 percent full but the staff was unable to keep up with the crowd arriving after work and so there was about a two minute wait for a table even though there were many tables clearly empty and ready for everyone waiting.  We told the hostess we would just sit at the bar, since we didn't want to wait.  When we walked to the bar it was about 80 percent full, but there were no seats available. The seats that were not occupied by paying customers were occupied by purses and people's legs, like at a busy airport terminal. The staff seemed to make no effort to accommodate new guests, even after we complained to the hostess.  We were seated at a table on the wall opposite the bar, on the other side of the restaurant. Our table was about eight inches from the table next to us. It felt like we were at a Japanese steakhouse.  When our server arrived we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome. We ordered two happy hour drinks but we were informed that happy hour was only in the bar area.  That is GARBAGE!  How can a restaurant charge more for the exact same drink just because you are sitting a couple feet too far from a half full unseatable bar area.  We expressed our frustration and we were told many customers say the same thing. Our appetizer was offered to the wrong table. Thankfully they said it wasn't theirs, so we eventually got it.  Our food arrived and after being auctioned off at the table it was very flavorful, albeit over cooked and dry.  We ordered wine and as it was delivered our server was apparently friends with people at the table next to us. So, after a minute of catching up, we got our server's proper attention. I really had wanted this to be a great experience. With the happy hour and the 'enlightened' menu, this could have been a regular restaurant for us. Unfortunately, this was a huge miss.  If we had seen a manager in our section, visiting tables and interacting with customers, instead of standing by the entrance to the kitchen or leaning against the hostess stand, maybe we could have addressed our concerns.  Management, I invite you to address my concerns and let me know if I should ever come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=120
Courtney M.,"Vacaville, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/19/2016,"I have now had two terrible visits with this bjs.  Visit #1 First off, it took an entire 2 hours for us to get out of that place. Let me explain. There were only 2 of us and I was the only one that ordered an entree plate. We only got water my entre and then a pizzookie for each of us. It took 40 minutes for those 2 pizookis to come out after I was finished eating my panini. Not to mention this entire 40 mins our waitress only came out once about half way through to let us know it'll be up any sec... 20 mins is no where close to a few seconds! She did not communicate with us that the oven was down and that's why it took so long. We could have just passed on the pizookis!  Visit #2  We got seated right away in a hidden away table... the next 15 minutes we saw about 10 waiters and none of them even acknowledged us. Who knows where our waitress was??? Also this was on a Tuesday night and it wasn't very busy. Finally we decided to just get up and leave... we got much better service at outback steak house! As we walked out we let the front desk host people know we were leaving and the reason behind it. THEY JUST STARED AT US! no sorry or anything they just smiled and said okay. So good riddance to BJs!

Every time we started to ask for something our server would take off and get the first thing we asked for without sticking around to hear our other requests. He would of saved at least 4 back and fourth trips if he just stuck around to listen. After finishing our meal I only had one refill on my tea, not one for my water and my wife didn't get a refill on her water either.

Michelle R.,"Fairfield, CA",0,14,,1.0,2/2/2017,"I am not one to complain or have high expectations at chain restaurants and I have resisted writing a review as I prefer to give places the benefit of the doubt, but the last time we went will BE the last time. We have been going here for years but finally reached our breaking point with the service. It has without fail, been terrible service with every waiter/waitress we have had over the last year or so. Things that happen every time:  -Dirty silverware -Food always comes either all at once (appetizers and entrees) or out of order (main dish then salad/appetizers) -Waiters/Waitresses always rush you to order and leave -They never take away any dirty dishes to help clear the table Now for some details on our last visit: As per usual, our waiter rushed us but we expected that. He had very long hair that was in his face the whole time and not pinned back like women have to have. We ordered an appetizer and each a main dish. The waiter came out and told us that the main dish will be coming out before the appetizer.  He then brings out our food. I had ordered no aioli (allergy reason only) and avocado on the side (to share with the person I was there with). I touched my sandwich and then realized there was no avocado on the side. I asked him for the avocado on the side, so he TAKES MY SANDWICH away from me and says he grabbed the wrong one AFTER I TOUCHED IT (so sorry for whoever he gave it to! yuck!). About 5-7 minutes later he tells me they made my new one with aioli - normally I wouldn't care but like I said, it's a severe allergy issue for me. So I waited another 10 minutes (about 15-20 minutes total) and my sandwich finally came.  Meanwhile, the person I was with had already finished his food. He had asked for ketchup in the midst of everything, but the water brought him a completely empty one (amazed he didn't notice how light the bottle was). Our appetizer dishes were never taken from the table and our water was never topped off.  The waiter DID offer us a complimentary pizookie - which was nice - but it took another 20 minutes to come out and was so incredibly burnt that we couldn't eat it. It was black on the bottom and completely rock hard on the top.  After receiving little to no attention from our waiter, I finally asked someone else for our check so we could leave - we were there (just the two of us) for 2 hours. It was unreal.  In addition, the fire alarm went off while we were there and that went on for quite some time. No explanation or anything was given to the people dining there...it was very strange.  I hope this place gets better servers soon because the menu is great - just not worth the hassle anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=80

I ordered the fish & chips which I have had several times. Well it was the wrong choice this time. They came way over cooked!  I sent them back. It was a good 20 min or so and I had to ask our waiter about my dinner,, ""they said it should be right out"".  Guess what it wasn't! By this time the manager came over and said they ran out of fish and the rest was frozen. By this time the rest of the family had all finished their meals.  I told the manager to just take it off the bill. Of course he gave the superficial apologies.  Nothing else was offered or said.  The icing on the cake...the waiter tried to SELL us desert!

My old friends and I always go here for get-togethers on the weekends or just to catch up with each other and eat pizookies!  Pizookies, pizza, and beer are definitely the must-haves at this restaurant. Before you even decide on what entree you want, make sure to save a menu and not eat too much to the point where you're too full for dessert.. cause believe me, you'll totally regret it when you see other tables around you indulging in all the different types of pizookies. From red velvet, to raspberry white chocolate almond, to Ghiradelli's triple chocolate, to even gluten-free chocolate chip! Okay, but forreal besides pizookies, BJ's offers a wide variety of options for appetizers and entrees. Almost so many that it's hard to decide.  Our favorite appetizers to order are the fried calamari and the avocado egg rolls. If you can't choose, try out their sampler appetizer (avocado egg rolls, santa fe spring rolls, spinach & artichoke dip, and mozzarella sticks)! As for the main meal, if you're with a group, a good choice would be trying out one of their pizzas like the classic great white (chicken alfredo) or the bbq chicken. They also let you order half of one and half of another type if there's two toppings that you want, instead of having to order 2 pizzas which is great. There are also flatbread pizza appetizers, delicious burgers, and lots of low-calorie 'enlightened' options that are still quite flavorful such as the bbq bison burger and hawaiian mahi-mahi over pineapple fried rice.

We had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. When the hostess took us to our table, she picked up a highchair on the way for our 1 year old that was covered in broccoli from the last child that used it...she walked away before I could ask her to wipe it down. I mean, shouldn't it be MANDATORY that the highchairs are scrubbed after each child uses it?? Those things get filthy after one use! Anyway, no one even acknowledged us for over 20 minutes as we sat there. I finally waved down a random person, who happened to be Mona, who's section was clear on the other side of the restaurant, but offered to wait on us anyway! She was on top of everything, very friendly, & even had her manager take off our appetizer for our inconvenience. Her service definitely deserves 5 stars, but I'm rating the entire restaurant as a whole. The food was mediocre (except for the potstickers, they are always delicious!) & expensive.

The tanks are there but no beer is actually brewed here...The closest BJ's that brews beer is in Reno. So to start off I am already deducting one star for this very reason from my review. We are at 4 stars now.  Ambiance is classic sports pub/bar/restaurant...loud and flashy with dozens of flat screens flickering. There is a dining room to the left and a bar area to the right of the entrance as at any other BJs I've been to. Waitress came over to take orders...As there was a ""specials"" menu on the table I ordered the seasonal Double IPA they advertise. Guess what? The gal came back and said they were out. Next I tried my luck with the Belgian special release....no luck there either. So what it comes down to is two beers they advertise at EVERY table are not available. Another star down. We are at 3 stars now. Eventually I settled for Arrogant Bastard as any  of the other brews they had on tap were not appealing and I tried all BJs own beers in the past anyway.  The funny thing was the service staff is so misinformed about the ""BREWHOUSE"" menu that they don't even know what is on tap. Co-worker asked for Kona Longboard and the gal was ""We don't carry that!""..even though they do and it is clearly listed on the beer menu. Another star down. So now we're at two. Finally the food..The food is okay. Not super-great, not super-bad. Just average. Had mini chicken tacos and they tasted aight. The service besides being slow and misinformed was not horrible.

You can order either one on different days and it is totally different, sometimes so different that i send it back.. WARNING. If you send it back, it's not going to get better, my advice is to order something basic like a burger.  Difference is okay as long as the basic flavors are still there. 2) When using the take out, the person on taking the order has a most difficult time.  This was not always the case, see one of my previous reviews.  In the past 6-8 months it takes 5-10 minutes to get it ordered. 3) The online ordering menu DOES NOT have all the dishes, so unless you know the menu, you wont get all items.   ADITIONALLY, the web design has changed and has become VERY difficult to navigate.   A AEARCH FUNCTION would be extremely helpful",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=200

It had fried onion strips on top that were soggy and cold. My fries were also cold and stale. Needless to say, I sent it back. When the bill came it wasn't taken off the bill.

Everything seemed well until I got home and discovered there was no cheese on the pizza. It also had stray onions on the pizza which I am allergic to. I don't order out often and decided to go with a more high end pizzeria that costs more thinking that I would get better quality. This is unacceptable BJ's.  L. B. Update: I called to speak with the manager and my order was replaced. The pizza itself was good. However, instead of the chicken sausage, I had regular sausage. Also, I did find an onion on my slice I was eating. Overall, the quality was good and I feel the management did make a sincere effort to correct the problem. And they did ask me to check it before I left (I had curbside, it was dark outside and I did not have time to wait for a new one).

Ahman M.,"Vacaville, CA",0,44,10,1.0,11/11/2015,"So this was the 1st time I walked into BJ's since it came to Vacaville and what happened blew my mind. So let me tell you. A friend had come to town and we decided on BJ's and we got in, in 5 mins which tells you that it was not that busy and NO while we were seated there was no line at the door and seats still open. So we got service and she took my drink order and said she'd come back for my food order. She brought my drinks fast and took our order, that was the last thing that went right.  I order coffee, no spoon to stir my coffee, common sense, right? So I asked for a spoon and we waited, 10 mins later no spoon, She comes back and it's been 10 mins more and no spoon and no silverware. WOW right? Nope, she comes back 10 mins later to say she will see where our order is, 10 mins later it finally comes. She puts it down and leaves. Guess what? No silverware. So I have eaten already and ordered dessert ( Not that good) and my friend ordered a stake med/well, well we got med/rare and we were not happy. Did I mention it took another 5 to bring silverware. By the time she brought the silverware she just asks me do I need a spoon for coffee.  Now, we are mad and ask for the manager and got a supervisor. And he was pleasant, but didn't offer ANY suggestions on how to rectify the issue. My friend was pissed and I was not having any of it. I said I'll pay for the drinks and my dessert and we left. Pissed. So I took her to Freebirds and she loved it. 5 STARS! for them. Over all we almost spent a whole hour waiting for food and bad service. My friend has been to BJ's before and said this wasn't the normal. On the other hand, my 1st impression was horrible. So I guess it will be years before I go again. I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. Good service is good service, i'm not harsh unless you make me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=180

The place is very large and can accommodate large parties well, but does get busy. Servers are good and the prices are pretty standard.  They have a large bar and a ton of beer on tap. They even have their own brews and can do flights and pitchers of all the different types they make.  Food-wise the pizza was great with tons of different types and sizes all the way down to mini.

At this visit, however, we received way less than their usual service from their waitperson --Heather. She was slow, totally inattententive and her poor service really affected our meal. After working thru our entree's about 1/2 way, we were finally able to attract her attention to request the status of our missing appetizers. She disappeared and did not return with any status. They finally showed up about 10 mins after and we had finished our entries. We had to again ""find"" heather to request a coffee fill up. She never did check in how we were doing or if we needed anything although she passed by on several occasions. It was impossible to attract her attention. Obtaining the bill resulted in the same delay. She was not observant and appeared ""non-caring"". In all honesty this is not the usual for BJ's as we usually receive top notch service from all the wait staff coupled with awesome food and beverages. Heather does not meet their standards of customer service (not anybodies). We will be back but hope not to ever be in this persons section again.

DISLIKES:  my two boys finished their orange juice and my hubby and mom finished their coffees and we HAD TO FIND our waiter to ask for refills.  Didn't like that he didn't come by to check up on us while we were waiting for food....or to give a little courtesy update as to why food was taking so long.   LIKES:  as soon as my hubby brought it to another waiters attention (and then mike walked by my hubby and the other waiter so he got to hear from my hubby as well) our food came out within a matter of 10 min.  The manager, Jacob, came out and apologized to the table.  He apologized for the long wait and proceeded to explain to us that there were troubles in the kitchen area.  Our meals were complimentary since we had to wait for so long.  I appreciate a restaurant who takes the time to apologize to their customers and make it up to them as well WITHOUT asking us, what we want them to do for us.  Thank you Jacob for taking care of us!   I still give this company a 5 star rating because this is the only time after years of going to this establishment that we had this kind of service today.  The food was still excellent, and Jacob redeemed their customer service.  A few months ago, we celebrated my husbands birthday dinner here with a few friends and family and the staff was very accommodating to my needs and requests.  Still worth my time returning here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=180

So that means when you arrive your added then to the list & that is when your wait time starts. A few in our party got there prior to 6PM and so our wait time was only about 25 minutes: not to bad.  Seemed the staff were very good at quickly getting our tables together & accommodating our large party.  Our service was very good. Amanda was our main server ""excellent"" and all the employees that assisted along with her did a wonderful job in getting our drink orders & food to the table in a timely manner. Only one complaint that was had was a Porter beer that was forgotten & that same patron had a meal with room temp ( kinda cold) fries. That was quickly made up for by bringing her beer out promptly & a side order of fresh hot fries! BJ's Restaurants & Brew House's have so much of a variety of food to choose from on their menu & service at all the locations we've been to- has always been great. Seems they know how to train their service staff well too! BTW- would have given them 5 stars, but with the ""call ahead"" situation & the hospitality member ( male) we spoke with -not explaining to us their reservation policy/ requirements ( parties up to 6?) was super confusing!! Also, by ""he"" not handling or wanting to work with our request, that's why we rated it a 4.

Oh, and before they brought us our food they brought us someone else's food...geez, what was wrong with this place last night? Okay anyways, since I'm a much slower eater, I didn't finish my meal until after my friends did. We all ordered our dessert (I ordered like five minutes after they did) and it came after 20 minutes...except they didn't bring mine. My friends finished their dessert (because there was ice cream on it, they couldn't wait for me) and we were waiting another ten minutes before mine came. You would think that they should have brought them all out at the same time right? Even if mine would have taken longer to cook, they should have held off on the other two dishes so I'm not awkwardly watching them eat and vice versa when my dessert finally came.  Here's the icing on the cake though...our waitress thought it would be a good idea to give us our bills even though my dessert wasn't here yet. Why would I pay before I get my food?

This guy was on the ball, attentive, fast, thorough, friendly and super efficient. If you go to BJ's ask for Tyler.

The waitress sucked, came by once, next time we saw a waitress was when we were told ours went home (no drink refills, rude on ordering). When the food came, my plate literally got ""thrown"" down in front of me (I'll assume it was ""dropped"", but we all know what assuming does)... The meal I had was a buffalo burger, when it got to me the meat was literally crumbling apart (couldn't maintain it's ""patty"") and it was cooked solidly through... like dark brown and I ordered Med rare... very odd and off night here, actually it was shitty.

The menu is quite extensive and I think I repeated my daughters comment that it reminded us of another chain.  When I run into this kind of information overload I head straight to the soup and salad section.  I had an Asian Chicken salad which was fresh with all of the right ingredients.  My daughter had a bowl of the tortilla soup.  That was an experience worthy of a review all on its own.  It took two people to bring her soup.  One carried a white bowl with some tortilla strips piled in the bottom.  She thought the soup was really white and the strips on top.  Nope. The second person flourished the 'creamer' dish and poured the actual soup into her bowl.  Really?  Is BJ's that fancy?  I might have been under dressed. My Friend Erin S. had the Jalapeno burger which came with fries...very cold fries.  I think she liked the burger and would have liked the fries too if they had been served while still faintly warm.  Our server was extremely happy and friendly.  He gave us a Pizookie, some kind of cookie with ice cream on top, just for being newbie's to BJ's.  I don't think I'm overstating by saying we were happy it came gratis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=260

Fast forward, we ordered the chicken buffalo deep dish pizza and that's when we realized we made the biggest mistake. It was a total joke and when I brought it to our server's attention all he said was ""that's what a deep dish is supposed to look and taste like"" as if I don't know.

I would definitely come just for dessert. The service is meh! Nothing over the top and it seems like we're always looking for our server.

Alexander E.,"San Pablo, CA",355,636,830,4.0,10/26/2011,"I've heard of BJ's for a while now and I finally had a chance to try the restaurant.  The easiest comparison I can think of is The Cheesecake Factory, both in price and portion.  As expected, there was a crowd of people in the waiting area and outside with the provided pagers.  However, the real surprise was having to only wait about ten minutes for our table on a Friday night around 8pm. The place is huge and has a spacious interior with a full bar, plenty of TVs everywhere, and great brick decor.  We were seated in a small booth and given our menus and put in a drink order.  The menus are beyond intimidating and resembling a small book rather than a restaurant menu.  The place has pages and pages of plates horrible for your health with most items in the 1500-2000+ calorie range. I simply can't let myself order such a ridiculous heart clogging plate so I went with their healthy options.  I do wish they had a larger selection of plates, with only about five or six options.  I was hesitant with ordering my Maui Glazed Pork Chop over the Vegetarian Mini PIzza, but the waitress said the pork chop was a bigger entree. The food didn't take long to arrive -- ten to fifteen minutes.  My plate looked delicious with the pork chop looking especially succulent.  The pork chop was accompanied with roasted red potatoes, steamed green beans, along with grilled onions.  The pork chop was incredibly tender and had plenty of flavor with its sweet and tangy glaze without being overpowering.   The meal was appropriate in size, but perhaps sharing an appetizer would of been ideal.  Additionally, the price was incredibly reasonable, about $11 or $12 for my plate.  All in all, I'd like to come back to BJ's during their happy hour as I saw a bunch of specials and I'd definitely recommend it to those that have not tried BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=260

Our waitress told us that she was originally food running all night until they told her 5 minutes before we were seated that she had to wait on our group.   It didn't seem like she had much waitressing experience.  She never refilled our drinks, constantly forgot small requests we made (side condiments, extra napkins, etc), and only checked up on us once.  We had more help from a different waitress who was in the same area than our own. The food here is generally good except for this visit. My husband and I ordered a pizza to share.  It's the first time we've ordered it (we usually opt for soup and sandwich or other entree) and I don't think we'll ever order their pizza again.  What's with the pizza being luke warm?  There was a section that wasn't warm at all.  It was almost like it had been sitting out for awhile after it finished baking.

I let friends talk me into coming in here twice after the last fiasco.  The waitresses both times were very friendly, but I still had major issues. 1st time back-I ordered some type of Asian-inspired salad. It was good. There was a produce sticker in my salad. I didn't realize it til halfway through. Thoroughly grossed out. If they can't be bothered to remove stickers, from their produce, do they even check it over before serving to people? 2nd time back- I was with 3 friends.  The 2 who ordered the Ahi salad were fine. I had a burger and a friend of mine had buffalo wings. His came out boneless, they were supposed to be bone-in. The server realized that the kitchen had made a mistake, they were remade. My burger came out cold and passed well done. It was supposed to be medium (if I could safely eat rare hamburger, I would.) I cut into it, was disappointed, the server realized the kitchen had made another mistake, and mine was remade as well. If just one of the mistakes had been made at our table, I might be ok with it... but no. If there are issues with 50% of the food that comes from the kitchen, someone needs to fix something. This place has so much potential. It has great menu options, tasty beer, and football, but they just can't seem to get their act together.  BJ's, I'm swearing you off again until some outside source can convince me you've hired people who are actually competent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=260

First off we were meeting friends that we haven't seen in awhile and they chose here to meet at noon on a Thursday afternoon and we arrived about 11:45. We were a party of 6 and were sat in a large booth. Seat immediately which was nice.  Our server took our drink order and offered us if we wanted any appetizers and we declined since the meals looked pretty big.  I chose to have two appetizers for my meal one was a fairly new item that they were promoting was Brussels sprouts sautéed in honey with Sriracha cream sauce and the Bacon Mac n Cheese. My hubby chose the shrimp scampi pasta. And our companions chose a Blue cheese burger, fried artichoke hearts, pulled BBQ pork sandwich and a cheeseburger.  First off my Brussel sprouts were amazing just the right amount of sauté and sauce on them not too spicy. The Mac n Cheese was the twisty noodles it was served in a small dish since it was an appetizer portion that came with two pieces of toast, which was too much carbs. The Mac n Cheese was flavorful with bacon but not creamy by any means. My husband said his shrimp dish was very good and it was a very large portion.

I'm not a fan of most cheeses, one of which is cheddar, I had never tried white cheddar so I asked her if there was any way of just making the mashed potatoes without the cheese. She went the extra mile when she told me they were really good and couldn't taste the cheese much and asked if I wanted a sample before I ordered. Personally I've never really been given a sample of food at a restaurant so I pictured a spoonful of it. To my surprise she brought it in a small bowl and I loved them! I thought it was so sweet of her to let me try it before I committed! She was super attentive!

Richard B.,"Sacramento, CA",66,119,206,5.0,1/18/2016,"Came here on a Saturday evening, bjs was pretty packed. There was a wait for tables about 10-20 minutes and 10-15 people waiting in the take out order section. It was completely full. Me and my girlfriend luckily found a spot in the bar section and were able to get service in less than 3 minutes. BJs is an extremely versatile restaurant. It's great for watching sports, they have 5 large (60inch+) top quality  tvs in their bar area alone. Then there are more tvs dispersed throughout the restaurant to the point where you can view a TV from any point in the restaurant. BJs is also great for families, friends, groups, or just a bro lookin to grab a brew, very versatile, anybody and everybody comes here. The selection of food here is deep. They got steaks, burgers, salads, pasta, just to name a few. The menu is like 20 pages no lie... Eh maybe a tiny bit exaggerated. Let's talk about some of the go to items. Appetizers = fried calamari, fried to perfection and comes with ranch and marinara sauce that makes for a great starter.  The bbq brisket burger was extremely delicious, if you like bbq burgers, you'll love that. And for the rest of their extensive menu, i would say it's all above average, which is a compliment in my book. PIZOOOKIEEEEE!!!! If you have never heard of the bjs pizookie, somethin must be wrong you. This ice cream cookie combo will make your mouth melt. Top 3 pizookies according to my statistics are A) Original, chocolate chip cookie + vanilla ice cream, no you're boring. B) Salted Caramel, salted caramel is trending in life. C) Ghirardelli Triple chocolate. Moral of the story: pizookie is life. The service at this BJs was top notch. Taylor was our waiter and he's extremely friendly and attentive. There are two types of service, there's ""what do you want?"" and there's ""how can I help you?"" The service here was the latter, I'm impressed.

We sent our orders in, and, our server kept checking on us, because she knew we were waiting for a very long time. She even came to our table and apologized, telling us that we had been waiting for 35 minutes. Parties around us who were seated after us received their food ahead of us. My Mediterranean pizza, which is one of my favorite items, was cold! My parents ordered the pancake combo. We've ordered that entree in the past and have enjoyed it every time. We're used to their fluffy, delicious pancakes! Today, however, the pancakes were so thin and my mom's bacon was overcooked. The manager even stopped by our table to give his apologizes, and they gave us a free churro dessert (which was the only redeeming food we had). Like I said, I love this place and appreciated the service we received from our server, but the food was unacceptable. Something must have been off in the kitchen.

My meal was served without the side that was to accompany the dish. The server said the side would be right out....it never came out. After I ate my entire sandwich and reminded my server I still did not have the rest of my meal she went and got it for me. I understand that things happen, but the fact that the food was ordered by one employee, delivered to the table by another, and the fact I had to ask a third server about the issue shows very poor communication between employees.  I spoke to the manager about the issue and I was greatful that he comped my meal.

Chicken was on the verge of looking just barely cooked and serve-able. Waited 10 minutes for sides of ranch that were ordered with meals to be brought out. Extra entrees were brought to our table that weren't even ordered by our party. To top it all off that night we were all sick to our stomachs. Food poisoning in its greatest form!!!

Evan A.,"Benicia, CA",531,77,424,4.0,2/25/2016,"I had been to BJ's before, but this was my first time eating at this location. From what I had remembered, BJ's has always only been mediocre. I was never going to BJ's for anything other than a pizookie. Maybe they changed their menu or I had just been ordering the wrong thing, cause everything I had this time was pretty exceptional. We were there as a party of 5 on a Tuesday evening around 6:30PM. It was surprisingly pretty busy, but we were seated within 5-10 mins. Just enough time for us to grab a quick drink at the bar! We ordered some avocado eggrolls and mozarella sticks to start with. Both were absolutely delicious! The avocado was super fresh and creamy, and the dipping sauce it came with was amazing! Some of us were even dipping our cheese sticks in it! The cheese sticks were also fryed to perfection. Very cheesy and just enough cruchy. Pretty much everything I could ask for when it comes to mozarella sticks. For my entree I decided to go with the deep dish baked ziti. They could have done a little better on this, but it was still pretty good nonetheless. I would have liked maybe a little bit more cheese, but they did really well with the penne noodles and the various meats (pepperoni, sausage, etc) they threw in with it. There were also some random spaghetti noodles in the dish which was kind of weird, but I don't feel like it altered the flavor of the dish in anyway. I also ordered the honey sriracha brussel sprouts. Fried brussel sprouts with a creamy honey sriracha sauce?! What more could you ask for?? The best part was the crunchyness of the brussel sprouts dipped in the sauce which was just the right amount of sweet and spicy! They could have used a little more sauce either in the dish or on the side, but I would still definitely order these again! For dessert we shared a pizookie sampler with a chocolate chunk, peanut butter, and salted caramel pizookie. They took a little while to bring these out after we ordered them due to the kitchen being slammed with lots of pizzas and pizookies according to our waitress. We were so excited when they finally came, we dug in right away. They were all good, but the salted caramel one was definitely my favorite! It would have been nice if they noted that there were chocolate chips with the salted caramel one, cause I might have just ordered my own! I wanted the salted caramel one but was also craving chocolate, so since I didn't know the salted caramel one came with chocolate, I agreed to share the sampler to guarantee me some chocolate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=60

Diane L.,"Vallejo, CA",84,68,12,1.0,4/2/2015,"I usually enjoy BJ's Brewery in other areas (Woodland Hills, Livermore, etc) and made a special point to take a out of town friend who enjoys beer for a meal here. We traveled 20 miles specifically for this restaurant. Before we left I uploaded and used their app to get ""priority seating"". By the apps approximation our table would be ready in 40 minutes (Friday evening, so that's fine). We left in time to arrive 5 minutes before that time. When we got there, I was told it would be another 25 minutes.  And we would be in line with everyone else (non-app users). It turned out to be an additional 40 minutes. So, the app was useless and I had to remind the hostess we were there at least two times. Which stressed me out.  So, we are finally seated and I tell a manager(?) what happened and he seemed sympathetic but said it's their computer program and WiFi. He did nothing to make the situation better. When our server came by she said she'd be right back. She was back 15 minutes later and asked us if we needed anything else - because she thought we were done eating!!!! Once she realized what happened she apologized and took our orders. I ordered a steak, with a Caesar salad. My husband ordered a burger. The food took another 15 minutes. The salad came out first. Then literally 2 minutes later our food came out. I let the server know our salad just arrived and she said sorry and left. What?! My rib-eye was undercooked on one side and medium well on the other. It was incredibly tough to cut. The roasted asparagus was impossible to eat because the ends were like wood. The whole experience was awful. And no one would help us make the situation better. I don't yell at staff, but maybe I should start. Because being calm but direct got me nowhere with this uncaring staff and their careless attitude. I will not be going back to this location.

Kim T.,"Sacramento, CA",32,270,,1.0,5/30/2013,"I usually don't mind coming to BJ's with a larger group of people or for an appetizer--there's tons to choose from, something for each kind of diet or drink preference. The food is pretty good and consistent at all the locations usually. They have a nice selection of small plates so you can try a few things. Their beers have improved quite a bit from maybe 5 years back but it's sad that the staff isn't more in the know about the basics of their beers. We made reservations for our large group and showed up 5 minutes early, that's when they informed us there was no reservation. We had called the reservation in more than 24 hours in advance. They weren't apologetic about it at all and the funny thing was that this was the SECOND time this has happened at this location for our large group reservation. Not a huge deal as far as getting a table, only about a ten minute wait. We waited on a few people in our group so we waited a few minutes to order. If we knew it would be another half an hour before anyone asked us about ordering again, we wouldn't have waited. Our server seemed to vanish into the back each time she left our table.  By the time our server took our order, the lunch rush was gone and our server was still never anywhere to be found. She was very friendly when she did show up and was on the ball to drop our tab off, but that's it. Our drinks took forever to receive, we waited almost an hour for food and were at BJ's for two hours because of how slow everything was. If there was some issue going on in the kitchen, communication would have been all we required. Instead, we were left for very long periods of time and even the guy who looked like he was probably the manager was walking around and never said anything to our table (or any others for that matter) or asked how things were going. We were all searching for our server so we had to have looked like maybe we required some attention. As this visit was frustrating for everyone, we will definitely find another spot for our work gathering next time. With so many options out there, it really is crucial to have servers who are on their game or at least honest enough to share that there might be a delay. There was no reason that today's lunch should have turned out to be one of the worst from the time we walked in the door.

I ordered the salmon with quinoa. I have had the dish 3-4 times since it was added to the menu. The fish was over cooked, the aparagus were chopped stems with two tips included in the bowl, yuck! The portion was comparable to the lunch size serving and quinoa was lacking flavor. The other dish we ordered was the ribeye steak. It should have been cooked medium , warm pink center!? But was basically rare. They offered to take the dishes back, fill it with another order, ect. The waitress told me they go through cooks all the time.

It's 3 stars because although this time was an epic fail, usually things are pretty damn good on other visits.  My meal was late. I mean really late. Another's meal was even later, and wrong. Twice! Another's meal was supposed to be mild and came out spicy. Our server was doing her very best to wrangle the situation in between us and the kitchen. She was a gem. The kitchen, however, needs to be fired. Seriously. As an aside, we've never had a bad time there before, so I know this was just an anomaly. Well, more like a cataclysm. Oddly enough, I'm pretty amicable about dining out, having worked in fast food and other restaurants before. I know how much work goes into a service. But today... It kept getting later and later and later. Finally my food arrived, but the diner across from me was still waiting. And all she ordered was a stupid calzone. When it arrived, it was wrong. Sent it back. Waited another 25 minutes and it finally arrived after everyone else was finished. AND IT WAS WRONG AGAIN! She called the server over and said ""I'm done"" and handed it to her. Meanwhile, another's soup was too spicy after she asked for mild. The server was frustrated too, but she was very attentive and concerned. Also the manager came by and apologized. Here's where I shocked myself: I spoke up. I mean, REALLY spoke up. Like I said, I usually don't make waves, but today was ridiculous. My opinionated outburst even prompted a very pleased response from my significant other, since I never do that. Usually it's her job. I guess I was paying more attention than we both thought. That and the fact that I wanted to bring bit up to the staff before they forgot.

Ordered the brushetta - it was ehh, the wings (hot and bbq) - yummy, and the mahi/shrimp tacos with extra chipa and avacado cream sauce - pretty good.

Andrew W.,"San Francisco, CA",438,431,823,3.0,5/3/2011,"Been to this BJ so many times. Service just depends on how busy they are. Usually I come on a Friday night or on the weekend and it is packed. Wait time is 30 minutes or more, which isn't too bad if Pet-Co is open. The servers are fairly attentive although I rarely get my water refilled. I always get the same dish-- the burger melt and end with a pizookie.  What I recommend:  -- Burger Melt on a French roll -- Pizookie Trio or just the regular Pizookie",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=320
Kali H.,"Dayton, OH",2,58,,4.0,1/15/2014,"We loved coming here for lunch or dinner. My favorite meal was the ""Field of Greens"" salad and possibly a chocolate chip pizookie afterwards.   I took off a star because service can be downright slow and God awful if you go on a busy night. One would say ""Well they're jam packed no wonder service is slow"". And you'd be right but waiting an hour and a half for food for a table of five is a bit much.  Oh and if you have a LARGE PARTY tell them separate checks from the get go because they will not separate when you're trying to settle up.

Jabez J.,"Oakland, CA",21,115,48,2.0,8/31/2014,"In the past we have truly enjoyed this place but for some reason they had an off day from the waitress that we had initially to the food. We were being taken out to dinner and the person wanted Outback Steakhouse but we assured them that BJs would be better.  Everyone was disappointed and we paid over $100 for the food. Our first waitress seemed highly distracted in which we later discovered that she was due to go home in about thirty minutes. Our second waitress was great. The food was bland and lacked flavor (i.e spinach and artichoke dip and peach and pecan cobbler), the loaded mashed potatoes were not loaded only had cheese and the waitress had to bring the other things to actually make it loaded from bacon and sour cream to chives, the ribs were dry and the roasted brussels sprouts were extremely hard.  Now why would the salads which should come with the meals come by itself and before the appetizers? Is that normal? Well it happened. The other dishes (i.e buffalo wings) and drinks were ok.  We ordered two desserts and was disappointed with them as well as stated above.  We profusely apologized for choosing BJs over Outback but still hope that this was merely a fluke.

Luckily we noticed the lunch specials because I had never been to BJs for lunch before. I got the Unlimited Soup and Salad lunch special: Chicken Tortilla soup and Caesar salad. My boyfriend got the Half Sandwich Half Soup lunch special: Clam Chowder soup and Grilled Chicken Club sandwich with Crispy Thin fries.  We were satisfied with everything. They bring out a bowl of tortilla chips and avocado for the soup first and then pour the rest of the Chicken Tortilla soup into the bowl. I really liked that because the tortilla chips were crunchy for as long as possible. Great touch! The Caesar salad was good. Big portions for both....I couldn't ask for refills even though they were unlimited :( I was so full! My boyfriend's sandwich and soup were good. The Clam Chowder is surprisingly delicious! It's a creamy but light soup and I actually prefer that over thick and heavy clam chowders. The sandwich was great. Greasy (but yummy) and toasted bread and the sandwich was very filling even though it was only a half. Fries were good--we love our fries crispy. Great service as well!

The food is not healthy, but it's also not really super interesting or original or delicious. I mean, I guess don't get me wrong. I am really glad that it's in vacaville. It's just not super exciting. To me, it's the kind of place I'd go if everyone else wants to go there, but it will never be the first on my list. I would never pick it of my own volition. As far as restaurants go, Vacaville really just does not have a super ton to offer. It's getting better. But really, for the most part, its a lot of BJ's, Chevy's, Chili's Olive Garden, chain sort of places. And frankly, I'd always rather eat at home and cook for myself then go to any of those. But, that's just me. Some people really love it. I know people who go to BJ's weekly or monthly. So I am going to go with a solid three stars.

My friend called ahead before we arrived and got a table within 5 minutes of a 20 minute wait. Awesome! I ordered two things: a Watermelon and Feta Salad and a Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread Appetizer. The Watermelon and Feta Salad did not look like the picture I saw online. It lacked a lot of watermelon. And the feta cheese was VERY salty. I took a bunch of the salty cheese off my salad. Gross! At least the vinaigrette was tasty. The Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread also did not look that great like in the picture on the menu. I mean, I know food often does not look like the picture, but come on! There was barely any goat cheese on my pizza. :( It didn't have much in the way of roasted veggies either... But it did have a lot of basil pesto sauce on top. But holy moly! The Pizookie was so GOOD! Warm chocolate chunk cookie with cool ice cream? That was the best part of dinner! I'll only come back for a Pizookie. It was so amazingly delicious!

We weren't feeling the usual Olive Garden and other places close by, so we drove further down to see what else they have to offer. I remember in the past that my mother has never been to a BJ's restaurant and coincidentally there was BJ's right ahead of us. Perfect. My mother asked what are BJ's specialties and I told her that they are known for their deep dish pizzas and pizookies. Since it was just the two of us and getting a personal size pizza isn't as fun as ordering a large deep dish to share with a group, we settled on ordering the lunch entrees. We both ordered the Chicken a la Fresca and it was spectacular. However, the rice was on the salty side, but the chicken was grilled to perfection. My mother and I agreed that the ratatouille was the highlight - nicely made, especially the zucchinis. Of course, you can't leave without having a pizookie. Our entree was only approximately 500 calories, so there was absolutely no excuse to be guilty about a little indulgence at the end (regardless, there should be no excuse in skipping the pizookie, period). We chose to share the Red Velvet pizookie and it was a major sugar rush (in a good way). I could've sworn the other pizookies I've had in the past were a bit thicker than what we had. My mother's first overall experience was great and she was satisfied.

They said it was $7 but when we arrived, we had to wait 20 or so minutes at the bar and the bartender corked it for us for free (maybe because we also ordered one mixed drink? not sure). Lovely! They are currently doing a special 2 for $20 deal in which you get a salad or soup each for two people, a medium pizza to share (ANY of their pizzas!), and any pizookie to share for dessert. I love this deal. Ive gone twice so far since they started promoting it and hope I can go again before it ends. You dont need a coupon, and I believe they stop it somewhere around Nov 13th or so.

We were hopeful that this was a good indication that the food was worth waiting for. Unfortunately, the food was downright awful. The fish and chips and french fries were definitely fried in old oil that imparted a bitter after-taste to an extremely greasy and bland tasting fish. The absence of flavor extended to the burgers and fettuccini alfredo. The alfredo was a boring and clumpy mess. This was a disaster and definitely a waste of our time and money. We could not bring ourselves to finish any of the food so we're going to rush over and grab a burger from our favorite fast food chain so that we can try to erase the lingering unpleasant and unsatisfactory experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=360

Overall the food was good so definitely 3 stars there.  It's nothing special, typical chain restaurant.  Good for lunch specials and happy hours but skip for dinner and cross your fingers you're there on a night when servers are on their A-game.  Plenty of better chain options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=360

Maybe I should have tried something a bit more exciting than a turkey burger, but after combing through the ridiculously large menu for 10 minutes, I was overwhelmed & just wanted to order. We started with the ahi poke, which was good & fresh. Pretty much everything else on the appetizer menu was deep fried. I guess that shouldn't be much of a surprise for this type of a chain restaurant.

Nicole C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",502,523,674,1.0,6/19/2011,"By far the worst BJ's that I have ever dropped money at. The food, is generally the same across the board at these places, as it is a chain so this review is based on ""service"" or lack thereof.  Decided to go here on a Saturday, did a call ahead at 7pm while we were down the street shopping at the outlets. The little girl on the phone told me that the wait was about 40 minutes long and to show up within that time.  So we showed up at around 35 minutes after we did our ""call ahead"" reservation. There were a lot of people waiting, which is fine. We got up to the hostess station and she handed us one of those buzzer's and told us it would be an additional 15 minutes.  Ok, fine. I can understand that. 25 minutes after we were waiting outside, and (waiting an additional 25 minutes with two toddlers in a crowded area where they are unable to run around) is not cool considering we called ahead.  The Emo looking seating hostess told me that they were clearing our table and getting it set up, so the rest of our party came into the restaurant to wait. ANOTHER 25 freaking minutes passes and the kids are starving and restless I go and tell the seating hostess that it does not take 25 freaking minutes to clear a table and set it and if the wait was going to end up being an hour and 40 minutes they should have just told us that when we called because we could have most definitely gone elsewhere OR driven home, ordered a pizza and eaten at home all within the time we were waiting for a damn table.  So another 10 minutes goes by and we get seated. The ""wonderful"" seating hostess tried to say that they had a party of 40 there that they had to clear up. I told her she was full of it because when we got there an hour before there was no one on the far side of the restaurant and the tables were all clean and set up for guests. Her ""story"" did not make any sense.  Being in a service industry, I would suggest that the management of this ""establishment"" tell his workers to be HONEST about wait times and then not try to shovel BS stories to keep people from getting upset. All that does it make people even more mad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=380
Lena K.,"Petaluma, CA",27,7,,2.0,3/18/2012,"I have been to this restaurant twice since moving to Davis, CA.  My first visit was satisfactory, but not great.  The restaurant was really cold throughout the meal, even though we weren't seated by the door.  The server was friendly and I liked that they give you free tastes of beer before you decide to buy one.  Their Oktoberfest beer was nice, not much to it though.  I ordered a personal deep dish pizza and it was fine, typical sports bar/brewery fare. The send time I visited the restaurant was for my friends birthday.  We were waiting for a few people when we first sat down so I think the wait staff was not expecting to serve us right away.  However, when we were ready to order drinks it was difficult to find our server.  After ordering drinks we waited even longer for the server to come to our table so we could order our food.  This was a different server but friendly enough.  The food came fairly quickly and everything was correct. I ordered a deep dish pizza again, the meat one, on whole wheat.  It was pretty good, but again, typical sports bar fare.  I tried the seasonal Abbey brew and it was very watery, so I shared the Jeremiah Red with my friend, which was better.  My friend received the complimentary birthday Pizookie, which was tasty and a nice touch, and some other people in our party ordered dessert.  One dessert was brought out quickly but another one was forgotten.  We sat at the table for probably 10 minutes before we were able to flag down someone and have the dessert brought out.  Finally our server came by to give the check and offered to split the checks, a nice touch also. Lastly, I brought home some of the deep dish pizza and noticed that the box says ""still the best pizza"" on the side.  Sorry BJ's, but have you heard of Old Chicago Pizza in Petaluma (sonoma county)?  That is by far the best deep dish pizza I have ever had and I think you can learn something from them as far as pizza goes. Bottom line: friendly wait staff, average american pizza, watery to ""alright"" beer, cold temperature, often slow service, wouldn't chose this restaurant for my birthday celebration even if the pizookie is tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=380

They stock a full bar and BJ's has their own line of beer and house made root-beer. The food isn't bad and the portions are big. I have been content with all of the items I've tried off the menu. The service is friendly and normally good. The restaurant could be a bit cleaner, sometimes I will find a napkin or bits of food in the corner of the booth. I normally order a grilled burger melt with the crispy-thin fries, excellent french fries. You have to make sure to save room for their famous pizookie. Basically a pizookie is a hot out of the oven cookie topped with ice cream. I normally share a party platter with the table, it's a mixture of cookie flavors the size of a large pizza. My favorite flavors are white chocolate macadamia nut and oreo. They serve food and drinks in the bar up until midnight. I enjoy any place that serves customers later then the majority.

BJ's looked interesting in that beer & pub grub is something dudes always like, but BJ's proved to be no exception to the abundant mediocrity available in Vacaville. Bj's offers a decent variety of its own beer on tap that would seem to talk the talk of a craft/ micro brew, but the flavors just don't walk the walk. I had their brown ale, stout, & porter, in that order. One of the other dudes also started with the brown ale. He commented that there was a hint of urine in the flavor profile, seriously he said ""urine."" I noticed that my brown ale smelled like the iron in hemoglobin, seriously it had that ferrous blood smell. Not a good start when the first round smells like blood & tastes like piss. We both, naturally, sent ours back & moved onto the stout. Both the stout & the porter basically tasted like they should but in an indistinct, less flavorful, Budweiser kind-of-way. Maybe the flavor is dialed down to appeal more to the masses who actually enjoy Budweiser. The food was ok. We had nachos, chicken sliders, pulled pork sliders, & seasoned fries. Big servings all around for appetizer dishes. The nachos had heaping amounts of toppings & were pretty good. The chicken sliders were bland. The pulled pork sliders had decent flavor but still a bit bland compared to really good pulled pork. The seasoned fries were ok & were gobbled down quickly thanks to beer induced munchiness. All other things considered, BJ's might have rated 2 stars but the service was outstanding. The place was packed & it was very busy, but the entire staff was friendly, attentive, & on top of things.

Matt H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",23,22,,3.0,5/4/2014,"Avocado egg rolls get a five star. Most of the other appetizers are just kind of ok, typical bar food. Can't really tell you how the main dishes are because it's a brewery (kind of)...I go there to drink, not get filled up on food. But the main reason you should be going here is for beer, right? Well tell me BJ's, how come every time I come here and try to order beer your servers tell me, 'We don't have that right now. We're out of stock of that beer too. Oh yeah, I'll check but I think we're out of that one too.' I end up drinking beer the servers push on me that I really didn't want.

Mellissa D.,"Vacaville, CA",227,49,48,4.0,8/9/2014,"Today we are here for a pre-birthday lunch for my hubby.  BJ's is above average brew house food. I like that they offer a healthy menu, but let's be honest here, you aren't here for the baked salmon....you are here for the avocado egg rolls, the deep dish pizza, and the beer. They brew their own beer, root beer and cream soda! One of my favorite drinks from the bar is the Irish Root Beer. It's life changing hahaha. Their menu is constantly changing and adding fun, seasonal offerings. It's really hard to get to the main menu because the appetizers are so good.  Today, we tried the watermelon mojito, the carne asada fries, and the fritos nachos from the seasonal menu. The mojito was too sweet, but had fresh watermelon in it, which was nice. The asada fries were our favorite and I hope they make it to the regular menu forever. The fritos nachos were good, but I thought it could have used a little bit more chips for all the toppings, as well as a lot less sour cream on top. We also had their Tatonka stout which is a little sweeter and toastier than a Guinness. Their Berry Burst Cider is excellent and refreshing. It's gluten free for those that need to watch out for that like me. BJs also offers gluten free pizza and an entire gluten free menu. The pizza is one of the better gluten free pizzas I've had, as long as the crust is crispy and not undercooked. The pizookie is the real reason everyone comes here. They are all amazing and they even have a gluten free chocolate chip pizookie. Save room for it!!!! Service is almost always great. We have had, in the past, a couple bad experiences, but management has bent over backwards to make it right. It's pretty loud so don't go there expecting to have a quiet conversation. There are several  TVs with a variety if sports games on at all times. Overall a good spot for a casual meal and drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=380
Scott M.,"El Sobrante, CA",2,14,,1.0,1/10/2015,"I have been to a number of BJ's throughout the Bay Area and I have to say I had one of the worst experiences I have had in a restaurant period at this location. I have never really had issues with service at any other BJ's but for some reason the service here is atrocious. We went on a Saturday night around 8:30pm. It was relatively busy but I wouldn't say they were slammed. In our section there were a couple of waitresses but for some reason neither of them would acknowledge us. We sat and sat and Sat hoping that one of them would stop by our table but neither of them did. They seated a couple after us who got serviced before us and was seated right behind our table. When the waitress proceeded to take their order I flagged her down and asked her if she would take our order and get us some water. Her response to me was that it wasn't her section. When she came back with the other tables waters and spoke to her again and she begrudgingly took our order. We had been sitting for 20 MINUTES at this point. The waitress really acted like we were bothering her. When we got our food another 30 mins later, the food we usually get from other BJ's didn't taste or look anything we had got from there before. I honestly like BJ's as a restaurant and I frequent the one in Concord a lot because it is near my job. I will NEVER go back to this location again  unless I am feeling depressed about myself and would like to feel like a second class citizen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=420

Twenty-eight bucks?!? Really!??! Okay, so it must be good, right? Uh. No. Well, maybe it is good, but I don't think they finished our order. I had to return to the counter twice. First, they forgot one of our order of fries. Then I realized they'd forgotten my coleslaw and returned again.  For my trouble, they offered me a drink. But I had already ordered two ginormous (really, do we all need that much soda??) drinks, so that was useless. And it costs them, what, 5 cents? I was, well, insulted by this paltry attempt to give me a ""good customer experience.""  The pork sandwich was simply pulled pork on a soggy bun. I think it was supposed to have other stuff on it. My husband was to the point of not caring, so if they forgot something on his sliders, he didn't mention it. I also noticed he only ate one of them, and I also threw out half of my sandwich.  This is my second experience at BJs and the first, at the Roseville location, was equally unremarkable. Actually, now that I think back, I think I found one of the appetizers so gross I wouldn't eat it.  In general: Quantity over quality seems to be the rule of the day, and their service is somewhere between mediocre and disastrous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=420

Living in Northern California, we now have one in Vacaville that I can go to anytime I want, and I want to often. I love BJ's BBQ Chicken Pizza. It's off-the-chart good. All their pizza's are delicious. I've tried many of their salads and have ordered often. The Sourdough Burger is sooooo good and those seasoned fries never last because I have to eat them first. I'm only one third of the way through the menu because I have to repeat items because I love them. And, one of my favorite desserts anywhere is the apple crisp with ice cream. . . OMG. Another true favorite is their fish tacos. I think they have the best fish tacos I have ever experienced and I've tried many. Since I have been to the Vacaville BJ's at least 20+ times, I have always had excellent service, excellent food and and enjoyable experience.

I can't really say that the taste is different, but I guarantee that you'll find the texture to be different. Someone in our group ordered the Dark Cherry, and that was terrible. I'm not a fan of cough syrup, so I really disliked that drink.  Our waiter was very pleasant, and we ended up getting three complimentary personal pizookies in addition to the huge pizookie we ordered.  I also really love the environment.

The 13 of us were able to get a nice table in a corner after calling ahead. I was surprised to see how busy they still were at 2-3PM on a weekday. We were told by one of the May college grads who lives in Vacaville that the place is busy all the time.  I had their refillable clam chowder (it was good but salty) and Caesar salad (you get refills on both) which had a tad too much dressing but was good (no anchovies) :(  Lovely sister had the meatloaf lunch sandwich which was huge. It had a thick slice of meatloaf over French bread, topped with a scoop of mashed potato and smothered with way too much sauce. I couldn't believe she was eating that, and obviously couldn't finish.  Hubby had their crispy chicken sandwich which he said was 'good and different"". Our waiter was one of the nicest waiters I've ever encountered at a chain restaurant.

Whenever there's a retirement or other occasion, they seem to pick either Chevy's or BJ's to celebrate. I'm not a Chevy's fan, so I was glad we went here. The most memorable part of our meal was that someone in the back of the restaurant collapsed, and we got to see the chiseled fire department make a very daring rescue. Mmm. Other than that, BJ's remained... well, what you'd expect from here. The happy hour specials were ok ($1 off beers and cocktails), but our server was spacey and kept insisting we had to go order them up at the bar to get the discount. Finally she relented and got the discounted ones for us herself. She was also kind of hover-y and didn't seem too thrilled that we weren't ordering more food and booze, as well as that the table wasn't full thanks to some last-minute no-shows. That said, there was something on the menu (food and alcohol-wise) that made everyone happy in terms of personal tastes, budget, and caloric value, which confirmed my suspicion that BJ's is not a bad choice for a large group of potentially picky eaters, even though it might not be most people's first choice for a nice night out.

Kimberly M.,"Vallejo, CA",25,25,111,3.0,1/11/2009,"just came back from this place it was really nice and the atmosphere wasn't that bad either. I would really come back to this place for the good brew's and for the huge pizza's  it was pretty full that night which kinda worried me because I heard that the wait can be kinda irritating but thankfully we only had to wait like 3 to 5 minutes. so when we got to our seats my friends and I already kinda knew what we wanted because we looked on their website before hand. so we didn't waste time that much looking at the menu but their was more pictures in the menu then the website haha. so I was really really hungry tonight like I didn't eat anything all day today so man was I soo ready for the Great white. This pizza was really delicious, it was a white pizza so it had a cream sauce instead of marinara sauce. I believe it was alfredo sauce and it also had roasted garlic bits and mushrooms and chunks of tomatoes which was really good. The pizza crust was really good as well it wasn't too hard or too chewy it was just right.  I also ordered the Angus beef pot roast sandwich which was also really good as well. it was a slice of garlic bread toped with the pot roast which was super tender and moist. Then on top of the roast was a good scoop of garlic mashed potatoes and gravy with a side of steamed veggies.  it was so delicious. It seriously cured my hunger. After dinner it was the all incredible pizookie. for free because it was my friends birthday so which made the bill even better haha =]  so all in all it was a pretty good experience the bar was fully stocked and for some reason I really liked the openness of the whole room so my friends and I didn't have to watch our volume haha. Our waitress seemed like she was ready to get off so I was kind of hesitant to ask her a question about the menu but other then that I had a really good time. this would be a good place to take a couple of the guys and girls to have a beer or two and have their pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=440

Carol P.,"Sacramento, CA",3076,824,879,2.0,8/28/2007,"I ate at the BJ's in Elk Grove, and I fell in love with their Chicago-style pizza.  The price was decent and the crust was thick, flakey, and buttery.  So I was totally looking forward to having a slice (or two or three) on the way back to Sac from a day of biking in the bay area.  We started off our meal with the ""together at last"" appetizer: hot artichoke dip and bruschetta.  Do your stomach a favor, and just order extra bread at the beginning.  I could have lived on this bread alone.  Pan fried to perfection and excellent with both the fresh tomato bruschetta and rich artichoke dip.   Service was good, although I wonder if it was because we were the only ones sitting at the bar (a rarity at any chain restaurant).  Actually, every staff member I came across was very polite and professional.  Our bartender kept giving me samples of their specialty beers on tap until I found one that I liked (the hefeweizen).  They do sell a ""sampler"" but as my bartender pointed out, ""you just want to get drunk for free"".  How observant.  Good selection of beers to go with the big menu selection. Oh, yeah, the pizza...not good.  It wasn't anything like I remembered.  The crust was a thick soggy mess.  I don't think the dough was baked through all the way.  But we didn't complain.  I guess the fact that we were so hungry and I got free beer (so to speak), that we let it slide.     Sorry, BJ's in Vacaville, I just don't think I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=440

We started off with avocado egg rolls - amazing!!  I'm not usually a fan of warm avocado, but these rolls were to die for.  The sweet-sour dipping sauce was perfect.   Then hubby and I shared the Santa Fe salad, his portion with grilled chicken, mine with blackened salmon.  More avocado, tangy dressing, yummy chicken and fish.  The  salmon portion was huge;  I took it to work for breakfast. He had the house-made black cherry soda (yummy, but sweet) and I had the Jeremiah Red beer.  Excellent beer, not bitter. All in all a pretty good restaurant experience.  Service was a bit slow, which was acknowledged; I knocked a star off my review. We'll definitely stop in again and I'll probably just have the ribs.  The watermelon/feta salad looked so good, but there was just no room. Parking can be problematic and I bet the weekends can be a zoo.  They have house-brewed root beer and cream soda, along with lots of other non-alcoholic drinks for the teetotalers out there.

The food is decent for a chain restaurant. I love the Avocado Egg Rolls as the avocado and cream cheese makes this appetizer so smooth and rich tasting. I've tried the Seasame Chicken Salad which isn't that authentic tasting. I would not order the salad again. The Sante Fe Salad was better with the avocado and tortilla chips. The salad had similar flavors to the Halibut Fish Taco dish. I really like the Halibut Fish Tacos. You receive tacos, red and black corn tortilla chips, avocado cream sauce and a fire-roasted tomato salsa. The taco is really good as the halibut is in a panko-crust. Yum!! The taco is also stuffed with cabbage, cartos, cilantro, and red onions. I wish there were more tacos since two seems a bit on the skimpy side. For dessert, you have to get the Pizookie. Your choice of chocolate, white chocolate macademia nut, peanut butter, or oatmeal cookie is freshly baked and topped with vanilla ice cream. You can also get a half of tow different cookie batters. The white chocolate macademia nut is soo delicious! The cookie is sweet and the ice cream makes the dessert so much better. It's definitely worth the $5.

After waiting for our names to be called, the wait time was about 25 minutes, that was ok. Once we sat at the table about 15 minutes later a waiter came and he took our drink order, two tropical teas only to get regular teas,  and a Calamari appetizer order and said he would be back to take our main order. This is when the problems started. After another 10 minute wait our drinks came and then he took our main order. We ordered a Pork Chop Dinner with a chicken Soup and a Creole Tilapia. Another 15 minutes went by and the Calamari Apps came to the table. My wife and I ate the appetizer because we had been waiting now from the start over 45 minutes for our first taste of food. Another 20 minutes go by and our main dishes came to the table. Both plates looked as if they had been almost dropped as the food on both plates were all shoved to one side. I was a little upset and wanted to say something, but the waiter was nowhere to be found. During this time frame for the next 30 minutes, no soup was ever brought out and none of our drinks were refilled. Finally the waiter came back to the table to see if we needed anything, and I explained that we never got our soup and that been waiting for a refill as well. He said he would go get a refill and said nothing about the soup. This is when it got even more worse. after another 15 minute wait, the waiter shows up to the table with one refill, not two, but one refill. and then sets down our soup. The soup was 20 minutes after we had already finished our main dinner. The dinner cost us $44.18 and it was not worth one penny of the bill. The service was terrible and the food was late, cold and a mess on the plate.

The significant other ordered the meatball sandwich with wedge fries. I got water but later decided I wanted to try the pumpkin ale they were showcasing. It was not to be had as our waitress was nowhere to be found. By the time she came back around I had changed my mind. The food didn't take long to come out and my parmesan chicken was decent. The mashed potatoes were the consistency of powdered potatoes and tasted like glue. The lettuce in the salad was watered down which is never good. The meatball sandwich was surprisingly very good and huge! The sauce they use was very flavorful as was the meat and the garlic roll. The potato wedges were crispy and well seasoned.

Anyways, this place is pretty standard for your chain restaurant/brewery.  Nice plasma screens showing different sports games all around the place - damn, warriors lost :( - the decor was pretty standard, wood with sports stuff all around, but I did REALLY like the mirrors that they had around the room and in the bathroom, they were just really pretty :)  Anyways, the food, pretty standard.  I had the jambalaya but it wasn't spicy enough but the bartender did pour a pretty good grey goose martini a tad bit on the expensive side though, especially in vacaville...the only complaint I really had about my drink was the fact that there was pieces of ice floating around in it.  Granted, it was only like two pieces, but still....a martini should be clear with no ice only chilled!  Again, not a big deal but sue me, I'm a purist....or something, ok fine I'm just picky :)  Three for standard fare, nice decor, relatively good service, and awesome mirrors!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=540

We were on our way back from a road trip and planned to meet up with our friends--they suggested BJ's--I don't know if they usually like this kind of food, I don't like chains. It was 7pm and parking was impossible (someone stole our spot even) and then the wait to be seated for 4 people was 30 minutes.  Found seats at the bar but it wasn't wiped down for about 30 minutes and the bartenders were too busy to be attentive to us.  Let me just say that I hate polyester fabric napkins--I would rather have toilet paper. They don't absorb anything and they slip off your lap. Anyway, this place uses them. After we finally ordered our food, the service was better; the food came and the bartender checked on us and refilled our drinks and asked about dessert. The food was okay--average stuff at average prices. The noise level was high and you couldn't hear past the person you were sitting next to. I was ready to get out of there after the 1.5 hours!

The second time, my colleague and I sat there for 15 minutes before our waitress even came over. She finally took our order and then we waited for 45 minutes with no food. The waitress kept saying our food would be up soon, but it never showed, The manager came over and apologized and comped the meal, but it was painfully slow. It was hands down the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. To this day, i don't think it was the server's fault, though.

In the end, I felt scammed out of my money. Our food came out very slowly and when any food would finally be brought to our designated buffet table, our party of 40+ people consumed it in seconds. It should have been obvious that a party of 40+ people can't survive off of two pizzas and a measly tray of buffalo wings! When we asked the waiters why our food was coming out so slowly, they told us that it was the managements decision to bring the food out at such a slow pace... This was the most aggravating part of the whole dinner... We had 40+ hungry people paying $20 each and they were starving us by purposely not bringing out food! Conclusion: NEVER get pawned into a ""buffet style"" or catered meal at BJs. If anything, avoid the whole place all together.

He read me off two beers and I chose the wingnut I think it was. I thought it was interesting that it took another 5 minutes for a food runner (not the waiter) to bring me my drink. The waiter then took another 5 minutes to come by to ask if we had time to look over the menu, of course we have we have been here for over 15 minutes by now. I ordered a 9"" deep dish pizza and the girlfriend got the buffalo burger. Granted I know deep dish pizza should take a while to bake and thats ok, so 25 minutes later (yes I was watching the time) a food runner comes out with my pizza and her burger. My so called deep dish pizza was more like a thick pan crust pizza I was not very thrilled to say the least, that was by no means a deep dish pizza.

The inside of BJ's is huge and totally in tune with the sports environment with a TV in every direction. I was disappointed that they changed the basketball game to racing. Ugh. Playoffs are my favorite. Although the Giants game was on so it wasn't too bad.  I like the fact that BJ's has a pairing section for their beers, which is really important to me because I never know if a beer would go with the food I am eating. I ordered the Harvest Hefeweizen for the BJ's Cobb Salad. My sister ordered the Onion Strings for the appetizer. The rest of my family ordered sandwiches and salads, and my sweet daughter ordered her pizza.  I don't care what the reviews say here, our service was quick. The food did take awhile, but after seeing what was on our plate I can see the delay. Their Cobb Salad was delicious! Every bite there was dressing and an assortment of croutons, turkey, or bacon in each bite. Nothing was dry and everything tasted exactly the way I wanted it to.

As we stood there, I watched the slowness of the restaurant. I counted a total of FIVE tables that had to be waited. Of the five, one of the tables had FOUR workers visit it, grabbing only a plate or two, and a couple napkins and cups (mind you, they weren't stacking the cups, which of course would sound more efficient) Anyway, finally, the bussers start bussing, but take a million light years to complete.  When we were FINALLY seated, our server SPILLS our drinks, one being a strawberry lemonade (can you say STICKY?!?!). Only ONE worker ran over and handed us napkins as I tried to dry myself off. A busser nearby didn't give a crap and was oblivious to what had happened. I mean I felt bad for our server, but if you can't hold your drinks on the tray, just set the tray on the table!

Sure, I have to wait sometimes, but let me let you in on a little secret.  You can sit at the booths and tables up in the bar area and get great service, full menu available.  So while I wait for my name to be called, I scope out the bar area.  If a table opens up, I just jump on it. The service has always been awesome, but maybe I've just been blessed with amazing servers.  It doesn't hurt that I am super cool and treat everyone really nice (JK). Love the Avacado Egg Rolls, screaming good.  Love the sliders, just remember that they don't come with Mayo, you have to ask for it.  The stuffed potato would fill up anyone!  When you look up ginormous in the dictionary, there is a picture of one of their potatoes.

That's not always a bad thing but when everything (with the exception of pizza) can be found on a coco's dinner menu....it's just not an exciting menu. ***please note:  I'm not comparing quality of coco's to bjs. just the items on the menu.*** I was tore between 2 or 3 stars. And honestly, I still am. I liked the fries, onion strings, root beer and pizookie. The service is decent, a little on the pushy/rushed side, but decent. The atmosphere is still fun and lively...... It's just that the dishes as a whole are nothing special. Other then it being decent, I still havent found any reason in particular that I would want to come back here.

Duaine F.,"Norton, KS",0,19,17,4.0,6/5/2010,"Ten (10) of us ate at BJ's today. I must give it four stars mostly because the waitress, Nichole, placed them in a superior category. I very seldom give 5 stars. Everything must be exceptional. I must, however, rate Nichole as a 5 star waitress.  We had to wait to be seated because there were numerous graduating parties which were not a problem. The moment we were seated our drink orders were taken. The drinks were delivered in a timely fashion. Exactly the right time was given to peruse the menu and make our decisions. Nichole was very efficient in taking our orders and getting drinks and meals to the correct people with no hitches.  I ordered the unlimited soup (clam chowder) and Caesar salad. Both the soup and salad I must point out were delicious. The waitress was quick to point out that I had unlimited soup refills. I did make use of that offer. I have ordered this before and as then was greatly pleased. This time I found out that I could have a different kind of soup for the other bowls.  Nichole had drink refills to the tables before a glass was empty, took away dirty dishes, etc. I know some of this is in the job description, but many don't do it.

Eric D.,"Cornelius, NC",104,376,685,4.0,8/16/2008,"BJ's is a typical, in some ways, Micro Brewery/ Restaurant.  It differs from RAM, Rock Bottom Brewery, and etc. because I liked this one.   Atmosphere - Busy, stripmall-ish restaurant w/an open and spacious feel.   Service - Angela was prompt and helpful. Food - To start, I had a pint of their Blonde ale.  This was chosen after the server provided a couple of samples, as I had a hard time choosing.  I then proceeded with a house salad that was a little basic, nothing exciting.  For the main dish I went w/Balsamic Chicken w/garlic potatoes and shoestring onions on a bed of mixed greens.  It was surprisingly very good because as opposed to other places of this ilk, BJ's used fresh chicken!!!  For dessert (I always get dessert) I had their signature Pizookie.  The server again helped as I could not decide and allowed me to get half oatmeal raisin, half chocolate chip.  The Pizookie was served warm w/two scoops of ice-cream.  Although very good, next time I would do two different halves as the oatmeal cookie's flavor over powered the chocolate chip flavor.

I was ordering my meal (we had a party of five) and as I was ordering a bus boy ran by and nailed the side of my head, so hard that I had to stop ordering and re gather my self, the waitress was very understanding but the bus boy was like ""oops and just keep running"" totally an asshole move. I got up and went to the bathroom to gather myself and put a bit of water in my hair so I did look like I just woke up. The manager was outside the bathroom and I waited patiently for him and he would just look up and then look down, so I finally just walked and said ""you are the manager right?"" and of course he said yes, I told him what happen and said that I know you are busy but that was unacceptable, I wasn't even asking for anything free just an ""I'm sorry or I'll talk to him or who was it please point them out"".  But he was just like ""ok,ok,ok"", like I was bugging him. Just another middle aged, balding, over weight restaurant chain manager. It is sad, because again I wasn't causing a scene or asking for anything free, and he was a total prick. I will discontinue visiting the restaurant, which is also sad due to them building a new on in my home town (only about 30 miles away) as we speak and I routinely take my 25 employees out to lunch, at least twice a week if not more, and BJ's will not be on that list once it opens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=580

Patricia C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/24/2012,"By far this was the worst dining experience I've ever had. My friends and I frequent BJ's often and after the experience from yesterday I can honestly say I have my doubts of this place.  At approximately 1pm on 4/12 we arrive to BJ's (group of 4) we asked to be seated at a booth, the lady that was seating us rolled her eyes to the other hostess. Okay, we didn't say anything, I'm sure our request was an inconvenience. We get seated and order our drinks and appetizers. We wait and finally get our ice teas and they are brought without lemon or sugar. We ask and wait again. Our appetizer platter is brought to our table and the person who brought it asks if we need plates (irrelevant question to ask when a group of 4 people are sharing a large appetizer platter.) Our lunch plates our served to us and the person just walked away...we didn't even get a chance to ask for ketchup or anything else. We try to get our servers attention but she ignored us (I understand that you can get busy but we were pretty much neglected) finally we flag another person down and ask for ketchup and mustard...by that time some of our food had got cold, our drinks were not refilled and our server had not bothered to check on us.  The bill is brought and we paid and still left a reasonable tip of 25% (we understand people have bad days). As we were getting up to leave and walking towards the door the waitress shouts ""Ladies you didn't pay your bill"" I have never had anything like that happen to me ever!! We kindly go back to the table where she is (she was at our table) and show her we did pay the bill. She did not even apologize, just turned and walked away. I have never been so humiliated in public like I was yesterday at BJ's in Vacaville. We ask to speak to a manager (because at this point...your establishment should know how bad we as paying customers were treated.) The manager pretty much just replied ""OK"" and said it was probably all a misunderstanding but didn't even seem sincere.

I will say that this is not the best place to go with a large party because the Posi System BJ's works with is not the most server friendly.

Alice E.,"San Francisco, CA",146,407,28,1.0,10/17/2010,"1 Star for the food... read on -  Wait and service as slow as a snail. Arrived at 4:45pm, place was 1/3rd full.. The wait for a table of 6, still took 20 minutes. Odd since I saw so many empty tables. Anyways, after being seated, our server came and took our orders. Another 30 minutes our food comes out.. My group ordered:  Bruschetta, chicken salad, Caesar salad, 2 apple crisps, and pork sliders. We asked the waitress to bring the food out whenever rdy. Food was tasty, although it took a tad long to come out when the restaurant wasn't at full capacity.. Scary to imagine how long it takes when they are slammed at full capacity. Food was good tho.. no complaints there.  My biggest gripe is that I wanted to leave my credit card with the server so I could make sure no one else in my party would pay, since I wanted to treat. The hostess said I should wait too give the card to the server myself, but I couldn't find her... so she asked me to wait at the front desk for the server to come back around. So I reluctantly wait for what felt like 15 minutes, in reality prob 3-4 minutes.. and still my waitress was still no where to be found. I asked the hostess again, if the my waitress was coming and she said oh, well I never went to get her. OK... I then told her that ideally I would like to go back to my table and enjoy the company of my friends, and she THEN says ok let me get her. EH, you should've done that from the beginning.. (%$%&DSGYDH!) Before she leaves her safe zone behind the front counter, I tell her to not bother with my request. Actually my exact words were ""You know what never mind, I will deal with it myself."" I walk away at that point. Of course the whole table is wondering where I went, and one even noticed me hovering at the front desk. Yeah so that didn't go over well. I guess this is my biggest gripe, and the waiting for a table when the restaurant being empty didn't help, and the slow kitchen. I guess if you want to come for food, then by all means.. but have your patient hat on, because the staff, although easy on the eyes, really don't know whats going on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=500

I proceeded to tell him I was interested in a day next month.  I was then told that a calendar wasn't set up for next month but he would do so as we were talking.  He also began explaining that I would have to sign a contract and would still have to pay for the entire estimated amount of people event if that amount was not in attendance--that was fine...sounded as if he was trying to discourage me from moving forward with my inquiry.  THEN, when I told him the exact date and time, he said he had nothing available.  Nothing but a joke!  I just wasted 20 minutes on the phone when he could have just asked the appropriate questions from the beginning.  Seems like a matter of laziness.

My husband got the spaghetti and meat balls, and he ate his fill with leftovers to take home. My only complaint is the outrageous price they charge for margaritas, a whopping $ 9.25! Seriously?! The beer pitcher got my husband and I almost 3 full glasses each..anyway, BJ's also sells kegs of beer, which we've gotten. Yum. So all in all, fabulous dinner minus the pricey margaritas.

I'm very disappointed because I love BJ's food but we recently had a baby and had no choice but to avoid dining in since our little one gets so fussy. We really wanted to eat there so we decided to try their to-go online ordering. I'm very impressed that they have online ordering since I hate talking on the phone BUT just because you can't see, hear or wait on me doesn't mean that a paying customer deserves crappy food. My husband and I ordered the same things that we always do and found everything to be sub-par. The kid's mac and cheese was extremely bland. The vegetables in the Atlantic salmon dish were very undercooked. They are normally very soft but this time they were crunchy. My husband's usual custom pizza was missing it's basil pesto, which normally is cooked underneath the cheese. The waitress brought it to the chef and he just squirted it on top of the pizza. It looked like squirts of green poo here and there. When she returned the pizza she told my husband that she didn't know what else to do. Considering the fact that it was $2.00 extra (for an already $20 medium pizza) we were very disappointed. When we got home and tried it, it was no better than it looked. As my husband says ""it looks like a green elf pooped on it.""

Daniel H.,"Concord, CA",262,226,15,3.0,11/28/2009,"This is a decent chain restaurant, with some decent nutritious choices, as well as some amazingly horrible dishes, calorie-wise. The main problem is the wait. If you don't call ahead, you're faced with a 25-50 minute wait at least. The upside to that is, the restaurant often offers complimentary pizza slices to the crowd in front  It's very loud, and very crowded. However, the food is decent and worth the wait, unless you're allergic to gluten. In that case, you probably should go elsewhere, as there's only one or two choices on the menu for you. The best part is the pizookie dessert. It is the size of their mini pizza, and comes in four different flavors. Their triple chocolate pizookie is ridiculously good, and they offer a sampler pizookie now that is great for those who can't make up their minds.

It's served with a side of marinara sauce and ranch (go for the ranch =) ). The western deep dish pizza was, sad to say, too doughy and the toppings were scarce. If you've read my other reviews, yes this is another dish that needs, no requires!, some spice. If you get a deep dish, try asking them to cook it a little longer than usual, so the crust is especially crispy. By the time the fries came, I was pretty full, but they were really pillowy and crisp.  I didn't get any dessert, but I will for sure next time because it smelled super good!

The place was bombastically loud and crazy busy.  One might think, ""they are busy, they must be doing something right?""  Well that totally disregards the fact that there isn't much in the way of sophisticated dining or much of a ""local"" food movement in this particular area.  It is the land of sub par, industrial complex food.  If you don't mind being a number,  mindlessly eating plasticky undoubtedly microwaved food,  served by femme-bot MTV spring break wannabes sporting bizzare make up, this is the place for you.  The fact that they publish the inexplicable number of calories for each dish is commendable, but certainly caused me to have even more doubts about their food. How can you possibly pack 1200 calories into a salad, unless you glaze each piece of lettuce with lard?  The one slightly redeeming aspect to my BJ's experience was the gluten free pie-zookie.  That was nice, EXCEPT for the fact that the vanilla ice cream was clearly over processed and had a vaguely chemical aftertaste.  Oh well...no surprises here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=400

The flatbread was as expected. The shame is truly the service. The place was adequately staffed for a Wed night but the servers can't get their act together. After two different servers asked me within a minute of each other if I was ready to order when I clearly just sat down you would think they would take my order when ready. Nope, had the menu closed and took them a good 10 minutes to come and take my order. While I was eating I got the obligatory walk by to see if I needed anything. But when I was obviously finished with my meal and ready to order dessert (plates pushed away, dessert menu opened) the staff just walked by and my server stood at the next table chatting while I waited another 15 minutes for the other server to be directed to my table.   Pretty sad service for a Wed night.

She apologized and brought it out no more than 5 minutes later, clarifying upon delivery that it would NOT be on our tab due to the delay. Sweeeeet! We also ordered a half Great White and half BJ's Favorite pizza. When they brought the pizza out, it was a bit tepid and I swear a quarter of the pizza was nothing but dough and sauce...

We finally went to check on what was taking so long to be sat and found out they gave the table to someone else. They quickly found us new seating, so all was fine, but there has to be a better way to let people in the bar know they're table is ready. We started with the chips and salsa, which were meh... I'm a fan of fresh pico de gallo style salsa and this was a more smokey cooked kind of salsa. I probably wouldn't order it again. I had the BBQ chicken salad on the servers recommendation and loved it! I don't know how they season the chicken but it was delicious, and the salad had the perfect ratio of chicken, to lettuce, to extras, to dressing. It was delicious to the last bite!

The BJ's in Vacaville, Ca is way too overcrowded, and not enough staff on hand to serve customers.  I only went to the BJ's in Vacaville twice when I used to live there, and on both accounts, I had the worst experiences with customer service and fine dining.   The first time I went was back in 2008.  I ordered a giant baked potato meal and a side salad with blue cheese dressing.  When the salad arrived, I got a vinaigrette dressing instead of blue cheese.  I told the waiter that I asked for blue cheese dressing.  He took my salad back to the kitchen and returned 3 to 5 minutes later with my salad.  I took a bite, and could taste blue cheese dressing mixed with the vinaigrette that was on there from before.  Just awful!  Didn't even have the decency of giving me a whole new salad, but made matters worse by combining two completely different tasting salad dressings.  Just awful!  When my baked potato came, it wasn't even light and fluffy when I carved into it.  It was clumpy and chalky; like as if someone warmed it up in a microwave, and didn't put it in long enough. I waited a full year before I gathered up enough courage to go back to BJ's.  I thought, ""Well, it's been a year... Maybe the management and staff has changed during this time.""  I was wrong! In 2009 I went with my boyfriend at the time.  We opened the door to the front, and there was a female staff member on the phone with a customer.  She didn't acknowledge our presents by giving us a nod letting us know that she'll be right with us.  Nothing.  She was on the phone for nearly 10 minutes.  Then after her conversation, she hung her phone up and left the podium to talk to someone that was waiting in a chair by the door.  She seemed like she knew the person or was friends with that person, because she conversed with that individual for another 5 minutes.  So far, me and my boyfriend were waiting for almost 15 minutes at the front door with no acknowledgment that we wanted to eat at their restaurant! After the front desk lady was done conversing with the person in the chair by the door, she left in a hurry to the main dinning room.   At this point my boyfriend and I were like WTF?  Is this really happening?  She didn't acknowledge us, didn't take down a name, didn't ask us how many in our party, didn't tell us that it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait for a table, didn't even say sorry for the wait how may I help you?  Basic common courtesy 101.  She just zoomed down the hallway to the main dining part of the restaurant, and no one came back to fill in for her absence at the front podium.   My boyfriend and I waited an additional 5 minutes for someone to come back to the front podium to help us out, but nobody showed up! My boyfriend and I waited 20 minutes up at the front with NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT that we wanted a table to eat at.  NOTHING!  Usually, a person that waits that long at the front gets a buzzing coaster that would have gone off by that time!  We said screw this, and left! I talked to a guy from work that lives in the Vacaville area about a week ago (this is March 2014.  Present day time.) about my two experiences with the BJ's in Vacaville, and he said that it's pretty much the same as it was when you were there 5 years ago.  He told me that when he was there last, the waiters and waitresses never came by to refill their table's glasses. And you know what, it took me 3 MORE years from that crappy service that I had at the one in Vacaville to even want to go to another BJ's!  When the one in the Arden Fair Mall opened up in Sacramento, Ca. I got up the courage to go to that one and try it out.  And you know what?  Their service and food IS AWESOME!  So then I decided to try the one in Roseville, Ca. and you know what?  Their service and food IS AWESOME AS WELL!  So, it's not the chain that's the problem, it's the BJ's that's in Vacaville that's the problem!   My advice to the BJ's that run the corporate office:  Fire the manager and staff working at the one in Vacaville!  They don't know what customer service is if you threw it in their face!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=340

My daughters corn dogs seemed a bit over cooked. However my husband liked his pizza. This was a special event. The kitchen had us waiting while they washed more dishes for our cake.

An hour passes by and many people have been seated before us that showed up later then is, to be clear it was just 4 of us and we had the pagers like everyone else. We also waited close by the counter in case they call us. We went up to the hostess with too much makeup on and asked how much longer and she said that she had called us 3 times with no answer, but not only did our pager not go off, we did not here he call our names, I distinctly remember the only 4 party table being called was for someone named cristy. With quick exchange of looks between the hostesses, one decides to finally seat us to a table. As far as that goes, the server was very quick and helpful throughout the rest of our visit.

I asked for a watermelon-wheat, but they didn't have it on their ""guest list"" or whatever they call it, and our waitress suggested the Nit-Wit instead. The food is typical of a brewery, burgers. sandwiches, salads, pizzas, pastas, chef specials etc..and I believe they are owned by the cheesecake factory, so they're pretty good.   Try their Pizookie dessert..SOOOOO good! You can pick what cookie flavor you want, and they bake it in this dish, then top it with your choice of ice cream.  We got the white chocolate macadamia cookie, topped with vanilla ice cream. YUM!

There's the usual pizza (deep dish is a must), sandwiches, pasta, salads, tons of small plates and you can't forget their famous pizookie! We ordered a Mediterrean pizza, some wings and Santa Fe spring rolls. Wings were a little too crispy but still good, Pizza was delicious.  My main complaint was the service. We were seated promptly, however our waiter was a bit too pushy, We all felt rushed eating our meal. I understand being attentive to customers but if you see them having a conversation don't keep coming over with questions or ask if we need the check. Even after telling her we needed some time she kept coming over!!

Taylor H.,"Tucson, AZ",156,4,7,1.0,3/1/2017,"Been twice in the last two weeks, won't be returning. My husband and I decided to go out to eat last minute on Valentine's Day. I called BJ's to check the call ahead seating wait - we were told 30 minutes and put our name on. When we got there (within the 30 min) we were told it would be another 30 minutes.... so what's the point of call ahead seating?? Luckily, a table opened up in the bar area and we took that (no waiting for bar).  My food was good (Parmesan crusted chicken), my husband ordered a steak and it was flavorless. Our waitress forgot to apply a coupon we had, but we brushed it off because we knew she was busy. We returned the next week with a friend and the whole experience was bad.  When our hostess sat us, I asked her what the happy hour hours were. She informed us we couldn't order happy hour in the main dining area, only in the bar area. I said that's fine, but I'd like to know the hours. She says, ""Well I'm under 21 so I don't know.""  .............. WHAT????? You work here, it's your job to know that. That's the dumbest answer I've ever heard. When our waitress came I asked her what the happy hours were, she said she didn't know. Again, I was stunned at people not knowing their job. I asked her to find out so she goes over to the bar area and comes back to let us know. Do the employees really not know what they're doing, or are they trained to say ""I don't know"" so people are discouraged from walking up to the bar and bringing it to the table for the happy hour price? (We also tried to sit in the bar area to get happy hour price but no tables were open.)  Throughout our time there, the waitress wasn't attentive, she kept disappearing, we had to always ask for our drinks to be refilled, and everything took a long time, we were there for quite a while. My food came out over cooked.  I asked the waitress if that was standard (I knew it wasn't). She responds with, well it really just depends on who the cook is each night.  I sent it back and when she brought it back, it wasn't right again. The manager came over to speak with me and I asked if there was a standard way to cook things. He told me the food gets prepped earlier in the day and maybe it's gotten messed up by now. I told him I won't order that item again (Parmesan crusted chicken) because I don't want to play the guessing game of how it's going to come out. He took my meal off of our ticket which I was grateful for, but the experience as a whole has turned me off from this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=160

I thought the menu had a lot of unique items and we were excited about the idea of trying unique types of foods. However, the results were also disappointing. I can't say that the food was particularly delicious. The ""lasagna deep dish"" was basically a big ravioli and was one of the nastiest things I've had. We also tried their carnitas french fries... the fries were okay but the mix of the two didn't work for me. We also tried the stuffed avocados which were good just because they were avocados and everything is great with it. But I probably won't order it again.  Chicken wings were pretty good and were probably the best thing of the 4 we ordered. however, I'm not sure it's enough of a reason to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=160

Lisa W.,"Oregon City, OR",13,37,,2.0,9/5/2015,"My husband and I went in for a few beers and a snack at about nine PM tonight and sat in the bar side.  The service was very slow taking our drink order and getting out drinks.  When the drinks did arrive - a Red Ale and the Temple of Stone IPA - they were quite flat - especially the IPA.  My husband pointed this out to the server and his observations were blown off by the server.  As we drank our flat beer - we noticed that the beer was leaving film marks on the side of the pint glass.  This is a sure sign that the glassware washer is not set up right or the restaurant is using cheap soap/rinse agent. We ordered wings and then we ordered a Lagunitas IPA and a glass of water (my husband switched to water since he was annoyed at the beer).  This was the third ""flat"" beer they served us! So my husband asked to see the duty manager - he checked the beers and confirmed that the CO2 was off for the Red Ale and the Lagunitas - and he said the Temple of Stone keg was off and he was going to call the distributor in the morning.  He replaced the Lagunitas with one poured with the correctly adjusted CO2 - but this place is far from a ""brew house"" since we ended up being served three out of three beers with the wrong level of CO2 and in poorly washed glassware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-vacaville?start=160

A G.,"Vacaville, CA",1,39,,1.0,1/30/2017,"My husband chose BJ's to celebrate his birthday with our family. We arrived at 5:30 on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately which was great. We told the hostess at the front counter and the gentleman that seated us that it was my husband's birthday and we also told the waiter when we were placing the order.  The waiter took our drink and appetizer orders right away and our meal orders five minutes later. He brought our drinks quickly and then that's pretty much the end of any kind of attentive service. Our drinks were dry most of the time and we had to keep flagging him down to get him to refill them. One of the times I asked for a refill and he came back 20 minutes later and asked us if we wanted any more drinks and I had to remind him of my original request. This was the least of the problem. It was 50 minutes later and they brought my husband's side salad but no appetizers had shown up so I asked him to look into it. Another 10 minutes passed and the appetizers showed up. The calamari was overcooked and the chicken potstickers were flat out cold. He apologized and said he would have them redo them. We were there for over an hour before our dinner showed up. I had ordered a Cobb salad and took one bite and the lettuce was so limp and soggy it was slimy. I sent that back and asked them to take it off the bill. An hour and a half after we were seated, two waiters showed up with all three of our appetizers again but looked at the table and asked if we had already had our appetizers. I explained that we had sent back the potstickers but at this late hour I would like them removed from the bill. At 645 we placed orders for Pizookies thinking we would get ahead of the game. At 7:15 another server showed up with another order of calamari. Are you kidding me? At 7:20 dessert showed up. The cookies are much thinner than I remember and it was like mining for cookies trying to get them out of the pan. Still delicious but much skimpier. The entire dinner took over two hours for four of us. As I watched my husband order dessert, I realized that there had been no acknowledgment of his birthday nor anything done about it. They told me at the door leaving that normally they do a small pizooki. It wouldn't have done any good to say anything at that point because our server was pretty much nonexistent throughout the meal unless we flagged him down. It wasn't until I was reviewing the bill that we realized the french fries my son ordered were never delivered either.  My kids love the dessert but my husband and I will be hard-pressed to return to this restaurant. It was a complete disappointment.

Honestly, besides fries and a few other sides nothing (unless I do the ""and can I get this salad without cheese?"" or ""can you leave the chicken off the salad?"") Restaurants like BJ's need to put much more variety on their menu! It's a 20 pages long menu, but I couldn't find a single clearly vegan main dish. Please cater to a wider population than just the meat-eaters and cheese-addicts and mayo lovers! The service from the waitress itself was good, that's why I give two stars.
