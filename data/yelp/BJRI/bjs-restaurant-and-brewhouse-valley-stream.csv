Gael M.,"Queens, New York, NY",156,189,85,4.0,12/17/2016,Seems their service has picked up since I first dined in here. The trend seems to be better service near the bar area. Bumped these guys up to 4 stars! Check out full review below.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20
Lauren D.,"New York, NY",161,42,1,2.0,7/6/2017,"My boyfriend and I wanted to try somewhere new in the area and since we are both into craft beer, we thought we would try out BJ's. He is big into reviews so he had me check out Yelp prior to us making the drive. I read that the food was pretty good  but the service was terrible. Against our better judgement, I said it couldn't possibly be that bad so we decided to try it, not expecting a world class meal but again.. something new. When we arrived, it wasn't crowded and they sat us right away. This is when it all went downhill. We arrived at 7:45-7:50 and sat at the table for 40 MINUTES without a waiter even looking at us. Both my boyfriend and I are very non-confrontational so we just waited hoping that one of the THREE waiters in our section would come over to us eventually. Mind you - there were four tables seated directly next to us and across from us that were being waited on. Even a couple who came in after us were getting their drink orders taken immediately.  After almost a full hour passed, I finally decided I had to get someone's attention because at this point it was either that or we would have to walk out. As I mentioned, I am not one to be confrontational, especially to people in the service industry but it was getting ridiculous. I went to the front and very politely told the hostess that no one had come to us yet and asked if she could send someone over. She was very nice and apologetic and said she would grab someone. She immediately pulled over one of the waitresses in our section and asked her to take care of us at which time the waitress blatantly SHOOK HER HEAD 'NO' and walked away.  The hostess then had to grab a waitress from another section who had a bunch of tables to attend to on the other side of the restaurant, and ask her to come over to us. She came over  right away and apologized very genuinely. From that point on, the night was fine as the waitress who did take care of us was very nice and attentive and the food was very good. But it did not make up for being ignored for a full hour. We both agreed that although the food was very good we will never be returning to BJ's because of the service alone. Such a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20

Jason C.,"Long Beach, NY",788,263,2534,5.0,11/19/2016,"While shopping at the brand new Green Acres Commons (which my friend Christina J helped build), we were getting hungry. I see BJ's Brewhouse (NO, not BJ's wholesale club) and figured let's try it out?! What a great addition to not only Green Acre Commons but to LI in general.   Waking in you can already see the restaurant is very open and spacious. The bar is very long with all the bottles of liquor lined up ever so gently & neatly, making a very nice color scheme.  Greeted very graciously by our hostess and sat immediately. Our waitress (who I forgot her name- sorry) was very friendly & attentive. She was great! Service all in all was really good. No problems there.  The food was even better than it sounded or even expected. We were all satisfied and pretty ""wowed"" with everything. Yes, it's a chain but the food has a fun funky vibe to it. Everything that we tried was great! And of course you gotta save the best for last , make sure you save room for a ""PIZOOKIE""!!! You won't regret it- we tried a sampling of each and all were amazing.  One better than another. Try them all!  ENJOY my fellow Yelp friends !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20
Nick C.,"Hewlett, NY",0,26,9,2.0,8/13/2017,I ordered the combo deep dish pizza was good. Crust nice and light like a focaccia. 6 slices good for a person with appetite. Friend had burger and fries. Also good. Service was good. Wish they had take out menu but rep said they ran out and on order. May come back. Conv located near mall and shops. Came back yesterday for lunch with a friend. Service was not good. Brought out wrong pizza and iced tea. Was double charged for the iced tea. Manager came over and after showing him check over and over it was fixed. Pizza and salad were tasty only good part of visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20

Gilbert P.,"Brooklyn, NY",369,29,31,4.0,9/15/2017,"I would rate 4.5 stars but I can't do a half star on yelp. I came with very low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  Ordered the BLT salad and it was actually a healthy salad with the right amount of vinaigrette. The pizza was good, not a true Chicago deep dish but I would order again.  The brisket burger was very good, next time I'll make sure the bacon is ordered crispy.  Our waiter was EXCELLENT!!!   He wet out of his way to explain the menu, to accommodate a kitchen snafu (we watched him write the correct order down) and had a great sense of humor accompanied with being attentive. I will definitely be returning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20
Lelosa I.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",40,13,65,3.0,5/31/2017,Been here many times and never disappointed except for the wait time which is annoying sometimes. They always miss something when you get your food whether utensils or a napkin or a straw. One time I waited 15 minutes for my waiter to give me ketchup. I ended up asking the table behind me after my food was getting cold. Their pastas are a hit and miss just go to Olive Garden. Their burgers are really good especially the Black and Bleu burger. They need to work on there fries I've tasted better so I always have them left over. Their pizookie is everything I always look forward to it. This place is literally a hit or miss. I went back a few weeks later to get my Blac and Bleu cheese burger and it was disgusting. I ended up getting sweet potato fries and some Root beer glazed chicken wings which were amazing. I just have to stick to their shareable apps and their pizookie because everything else it literally HIT OR MISS.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20
Malini G.,"Ozone Park, NY",52,44,935,3.0,4/10/2017,"Came here on a Thursday night for a birthday dinner. Walking in the space seemed very big and the bar area had a very colorful and pretty vibe (does that even make sense?) anyways the party we were joining were already seated and waiting for us to arrive to order. We got our menus however it seemed like we were waiting a pretty long time for a waiter to take our orders, one person in the party had to actually call someone over. But the waiters were very nice and helpful, a few of the people with us asked about drinks and beers and the waitress we had was pretty helpful. We got out appetizers and drinks quickly but the food took a bit longer. Throughout our wait, it seemed like three different waiters came over to our table, we didn't have one specific waiter, not a huge deal tho. My thoughts on the food is it's average. I got the jambalaya which was okay and I tried the mash potatoes which I thought was really good. Everything else pretty average. I don't think I'd be returning for the food but I would go back for the drinks. I had the sunset Alabama and it was very good. I saw on their menu that they have a lot of drinks and beers, so you'd be good in that department.  Overall, go for the drinks. Food is average.  Waiters are helpful, but not always present.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20

I've had good experiences both times with the only ""con"" being the service is slower than most places even when not busy. Good/friendly service but just slow. It's a nice environment inside, very sports bar-ish, basically like a Miller's but with better food imo. It's probably the better food option out of all the other crap around Green Acres Mall.

Food: whisper thin flatbreads, generously topped,  boneless wings are crispy and moist, exceeding expectations,  the curried cauliflower with lentils is unusual and rewarding.  The beer: make sure to order a flight and experiment with 4 oz pours.  The dessert we chose (a trio) was fun.  Some annoying gaps in service that I almost downgraded to a 3, but refrained from doing so bc I think we had an inexperienced or new server.  The manager came over to apologize, smoothing things over - a very nice personal touch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20

May Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,48,32,3.0,2/22/2017,"Tuesday night. No waiting time. We got a booth for a party of 5. Waitress was friendly. As it was not busy, we did not understand why the wait for drinks took a while to get to our table. While we were ordering, we were notified they had no french fries. One of us ordered the bison burger and the waitress came back to tell us there's no more bison burger. We ordered two appetizers, only one came while we were still missing two drinks, one of which is a soft drink. Midway waiting for our food, the waitress came back and told us they do have fries. Okay, food came, it was good food. We ordered: The Late Night Burger;  Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe; Crispy Jalapeño Turkey Burger; Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl; Grilled Mahi-Mahi Tacos.

Kristin Z.,"Freeport, NY",26,115,11,3.0,2/11/2017,"****3.5***** TL;DR:  Food decent, Pizookies are amazing, service is slow...I'd go back for lunch when it's less crowded, or maybe a weekday evening.   We went in with the kids, 5p on a Saturday; the teen had been here before and wanted us to try a Pizookie so...why not. Place was already busy but we were seated after a quick check for a table.  Server came quickly and provided menus and took our drink order.  That's where quick service ended. We didn't receive drinks for another ten minutes or so. He took our meal orders then. I'm not disparaging our server at all- he was very friendly, had a great memory (another giant brain who takes orders without paper and ink), and got us refills when we were low; I just think he was busy. Food came out twenty minutes later, so, that wasn't bad.  Food was pretty good.  Picky Pete's quinoa (right!? He got quinoa!?) was borderline cold but the accompanying chicken was flavored well so he muddled through.  My baked ziti was huge and chock full of meatball, pepperoni and sausage.  If I wanted to nitpick, they should salt the pasta water but, it was good overall.  Teen got a hot ham and cheese with fries and it was demolished.  The fries are awesome.  Picky Pete, Jr. got chicken fingers with fries and they passed muster.   Had to wait to put in our dessert order and wait even longer to get it. But, it was worth it.  We each got a mini Pizookie- chocolate chip, double chocolate, salted caramel and monkey bread and they were all as good as the next.  I don't think you can go wrong. 3 adult entrees, 1 kid meal and pizookie, trio pizookie dessert, 4 soft drinks, before tip: $70 and change.

Nicholas S.,"Peabody, MA",41,9,4,2.0,12/3/2017,"Went yesterday for a bite to eat with the family after shopping. The atmosphere is very nice and typical for BJ's. Dark and wide open high ceilings and big booths. Server was nice and came quickly for drink orders and apps. The grand cru beer was great, it's a Belgian ale style, high alcohol and a slight bitter taste similar to Duvel or Chimay. The water and sodas took a few minutes the beer a few more then another 15 minutes for sliders and guacamole with chips and no apology for the delay. Within 1 minute we were served our entrees. So now we had all our food on the table and for some reason our entree was cold. So we returned the entrees and left after the appetizers were done. Sever seemed oblivious to the error but took the food off the bill.  The sliders were ok but it was obvious they cut a full size burger that was cut in four. Seems like a cop out to not have a separate patty. The guacamole tasted good but it was clear from the color that it was not fresh, as it was turning brownish. It's a shame as I've been to a few BJ's in Texas and they were very good. I think I'll wait for my next trip to TX before trying them again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20

Upon walking in, we were barely greeted by the host. We were seated and our waitress seem like she had no people skills. The dinner was a little uncomfortable because of the waitress's mood.

However, the food is a different story, it was horrible! I tried their quacamole burger and fries, because I had a big Christmas dinner the night before, and wanted something simple. I thought to myself how can you go wrong with a burger, but I was dead wrong! The meat was over cooked and fries were so hard and cold it was disgusting in everyway. The good part about my visit the waitress wanted to take it off my bill, but I told her I would still pay for it and even tipped her for being so nice. I don't think I would every try that burger again, even if you paid me. I don't know if there will be a next time, but you be the judge, try them out if you're in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20

Elizabeth J.,"JAMAICA, NY",53,50,38,3.0,6/13/2017,"This past Sunday, my fiance and his daughter raved about this place, so i decided to try it. First time here and before I yelp the nonsense, i just want to say the food is great and they have an extensive menu... however the service not so great! Our server Dwight greeted us at our table, seemed like a cool guy. He took our drink and appetizer order ... My fiance and i both ordered a wheat beer and I asked for a Jameson neat, in which he commented ""you're bad"". I don't understand what that meant, nor was I going to ask! He then asked if my fiance's daughter was the designated driver... she's 12!!!  The drinks took about 15 mins. When we got our drinks and our appetizer... we then placed our entree orders with Dwight. I wanted a burger and was stuck between 2 choices, so I asked Dwight which one he would recommend. Going with his choice, i asked for my burger medium rare with bacon... and he commented ""What... Indians don't eat their meat like that""...... I'm not even Indian and i stated that, then he said ""you're Spanish, oh then you're just black""! First off, who are you to assume my race or tell me how I like my food. Flabbergasted isn't even the word! I don't know how and why I didn't flip out...i actually stayed to finish my food. It didn't even stop there, i don't want to rant on yelp, but this was an unpleasant experience, especially being that it was my first time here. Dwight even told us how he was mad he had to stay an extra hour for his shift. We don't need to know your personal business.... what happened to being professional. All of that lacked here for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=20
Ces L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",22,55,167,4.0,7/9/2017,"Gathering from the mixed reviews I guess the saying ""to each their own"" comes to my mind. The boyfriend and me have been here a few times and of all those times we've never had a problem at all. I don't know if it's because we've just been lucky or we always come at the right time.  Regardless we have not had any problems with the staff and if we did have to wait it was because there was a good crowd, which is a reasonable excuse in our books. Whatever the case the ambiance here is perfect for those who love beer and watching sports. If it's not so busy the staff are even nice enough to change the channel to the team of your preference. The food hasn't disappointed us yet, for each time we've visited we pretty much tried something different. I've tried both the Portobello Swiss Burger and the Bacon Guacamole Deluxe Burger. Let's just say the burgers are very generous in portion so come hungry and skip the appetizer. I always order medium well and both times have come out perfect. I've also tried the tacos (shrimp and fried mahi mahi ), which were also bomb! For appetizers we've tried the Avocado Rolls, which were also good and perfect for sharing if you have a group of 4. Our favorite that we always get though are the Rootbeer Glaze Chicken Wings!! :P Definitely a must for every visit we make here. Lastly you can't go wrong here when it comes to the drinks. (Skip the hibiscus iced tea though.) The Berry Burst Cider is my absolute favorite especially because I'm a sucker for the fruity beers. If you're not into that there's definitely a huge selection to choose from that will sure to fulfill your alcoholic taste buds! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=40

I ordered the the crispy jalapeño burger and it wasn't bad. It had good flavor but I didn't like the the meat patty was burnt so that turned me off. The fries are really good, I liked that they were thin but the dry rub that they used on them was yummy.  The cookie and cream pizookie was delicious. The cookie was warm and soft and the ice cream of course was a nice addition. I think I will go back for that.

Tam S.,"Lynbrook, NY",0,22,,2.0,12/23/2017,"We were doing some last minute shopping in the area and were hungry so that is how we ended up here. Very unfortunately we ended up with Brie as our waitress and I say that because, the place was not busy, only a few tables were occupied and this is a pretty big place and It took Brie at least 10 minutes to first acknowledge us at our table, mind you we are all of two people. We placed our entire order, water, appetizers and entrees and I told the waitress I needed the water to take medication. After ordering I went to the bathroom and when I returned to the table a good 10 minutes later, no water at the table yet. I eventually got up and went to the bar and got a water. 20 minutes go by and still no waters. We noticed several employees together talking and looking at their cell phones, but Brie was no where to be found. Eventually I went to find the manager. He apologized about the water and brought us two waters even though I already went and got my own. Of course we only wanted lemon in one water which we were VERY SPECIFIC about to the manager, but he ignored the specifics because he did not really care as far as we were concerned. So FINALLY Brie appears out of nowhere and pretty much slams two waters down on our table, it was an ""In-your-face"" water delivery. She saw moments before that, that her manager had brought us waters. No apology for her neglect of the table whatsoever.  We ordered two appetizers: Beets/goat cheese and the brussell sprouts sirracha, both of those were amazing. We ordered the turkey burger with the portobello swisse burger dressings. I do not eat fries so I had a side of sauteed spinach, both were amazing. We also ordered the Hand-pulled Turkey Dip sandwich which also was delicious. Sad part about this place is that the service sucks, but the food was excellent. Management needs to have more control of the staff. Cell phones while on shift should NOT BE ALLOWED.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=40

Angelo B.,"Valley Stream, NY",58,125,166,5.0,10/21/2016,"What a great addition to the area. We were seated promptly, and everyone was so friendly.(hopefully this lasts, and it's not just because they just opened) Our server was Bryan and he was very knowledgeable about the beers (do they have to take a beer class prior to working here?)  Told him what I liked and he gave some recommendations, ended up trying the 5oz sampler (4 beers 5oz each)  it was a great idea because we got to sample a bunch of different beers that they have to offer.  The harvest hefeweizen was my favorite of the bunch. It was pretty light and had a good taste. Next favorite was the Jeremiah red, 7.3% alcohol! Good thing I got a sample.  That also was very good but a bit heavy for my taste. The oasis was ok, the only one I wasn't crazy about was the nutty brewnette. It was too heavy for me, plus I still had to get through dinner Note: I don't drink often anymore, so take that into account. Appetizers:  Mozzarella sticks, not bad...the selling point for me was the garlic butter breading. Definitely had a unique (in a good way) taste, the only problem was that the mozzarella was a bit disappointing...maybe a better quality cheese would help put it over the top. Side salad (house salad?)  Disappointing...basically just chopped lettuce with a couple slices of tomato. We can do better than that (the full entree salads looked amazing from the menu though!) on to the entrees! I ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. DAMN...that was a good burger, cooked perfectly and the brisket was delicious.  I though maybe between the burger, the brisket, the bacon and the bbq sauce...maybe it would be a bit too much. But they all got along fine, and I really enjoyed it.  Fries were great too!  Thin and crispy. Wife had the salmon quinoa bowl, and was really surprised by how good it was. Kids menu...a bit underwhelming considering the great options for adults. Chicken tenders, burger,corn dogs, kraft mac&cheese... KRAFT MAC&CHEESE? Are we at applebees? C'mon...based on the quality of the food we had...I see no reason why bj's cant make a quality mac& cheese from scratch.  Plus, lets add some more options... Grilled chicken? Fish? Glad to see they have vegetables and fruit as an option so that's a plus. All in all it was an excellent experience,  the atmosphere was great and the servers were very friendly. Our server was especially friendly and knowledgeable about the food and drinks. Will definitely come again to try something else.

Tony C.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,143,92,5.0,10/27/2016,"Brand new spot in the Green Acre Mall, decided to give it a try. Staff was pretty friendly, wait was reasonable. Since this was a new place, I went with a simple healthy salad while my family went with the deep dish pizza and a burger.  All of the food was pretty good. The pizza was thick and generously topped with Hawaiian toppings! Pizza was very filling and fresh!  The burger was really good, not very healthy but that translate into delicious pretty much. Fries were very good, usually the separating factor between burgers from other places in comparison.  My salad was the least fun, tasty but very boring and the kale taste overpowered the salad which will probably prevent me from doing it again, doesn't mean it wasn't good, just too kale-y for me.

The waitstaff is attentive, but not overbearing. I had the Jambalaya, which was surprisingly good. The portion was American and the taste was just right. My wife had a burger, which was terrible. It was dry and extremely greasy. The waitress probably should have checked on us once to see how the meals were, but that didn't happen.

I've had the baked ziti twice, who is a guilty pleasure. The shrimp with penne and asparagus is also good. I would recommend this place because let's be real there aren't that many good places to sit down and be served in this part of town!

Apparently the restaurant was BJ first. I came here for lunch and it was nice. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. We started with the avocado egg rolls which were delicious and reminded me of the ones from the Cheesecake Factory. The deep dish pizza was delicious and a must try. The kale salad and the salmon with quinoa was delicious as well. There is an extensive menu to choose from. You can get anything from burgers, to pasta and pizza. The have nice roomy booths. I would definitely return to try other dishes.

William B.,"Valley Stream, NY",1,9,35,1.0,3/10/2017,"I always wanted to try this restaurant out. So one day while I was nearby I decided to stop by. I walked in and nobody is at the front to seat me, so I walk over to the bar and sit down. Mind you there's so many workers I couldn't believe it. All of them clustered in the corner talking amongst themselves. Two bartenders are here, I'm sitting for a couple mins nobody greets me.. finally the girl comes over talking very loud to the other bartender about how she's about to end her shift and literally throws me a menu and doesn't say anything then runs away. Doesn't asks me if I need anything to drink, doesn't tell me about any specials for the day, or happy hour. At this point I should have walked out or talked to the manager, but surely it couldn't get any worse. Now I'm sitting there reading the menu and of course I'd love a water or a drink, the bartender walks past countless times and doesn't ask if I need a water or anything to drink.. I'm one of three people at the bar, so it's not like he's busy. Finally a miracle happened. He made eye contact and said ""Hey"" to me after I stared him down for a few minutes. So I knew this was probably going to be my only chance to order so I took the leap. I blurted out my order and as I'm doing so he's walking away.. I was only able to get my food order in since he walked away, now I had to wait till he's close by to get his attention for a drink. Now as I grab his attention for a drink I tell him I want a water and a beer, but what a surprise the guy walks away as I'm ordering that too. Finally the food arrives, food looks great. I wouldn't have anything to complain about if I loved my meals prepared under the Pacific Ocean. The food was overloaded with salt. Now in the middle of the meal I see a tap handle with a pear on it, it struck my interest since I've made ciders before and I've never saw that brand of cider before. By now I'm a pro at this so I grab the bartenders attention once again and ask if I could try the cider. He says sure, now all I want is a reasonable amount so I can taste the cider, he grabs me a glass and barely pours enough to cover the bottom of the glass. Doesn't even tell me the name of the company or asks if I want a glass of it.. He just walks away as if he's trained to do so. Finally after being done with my meal nobody came to take it away or ask if I'd like anything else. It's such a shame, the customer service and the quality of the food. This place is so nice on the inside, the music wasn't too loud, and they had so many great local beers. I would absolutely love it here if they service and food had an upgrade. This place at least needs to make some serious change to the staffing because the experience I had and what I saw was the worst I've ever seen. I will never be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=40
Michelle F.,"Queens, NY",2,45,16,1.0,3/6/2017,"There's no denying that the food at BJs is good. I've never been disappointed. However to service is unbelievably slow, it makes the experience painful.  20 min wait just to order, another 15 to get drinks. We order two apps and a large pie. Waited long again for appetizers and were told that our pizza was ready at the same time.  We said it's okay, bring it out. Our waitress then disappeared for another 20 mins just for a food runner to bring out a cold pizza.  Last time we were here I saw a customer refusing to pay, due to poor service as well.

Walked in & the restuarant was not full nor busy yet the hostess took a good 5 mins to figure out where to seat us. Then we sat down & it took another 20 mins before the waitress even introduced herself to us. Ordered a medium well steak that took another 30 mins to be ready & by time it was ready it was well done. Matter of fact I sat by the table and had to called the manager to find out why is the service so slow and it's not even busy in there. I had my heart set on a pizookie but refused to order it because that probably meant I would have to wait another 30mins  Bottom line this place needs to improve on the service and the attitudes of the waiters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=40

David M.,"Merrick, NY",94,467,346,4.0,9/4/2017,"I wondered if another Brewhaus pub and grille chain restaurant could be successful on Long Island, with so much competition around.  BJ's seems to fit in well.  It's nicer then say a TGi Friday's or Applebee's,  but not quite as refined as say Houlihans.  It's similar to Millers ale house, however Bjs has much less televisions and a much larger menu with seemingly endless choices. It's one of the largest book menus I've seen.  By the way this place has no ties or relations to the wholesale club with a similar name.  Let's get down to the brass tax.  Service was very good, friendly and accommodating.  We ordered Grilled Mahi Fish tacos,  A Deep Dish signature pizza and a house salad.  Everything I just listed tasted very good, and fresh.  Wait times for the food were also reasonable considering the place was pretty full on our visit. We tried some mini churros with ice cream for dessert and they were delicious.  Clean bathroom as well.  They exceeded my expectations and was better then the mixed Yelp reviews made it out to be.

Plus, she actually checked up on us as often as necessary and make sure everything is okay. (I wish I knew her name so I could mention her here!)

Jay A.,"JAMAICA, NY",6,5,2,1.0,10/22/2017,"I thought I'd try and give this place a chance. A friend and I went there on 10/14/17 during dinner time. We were seated fairly quickly, FYI the menu is a novel. Do yourself a favor and check the menu online before you go to save time. We ordered for drinks the 5oz. Beer sampler, unsweetened iced tea and a glass of water. For an appetizer we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. Here's the beginning of a interesting time. For the entree I ordered the Barbecue chicken deep dish pan pizza with mushrooms added on. My friend originally ordered the pork chop but was told, they were all out.(This should've of been the first sign considering it was only 8:30pm and you can only order the pork chop after 4pm.) So my friend ordered the Crusted Parmesan chicken, which comes with mash potatoes and steamed broccoli. Five minutes later a runner comes to the table with the spinach/artichoke dip w/nachos. This wouldn't have been an issue except, his hand is holding the plate touching the nachos. This is first major no no. He apologizes and corrects the issue. Literally 5 minutes later another runner comes to the table with our entrees. He seems annoyed that our table doesn't have a pizza stand. He asked me where is it, I let him know that I have no idea, there wasn't one at my table to begin with, and my waitress Claudia didn't bring one when i ordered. Now I've been to restaurants in many places, but I've never received my appetizer and entree, before I received my beverages. Also all my food in under 10 minutes???? We know it's not made to order. The appetizer: now it's advertised as a dip it was HORRIBLE. It tasted like cream of spinach with sour cream.Claudia finally came with our drinks and a pizza stand, and apologized for the dip. The pizza was actually alright for being pre-made but not worth $20. My friend said the chicken tasted and looked like it had been under the heat lamp long before we arrived. The broccoli was raw, and for some odd reason the lemon wedge we asked for in the water was in the mashed potatoes. The only good thing about this place is actually the beer and drinks. The Deal breaker was when we asked for the check. Claudia took another 20 minutes to bring it only after we put our jackets on. I paid with my debit card and she only came with the restaurant copy. I had to ask for my copy. Now I've been to restaurants around the world and have NEVER had to ask for my copy of the receipt, especially when we spent almost $100. The staff here is under trained no one knows the menu,  managers are non existent, And you have to beware your card isn't scammed.

Sometimes I'll order the buffalo chicken sandwich which comes with French fries. Instead of the French fries they'll let you substitute for any other side, such as the fresh mozzarella salad, Brussel sprouts..etc..one thing I typically ALWAYS have a problem with is the servers up charging me...for instance during the Lunch menu (12-3) you may add a soup to your entree for 1.75$..I don't know why/how the servers don't know this and always charge me full price...It's just hustle bustle: explaining it to them, while they'll still deny that offer exists until a manger finally comes out and tells them. (Blood pressure rising experience) also wanted to note out that management needs to do a better job managing their employees. Couple of days ago, my server, while on her shift and taking my order, had her headphones plugged in her phone and was having a conversation..I've seen this numerous times, and it just isn't professional.

The original waitress than comes back and tells her its ok she will take the table after all.  All of this conversation shouldn't be taking place in front of the customer. We waited a long time for the food, no one cleared the appetizer plates, so there was just a cluster of plates on our table.

As we were waiting to be seated, a couple with their daughter walked in and was seated right away ahead of us with no reservations. So I asked why they were seated first but I was ignored and we were seated immediately anyway so I let it slide.  Then there were the silverware, it was wrapped in cloth napkins but when opened, the spoon, forks and knives were dirty. Not only one set but all 3 sets were dirty. We asked for replacements and two sets were dirty. This was really disappointing and makes you wonder what else is dirty in this place. We ordered the ""Best Beginnings"" appetizer which was great, I had to ask for plates which should have been automatic. My wife ordered a cocktail which was loaded with alcohol and was undrinkable. I had the ribs and it was good. My wife had the steak and wanted it medium well and it came out medium rare, so we had to send it back to cook it off some more. By the time it came back, we had lost our appetite and took home the entrees. Overall, we had a bad experience in this place and will not come back. We did not enjoy our $100 meal.

Just a couple of highlights/lowlights on the food--the root beer glazed boneless wings were surprisingly good. I also enjoyed my baked ziti, it was basically a pizza-tasting ziti in a deep cast iron dish. Disappointed that the mac n cheese on the kids menu was mac-in-the-box, but  my daughter didn't mind. My only complaint, which is a fairly major one, was the service. I get it, they're new, but it's been a month and this isn't this chain's first rodeo. We were there for over two hours on Saturday--we showed up shortly after 5 and didn't leave until after 7. Everything was painfully slow--from the time our name was called to actually being seated, for someone to come by to take our drink order, for the drinks to arrive....it was brutal. Our server was very, very nice, didn't make any mistakes, but the restaurant has some major kinks to work out around timing and staff. Don't know how they'll end up making money if they can't turn over a table in less than two hours. I downloaded their app while we were there--I was able to pay with my phone, add the tip, and leave without having to wait for someone to come back to take the check. You get points per dollar and special offers via the app as well. We weren't drinking at dinner this time but would definitely love to go back and try some of their extensive selection of beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=80

Not a foodie's paradise, but a good, solid place to dine. They allow parties of 6 and under to call ahead, so you don't have to wait (just don't get there late...).

Nathan M.,"Hicksville, NY",237,4,,2.0,2/11/2017,"Got the $20 appetizer platter with wings, mozzarella sticks, spinach and artichoke dip, and avocado egg rolls. Mozzarella sticks were tubes of fried breading that didn't even contain cheese. Spinach and artichoke dip wasn't bad but wasn't good, and also came burnt. Egg rolls were decent, a little spicy to give you a heads up. And the wings were the only redeeming factor - root beer glaze sauce was good. Chicken quality was equivalent to Applebee's.  Although the service was great and very friendly, I probably won't go back.

David M.,"Jamaica, NY",2,3,,4.0,10/14/2016,"Based off of the experiences I had with restaurants around this area (namely, Bronx BBQ), I kept my expectations for this brewhouse bottom-of-the-barrel low. This was the right move... because I was all the more pleased when the place turned out to be pretty good.  When I first walked in, I noted that the dinihg space was much smaller than it appeared from the outside. This was fine though, as what was there was well lit and smartly decorated. The service, from hostess to waitress to busboy, was very helpful and cordial. There was this one server who gave us this educational speech on the hops in certain beers and how it would make the jalapenos on the Crispy Flatbread Nachos more bearable.  Speaking of the beers itself, I found their in-house brewed pumpkin ale to be a little on the watery side, but my girl liked it. I had the Nutty Brewnette and thought it was pretty good, but nothing too remarkable. The food took a little while to get there, but when it did we were fully satisfied. My burger was well-cooked, and my girl had no complaints about the chicken tacos. I give BJ Brewhouse a light 4, but considering the green acres area it may as well be a perfect 5. Strong recommendation for those who find themselves in this mall area and want something other than watered down Applebee's drinks and abysmal service at that horrible Olive Garden.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=80

Lina L.,"Rosedale, NY",0,7,,1.0,6/29/2017,"My Best Friend and I went to BJ's Brewhouse in ""Green Acres Commons"" yesterday and the hostess was too busy talking to her little friends to properly greet us and sat us down at our table didn't say one word to us not who our server was or nothing. So we're looking at our menu's at the menu's are like textbooks so I'm thinking our waiter probably just giving us some time to make sure we know what we want. 15 minutes later another table's waiter notices us and asks if we wanted water or something. So i'm thinking maybe he's our waiter and will be back to take our orders after he gets the waters. He drops the water off and we wait an additional 25 minutes with all the staff INCLUDING THE MANAGER happily walking passed us. So finally I ask a passing waitress like... sooooo do you know who our waiter/ess is or....???? And she's confused like... wait ya'll was here the whole time and don't have a waiter. She's like going around asking everybody. A different hostess comes to the table and is like. ""So ya'll don't got no waiter? We're like no. she's like how long ya'll been waiting? We're like about 30 minutes. She's like who was your host? We describe the girl. She was like ""WOWWWW THAT'S AMAZING"" and walked away. So now i'm extremely confused then the waitress I originally asked was like well there's actually no waiters working in this section right now so idk why she sat you here but it's whatever I'll be your waitress do ya'll know what ya'll want to eat? Then when our food came out we had to ask them for utensils. Whole time no manager came over to resolve this issue.  Eventually I complained and we got two free Pizookie's which were great but WHAT? They've been open since September i'ma need them to step their customer service game all the way up. And the burger was overcooked and oily.

Gavin S.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,2,,1.0,1/15/2017,"I've been here before, and the service was great, but it has gradually become worse as the restaurant has become more popular. I highly suggest not coming here on a Saturday night or on any other busy day because the staff is obviously incompetent when it comes to servicing a packed restaurant. First off, we waited for 20 minutes for a table only to see people who arrived after us getting seated first. Whatever, we're seated and out waiter comes over, who by the way has VERY little social skills, and takes our order. However, we waited 30 minutes for appetizers and our entrees came out first. Our waiter forgot about our appetizers and went to the kitchen to get it, but by that time the appetizers were cold. Fine, we begin to eat. I take one bite out of my burger only to spit it out. The chefs vastly undercooked my burger (Hickory Brisket Burger). Literally, it was red inside and extremely mushy, any sane person could see it was not cooked at all. The waiter comes over and sends it back, saying that the chefs are overwhelmed and that it is not his fault. The new burger arrives, but another waiter brings it and doesn't know where my table is. He goes around asking other tables until he reaches us (I was too annoyed to say anything at that point). Anyway, by the time my new burger arrives, the person I was with was already full - so we just brought the food home. My previous experiences here have been good, but this is the first time I came and it was packed.

Though half the tables were empty we waited 20 Minutes to be seated, then 20 Minutes for our drink order. Then 2/3 got our drink order and we finally ordered. We waited 45 minutes for our meal and finally went to the bar to ask about the third persons drink which it turns out had been there the whole time and we now had a watered down margarita. The pizzas came. Wrong order. Sent it back apparently the waitress put in the right order but they did it wrong. One pizza came back correct but missing one ingredient which they eventually brought after we had almost finished the pizza (spinach in a bowl of butter) and asked about twice. The third person who didn't receive her drink til the food came out had to wait an additional 20 Minutes after our pizza came out for the Order to be redone and apparently they ran out of large pizzas so had to do a medium. We then waited over 20 minutes after finishing our meal for the check which was incorrect and we were way over charged. We showed the server and she went to correct it and then we received again another incorrect bill. That was then corrected. This is just the main stuff. We never received water refills except when we went to the bar to get them, we were never asked for another drink. And this doesn't begin on the food. The tavern pizza was good.

Got the guac bacon burger with a side of Caesar salad and a whiskey sour.  The burger was not medium as I asked but rather well done which was alright nonetheless, the salad seemed as it was left in the kitchen waiting for someone to rub it for a while since the dressing had dried up and dropped to the bottom of the plate. The whiskey sour was actually good just took forever to get it, ice was melted as well. The service took forever even though our waiter tried.  This place could be a very good and trendy place in the area but it must step up its game, not a good thing that just opened for a month and it doesn't leave its first time customers amazed.

I got the steak, asparagus and fries, my hubby got the ribs and mash, and my 6 year old got the pizza kids meal (his pizza was delish). From the moment we walked in we got off to a bad start due to poor customer service. Here are some tips for management. There is no reason why customer service should be so poor when this location just recently opened.  Tips:  - Have the girls at the front desk greet guests as they walk in. None of the guests were greeted. Also when someone books on the wait list online they are seated quicker.... Inform your customers! It's not fun to see everyone get seated before you and not understand why.  - please have utensils at tables before guests are seated. Also make sure utensils are clean! Not that hard.  - season your steak and ribs, have more Steak sauce a available besides A1. Everyone does not eat A1 - wait time was not long, and drinks were very strong. Keep that up!  I'll definitely be back for the drinks. That is all!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=100

The saddest part was the manger was there and he was too busy watching the game to tell the kids to stop playing and help me. I was the only person on line might I add, so finally when the kid decides to do his job and help me and look up my order he tells me he doesn't see it the after 5 minutes he locates it in the system. My salad was ready and waiting for me but my appetizer was not ready. So I had to wait for ten minutes smh. While I was waiting I was watching the staff playing and saw a waitress walk up to the counter and put her dirty feet on the counter as if it was a ballet stretch bar. I can even make this stuff up smh. I had just put my hands on the bar now you put your feet on it? Wtf! So unsanitary no common sense you put customer's food on that counter. Then my appetizer comes out and I am ready to go, my food should have been ready and waiting for me. When my husband and I drive away I noticed that there wasn't any dressing on my salad or in the bag and we where about a mile away had to come.

I told the same kid there was no dressing on my salad and he going in the back to get it and I see the staff playing again this time a guy walks up to a girl with money in her hand and pushes her she drops the money and they are all laughing they are not running a business they are running a day care center and play ground not a restaurant!

Our waitress was in a hurry; she would put the items on the table and run off. She did not know the menu. We ordered the Jambalaya. You could tell it was microwaved. It was lukewarm by the time it got to the table. The vegetables in the dish were very soggy. Too much jambalaya seasoning was sprinkled on the plate; gave the dish a powdery taste. The reviews listed here are pretty much accurate. The staff needs training. I will give it another try but it looks like this is another fast food restaurant chain.

There wasn't anyone in the restaurant she wasn't busy which is what confused me even more. Being that it was my first time at Bj's I knew nothing of the menu or what they had offer so it was even more disappointing that she couldn't tell me about a beer or cocktail or even a menu item!  Apparently this restaurant makes their own beer which I was very interested in what they had to offer and when I proceeded to ask about them Tyquana just pointed at the taps and said that's what we have! It was at this point I just decided to stick to water!

So on a Sunday after work we were looking for a nice place to grab a quick dinner and came across this place and decided to try it, it was her idea for the record. We entered the restaurant and we were greeted and immediately seated we took a while to place our order because we both didn't really see anything on the menu that caught our attention. We finally decided to go with the spinach dip and Caesar salad as our appetizer and for dinner we both got a burger, she got the turkey instead of the beef. the first thing that came out was the Caesar salad which was good but it just didn't have enough dressing and we had to ask for more. Then came the spinach dip which we didn't really like because we felt like it didn't have enough cheese. Last but not least the burgers came and both of them lacked flavor, the best thing about my burgers was the fries and mashed potatoes that we got with them. To make things even worse than what they already were our server did not show us the proper attention, she failed to check on us to see how we were doing, we both went a long period of time with nothing to drink because she failed to check on us and see that we needed refills.

Then when you receive the meager portions of your sides (compared to bar or dine in) the other portion is cold. I ordered chips and guacamole once. They give you a big black container of chips  and literally less then half a cup of guacamole thats so chunky that the flimsy chips cant handle it. Spoke to a female manager and she was nice and gave me a credit.. but for the best customer service .. i would say eat at the bar so you can tell them how they messed up instead of taking  food home and not feeling satisfied. 3 stars.. i wanted to give 2.. but the bar staff was super nice and the place is very clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=180
Lynn B.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",0,13,,2.0,11/26/2016,"Figured I'd try this new restaurant on a Tuesday night. The waitress was awesome (considering her horrible Kitchen and bar colleagues. Our drinks we waited half an hour. Our combo appetizers we waited 45 minutes. The only think that was hot in the plate was the avocado rolls. The mozzarella sticks, spinach dip, and wings were cold. My original mojito was horrible. I had to return it. And I don't like returning stuff. It was the worst mojito ever. I asked the waiter for a popular drink that everyone likes and she suggested a better drink that I liked. The table behind me complained. Rightfully so. The manager was calm And tried to appease the patrons who like us was coming here for the first time. The food was cold. Both our plates. And now I have no idea what my boyfriend got up to tell the hostess. I'm scared. This is terrible service. Are they short staff and there was a holiday rush right before Thanksgiving. I don't think we'll be coming again. I always wish every business the best. I hope you get your act together. Good luck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=180
Charlene D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,,1.0,12/13/2016,The service was TERRIBLE! The food was ridiculously salty and cold. I ordered the jambalaya and was so disappointed! I couldn't taste anything but salt and it was spicy as hell. I told my waitress about the problem and she asked if I'd like to order something else. I said yes and she gave me the menu to browse again. I ended up settling on the shrimp tacos and literally could only stomach one bite!! Again the food was salty! And the slaw was lukewarm. I will definitely never step foot in that place again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=180
Dequan S.,"Town of Oyster Bay, Long Island, NY",16,5,4,1.0,10/12/2016,"On the day of 10/12/16 I ate here at Bj's Restaurant in the new Green Acres Commons. As you walk in the atmosphere is pretty decent, but its way smaller inside then how it looks from the outside. The wait to get a table was about 3 minutes which that was perfect timing because I was hungry. The Hostess seated us at our table and the seats was dirty. It was French Fries on the seats and she was going to get it and i picked it up and handed to her. (The Bust boy needs to do a thorough checking of the table and seats). A couple of minutes later Damali came over to introduce herself as our waitress, very sweet young lady and might I add she is very knowledgable about everything that was being served at the restaurant. We ordered different types of sample beers so we can try, but when I looked and seen Damali put the order in, the bartender took a very long time just to get the samples ready. He was to busy talking and not concentrated on the task at hand. Damali seen that we was getting a little ansi and came over to distract us and have a little side conversation. Which it worked and I commend her for that because she's concerned about the customers well being. We finally get the samples and picked what we wanted. She went and put the order in and we had to yet again wait along time and not to mention this is what they specialize in (Crafted Beers). Our food comes before the beer gets to the table. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad and my friend order the Chicken Alfredo. My salad was very good but his Chicken Alfredo was dry, meaning they was VERY stingy with the Alfredo sauce and some of the pieces of chicken was hard. All in all I will NOT be coming back to this restaurant because I feel the service was a 4 out of 10 and i'm only being nice because of Damali and her customer service. The bartenders LACK the sense of urgency, not to mention the place was not even packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=180
Dan C.,"Dunellen, NJ",0,3,,2.0,12/8/2016,"Ok, well I'm not really in to the whole yelp thing as far as leaving comments anyway. But I'm a truck driver and once in a while I'll stop to try something new. Now first off if you only have 30 minutes for lunch, forget it! And if u think your going to save time by pre-ordering on line, well that's the mistake I made. Since I didn't have a lot of time, I figured I'll do a burger and fries. I ordered it well done and also ordered their large cut fries. They said it would be ready at 12:15. I got there at 12:14. Sat at the bar and waited for at least 10 minutes before I was even acknowledged. Then the bartender who seemed overwhelmed with minimal amounts of customers took another 10 minutes to ask me if I would like a drink. Then, I kid you not! I watched him do other things before another 10 minutes or so went by and I finally got my soda. Another 10 minutes go by and I finally get my food. And it's wrong! They gave me skinny fries, ( MC Donald's are better! ) And the burger was cooked  medium! What was I to do? Almost no time left for lunch now! I ate what I could and left the rest. No one ever came back to ask me if everything came out alright. The flavor of the burger was good. That's the only reason I even gave this place 2 stars. But let's be real. If they can't get a burger and staff right, what makes them think a customer would return for anything else. Good like if your going to try this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=180
Vandana P.,"Jamaica, NY",219,110,207,5.0,1/7/2018,"This spot is located in the newly renovated area of green acres ""commons"". It's pretty big inside, lots of seating choices and a huge bar area.  Drinks: there are soooo many types of drinks you can have here. They have them all displayed, one may get flustered and have a hard time ordering one (me). However they have a some what helpful scale on their menu of beers from light to dark. That really helped me out.  Food: just like the drinks, there is literally everything on this menu. E v e r y t h I n g. Pizza, burgers, fries, steaks, sea food, pasta.. and more. I was so overwhelmed by eventually picked something different from my usual orders. That night they had a special on burgers that included unlimited fries, cool! I assume they have different specials on different nights- just an assumptions.

Laren E.,"Rosedale, NY",83,47,384,1.0,1/10/2018,"So let me start by saying I live in the area and I love brew houses. I visit green acres mall often and decided to give this place a try. I was not pleased at all: Pros:  The staff are very friendly and upbeat, even the Manager. Upon arrival until departure all staff were very nice. The waiter( didn't get her name) was informative about the elaborate menu and offered her suggestions. The bathrooms were very clean. I love a clean bathroom. Its also has a modern look with a unique hand washing fixture.  The décor to the restaurant is very nice and its spacious. The bar setup is stunning and neat. Cons: The restaurant has a smell to it like someone used the same dirty was over and over again to clean the whole place. Also the menus need to be cleaned as the pages stuck together .  My waitress forgot my ENTIRE entrée, as in she took the liberty of suggesting what entrees were good, took down my order, and it never came out. Good thing I ordered an appetizer (will get into that in the next paragraph). When our check came I realized my order was never even on the check which means it was never even taken, which means the waitress must have been doodling on the portable device she was pretending to take my order with. My mother was so shocked but by that time I wasn't.When I received my appetizer I did not receive the pickles as advertised on the menu however the sausage was good . My nephew had mac and cheese which was kraft mac and cheese , and was advertised as such. I thought that maybe they would have brought it up to restaurant quality seeing how much it cost but I was sadly disappointed again and so was my nephew, and he LOVES mac and cheese, and he's 3. I ordered a flight of different beers being that I love beer . EVERY SINGLE BEER was TERRIBLE. My mother ordered a burger and she loved it. I had a small bite, seeing at the time that I was never going to get my entree, and it was actually delicious HOWEVER I will not be returning to this restaurant . I eat all over at green acres mall from Fridays, to Applebee's ,  and Bronx BBQ and I was very disappointed with this place and it was my first time. I just can't take another risk with the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream

The bartender was Brie and she had a sweet personality.  I would've given this spot a 5, but the ribeye I ate was extremely bland. It was as if there was no seasoning at all. But the Wings were good, and so was the Bourbon.  I also appreciate that the staff is diverse and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream
Lesly L.,"New York, NY",1404,90,583,3.0,11/30/2017,"Hey Yelp Family, Coming at you with another review. This one goes to: BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  Very new in Valley Stream, this establishment serves up as a pop in and stay for a while feel. I've only been here twice and don't intend on coming back until the customer service is under control.  One night after a tiring day, I just wanted something to eat and a beer. I knew about this opening for a couple of weeks so I decided to come and check it out. I walked in with my wife and waited to see a hostess and the stand. Wait...Wait...Wait some more and still nothing. At this point it has gone past 5 minutes and no one came to greet us. Much to my surprise, the hostess was in the back chatting and giggling with her workmates. How do I know? As I stood there and wait, I found it kind of odd that a large group of workers were just standing there socializing and it was a busy night. The hostess comes to seats us and before we sat down, we noticed that the table hasn't been turned down. Hostess quickly grabbed someone to clean it down for us. Thank you for that! Now we play the waiting game for our waitress. Busy night, I get that but still not good. They should have the hostess take our drink order or something to that fact. Just a thought... After a whopping 25 minutes, the waitress introduces herself and apologizes for the delay. Her excuse you ask? I thought one of the other people up-front were covering this table.. My response? Oh you mean the 7 people hanging at the hostess station? She laughs.... I cringe some more because my tummy is ready to get BUSY! She takes our drink order, and asked me what I wanted to eat. I told her her: the salmon on a bed of quinoa. She makes a joke as i return the laugh and she ""writes down the order"". At this point, she is checking up on us frequently to make sure we are ok. Cool! She comes in and checks some more.. and more... and more... No plate in her hand. I stopped her and asked what was the update on my food. Just as soon as she said that, my wife's dish comes out. Where is mine you ask? I asked the waitress the same thing and she then replies: Oh you were serious about the salmon on the bed of quinoa? Ever see in the cartoons where they get pissed off and smoke blows out the ear? Well... this slowly started to happen. I immediately asked for the manager. No more games! The manager quickly comes to my table and offers an apology and gives me a glass of wine on the house and comps our bill. If I could remember his name, I would definitely tag him. But I don't so Thank you manager! At this point, my wife is upset that I didn't get my food so she decided not to eat. Isn't she lovely? Isn't that loyalty? If you're looking for a last minute spot to go and kickback, I wouldn't recommend coming here. Who knows, maybe they've changed.... Well until next time yelp family: keep on yelp'n!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream

No one drank their cocktails because it tasted horrible which was upsetting since we had to wait for one of the drinks because they ran out of glasses.

Wesley M.,"Hollis, NY",7,34,53,3.0,11/12/2017,"When it comes to service there needs to be huge improvements made here. Upon walking in and informing the hostess of the party size there was nothing else communicated. No ""a table is being cleaned,"" ""it will be a x minute wait,"" nothing. After sitting, and waiting to be called we watched as others came in and were seated. Making sure we weren't ""forgotten"" I ask the hostess how long the wait would be to then find out the table we were waiting on to be cleaned (unknown to us) was still not cleaned. It was the manager who jumped in and cleaned the table. Much respect to that manager as well who took the time to greet each and every guest.  After finally be seated we order the avocado egg roll, cherry chipotle boneless wings and a nashville hot chicken sandwich. I really enjoyed the egg rolls and would be back just for that. Whatever the sauce is that's served with that dish is great! The wings portion was huge and the sauce was pretty good. There wasn't anything special I found about the sandwich. The chicken was however moist, juicy and not dry. There are a lot of menu options and it can seem overwhelming, but there's literally something for everybody. I have not ruled this place out, but the service needs to be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream

We started with cheese dip which was good I had to stop myself. I ordered the Santa  Fe salad and my bf ordered the quinoa bowl with shrimp his food was bland but its quinoa so duh?

Marissa M.,"JAMAICA, NY",519,437,1152,2.0,9/24/2017,"I was very excited to try BJ's after it opened at the new shopping center Green Acres Commons however, my dining experience here yesterday has helped me reach a final decision to never return again.  When we arrived I was blown away by the size of this place and the modern warehouse fixtures were very alluring. This is your family restaurant meets brew house. I would recommend this place ONLY for the brews. Nothing more. If you want good food, cook at home and buy a 6 pack of Corona. We were greeted by the staff who were pleasant and accommodating. I reviewed the menu like I was studying for the SAT's. I decided on the blended brew ""Red Apple"" a mix of a angry orchard style brew with another house favorite. This was very delicious. Very crisp and it had a nice punch to it. It was the only thing I enjoyed. Our waitress arrived and she aimed to please. She and the waitstaff brought out everything on time. We were dining with 3 children and their food came out first. The children's menu offers a plethora of different menu items and sides for the children's prices at $6.85. My daughter ordered cheeseburger sliders which appeared edible.  The trouble occurred when we ordered the ""Avocado Eggrolls"". These were not good at all. What arrived to our table were 6 Tortillas wrapped in what the Manager described as ""cream cheese"", with sliced Avocado. No seasoning. None of the ingredients listed on the menu. No cilantro, no peppers. Just a slice of avocado in a cold tortilla. Correct me if I am wrong, that is NOT an egg roll. I asked the waitress if these could be substituted or taken off of our bill due to the disappointment. She summoned a manager who was an older Latino man who without a name tag and failed to introduce himself. He approached our table very frazzled and clearly bothered by our complaint. He asked what the issue was. I explained that the ""egg rolls"" were not good and that they do not fit the description of the appetizer listed on the menu.  Strike 1: He aggressively and in defense mode responded ""They are not good ? Or YOU do not like them ?!!"" I was seated with family, including children. I stared at him at this point. I repeated They are not good. None of the ingredients named on the menu are included on this item. (This is now your opportunity to recreate the menu item as it's described or give me my money back) STRIKE 2:  He proceeds to debate with me with a very condescending tone. ""You are mistaken. There is cream cheese...."" I see you ate half the order.  Let's do some math!  There are 6 terrible Eggrolls.  There are 5 people at the table. 3 people ate 1 Eggroll. Three are now 3 remaining.  I ate 1 sir. I wouldn't dare consume another.  Strike 3: He then in frustration removes the item and says he will remove it from the bill.  The first lesson in running any form of business is  1. The customer is always right !  Perhaps he needs a refresher course. How dare you debate me. How dare you argue with a customer while dining with family. The rest of the meal was terrible. I ordered a sirloin steak for $19.50. The meat was as tough as a leather belt. I was curious to try dessert but decided this establishment will not rob me of another penny or any of my family time. I witnessed another customer returning what appeared to be a very cold burger to the same manager. I witnessed him take care of that right away without a condescending tone.  If you want to enjoy dinner and drinks, Bronx BBQ is just across the parking lot. I know the manager there and he values his paying customers that have kept his business open for 10+ years. I don't foresee BJ's sticking around for too long if customers are treated so poorly and the dining experience is lackluster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream

I had a derby salad and my husband had a brisket bbq burger. Portions are big enough to take home left overs. Service needs improvement.

My friend had a cocktail but forgot the name.  Once the final guest arrived we requested a table and was seated immediately. One of the ladies been here before and loved the wings. Our waitress was welcoming and helpful on suggestions.  We decided to go with the Wings (flavorful), String French Fries(yelp recommendation), and Avocado Egg Rolls(crunchy, not greasy) as an appetizers. As for entrees we had the Blacken Atlantic Salmon(cooked good), Chicken Alfredo, and Cheese/Tomato Deep Dish Pizza. I decided to order another beer (Pear Cider, very refreshing).

S M.,"Uniondale, NY",0,13,,3.0,11/26/2016,"I went to this restaurant on a whim.  I had never been to this establishment before so I thought it would be nice to try something new.  Let's talk about the good stuff.  I was able to be seated right away with my family.  The menu has tons of choices so it took some time to decide what to order but I like having plenty of options.  I decided to play it safe and I ordered a jalapeno burger with fries.  It was REALLY good.  I enjoyed my food.  It came out hot and yummy.  My family members also enjoyed their food.  It was great.  The prices were fair.  Now for the bad stuff.  The service left a lot to be desired.  Our waitress did a good job taking our drink and meal order.  Then she basically disappeared.  She did not refresh our drinks and was gone for about 15-20 minutes.  I didn't think anything about it but I was hoping I would see her to refresh our drinks while we waited for our food.  Eventually our food came out. My family member's burger had no cheese and I was not brought the pickles I requested.  My family member had asked for mozzarella cheese originally.  When we said there is not cheese on this burger the waitress said oh we don't have that type of cheese.  Uh you couldn't tell us that before??  Okay we asked for different cheese, a refreshing of our drinks and pickles.  The waitress brought the burger and drinks but no pickles.  After eating, we wanted to order dessert.  The waitress took our empty plates and said she would be right back.  She did not come back for about 10 minutes which was very annoying.  I then started to notice that most of the waiters and waitresses were all basically standing around talking with each other.  We were right near the registers and we noticed there were about 6 workers just standing, talking and playing around for the rest of the time we were there.  I finally spotted my waitress and noticed she was busy talking to another worker near the kitchen door!!  She finally came back and we ordered dessert.  We told her we were sharing dessert.  She forgot extra spoons and had to go back to get spoons which of course took her a couple of minutes.  She never came back to get the check.  I asked someone else to do it for us.  She finally came back when we started putting on our coats and she asked could she help us pay.  We told her we did already.  I did not leave her a great tip which was interesting for us because we tip very well when we have great service.  Her lost ( I never did get those pickles) but the manager really needs to either toughen up on these workers or hire some people that will pay attention to the paying customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=200

Someone came over said they would be with us in a minute, so we waited, waited, continued to wait, someone came over again, said they would be with us in a few, and we waited some more. We even told the waitress that we were waiting for about 15 minutes and she got upset, at US, for telling her. So we decided to continue to wait, asked the bartender if we could get help, she asked a group of waitress that congregated by their POS system and they all looked at us like if we were imposing on their personal time. After waiting for 30 minutes, without receiving any type of service, we left to BWW. If you want to go to a cool looking place, to hang out and kill time before going to BWW this is the place to go.

Scott W.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,6,,4.0,10/30/2016,I'll start with the negative to get it out of the way. The service was terribly slow. It was busy. But not 2-2 1/2 hour busy. The wait time was only 15 minutes. The service was the only reason I gave 4 stars.  The food was very good. The selection of beers on tap was amazing.  No complaints about food or beverages. I will definitely give it another shot,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=200
Darren M.,"Rosedale, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/25/2016,If I could give this place zero stars I would because I have been sitting at the table for the past 45 mins and have yet to even give my order the staff are unprofessional and don't have any regards about their customer perception of the business being it is a new establishment. Regardless of the quality of the food the service makes the dining experience utterly disgusting.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=200
Steven H.,"Garden City, NY",0,4,,1.0,3/7/2017,"i  only gave one star since the food was good.  i have never had such bad service.  my sled and my wife went to BJ's on Friday and used their their call a head seating and we were told we would sit at 8 and we finally got the text at 8 43 so that how our experience started. we sat for 10 minn and that server final came over,  she said she will be right back and  another 15 minn went buy.  she finally came over and took our order.  the food came out and was good but it took till our dinner for us to get drinks.  i order the parm crusted chicken and when it came the broccoli was rotten.  when i showed the server she just said sorry and would i like some more.  the thing that got me was never did a manager come over. So we then ordered desserts that was the reason we went my wife's friend told her about them.  so we got the 3 cookie one when it came out it looked great. i took a bite of the monkey bread one and started chewing and spit out a large piece of plastic from my mouth.  one i found my server ( one of the hardest thing to do ) i showed her the plastic and she gave us the biggest attitude and very snippy said you want another.  i was so done with this i sad just bring me the check.  so she did.  yet again no manager came over to us to say anything.  amazing that they dont care they were both just standing around talking to their employees.  But this was just the start.  they did not take the dessert off the bill so instead of causing even more of a problem i just paid the bill and left.  i then went home and e mailed their corporate office and explained what went down and i got no response if this is how they treat their guest that spend almost 100 dollars they would be around for long. you know what they say when you have a good time dinning you tell 2 or 3 people that they need to try this place when you have a bad time you tell everyone,  witch i have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=200
Sabrina C.,"Valley Stream, NY",169,4,,4.0,4/4/2017,I'm only giving 4 stars for there craft beer selection. But the service I would give 2 stars slowest staff you know it's bad if you have a manager bringing your food and drinks out.

Sadaf M.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",95,8,3,3.0,1/13/2017,"Friday night- service was quick. The server who brought us to our table was rude, she didn't even greet us, brought us to our table, gave us our menus and walked off. Ordered artichoke and spinach dip and sriracha brussels sprouts for apps which were really good. I then ordered the jambalaya for dinner, which I wasn't pleased with. Too much salt, the tomatoes on the dish were canned, it kinda looked sloppy. Like something I would've made when in college while dorming, an experimental dish. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Our main server for the night was really nice. My overall experience was meh. Would I come back? Probably not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=140

I went there a farewell dinner for my partner that was being deployed... slowest service ever.  Waiter was very attentive but took almost an hour for our food to come out.  My 9 year olds food was still not ready.  Chicken fingers and French fries came out 15 mins after our food but the manager comped it....probably will not return was not my first visit.  Every time it's very slow with luke warm food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=140
Dominiqua M.,"Jamaica, NY",224,21,17,5.0,2/21/2017,"Came here with a good friend of mine who've been here plenty of times since it's opened. I have to say, I loved it. We sat at the bar where we had an amazing bartender, Shawna ! She recommended me drinks and she knew exactly what I liked . I love the white peach margarita!!! She took our food and drink orders and let's just say, I was pleasantly surprised at how efficient everything was! I was impressed. My deep dish penne was a little dry but I think that was just me being picky because it's tasted sooo good ! Lol the root beer wings are EVERYTHING!!!! Also shoutout to another server Nicole!!! She was working that place!!!! Overall, staff is very hardworking and just amazing!! Food and drinks are great! Ambiance is lovely! Prices are good! & I Appreciate the variety!

Danii D.,"Elmont, NY",15,80,8,5.0,11/2/2016,"I went here with my husband and we really enjoyed ourselves. Our waiter Brian was one of the best waiters we've had at a restaurant. He was knowledgeable about all the beers on the menu and gave some great recommendations. The customer service here was not like the typical horrid Applebees, Olive Garden or Red Lobster that are in the area. And to top it off the food was really tasty and it matched perfectly with all the beers Brian recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=140
Meggi M.,"Mineola, NY",0,15,2,4.0,1/2/2017,Pretty good place for a quick bite. Probably because it's new but it's very clean. Waitress we're very nice. Lots of TVs. I'd go back again. Menu is similar to a Friday's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=140
Maria C.,"Town of Hempstead, Long Island, NY",0,4,1,2.0,12/27/2016,Food is below average for the price. We ordered the chile salsa verde dip and it was very cheesy- less chile. But the chips were really bad- oily and stale. The tuna seared salad didn't come as advertised- was poorly thrown together. My husband was happy with his burger and beer but fries were greasy  the jalapeño margarita was yummy. So my recommendation is to stick with basics and don't expect much.  The service is trying - server was nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=140

If you happen to come here and have Amira (i believe that was her name )as a waiter just leave like she's just so rude. Me and my bf came here tonight, in the process of getting we saw a booth opened and asked if we can sit there we got the booth. A really nice girl came gave us our menus and left, another girl came said you were sitting there and came here I'm your server in the rudest way ever. Okayyy?? We order appetizers and drinking the appetizers came out in no time but we still had no drinks ... we stopped another server walking by asked her for our server , she finally came over with the drink and was like yes? With the rudest attitude again. We couldn't do it anymore just walked for the check and got the eff outta there. Girllll  I get it everyone has a bad day but stop taking out on your customers.

Star D.,"Queens, NY",24,5,,3.0,1/16/2017,"I really wanted to love this place since it's fairly new but I have to say it left a lot to be desired. We waited about 20 mins which wasn't bad for a Saturday night. We ordered boneless buffalo wings which were dry but good. We also had the spinach dip which was ok. I had the fire barbacoa chicken which came with brown rice and black beans. Can you say tasteless? Bleh. I could barely eat it and had to share my husband's food. He had steak and fries which was good. I was hungry so we blazed through his meal. I was scared to try anything else, so we skipped dessert. She must've known I didn't like it. My plate was full when we left. My husband's meal bumped it up a star. The waitress tried.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=140

Gingee L.,"Valley Stream, NY",7,11,14,1.0,12/30/2016,"Thursday night, party of 6.  Was pretty busy, but not crazy.  It was my first time, and because this place just opened and it appeared to be a cool joint with a fun vibe, I was so disappointed.  The service was horrible.  We were stuck with a waitress that had an attitude and wasn't attentive at all.  It took her 20 min to bring us water and drinks.  When we finally got our food (salads) we realized we had no utensils.  We had to wait another 7-10 min AFTER getting our food to get utensils!  What if our food had been hot?  This is a no, no.  What's worse is that we asked immediately for them, got a strange look and was told we had to wait (while she took another table's order).  The food was nothing fantastic.  For what they charge, they need to train their wait staff better.  That will be the first and last time I step foot on that place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=140

Earl G.,"Rosedale, NY",19,10,11,3.0,12/2/2016,"Im a tough critic to restaurants as my chefing skills are better than most. Hence not really impressed with restaurants. First impression being there only once. Service is better than the food. Average portions. Staff, in general, very nice. But u'll always have those few that have the attitude of really not caring they have a job. They don't offer bread while u wait for food. Unfortunately every one at the table sat there starving. But clean, comfortable, nicely decorated, and relatively quiet atmosphere despite the pub area. If they plan to stay they need more pizzazz in their food menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream?start=140
