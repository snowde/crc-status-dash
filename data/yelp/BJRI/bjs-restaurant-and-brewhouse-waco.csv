Mary S.,"San Antonio, TX",116,64,86,4.0,10/18/2017,BJ's in Waco is a pretty safe visit. The restaurant was clean and the staff were friendly. We waited maybe 10 minutes for a table of 2 on a Sunday evening. Our waiter talked entirely way too fast but reassured us that he wasn't rushing us.  The food is consistently good. We ordered pizza - barbecue chicken (deep dish) and the chicken bacon ranch (thin crust). The pizza was cooked well-maybe not fully as the thin crust was a bit chewy. The ingredients tasted fresh.  They have an extensive beer menu. I ordered the pumpkin shandy! I enjoy more fruity beers so it was amazing for me. Cold beer always makes for a good time. Especially with pizza!  I have heard amazing things about the pizookie but I wasn't able to try it this trip!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco
Logan K.,"San Francisco, CA",14,34,2,1.0,12/16/2017,"Sat at the bar and order a bacon cheeseburger. The dollar more to add bacon meant I got two wilted, fragile, microwave bacon strips. Burger came with no sauce - no mayo, ketchup, mustard nothing. But it was piled high with iceberg lettuce to give the appearance of heftiness. The fries were cold. I had to track salt down from another table. Asked for ketchup - waited a while and got an empty bottle from the bartender who called me 'bro'.  Asked for a glass of water. Never got it. Asked for a napkin and utensils. Bartender asked if I was done with my plate and replied, 'sweet'. Upside: have 9-10 drinks here. You'll still be able to drive home. This is where you take your spouse when your marriage has gotten stale and you aren't getting laid anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco
Chloe H.,"Dallas, TX",11,73,2,1.0,11/29/2017,"I usually get the same order when it's To-Go. This recent last time I guess they maybe do not want me placing online orders anymore. My burger buns were rock hard like a brick. The burger was super dry with no spread, as I asked for extra which I didn't get. My salad had chicken on it sparingly and it was frozen! With the wrong dressing that I never get because allergic. The salad was almost $14. I didn't wish to phone in but I couldn't understand why someone thought this was serviceable in any way plus for nearly $26. The guy who was apparently overseeing things that night appeared to not be that concerned. I didn't think it was that hard to fix. I was placed on hold forever. Then he just goes ""well, do you want us to remake it???"" It was said like I shouldn't have called about it. I said I'm far away and I'm hungry right now. He never offered any other remedy for this jacked up order. He never seemed to put forth any concern one bit that I paid nearly $30 and couldn't eat any of it and I couldn't just drive 35 mins back over there. He placed me on hold once again so I just hung up. Made me a meal out of my frig for dinner with scraps (since it was the day before I went grocery shopping) and had to consider it a loss.  I will not be back to this BJ's location anytime soon, especially for To-Go so they can throw you the weak food and run.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco
Jennifer H.,"Dallas, TX",28,179,97,2.0,1/28/2017,"I stopped in for dinner on a Friday night at 6:30.  The restaurant was already crowded with a 25 minute wait for a table for 6.  The hostess asked if we'd be okay sitting at the bar instead and we agreed that would be okay.  Four us sat down and were ready to wait a few minutes for the other two.  Our waitress came by quickly and took our drink order.  When she returned with our beverages we asked for another 10 minutes.  it took 40 for her to come back by and actually check on us again.   We did order and the food was fine, but the 40 minute wait was really annoying.  Yes, it was busy in the bar.  Yes, we did ask for a few more minutes so the rest of our party could join us before we ordered.  But to have to wait that long should not happen.  We nearly walked out on our tab because of it.  Advice to the manager- have at least one more waitress in the bar on the busiest nights because clearly two wasn't enough and we were overlooked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco

Our waiter didn't seem to understand proper timing. He bugged us a lot at the beginning, was slow to deliver the check, and kept walking away while we were talking. Also, he spilled water. Everywhere. My wife's thyme chicken was also disappointing. Though the flavor was good, the chicken felt like the inside of a McDonald's chicken nugget.

We were told several times the wait was ""just a few more minutes,"" but after over an hour and a half, we took our business elsewhere. Would have been fine with a long wait, however, we had made a reservation well in advance.

The salad was delivered prior to everyone's meal, I kindly asked that it be served when everyone's meal was served and with the soup. Waitress was happy to do so. Tomato basil soup was amazing. Regretted it was served NOT served with a cracker or roll of some kind. It was topped with 3 thumbnail size croutons. The BLT salad was a mess. Tiny diced bits of tomato and bacon (actually the bacon reminded me of packaged bacon bits, real bacon though way too small to enjoy.). The green was spinach leaves which still had their stems attached. It would have been much better to have had the stems removed. I would order the soup again but would not order the BLT salad again.

The last time we were in the food and service was terrible.  I was so disappointed and to top it off my family was in town and all I did before the visit was rave about how good this place is.  We got our appetizer, and after realizing something huge was missing off of the plate, we realized it was the chips for the dip.  Service just dropped the plate off and left, not explaining why were weren't given chips for our dip (that I also happened to RAVE about.) so instead when our server came we were left to ask about it, and he explained that they were out of chips.  Oh, ok. Well, can we have something ELSE to use the dip with? They wanted to charge us for bits of bread, then we settled on a few ""breadsticks"" they use for pasta for free.  seriously. We just blew 17$ on this appetizer and there are no chips, and the rest of the appetizer was luke warm...  Once I got my plate of food, my fries were cold, and my burger was also luke warm.  I asked for more fries for my plate but by the time they got there I was half way through my burger.  My parents plates and my husbands weren't much better, and we were left looking like chumps for saying this place was so great. The only time I've had great experiences here at the place was on a Saturday night, or a busy Sunday night.  The cook working the busy times is awesome.   When they're busy, they're worth the wait.  If there is no wait, there is probably a reason why.  Weak food, weak service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=40

One of the only exceptions of course is customer service. We visited tonight, a Sunday evening, around 8:30-8:45ish. It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us, understandable to a degree with two large tables of college students still being waited on right next to us. However, our waitress Ashley was unapologetic about her slowness to greet us or get our drink order. We told her we were actually ready to order everything, aware that we might not have another opportunity to do so for a while later and to make things easier on her since she was obviously having a rough night. Long story short, she continued to be flippant and cold towards us the rest of the evening with intermittent moments of kindness for instance after we had to seek out silverware and later when the bill arrived of course. In summary, I'm only writing this review to make the management aware of this behavior of a staff member.

Deandrea P.,"Waco, TX",59,7,2,1.0,3/13/2016,"We came to BJs to have a quick dinner for my girlfriend's 21st and it was definitely one of the worst experiences we've had. We typically enjoy BJs and come here often, I'm not sorry to say that we won't be dining here again. My girlfriend ordered a cocktail and burger and we had brussel sprouts for an appetizer. The sprouts were burnt to a char, basically inedible. We told our waiter about it and he very casually just shrugged it off without asking if we wanted something else or wanted to get us more sprouts. Then the burger. On the first bite she took out of her burger, she immediately gagged and spit it out. There was a piece of wax paper the size of a post-it note. She even had managed to swallow some of it. She took her plate to the manager, Jeremy, who did not express sincerity whatsoever. Just gave excuses as to what may have happened in the kitchen. You would think that after such an incident a manager would show compassion and at least make the guest feel comfortable. The rest of the dinner was wasteful, all of our appetites were ruined. The manager never made a round back to the table to check or reassure if we were okay. Plus, they had forgotten to send out the birthday pazookie that was well deserved. Not to mention the service was slow. Edit: she talked to the manager, his excuse was that service was slow. I doubt that since the entire time he sat himself at the bar with another person repeatedly throughout our dinner, you can see him (purple shirt) in the attached picture. Also notice the obvious ""crowd"" showing BJ's too busy on a Sunday night.  Please avoid this establishment. It's obvious in the other reviews the management here is shot, not to mention that someone else was served burnt brussel sprouts.

My husband started with the Nutty Brewnette which he really liked, and then had Jeremiah Red, which he liked even better.

Seth J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",39,55,13,3.0,5/25/2015,"I almost gave BJ's4 stars, as I do really like them, and generally enjoy myself eating there. I just couldn't do it though. This trip, the service was decidedly sub-par, with the blame lying squarely on the waitress. Long wait between being seated and greeted, drink refills were rare, etc.  When at BJ's we always get the avocado egg roll appetizer. Yum.  The husband and I both ordered Cajun dishes this time, and it is clear that the kitchen didn't truly understand Cajun food. All the right elements and flavors were there, but both dishes lacked that little oomph that makes Cajun so special.  The biggest reason I cannot give BJ's the fourth star is inconsistency. Some of their dishes on the menu are decidedly above-average. Their ahi tuna salad, for example, is (was? It's been a while since we've ordered one) stellar. Sadly, other dishes are just average. I've not had anything bad, per se, but some things we've had are just ok at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=20

When I first read the reviews on this place, I knew I might (will) encounter terrible service. But I did not believe it would be this bad. I knew it would be bad when people were MISSING from the hostess stand. We waited there for a bit, and then were seated. Where quickly again, our waiter seemed to be MISSING. After 15 minutes of waiting, we were all ready to order. And still NO ONE came. When the waiter finally came after who knows when, we quickly told him our whole order and drinks included (because it wasn't taken earlier yet). Our appetizer of fried calamari came, but we didn't have plates to eat it on. Are we suppose to eat it on the table? I think not.  Throughout our meal, waters were not refilled and we watched as our waiter slowly take his time with only 2 other tables. At the end, we ended up waiting for our bill much longer than it took us to eat both our appetizer and 4 entrees. He gave us our bill and we quickly put our credit card in. But once again, our waiter went MISSING. And once again, we waited.  Honestly, the food was not bad. ($81 for a soup in sourdough, pasta, mahi mahi, full rack of ribs, fried calamari).

It took almost an hour to get our food and the place wasn't even half full. They didn't even serve our food at the same time, I had the privilege of watching my friends eat for 10 mins before I was served.

I've been there about five times in the past year and I have yet to have great service. I've had good service but they always seem to be in a rush, half zoned-out, and slow on refills. The food is also getting bad. I ordered a Cesar salad with grilled chicken and the chicken was burned to a crisp. It took so long to get it that I didn't bother correcting it. Another day, I ordered the chicken parmigiana. The marinara sauce was so spicy that I had to stop eating and give the rest to my boyfriend. I am VERY sensitive to spice and did not expect that with an Italian dish. I've watched the movie Waiting too many times to complain about food and, once again, I was Starvin' Marvin when I received my food. (Yes, I'm a wimp).

David L.,"Waco, TX",2,10,,1.0,9/16/2012,"I don't usually rate restaurants this low, but my experience at this particular BJ's in Waco, Texas was not even remotely pleasant. I went to BJ's on September 16, 2012 with a group of friends. My friend recommended it based upon his experiences with another BJ's in Sugarland, Texas. He said that they were well known for their pizza, so we decided to order some pizzas, three in fact. After receiving our pizzas, however, we were not impressed in any way. Not only was the pizza not ""deep-dish"" as the menu proclaimed, but its quality looked very average, on par with Pizza Hut. Normally, I wouldn't complain too much, but the pizza cost $20. I could get the same pizza for $10 at Pizza Hut. There were mistakes in the cooking of the pizza, there were parts of the pizza, like the onions, that were still raw. However, our group recognized that mistakes do happen. We decided to just inform the waitress instead, just to express our concern. The service, however, was not great at all. Even though the restaurant has only been open for a month or two, it should be well established by now, but the manager kept giving us odd excuses for the conditions of our pizzas. He stated that they no longer serve their pizzas in a pan, but instead serve them on a dish because it ""keeps the pizza warmer for longer"", which makes little sense to me. Not only that, he stated later on that the pizzas we received were indeed deep dish. I'm from Chicago, and I know that that was not a deep dish pizza. The tomato sauce was not on the top, and the pizza was by no means thick enough. The manager seemed to give us excuses and lies, which I don't understand. He did not seem to like our constructive criticism, but instead seemed to become defensive. In the end, they gave us a discount on the meal, which I respect, but with that bad combination of service and quality. I don't think I'll be coming back. This is not to say the franchise is bad, but this particular chain, I would avoid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=60
KG P.,"Waco, TX",0,3,,1.0,8/17/2015,"We had a party of group of 11 at BJ's to celebrate a birthday. It was my nephews 21st birthday, and since he enjoys BJ's pizza, this was his choice. Instead of a celebration it turned into a calamity. It all started at the bar. 730 on a Sunday evening the only people waiting at the bar were the 6 men in our group. The bartender Dean, ignored the group staying at the far end of the bar, with his back turned, pretending he did not see us. However upon entering we made eye contact with Dean, however Dean disregarded the group, turned his back, walking away from our group. We are not a group of undesirable customers; we own small business, one is a fireman, civil engineer, and one is a banker.  Not wanting to be bothered with his customers, Dean rushed pass the group, and disappeared in the back area of the restaurant.  After 5 minutes, yea we timed him, he rushed back in behind the bar, ran to the far end of the bar, and spit tobacco juice into a cup. At that point with noticeable regret, surly body language, and lack of concern, he made his way down to our group. I asked him his name, he asked ""why you want my name"", I said because we want to make sure we know who to pay. Dean then informed us he would be right back, and again disappeared into the kitchen. This time he reappeared only a few seconds later, and reluctantly, and unpleasantly took our drink orders, which were just some craft beers. At that point a manger appeared, I asked her what Dean's problem was and she said I will have a talk with him later. She was aware and acknowledged Dean's attitude. She should have sent him home. Maybe she didn't have a replacement, however I would suspect managers could pour beer and make a few cocktails.  Dean should not be serving customers. If he wants to be this hipster bartender servicing craft cocktails, with an attitude, he needs to find another place to work. The attitude does not work in a family casual restaurant. He needs to be terminated.  So we make it to our table and our adventure continues. Megan our server was nice enough, and pleasant, however she struggled with the orders. Half the tables food came out before any one received their appetizers, (we canceled the appetizers) carried by servers, just looking to dump the orders on the table, asking who ordered this and who ordered that, no clue, no direction, clumsily looking at greased stained order tickets, not even knowing what they were carrying. No management, no direction, no training.  So half the group sat around for 15 minutes +/- waiting for their others (including the person celebrating his birthday), while the others in the group sat politely waiting to eat their food only when the other orders appeared. 15 minutes later the other food arrived, and guess what a few of the orders were incorrect. We asked Megan if they were short staffed or overwhelmed with business (there might have been 50 people in the restaurant), she answered no to both questions. We asked about Dean the angry bartender, who hates his job, hates the customers, and seems bothered about serving customers. She said he's like that with everyone, that his girlfriend is a manager here. Now we know why his behavior is allowed.  What a great night at BJ's. At this point the manager, came out apologized, and handed everyone in our group ""courtesy cards"". Wouldn't it be nice, not to have to hand out ""courtesy cards"", just make the dining experience as pleasant as possible up front. Start by terminating Dean. Find a kitchen manager to manage the kitchen effectively, find employees who care about their tips and serving customers correctly. Just remember we live in Waco, and look what happened at Twin Peaks, and the investment dollars lost, and the reputation of a restaurant chain forever stained.     We have eating a tBJ's around the county for a number of years.  We live in Waco, and have pride in our community. I have clients who come to town and spend up to a week in Waco. They ask for restaurant recommendations the company always recommends BJ's. We have considered BJ's for our office catering. Unfortunately due to Dean, and the unpleasant experience on a slow Sunday night, we have to reconsider our opinion of BJ's.  My hope is someone at BJ's with direction, authority, and appreciation for the customer reads this and take action. Again Dean is a liability, he will not make the site money, and Dean will cause customers to stay away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=60
Tony B.,"Belton, TX",51,19,14,5.0,6/19/2012,"With any brand new opening of a big chain like this there are bound to be hiccups. I was pleasantly surprised at the complete and total lack of these hiccups on my first visit to the newly constructed BJ's in Waco. There was about a 10 minute wait around 1pm which isn't a huge deal. We had apparently just missed the huge lunch rush. From the moment I walked in the door every single hostess, waiter/waitress, buster, and bartender put off a vibe that they wanted to be there and wanted to make sure I left happy. Dominique (hopefully that's spelled correctly!) did an outstanding job as our waitress. She used the perfect balance of making sure our glasses never went less than half full, but not checking on us to the point of being annoying.  We got the avocado egg-rolls as an appetizer. I'm sure you hear people say this about many of the menu items here, but as crazy as it sounds it's actually quite delicious! Dipping them in the provided sauce is a must. I also got the Chicken Tortilla Soup which they actually bring out in two separate containers. The plate has a small pile of shredded tortilla chips, avocado, a lime wedge, and some seasonings. They then pour the soup over the small pile so when you eat it the tortilla chips are still slightly crunchy. It had an awesome slightly spicy flavor. I also had the light chicken tacos which were also quite tasty. Their signature desert is essentially a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice-cream on top which was delicious as well. Wow... after re-reading this I sound like a huge fatty! The wait time for the food was surprisingly short given the large volume of people in the restaurant. I also take every chance I get to try new beers, and got the Hopstorm. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I did the Porter I tried at my last visit to BJ's in Temple, but I'm not really much of an IPA guy. They have over a dozen (i think?) of their own brews. If you want to try a bunch of them you can build a sampler which I highly recommend. I'm glad to see some fresh competition for all the other big chains in Waco. I have no doubt this place will give them a run for their money. Definitely plan on making myself a regular here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=60

Normally you'd think you'd find a few here and there and have it mostly be cheese. Not here. There was so many toppings that they were falling off the plate and I was eating them with my fork.  The only downside was that the hostess who showed us to our table was a tad creepyish. She walked really slow and was a bit robotic.

We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=80
Amy B.,"Austin, TX",45,2,,1.0,6/19/2015,"This was a horrible experience. The waitress was more interested in the family behind us. The first glass that I was served  broke as I picked it up.  They quickly cleaned it up, and a manager told us that is was not our fault and that they did not mind cleaning up after the spill ????? We waited for about 15 minutes to get another drink ordered, and another 10 to order our food. We then spent the next 40 minutes waiting on our food that we ordered. (Mind you still soaking wet with the drink that had spilled on me.) The waitress never checked on us, until we were ready to just go. Then told us that the food we ordered takes 20 minutes to cook, which is fine but we had ordered it 40 minutes prior. I told her we were pretty much ready to leave money on the table and walk out, she walked away and said she was sorry while looking the other way.  Then promptly walked back to continue to converse with the table behind us. I then told my husband it was time to go. We left an adequate amount of money on the table and told her we were just going to go. She then said oh sorry dear. I thought that this was a bit lacking in guest service. I understand if you are busy it taking a while, however in my past experience as a waitress I would have engaged with my table more than once to ensure there was not anything else they needed, especially if I had been right there talking to a table behind them. I can not believe how disappointing the service was at this location. I would have given it a 0 star but it was not an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=80
Jennifer K.,"Hewitt, TX",2,17,3,2.0,8/7/2014,"Food is overpriced and mediocre at best. Drinks and beer are very good. Service is hit or miss; sometimes good, but usually poor; very slow and inattentive. The female wait staff is much better then their male counterparts. For the money you spend the service really needs to improve. My suggestion is to get drinks at the bar and go someplace else for food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=80
Christopher B.,"Stafford, TX",36,97,5,3.0,3/3/2014,"Over the past year I have gone here about 4 times. The last two times since about July, I have had a fairly average time. The service is where this place lacks. Waiter does not stop by often to offer refills. The food can be overcooked (pasta).

Mark S.,"Woodway, TX",0,30,2,3.0,7/22/2013,"I have always enjoyed eating at BJs.  Went this past weekend and as usual the food was very good.  I asked the waiter to let us enjoy our drinks and appetizer but he kept coming over pushing us to order.  We were there early, no crowd at all and he kept pushing us to order.  Went in with plans to have a leisurely meal but ended up like going through a drive through.  Entre arrived before we had finished our small appetizer.  I will go back because I like the food and beer but I won't allow them to rush me again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=80

Dolly D.,"Waco, TX",0,6,6,3.0,10/7/2012,Avocado egg roll was great...dipping sauce put it over the top!  Amanda made our visit very pleasant.  The horseradish sauce for the roast beef dip was exceptional.   However it was a very pricey.  $2.75 for sweet tea!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=80

Sarah F.,"Washington, DC",0,15,,2.0,6/17/2012,"The restaurant has only been open for about a week, and we went on Fathers' Day, so it was very busy. The service was terrible. We were seated and got our drink orders in a timely fashion, and we ordered our food not too long after we had gotten there.  However, we then had to wait for almost an hour for our food to arrive (there were six of us). When it arrived, two of the orders had something wrong (wrong side, incorrectly cooked) and one was missing. Two more were, while not cold, not hot either. We then had to wait another ten minutes for the missing order to arrive, and it arrived only after we had spoken to a manager about that and the incorrectly-cooked steak.  The food was quite good, if a little cold, and I expect that many of these issues will be resolved as the restaurant ages. I will say that the manager was very helpful once we spoke to him and he discounted our check to compensate for our trouble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=80
April C.,"Elm Mott, TX",0,4,2,1.0,7/15/2012,"Went here early on a Saturday before it got busy. We were seated right away but waited forever just to get our drinks. While waiting for our food, we witnessed 2 tables ask for the manager because of not getting their order or repeatedly getting the wrong order. We ordered pizza and the waitress gave us dirty plates and the ""fresh from the oven"" pizza was cold. Needless to say, I will gladly spend my $60 elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=80
David L.,"Waco, TX",223,869,119,4.0,4/16/2013,"The 'neighborhood' bar & grill concept has entered a new era, catering to those who tire of burger-based menus, tacky things on walls, and mass-produced beers. They still want a place to watch the game, but they want to feel grown up doing it. Restaurants like BJ's, Gordon Biersch, and Dogfish Head are seeking to fill this glorified sports bar niche. BJ's brings together Americans' newfound taste for microbrews and their enduring appetite for Chicago-style deep dish pizza in what amounts to a franchised gastropub. Of course, there's a full menu to accommodate everyone's tastes, but beer and pizza serve as the backbone. The aesthetic is reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory-style opulence, featuring dark woods, high ceilings, and a large bar with backlit liquor bottles. Kitschy memorabilia are here forgone in favor of a large corporate mural of nondescript yeoman farmers growing wheat and making beer. The bar has a massive four-picture television, and smaller screens are tastefully interspersed throughout the rest of the restaurant. We enjoyed the starter Caesar (creamy with a slight zip), the spicy sausage deep dish (the heat builds nicely), and their 'Pizookie,' which is a rather hokey name for a miniature hot cookie pie topped with ice cream. We used a Google Offer, but I'm a little annoyed that they didn't suggest the 'Party for Two' special, featured on their website, which would have come out even better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=80
Tony N.,"Waco, TX",10,10,,5.0,8/18/2013,Great and fast service! Appetizers are great! Recommend trying the avocado rolls. There are so many entrees that I'm not sure where to begin.

Beverly B.,"Waco, TX",0,7,2,1.0,12/27/2014,Hostess sat us at dirty table. We had to ask for it to be cleaned. Ordered appetizer. Asked for plates to eat it with when it came out. The plates were dirty with someone else's food all over the bottom of two of them.  Waiter rolled his eyes at us for asking for clean plates. Did not apologize or try to make experience better. My food came out wrong. Asked for no onions meal had onions on it. My husbands food also came out wrong  he ordered salmon got chicken  our friend ordered steak medium. It came out well done. All in all terrible experience. To make it worse our waiter did not care or even try to make anything better. In fact he made experience worse by terrible attitude.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=80

I go with my family foster trips to the mall for the appetizer sampler and the parmesan encrusted chicken served with broccoli and cream potatoes yum yum!!! The cream and black cherry sodas are always good and made in the building I also like how even with a wait you can usually get bar seating with the big TV split into 4 screens this would be a great place to take your homecoming date,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=100
Jeff T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,15,14,1.0,9/16/2012,"I have been to BJ's back at home in houston, tx. The deep dish pizzas were actual deep dish pizzas like the one on the photo on their home page.  well the deep dish pizzas we received at this BJ's looked like a take out pizza that came from pizza hut. It tasted like COLD oily cardboard with no sauce.  the waiter did not even offer the option of steak fries for fish and chips. Instead they decided to serve a classic English dish with skinny fries that were cold.  We asked for the manager and I addressed the issues about how the pizzas are not the same as the other BJ's I have been to. He told me ""this is how they are supposed to be made and they were always like this."" After I told him I just went to the BJ's at home 1 month ago, he tells me ""we changed that 1 month ago.""  What did not make sense to me was the manager told me that they cook their deep dish pizzas in the original deep dish containers, but they transfer the pizza to a plate because it ""keeps it warmer.""  I went onto the website for BJ's to find the corporate contact information, and the front page photo was a picture of a waiter holding a deep dish pizza by a clamp just as I described it to the manager.  My total dining time was 2 hours.  This place is not the same as other BJ's. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE. THIS PLACE IS OVER PRICED CONSIDERING THEY ARE NOT UP TO PAR WITH OTHER BJ'S.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=100
Michelle R.,"Waco, TX",0,11,,5.0,6/18/2012,"My husband and I went to BJ'S on Saturday after opening.  It was terribly crowded, but once we got in, the service was great.  Even though our food was late, our waiter took it upon himself to check on the food 2 times, obviously since they'd been open less than a week, there were the opening problems and having such large crowds.  So, we understand.  The tables were smaller than usual, so I guess they could fit more people in. Now, the food and drink.  I had the B.J.'s P.M. Porter, and it was the best dark beer I've ever had, smooth and rich, and went perfectly with my food.  My husband had the Nutty Brewnette which was good, but more bitter than I like in a dark beer. Spinach-stuffed mushrooms, they needed to bring out a smaller serving dish as it made the mushrooms look even smaller.  But they were delicious. I ordered the knife and fork sandwich,  ""Piranha, Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger.  The beef tasted of the highest grade, and my medium-well grill was perfect.  The chili was also very tasty.  I would order this again. My husband had the chicken fried steak, he said it was better than anything he's had in Waco, and I sampled the gravy, and although they didn't bring enough for a chicken fried steak, it was really good, and if it was a mix, they disguised it well, because it tasted homemade. All in all a good experience, more expensive than the usual places we visit, but worth it to save to go here.  I think the noise and the longer wait for food with get better with time.  I hope the food stays as good as it is!  So for now, 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=100
Kendall G.,"Waco, TX",7,22,1,1.0,12/26/2013,"I wish I could give this restaurant 0 stars. I rarely complain or go somewhere that I am just disgusted by, but this place was that kind of experience. At our table we ordered an appetizer sampler (which we never received, but were charged for until my husband corrected the server) a steak, a burger, chicken Alfredo and the cheeseburger pizza. Both the Alfredo and the steak were ice cold, as were the sides with the steak. My pizza was in edible. The sauce had the taste and consistency of ketchup. It took 30 mins for us to get our drinks, even though we were sitting in the bar and just ordered beers. Only our friends burger was even edible, and even it wasn't anything special. We will probably never go back to this location after our first disastrous visit. I've dined at others, including the ones in temple and round rock and they were great but combining poor, slow service with cold and unappetizing food and you have a recipe for restaurant failure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-waco?start=100
