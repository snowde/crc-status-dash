Kristen A.,"Boston, MA",0,47,10,4.0,12/18/2017,"Had a superior visit to BJ's this time! The food menu has been expanded to include some clever and tasty dishes that appeal to all diners, including vegetarian and gluten-free folks. Lucky to snag two seats at the bar, we each got a beer flight and a snack. We both loved the in-house Pale Ale, I think it was called Piranha, and the Green Flash West Coast Double IPA. Snack #1 was so good I am going to try to duplicate it at home - the Turmeric-Roasted Cauliflower, which was wonderfully spiced not just with turmeric but also cumin, paprika, and some chili powder. It came with perfectly cooked red lentils and crunchy roasted slivered almonds. Just awesome! My friend reported that Snack #2 was excellent - the Couscous Mac'n'Cheese. (It's gluten-free, but she isn't, she just thought it sounded great.) It comes with bacon, tomatoes, and lots of cheese, and it vanished as quickly as my cauliflower. The service is super-friendly and professional. I love the atmosphere. I don't know about table service, as the bar is the place to hang IMO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach

Joe B.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,1,,2.0,12/28/2017,"Went to BJs this evening Thursday Dec 28,2017 My wife read off the menu and asked for a Bacon cheeseburger for under $10.00 was told that Item was no longer available.  We both ordered a Blond beer , was also told that they were out of blond. I ordered fish and chips and asked for cocktail sauce for the fish and was told they didn't have any. That's three items they did not have in one sitting. If the items in question weren't available why were they not removed from the menu. Or told so right off. Afraid there's many more better places  to dine without all the negatives.

Quintella J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",144,87,204,4.0,12/8/2017,"BJ's restaurant was pretty darn good and they offer daily specials which we greatly appreciate.  I got a great five dollar cocktail. our waiter name was Omar he was not only handsome but he was a great waiter he was very prompt, friendly and made great recommendations we had the deep dish pepperoni pizza can I tell you all type of amazing it was so good!!! I would highly recommend the pizza and we also ordered the Sriracha queso of which was absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant for any party size, age and food desire because the menu options are endless and the atmosphere is bar/dine in with a laid back but nice feel and not to mention the location couldn't be better ( its right next to the Palm Beach Outlet.

Rabia J.,"Boynton Beach, FL",2697,672,2144,3.0,11/11/2016,"One word to describe BJ's is that it is ""decent."" Nothing special yet nothing horrible either.  They seemed a bit over whelmed on election night with the sitting.  Surprisingly we found bar seating with the high top tables near the tv. Our server seemed crazy busy but took our order promptly when we said we were ready.  After ordering and getting the food he didn't come to check if we needed anything. we only flagged him down when we needed the check to pay for our meal at the end.  My friend and I only got appetizer and desserts since I had eaten a late lunch and was not hungry.  Their guacamole and chips was mediocre but had a good kick to it.  Their dessert did not disappoint , many dessert options in their menu.  I would recommend getting the trio of the pizooki desserts. They are known for their pizooki dessert and if you have never eaten it before it is a cookie almost like a pizza cookie.  They bake it, I'm assuming in a tin baking circular plate.  They have many flavors but we got chocolate, salted Carmel, cookies and cream.  Our favorite was chocolate.  All three came with a scoop of ice cream which tasted really good.   Overall I would try them again but to eat main course and dessert.  And maybe not sit in the bar area to get good service.~",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach

I would love to show you a picture of my quinoa bowl with blackened chicken that ordered on Wed. night, unfortunately the quinoa was missing (replaced by cold brown rice) and my chicken was grilled. Turns out my dinner companion got my blackened chicken. Looked and asked for our waitress, she came 15-20 later, asking, ""how's it going, everything good?""  I said no, told her my little tale of woe, she followed up by asking if we wanted dessert. No Thanks! She brought the bill, she's discounted my dish by $7.95.

Steve B.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,8,3,3.0,7/25/2017,"I eat and drink her often. Generally the food is terrific. Tonight was a horrible exception. Three weeks ago I had stopped in for dinner. I had been eyeing their chicken parmesan with broccoli. Evidently I was not the only one. They ran out. Now I really wanted it. So a week later I go back. But now the boneless chicken wings caught my eye. After several rounds of eenie, meenie, minee mo  I ordered the wings. So tonight finally the chicken parmesan and some nice broccoli.  My goodness it was terrible. When the expediter brought it out I couldn't wait. But even before it was in front of me the bartender had noticed the wilted olive drab broccoli and he ordered a side for me. But alas the chicken was way overdone and dry. The parmesan was DARK brown not the light golden depicted. The chicken looked like it had been pressed and it had been cooked until dry and chewy. The meal comes with two sizeable pieces. I ate little more than half of one. I had to make a  serious effort with my knife. I had expected to cut it with my fork. And I believe if cooked properly I could have. I am adding a picture. Note the original broccoli as compared to the piece from the side. The really sad part about this besides my disappointment was that this excuse for dinner should have been intercepted by the cook, can't call this guy a chef,  or by the expediter. I applaud the bartender for trying to make things good.  I had two drinks. One while waiting and the other with dinner. My bill was $58.00 plus tip. Come on folks you can do better. I know I have seen it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach
Jesse P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,1,1,5.0,12/2/2017,Once again this place never ceases to amaze me. Food was quick coming out and spot on in taste. 1 pound of wings for the price is a steal when they taste is as good as the picture.

Trinity M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",61,29,39,4.0,8/28/2017,It was really good. We got the mini pizzas during the happy hour and then the Pizookie Trio. We got the pizzas half off since it was happy hour and originally it would've been $12 which is kind of crazy because it was a mini pizza which shouldn't even be more than $5. But they were good. No better than a deep dish pizza from Pizza Hut. Our waitress was really nice and very low key but not the forget about you low key. We got to enjoy each other without being interrupted.  It was a typical chain restaurant but the food was still good. And the Pizookies were REALLY good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach

I'm writing this review kinda late, so don't remember the exact wordings of the menu items. But we had the Wisconsin cheese bites for an appetizer, it was decent.

Nee Nee E.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,6,,1.0,10/21/2017,"Spent $50 for lunch for 2 people and all we got was 2 beers, a grilled ham & cheese sandwich with 1 thin slice of ham that looked like it was off the under 12 kiddie menu and an insultingly small burger with about 10 French fries. In addition, the service was awful. Our drink glasses were left empty for at lease 15 minutes and our server never came and asked, ""How is everything?"" so we were left with an empty catsup bottle on the table and no catsup and dry glasses. So sad, since we live less than 10 minutes from here, but I think all they are concerned with are tourists coming off I95, not caring if they ever come back again.

Ronaldo G.,"Jupiter, FL",309,32,270,4.0,3/14/2017,BJ's is one of the best new chain restaurant/brewpubs to come along on recent years.   It's beautifully designed and reminds me of the early days of Cheesecake Factory. Everything we have been served has been tasty and well executed.  Of special note is their Poke appetizer.   Awesome.   They take their beer seriously and offer alot of ways to sample them.  From free tasters to flights (multiple mini glasses of their brews)... very impressive.  The only reason why they didn't get 5 stars....service.   They are still working out staffing kinks..but I'm definitely going back for more!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=20
Steve S.,"Parsippany, NJ",562,1173,285,4.0,12/15/2016,"My daughter and I stopped into this place on a very recent trip to Florida...not even realizing it was the chain until after we sat down (we've been to the one in Towson, MD a number of times).  This location is really set up nicely with high open ceilings, lots of TVs, and a lot of space.   We were seated quickly and asked for drink orders - they didn't have the craft beer I wanted so I ordered the BJs Nut Brown Ale (not my favorite ever, but a very solid beer).  My daughter was starving (after three days of field hockey) so we started with an appetizer of Margherita Fresca flatbread which was phenomenal - I'm becoming a bigger fan of these flatbread appetizers.  We also both ordered Caesar salads which were your standard, but nice - crisp lettuce, crunchy croutons and not too much dressing. For our meals my daughter ordered Chicken fingers and fries (wedge/steak fries) and I ordered the Fried jalapeño burger and fries (thin fries).  It's pretty hard to screw up chicken fingers and they certainly didn't here at BJs...my daughter loved them and the fries nice sized portions of both.  My burger, which I ordered medium came out well done, but was still tasty...and juicy actually.  It's a pretty big burger, especially after a salad and appetizer, so I actually didn't finish it...well, to be honest I needed to leave room because my daughter was 100% going to order the trio Pizzookie's!   If you've never had a Pizzookie you need to give it a shot.  Cookies cooked in a small deep dish pizza tray and topped with ice cream...SO good...and I'm sure they are good FOR you as well!  We ordered the Salted Caramel, the Triple Chocolate with Ghiardelli and the Chocolate Chunk.  I may have left some of my burger on the table...but my dogs wouldn't have been able to lick this dessert tray any cleaner. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is it drives me nuts when you have a beer menu and you don't update it when you no longer have the beer...or AT LEAST let the wait staff know what isn't available on a given night.  Additionally, while our service was fairly quick, our waitress never came back to check on us or refresh our waters or ask if I wanted another beer until 10 minutes after we were done eating our entrees...and then it took another 15 minutes after we finished dessert to get the check.  So the service was a little mixed...otherwise the meal was great and I would MUCH rather go to a BJs than one of the local chain places up in Northern NJ.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=20

Joe H.,"Boynton Beach, FL",331,96,182,5.0,3/28/2017,"BJ's is my favorite Brewhouse in the West Palm Beach area. They have ample parking outside so you have no problem finding a spot when you arrive. The dining area choices are perfect as they have a good sized dining room area and they have a large bar with lots of high tops available so you can have some beer and watch the game. Speaking of the game, BJ's has a LOT of TV's for the sports enthusiast. Behind the middle of their bar (up high) they feature a block of 4 large HD TV's with different games on each TV. There are a few more tv's on that wall and tv's throughout.  Onto the beer. BJ's has their own beer selection from their brewery (the WPB location's beers are brewed in Texas) and has a great menu describing them in great detail. They also have a great craft beer selection to go along with their offerings so there is something for any beer lover. The food selection is what is really impressive at BJ's. They have a section of their menu called ""Enlightened Favorites"" and they list the calorie content of the dishes for all of these selections. This section of their menu in beyond impressive with bison burgers, turkey burgers, vegetarian tacos, barbacoa cauliflower tacos, peanut chicken with soba noodles, salmon tacos, quinoa bowls, and many salads including a seared ahi tuna salad. Having such an amazing selection of healthier fare truly sets BJ's apart from the competition.  I got the Barbeque Bison Burger which comes with lean, ground buffalo, boldly seasoned then grilled to order. Topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, seared green chilies and pico de gallo and served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce. It is served with tangy slaw tossed with Baja vinaigrette and topped with green onions. The flavor is literally bursting from each bite.  Bj's also has a rewards program that I signed up for while there and an accompanying app. You get a free Pizookie (baked cookie dessert) for signing up and 1 point for every dollar you spend. You get $5 off for every 75 points you accumulate.  On a scale of 1-10 for Brewhouse's I give them a solid 10. Their beer selection is awesome and their food offerings are unparalleled. If you are in the area I would definitely give them a try you wont be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=20

We were seated on the small patio (not heavily used) but my wife likes to eat in the fresh air. We were seated right away and our orders taken. Food was served promptly (and was good) but that was the last time I saw our server. Poof. Gone. I had planned on ordering another drink but after waiting 15 mins we decided to just get our check and leave. Another 5 mins... no server. We when to the hostess stand in the front to try to pay but our hostess was taking an order from a table four 4, but the amount of time spent was more like a table of Twenty. Another 8 mins and we finally got our check.  I asked to speak to the manager. He listen, but honestly his response was ""I really don't care.""  An amazing 180 degree change from the management a couple years ago.  If service matters, let this be a warning.

The handcrafted sodas are perfect. Typically I get the root beer or creme soda.  I've had many dishes here. My favorite is the deep dish pepperoni pizza. Outside of Chicago, especially for a chain, the deep dish is perfectly equal parts crust, cheese, sauce, and pepperoni. The buffalo chicken deep dish is a bit sweet for my taste.  Pazookie desserts are to die for, literally. Any flavor, and combo, just go for it.

The place is very clean and staff very friendly. Nice variety on the menu. We ordered Bloody Mary's that came with wilted celery. Yes wilted! I couldn't believe they served it looking like this with the leaves all hanging down. The meal was very good but we had to ask to have dirty dishes taken away so we could fit our entree on the table. As I watched I noticed that the food runner, waitress and even the manager have a habit of walking back to the kitchen empty handed each and every time. Ordered another round of Bloody Mary's and this time we got the wilted celery with nothing else. No olive, no green bean, no pepper. Very disappointing experience to say the least.

We ordered Crispy Jalapeño Burger and a personal size BJ's Favorie pizza (meatballs, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, olives, white onions & seasoned tomatoes). Burger was great and came w/ well seasoned steak fries. Medium burger had nice spicy crunch from the fried breaded jalapenos!  The pizza was also piping hot & tasty.

It's a big, noisy place, but that's what it's supposed to be.The menu is quite large, but not all the pages are bound in the same order.  Was it going to be one of the interesting burgers or a pizza.  Well, since this place started as BJ's Pizza before it changed its name and menu, I opted for a personal pizza.  A caveat, as a New Yorker, I'm biased toward NYC style pizza. I was surprised by my BJ's Classic Combo with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom. About the size of a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza, this is vastly better. The dough, unlike most Chicago-style pizza (BJ's model), was buttery and yeasty (my daughter said it still reminded her of Pizza Hut but less salty, however). There wasn't a ton of cheese and the toppings were flavorful. The craft beer selection is wide and a sampler of four 5 oz pours was just $6. The Hefeweizen was spot on with loads of banana and bubble gum eatery notes and the Jeremiah Red Ale was a nicely balanced, drinkable brew. Less-liked, but still okay, were BJ's PM Porter, which was easy to drink, but nothing too special, and Nutty Brunette, which had a husky, grainy character.

Mauro R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",53,183,26,2.0,1/17/2016,"Two visits here and same feeling: service is hit and miss even at the bar. Food is okay a slightly overpriced for the quality. In short it's a place that gives me no reason to go back, although I might stop for a beer if in the area. But there are many better options around.  I have to say the area around the new Palm Beach Outlets is pretty lacking in terms of restaurants; quantity is there, but quality not so much.

Allison N.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",252,695,596,4.0,9/28/2014,"I actually quite enjoyed the food I had at BJ's which was sort of surprising because I wasn't expecting a lot. My family and I decided to come here for lunch before I left town and the place was PACKED. I mean, I have quite honestly never seen this many people in one restaurant in West Palm Beach at the same time, except maybe the Cheesecake Factory. But even with a full house, we were still able to get a table speedily, which was great. We started with the potstickers and the stuffed mushrooms. The stuffed mushrooms were much better than the potstickers. Now, I'm not totally sure what was in those mushrooms except it was some sort of cheesy deliciousness that was slightly breaded. They were topped with this creamy green sauce which was pretty tasty as well.  The potstickers were okay, nothing too snazzy.  My dad and I split two entrees -- the scallops and the lemon thyme chicken. I quite enjoyed the lemon thyme chicken since it had a GREAT flavor and the brussel sprouts that came with it were really good and not overcooked. The scallops were also pretty tasty and not too fishy. Service was decent. Our waiter brought me out another soda before I had even finished half of my drink which was sort of weird since my water remained unfilled for the entire rest of the meal. Strange, but nothing too out of control. I'd come back for that lemon thyme chicken. Mmm, mmm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=80

Deb M.,"Jupiter, FL",29,21,34,4.0,1/17/2015,"Tried this place bc it is right by the outlet mall and I needed sustenance before beginning the shopping expedition today. I wanted to order a few diff meals on the menu but since I knew I'd be shopping I just ordered an appetizer and dessert. I can't bear the thought of throwing away half my meal (I never finish a meal bc portion sizes are ridiculous in the US of A) instead of taking it home for leftovers...and nothing would be good after sitting in my car for hours as I shopped.  So, I tried the Fritto nachos...I Love Frittos and I love nachos so this sounded like a match made in heaven. I was impressed with the presentation of both the appetizer and dessert. They came out looking EXACTLY like the pic in the menu. That really doesn't happen very often.  The nachos were delish. Still crunchy even though they were underneath a lot of wet, gooey, yummy stuff..cheese, chili, sour cream. It felt really odd eating nachos with a fork, but bc Frittos are so much smaller than regular nacho chips eating with fingers isn't an option...okay it's an option but a really, really messy one.  The baked beignet was yummy too...and picture perfect. Not like a beignet from Nola but still very good. The strawberries were fresh and the whipped cream too. I love strawberry shortcake so a pet peeve is ordering it and tasting that, these have been sitting in the juice too long, flavor that happens more often than not when eating out. Don't know why it seems to happen a lot but it does. Not here though, and the whipped cream was real, definitely not Ready Whip.  The waitress (Kristen K) was pleasant and efficient. Another pet peeve is seeing the attitude change in the server when they realize the check is gonna be a small one. So whenever I have a good server and I have a small check I always tip on what the cost of a full meal would be..usually the price of what my hubby and I would spend on lunch or dinner. I'm sweet like that :-)  The only negative I would say is that the hostess was cleaning the door when I got there and told me she'd be right with me...and finished cleaning the door as I stood at the hostess stand waiting. When a customer comes in that should be the priority, the door will be there after the customer is seated. She was not friendly and didn't smile either. That has got to be my biggest pet peeve of all in regard to dining out. Hostesses are supposed to make the customer feel welcome and smile, and say more than ""One?"" when greeting a customer.  But overall a very good experience at this restaurant...if you like good ""bad"" food, like nachos and strawberry shortcake beignets definitely give it a go. I'll be back on a night I can take my leftovers home...quite a few yummy looking meals on the menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=80

Only $8 for the sandwich, fries plus my choice of soup or salad. I couldn't beat that at a drive through! It was made with a nice piece of carved chicken breast (NOT lunch meat) which was a plus for me. Very delicious! I was on lunch break for work and they got my meal out right away. I was only disappointed with my cold clam chowder soup. They probably prepare ahead of time but they're not keeping it warm enough.

William L.,"Frankfort, KY",0,2,,2.0,2/6/2017,"This is the second Brewhouse I have visited in the last week. As other reviews have noted, it isn't unique and each restaurant is virtually identical based on my limited experience.  There is a good selection of beer but nothing special to separate it from many other chain restaurants. The food was average at best. The salmon was overcooked and the pizza was soft and chewy. (Not bad if you like it that way). We were there in the early evening and the rooms were filled with TVs but few people. Since we couldn't avoid watching we asked to change a channel on one TV to a non-Fox news station since they were reporting exclusively and repetitively on the many incidents demonstrating how unfairly President Trump is being portrayed including a story on national news about a grade school boy who was bullied for wearing a Trump ball cap. ( who would have thought grade school bullies are politically motivated? ) Regardless,  the restaurant manager refused the request to provide any alternative to Fox news.

Service was great each time and although they forgot my order on the second visit they made up for it and that's all most customers are looking for. Mistakes happen but if management takes the time to address the issue and make sure you are satisfied then what's to complain about. I've been to other BJ's so the menu was not new to me. I'd say you can't go wrong with the burgers and the pizza is awesome! Even the small can feed a crowd! The spinach dip is so so... it's more cheesy then creamy and needs a tad more spinach in my opinion. The avocado egg rolls are really tasty and I love that they cut them small so it's perfect to share with a group.  Pizookie!!!! Get the trio, you can thank me later :) Fresh baked warm cookie with vanilla ice cream. You will not want to share. The salted caramel is divine and the double chocolate is so sinfully delicious! I want one now. Not only do they have a great selection of their own beers and many more but their cocktail menu is very impressive. I've tried a bunch of their own beers but the Tatonka Stout is by far my favorite. Dark, rich and thick. Pure heaven! I highly suggest calling a head and putting your name on the wait list before you arrive. Since it's located by the new Outlets it tends to be really busy and the bar seems to be a very popular hangout.

When the cold, bland soup came, the spoon had the last diner's left over broccoli on it and it took 10 mins for me to receive a replacement.   If the service was lax the food certainly was no redeeming quality.The pizza we ordered was absolutely terrible.  I was sauce-less (but supposedly a deep dish???) and tasted like it was microwavable.  Digiorno is gourmet in comparison.  The soup tasted like some gravy substance and promptly gave me indigestion (and i've a cast-iron stomach).

The mix of cheeses that were on top of the pasta and meats were divine, and the seasoning on the meats were just right. I loved the fact that the cheese on top was baked and nicely broiled to add a few touches of crispiness to the cheese. I literally ate the entire meal with no leftovers to spare. The customer service was top notch which was very surprising considering the fact that we had a party of 18, and the manager came over several times to make sure our meal was going great.

Another waitress brought out my order and didn't even acknowledge me. I asked if that was the cheese & tomato pizza and she just nodded and gave it to me.

This is not an exaggeration, it took almost an hour for 2 pizookies, and that was after waiting more than 30 min to even order. We were last to leave so another server tried to saddle us with other ppl food. We were told there were 2 items (totaling $21) were not on because someone else paid for them.

My fiend asked of martinis were on happy hour special. NOPE! So she ordered a lemon drop martini anyway. Not sure where the bartender learned to make it but if was horrible.  Bitter. Not sweet at all.  I should mention that I ordered a beer from their tap selection. I waited 10 mins for a beer.  Martinis was sent back as it was i drinkable.

For an appetizer we ordered the California Club Flatbread and it was just 'ok'. For a main dish I ordered the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne, which was pretty good except it only had 3 tiny shrimp in it. Then my mom ordered the Santa Fe Salad and added blackened shrimp. This is where everything started to turn south. Her 'blackened' shrimp were not blackened, instead they simply threw blackened seasoning all over her salad. Also the shrimp were SO over cooked that you could not eat them. After this mishap we decided to order a Salted Caramel Pizookie. When it came out and we were given the spoons to eat, 2 of the 3 spoons had food on them. I was floored by how unsanitary the utensils were.

James I.,"West Palm Beach, FL",46,67,3,1.0,5/29/2014,"We had a pretty bad experience at this location last week, which was unfortunate since we enjoy BJ's and were excited to have them opening in West Palm Beach.  I don't know if it was because it was their first/second week or whatever, but the service was an absolute mess. We were there for over two hours for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. We never dealt with our initial waitress. Many different people brought us food, got our refills, asked us if we needed anything, etc. The same meal we'd already received was brought to the table two or three times. Also, I ordered a buffalo burger - it was cooked well when I initially bit into it, but it was pretty much rare after that. It took forever to get a new one made, so I got to eat my food alone after everyone had been finished for a while. The manager came over to talk to us after all this and offered our party free desserts, but those took 20 minutes just to get to the table.  It definitely wasn't the experience I was hoping for. We'll give them another a shot, but it likely won't be for a while. I sure hope they improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=120

But I do want to give some feedback.  While the atmosphere at BJ's is good for groups or to watch sporting events I have had more bad experiences than good.  The food is average at best. The best meal I had were the lemon pepper dry rub wings. The flavor was decent and they were cooked well. Prior to that, I tried the chicken gyros and that was very dry plus and the chicken was overcooked. I only went back out of sheer circumstance.  Lastly, the service. This was the real downfall. The service was as bad as it could possibly be. From the server not showing up to the table until we had been there for 15 minutes, to an order being wrong - and then when we were ready to go it took an act of God to get the check. Not enjoyable at all. The kicker is that we had the same server both times so my woes were consistent.

ElizaBeth W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",56,132,29,4.0,5/20/2014,"We had the opportunity to eat at BJ's before they actually opened to the public. The location is very convenient - right off 95 and next to the new Palm Beach Outlets.  We had a reservation, so we were seated right away, but they do have a pretty large waiting area if you were to come when it was busy and without a reservation.  All of the staff was very friendly and accommodating - many members of the waitstaff stopped by our table to see how we were enjoying our experience and our meal. Our 9 month old twins were with us, which was another reason so many staff members stopped by. People can't help themselves when they see cute babies! Our meals were good! I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and I would definitely order it again! My husband had a bbq chicken pizza and he said it was good. We sampled a couple of BJ's beers. I had the Oasis Amber and my husband had the Goliath - both tasty beers! We didn't have time to try their famous Pizookie for dessert, but I definitely look forward to trying it when we return.  It's definitely worth mentioning that they have a free rewards program that you can sign up for before eating there at  . After signing up, I immediately got an email for a free Pizookie! Basically, with their rewards program, you earn 1 point for every dollar spent and you start earning rewards after you've spent $75. They also have convenient online ordering with options for dine in, take out, or curbside takeaway. The take out and curbside are pretty self-explanatory, but with their dine-in ordering you can place your order before you even arrive. They will go ahead and hold your spot on their wait list and then when you are seated the kitchen will immediately being preparing your meal. After the meal, you can even pay with your smartphone if you want. Pretty cool!

Margie D.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,86,12,4.0,11/29/2014,"My first time eating at this restaurant was in Gainesville, FL and enjoyed the meals and service every time.  The first time we tried this location was a disaster.  Not sure if it was server's or cooks problem (newly opened).  Manager tried to make good but I ended up leaving hungry.  Went back a month later with family and service and food was good.  I love their meals so I will go back again.  I am giving 4 stars based on my Gainesville experience and hope WPB will live up to their reputation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=160
Lara R.,"Miami, FL",20,181,54,2.0,6/10/2014,"Food was just meh. The burger fell apart and the shrimp lettuce wraps didn't seem fresh and the lettuce was soggy.

Trina S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",257,109,61,3.0,7/23/2014,The service was decent. The staff was very nice. So that was a plus. But quite honestly the pizza tasted a lot like Pizza Hut. Nothing special. Our wait time was short. So no complaints. So if I do come back I may try a mixed drink & some appetizers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=160
Lydia C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,25,,3.0,2/6/2016,"As as a rare time the family can be together, of all ages, we are seated quicker than had been anticipated in a nice size booth for all the members.  Our server comes quickly for our drink order and that is where quick stops.  We do all get our orders for food placed then we wait and wait more.  This was mid-afternoon and the restaurant wasn't crowded at the time.  When the food arrives 35-45 minutes later with most of the table close to a meltdown at this point, our order comes out incorrect.  My husband gets a dish he isn't happy with since it is not what he ordered. Our server is not around at this point and our drinks show it, by the way.  So we make due with the food given to us.  Then servers show up with the actual order placed... Server apologizes for the mix-up once she arrives to give us our check.  No offer to check the price difference of the menu items, just ""I can't do anything now"". We paid , tipped as proper 20% and left, fed but not really happy with the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=160

Kristina D.,"Hyannis, MA",0,18,,5.0,1/22/2016,"AMAZING! My boyfriend and I stopped in here to escape the rain and grab something quick to eat. He always jokes if you see cops eating somewhere it must be a great place and there was a table of police officers seated in the middle of the dining room enjoying their lunch. We were seated immediately and the place was pretty busy (we were there around noon). Our waiter came over very soon after we sat down and he was incredible! Joel was quick, charming, and very helpful when we asked for suggestions. I got the Clementine Crush drink it was so refreshing. We decided to get two apps to share, first the Sriracha Brussels sprouts they were wonderful. Big enough portion to share but not big enough to overwhelm.. They were seasoned perfectly and Joel even brought us extra Sriracha crema for dipping.. Do yourself a favor and try these you won't regret it. Next we wanted wings but couldn't decide between the lemon pepper or the garlic Parmesan so Joel told us he would just get us a split order and I'm so happy he did. Both flavors were phenomenal! Perfect balance of spices, so delicious! The rest of the menu looked amazing and I wish I was hungrier to try something else!! They looked like they have the perfect blend of tasty and healthy. I would definitely recommend this place and next time I'm in the area I will be stopping by!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=160
Mike S.,"Jupiter, FL",18,84,61,2.0,5/31/2014,"Really horrible experience that I'll chalk up to opening month jitters and poor hiring choices.

On a not so crowded night, it took 15 minutes for waiter to acknowledge us, another half hour to bring out drinks, and an hour to bring out food. The food was dry and my steak was overkooked. Once the waiter took it back, I waited over half hour to get it. No apology, no manager came out, and I was billed the full amount. They even added second steak to it, before the waiter realized it and changed the check. Would not recommend...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=180
Adrian H.,"Shrewsbury, MA",0,19,174,1.0,4/25/2015,"I gave it one star as zero wasn't an option. I never complain and always see the glass half full - this place was awful. Our pizza was delivered very carefully using tongues on the pizza tray. We both tried a piece, looked at each other and then I lifted the tray with my hands as it was cold. I asked the server if it could be warmed and she replied yes, not oh very sorry yes, just yes. The pizza was returned nice and hot and, oh yes, without the pizza slice, so we served ourselves with our hands. The table had no silverware so we next requested this. Half way through the pizza we were asked if we wanted a dessert; we politely explained we hadn't finished the pizza. Two minutes later we were offered 2 burgers and we explained that it was probably for a different table. Beer selection here is great. Service and food  are definitely not. Burger and pizza are the easiest of food options and checking they are warm not difficult.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-west-palm-beach?start=180
Maureen M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,4,,1.0,2/19/2015,"I tried this place a couple of times and each time was exactly the same. First time I figured it was because they were new but I guess not. We ordered two sandwiches and two sodas, 1 1/2 hours later, we got our cold (should have been hot) sandwiches. The next time, same thing, another 1 1/2 hours but this time we just cancelled the sandwiches. The last time, another 1/2 hours and we got more cold (should have been hot) sandwiches.

I settled on a steak and found that it was over seasoned and way too peppery. Mashed potatoes were great. My salad came out after my main dish, and it was warm. I really enjoyed their hand crafted root beer, but it was super sweet.
