Kevin P.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",566,865,156,3.0,4/28/2016,"It's a great place for lunch or an early dinner before you catch a movie- it gets SUPER busy though, but it's worth calling about 30 minutes ahead to save a table. Their menu changes frequently, but as long as their pizza stays the same I'll be happy! They have decent mixed drinks, the service is really good here, and it doesn't take too long to get food, but as expected the busier it is the slower the food comes. Their lunch special is really good and reasonably priced - $8 for a personal 1 topping pizza and a wedge? Sounds good to me because the combo is filling and tastes great :D I probably come here once a month and never think twice about coming.

Bruce H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,69,,5.0,6/24/2017,"While I know BJ's is a pizza joint their prime rib dinner is delicious. It comes with nice salad, two sides and their famous dessert. While it is always hard to go to a pizza place and not get pizza they have found something with the prime rib. Also, gentleman who greeted us was very friendly as was waiter. I had been here a year or two back and it was very disappointing kudos to management for turning this place around!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=40
Luke L.,"San Gabriel, CA",21,1281,8757,2.0,2/22/2015,"*Difficult parking (Broxton Avenue Public Parking is your best bet - $3 flat rate after 6 PM) *Pricey food (believe it or not, but healthier salads like BJ's Enlightened Entrees are actually more expensive than BJ's Specialty Salads - I am basically paying more for healthier food -_-) *Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad With Grilled Chicken Breast (Baby kale, herb-roasted brussels sprouts, romaine, blueberries, red grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, candied pecans, toasted pepitas and red onions tossed in strawberry vinaigrette. $12.95): I wasn't impressed - tasted pretty stale and overshadowed by strawberry vinaigrette dressing.

Megan J.,"Riverside, CA",39,221,529,3.0,6/9/2015,"I have come to this BJ's many times and I came here yesterday for the first time in awhile. BJ's is A-OK.  Food: As a beverage I normally get their house brewed root beer and I enjoy this. For a meal, I usually get a small deep dish cheese and pepperoni pizza. I do like their pizzas. They're pretty good, but can be pretty greasy sometimes. Occasionally I will get a pizookie and I LOVE them. They are so good.  Service: The service is usually pretty good. It is sometimes lacking, but generally our server is on top of it enough so that we have a pleasant experience. Our server yesterday was good. He took my husband's allergy to onions and garlic seriously. He refilled drinks when they were low. He manicured unwanted or items that were finished off of the table. He was very good.  Ambiance: BJ's is a very chill environment that you can relax in. It is a great place to come to if you're with a group, want to get a couple beers, food and hang out to watch a game or something.  BJ's isn't necessarily my first choice of restaurants that I would go to, but it is usually pretty good and does the trick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=40
Sandra S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,38,,1.0,11/9/2016,"Such a horrible experience, I'm a big fan of Bj's restaurant in general, I went to this location with my friends for the first/last time after we voted yesterday, I hated it and I have a reasons for that. 1.The restaurant is very ugly and disgusting 2. The restaurant was full (over 60 people) and just 2 waitress 3. They served our dinner before appetizers which I never seen that in my whole life 4. My drink glass was empty for 20 min and the waitress just passed by ignoring that 5. I ordered clam chowder soup and I got something very deep and super salty which doesn't look like the soup at all. 6.Ladies room was very dirty and smelly and they didn't do anything about it when my friend mentioned 7.The waitress keep interrupting us with this paragraph (You need to move your cars if you park in the street, it's about towing) Stay away from this location, you will wasting your time and money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=40
Jordan S.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,9,1,2.0,11/27/2016,"I was very disappointed with this place. For starters, the service was bad. It took awhile for anyone to notice us sitting down when there were only like 6 other people in the restaurant.  The server was pretty out of it and served us our food before ever giving us silverware. The food itself was pretty underwhelming too. The soup/salad were very average and the pizza was flat out bad. You could tell the pan crust was pre-made and the toppings/cheese were pretty flavorless. It was Domino's quality at best, which is pretty terrible for a sit down place. I came for the 2 for $25 special so the prices weren't bad, but if you don't have any deals the place is pretty overpriced as well. I don't see myself ever coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=40
Angela G.,"Oxnard, CA",7,16,11,1.0,3/29/2017,"When I first started coming to this BJ's, 3 years ago, it was great, service and quality of food; however, the past few times that I have gone the flavor is lacking and the service is poor. When ordering fries, they are soggy and taste like old oil, the quinoa is basically raw in other dishes, and the rest have no seasoning and look as if it was just thrown together after being nuked in a microwave. As for the service, they are slow. I used to be able to eat there on my lunch break. I would also suggest not ordering to go or pick up, when I have I paid full price for the meal and end up getting less than what I would have dining in. By all means I'm not saying don't enjoy a meal by this chain, I'm just saying don't go to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=40

Justme G.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,38,1,1.0,5/16/2017,"First of all I had to give one star to give my review of this place. Second I would NEVER STEP FOOT IN THIS PLACE AGAIN. 5/15/2017 my daughter is a heart patient at UCLA RONALD REAGAN HOSPITAL. She has been in the hospital for 1-1/2 mos. and she was given a 2hr pass just to get out and feel the sun on her and to get a little relief, so we decided to take her to this so-called restaurant. When we arrived we were greeted by a non feeling type of a so called person by the name of Kimberly, now my daughter is in a wheelchair and we were told that there was no where to place the wheelchair, she could not find a place to put the wheelchair and she stated that if it's in the walk way it's afire hazard. Right after she finally seated us a couple came in with a double stroller that was as big as the wheelchair and was blocking the walkway and NOTHING WAS SAID TO THEM ABOUT IT BEING A FIRE HAZARD.  People with a disability is NOT WELCOMED AT BJ'S. We spent close to $200.00 for a party of 6. WE TOTALLY FELT DISCRIMINATION ON KIMBERLY's part total RACISM AT ITS BEST. They tried to cheat us on the check but we caught it. We were charged for a root beer float which no one ordered. We ordered one root beer soda and when the desert arrived we put some of the ice cream in the root beer soda and they tried their dampest to charge us for a float...TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. Before we left I had to let ""KIMBERLY"" know that she was wrong and that she will be reported then she tried her best to act like she didn't know what I was talking about. NO ONE FROM CORPORATE HAS CONTACTED US AS OF YET...BE WARNED IF YOU ARE BLACK BE CAREFUL",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=40

Carlos G.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,40,50,1.0,8/5/2016,"Wow. Where do I start?  I ended up at BJ's because my vehicle GPS directed me to a non existent Chili's restaurant. So after being turned away at a nearby closed California Pizza Kitchen, I decided to try BJ's. This place was busy and we were quickly seated. Only a three or four minute wait and our server arrived to take our drink order.  When our drinks arrived we ordered and we were off to a great start. We ordered flat bread nachos for an appetizer. My salad arrived in a timely manner. Then 15 min later our dinner. This is where everything went down hill. My baked potato was overcooked. It was brown on the inside. It had a smokey taste. I was confused. Was it supposed to be brown? Surely the cooks would not send this out like this. It was cut open by the cook. He would have seen it. The server confirmed it was burnt and she offered another side. I had already finished my steak. Which was also overcooked. I had to keep adding A-1 sauce to the steak to moisten it up so I could eat it. I didn't want to complain to the server because she was very busy and I didn't want my friends to feel uncomfortable about me complaining again. We finished up and asked for our check and then out of the blue our flat bread nachos arrived. Of course we turned them away and were told we wouldn't be charged for them. All I asked for was some kind of discount for the burnt  baked potato. The server said i could have a free desert in its place. So I ordered the three cookie ice cream plate. But after 15 long minutes it hadn't arrived. We asked for our check. 10 minutes later no check yet but our  ice cream did arrive.   I said I didn't want it anymore and I asked for my check again.  I just wanted to leave. I was tired of waiting. The server said she would give us the desert and take it off our check. (It was supposed to be free) On our check the appetizer read ""free"" which we never received and turned away and our desert was taken off the ticket. Wow. What a bad experience. I still did not get credit for my baked potato. My friends wanted to leave a small tip but I insisted on a 15% tip to the server. I usually leave 20% tips. I don't think she was to blame for the under staffing and the terrible cooks. She was really trying. I am sure other patrons left her little to no tips because of mismanagement here at this location. The funny thing is my friend ordered the exact steak I ordered and said it was the worst steak he had ever had at a restaurant. He didn't want to complain because he thought the server could use a break.  He saw another table sending their food back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=40
Jimmy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,9,2.0,3/15/2016,"Been living in Westwood for a while but first time to BJs. The online menu and the pricing wasn't attractive enough. And the first time here might be the last. I came here at Sunday 5:50pm looking for a table for two, but it was full and loud. Considering the noisy environment and needing to wait for 20+ minutes, we quickly decided to make it a takeout. What you see on the menu is sooo not what you get. I ordered a shrimp and asparagus penne and what I received was this small portion that can't even cover the bottom of the box. The taste of the shrimp was fine, but the penne tasted like can food while there is like only one asparagus and rough as bark. The only good thing is the box was the bread. That's it. I will avoid this place and make better use of my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=40
Miranda L.,"Tokyo, Japan",59,539,331,3.0,7/23/2015,"Okay location with a major service problem. The menu is somewhat limited compared to other BJ's locations in LA, so some choices you find elsewhere don't exist here. That being said, I still recommend the Deep Dish Pizza, French Dip, Buffalo Chicken Tenders, and of course the Pizookie. The issue here is with the service, which is regularly inconsistent. Normally the staff is just overworked and handling too many tables to give proper attention to you. But more than once (including my most recent visit) the server was just slow, and I watched my food linger under the heat lamp for far too long before it came to the table. Always fairly busy, usually with students. It can get very noisy too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=40

My waiter, Trevor, memorized all 12 of our customized and very specific orders and got them completely correct when the food came out. While the restaurant itself was a little bit packed, the service and the food overrided any negative about the place. I'm not sure if the same goes for other BJ's, but if you're in the Westwood area and on a budget with your friends I would definitely recommend this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=40

The manager a female, who was passing by asked if we wanted a box . I couldn't hear since there is a TV under us . Since she was far I asked her for a bill and a box .

Michelle T.,"Portland, ME",173,507,227,2.0,8/8/2014,"3-stars for the mahi mahi taco's I ordered, but 2-stars for just about everything else. The tortilla chips that came on the side. TERRIBLE. Stale, greasy, and according to my dining companions, ""smells and tastes like crayons.""  Hm. For $13, I think i could probably find something tastier elsewhere with a better bang for my buck, but BJ's was convenient, had no wait, and one of my friends LOVES this place.  Service was alright. Our waitress was prompt and nice enough, but you could tell she did NOT love her job. She just seemed real depressed. :( Poor girl.

Brandon C.,"Dallas, TX",126,120,2,1.0,1/6/2017,Giving a 1 star review is giving way too much credit. We placed our order and my wife specifically said no mushrooms.  When you are pregnant you can't eat mushrooms.  Obviously BJ's staff do not listen. We waited for our pizza. We look at the food ready to be served and there is our pizza.  After 7 minutes sitting under the food warmer the waiter decided to bring our pizza and when it arrived FULL of mushrooms.  It's one thing to pick 1-2 mushrooms off but when it was loaded we had to tell them we could not eat it.

Spicy pepper burger: Delicious! Juicy and the crunchy fried peppers made it great. Oh, and the super buttery buns didn't hurt. You have a choice of thick or thin fries on the side. I went with the thin, which was a good choice. Crispy. 2. Blackened chicken salad: My friend really enjoyed it. I tried the chicken with the cranberries and blueberries in the salad and it was decent. The table next to us had a deep dish pizza that looked phenomenal.

Joey T.,"Simi Valley, CA",217,455,77,2.0,6/8/2015,"BJ's. Goes right in the same category as Cheesecake factory, chilies, and similar restaurants with big menus and TVs and anything you could want.  Normally I think that BJs is a little better than it's direct competitors. However the BJs in in Westwood is not up to snuff with other BJs. It's smaller, and the service was not nearly as good. It seems like they were trying real hard, but with the NBA game on it took us FOREVER to get a table. The food took a long time to come out. Some people got the wrong dishes, some people had cold food. It seemed like they were having a real rough night.  I got a french dip and it was okay. I wish there was not globs of aoli on it because it kinda took over, and the fries were cold, but aside from that it was okay. Just a tad more than I wish I would have paid.  As always the atmosphere during the sports game was fun, and the pazookies are to die for.

Angelina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,18,2,2.0,4/13/2017,"This place is inconsistent AF. I go to lunch here sometimes because it is a 1-minute walk from my office. The food doesn't blow my mind but I don't have any complaints. I stick to the same stuff all the time, tortilla soup, salad, burgers, pizookie. The problem at the Westwood location is that sometimes the service is amazing: they refill your water before you run out, they ask if you need more of anything, and best of all they actually acknowledge you when you come in. Today was not like that. After seating down for about 7 minutes and having 3 of the servers give me really odd looks, I finally got someone to take my order. No ""hello"" or a smile. Then someone else brought my food and I didn't see the waiter again for a good 45 minutes. I got the unlimited soup and salad, which means I get refills but I was never offered one. I had to ask someone else for the soup to go and the check. They gave me a cup of the soup, no bag, no napkins, no spoon, and no  toppings (what's tortilla soup without the tortilla chips on top?!).

Jay K.,"Los Angeles, CA",231,315,569,4.0,3/22/2015,"I'm going to give it a four for MY experience but in terms of food definitely a 3. As always we start with parking! Read yelp and basically discovered parking is horrendous, but to my surprise it's not AS bad as you would think. It's not a private lot so you're going to end up paying but like most people said it's a flat rate after 6 or by the hour in lots/garages during the day. You can also do meters but if you think you're gonna stay longer than 2 hours might be better not to.  I went before 6 on a Saturday and found a small lot right behind Whole Foods that cost 5 bucks. There was a parking garage across the street that was 3 bucks flat after 6. There's a lot more garages than I expected. But honestly if I can just find parking relatively close to my location I'm pretty dang happy.  I joined 3 other ladies that night and for the most part enjoyed it. Company definitely makes up for lack of food quality.   This was my first time at this location and I kind of enjoyed being on the top floor, it felt a bit more intimate for us.  The food was okay to me. I got a pasta instead of a pizza for the first time and it was meh...  I'm a die hard deep dish fan and actually really enjoy those pizzas but I decided to try the chicken Alfredo.  It was okay. I just wasn't blown away, there wasn't anything great about the sauce or the chicken, but I was content.   Service was okay. Nice guy. Got switched to a woman half way, wasn't as great but wouldn't complain that much. Now the reason I say 4 stars for us, or else this would be a basic 3 star review, is because we ordered 2 pizookies. One came out fine but the other took so long that our friends had already eaten theirs. Turns out the order was made incorrectly twice, but the chef came out to our table personally apologized for the mistake and said the pizookie was on the house. Now that was good service for an honest mistake.  I know people have talked about bad service but for the most part it was an enjoyable pleasant night. Will I come back to this location? It's a maybe. But still not a bad night! P. S salted caramel pizookie didn't live up to the expectations I had, was way too salty for my taste buds.

Travis S.,"Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles, CA",2,12,,2.0,4/14/2013,"We sat on the patio which had some great ambiance, and even though it was a bit chilly out, the outdoor heaters kept the temperature great. Unfortunately we literally waited for 10 minutes after we were seated before anyone greeted us, and that was after one of our party went back inside to tell someone we were there.  Drinks came very slowly, although the server was witty about their poor service. The sampler platter was kind of slow in coming too, although I thought pretty much everything on it was pretty good. Artichoke dip was fantastic, but could have come with more chips. The deep dish pizza was fairly good as advertised. The last negative was that a manager opened the sliding glass panel next to us leading into the indoor dining area. I assume this was because it was getting stuffy inside, but it created a draft at our table of air rushing into the restaurant that was quite unpleasant. We were not asked at all if this bothered us. Another of our party paid so I couldn't be too unhappy, but I probably wouldn't come back on my own dime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=160

Felicia T.,"Las Vegas, NV",80,276,192,1.0,3/5/2015,"What's happened to this place? Perhaps my tolerance level for horrendous service has lowered as I get older, or we were unlucky to be stuck with a miserable waitress, but I won't be returning to this location. Granted the food was expected, but the service left a very bad taste in our mouths.  We went during the Christmas break, so the UCLA kids were out, we found parking outside, the restaurant was only about 30% full. We were seated at a booth, almost immediately. All good start.  Then it went downhill from there, there was no redeeming the evening. Our waitress (Kathy i think was her name) has got to be the most miserable waitress we've ever had the pleasure interacting, in our years of dining out. She clearly didn't want to be there and seemed to have a personal hostility against us. We asked for water and iced tea. We didn't get them until the appetizer came (she never even walked by, so we had to flag another waiter who brought our drinks for us). She didn't drop off the appetizer (someone else from the kitchen brought out our Carnitas Fries and Chile Verde). The fries were good, and the chile verde tangy, tart, a bit spicy. No problem with the food. The main courses came out - deep dish BBQ chicken pizza and Jambalaya- this time carried over by another gentleman, who also ended up removing the appetizer plate. He asked us how it was, and for us to enjoy the entrees. By this time, our drinks were empty, but our waitress hasn't once come back to check up on us. In the meantime, she has refilled drinks for the other patrons around us. At this point I got self conscious and started thinking if she was maybe not fond of Asians (moi). But she works by UCLA for god's sakes, and not Podunk, Ohio, so Asians are not uncommon.  The host refilled our drinks for us, he also asked how we found the food. Both were dishes we've had before and so we liked them fine. The jambalaya this evening was a couple notches spicier than other times, and they sprinkled chipotle peppers all around the plate, so it was rather intrusive (good for presentation, I guess).  We managed to flag her down for our 3rd round of refill, at which point,we wanted the remaining half of the pizza to go and asked for our check. She didn't bother asking how the food went, etc. This is the kicker: she had the audacity to smile so widely when dropping off the check, and on it, was a big hand-drawn smiley face, a ""Thanks"" and her name. Unreal. We gave her a 15% tip in cash and took off. I'd have given less but it was the holidays, and i didn't want to be chased down for what she'd definitely argue to be great service. Her negative energy tells me she'd stoop that low.  Management needs to get a better handle on who they hire, but with the place being constantly busy when school is in, and their ""who cares if our service sucks, these kids only care about their beers"" attitude, i guess they don't feel the need to try at all. I've had way better service at iHop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=160

Alice W.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,11,14,2.0,7/3/2013,"The best part about BJ's is the food... So good! This location in Westwood doesn't really have the happy hour specials like other BJ's aka there are no specials on drinks. The happy hour they have include half off mini pizza's (so 5-6$ for a 6in deep dish pizza) and 2$ off appetizers. Service is a little slow and not the best. We came in later around 11pm and happy hour starts at 10pm (I called earlier to check), and when we got there, the waitress told us that this particular location had no happy hour at all, but after speaking to her manager, they let us have the happy hour specials. Then our order was wrong so it twice as long as it did to come out. The place is not too big either, one of the smaller BJ's I've seen. It is a bit pricey too, even at happy hour specials... but the food was GOOD (Two stars for food!). We tried... Hand Tossed Gourmet Five Meat Pizza - This pizza was so good! 14'' of deliciousness... The crust was crisp and so fresh and the cheese was perfect. All the meats had so much flavor. This was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. A bit pricey though. About $20 for this thin crusted pizza. Piranha Pale Ale Nachos -- this was a ""shareable"" appetizer and they do mean ""shareable"". It was huge! Normally $9.95 but we got $2 off for the appetizer. It was really good, and way too much. On the menu it said the whole thing was over 2000 calories. This plate is enough for 4 people.

Cindy T.,"Elk Grove, CA",51,19,6,1.0,11/27/2012,"One word: Terrible. Note: This is an extremely long review, and I apologize for all the space it takes up. If you don't feel like reading all of this (it really is quite tedious), let me just summarize for you: Don't ever eat here. The service is awful, the quality of the food is mediocre, and it's simply not worth the money and wait. For those who do want to read about my experience: I went to this particular BJ's for the first time for my birthday earlier this month, and I left feeling extremely disappointed. I've eaten at BJ's a couple times before (in my hometown of Elk Grove) so I had similar expectations for this location... And they were by no means met. We get there around 8 pm on a Saturday night, and there's a crowd of people outside waiting for a table, which is nothing out of the ordinary for a BJ's restaurant. The host said that the wait would be approximately 30-45 minutes, which we were fine with. Our group was composed of 5 people, so we figured we could keep each other entertained for a half hour. But what we COULDN'T do, however, is keep ourselves entertained for an hour and a half, which was the time we actually had to wait! Every time we went in to check our position, the host would apologize and tell us that we would be the next table seated! Horrible. We honestly should've left at this point but instead we decided to wait it out. We finally got our table, and were seated in the center of the room. The place was loud and packed with people, and it didn't help that the UCLA v. WSU game was on that night. Naturally, a friendly waitress came by, apologized for the wait, and handed us menus and took our orders. One of my friends and I got our own personal pizzas, while my other three friends decided to share a large. Someone also ordered a pizookie, and the waitress said she'd put in the order midway through the meal so that it'd arrive right when we finished eating. The wait for our food was ridiculous - it was 30 minutes! We asked our waiter (sometime during the wait we got a new server - I'm guessing the waitress ended her shift) how long it was going to take, and he kept on repeating that the pizza was nearly done and that the chefs just needed to put it on the plate... By that point we were ravenous. After about 20 minutes in I was getting impatient, and couldn't help myself from continuously glancing at the food that was laid out on the counter above the stoves. (You know, where the cooks place the food after it's done cooking and is ready to be served.) I noticed that there were several plates of food just sitting there for the last 10 minutes... And yup, you guessed it - when we finally got our food, one of those plates turned out to be my pizza. Needless to say, the pizza definitely did not live up to expectation. Even in the midst of my hunger I was definitely put off by the quality and taste, which was only average. It was soggy at the bottom and lukewarm everywhere else. I had to hold up the tip or else the toppings would fall off! We all finished our food in 10 minutes or less - you can imagine how hungry we were. One of my friends asked for a birthday pizookie for me, which arrived in about 10 minutes. However, my friend's pizookie never arrived! We notified our waiter, and he said that the order was never put in and that he'd get it started right away... Which meant more waiting.  We waited a bit more, but all the guys were starting to get pissed off (not surprisingly). We asked our waiter where the pizookie was, and he rudely responded and told us they were working on it. After 10 minutes passed, we decided that we'd rather just leave than wait for the pizooki. We called our waiter over and told him to cancel it, to which he replied sharply, ""You want to just cancel it? It's already made. It's almost here now. You can, but the cook is about to put it on the plate. He's probably putting it on the plate right now as we speak. You sure you want to cancel it? Because you can, but just know that it's pretty much done."" Wait, what? Did our waiter just give us attitude? We agreed to wait for the pizooki, but in our minds this was the last straw. There was no way in hell we were ever going here again. It came out a couple minutes later, but of course the warmth and sweetness of enjoying a warm ice cream topped pizookie had long evaporated.  Horrible place, horrible quality, horrible service. Everything was just horrible. I miss the Elk Grove location. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=160

(Yes, I said it! :)) I never really have salad cravings, but that day in particular was strange. With the 100 degree weather and whatnot. So I remembered I saw an ad for the (old) ""new"" Santa Fe salad in the BJ's menu with a ginormous picture of greens, avocados, grated cheese, corn, tomatoes, tortilla chip strips, etc etc. It just looked YUMMY!!!  Bf got his usual pasta and I ordered my Santa Fe with blackened chicken. It was...simply put - ridiculously, mind-blowingly, omg-what-is-this - amazing! Pretty much, it tasted like the insides of a fresh taco poured over lettuce and avocado slices. Sounds plain, but it was actually the PERFECT blend. I'm not usually a salad type of girl, but I know a good salad when I eat one. And this is the jackpot. (Bf REALLY doesn't like salad, but even he thought it was amazing. Can't argue w/ that!)

Haley A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1263,3,1,1.0,12/12/2017,"I love BJ's food in general, but I am giving this location a 1 star because of the manager named Kimberly who was EXTREMELY rude to me. I work for Doordash and I was simply coming to pick up an order and she was the hostess at the front. When I came in she already had a seemingly mean look on her face, and then I said ""Hi, I'm here to pick up an order for Doordash"" and she replied with an attitude that she hasn't received the order yet and that she's been having issues all day with them. She seemed to be getting mad at me for just being there... Anyways, I contact doordash about the issue and they call her to configure it... I go back in to ask if she finally has gotten the order and she says (in a rude away again) and seems very annoyed with me, that she just got it, so I ask how long does she think it might take since I'm delIvering food and I don't want my customer to be upset... And she replies in a very mean way ""I don't know that because I literally just put in the order and if you could just wait over there please"" so at this point I ask her to not give me attitude and that I'm just doing my job... She continued to be even more rude and asked for my name, so I asked her for her name and if I could speak to a manager. She let me know that SHE was the manager and I was very surprised to hear this because I felt very disrespected and for a manager this was TERRIBLE customer service, even if I'm not eating here and just picking up an order. So, now as I am waiting for the food to be ready (which is also taking forever), I am writing this. Please have a word with this manager Kimberly. She made my visit here very unpleasant. UPDATE: after ALL that waiting for about 25 mins... She calls doordash to let them know that I have to leave and I ended up not even being able to finish the order and receive my original pay for it.

Karen L.,"Los Angeles, CA",186,127,157,3.0,9/3/2016,"BJ's is your typical American family restaurant/sports bar: TVs playing the latest game hanging on the walls, laminated menus, a busy atmosphere, etc. I've been here a couple times, and out of all the entrees I've tried, I think the balsamic chicken stood out to me as the best. But, their food isn't the kind that makes you want to come back a second time. The flavours are unmemorable and the variety of food that they serve can be found at a multitude of other similar style restaurants.  They do have one saving grace though...the PIZOOKIE. It's a cookie cooked in a little pizza pan that is served with ice cream on top. I got the monkey bread pizookie, which tasted like a cinnamon roll and was fluffy with caramelized edges that blended perfectly with the vanilla ice cream on top. I would definitely recommend monkey bread over other more traditional flavours like salted caramel, cookies and cream, etc. though those are great too. If you're in the area and don't like any of the other restaurants or want to try a pizookie, then BJ's might be the place for you.

It does not have its own bar (which limits its drink menu to only BJ's brewery, and mostly non-alcoholic drinks). It has both an upstairs and downstairs area, which literally could have been just one floor plan... the organization of this place is really weird and small. Only two servers are running the whole place. Our server was Kayla. Super sweet girl! I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya, which is my go-to choice at BJ's and my cousin ordered a Chicken BBQ Pizza. My food came in earlier and our server apologized because she put in the wrong order and they made the wrong pizza therefore we had to wait a little more. Which was completely fine! She was very upset and constantly apologized, gave us free garlic bread, and said that dessert was on her, which was a very sweet offer. I understand, because I'm a waitress myself and do make similar mistakes, therefore we were very patient with our orders and the service we were receiving. I was looking forward to ordering a brew, but there weren't many choices, so I went with a Strawberry Lemonade instead and it was delicious! Refills were constantly being brought.

Catherine P.,"Los Angeles, CA",250,73,114,4.0,7/10/2016,"This place lies in Westwood in the area around UCLA so it's a great place to go for group gatherings. Their lunch menu is great and decently priced, but dinner is good as well. Overall food was average, pizzas and burgers aren't out of the extraordinary but they are still good. My favorite thing to get here are definitely the pazookies, they are amazing! If you don't know what that is, it is a soft warm cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top! The ghiradelli chocolate one is my absolute favorite and perfect if you're a chocolate lover like me. Their beers/ciders are also very good. My favorite is the berry burst cider, yum! Service overall has been OK. Service tends to be on the slower side, since they always seem to be short of staff, but the waiters and waitresses are all very nice. So in general, it's not a bad place to go eat at, would definitely recommend eating here if you're with a big group!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=20
Richard P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",103,89,52,2.0,1/17/2017,"This place is whack as hell. We came in around 11pm and the place wasn't too poppin besides a single large party of about 14. For some reason when they were done with the dishes meant for this large party, they just left it under the heat lamps for literally 15+ minutes. I'm over here like... Wtf? That better not be our food. It turned out to be there food, but sure enough they gave our food the same treatment.  So when i got my jalapeño burger it was lukewarm and unsatisfying since it had just been sitting under the heat lamp for so long. Keep in mind there is not many customers here. The only possible explanation for keeping it under the heat lamps for so long is if they wanted to serve it to everyone at once. But Damn you gonna just leave it there for 15 minutes?  They either forgot my girlfriend's meal or they just were slow as hell because by the time she got her pasta dish, the other 4 of us in the party had essentially finished our meal. As an apology, her meal was free and we got a free pizookie, which keeps this from being a 1 star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=20

In addition, BJ's secured various other reservations of 30+ people at the same time of our fundraiser, causing many people to stay standing and waiting over 30 minutes to be seated.

Rana S.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",43,135,727,2.0,7/30/2017,"Gosh. Honestly we should have just had the pizzoki (sp?) and left. I haven't been to BJs in for we and today reminded me why. With the exception of the cool architecture,  lighting, and sports (although nothing interesting was on) this place is less than average.  We went around 2:30 in the afternoon for a late lunch. The place was pretty empty. I think there must have been a total of 6 or 7 tables occupied but the place was full of employees all running around seemingly to know where. You know where everyone plays busy, that was the case here.  We were seated at a booth in the main bar area which was great for tv watching- although, like I said, nothing interesting to follow.  We were first approached by a waitress who took our drink order and asked if we were ready to order- we literally had just been seated. Odd. Anyways she left. A second person brought out our drinks. Then a third employee came and introduced himself as our waiter. So confusing.  Anyways we ordered a spinach artichoke dip to start; a Mediterranean deep dish; some chicken wings; and a salad. The food is SO EXCESSIVELY SALTY. All of it. I am not exaggerating. All the food: from the dip to the pizza and chicken wings. All of it was so salty. If you have blood pressure issues, be careful here.  The dip was the highlight. It was the least salty. The chicken, which is called a siracha something chicken wing, and it tasted like vinegar. The pizza was really just a deep pan of bread, with a little bit of pesto, some salty chicken cubes and kalamata olives. All salty and just not fresh. They assemble food. Don't cook good. The salad was also good. It was quite healthy but the blueberries in it were not fresh. The food was just meh at best. Honestly we didn't enjoy any of it.  Then, I took the girls to the restroom and had my partner ask for ranch. We came back and the ranch hadn't been right out. Of course at this pint we are the waiter just walking back and forth, with determination.i didn't see him doing anything that would take time away from a cup of ranch, but nonetheless it took him a good 15 minutes to bring the ranch.  Anyways it wasn't our best meal. I am convinced the salt amount could cause a heart attack. It was out of control.

Jerald D.,"Los Angeles, CA",242,7,,5.0,10/3/2017,"I usually come here for birthdays and get-togethers with classmates but I decided to go yesterday by myself in honour of getting a free Pizookie, and as usual with every time I've gone here, I have never been disappointed with the service or quality of the food here. When I walked in yesterday around lunch time, the place was surprisingly empty, it was only me and two other patrons during the time I was there eating, but I took the assumption that everyone was in class and would be coming in later, I typically come here at night, but I guess the afternoon holds a different crowd for BJs. I sat down and was approached by the waiter (who actually didn't tell me his name... shame... he was really good.) and he handled my selection of food well and responded back quickly with anything I needed. I assumed this was because of the lack of patrons in the restaurant, but I wasn't complaining with the quick service. I only ordered the classic BJs burger and added bacon onto to it so I can push myself over the $10 threshold to get a free Pizookie, and the burger was extremely satisfying and the fries were at a satisfying level. The Pizookie was just the icing on the cake of my visit, not because it was free, but because it's a staple of the BJs restaurants all around. I had a quick in-and-out experience with this place which was fine because that's what I needed because I had class a few hours afterwards and I wanted my Pizookie fix. I really wish I got my waiter's name because although with an empty restaurant, he was very attentive and looked like he cared about the people he serves.

Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",1451,2370,6598,5.0,6/12/2016,"I LOVE BJ's!  And I missed it so much.  My now husband (then fiance) visited BJ's in Westwood in March of this year and he loves it as much as I do.  We had just landed at LAX and were so exhausted and realized we'd rather go to a sit-down restaurant as opposed to waiting around at In N Out's drive-through line, so we made our way over to BJ's in Westwood!  We were able to find street parking not too far away (the Broxton Lot is usually reliable, but was not open that evening).   We both went with burgers!  I went with the Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe (housemade guacamole, smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, red onions, tomatoes, and jalapens, while my husband (then fiance) ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger (with applewood smokd bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, mayonnaise, and BJ's signature burger sauce).  My husband (then fiance) also ordered a beer, while I ordered wine.  BJ's is famous for their beer (and their tastings), so he definitely was not disappointed. We both LOVED BJ's!  I have so many good memories there, including my 21st birthday dinner, numerous other friends' birthday dinners, and other events!  Their burgers, pizzas, and pizookies are spectacular!   I will continue going there for years to come :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood

Tremaine E.,"Los Angeles, CA",560,263,316,3.0,10/25/2016,"BJ's is the restaurant equivalent of PC: political correctness. It's the go-to place in Westwood when you want to make a totally vanilla choice that will not offend anybody's taste buds, yet it doesn't really say anything at all of worth.  Its menu of everything from salads to burgers to jambalaya (which I like the most yet is the most expensive at around $18) is so expertly crafted such that any goer simply cannot say, ""oh, I can't eat anything here."" And yet, when the food comes out, it's so un-noteworthy.  You know how when you go to a restaurant and then the dish someone ordered finally hits the table and then everyone goes up in a chorus of ""Oooohhh that looks goooodddd""? Yeah, I have never heard that at BJ's. It's usually just a nod for acknowledgment of receipt. That said, I mean, the beers on tap here are kind of cool--but again, not very noteworthy.  So if you want a place where everyone can eat, where there will always be a seat, then BJ's is the place to beat. Oh, yeah, and pizookies--now PIZOOKIES are ""Oooohhh that looks goooodddd"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood

It was my second time there, the first time I was with a group of people and I ordered the Mediterranean pizza and was really bad but the service was okay! Nothing special but not bad. Second time we went there for birthday celebration and it was a surprise for BD boy. Upon our arrival we secretly told them to bring a cake after our food and surprise the guy but here is what happened: We ordered our food as always and asked for drinks, the drinks came out really late almost with the food, we needed to ask our server to fill out our waters but it seemed he didn't care. We even told him we're gonna drink a lot of water in a funny way to have his attention but didn't work! We were still working on our food and they brought us the check without even asking if we wanna have dessert or not and the server totally forgot about the birthday boy!!  We told the guy who bring us the check to talk to our server but he said he's already gone!! Without even notifying us. At the end they ruined the surprise birthday and we had an awful dinner! I will definitely not gonna be back in this BJ's and recommend everyone to try other locations. Anything would be better than this trashy restaurant.

Ishita G.,"Los Angeles, CA",172,15,1,3.0,7/27/2017,"BJ's is extremely average food-wise. The burgers are always have disproportionate condiments, the fries are flailing, and the deep-dish pizza is also quite average. The nacho pizza is above average (pretty good), and they have a good selection of beers, though. The brunch pancakes are also fat and mealy. All in all, the food is just about okay. But the pizookie is just amazing, they have a lot of variety in pizookies, the big one is good to share between two people, and the mini-pizookie is easily finished by one. My personal favorite is the macadamia nut and white chocolate. People should honestly ditch Diddy Riese and stick to BJ's pizookies. The place always has tons of seating, the servers are always sweet and chirpy, overall pretty good vibe for a late night snack, but there's very few things you could truly like on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood

Mohib Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,363,3201,3.0,1/18/2013,"While I have been here many times in the past, the review below will reflect my past visit earlier this month. Coming here after hiking the Rustic Canyon trail, I ordered a grilled turkey burger within minutes of being seated immediately for a holiday lunch. Service was intermittent, and slow at points. The waitress also managed to spill water onto one of my friends, however, this was a mistake and quickly dismissed. However, what shocked me was their slow service during this holiday. I realize it may have been due to poor staffing, but after taking a look around there seemed to be quite a few staffers and folks in the kitchen. Furthermore, the restaurant was half full. It didn't make sense. When I received my burger, it was not piping hot as I had hoped. It was moderate in taste, and as you may suspect, it wasn't as tasty as a beef burger. Unlike a beef hamburger, the turkey burger was the healthier option.  I should have ordered a pizza, as they can be quite tasty here. I'll be back here for probably a UCLA event, hopefully not on too busy of a night as they tend to get packed here. The location is small, and parking options are limited to private lots and meters that stay packed during operating hours.

My husband let her know that the guy we had asked did not help us at all and just went to so stand there doing nothing.. then we finally got a hold of our new waitress and asked her if the waitress before her had charged us for a pint or a pitcher because we had ordered a pitcher.. she went to go check and said she had only charged  for a pint that she would win that.. then she came back with a full pitcher, which my husband told her she shouldn't have filled it up since he had the pint already.. she said that was the least she could do so we thanked her.. ask my husband starts pouring himself his beer from the pitcher he said I just saw something come out of the pitcher then he waited for the foam in the glass of beer to settle the say that indeed something was in it.. a piece of pepperoni! Disgusting! We didn't even order anything with pepperoni!  We then got a hold of the our waitress and let her know what had happened and just told her not to bring us any more beer at all.. this was the worse experience i have ever had in a BJ'S restaurant. .On the plus side the food we ordered was delicious, too bad for the rest..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=80

Unfortunately, this BJ's is the smallest one I've ever seen, and does not have any bar seating (-1 star for size/lack of bar). There are also no discounts on alcohol during happy hour, but to be fair it's a state policy because of it's location being so close to a university...but c'mon really? No alcohol during happy hour...is just like any other hour.  I've been to this BJ's both during peak and low hours and really, I haven't noticed much of a change in the service (-1 star for service). The waiters are less than attentive and do not know how to manage crowds or provide any assurance. Beware if you're coming during any sports game, especially the play offs/finals because this place will be packed...I mean PACKED. So much so, that the kitchen and chefs come to a stand still and just stop and watch the game along with everyone else. What's worse is that once the game finished, the food still took a long time to come out.  The meal prices are pretty high for what you get. The food is standard, and I wouldn't consider the options creative in any way, just your usual American food, with way too many calories for the average 2,000 calories/day ""diet."" (-1 star for price). What also bugs me is that the fries are really a hit or miss on any given day - sometimes they come out cold, sometimes they are less than crispy...you just never know.  My entrees of choice include: balsamic chicken, BJ's favorite pizza, and the turkey club.  Overall, BJ's is meh. I'd come here if others I am with want to, or if I'm craving a pizookie, but other than that...I see no reason in coming to BJ's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=100

Jo S.,"North Hollywood, CA",219,688,3223,3.0,10/1/2013,"We've been going to BJ's on and off for more than 10 years, particularly at this location. It's a good option for dining in Westwood, especially since a lot of other places in the area went out of business recently (so sad to see). You can count on BJ's for a fun meal. We like their Jeremiah Red draft beer (amber), their burgers (I used to love their classic burgers on a French garlic baguette - they don't have them in their menu anymore and the California one (with avocado) and my husband likes their BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. Their fish and chips dish was OK, I had better and my husband wasn't thrilled with their battered shrimp - don't know if they still serve them. Sure, plenty of calories here, but from time to time it's OK to splurge. Service is usually good. It's a smaller location, I don't mind it, although I could do with less screens on the walls. And another minus, they don't have Happy Hour here! Recently we saw the ads w. their 2 for $20 deal. I called this location and they said they'll serve it till Nov. 11th. When we got in, the hostess didn't know if they still serve it, but they do. No adds around to let people know about it. You can get a small salad or a soup each, share a medium pizza and share a pizookie as desert for $19, 95. Not a bad deal.  I got their house salad, nothing great, just iceberg lettuce, 2 slices of cucumbers, 2 slices of tomatoes, shredded carrots and croutons. My husband got their tortilla soup, that was much better with chunks of avocados in it. He would have liked it hotter, but it was really good. We picked the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza (w. grilled garlic chicken, bacon, chopped tomatoes and onions, jack and cheddar cheese), it's plenty of it, took some leftovers at home. Very good, I enjoyed the crust, the fresh chopped tomatoes and red onions.  We picked the Triple Chocolate Ghirardelli Pizookie dessert and enjoyed it. Even if we ate at BJ's, many times before we never tried their desserts, their portions are so big that we never had room left for desert. So, if you're in the area, check it out, they have an extensive menu (besides pizza-s and burgers) and brew their beers, so they have a great selection. It's an OK place, nothing fancy.

Maybe I'm just getting old and can't eat grease and sugar anymore. Got a bacon cheeseburger. It was OK. I wanted In n' Out but my friend wanted chicken.  Go to In N Out if you want a burger.

It can get a bit crowded, but you should be fine if you come early/make reservations ahead of time. It's usually pretty crowded in the evenings, but the wait shouldn't be too long. BJ's is a common place for groups, so it can get pretty loud and feel a bit cramped, but the service is still decent. I would recommend the upper loft area, which is more secluded and quieter for a more intimate group gathering. Their deep dish pizzas are the way to go. The Barbecue Chicken and Great White are a couple of my favorites. The pastas are alright, but they are more known for their pizza.

My favorite dishes at BJ's are the pan pizzas and the large stuffed potatoes.  You can get a specialty pizza or you can pick your own toppings.  Doesn't really matter to me because I think the crust is what makes it so good.  I like the veggie stuffed potato.  It's definitely the biggest potato I have ever seen.  I always am only able to eat half of one because it's so big!!!  The food is a good deal for the quality that you're getting.  Get a pizza to share with the table and then get your own potato :).  And of course, you cannot go to BJ's without getting a delicious pizookie.  Oh man.  Pizookie is definitely one of my favorite desserts ever.  A hot, gooey cookie with scoops of vanilla ice cream on top.  Mannn.  I'm craving it right now!!!  OMNOMNOM I don't drink, so I can't comment on the brewery, but my friends do love the variety of the drinks menu.

It was good with the sesame soy sauce. Also, it was a healthy choice! So if you're looking for something yum and good for you, this is fit for you! For the main course, my friend and I shared a small southwestern pizza. Since we are relatively small girls who were saving some space for dessert, the small ended up being alot so we to-goed the leftover two slices. But the pizza was pleasant. Of course, no deep dish pizza in California can compare to the OG deep dish pizzas of Chicago but it was okay.  But I would say the dessert was the best part of our meal!

However, the service and management is such a disappointment. This place does get 2 stars, however, because service can be hit or miss. Sometimes, you can get decent service if you're really lucky and its not busy. Although, an empty restaurant still doesn't guarantee decent nor attentive service at this BJ's location. After one unbelievably dreadful visit, I decided to write a little review about my experience to BJ's through their official website. I said nothing nasty, just saying that I will be a returning customer since I am a huge fan of the Great White pizza, but that I really wish service would be more courteous, attentive, and pleasant. The manager of this specific location called me just a day after leaving a VM asking to chat about my experience. I called back a day after and we chatted about the experience. Again, nothing nasty was said nor exchanged and since we stated that we'll be back again, the manager politely offered a gift card and asked for the address to mail it to. I was stoked! However, it has been over 2 months and I have yet to receive such ""giftcard"". I've been in Westwood for over 4 years now, and I will be moving out.

I enjoy the restaurant when I dine there in Orange County - can't Los Angeles provide me the same experience? Guess not. The girls and I decided to come here during Dank Restaurant Deals week for Westwood and UCLA students. I also have still never ventured to BJ's in Westwood before, either so I thought it would be good to play it safe with a place that I am familiar with.  Apparently, BJ's gets very busy every day of the week. There were multiple parties waiting outside because it is VERY small inside. I wasn't used to this particluar size of the restaurant since the other BJ's that I've been to are quite roomy. We were given a wait time of about 35-45 minutes, which kind of stunk since we were hungry but we were already there. What are girls to do while they wait for their table? SHOP, OF COURSE! We hit up a store nearby to kill time since it was cramped inside and outside. About 35 minutes later, we come back to BJ's because it was the time that the hostess had originally told us to return. However, when we arrived, not only were the waitresses unhelpful and ignoring us, but when we finally were able to grab her attention, she told us another 15 minutes. Understandable, there are people who are still hanging at their tables even though they're done with their meals and have paid...but the two hostesses at the stand ignored us for a good 5+ minutes...and we were standing right in front of them.  After about 20 MORE minutes, we were seated...at a table that was open for quite a while, we realized. Onto ordering... The girls had been raving about the hand-crafted root beer and how delicious it tasted. I had never tried it before whenever I had gone to a BJ's but I decided to play it safe and have water. I should have ordered my own root beer, because when I tried my friend's drink, it was absolutely FRESH and AMAZING! It wasn't carbonated like your typical root beer and didn't taste like it was filled with preservatives. This root beer was light and didn't burn your throat like the initial taste of soda. Awesome. For food, I decided to go with the BBQ Beef Sandwich with a side of shoe-string thin fries. This dish was honestly just very plain. The sandwich came with tender Angus roast beef in BBQ sauce, melted provolone cheese on a toasted garlic cheese French roll topped with our crunchy, sweet onion strings. The roll was a bit too crunchy... yet soggy and I definitely didn't taste any garlic cheesiness. Sad. The Angus beef was actually tasty - it was thinly sliced and the proportion of the BBQ was nice.  All in all, the sandwich as a whole was just very MEH. It definitely wasn't the greatest BBQ sandwich that I have ever had but I wasn't expecting it to begin with.. My friends ordered mini pizzas and really enjoyed it. I should have gone with a mini pizza, too. Sad life.  It took forever to get seated, forever to get our food, and forever to get our bill...then forever for them to take the bill.

Drinks came fast enough.  When placing order, I asked for the atlantic salmon, which comes with soup or salad.  I chose the clam chowder.  My sister ordered a fish dish as well, and the menu said that it also comes with a side salad or cup of soup.  Alex confidently told my sister that it does not.  This got my attention, because I've read the menu.  But, I let it go. Alex accidentally left a menu on the table, so I took a look at it.  We were right, my sister's dish came with soup or salad. Eventually drink refills came from another server, so Alex must've gotten slammed or overwhelmed.  We flag down this server and mention that one of the meals came with soup or salad, and would like to order it.  We order a salad, no problem. So the main dishes come, no soup or salad.  The server (different from Alex) comes and we tell her.  She comes back with the salad and soup. So, we eat our salad and soup while our main dish sits on the table and gets cold. Food was typical. Nothing special, but it tasted good.  Alex comes by in the MIDDLE of our meal and asks if we want dessert.  We kind of looked at each other as if to say ""uh, we're not even there yet..."" and said, ""Maybe later."" Later never came. Alex never came back to take a dessert order.  My niece and nephew usually like dessert, but said F it because they waited for so long.  We waited close to 25 minutes from the time we were done eating until we got the check. It's been a while since i've had crap service anywhere, so I guess I was due.

He asked us to leave the restaurant until 7, and it was 6:50! Can you believe me?! We had professionals coming and I was so upset that we had to tell them that we got kicked out. It's like a time-out for 10 mins! When I compromised and asked if we could just stay downstairs in the restaurant, he said 'there's no way u can sit anywhere without disturbing the guests'. Hello?

Then they started bringing things to our table that we did not order (including an entire pizza and a couple drinks), and acted rudely when we explained we hadn't ordered those things.  Later, my friend had ordered a side salad, but they brought him the entree size.  When he explained he only wanted the smaller size, the busboy just said he would leave the entree size at our table and we could ""figure it out"" later.  Of course, no side salad ever came, but we were charged for the full entree size! When it came time to pay the bill, things got really bad.  Having a large group is complicated (and of course, they don't provide any ability to have separate checks), and we were confused by how much money we apparently owed.  After having everyone at the table go through the receipt line by line, we realized we were charged for an entire pizza, a pitcher of beer, and two pints that we never ordered OR received.  When we pointed this out, the waitress was rude to us, took the receipt we had which had all our notes on how much each person owed and which items they got, and brought us a new receipt that was about $20 less.  So we had to repeat the entire process again.  At this point, because the waitress kept disappearing, it had already taken well over half an hour just to figure out the check!  We were fed up with the process, and finally agreed to just pay the check as is, because we just wanted to leave. After we signed our receipts, the waitress told us that we were $24 over.  We were so tired of being in that awful place that we didn't even care about them overcharging us.  We left, and when I was walking down the street, the waitress came running after me.  Apparently, even though she never came to our table, she had no problem finding me in the street.  She then told me we were actually $24 UNDER, so I had to go back in and pay the remaining $24.  She then cracked a dumb joke about me having to pay on my own birthday, as if that was going to make me feel any better about the whole experience. I will NEVER come back to this BJs, and probably not any BJs.  I had a good birthday tradition going for three years, but it's over now.  I can't believe how much money we had to pay for terrible service (no choice because it's automatic gratuity!) and mediocre food (which, by the way, is one of the cheapest and easiest foods to make).  It was embarrassing for me and my friends, and we all had to pay way more than we should have just to leave that awful place.  Oh, and to cap it all off, the birthday pizookie is now about the size of a thimble.  It used to be wayyy bigger. So we had awful service, were charged way too much, were forced to give an 18% tip on an inflated bill, and spent almost an hour just trying to settle the check.  What a terrible way to celebrate a birthday.  I wouldn't even go back if they gave me a free pizza. EDIT: I called and spoke with the manager, who was very nice and understanding.  Truthfully, he said all the right things, and I am appreciative.  I liked BJs before, so maybe I will give them another chance someday, but not anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=260

To date, I've had their pizza three times, and not once have I been impressed. The flavor of the bread is a bit off, and there is just too much of it. I'd prefer a crispier crust, and more toppings/filling.   - 2 stars APPETIZERS: are alright. I've had the Ahi (Tuna) Poke once, which I would recommend if you're looking for something light. Today I tried the calamari, which was as mediocre as their pizza.  - 2 stars DESSERT: Of course, go for the pizookie. Crispy crust, with gooey, chocolate-y center topped with vanilla ice cream. But although I find myself loving it in small portions, it's just way too saccharine in large portions.   - Up to 3 stars OVERALL:  For UCLA students, a nice place to grab dinner and a pizookie for a birthday or date--although a bit on the pricier side.

I must say, however, your UCLA Westwood branch needs a good whipping! First, the greeter, who seamed to mean well, did not even know if the BJ beers were brewed on premises, nor did he express any sincere interest in the subject, I could tell from the way he promoted the ""session IPA"". My wife and I ordered beer. My wife's nut brown was OK, but my ""Imperial Stout"" was poor example. It had a malty sweetness in the beginning, but was insipid. It had a good amount of alcahol though. It was either an attempt not to ""scare"" the customer, a brew by people who don't know/ like the style. Or a first attempt at brewing the beer on a system that the brewers had not yet found little ways to adopt there existing equipment to, or scimping on ingredients. Second, my wife's Bacon Cheese Burger arrived first but very room temp! The french fries were shreds and not conventional as she ordered! Later my wife told me there was a long black hair in it, so she had to attempt to sterilize her pallet with beer and wash her mouth out!!!!!! Third my pizza was horrible!!! I specifically ordered the 15$ deep dish brewhouse, not the 20$!!! It was just above warm, and really under cooked, the vegetables were raw, the cheese and pepperoni were not caramelized and the ""sausages"" were little flavorless prepackaged crumbles (soy!?!) !! It reminded me of some wishy washy limp wristed  vegan pizza that the cook was trying to doctor up to please complaining omnivores!!!!  I lived in Chicago for a whole year and never had a piece of crap like that! I probaly just would have left a negative Yelp comment like everyone else, but at over 60$ I have to make this count, actually, the only reason I didn't complain in person is because I was urged not to and wasn't told about the hair until later!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=220

In contrast, the BJ's dinner salad was iceberg lettuce and barely anything else (2 disgusting translucent, water logged cucumber slices and a few greasy croutons).  BJ's probably spent 25 cents on my salad.  Senior Fred probably spent $2 on my salad.  That's the difference between a good restaurant and a slop house.

Food: The food is average, nothing absolutely delicious, but it's BJs. Their appetizers are probably the best things on their menu. I got the Thai Shrimp lettuce wraps. Quite difficult to eat without it spilling all over the place, but it wasn't bad. I really think that these menu items should be renamed to ""Thai inspired"" or ""Thai styled"" instead of just ""Thai"" because it's not very ""Thai"" at all.  Avocado eggrolls were pretty good. They're really similar to the ones from the Cheesecake Factory although their dipping sauces differ.

If you like Guiness, definitely give their porter a try.  - Great for big groups... and they always show Chargers games on the big screen. :) Bad:  - There can be long waits for dinner, especially if school is in session. They usually give out free pizza samples on nights with long waits, though.  - Not a fan of the sandwiches - the ""angus beef"" burgers always taste overcooked and the cold cut sandwiches are way pricey. When To Go:   - You want to enjoy great-tasting pizza and delicious beer with your friends. Tips:  - ""Four toppings OR MORE"" is a price category. So a pizza with 4 toppings costs the same as a pizza with 18 toppings - and yes, I've ordered a pizza with 18 toppings. :)  - They will still make chili cheese fries if you ask for it. You can also add bacon on this.  - You can order chili cheese (+bacon) onion strings (aka, a DEATH BLOSSOM), which are FANTASTIC.  - Free mini-pizookie (pizza-sized cookie with ice cream) on your birthday. Parking: Go the other side of Broxton (half a block east of the Broxton/Weyburn intersection) and go to the parking building on the left.

Mark B.,"Lafayette, CA",10,54,5,3.0,12/25/2010,"It's never a good sign when you visit an empty restaurant on Xmas Eve in Los Angeles.  This is because the ratio of Jews:Open Restaurants on Christmas in Los Angeles is really high.  For you liberal arts majors, this means there are a lot of hungry Jews (yours truly included) and not a lot of dining options.  As you may have surmised, we walked in the place and I didn't see many members of the tribe.  In fact, I was wondering if they were already closing up for the evening (wishful thinking). The Deep Dish pizza might taste good if: a) you've never had Deep Dish Pizza; b) you've only had frozen Deep Dish Pizza, or c) you haven't eaten in ten days.  Is there a sauce shortage in Los Angeles that hasn't hit the newspapers?  Maybe it's me but I really like to have some sauce on my pizzas. On the brighter side, the chopped salads were chopped. The appetizers were the kind of appetizers that really fill you up and make you feel lousy midway through your meal.  Since I had only eaten an Oatmeal cookie that morning (I thought Jews were supposed to fast on Christmas), I was famished and grabbed a few of the appetizers ... about five to ten minutes before they grabbed me.

They have a few flat screens that aren't well placed, but you can still follow whatever game is on at the time. BJ's is a solid chain that I can rely on for cheesy, chewy, thick, deep dish pizzas. I've been ordering the BBQ chicken pizza since I was a kid and it's always been solid. The spinach and artichoke pizza is good as well, which can also be found in dip and calzone form. If you like doughy bread, the pizzas and calzones are for you. The also have a good line of starters: nachos, spring rolls, chicken tenders, etc...  For a sandwich, the turkey cobb is solid, again with the doughy, cheese bread, bacon and bleu cheese sauce.   Their list of microbrews has been the same for years and offers a great variety from a light blonde ale to the dark porter and stout. The Piranha Pale Ale is a past favorite. They recently started brewing their own root beer which is made without high fructose corn syrup and actually tastes very good. Free refills on this too.  The pizookie (deep dish cookie) desserts are easily the best item on the menu. Save room. They have many flavors available, but I always go with the classic chocolate chip cookie with scoops of ice cream on top. It's very very good. They seem to have UCLA students staffing the place and the service is slow and many times I have had my food served incorrectly. However, if you make no substitutions or alterations you should be fine.  BJ's is always a safe option when I am in unfamiliar territory, loooking for some bar food. Rarely will I go there if I find myself hungry in Westwood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=280

Well apparently whenever it gets busy at this location the managers throw that right out the window!  We were booted from the place with no food or drinks because the rest of our party had been there for ""too long."" Even when the rest of the group took off shortly after we got there, they wouldn't let us continue to order and eat, and made ZERO attempt to find any kind of solution to the problem. They cancelled the orders we'd given to the waiter and basically said, ""better luck next time!"" The real bummer was that I had been seriously craving one particular pizza all day after thinking about it for weeks (yes, when you catch me daydreaming I'm usually thinking about food), but I was so put off by the way they treated us that I didn't even want to order it to go.  When will I finally get the satisfaction of my (2nd) favorite pesto pizza (see Upper Crust in Boston)??!!?!?!?!! I guess the search continues. Anyway, to be honest I understand the situation they were in--busy night, need the tables. But if your company is BUILT on keeping your customers happy this was the worst way to show it. The managers should make an effort to make things right, NOT be the ones who kick out well-paying and good-tipping customers who just want the satisfaction of some good pizza and cider. Compared to the other locations the customer service here SUCKS. Oh, and in case you need more reasons, there's always a wait and parking's impossible.

Amber B.,"Playa Vista, CA",1794,501,221,2.0,7/23/2009,"What more can really be said about BJ's? It's a chain, with mediocre food overall. I used to eat and drink here all the time in college - back when it was just a stumble away from my apartment so I could binge on all the beer I wanted and not have to worry about how I was going to make it home. This location also made for a popular meeting spot for all kinds of UCLA club/group activities - I remember holding a Hapa Club Welcome Back dinner here at least once. Back then I would stuff myself silly with pizookies (Are they even that great? They have ZERO appeal to me now), the potato wedges, the pizzas, burgers and of course it was all about the beer sampler! You actually get a good amount of beer for what you're paying. Flash forward a couple years to now. For some reason we receive about 1,000 ""Guest Appreciation Cards"" at my office good for either $5, $10, or $500. Even with the promise of basically unlimited free meals until the expiration date I didn't make it over to BJ's until one day before the end of the promo. Showed up for lunch and I think the only really positive thing I have to say about this last visit is that we were seated immediately and we had an excellent table upstairs with a view of the floor below so we could people watch...oh and our waiter, Blake, was real sweet.  So, my lunch companion's wedge salad and baked potato came out within a few minutes...yet I sat there for a good 10-15 minutes longer with nothing in front of me but my lemon water. Finally my cheddar broccoli soup came out, but not my BBQ chicken salad. I tried to eat the soup but in all honestly it was disgusting. It tasted like burned cheese for one thing AND there was wayyyyy too much cheese thrown on top. The cheese-to-broccoli ratio was atrocious. I don't even think I found a solid piece of broccoli in the entire bowl. I tried to stomach the soup because I was so hungry but I just couldn't do it. It took another 10 minutes for my salad to arrive and it was just meh...not very much chicken in it at all.

We shared a wedge salad, a bowl of clam chowder, and the BBQ pulled pork sliders.  The clam chowder tasted pretty good, but it's not like the clam chowder I'm used to.  It seemed to be thickened with corn starch, like a Chinese chicken corn soup, and it wasn't creamy and opaque like all the other clam chowder I've ever had.  Didn't taste too bad and had lots of clam chunks, but my roomie and I agreed that it tasted more like a potato soup. I liked the sliders.  The dish comes with four baby sandwiches, which is a nice upgrade from the three that every other restaurant serves.  We asked for more BBQ sauce, but only because we love to dip.  The thin cut fries are nice and crunchy!  They give a good ketchup-to-fry ratio.  Like I said, we love to dip. I'm giving three stars, but I think this location deserves to be bumped down a half star for the service.  We sat next to a table where an off-duty server was sitting and having a meal.  Our server seemed to be more interested in hearing what her friend was ordering and chatting with her than checking in on us.  Not to mention, we felt rushed into ordering before we had really decided on what we wanted.  I'm sure this was an off night, since the other times I've been here service has been fine.  Maybe when I come here for another birthday dinner I'll be able to add another star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=300

I guess it's a neutral choice with the multitude of menu items, and it's also in the neighborhood ... and, they serve that delicious chocolate chip pazookie. Recently, I had the chance to try one of their new pizza menu items - the Southwestern: chipotle tomato sauce with spicy blackened chicken, green chilies, cheddar cheese and diced tomatoes topped with fresh cilantro. It tasted much better than what I was expecting - sort of like a spicy supreme pizza with chicken and no olives. I haven't tried any of their brews yet because I usually order their root beer. IIRC, it's made by them also. I'd suggest trying it if you're a root beer fan. The aforementioned pazookie is awesome. Each spoonful of warm chocolate chip cookie with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top = yum. I have noticed that service tends to be slow here. On this visit, I only remember our server coming to our table three times during the entire meal - once to take our drink order, once to take our food order, and once to deliver our check.

I remember looking at it and thinking, ""Damn... That's a pretty nice sized 'mini' pizza."" But didn't think much of it then. It wasn't till we received the check that we realized they had charged us for a medium. We called over our waitress (who, btw, spent all her time gossiping and bitching to another waitress instead of taking care of her tables) and asked her if what we were eating was a ""mini"" sized pizza. She gave us one of those ""Are you kidding me?"" condescending looks, and replied ""You ordered a medium."" After politely explaining that we had wanted only a mini because we had ordered 2 other dishes as well, she called her manager over. He strutted over and scoffed at our concern, obviously thinking that we were trying to pull some trick to get some free food. He sneered at us, emphasizing that the sizes were on the menu and that it was ridiculous that we would think that their medium pizza was a mini. I explained that I had never been to that restaurant before and wasn't familiar with the sizes, and assumed that the waitress had given us the size we had asked for to begin with. AND that the sizes were not on the menu. And if I'm mistaken and they were, they may not have been in a place noticeable enough. Anyway, point being.... The service was awful and the manager a complete jerk. He eventually gave us the pizza for the price of the mini - But made it a point to scoff in our faces about it. The food wasn't bad. In fact, I'd give it a 3.5 star rating if it wasn't for the unpleasant experience cause by the management. No matter who's right or wrong in the situation, nobody managing a business should handle any situation in such an immature and disrespectful manner. Anyway, check it out if you're in the area and are in dire need of some pizza. The nachos aren't worth the price.

Wish they would expand their regular beer menu just a tad (I remember trying some of their seasonal selections and they were excellent; there need to be more of these!!!). My friend always gets the mac 'n cheese ($5 and it's loaded with cheese and bacon!); I love that you can make most things vegetarian on their menu and the servers don't get huffy over substitutions. I've tried a few of their sandwiches, pizzas (FLATBREADS!), and a pasta or two and haven't been disappointed; they've been consistent with flavor, presentation, and quality.

We and our neighboring table had to get up and switch tables too. Obviously, we lost our appetites and our waiter was very apologetic. The manager initially came out and insisted we pay for our meals with the exception of our appetizer as an apologetic gesture on behalf of BJ's restaurant. Management states ""the unexpected guest came from outside and we cannot control that."" After a moment of surprised silence, we communicated that to management that we believed it was wrong of her to ask us to pay.  Management frowned at us and then said ""well, I can't take off alcohol because of state law. I am going to have to explain this."" Obviously, the situation and manager's firm stance left the both of us with a bad taste in our mouths. We still gave a generous tip to our waiter who was very kind and apologetic.

Kira P.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,79,187,2.0,11/22/2012,"Every time someone asks me what is good at BJ's I always exclaim, 'I love their stuffed potatoes!'. Unfortunately, when our party of 5 arrived at BJ's in Westwood on Thanksgiving Eve, we were told they were out of ALL potatoes. We decided to start off with 2 orders of the Fried Artichokes (because one is never enough).  They told us that they were out but were making more.  With only a 7 minute wait for more we said we could wait. They came out fresh and delicious.   My bf ordered the soup and salad.  The soup looked and smelled amazing but we had to ask what kind of soup is this?  The guy who brought it told us it was tortilla soup.  So we sent it back since he had ordered chicken noodle and that's what he was in the mood for.  Turns out he wasn't too impressed with the chicken noodle and regrets sending the tortilla back since that one seemed like it would have tasted better.  His salad was served frozen, so we sent it back too.  The one they brought right back to him was much better.  This also allowed the server a little extra time to bring out the second dressing he had requested when we had initially place our order.   My dad ordered the fish and chips.  The fish was white and fluffy and the breading was crispy.   My step mom ordered the pulled pork sandwich which also had onion strings on it.  It was huge and Delicious! My sister ordered a burger.  It was huge and she said it was juicy.  She is a growing 17 year old 5'9"" softball player and she was only able to finish her fries and 1/2 the burger.   I ended up ordering the mahi mahi tacos grilled.  The seasoning was a bit bland and the fish was sort of dry.  Probably should have gone with one of their signature dishes and left the tacos for a Mexican Restaurant but that's my fault. We also ordered two pizookies for desert.  The triple chocolate and the original.  I was against ordering the triple because I thought it would be too much chocolate.  Surprisingly it was really good.  Yes it was chocolaty but not too much.  And the original was just as yummy as its always been!  Everyone at the table agreed that choosing to order the pizookie at the table was a MUCH better idea than standing in the cold out side, in the block and a 1/2 line that was forming outside of Diddy Reese. As we left the manager gave us a genuine 'have an amazing night' and 'Happy Thanksgiving'.   All in all I would give this restaurant another try.  I still need to fill my stuffed potato craving anyway ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=140

Alex E.,"Encino, CA",216,62,122,5.0,7/5/2014,"I went here on the fourth of July and I love this place. Being that it was a holiday, it was not crowded at all so we got seated right away, which from what I understand is usually not the case. At the same time, they seemed to be short staffed because the service was slow, but I understand since it's Independence Day. I ordered a deep dish pizza and they accidentally brought out a thin crust. They replaced it with the thick crust without a charge, which was very nice. The great part was that I was able to try both. I certainly recommend the deep dish. The thin crust tastes like any old pizza but the deep dish is to die for. We got a large size so I had some left over that I ate the next day. We also had the angel hair pasta with marinara sauce and it was delicious too. It came with some garlic bread which was really good too. But the best part was the dessert. If you go here, save room for a pizzookie, which is a pizza/cookie dessert. It has a nice warm cookie crust with ice cream on top. I think it is rated one of the best desserts in LA. This and Didi Reese across the street are amazing. We had the triple chocolate pizzokie, and if you like chocolate, you will love this one. It has a rich chocolate cookie that is unbelievable without being too rich. And to top it off it comes with double chocolate ice cream, which is chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips. I would go back in a heartbeat just for the dessert. The ambiance is great with lots of big screen TVs showing sports so it's a great place to watch a game if you like sports. Parking is difficult since it is in Westwood. There is no valet parking and the meters are usually full. We parked in the lot across the street, which was $ 6.50. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a place to hang out with friends and have some great pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=140

I recently discovered that their beer menu includes not only sampler flights, but also individual 5 oz glasses - perfect for a lightweight DD. The berry cider is pretty watery but I thought it was okay. MM and I share the small bbq chicken pizza in their iconic deepdish style with the crunchy crusty bottom and fluffy middle, topped with barbecue sauce, chicken cubes, fresh tomato, red onion, and cheese. Yum! I wouldn't stray off the pizza menu... the pastas are very meh and some of the other items are just bad. And eat it there - those pizzas just aren't the same when you bring it home as take-out. Sharing a small pizza between the two of us leaves plenty of room for a mini pizookie for dessert! I like it simple - chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla ice cream.

Otherwise service was exceptional - waters always filled, food came fast.  This was during the busy lunch rush.  The pizza/salad lunch deal for $6.50 cannot be beat.

Jenn H.,"New York, NY",426,102,167,1.0,5/28/2013,"When I began working as an event coordinator at a neighboring university, colleagues suggested that BJ's Westwood always offered good catering service and food. Admittedly, my experience was pleasant for the first few times of communicating with the staff at BJ's.  Unfortunately, during our most recent luncheon, BJ's demonstrated the most unprofessional and disrespectful service. Here is a narration of the utterly infuriating experience.  On May 3, 2012, I placed an order on the phone with a BJ's staff, requesting a Friend's & Family meal for the following Monday. Usually, communicating with the staff at BJ's is fairly straightforward. Perhaps the person on the phone was having a rough day--he took a while to fully comprehend the order I'd like to place.  On the day of the luncheon (May 6, 2012), I received a call from BJ's around 40 min before the delivery time, asking me to place an order for another salad, for that the one I had originally ordered wasn't available. I hastily chose a salad and went to the conference room to prepare for the meeting. After much anticipation, the order was delivered around 12:10pm, which was a 25 min delay. Also, I noticed that the order was significantly smaller than what we have had before. Upon checking the receipt, all of the items were listed as ""Balsamic Chicken"", which hindered me from validating if we had gotten the correct order. As the delivery person left, we realized that plates and utensils were missing. Naturally, frustration grew in the conference room, as we have all been looking forward to eat lunch.  After 15 minutes of requesting plates to be delivered, we received them and everyone gobbled down the food. When the meeting was over, my boss informed me that BJ's had forgotten 2 large orders of salads, which were delivered 50 minutes later to the wrong location that happened to be the Chairman's office.  I called to ask to speak with a manager multiple times regarding the multiple mistakes that had occurred. During each phone call, I was either put on hold for a prolonged period of time, which led me to eventually ending the call, or that I was sent to speak with a manager who claimed to have no power to issue any monetary resolution for my case. Livid and insulted, I was discouraged to contact BJ's again.  Until last week, as I was walking by the eatery, I decided to step in and ask for the manager. When speaking with the manager, I was told that late deliveries were normal occurrences, suggesting that I should not have been dissatisfied because of the late order. I was baffled--What is the point of specifying a delivery time if it is meant to be delayed? Such poor work ethics is unheard of in my career.  Noticing the manager's nonchalance about my complaint, I proceeded to list the mistakes that BJ's had committed within one catering order. He then told me that the delivery person was faced with ""a door slammed in his face"" when he attempted to deliver the missing salads 50 minutes later. I was in the conference room during the luncheon, and I honestly did not witness such rudeness being performed. Bewildered by the manager's attitude, I recounted the importance of customer relations and asked for the manager's resolution. Ultimately, he offered two BJ's gift cards, which I gave to my boss when I returned to the office.  I do not dine at BJ's because of the greasy foods and large portions. After this series of flippant customer service, my personal preference has been reinforced. In addition, I do not recommend BJ's catering service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=140
Lillian Q.,"Chino Hills, CA",21,99,30,1.0,3/3/2014,BJ's is a chain restaurant so the food is pretty much the same elsewhere. However the service was crap. My friend was the birthday girl and made a reservation for 8. I was coming half an hour late so I told them to order before me. I arrive and sit down at our table. At first I waited patiently for the waitress to come to our table so that I could order something small to eat and a drink for the birthday girl. Not once did she come to our table or give me the slightest notice. Then I tried to flag her down but she did not seem to have noticed me waving my hands like crazy.  So let me retract my star. She gets NO STAR for NO SERVICE.  She finally came to our table half an hour later to give us the bill. I had not ordered a single thing. I don't understand how this restaurant functions.

I don't think I've ever had such an odd service experience as I did last night, I'm still thinking about it.  My friend and I popped into BJs in Westwood after seeing a movie nearby.  Our waitress Marissa seemed weird to begin with but whatever.  But then, we experienced firsthand that her service was also weird.  Important to note is that the waiter station where the waiters put their orders into the computer was literally three feet from our booth.   Marissa delivered our food and stepped aside the couple of feet over to the waiter station to do something on the computer.  In the same moment that she delivered our food, we realized that she had never brought us any place settings/utensils, so we could not eat our food.  As mentioned, we noticed this pretty much right when she brought us our food but she had slid behind the waiter station before asking if we needed anything else/before we had the chance to tell her we needed something else.  We immediately said ""excuse me"" noting that we needed something right away before we could start eating, however, Marissa continued looking at her computer and told us to ""hold on.""  So we sat there for several seconds unable to eat our food until another server asked what we needed and got us utensils. The next major weird incident was when we went to pay.  Marissa brought us our bill and my friend put her credit card in with our check and handed it to Marissa -- forgetting to get my credit card so we could split it.  Marissa turned to her computer to run the credit card but, just then, before she even started, I handed her my card and asked her to please split the bill.  Marissa (again with keeping her eyes on the computer and refusing to give me eye contact) said, ""Sorry, I just use the first card that is given to me and REFUSED to take my card - I was really confused by this.  My friend ended up paying for our whole meal since Marissa wouldn't LET ME split it with her.  We mentioned these odd occurrences to the manager and he was pretty apathetic about it.  Weird and safe to say I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=140
Winnie L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",1015,858,39828,4.0,4/11/2009,"I'll let the voted-Funniest Anh make the dirty jokes about BJ's.  If you like deep-dish Chicago pizza, you might prefer to go to another franchise to avoid the college kids, whether they be Bruins looking for an alternative to dorm food or Trojans who infiltrate Bruintown and wearing their cardinal and gold.   On this particular Good Friday, there were many collegiate sports teams wearing their team jackets and digging into great pizza.  There is always a wait for BJ's, but not all was lost when a waitress pulled a C&O's and offered us generous slices of cheese and tomato pizza while we were curbside    (for those of you unfamiliar with C&O's, they offer garlic rolls gratis to patrons waiting for a table in the cold) We were served by a Korean guy named Richard on paper but called himself Jin.  He's the new Ed at this BJ's.   We had a medium Vegetarian pizza, spotted with tomatoes, black olives, mushroom, bell peppers and onions. The mozzarella cheese sticks, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, are served with marinara sauce but you can ask for Ranch if you like BJ's Favorite is the vegetarian + meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage pizza.  The Buffalo Chicken pizza is like buffalo chicken on pizza.  Such a simple yet ingenious idea.  Tasty too.    Strawberry lemonades were super cool here back in the early 2000's before other restaurant chains started offering them so skip them and order the BJ's Sampler:     Be prepared to get tipsy. If this is your first time, save some room for the Cookies 'n Cream Pizookie (like a cookie in a pan with ice cream on top).  Old-timers can save their money by going across the street for some Diddy Reese ice cream sandwiches for dessert.

I saw that the Yelp reviews were pretty lackluster, but I chalked it up to people not liking chain restaurants and went anyway. Unfortunately, it was a complete disappointment and I won't be coming here again. I know their food is supposed to be better than this! The biggest issue was the very ""meh"" food. Two of the pasta dishes ordered in our group were completely flavorless and dry. Mine in particular - the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta - was supposed to have a creamy Chardonnay wine sauce. There WAS sauce in my pasta, but it was surrounded by a huge ring of sauceless pasta. Even when I tossed it all together, the pasta was just barely wet with very bland sauce. The strawberry lemonade was also overpoweringly sweet. I love my sweet drinks and especially strawberry lemonade (I will down the stuff at Red Robin!) but this was terrible. I made it through halfway before asking for an extra cup of ice to water it down with. I ended up pouring ALL of the extra ice in to dilute half a cup of lemonade, and even then it was too strong. We also ordered three pizookies for the table and one of them came out with a minimal amount of ice cream, most of which was melted all over the cookie (which means it must have been standing around longer than the rest, which had more ice cream and were not as melted). They also brought out the wrong drink and the wrong food order, although they immediately rectified it as soon as we pointed it out to them. Not a big deal, but it just added up to a lot of bad things. Nitpicky things aside, it was the ridiculously bland pasta that ensures me that I will never return to this BJ's again. I will give other locations a try before I give up on this chain entirely though - I still have hope! Pros- Call ahead seating means we were seated immediately at 7:00pm on a weekday evening, exciting menu, $5 parking lot across the street since Westwood parking is a nightmare Cons- Flavorless/bland pasta, strawberry lemonade too sweet",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=320

Meredith D.,"Larchmont, NY",32,68,,4.0,8/23/2009,"I'm a fan of any restaurant that can take all my loves of bad for you food like hamburgers, pizzas and decadent desserts and combine them in one large menu. BJ's of course is that place with tons of things to order and a different take on each. With a full drink menu, including quite an impressive list of wines given that BJ's is kind of like an Applebee's or Cheesecake factory (aka. Chains), a concoction of liquor filled drinks and of course beers (to compliment the sports playing on the flat screen TVs) you'll never go thirsty here. Add to this their extensive menu of pages upon pages of different appetizers, salads, soups, pizza's and of course hamburgers. Their pizzas are classic Chicago deep dish style and while I'm not sure I can speak with any authority on classic Chicago deep dish pizzas I found these to be rich and yummy. The crust and dough almost melted in my mouth along with the cheese (which was a little too salty for my taste and where they lost that desired last star) and tomato sauce. Their wedge french fries are large, in charge and perfectly seasoned to make you want to keep eating even when your stomach may scream to stop. And speaking of stomach's talking, yours should most certainly ask for the pizookie dessert, a trademark of the BJ's franchise. With a huge recently cooked cookie (of the chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, oreo or peanut butter variety--your choice) ice cream and flavorful adds on on the very top you'll be in sweet heaven, literally. So save room because this dessert is huge, meant to be shared but definitely fulfilling after only a few bites.

During my visit, I ordered a classic and mediterranean pizza. Food: The pizza itself was pretty good, but I don't feel that it was exceptional in taste. The restaurant seemed to try too hard with the mediterranean pizza, piling on tons of toppings.  Price: The price is a little more on the expensive side. I was not entirely satisfied with the price-pizza size ratio. In comparison to other pizza joints, BJs is very pricey...Although one can easily write it off to the fact BJs is a ""gourmet pizza shop.""

Matthew P.,"Manhattan, NY",69,47,16,4.0,2/13/2009,"I don't consider myself a restaurant snob, and I am certainly no foodie, but for some reason I was hell bent on avoiding this place.   I was picturing a glorified TGI Fridays or Garfields (aw, remember Garfields?), filled with undergrads whose proximity to the place made it seem more appealing than it actually was.   I think the main reason for my apprehension was that I remember the restaurant/bars  in my college town and the excitement of Being-An-Adult-at-a-Restaurant-Unaccompanied.  That was fun at 18, but it's a high that wears off pretty fast.  Which is to say, the fun of ""yay, no parents!"" has turned into ""shouldn't someone be looking after those kids?""  Turns out, BJs is pretty much exactly what I expected, crowd-wise, but it was still kind of awesome.   They've got an extensive beer menu, not too expensive.  Not a lot of vegan options, but first of all: - what self respecting vegan would allow themselves to be dragged here, anyway? and second of all,  - the greasy-delicious seasoned fries were plenty serviceable at taking the edge off a couple especially flavorful pints of stout on an empty stomach. The waitress was sweet and pretty and friendly (and I am a sucker for good service.) Actually, every customer at every table almost without exception was fresh-faced and wholesome-hot.  It was like a sports bar in Desperate Housewives.  Thanks, Los Angeles!! I'm not sure I'd go back -- I'm just not really a beer and fries kind of guy, and Native Foods is right around the corner -- but I will happily admit that, while my impression of this place was pretty much dead-on -- it's a sports bar with a lot of undergrads -- I was wrong about it.  It made for a fun evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=320
Toni L.,"Los Angeles, CA",907,873,3488,3.0,9/15/2007,"This place saved me from starvation so many times with their delivery pizza. It's a BJ's like any other so I don't know how useful this review is going to be for you. I'll give it a shot anyway.  Food: The pizzas are expensive but utterly satisfying. The BBQ is an obvious choice, especially with all those carmelized onions on top. There's also an alfredo pizza. I think I'm the only person I know who actually likes this, but if you are a fan of alfredo or white sauce, this is an interesting variation. As for the pasta, I'd recommend the cajun and the grilled chicken for the less adventurous. Same goes for the sandwiches. Just order anything BBQ or cajun and you'll be golden. Dessert? Pizookie of course! Atmosphere: Not as loud as other BJs I've been to. There's a small seating area upstairs which is a nice place to study if you're lucky enough to be escorted there.  Service: They'll often tell you there's a wait like they're trying to make it seem busier than it actually is. I've really never had to wait to get in here though.

Megan S.,"Santa Monica, CA",61,286,,3.0,2/27/2009,"Oh lordy.  My grad school program takes people here for recruiting, so every September thru March, I eat here once a month.  It's a great place to go with a big group, with decent service and a good selection of food and beer.  After eating here literally dozens of times, here's a rundown: 1. Full meal must include (no more and no less) appetizers, pizza, and beer.  And Pizookie for dessert.  Don't waste your stomach space with salads or pastas or random salmon entrees--the pizza here is so massive you need to save room! 2. Order avocado eggrolls.  They are amazing: fried, and avocado--the best things in life.  3. In fact, you should get at least 2 orders of avocado eggrolls.  They really are good. 4. Best pizza flavors: Barbecue chicken and BJ's favorite.  Worst flavors: Buffalo chicken and Mediterranean (the toppings feel too ""light"" for the pizza). 5. Best pizookie flavor: OREO.  If you like cookies and cream ice cream, you will never want to eat anything else. 6. The beers are pretty much all good.  A handy beer sampler is available on the menu! 7. Ok fine, you wanted a salad? The BBQ chicken chopped salad is excellent. I've always been in groups of 20+, and the wait staff has generally been great with getting our orders right, bringing drinks, and changing the TV channels so we can watch our favorite sports teams.  The food is ridiculously heavy and greasy, so eating here will definitely be a caloric splurge.  The pizza claims to be Chicago style, but it's more like a generic deep dish, with generous toppings, not too much sauce, and a nice chewy crust that's crispy around the edges.  I might have given this place 4 stars, except that I always feel slightly ill after eating here (probably because I have no self control).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=320

But you can walk around while you wait because they give you one of those buzzer things that buzz when your table's ready. I had the BBQ beef sandwich while my friend had a stuffed potato. I really like the potato wedges here and that was probably my favorite part of the meal. The BBQ was full of BBQ sauce but in the end, it was just alright. My friend's stuffed potato looked amazing but then once you start eating, all the stuffing is at the top, and once you've eaten the cheesey topping on the top, what's left is a baked potato that hasn't got much else to it.

BUT...since an ex-coworker came to visit and she hasn't been at BJ's for quite awhile, I figured, why not.  Location wise...well it's in Westwood, so there's a lot of traffic from the folks at UCLA, ahem, like myself.  So it's busy, especially during lunch time.  Parking wise, there's a structure down the street on Broxton so no worries on that.  The restaurant is a good size and there's an upstairs seating level.  And the food...well it was ok.  Not bad or fantastic.  I ordered the lunch special - salad & chicken Alfredo flat bread pizza.  The good thing is that it's just the perfect portion without feeling like you overstuffed yourself (i.e. Korean BBQ).  Salad was kind of bland, but at least it wasn't over dressed.  I also tried a piece of my co-worker's chicken tenders - which I admit was pretty yummy and freshly fried. but was everything worth 500 or so calories? eh, i rather splurge on some of Santana's carne asada fries in SD (or something along those lines).  but at least our waitress was pleasant, so that was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=420

The feeling makes things fun, you just want to get up and dance, people are yelling and laughing, television screens are a bit loud, just happy. I was thinking to myself, oh, now this can't be that bad I WAS DANG WRONG Part 2: The food I ordered two dishes, one was the usual deep dish pizza, and potato skins. Potato Skins: This chef has to be the most lazy guy on EArth. These were deep fried quartered potatoees, hollowed a bit to be ""skins"" They had this really bad ranch sauce in the middle, that had to be from Vons or something like that, and then they dumped so shredded cheese on there.  They didn't even bother to melt the cheese, how lazy can you get? Just fling the thing into the broiler for a bit, then take it out THAT'S SO DANG EASY. That is literally the most simple rule in cooking.... MELT YOUR CHEESE. This was lazy, and honestly, pretty nasty. Deep Dish Pizza: Crust was not that bad, i admit it wasn't that bad, but the rest was sloppily made. Too much sauce caused everything to slip off like a dead salamander on a log, which is extremely unappetizing. It was okay, but not good enough to be a signature dish Part 3 Conclusion Alin all, a very bad restaurant..

dawson s.,"Los Angeles, CA",2015,386,616,2.0,7/29/2006,"I'm sorry to say this was mediocre at best ..   We ducked in today for lunch after snooping around at Secret Stash because The Beer recalled having some sort of orgasmic dessert experience at another one of their locations. We were seated at one of the few tables upstairs (which was awkward but all that was available) and ordered the Avocado Egg Roll appetizer. Despite the sauce being too sweet (even for me) they were very yummy (but then, I'm of the mind that you could deep fry a leather shoe and it would be good). They were a lot like the ones at Cheesecake Factory, but with the addition of bacon (I'm also of the mind that everything is better with bacon). He ordered the Roast Beef Dip and I had the BBQ Chicken Salad. After a long wait for the egg rolls, the main courses were up (literally and figuratively), and our server rushed us thru them so she could clear the plate and make room on the table. He said the roast beef was bland and rubbery and the roll was soggy on the inside and over crisped on the outside. The battered fries and horseradish creme were much better, but not enough to salvage the meal. As for my salad, had there actually been any bbq chicken in it, it might have been great. It was mostly chopped iceberg lettuce with a few kernels of corn, some black beans, jicama, tomatoes, and a few chunks of bland grilled chicken. Had they tossed half the lettuce, added more of the remaining ingredients and actually included some BBQ chicken, it would have been a worthy meal of a salad.   Food aside, we both had the Blonde brew which wasn't bad on a warm day if you're in the mood for a pale ale. Sadly, we were so bummed with our food and service, we passed on their signature Pizookie dessert (a giant deep dish baked cookie topped with ice cream).

They have big booths that can accommodate several people. 4. You can park in the lot on Broxton and walk there, eat, and return to your car in under two hours so parking is free. 5.

Lunch deal, salad and half a sandwich for under $10 was great.  I had so much food I could hardly move after lunch. Bad review for the service though.  Maybe our waitress was having a bad day and the host had a stick up his bum but last time I checked people should smile when they work in food service. We had to have waited almost 20 minutes to order anything.  Then we got to sit and watch our food wait for us on the line while the waitress played over by the computers talking to the other staff while they also let their food get cold.

It's cool because you can order everything in halves so you can try a bunch of different flavors. The nice thing about the Oreo pizzookie is that it comes with oreo mousse on top (a sort of glorified whip cream). That was pretty darn tasty.

The beer selection here is good.  More importantly, it is brewed on sight.  You can get a sampler if you want to try everything, but my personal favorite is the Nutty Brewnette. The deep dish pizza here is good.  It's not going to make you forget about your recent trip to Zachary's up north or your favorite Chicago pizza place, but you'll be happy with it.  The appetizers are pretty standard fare - all good, but value for dollar you are better off sharing a pizza and salad.  If you want a salad for a meal, again they are pretty standard, but made well and flavorful. One thing to note about this particular location - I have never had a Pizookie at this BJs (although I have had them at other BJs, and they are very good).  Why?  Because Diddy friggin' Riese is right across the street.  For just $1.50 you can get a killer, home-made ice cream sandwich.  Trust me on this, save a few bucks and walk across the street.

Swati V.,"San Jose, CA",290,72,49,4.0,2/8/2014,"Most of these reviews are about the pizza at BJs but I think the best part about this place is the beer and the burgers. First of all, I'm vegetarian and I must say that the BJs veggie patty is my favorite substitute veggie patty out of all the places I've tried. Island's is a close second, but this still takes the cake for me. The crispy jalapeño burger is by far my favorite, mostly because of the crispy jalapeños inside (i love anything fried) and also because the veggie patty doesn't taste like a lump of potatoes. I also found one of my favorite beers here, the PM porter. It's so creamy and chocolatey perfectly bitter. For Guinness lovers, it's almost like a creamy guinness double stout, or a sweeter oatmeal stout. If you're feeling something a little fruitier, the Black Velvet at BJs is also amazing. It's a berry cider mixed with the PM porter and it tastes like a dark chocolate cake with a tart raspberry dressing. Writing about it makes me want to go get one right now! The lighter beers are pretty good too (i'm not a huge fan of the amber and red ales), but I'd recommend the Blonde as well if you aren't a dark beer person.  Crispy jalapeño burger with fries and ranch on the side + a black velvet = the perfect meal.

Finally came hear maybe after a year of not going for personal reasons. Anyways came with my coworker and they immediately sat us down. First thing I noticed was we were given paper napkins, looked around and did see some tables had the traditional cloth ones and others had paper. Has BJ's experienced some economic problems? Also no utensils? What, had to asked after the meal came, strangely enough they gave me spaghetti, with a spoon? I'm not Italian, even though in Italy I may look like one, but I never heard of eating spaghetti with a spoon. Spagettii was ok, meat sauce good, though not too special. I also had the chili which I used to love, but something changed or maybe my taste buds changed, but it was just not very good and just seemed to come out of a can. Bad batch who knows.

Our first courses and mains came out within 30 seconds of eachother, and when you're eating with another person at a two person table, all of the sudden you're drowning in plates/spoons/glasses/etc. The waiter seemed a little insensitive to the fact we needed to get out in a hurry (we had an hour for lunch and needed to get back to work).

Jason K.,"Lomita, CA",103,525,101,4.0,6/7/2010,"I've been to a number of different BJ's locations and they are all very consistent.  The Chicago style pizza is thick, filling, very good, loaded with toppings (of which there are a large variety to choose from), and pretty authentic in nature.  The prices are a bit high, but they provide good quality ingredients and taste for that price. I have gotten the classic calzone (which is very filling), the shrimp tacos (a less caloric options with some good flavor), the breaded chicken sandwich (simple and well executed), the shrimp in a white wine alfredo sauce (decent), and the pizookies (hehe) in the past as well.  They now provide all of the nutritional information for each menu item at the back of the menu for you to peruse what will be your undoing before making a choice. One of my favorite things about BJ's besides the pizza, though, is the selection of beers they offer.  They have a wide variety of bottle beers (some of which are pretty rare Belgians and such) at great prices.  Additionally, they have around 8-10 BJ's brewed beers on tap, of which many are excellent.  My wife and I really like the blonde.  She likes the Nutty Brewnette and the Jeremiah red as well.  I like the Porter and especially the Tatonka Imperial Stout.  All of these are like $5-$6 for a glass.  Good stuff!  If you like ciders, they have a great berry cider as well. The Westwood location is a bit small, which is kind of a bummer during dinner time on a Friday or Saturday night, so try to call in a res if you can, or at least come put your name in, then wander the village for a while till the table is ready. Summary: Great Chicago deep-dish.  Great beer selection.  Other menu items are good and range depending on what you like.  Overall, prices are fair.  Finish with Pizookie or Diddy Riese for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=200

The potato wasn't the most awesome thing on earth.  Which is sad thing, I think.  It had all the elements necessary for fantastic salty engorgement: potato + cheeeeeeeese.  I kind of shrugged the whole thing off as.... a-ok.  Not godawful but it didn't seem like I was having a revelation either.

Sienna K.,"Philadelphia, PA",105,153,21,4.0,5/31/2008,"Me: Hi. Can you seat us somewhere with the view of the upcoming Lakers game?  Hostess: Oh, don't worry. If I have any say in this, every television will be turned onto the Lakers game. Come on now, it's the LAKERS.  ...It's so good to be home.  *** My friends and I were visiting a friend of ours at UCLA, and we chose here so we could 1) be in Westwood 2) eat something other than greasy bar food 3) watch the Game 4 of the Western Conference Championships.  And while I wouldn't eat here if it weren't for the exact combination of the three reasons listed above, I have to admit that eating here wasn't as painful as I'd imagined, and actually did enjoy my time here.  I mean, it's a BJ's-- it's like the TGIFs of pizzas with a funnier name.   You've probably already been to a BJ's and don't need my words telling you how the pizza tastes (satisfyingly mediocre; insulting if you're a pizza purist, damn good if you're pizza ignorant, and simply edible if you're somewhere in between). The salads and pastas tastes exactly like every other salad/pasta at every other chain restaurant.  The only thing really note-worthy about the chain is that they have their signature beers, which aren't so bad considering the prices. As someone who ordered the Piranha (hoppy American pale ale), there are better and worse beers out there, but it's at least worth a drink. But do skip out on the ciders, unless you enjoy ciders that taste like Smirnoff Ice.  Anyways, here are the Westwood location specific notes:  -No bar (though they still serve alcohol) -Mixed drinks (hey, my friend ordered it, not me!) named after UCLA and USC (Seriously, is this what the great SoCal rivalry has turned into? The Bruin-ita versus the Trojan-tini?) -A much younger crowd (Duh. Right around campus) -Super awesome staff that was patient with us even though we finished our food by the first quarter -Kinda disgusting bathrooms with no toilet paper  So... it's like a 3 star place, but the one extra star is because the Lakers won the game and are going to the Finals. But seriously, as someone who is more used to getting snide comments whenever she shouts ""MVP"" during a Lakers game, I really loved the fact that every TV was turned onto the game, so many people were decked out in yellow and purple, and that even the waiters would stop and stare whenever Kobe made his beautiful fade aways. It makes me sad that I won't be in LA for the Finals... though... I am sort of excited at the prospects of trash talking with the Boston folks in New York. Bring it on, Massholes.

Daniel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,82,,3.0,2/14/2011,"I just got a Yelp account and I couldn't believe that this place only had three stars. This is my favorite place to eat. Period. Nothing else even comes close. I have been here over 50 times in my life, on occasions ranging from my birthday (three times), to dates with my girlfriend, to celebrate my college acceptance, and EVERY single time, I have been greeted with great food and exceptional service. Just for the sake of informing others, I will note a few of the more testing situations and how they were resolved.  Once, for my birthday, I came with a part of 10. We called ahead for a table and they said that it would be about one hour. We arrived in an hour, yet we still waited about 20 minutes to get seated. This was frustrating, yet understandable because we were a large party and the location is very small. Another time, my family and I placed our order and waited for about 20 minutes. The food arrived, but my pizza had not yet arrived. The MANAGER OF THE STORE then came out to tell me that they messed up with my pizza and that I would be getting it in 10 minutes (not a long wait..). Oh, and he gave it to us on the house! The line can be long, so call ahead! It is a great BJs location in a cute part of Los Angeles. My favorite 3-course meal here is the chicken wings, the Blackened Chicken Pizza, and the chocolate chip pizookie. It is very unhealthy, but SO good! Go to this BJs, and you won't regret it as long as you call ahead. EDIT: Sadly, I have decided to drop two stars from my rating, because, over the previous year, this BJ's has deteriorated into a place that I can no longer recognize. First off, they redid the interior so that there are now only two lengthy booths - the others only seat four people comfortably.  Secondly, they changed the recipe of the pizza, so that the tasteless, bland, crust now takes up LITERALLY half of the slice. What used to be my favorite pizza is now one of my absolutely least favorite. Please, BJ's, change the recipe back. This new one is AWFUL compared to the old one.  The previous three visits have been so poor (every time) that I am likely not going to return for some time.

Sydnee S.,"Sacramento, CA",32,23,3,5.0,6/3/2011,"my roommates and i ordered pizza on two separate delivery orders in the same night, and BOTH times the delivery guy forgot our ranch dressing. i know this seems like an extremely minor detail, but i think we can all agree that ranch dressing is clutch for BJs pizza. We excused the first mistake, but after we realized the same delivery guy forgot our ranch dressing on not one, but TWO orders, in THE SAME night, we had to call back. So we called back. We spoke to the hostess and the manager about the situation. BOTH were super cool about the situation...especially the hostess ( i think her name is Michelle). They ended up sending the delivery guy back with 6 ramekins of ranch. Although this was a nice gesture from BJs management, when the delivery guy came back, he KICKED  our door and then basically threw the ranch ramekins in our faces without saying a word or making eye contact. It was extremely disrespectful. I wish I would have caught his name. So we called back...again. We spoke to the manager (John), again, and he was SO AWESOME. He was extremely apologetic and understanding about the entire situation, and even after I explained we wanted nothing out of it, he demanded we give him our address so he could send us a gift card to make up for it. The take-away: I am really impressed with the way the general management handled the situation. He totally turned the entire situation around. He is the ONLY reason I will ever give this BJs service ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-westwood?start=360

They have really good, deep dish (don't giggle at that) pizzas and their pizooki is AMAZING. A big ol' warm cookie straight from the oven with ice cream on top? Simple, but brilliant idea. They are also big on the beer scene (hence the brewhouse in the name) and even do a beer sampler. Now it's story time: my brother and I came here for dinner a short time after he had turned 21. He was very excited to order booze, but sadly, our waitress didn't card him. I had convinced him to do the beer sampler under the guise that as a new ""legal drinker"", he would need to know his beer.  Like a champ, he downed those little shot glasses and was halfway through his sampler before our pizza had arrived. So let's not lie: the kid was drunk. And it was amazing. He started yelling (he thought he was talking at a normal volume), threw his credit card at our waitress when the bill came and nearly fell down the stairs as we were leaving (we were seated on the second floor). In his haste, he left his credit card (and unsigned bill) behind and our waitress had to literally chase him down the street.

Add icecream and you get dessert. :) As for the pizookie or brownie - they are both good, but I always find it way too sweet. Everything else I've tried was very mediocre, if not bad.
