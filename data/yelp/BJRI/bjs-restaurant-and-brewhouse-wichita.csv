Lee V.,"Lake Stevens, WA",0,32,31,5.0,12/9/2017,"By far our favorite place to eat! The menu can be rather overwhelming, considering it's the size of a textbook, but there's something for everyone! Service was outstanding! People were friendly & staff was accommodating! Kid friendly & all around, simply fantastic! We had the trio dessert, Slow Roasted Turkey sandwich, Deep Dish Zutisi, kids burger & fries, and kids spaghetti. Right after we ordered, our waiter brought over some bread and small fruit bowl for the kids while their meal was being prepared. Always a pleasant experience at BJs! Love this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita
Roxanne R.,"Wichita, KS",106,10,3,5.0,1/11/2018,BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants! The food is delicious and the beer selection is excellent! Friendly service.

The crusted chicken Parmesan is my favorite dish!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita
Ray N.,"Tulsa, OK",152,325,517,4.0,6/7/2017,"I like this chain!  For casual dining it's really pretty good.  This location like the others I've been to is quite large, has a ton of staff and lots of places to sit in multiple 'area's if you will.   There's a nice bar section and other places to sit that can accommodate a large group or a booth for a slightly more intimate setting. The food here is pretty darn good too.  I've had their ginormous salads and have enjoyed a low cal bison burger and fried calamari.    the service here is great and the place is clean.    I'd recommend coming in here for sure!  Enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita
Angie H.,"Wichita, KS",21,101,89,4.0,5/29/2017,"This is one of my go-to places on the East side when I'm sticking to my diet because they have more than the normal amount of dishes I can eat.  I'm on a gluten, dairy, rice, soy, fun-free diet, so usually there's not much for me to choose from.  This place has a huge menu and a couple of quinoa dishes that are not only Angie diet-friendly, but really damn good!  the siracha brussel sprouts are also excellent! My hubby likes this place, too because he isn't locked into one kind of cuisine...they have a bit of everything. One major perk of this place is that they have house-made root beer and black cherry soda...totally to die for!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita
Sumayya V.,"Wichita, KS",1,6,10,3.0,6/11/2017,"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. They have a lot of choices on their menu and they even have a small selection of 'Light' entrees. I like that the place was pretty large so it doesn't get too crowded. The service was subpar. Our server never gave us silverware or napkins so that was disappointing.  The food was pretty good. I ordered the Barbacoa cauliflower tacos with fries.  Instead of the Greek yogurt creme, I asked for chipotle mayo dressing on my tacos and they ended up tasting delicious. The fries were ok, nothing different about them. I mainly ordered the tacos because they were served in flatbread instead of tortillas but part of the flatbread for both of the tacos that I got was burnt. The part of the tacos that weren't burnt was really good. I might come back and give them another try. I didn't get to try their famous pizookies so I'll have to come back to try those.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita

Chelsi U.,"Ladson, SC",159,224,411,4.0,6/9/2016,"The food was pretty good here. I had the balsamic chicken, which was not too bad. The only thing is they put a LOT of balsamic on the chicken. It was tasty until I wanted to eat the salad. We had the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, which was delicious!

We were seated quickly and had our drink orders taken but it seemed like forever before our waiter took our order. I decided on the mini buffalo chicken pizza with a caesar salad to start. The salad was pretty good and the rest of my family enjoyed their salads. The buffalo on the pizza was way too spicy in my opinion and that might just be a preference thing. The garlic knots my sister ordered are to die for. We ended with ordering the trio pizookies and they were amazing!! Definitely recommend getting the monkey bread one.

Vlad I.,"Chicago, IL",241,98,346,5.0,7/21/2014,"This is the one of the best brewery i've ever been in a long time . BJ's in Wichita,KS. Wowww what s place. They are offering over 12 local beers that they are crafting . I had a pleasure to have Harvest Hefeweizen ( wheat beer ) and Oasis (amber) and they are both freaking awesome! Food wise,there is so much stuff to order,i mean like everything,you name it they have it. I started w caesar salad. And let me tell you something....that salat was super-duper FRESH.You can tell when lettuce came this morning from the store not fridge .  They have a lot of pizza's to chose from,so i went with Mortadella/Mushrooms deep dish pizza . It was ok,not saying it was bad or nothing like that....but i live in Chicago (pizza town) so can't beat that. On the other side like a sad,this place is ROCKING!!! P.S.

Caitlyn S.,"San Antonio, TX",178,367,158,2.0,5/13/2014,"Oh BJ's. I don't even know where to start with this review. Which is how I feel every time I open up your menu. The options are endless. I mean, really. The menu is like, 36 pages. Now, that does mean that there is plenty of variety, and if you go with a large crowd there is sure to be something for everyone. That also means that there are plenty of vegetarian options, which always makes me like a restaurant just a little more. But it definitely does NOT appeal to my indecisive nature, or help with the nasty little habit I have of picking option B when I should always, always go with option A. Anyway, I don't think I've ever had anything bad here, so there's that.  But in order to save you the time and trouble to read a lengthy review (you'll need that time and energy to get through the menu), I'm going to make this short: Service is terrible and the prices are way too high.

Alexis R.,"Liberty, MO",429,590,695,4.0,8/5/2012,"While BJ's just opened about 2 weeks ago, they seem to have ironed out most of the issues that plagued this chain micro-brew in the early weeks.  We went for lunch in the first week and our meal took over an hour with slow service and kitchen staff.  Our order arrived incorrect with regular crust instead of whole wheat on our lunch-pizza specials ($7).  We didn't want to wait another hour so we just took what  we got.   The beers at lunch are $3.50 and while the IPA was quite muddy and lacking the typical crispness, the pale ale was pleasing. Returned for Happy Hour later in the week - 1/2 mini pizzas and -$1 off beers.  Thankfully they allowed us to get the specials in the main dining area.  There was nothing posted about HH only in the bar and we were a  bit confused when our server had to consult the manager to get us the deals in the dining room.  Anyways, it worked out and we enjoyed mini pizzas (usually ~10$) along with $3 dinner salads.  Not a lot of food for the price but the swanky inside, rich wood accents and extensive bar menu are a welcome addition. The Nit Wit wheat was a nice, citrusy, summer beer but my favorite was the Raspberry Cider!  Not too sweet, perfect crisp finish- definitely liked it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=20

I found no kale in this pile of romaine and dressing. There were some hard little Brussels sprouts and plenty of berries. When I asked the server if they were out of kale she went to ask. The cooks response was ""it's baby kale so you won't see it."" Really? Is it prenatal??? The manager stopped by and his explanation was even better.

Ettya F.,"Boston, MA",307,701,206,4.0,1/15/2013,"It's not as if BJ's doesn't exist in other parts of the country. It's not as if BJ's dishes out peculiar hamburgers stacked with horseradish, fontina cheese and pancetta. It's not as if equally huge pizzas cannot be purchased at that chain delivery service next to your house. So if BJ's is superficially normal...and just A-OK, then why proclaim fandom?  1) Because this is Kansas, which means acquiring Ahi Poke anywhere would be a feat. Poke, as Hawaii taught me, ought to be cubed, sauced and (if going for fancy) stacked atop some sort of avocado. Even if the Poke is probably frozen, it still tastes like raw tuna, and is NOT accompanied by stomach turns. (The fried wonton chips are a little weird, but that's just a matter of preference.) 2) Pizzokies - or however they're spelled - are infinitely mouthwateringly scrumptious. If a cookie is baked in a pan, has a gooey center and crisp edges, and you don't like this sort of glucose abomination then there's something terribly wrong with you. Topping said cookie (the red velvet rules like Cider House) with a scoop of ice cream that quicky melts over and under the baked good adds a creamy richness only adding to the glorious insulin rush, to be cured by the drop in blood sugar caused by #3... 3) Monday All Day Drink Specials. Those $5 Mojitos and Martinis will get you buzzed like a fly...and unlike most chain restaurants, there's nothing cloying and hangover inducing about these light-on-the-simple-syrup, heavy-on-the-actual-ingredients drinks - case in point, you can actually taste the essence of the muddled mint in the regular mojito.

But, one of our friends had the Southern Fried Chicken which is probably what we will end up ordering next time instead of the pork chops.

Brad S.,"Wichita, KS",357,1386,637,3.0,9/25/2013,"Fine. You win, BJ's. For a year I've avoided checking out the giant structure on the corner of two of the busiest streets in town, partially due to the reports of bad service (brought on by the gobsmackingly large number of people who crowd the place) and partially on account of my personal policy against reviewing chains whenever practical. But it was Saturday dinner time and I was looking for something substantial after dodging crowds in the mall, so there went that. For a ""brewhouse"" (they start brewing the beer in a central facility and send it to the restaurant to be finished), the beer was average. Of the four I sampled, three (Jeremiah Red, Nutty Brewnette, and P.M. Porter) were pretty harsh from the alcohol content. Why does a red or porter need to be brewed to 7.3 and 6.4% ABV, respectively? Take it down a notch, guys. The fourth, Tatonka Russian imperial stout, made use of its high alcohol content, but the roasty chocolate-y flavors weren't as developed as they could have been. I guess it's neat they brew so many styles you wouldn't normally find at a place like this, such as a Grand Cru or an Oktoberfest. ""We cook our burgers here to well done. Is that okay?"" No, it is most certainly NOT okay, bartender, but she didn't bat an eye when I requested it be backed down to medium, so I guess they're used to it. I appreciated the warning.  I was happy to see my request actually caused the cook to err on the side of being underdone - there was still a good bit of pink left in my burger, as well as some moisture. As a result, the Crispy Jalapeno Burger had some cruft when considering the fried jalapenos, baja sauce, chipotle mayonnaise, and pepper jack cheese, but it was otherwise not bad. It could have been a lot worse.  There are different levels of chains, and though all of them have the same end goal in mind - a consistent product that can be produced within an acceptable level of time and - the atmosphere and research and development changes objectives: McDonalds want to supply decent burgers at the fastest speed and cheapest price ($2); Red Robin offers large burgers gussied up with crazy condiments and fried toppings ($12); Ruth's Chris sells you a high end experience and a burger that's been made fresh from all the other beef sitting in the back ($20). Cheesecake Factory and BJ's fall somewhere above Red Robin, but below Ruth's Chris. Once you get to those higher tiers, however, you're balancing quality of food with experience. You want to leave customers ecstatic once they walk out the doors. This is accomplished through thousand-calorie entrees of gut-busting proportions, plenty of high-alcohol drinks to get them sufficiently sozzled, and cap it off with a giant ice cream-covered chocolate chip pizza that has people remembering it for the rest of their day and come back next weekend. No, there's nothing wrong with this chain's kind of food, but the dubious nutritional value, soulless environment, and below-average beer doesn't make me eager to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=60

Good small meal, and I usually take some home too. I seldom get a big meal there b/c it is just too much food. Recently I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and it was delish. Yes, leftovers went home. 2 nice sized breast pieces cooked to perfection with fresh sundried tomatoes, and basil over the top, sprinkled with parm cheese, mashed potatoes, and done/crisp broccoli. Hubby got the roast beef dip sandwich. Huge sandwich, loaded with beef, and came with gravy and horseradish dip, he really liked. Also a side of seasoned steak fries.

I always order the avocado spring rolls.  They are fried avocado creamyness.  And we always order the pizza.  Usually BJ's cooks theirs until their crust was crispy and the innerds were hot and soft.  But this BJ's made their crust and innerds just plain soft.

Im not a beer fan so I didn't try out the beer.  I signed up for their membership, because I think i'll be frequenting their establishment  in the future.

Rachael H.,"Austin, TX",107,3,,4.0,3/1/2014,"My boyfriend and I are on a road trip from Minneapolis, MN to Austin, TX and last night Wichita was our halfway point. We were road weary and hungry and this place seemed like our best option. We were expecting to have to drop a lot of cash for mediocre food and gimmicky service (we usually avoid big chains like this), but we were pleasantly surprised.  Our server was Kayleigh and she was great. She was friendly, timed things well, and attentive without making us feel pressured in the way that can be common (and uncomfortable) in chains places. For dinner, we got a turkey burger and the Hawaiian mahi mahi. For $12.95, my expectations for the fish were low, but it was beautifully presented and very good. So many places would charge twice as much for something that tasted frozen, and I really appreciated that it was so much better than that--a nice, healthy, reasonably-portioned and fresh-tasting meal after a long day in the car. I also appreciated that even though it was busy, we were in and out quickly (but without feeling rushed). Also, the piranha pale ale was tasty. For two meals, a tomato and mozzarella salad, and two beers, the bill was $37! Awesome. Thanks, BJs, for not selling out like other chains, and not ripping people off. That's cool of you.

Overall, I liked the place, though I forsee it having the same fate as places like Fox and Hound - strong at first but will eventually die off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=80
Mike C.,"Fort Sill, OK",160,149,60,2.0,10/1/2012,This place was definitely over hyped to me. The food was decent but it wasn't anything special. I would eat there again but would never make a special trip just to go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=80
Ken J.,"Wichita, KS",0,1,,4.0,7/5/2013,"I've been to BJs quite a few times, trying out quite a variety of menu items (both to-go and dine in) and all have been quite delicious. Although in recent history, I have discovered a gem of a menu item. Thanks to signing up for the BJs rewards, my wife got an e-mail on her birthday for a free pzzookie (a cookie and ice cream.) While it didn't sound bad, it certainly didn't sound like anything great when we had gone before and didn't want to spend $7 on a dessert, but for free, we figured we'd give it a try. Since then, we'd tried 4 different types, each just as amazing as the last. It's gotten to the point where I can't imagine going to BJs Restaurant without ordering one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=80
Jaha H.,"Hainesport, NJ",0,5,,2.0,12/5/2012,"went for lunch on a wednesday.  Place was pretty busy at the time.  We were seated quickly.  Initially all seemed well, the waiter was prompt & attentive.  But after taking our order, things went downhill.  He forgot to bring one beer and had to be reminded, and then it was still slow.  Several incorrect orders were mixed up between tables.  Food was just OK, nothing to write home about. I would not go back again with other restaurants nearby. Atmosphere seems nice, plenty of beer selections.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=100
H B.,"Wichita, KS",1,6,4,4.0,11/19/2012,"Came here during the off lunch hour and loved it. My friend and I ordered the shrimp lettuce wrap for appetizer and it was delicious. The Santa Fe salad and the Salmon teriyaki were suited for the taste. Also, loved the apple berry crumble that we ordered for dessert. It wasn't too sweet, although a little runny/watery, so it dripped like crazy when my friend and I took a few spoonfuls.  Overall the food was good, and the local stout wasn't too bad, but next time, I'm just going to stick to Guinness instead. The service was good, to the point of too attentive. The server stopped by every few minutes. It was understandable since we were one of the only two tables occupied at the time. Liked the experience and will definitely go again to try more of their beers on tap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=100
Jillian B.,"Denver, CO",2,79,48,2.0,8/15/2012,"I went for lunch a couple weeks after they opened. What a disaster! We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, and the first table our hostess took us to had just been sat with another party. After arguing with a different hostess, we were taken back up to the front and had to wait another 5 minutes while they cleared a different table. Service was extremely slow. It easily took 10 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered. (And that was just iced tea- not anything from the bar) It took about an hour from the time we sat down until we finished our food. It felt like we were there forever. The pizza I had was tasty, but nothing special. I don't think the food is worth the price. I think I'll be willing to go back in a couple months once their staff is all trained and have things under control.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=100
Cody H.,"Wichita, KS",0,8,,5.0,1/29/2013,"We hardly get to the East side of Wichita, but when we do we try grab a bite to eat at BJ's.  The beer is great and the food was really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=100
Michael B.,"Mundelein, IL",37,11,1,4.0,2/5/2014,"In Wichita on business.  Good food, and a good fresh beer for a chain (didn't know it was a chain).  Tried the Porter and Chef salad at the bar one night, and came back the next for dinner as well. Did not disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=100
Chris M.,"Tonganoxie, KS",0,7,,1.0,1/8/2014,"The appetizer plate had food on it from the previous diner as did the drinking glass. I ordered enlightened chicken tacos for lunch. The place was half-full and they took 20 minutes and they came out cold and are actually taquitos. That must be the ""enlightened"" as in light on size, but nowhere was that stated. I didn't send them back for being cold because the server never returned. Not impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-wichita?start=100
