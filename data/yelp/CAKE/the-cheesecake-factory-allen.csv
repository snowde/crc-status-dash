Mya V.,"New York, NY",9,40,58,5.0,6/27/2016,"The staff is friendly and the food is great. Our table is always clean and the servers are very attentive.

Brian H.,"Richmond, TX",6,3,,2.0,1/14/2017,"Disappointing experience at the Cheesecake Factory this evening.  My food was fine.  Wife's burger was almost raw inside ... seriously, it looked like slimy raw ground beef and was cool to the touch.  They took it back to the kitchen, and cooked the already-cut-in-half burger more, plopped it in a new bun, and sent it back out.  No manager sent, no comp.  Tried to order cake to go, but they were out of the 2 kinds that I tried to order, so bailed on cake.  It took over 10 minutes from the time we asked for the bill to getting card back.  Not a very satisfying trip, especially for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=40
Pedro R.,"Allen, TX",2,21,47,5.0,9/27/2015,"We live in the complex and love the food here! Customer service is excellent and the employees know their menu well! We have ordered just about everything on the menu and know our favorites. The avacado eggrolls are amazing as well as the stuffed mushrooms! I always get the pasta dishes and sometimes the comfort food because they are so savory! The cheese cakes here are a bit expensive but they are so so good! You don't think it's going to taste that amazing but it does! The lemon merengue cheesecake is my absolute favorite among all that they have. You should try it if you love lemon merengue pie because it is so spot on in flavor! The service is on point and you never really have an empty glass, and the bread they serve you is always fluffy and warm! Always reserve when you can because waiting is no fun!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=40

Holly D.,"Dallas, TX",14,30,,4.0,6/9/2016,"This is a typical Cheesecake Factory.  They have awesome cheesecakes of almost every variety.  Certain days a year, you can get a half priced cheesecake, i think it's on their anniversary.  They have decent food.  It's definitely not a fancy 5-star restaurant, but is pretty good for the price range.  I love several dishes here, they have a decent and pretty good low-cal menu, and they have several items including pizza for the kids.  I don't order burgers here, I've had better burgers.   As with any restaurant, there is a wait if you come during peak hours.  I try to come late for lunch/early for dinner, or extremely late for dinner.  Also this restaurant is in an outdoor walking mall type area, so typical traffic means Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights are very hard to get in as a walk-in.  You can make reservations though.  The wait staff is always friendly, but I have noticed some of them seem to get a little overwhelmed when it gets crazy busy.  If you want a seamless meal, come during low-traffic hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=40
Irum J.,"Dallas, TX",108,124,38,4.0,9/5/2016,"Not as great as the one in Dallas (maybe becuase we're eating here and the crowds are so huge, unlike the one in Dallas that we only order to-go). Anyhow, dessert is impeccable, waitstaff is eager to serve but not as attentive as other places we've dined. Portions are large and fresh.

Hadi T.,"Allen, TX",42,17,25,1.0,7/21/2016,"Service always late We came in at 5:30 on a Sunday , half the place is empty , tables open on the patio and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table ....(short staffed)!!!! Then they started seating groups who had higher numbers of people than our group and who came after us, when we complained to the manager he said : on we can't seat 4 ppl on a table of 5?????? What?????? We got seated and ordered everything at once , drinks and food ... We got drinks 15 minutes later. This has been a habit with Cheesecake Factory . We complained to the manager about this whole thing and we requested the phone number to the corporate office to end up with some cell phone number of apparently another manager at the same location who never returned the call. If it wasn't for the kids, and hungry after a soccer game.... We wouldn't step a foot again in here . UPDATE TO MY 1 STAR REVIEW :: Where do we start .... My son puts our name down for 4 ppl including my father who's on a wheelchair . We were told 5-10 minutes wait on a Thursday evening. Waited and saw 3 more groups walking in right after us of 3 and 4 and 5 ppl per group and got seated right away. 45 minutes later We asked what's the deal - and the manager told the hostess who was extremely embarrass of the managers behavior when he said we haven't been waiting 45 minutes when she jumped in and said actually they have and it has been a long time . Then after feeling that he screwed up and I was asking him for any table he said you didn't ask for any table ..... So we seat you anywhere we want . I told him that's a bunch of bs , and not to mention he smelled and reeked of cigarettes out of his clothes and mouth while speaking to me which killed any appetite we had . When I told him next time do not argue based on NOT KNOWING facts. He said well , as a matter of facts am not going to give you a table and he asked us to leave with my dad who's been checked out of nursing home to go eat . He is one horrible manager to run such a restaurant . Thursday 7/21/2016 8:30pm in case corporate cares about their service and the hygiene and appearance of their managers who run an establishment that should scream cleanliness . For a manager to kick clients out for being such an arrogant behavior - you will lose more patrons as you have lost us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=40

Regina J.,"Los Angeles, CA",171,73,4,4.0,1/26/2016,"Honestly, the wait was not as bad as it may seem. Just a little backwards with informing patrons that their table is ready, but having them wait until someone can seat them is a little silly. Don't call people back to wait another indefinite amount of time.  The food was great. I ordered the Cuban Rolls for my family and I to try. We all agreed they were hot to the touch. But delicious. I ordered yhe BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad.....soo good but way way too much food. I barely made a dent and had to take 75% of it home. I am not a fan of leftovers, so I hope I do not waste it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=40
Tom K.,"Richardson, TX",30,15,,1.0,10/21/2016,"I called in to make a reservation for a party of 6 and was informed that they only except reservations on nights when there's no need to make a reservation. In other words, if they're slow - they'll take reservations, if they're busy - they won't take reservations. I then asked to speak with their manager in regards to this policy, after being put on hold for several minutes, three different employees picked up the phone and pretended to be the manager, only to eventually inform me that they were not the person with whom I ultimately needed to speak with. Once the actually manager picked up the phone to hear my grievance, he was anything but pleasant and/or interested in my thoughts.

Rose I.,"Dallas, TX",440,210,314,5.0,1/13/2016,"Honestly, I find it hard to write anything bad about any Cheesecake Factory I have been to. This one is always busy because it's the only one in Allen and located in the busy Watters Creek area which has apartments and retail shops, along with other restaurants. I used to work right next to a Cheesecake Factory a few years ago so I am very familiar with the menu as I used to go there for lunch a lot. I haven't met a menu item that I didn't like. And the desserts are absolutely phenomenal. If you are looking for a spot that is always a hit, this is it. Parking is not too bad if you don't mind walking a little, there's plenty in the garage next door. I've also ordered through the phone a few times and picked up. My favorite items include chicken samosas and any of the salmon dishes. I also love their chocolate tuxedo cheesecake and their 30th anniversary cheesecake. Always good! Enjoy! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=40

Nicole O.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,233,616,3.0,12/30/2015,"This place was packed when my family came to dine a few nights ago. Although we were told it'd be a 40 minute wait, we were seated after about 20 minutes. Our various meals were quite an assortment. We waited a fairly long time for our food to arrive. Luckily, my mom loves the whole wheat bread in the table basket. My dad ordered off the skinnylicious menu, and his pasta was seriously overcooked. It had the consistency of spoiled rice left at the bottom of a pot. Since it was inedible, he asked for a replacement and was given bowtie pasta with his shrimp with which he was okay. My mom ordered Bang Bang Chicken and was happy with it. I ha the rigatoni with shrimp and Italian sausage. It was passable. Usually I get excited with big portions due to my gluttonous nature, but I wasn't really that amped to eat my leftovers. The remaining dishes were also unremarkable. There were no lights in our eyes as we ate, but no one threw up either. Nevertheless, we were very pleased with our server Josh. He was quite attentive and knew when to interject. Also, we drink a lot of water and were happy with our refills. This restaurant is fine. Not worth a long wait, but due to the extensive menu, a viable option for families that cannot decide what to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=40

I would have liked more shrimp but everything was cook perfect..  BUT.. And here is where I have to take the one star off.. We ordered out cheesecakes to go.. I had wanted to try the peanut butter cup one.. And she had ordered the gadiva chocolate and the pumpkin ... Let say I went home  with the godiva chocolate.. It is good.. But **just a note..

Jennifer W.,"Plano, TX",590,1054,544,4.0,6/20/2013,"All of the Cheesecake Factory locations are great for their large menu. When you're trying to feed a variety of tastes there's pretty much always something for someone here. I also really love them for their skinnylicious menu now that I'm trying to lose the baby weight! This location is definitely on par with other locations in their food quality. This is what we had: -White Chicken Chili = One of my favorite dishes they have. It's hearty, warm, spicy and filling! I love the heat from the green chilis and it's not thin at all. It's very much like a chili and makes you feel so full with a HUGE amount of flavor. The fact that it's also on their low cal ""skinnylicious menu"" just makes it better. - Miso Salmon - My husband got this (added a picture of it) and not only is it beautifully presented but it's REALLY tasty. Highly recommend it. - Skinnylicious Soft Tacos - Comes with three tacos with chicken and veggies and a spicy sauce. My grandparents both ordered this and although they like spicy they said it was more heat than they expected. Just FYI! They loved it though and felt that the three tacos was a really ample portion. My step-grandmother even brought one home to eat later. - Skinnylicious Grilled Turkey Burger - My mom got this and said that it was tasty. She wasn't ooh'ing and aah'ing over it though. This location lost a star though because I had some of the worst customer service when I went here for Father's Day. We called ahead to see if they were doing a list and the hostess laughed at me and in a rude way said ""Uh, no, we don't do lists."" So I was already irritated when I arrived with my husband and I, our newborn and my grandparents. Then we were seated and had the RUDEST waitress we have ever had, to write all the sarcastic/rude things she said/did would take forever. Just know that in the first 30 mins there (when we still didn't have food) my husband was so appalled by her behavior he went and complained to a manager. So.... food? awesome. Service? Not so much. To be fair, I did see some other nice waiters and waitresses and the manager that apologized to us for our waitress and for our food taking forever (and being wrong once, because our waitress put it in wrong) was also nice.

So delicious, but from the moment we entered til the moment we left, the staff    From the hostess to the bartenders, the waiter  and the assistants that helped them run plates were consistent in one attitude and it wasn't one of warmth, friendliness, or welcoming. They were pretty consistent across the board with rudeness, shortness, and as if we the guest were a bother to them.  Although I mentioned it was my birthday they still did nothing  and even getting our check when we were done and had enough of the ""atmosphere"" took forever to get. So much that our family had to just walk out and leave my husband behind to pay because we were just done.  It is sad say and we spent money at the bar and at our table.

The service and quality of the food used to be fantastic but the last 3 times we have eaten there it has been pretty disappointing. The food has either been cold or over cooked each time we have been there over our last 3 visits. When you have a family of 7 and you go to a restaurant that is over a $100 to feed your family you expect good quality food and this location just has not met the service/quality levels over the last few months.

Amanda S.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",92,50,27,1.0,3/28/2011,"This was my first time at this location. Usually we go to the CF by North Park Mall. Our experience at this location was less than stellar.  We went out to celebrate my mom's birthday so it was a special occasion. After a 45 minute wait @ 5pm we finally got seated. It took our waitress another 20 minutes to come over and just greet us. Another 20 minutes to bring the drinks out and then another 40 minutes to actually bring the food!  After we had given her strict instructions about how to prepare our food she got 3 out of 6 of our dinner incorrect. She brought my vegetarian mother bacon on her pasta, my grandma's salad had no dressing on it and my son's hamburger sliders that were specifically asked to put cheese on had none.  While realizing that most of our meals were wrong we were dying of thirst. Our waitress could never keep a drink filled. After my mom approached her about the meat being on her pasta the waitress cleared her plate and took it back to remove the bacon. In the mist of the 45 minutes my mom waited, the manager came over to apologize and tried to smooth everything over. Meanwhile, the waitress brought my grandma dressing....but a different kind. After everyone at our table had finished eating they finally brought my mom's meatless pasta out.  After sitting in front of our empty plates or plates that were waiting to be doggy bagged we waited another 30 minutes for our waitress to come ask if we needed a doggy bag or the check. After getting the doggy bags and the check she took another 15-20 minutes to run our cards.  We will not go back to this location again.

Jennifer G.,"Dallas, TX",344,608,123,2.0,7/31/2008,"I could say - Ditto to Aimee's review, but I think I'll try to be more creative about it.  I should have known from the second I pulled into the parking lot and was stuck in a gridlock because of the idiots that were stopped at where they thought there should be a valet. Umm see the stand over there put away and the no valets standing here? Good. Now MOVE ALONG, but apparently they didn't notice. Finally made it to the parking garage where I passed Aimee - she was going down and I was going up - She advised there was NO PARKING up there so I was able to find a place to turn around before I got to the cluster that was at the dead end of the parking garage (THANK YOU!!!). On my way back down I stalked some lovely people that were leaving and jacked their spot YAY!! Finally. Some of our party had gotten there an hour earlier and been quoted 55-70 min so I figured we'd be eating shortly. Went out and hung out by the water between Brio and CF. Nice little spot, but there was a storm looming and as I looked around I thought if it starts raining and ALL THESE people go inside we'll have issues. I better beat them to the punch. Went inside. Waited ANOTHER hour. Watched 3 ppl come to complain to the manager about their service. I was getting scared. FINALLY our table was ready. I ordered a Georgia peach immediately. After all that chaos I SO needed a drink. The service was decent considering and the food was standard CF. I noticed as we were eating that the table next to us waited about 30+ min for their cheesecake to arrive so I got the jump start on getting the heck out of there by having the waitress bring us our checks and boxes for the cheesecake while we were waiting - and we still waited a long time for the cheesecake. It was delicious, but not worth the 3 hrs of my life I just wasted trying to get it. I might go back here again, but there are locations closer to me so I doubt it. If I'm in this neck of the woods again - I'm going to Brio.

I will however, have to report that I had what was probably the single best entree I have ever had at any Cheesecake Factory before.  I will now take this opportunity to recommend the Spicy Cashew Chicken (ask for extra sauce on the side).  YUM. Unfortunately, they were sold out of my favorite cheesecake... the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Cheesecake.  I opted for the Pistachio Mousse Cheesecake.  It didn't hit the spot that had been dreaming about white chocolate nutty goodness all day.

I had the Bistro Shrimp pasta, which sounded yummy in the  description but the shrimp was little under done and too buttery, I can't believe I just said that, I'm the butter queen.  My dining companion had the special of the day, grilled salmon with broccoli and French fries,  We both thought it a little odd that they served French fries with grilled Salmon, so he opted for double broccoli.   The wait staff was a little too attentive and always seemed to show up mid sentence to ask how things were.  I'm sure a few more months of training and they will be able to figure out if interruptions are necessary.  All in all it was a pleasant experience, more due to the company.  I'm not in a hurry to go back, unless I'm craving cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=180

It took about 5 minutes before we were attended to.  We immediately ordered food along w/ our drink order, since we've had so much time to browse the menu.  Two waters with lemon, two mojitos, a salad, and a pasta dish.  The waiter brought out bread about 5 minutes later, and said he forgot our waters.  WTF...he finally shows up with our waters.  Our food came out pretty quickly after that...10 min or so, brought out by a food runner (who was a nice guy).  No mojitos in sight....*shrug*   We began eating and were enjoying the meal while talking.  I had finished up about half of my pasta dish finally when the server came to ask how things were going.  He immediately realized he forgot our mojitos.  He said the bar was backed up and apologized.  He disappeared around the corner and reappeared immediately.  Seems as though our drinks were just sitting on the bar waiting for them to be brought to us. While eating we noticed a lone diner eating by herself.  Because of our subpar service, we began to notice other diners waiting extremely long times for their drinks, orders, and checks.  This lady that was eating by herself had finished eating for a good 15 minutes.  She was sitting there VERY patiently just holding her credit card in her hand...just waiting for the server to SEE SHE WAS READY TO LEAVE!!! Another couple was apologized to about 6 times before they even got their order taken.  They sat down before us, and they got their food AFTER we finished ours.  Other tables had empty water glasses which were screaming to get refilled.  Seriously folks, food service is not rocket science.  Take a drink order, bring out drinks, take a food order, bring out food, bring the check, all is well.   I'll have to say this was one of the WORST service experiences I've had at a restaurant in at least the past two years.  The food was good, and I enjoyed it.  But the service was horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=180

She was very nice and even went to double check that the caesar dressing they had didn't have raw eggs since I'm pregnant. Pick up was a breeze and the girl I ordered from was there and another guy. Such a pleasant place to order from! On to the food. I ordered chicken mushroom lettuce wraps, dinner sized chicken caesar salad and red velvet cheesecake. Once I got home and got everything out, it all looked pretty great. The lettuce wraps are almost laughable though. They give you little thin pieces of lettuce to try to maneuver the chicken onto...I ended up just using the lettuce like giant chopsticks when I gave up on strategically spooning the chicken into the lettuce leaves and having everything fall apart.  The caesar salad looked delicious and I've been craving one for a while. Tried the chicken before eating and it was SO yummy! Juicy and seasoned just right. The dressing...left to be desired for a good caesar. I'm not sure if they gave me the skinny dressing instead of regular (I ordered the regular) but it had a faint taste of yogurt to it and pretty much ruined the salad. Tastes nothing like good dressing should. Red Velvet cheesecake though, that was the best part of my entire meal!

To me, a restaurant that has lots of choices does few things well. I thought I would have the fish tacos and finish with some cheesecake. When I was served, I couldn't believe how much food there was! There were four or five fish tacos and sides of beans and rice. It was crazy! I am glad I chose something relatively healthy.

My shrimp were overly breaded burnt and soggy soggy. My pasta was not topped with arugula it was covered with a mountain of this stuff completely ruined the dish. On the upside hubby's mashed potatoes were pretty good and the hot wings were decent  but I've had better at Applebee's and Outback. Needless to say we both ate about 20% of our meal.

Craig J.,"Wheeling, WV",266,95,28,2.0,9/10/2013,"I hate to give a bad review but I must be honest. I love the cheesecake factory. In fact cheesecake is only of my strongest vices. We went here for my mom's birthday and this place is right down the street from the homestead. This location was not good. Wait time was long but that is completely fine as it was a Friday night. You'd have to be crazy to expect a wait time any shorter than 30 minutes on a Friday night. Our server was obviously over sat and it took him a good 15 minutes or so to even acknowledge we were there. By the time he actually got to us, we had so much time that we had the entire meal already selected. Not to put him down or anything of the sort but you have to at least say something to the table like ""I'll be with you in a minute, what can I get you to drink?"" and then ask for help. But even our server was not that big of a deal to us (we're really laid back). It was my meal...It took about 30 minutes to get it out to the table after we ordered. By that time I was ravenous. I was on this no carb gluten free kick so I ordered a no bun turkey burger. Now out of all the times I've been to Cheesecake factory more times than I can count. I've never gotten the same thing twice (cheesecake excluded) and I've never been disappointed until now. I can't even describe the taste as an actual flavor. Imagine if you will the smell of new born puppy breath. Now take that smell, translate it into taste and put it in some poor sap's burger...that's the only way I can describe it...puppy breath. Couldn't even take another bite I was so nauseated. Ordered something different no problem (my mom's steak was way over cooked also). Over all, not a good experience for my Clan. We will be going back but it'll be a while before I get another turkey burger from them. That reminds me...I want a puppy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=160

We did not have any straws to drink water and the waiter was not anywhere around so we could ask for something. When we had almost finished the bread without any butter since we did not have any knives, the waiter came. I asked him to bring utensils and straws, with a rude attitude, he said, ""Anything else while I'm here?"" Finally, the food came. My son's napkin was dirty but no sign of the waiter to ask for a clean one. We needed more ketchup, but, again, waiter was not around.

I've even found myself stuck home while hubby is on a business trip and I don't want to cook dinner so, Favor to the rescue! We're having Cheesecake Factory for dinner. And maybe a slice or two of cheesecake too. One thing you can absolutely say about CF is their portions do not leave you hungry.  I've recently enjoyed... + Beets w/Goat Cheese salad - fresh, tasty and great portion + Chicken Samosas - great portion of chicken, the flavor and spice are right on. Do yourself a favor and ask for extra Cilantro dipping sauce  + Thai Lettuce Wraps are my favorite - this can easily be a meal, not just an appetizer. There is a great amount of chicken and toppings and the spicy Thai sauces are YUMMY! + Avocado Egg Rolls - divine. Crunchy outside, perfectly cooked inside. Also make sure to ask for extra dipping sauce, it's really tasty + Chinese Chicken Salad - it's HUGE! I request keeping the Rice Noodles off as they just overwhelm the bowl and have zero taste.  + Kids Grilled Cheese - my boys love this one. It's a full size grilled cheese presented in a kid-friendly and appealing way. Plus their fries are so good you'll want to eat them too. And of course Cheesecake.

I order chicken teriyaki and brown rice and my friend orders that truffle honey chicken. We were both planning on dessert but when I bit into my chicken it tasted wet and cold. Skin was still attached and it felt like it was frozen before boiled and teriyaki sauce dumped on it. It wasn't good at all. I went into the restroom and had to throw up from it. There was jasmine rice and something diced and put on the side that looked like chopped onions, something stuck there beside the chicken that was burnt along with the outside of the chicken skin but the inside wasn't cooked all the way through.

Stacie A.,"Dallas, TX",83,154,15,4.0,1/19/2013,"I have to preface this review by stating that I've never met a Cheescake Factory that I didn't like. Although I do find their book-sized menu to be a little anxiety inducing, their food is always good. Pricey, but good. The Allen location is no exception. Went there this Friday expecting a long wait but it only took us about 20 minutes to be seated. Service was great. Food was great. Cheesecake was even better. I think the company has even managed to squeeze in some additional cheesecake flavors on the menu, thus causing me to seriously consider spending an unmentionable amount of money to sample a few interesting looking options. Thankfully, my dining partner encouraged me to stick with my usual - the coconut chocolate cheesecake. Yum! The only drawback about this location is the parking. As with all things in the Allen/McKinney suburbs this place is packed and parking is hard to find. Fortunately, the restaurant offers complimentary valet. Now if I could only remember to keep cash on me for tips!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=120

Which is extremely disappointing since I love Cheesecake Factory. The hostesses always act like you're bothering them by coming in. The first two times, both times we were told they were short-staffed. Our second time we had a waitress who, I'll be honest she was downright strange. She acted as if she was on another planet, we had to strain to hear her, and we hardly ever saw her unless she was clearing our half full drinks and I had to wrestle my straw from my glass as she was walking away with it because it took 20 minutes to get the straw in the first place. This last time will definitely be the last time. Our waitress got our drink order and then proceeded to completely ignore us for 10+ minutes. We got up and left and went to Chuy's where we had phenomenal service.

Curtis Humanities S.,"Allen, TX",0,21,2,5.0,6/3/2014,"Is the Cheesecake Factory Worth All the Hype? - 2DC With all the hype, I couldn't help but eat here, and the inner critic in me had no reason to resist either. So with anticipating feelings seemingly like that of a college graduate coming into the risky money-sucking adult life, I waltzed in and opened the doors into the famous diner. I ordered an Americana Cheeseburger, with burger cooked medium rare, along with French fries as a side. What came after my meal was given to me was a delightful and astonishing experience that left me wanting more. Right when you walk in, a full team of greeters are ready at attention by a counter on your left, with their black uniforms and the speed they handled things they were like a fully operational SWAT team. As my mother and I were led to our table, walking by fancy Egyptian like pillars, I noticed the cheerful yet fancy atmosphere of the place. You could hear the chatter of waiters and diners, as well as the clinging of plates and pans coming everywhere. We were given a menu as soon as we sat down. The menu was long, a bit overwhelming, but the food descriptions were short yet descriptive. This way, I could know what exactly I wanted. A waiter came to us soon after we were given a table, unfortunately I forgot his name, but he was quite friendly and nice. After giving us our drinks and taking our orders, he gave us some appetizing bread which was well baked. I excused myself to the bathroom, as it is common knowledge that the state of a restaurant's bathroom equals the state of their kitchen. Their bathroom was quite clean and spacey, so I could now fully enjoy my meal knowing it wasn't cooked in a disgusting place. The wait for our food was quite lengthy, about 20 minutes, I expected they would be more efficient especially at lunch time. But when I saw our waiter walking up with our orders, it was like heaven had opened and the angels were singing. My meal was nicely arranged, and it took me all of my strength not to stuff it all down in one go. The burger was quite big, causing me to cut it in half. But as I bit down, the great juiciness and cheesiness of the food hit me all at once. I could tell the meat was prepared carefully, and the delicate handiwork of the chef showed through the food. The fries had the right amount of crispness and saltiness. Everything was perfect. The fantastic meal filled me up pretty quickly, and we asked for some takeout boxes, only for our waiter to take it up and prepare the boxes himself, showcasing the restaurant's great service. Needless to say, me and my entourage left very pleased, and we felt we certainly got our money's worth. I beat myself up for waiting 14 years to dine at the Cheesecake Factory, and I certainly will find myself going back. They have great service, and although the wait is a bit lengthy, it's worth it. I definitely recommend visiting this restaurant, during lunch or dinner, either way you won't leave feeling unsatisfied.

Mark P.,"Allen, TX",20,12,,1.0,12/21/2014,"After 5 years of off and on again promises to never visit this location, yesterday was the final straw. This is the worst execution of a Cheesecake Factory location I've been too.    Let's face it, Cheesecake Factory is (at it's core) is an upscale diner chain. With that in mind, the price points are high but generally proportionate to the ""OMG, I'm going to need a to go box when my order arrives"" sub-theme of success that many chain restaurants embrace now (i.e. Olive Garden, Maggiano,s, etc..). I could go several paragraphs about that corporate restaurant strategy, but back to the subject at hand.    Yesterday, we decided to give the Allen CF another try. Amazingly, we were seated immediately w/o any attitude or clumsiness by the usually inept host staff that has ruled this location with rudeness and indifference as if it's encouraged and rewarded by management. We arrived at 4PM and the restaurant was about 1/3 full. Usually a good sign of prompt service we were greeted by a server who (throughout the meal) was consistently 2 steps behind in hitting service points. Each of us (party of four) ordered something different, but nothing unusual - no modifiers, splits or anything that could slow down overall service. At this point I'll cut to the chase: 2 pasta dishes were flavorless and incomplete in preparation another ( a pepperoni pizza) seemed to be a facsimile of an actual proper pizza and the turkey burger I ordered came out as a turkey club. I sent it back (held on to the side salad) and was assured my turkey burger would arrive asap. When it did arrive it was a flavorless mess on a 4"" cold white bun. I had 3 bites and started to envision getting a Whataburger on the way home. The manager did the right thing by comping off the burger but seemed unconcerned that 3 other guests were leaving less than happy.   In short, if you are a big fan of CF, visit any location other than Cheesecake Factory Allen, TX.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=120

Bill B.,"Dallas, TX",102,580,1772,5.0,10/12/2014,"THE RESTAURANT--You and I have both been to a restaurant that after being seated we ask why are we here. There is no intrigue and the place might as well be part of a haunted house. Not this Cheesecake Factory location. This is a location that you can be comfortable when taking your spouse, your girl friend or business client to lunch or dinner. The inside if the restaurant if very nice with dark woods on the seats and counters and light pastel colors on the walls and ceiling. Just a very nice setting in which to enjoy your food. Parking is scarce out front of the restaurant and more than likely you will have to find a space in the parking garage just a few feet to the south. Parking is free. The rest room for men is nice but very small. There is only one commode and one urinal for men in a restaurant of this size which probably does not meet code standards.  THE FOOD   I have been here many times and I have decided I concentrated too much on things other than the food. We started with some fresh iced tea and coffee. I must have gotten the first glass of iced tea and it was perfect with a  deep tea flavor that had not been watered down by having sat in ice for an hour. The coffee was freshly brewed and as good a cup as you can get even if purchased at a  coffee shop. Bread was brought to the table and that was a loaf of white and a loaf of dark wheat bread with real butter in the basket. The breads were excellent. Today we ordered for lunch, the Herb Crusted Salmon, mashed new potatoes and asparagus with the salmon being covered with a not too overpowering lemon sauce. The salmon was some of the best we have ever tasted and the lemon sauce made the presentation excellent. The lemon sauce is a little tart nevertheless delicious. The piece of salmon was about 1 1/2 inch thick with the size being most generous. The asparagus was crisp and tender and cooked perfectly as were the new mashed potatoes. THE SERVICE   Was met at the hostess counter by a nice hostess who asks where we would like to sit. That was a first time we have ever been ask where we like to sit at this location and we chose a small booth, which we were promptly, taken to. The waiter was outstanding in taking our order and most efficient in brining our food as quickly as it was prepared. The food was still very hot as was the plate on which it was being served. PRICING    The menu at a Cheesecake Factor is extensive. We had decided on the herb crusted salmon at $19.95 when the waiter ask if we desired the lunch portion or dinner portion. There was a $6.00 difference in the price thus lunch was only $13.95. We opted for the lunch portion and that was plenty of food. The menu had dozens and dozens of items on it and is actually like a loose leaf notebook. It will take sometime to browse through the entire ""book"". If you are there during lunch hours (7 days a week) be sure and ask about the lunch menu.  Today was a great ding experience with very good food at a very reasonable price.

My husband had the Parmesan chicken that came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The beans were a bit heavy on the lemon flavor but overall a fantastic dish. Both items could be shared-large portions. Finished with the snickers cheesecake... Yum yum yum! (Comes loaded with whip cream so ask your server to go easy on it if you're not a huge fan).

On my last visit, I ordered the mushroom burger. When it came time for my table to have its food delivered, my burger didn't make it. A food runner or another server came by and asked if I ordered a veggie burger, which I declined. It turns out my mushroom burger accidentally ran to the wrong table. Honestly, I didn't mind at all, as I wasn't that hungry. Two people plus a manager stopped by my table to apologize about the situation. After a multitude of sorries (which I thought wasn't a big deal after all) I finally got my mushroom burger. It only took like, an extra 10 minutes. The server even said that they will comp my meal...seriously? Well, the people who work here must freak out a lot or are just genuinely apologetic. They must be lucky that I'm not one of those fussy types of customers who get aggravated easily for no big reason. Mistakes happen. I get it.  Speaking of which, I hope a genuine vegetarian didn't mistakenly consume an actual burger - now THAT would suck.  I'm not really going to comment a lot about the taste of the food, since almost everyone has eaten at The Cheesecake Factory, among all corporate-type restaurants.

My husband and I rarely eat out for reasons that will be revealed, but we decided to go out Friday night for a date. When we were seated, the first 2 tables the hostess tried to seat us at, were absolutely disgusting. Crumbs on the tables and the seats and silver wear on the floor under the table. The whole place looked like it had been very poorly cleaned and it's easy to see how that can happen when there's a number of employees just standing around. the food was certainly nothing to brag about. flavorless food that needed acid and fresh herbs.

With that being said, I must say, this place is always celebrating someone's birthday! There was one random day when we went on a Tuesday night, literally 9 people had celebrated their birthdays in that time! Crazy! I'd get so tired of singing ""Happy Birthday"" to the guests but it was fun!  Sometimes the kitchen messes up your orders but it's not big deal. They're really good and prompt about fixing it and don't make you feel guilty for doing so! I really appreciate that!  Don't forget to get some cheesecake. If you're too full, buy one to go!

Chad D.,"Plano, TX",89,304,553,1.0,6/15/2014,"we went around 930p last night to have drinks and dessert. we were seated pretty quickly which was nice.  the hostess sat us next to a large group that was celebrating a birthday. as we sat and looked at the menu, another large group sat down on the other side of us. we noticed a waiter came and took drink orders from the table that sat after us, no big deal, maybe we're not in his section. then a girl comes out and takes dessert orders from the birthday group. both the waiter and waitress were now working both tables, bringing out drinks, clearing plates, etc. after 10-15 mins of waiting, a bus boy showed up to clean the booth behind me so I asked him if we could speak with a manager. he found a manager and I assume was telling him we wanted to speak with him. I could tell that the manager was reluctant to come over because he kept looking at our table and looking away as the bus boy was talking to him. he finally came over and the first thing he says was, ""so you guys have been waiting a while?"" I didn't catch his name because he didn't bother introducing himself, so he may not have even been a manager for all we know. all I know of him is that he's tall, skinny and bald. I assume he's a manager because he wasn't in white. but again, he didn't introduce himself so who knows.  we gave the ""manager"" our order and he walks off. a couple minutes later, the girl that was working the birthday table next to us came over to apologize because ""the table you're sitting at hasn't been used all night so we didn't know who it beloved to."" her and the guy waiter were working both tables around us and yet no one bothers to check to see who has the table that's sitting there with menus and no drinks? by the time we finally got our beers and two slices of cheesecakes (that are premade and comes to the restaurant frozen, no cooking required) the table that sat AFTER us already had their food, that I assume is made to order. to the waitress' credit, after we made our complaint, she was very attentive afterwards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=60

It was my mother's birthday the other day, so we took her here. Our house is basically in between this location and the North Park one so we decided to switch it up and go here. BIG MISTAKE! Our waiter forgot everything from the simplest thing (bring lemons for our water, despite being asked twice) to gathering a few staffers to sing Happy Birthday. Now, I know they still do it because we heard them sing to no less than 4 other tables that night! What did we get?

Lee J.,"Garland, TX",1,5,,1.0,3/20/2016,"I only give this place one star because I couldn't give it less! I have gone to this place on several occasions all special because it has a very nice ambiance. I've had to wait upwards to an hour but,I understood and out was okay. My husband had a surprise birthday dinner for me there a couple of years ago and it went off flawlessly. The person he had in charge of getting there and getting the time slot only had an hour wait and when I got there we were able to walk right back to my waiting party of about 30 guests. This year he chose to go back there and surprise me. My party was yesterday 3/19 I had an idea that he was planning something I just wasn't sure where. We arrived at The Cheesecake Factory at 7:30 where my gusts had been waiting an hour AND we were told it would be another hour and a half!!! We ended up not getting seated until close to 9:00!!! How ridiculous!!! We spoke to a manager and he said he was trying to help figure out what was talking so long. He didn't come back. Once we were finally seated were given dirty silverware. Without truly knowing who our server was our drink order was finally taken- but not in it's entirety, nude test was taken buy a different guy who wasn't our server but ended up helping her out. He brought us wrapped silverware( the first ones weren't). Our food orders were placed after drink orders were finally corrected. Please tell me WHY ALL OF OUR FOOD ORDERS CAME OUT SEPARATELY????!!!!! There was about a 10 minute lag between each order coming out. This was completely unbelievable! We had to ask for the menu again to order some cheesecake and the girl server asked if we wanted it to go....even though there was at least 45 minutes until closing. I asked the male serverfor the GM's name and number and he was off last night so I couldn't speak with him. I will NOT be going back unless this is rectified.

We were surprised the restaurant was not full and our wait was only 5 min.  After our meal it was clear why there were few people at the restaurant.  We ordered Shelia's chicken & avocado salad and the chicken salad sandwich.   The lettuce in the salad  was all romaine vs mixed greens, had lots of carrots and very little avocado and cilantro. The chicken, however, was moist but sparse.  We asked for the salad to be served with dressing on the side. Salad was delivered with no dressing. Took 5-8 minutes to receive the dressing. Not what you would expect for a $15 salad.  The chicken salad sandwich turned out to be more of a tomato & lettuce sandwich as there was more tomato than chicken salad on the sandwich.  Not what you would expect for $13. Rip-off! We didn't bother contacting the Mgr as we never saw them in our area/section checking on customer's satisfaction.  Our 2nd choice fire roasted fresh artichoke appetizer was fantastic.

I ordered an Arnold Palmer which was served very cold rimmed with sugar. I really like this as the Grand Lux is the only other place I have had it served this way. It was a great drink. The bread was not toasted well which makes sour dough very chewy. It was not good. I ordered the lunch portion of spaghetti and meatballs and it was very good and the right amount of food.

Gloria C.,"Allen, TX",159,214,633,5.0,12/11/2015,"It's always packed here, but my husband and I came here late on a Sunday night so it wasn't too bad. Wait time for 2 was about 10-15 minutes so at least it was true  to what they said it would be. I hate it when they say it's 30 minutes and it's more like 45 to an hour. I'd rather them lie and say it would take longer and be called earlier than to be late, but perhaps that's just me. You're always welcome to make reservations.  Atmosphere: There's dim lighting, but decor is always extravangant but not too gaudy. It can be loud because of the amount of customers they have. The place has always been clean for me.  Service: Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. She came over just enough times to meet our needs without being too overbearing or seem liked she was ignoring us.  Food: I'm always a fan of the complimentary bread and butter. Their dishes are definitely big so it's a good idea to share. My husband and I had the Thai Chili wraps and the shepherd's pie. The wraps are so good and it's huge so it can easily be your meal. You get 5-6 pieces of lettuce, accompanied with marinated and grilled chicken slices, and you can dress it with pickled cucumbers, thai noodles, carrot slices, and bean sprouts. You also get 3 sauces to choose from; sweet, peanut sauce, and spicy. I sometimes throw it all together. This dish can get messy, but it's all good. The pie was so comforting to eat on a cold evening. I feel as if the mashed potatoes encase the rest of the ingredients so well that it keeps the dish warm with every bite and everything is so flavorful. I found myself still picking at it even after I was already full. We were too full for cheesecake this time, but perhaps next time.  I need to try other foods next time, but that's what I said the last time that I was here. I can't stay away from my favorites. Until next time Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-allen?start=20
