Robert W.,"Patterson, CA",1670,147,857,5.0,1/6/2018,"Went here for my mother in laws birthday with a group of twenty two on a Saturday night. We had them split the bill into five different checks. They were able to sit us right away with a reservation. I've never been a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory (besides the cheesecake itself) but this experience changed my perspective. To start, besides the quick seating which I already stated, the service was outstanding. They were on top of everything we asked for. The drinks were constantly filled, the food came out promptly and they did it all with friendly service. We had a small group come in a little late and the got them up to speed very quickly with drinks and food. The menu is so big with such a variety it's super hard to decide what to eat. I decided to go with the orange chicken. You can order full or half size and it comes with steamed rice and vegetables. I ordered the full size plate and it was absolutely delicious with enough chicken to feed two. I didn't hear any complaints no matter what anyone ordered at the table.  We topped the night off with, of course , the cheesecake. My favorite is the key lime but they have plenty of flavors to choose from. Definitely recommend if your visiting Anaheim and Disneyland!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim
Dr. O.,"Menifee, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/6/2018,"This review is in regards to employee knowledge about parking validation at the Anaheim location, not the actual food itself. I went on Saturday, January 6, 2018. I met up with a friend I don't get to see very often and we ate and talked for quite some time. I got my parking validated at the front of the restaurant right before leaving and the girl told me it had a validation of 3 hours. I immediately walked to my car and as I was leaving the parking structure the arm didn't raise after entering my validated ticket. The girl in the parking booth informed me that I had to pay $3 for being 8 minutes into the next hour, which would make perfect sense if the validation was for only 2 hours, but I was told it was validated for 3 hours. I told her that the person at Cheesecake Factory told me the validation was for 3 hours and she rolled her eyes and said that, ""That happens all the time."" She said the validation from them is only good for a maximum of 2 hours and sooner or later they would hopefully start sharing the correct information with customers.  I called Cheesecake Factory when I got home just to let them know they told me the validation was for 3 hours when in fact the parking garage said the validation is only good for a maximum of 2 hours. The person on the phone told me that was wrong and it is in fact validated for 3 hours by them. I asked if it was even possible to validate parking for 2 OR 3 hours, thinking possibly the girl at the front just didn't validate it for the maximum amount of time for some strange reason? He said ""No,"" and explained that all validations are automatically done for 3 hours; that's the only option. I was thoroughly confused and asked to speak to a manager hoping to get the final, real story. The man on the phone put me on hold for a while before coming back on the line himself to tell me he was the manager (why was I put on hold, then?). He again confirmed that parking is validated for 3 hours and I told him the parking garage says differently. He said the third party who owns the parking garage has never indicated that the validation is only for 2 hours and they inform him if anything changes. I suggested he check with them because employees shouldn't be sharing the incorrect validation time.  I don't know if it's the fault of the parking garage or Cheesecake Factory, but they are giving customers contradictory information and I don't appreciate paying out of my own pocket because they can't get the story straight. I was also disappointed the ""manager"" (I'm doubting this is who I talked to) didn't say anything other than it's news to him if it's only validated for 2 hours; no indication of following up in any way. I won't be returning to this particular Cheesecake Factory if they can't communicate directly with the parking structure where you need to park. Very disappointing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim
Zsanette Z.,"Hemet, CA",1,25,29,3.0,12/27/2017,"Mesmerized by the tall ceilings and large open dining area, you'll be swept in.  You'll pass the large glass cheesecake display, the hustle and bustle of the kitchen, and I'm sure you'll notice the, above top shelf, bar.  However, the glitz and glam will fade once seated at the table that is covered in crumbs, with spotty silverware. Your seat will have bits of food left there after falling from the table that was given a half-ass wipe down. The waitress will have arrived promptly. If you go, ask for Karina. She's attentive, polite, and friendly.  The food was average. Presentation was well.  Drinks were served in dirty glasses. The cheesecake, of course, saved this dining experience.  Friend ordered the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. It had a strong vanilla flavor with a smooth finish. I ordered the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. It was a sweet and tangy explosion, with a coconut base.  All in all, I would dine here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to feast at this location.  TIP: Ask the waitress/waiter to validate your parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim
Sara F.,"Calgary, Canada",85,67,40,5.0,12/21/2017,"Amazing....and delicious! How can you visit the US without hitting up the Cheese Factory? Large menu with some great favourites like the Avocado Eggrolls...yummm! But the main attraction is the Cheesecake...obviously!  Everyone at our table ordered their own cheesecake which all tastes soooo good. Carrot cake cheesecake was the best, birthday cake cheesecake was tasty, the original cheesecake is simply a classic, and the turtle cake was also good. Once we received our cakes....everyone else around us ordered their own cakes after seeing ours...haha.  Overall great service and the patio was really enjoyable during the nice outdoor weather.  Gotta go here...it's close to Disney and a great change of scenery and food from a long week at the park.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim
Matt F.,"Yonkers, NY",45,401,540,3.0,9/30/2017,"It's ok. Over the years I heard a lot of hype about The Cheesecake Factory, though I never had a chance to eat at one until now. To me personally, it's a standard restaurant and wasn't as ""great"" as I've heard. Don't get me wrong, it's ok - but I don't see what the fuss was about either.  And in all fairness, I understand The ""Cheesecake"" Factory is probably popular because of their desserts, but I didn't have any so this review is about everything but that.  Located in the Anaheim GardenWalk, this is about a block or two from Disney (depending on which direction you're walking from) - so expect crowds based off of that and on The Cheesecake Factory's popularity.  It was very crowded and we had to wait for about 20 minutes for a seat (my limit is 15, but I was feeling generous that day). We were given a choice of seating in which to wait for, but we wanted a booth so that may have been it. The place is also very noisy, so if you're looking for a quieter dining experience, then this place isn't for you. The decor......is blah. I wasn't expecting cheesecake wallpaper or something, but to me it just appeared bland. But small potatoes.  The menu was ok, though on the pricier end. I ordered my usual burger and while it tasted just fine, I've had both better and cheaper at the same time. None of us wanted dessert, so we got the check after the dinner. Maybe next time IF I decide to go back to a Cheesecake Factory, I will try something sweet or even a slice of cheesecake.  The waiter was friendly and attentive.  Overall an option in the area full of good options. If you're looking to save a little and/or a quieter or less busy experience, then you could probably find it elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim
Reg G.,"Orange, CA",95,92,222,3.0,11/29/2017,"I hate to give one of my favorite restaurants a 3 star rating but unfortunately the product has not been meeting expectations.  Let's start with the complimentary bread and butter. It's hard to mess that up right? Well they seem to find a way to do so. Nine times out of ten, the. Bread the bring is cold. Who wants to eat cold bread? Not I.  Secondly, everyone I come I order the eggplant Parmesan. And when it's available, it it incredible. They are consistent with this dish. When I was a meat eater I used to get the chicken bellagio and that was incredible. But those days are long gone and I'm committed to this vegetarian/border line vegan thing. Cheesecake Factory is my cheat day restaurant. So lately all Cheesecake factories have been running out of the eggplant Parmesan. I still don't understand how you can manage to do that. So it's been throwing me off and making me think outside the box on what to order on their rather large menu.  Thank God I found a great tasting appetizer, the Korean fried cauliflower. Yum yum in my tum tum. Seriously! It taste like I'm eating sweet and sour and orange chicken. It's delicious. That's been a saving grace for me because meal wise, I won't order anything else on the menu.  Lastly, the dessert. Ultimate red velvet cheesecake is my go to. It can bring me out of a slump, pick me up if I was down and yea you get the point. They have never messed this one up. This is 5 stars all alone.  The service is always pretty decent, but they really need to stop running out of eggplant parmigiana and stop serving cold bread. I mean seriously, put it in the microwave and warm it up. Laziness got you this 3 star rating from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim
Tim C.,"Los Angeles, CA",665,980,6677,4.0,11/13/2017,"11/08/2017 What are the chances when Annee T. and I come here to get something to eat before heading home. We run into Nate M, Natasha N, and Tien the photographer at our event. We were seated towards the back at a table when Natasha spots us while they are leaving. Such a coincidence to run into them.  When we were ready to order, Annee gets the chopped salad which is really chopped up. I want to get the avocado toast which is fully loaded when it arrives to the table. I was expecting just toast and avocado. There are grape tomatoes cut in half and slices of radishes with long stemmed spinach leaves on top of this thing. Luckily the toast was already cut into slices you can grab so when you cut into the leaves, that's all you need to cut. Is it the seasoning or just the tomatoes were that sweet in each bite I had. I am ordering this next time I need just a snack and not a full meal and hope it's just as tasty as this one order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim
David W.,"Tustin, CA",1,28,32,1.0,12/24/2017,"Thank you for my lump of ice! So it's my birthday I'm sick as a dog and have been stuck in bed all day, all our plans have been canceled and its an all around crappy Christmas eve. Such is life right? My wife wanting me to eat something and trying to cheer me up drove all the way to Anaheim cheese cake factory paid 12 dollars for valet parking and got me a strawberry cheese cake. She patiently waited almost 30 minutes for the cake. It took her over an hour to get home. Wakes me up to have some cake. I was very thankful knowing how far she went out of the way to get it. So she goes to cut it... solid as a rock, it is fresh out of the freezer. WTF who sells a cheese cake right out of the freezer with out at least SAYING something.  If we had been told, we could have had the option to order individual slices. Well now I am up and irritated beyond belief that my wife just wasted all that money and time for something worthless. So I decided I needed to place a call. I asked for the manager. Upon explaining everything he saw nothing wrong with the situation ""oh yeah of course it's frozen, you should have asked for a non frozen one""....

Nicole M.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",56,89,74,3.0,11/9/2017,"Fun atmosphere for Happy hour in the bar area. Got guacamole and chips to start, chose medium which was spicy but we loved it. Huge portion too! We got the orange chicken for dinner..super disappointed. There was hardly any chicken, mostly breading! The flavor was good though. Kinda bummed they didn't offer anything when we complained but glad they were letting the kitchen know because you expect chicken to be in ""orange chicken"". Delicious drinks and cheesecake, service was good too. I'd come back but definitely not order that dish again.

Candace C.,"Sacramento, CA",344,100,236,4.0,12/21/2017,"Always a good time at CCF, this was my first time dining at this location. We ordered the Korean cauliflower (omg!), veggie burgers and fries. The cauliflower y'all, the cauliflower. Order the cauliflower!! Perfect crunchy texture, sweet tangy closer to a hoisin type sauce. Even the non-cauliflower lovers will dig this app. I love cauliflower but you literally can't taste it lol but no complaints here! The CCF veggie burgers are made in house...who knew!? Enlarge my pic and you can literally see the beans and grains of rice inside. It was a huge patty, in fact too heavy and pieces of it fell apart each time we grabbed them to take a bit. I don't recall y'all the ingredients, but I suppose there was no binder (ie egg) to hold the patty together. It was fairly bland, but a little salt and pepper woke up the party. Due to the grains and veggies, CCF got a legit pass on the blandness due to all the goodness in the patty; little salt and pepper did the trick. Since the patty crumbles easily, spiced properly the ""burger"" could be crumbled and served as a meat replacement over pasta with marinara sauce, filler for veggie lasagna, tacos, burritos, or a mock meatloaf. CCF culinary development team, you're welcome for the plug (wink). Our server Andrew was personable, funny, and convinced us to go for the Korean cauliflower as an app. Good call, Andrew!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim

Emil C.,"Irvine, CA",413,1057,4137,4.0,5/29/2017,"It's conveniently located at the Anaheim GardenWalk on Katella Ave just east of Harbor Blvd. My friends and I were in town to run the Tinker Bell half marathon over at Disneyland. It was good enough the first night that we ended up eating here on back to back nights for dinner. If you come here, be sure to save room for some dessert! Also this is a very popular location, so come early and pack your patience! *Cobb salad* This was one of the worst Cobb salads that I've ever eaten anywhere. It didn't even look good. The portion was huge, but that's not a good thing in this case. They did throw in some avocado slices on top, but seriously, order something else! *Lemon meringue cheesecake* Save room for dessert! I'm not a big fan of sweets, but this is one of my favorite flavors for cheesecake. It was awesome! *Crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp* This was on their small special menu. The presentation was good, smelled great, and looked very appetizing. Unfortunately it was a bit too sweet for my taste. All in all it was still not bad. It was super busy both times that we were here, but the service was great both times. Our waiter each time was very friendly and took good care of us. They had no problem splitting the check for us.

Tea C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",329,106,88,4.0,4/21/2017,"The Anaheim GardenWalk is known for being a hub of many restaurants and trending shops. On a corner, there is a lovely restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the one at The Grove, The Americana, and in the Brea area, but... I liked this one a lot. As usual, there was a parking structure nearby, a lovely walking area, and lots of people, but it wasn't overly crowded, especially at the later hour we went! We were, immediately, sat down and waited upon. Our water and bread came quickly, our waiter was very friendly and nice, and we were munching away before we knew it. My date had the Hibachi Steak with fried green beans and mashed potatoes. He added on steamed broccoli, which was also delicious. I had the Farfalle Chicken and pasta and I've never tasted more juicy chicken before. The sauce wasn't overly salty, and the pasta was al dente!  Too stuffed fro dessert, we could only visually pig-out on their new items and many-item menu of desserts. I want to go back and just have dessert next time!! ... And maybe some steak.

Steve A.,"Las Vegas, NV",61,3,2,1.0,9/30/2017,Worst dining experience I've had in a long time at a restaurant! Ive had great experiences with Cheesecake Factory at other locations but DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this location! 1. Ask for no peppers on the item it comes anyways 2. Ask for well done burger and it comes raw! 3. Waitress never came back to table (25min) after it took 30 min to get food. 4. Asked for side of ranch and never got it 5. Sat without a drink for 30 min! I get it if you are busy but at least have the decency to check on the table periodically. I have never complained to a manager at a restaurant and tonight was ridiculously unacceptable!

Tarin C.,"Tracy, CA",44,1,,5.0,12/18/2017,Very delicious! My Boyfriend and I just got into town for our Disneyland trip. We were very hungry I looked up the menu for this place and everything sounded good We got there and boy were they busy. But it was no wait at all it took ten minutes or less to get a table. It was really loud inside so we sat outside witch was perfect for us. The noise volume was way down compared to inside. However that's just my preference some don't care about the noise and some like myself want a little more quiet. The waiter that helped us I sadly don't remember his name was wonderful he took our orders without even writing it down and memorized all of it. He definitely met our needs oh he also checked on us here and there which was perfect. This was a great place to start our vacation in the right way.

Their happy hour is simply AMAZING! A selection of close to $12 appetizers for less than $6 and drink specials! I personally recommend the Avocado Egg Rolls & Potstickers! Last night my bf and I came in after a day at Disney! Our server was named Brooke and was friendly and attentive! We split our favorite pasta, Farfalle with  chicken & roasted garlic, and got two small plates to share! We got the grilled cheese sticks and taquitos! It was all delicious! Our pasta was AMAZING, as it's supposed to be! We've had problems with it at the Brea location on our past two visits there, so we were worried it wouldn't live up to our expectations!

My mom wanted to go sit down somewhere, and I knew at the Cheesecake factory we could find a dish that everyone liked. I was right. When we first got there, the wait looked like it would take hours. They got us in in 5 minutes! They have an extremely diverse menu. Its pages and pages long. For example, I got a dish with ahi tuna, my fiancé got meatloaf, my mom got a greek salad, and my dad got an Asian dish with chicken and rice. It was all really good. We also splurged for the grilled cheese (with truffle?) appetizer. It came with a tomato sauce dip. It was really good! Definitely something you would enjoy for a treat, it was pretty heavy so not something I would want every day.  Our waiter was really friendly, and made us all laugh. If there is such a thing as a professional waiter, he was it! He made jokes about my birthday, and we all had a good time.  We ordered cheesecake for dessert, and since he knew it was my birthday, he put a candle on it, and decorated the plate with some cherry sauce that said ""happy birthday"" and my name. It was such a nice touch! Although I tend to avoid chain restaurants, and usually opt for local ones, this was a very nice place to have my birthday dinner with family.

We got to the restaurant at around 8 o'clock, and it was popping. Took about 15-20 minutes to get seated. Our server, Carnell, honestly made this visit as great as it was. By far the greatest, coolest server I've ever come across! He was very attentive to our needs, full of jokes, and was very engaging. Being the indecisive person I am, Mr. Carnell was very helpful in suggesting both dinner and dessert options. If you ever get this fine man as your server, you are in good hands.  On to the food, I went with a nice rib-eye steak, and it was divine. Grilled just the way I like my steak, and the side of mashed potatoes and beans made for a filling dish.

You can never go wrong with these two choices. Plus, you get unlimited bread! So...why the three stars? Our waiter seemed a little bothered every time we ordered or asked a question. My friend and I only came to order a slice of cheesecake each. Once we told him that we were going to order only cheesecake, he immediately seemed a little displeased. I know it can get stressful serving tables, but we are still paying guest. When we saw him come by the table with bread, we asked, ""Is that bread for us?"" He promptly responded, ""No, this is for another table. I'll bring some later."" It wasn't his response that bothered us, but the way he said it. He kept this attitude this entire evening.

Thi N.,"Garden Grove, CA",92,150,339,5.0,5/7/2017,"Came here last night for our date and had to wait 20' because the line was so long. Food: ***** Ordered rib-eye steak and fish and steak special combination because we wanted to save our stomach for their infamous cheesecake. Meats are very juicy and cooked in a tremendously flavorful sauce, not too greasy hut very appetizing and delicious. Mash potatoes are surprisingly well done.  Got a white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake and gotta say it did lived up to our expectation. This was not some cheesecake you buy at Costco, it was nicely made and had a sweet enough taste. Price: ***** We were happy to spend approximately $70 for the meal since the quality and service were top notch. Did I also mention how big the food portion was? Worth the money Service: ***** The waiter was very attentive and professional, he made sure we were well catered for but not to disturb us at the same time Ambience: ***** Though crowded but the ambience was very formal and cozy, a good place for a date, although it is not recommended for someone who enjoys a quiet dinner",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=20

The location was nice eAsy to find no parking lot of its own there is a parking structure that is free for an hour. $3 for the 2nd hour. Walked in to a beautiful elegant and clean environment. We were seated right away. Felt a little rushed by the waitress when ordering but other than that she was amazing. Attentive and very helpful. Portion size were huge.

John G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",298,401,861,4.0,10/21/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a fun place to go with the family.  In this case, we took our foreign exchange daughter and her friend while we were showing them Disneyland.  The menu is huge (which can be a little overwhelming), but pretty much anything you order is going to be good.  I'm a fan of the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - sort of a sweet and sour, with rice and some peppers.  Tasty! But, of course, the real reason you come is for the cheesecake.  Since it was hard to pick, I suggested that the young ladies go to the showcase to look at the options after they'd studied the menu.  They came back and made their selections (Anniversary Cake and Salted Caramel, I think) - and I split the Godiva Chocolate with my wife.

Zoe F.,"Canoga Park, CA",529,196,66,4.0,6/5/2017,"Never disappointed when I come here, no matter what location.  I always order the mimosa without triple sec, not a huge fan. Had the eggs Benedict, YUM. Their hollandaise sauce is excellent. Not too lemony and no awkward seasonings. Perfect consistency and flavor. The English muffins are toasted to perfection. A little bit of crunch but still soft enough to cut through easily. Adds the right amount of feel to each bite. The potatoes!! In my opinion, they could be a stand alone dish. Comes with a side of ketchup which is just enough considering you don't even need it.  This particular Cheesecake Factory had a very open layout. Huge windows, pretty much floor to ceiling. It was really regressing considering most other ones are more intimate with dim lighting. I quite enjoyed it.

Arrived at the bar really early and sat at the bar as I do per usual, ordered the french toast (as per usual) with a side of chicken chorizo (asked to be served whole, not chopped up) and it was everything i could ask for. I loved how wide open and spread out this Cheesecake Factory is, not as intimate as one is accustomed to. It was so BIG inside i was kinda taken by surprised. I wish CCF took reservations (not that this occasion required a reservation) but I could only imagine the mess this place could be on a Friday night... if the thousand oaks CCF is packed, this one must have a line out the door.

This was really good! Farfalle w/chicken & garlic: Delicious. Highly recommended if you like chicken, pancetta (bacon), mushrooms, and garlic! Sheilas chicken & avocado salad: Great flavor. Tasted like the typical American ""Asian"" salad.  The portions for the Farfelle & salad were generous but the vegetarian pasta was seriously lacking. It was as if we ordered a half portion which was really weird. Also the complimentary bread that came with the meals were really small and hard.

Tasnim C.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,98,93,5.0,3/9/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location is A1! I've been here a total of two times and loved it both times. We just went tonight at around 8 p.m. and it was really busy, but we got seated in about twenty minutes for a party of two. Our server's name was Carnell and right off the bat, he made us laugh. He saw we were kind of just waiting on bread and to get our drinks order taken and got on that ASAP. Throughout the whole night, he was extremely attentive and helpful when we were unsure between a few options. Also really funny and polite. Honestly, I can genuinely say that he was one of the best servers I've ever had. Not just at Cheesecake Factory but overall. He was THAT great. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and really enjoyed it. Carnell said it would be really spicy but it actually was not spicy at all for me. I liked it a lot but I did initially want to ask for fettuccine pasta instead of linguine and forgot. I think the pasta would have been much better with fettuccine but that's just because I like thicker pasta types. For dessert, I got Linda's Fudge Cake and it was delicious. It's always my go-to and I'm never disappointed. Very fudge-y and heavy. I'm overall very satisfied with this dining experience, mainly because of Carnell. Prior to this dining experience, The Cheesecake Factory was always a pretty average dining location. I mean that in terms of the food and whatnot.

She was very humorous and took great care of us! They sang happy birthday to my daughter and things could not have been more sweet. Kerianne was such genuine lady and the warmth she exuded really made my daughter smile.  The food and drinks were excellent. My sweet little girl devoured her bow tie pasta and I ""stole"" one of her delicious corn dogs (when she wasn't looking). I had the fish tacos which were great, and my mom had the omelette with a side of tomatoes. My mom is super picky and the first thing she commented on was the tomatoes and how fresh and juicy they were. My mom also finished every last bite of her omelette so it was obviously quite tasty. We also had peach bellinis and a pineapple mojito which were delicious. We ended our meal with a slice of delightful mango cheesecake. It was quite a treat and I highly recommend it!

And he has to be the best waiter i have came across since dining at cheese cake factory in 2009.  Made sure my cousin and I had everything we needed. Always checked up on us and we sat at the bar where most people think you're not waited on as you do when seating with a larger group. Not the case with Nathan here at this location, a true gem and wonderfully polite young man. He recommended me the Di Pana. I asked for cheese mashed potatoes.. omg such a wonderful Choice. Also they have a cucumber lemonade.. delicious and super refreshing, though it's very sweet for my taste. May want a glass of water next to it! I highly recommend his area to sit in. Tell him want you like and he'll recommend you a great meal+  Message to his management, I've been in customer service for 15 years. He is the best you probably have, show him some love please. What great service and food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=60

Kimberly G.,"Orange, CA",229,61,144,5.0,10/4/2016,"So I came here to celebrate my 4 year anniversary with my boyfriend. My uncle and his fiance recommended me to come here.  As soon as you walk in the decor looks very nice! Loved it !  Had no idea you could walk in to buy cheesecake in the front entrance of the place where there is a little bakery shop sort of thing going on. When it comes to the noise level I'd say it was rather loud in there, maybe because we came on a Sunday?  Anyways we werent big fans of where we got seated because the table was very small but thats not the restaurants fault, we couldve asked to be moved but didnt. The waitress we got was beyond amazing!  She always checked up on us..almost constantly but not too extremely. And would never let my soda go more than half way down when she would come by and take it just to bring me a new full soda! She would take our trash right away and would take our leftovers to box them up and bring them back to us all ready in a bag to go, she definitely exceeded my waitress expectations. Now the menu has so much variety! Takes a lot of time to decide what to get, I would honestly suggest they add photos to their menu, I found myself googling images of their plates to see what I would be getting. I decided on the Madeira Chicken with the Steak Diane. I was pleased with the size of the plates, they were pretty big! My boyfriend ordered the Charbroiled steak which he loved and enjoyed. For dessert we had 2 cheescakes! One was the smores marshmallow w/chocolate cheesecake and Graham crackers, it was good, but i would suggest they add more crackers because the chocolate was just too much to eat by itself, it would make you feel all ""eh"" after a few bites and the marshmallow with crackers would even out the taste,thats until we finished that part. The other cheesecake we ordered to go, didnt eat it til the next day, it was the Kahlua cheescake which was THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER! I would definitely go buy that cheescake again and again! It was just a perfect balance of all the flavors! Loved it! Overall our experience here was very good! We agreed on coming back and its definitely one of my favorite restaurants now!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=60

Rene C.,"Orange, CA",65,104,70,1.0,5/14/2017,"The wait. Not bad. The bar service. Pretty good. Ariel. HORRIBLE. I have experienced good and bad service from servers during my lifetime but tonight was simply horrible. Most servers are either really friendly or they fake it but  at least they try. Our server had the personality of a mannequin.  My friend was the first to point out that Ariel was the first server who did not smile. Don't get me wrong, she was polite but in a unnatural, almost forced manner. It seemed as if she was reading a script to herself and was thinking what a waste of time it was. She took our drink order and when she returned I kindly requested lemon for the water since she forgot to bring it. During our meal, she checked up on us to make sure that our food was to our satisfaction and ask about drink refills but each time it was such a dry and impersonal tone. I don't appreciate fake kindness but I would have felt more comfortable if she had made a little effort to be more human and less robotic. Everyone in our party felt odd when she would speak to us because she didn't seem to be enjoying herself in the least; it was as if she was in some type of physical pain. Very strange.  In the end, she forgot to validate our parking garage ticket so my friend had to pay rather than park the car and walk all the way back to the restaurant. All in all, we were more in disbelief than anything that Ariel was hired to serve patrons and we hope that she finds a new line of work. Or a simple smile would go a long way.

Elizabeth P.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,6,1.0,12/9/2017,The one star is for the food. It was great. Other than that do not order food to go. I called and ordered a pasta and a sandwich. They told me 20 min and It will be ready. I get there 30 min after I order.. still not ready.. 45 min pass I see food go on top of the counter and still haven't heard my named called out like they said they would do. An hour and 15 min go by and I asked how much longer. That bag that was on top of the counter was mine and it's been ready and they never called my name like they said they would. They js expected me to know that that was mine when there were A few people waiting. I was angry with the cashier and all she was doing was being all giggly and flirty with another server. I asked her why she didn't call my name out it's been sitting there and now it's cold. She said it's the managers fault. It doesn't take a manager to call a name out that's been sitting there for 45 min. I spoke the the manager and he was a young guy who didn't care what he was doing. None of these people care about their job. The goal Is the guest experience making people want to come back again. I defiantly do not want to go back here.... another night I came to sit down and eat and the service was pretty basic. Girl was super serious in a monotone voice and hardly came to check on my table. The employees here suck. Cheesecake Factory needs to get thier stuff together and hire better people. After the night with the cashier and my food sitting out for 45 min I will never come to this Cheesecake Factory again and I'll be sure to talk to cheesecake corporate offices bc this Is unacceptable. I understand It can get busy. I don't mind waiting but please next time don't tell me 20 min when it's actually and hour and 15 min with my food sitting there for about 45 min all cold in a paper bag.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=80

Brad C.,"Anaheim, CA",113,2,,5.0,2/8/2017,"It's been my experience that every thing here is good, but sometimes it's the service that makes the restaurant. This afternoon I met up with my best friend for a late lunch. We ordered our favorite small plate to share and she ordered the chicken wraps. I went with our server's (Sabrina) recommendation and had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta. Turned out to be best chicken dish I've ever had, and my bestie ate half! Like I said earlier every thing is good here, but the best part of the experience was indeed the service!  Sabrina is what a business wants and needs in its employees. She is more of an ambassador than server. She maintained a genuine smile the entire time, her recommendations were dead on, and she was effortlessly patient. The best description of how she made us feel was part friend, part family, part VIP.

Jesus R.,"Milpitas, CA",54,19,15,1.0,2/5/2017,"First off I'd like to start by saying that I've been a server so I do know what I'm complaining about.   Second the food wasn't the issue the service was.   We walked in and we were seated within 5 minutes witch is great for a Saturday night so I was excited about that. You never m ow how long you'll have to wait to be seated. So immediately I thought ( great this won't take long ) it was 9pm on Saturday.  We get sat and our server immediately approach the table and told us he'd be right with us. So again I was thinking things are going great, fast to be seated and fast to be greeted.  So when our server returned roughly 5 minutes later we ordered our drinks and a starter. 20 minutes come by and we're still waiting on 1 drink ( hot water ) so finally we get the hot water and no starter. 25 minutes later we get to actually tell our server what we are having for dinner. "" 40 minutes now and finally we get our starter and then 3 minutes later our food. So the timing was pretty off. Not to mentioned out kid was super hungry and received his food 5 minutes after we got ours.  Oh and I forgot to mentioned it was his birthday so he chooses this place . Granted he just turned 9 but it was his choice.  Anyhow 3 out of the 4 dishes came out right but one of them was undercooked so now we're waiting on this to come back and I'm sure you've guessed by now that it took some time. I know this is one of those rants but again I was a server up to last year and I do know how it works and I know it gets busy but I also k ow it's part of the job to have timing down. Our server had a good personality and yes that's part of the job to get better tips but, what's good personality if the service part of your job is off.  Anyhow we just laid the bill and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=80

We didn't wait too long for our table and I think that was the most pleasing part of our experience.   Our food came out in three separate intervals so we did not get the opportunity to eat as a family. My oldest daughters burger was soggy and not warm. Mushrooms burned and she said completely tasteless. The burger was mealy and black. The entire plate of food was not eaten. My youngest had chicken strips that were more like tiny odd shaped chunks/ remnants of what used to be a chicken strip. Tasted strange and rubbery. Also went uneaten. My shrimp and chicken bang bang was underwhelming. Rice super dry, shrimp overcooked. i only found two tiny pieces  of chicken.  Our waitress was a ghost as well... Said absolutely nothing when she saw none of food was eaten just handed the check over which was over $100 with our cheesecake to take home.  Just... Blah. Schmer schmer.  Sooooo super bummed out.

I don't usually leave reviews but I know some restaurants recognize employees and I want to point out one. If I do leave one it's for a good reason.  Waiter was George and he was very charismatic. The bread was cold but that probably wasn't his fault. I ordered the chicken Marsala, my wife had the Steak Diane, I think my daughter had fish and chips. The food took a while to get out to the table.  We were very close to leaving. When we did get it though it satisfied us and was pretty good. The steak was a bit tough. Chicken was just a little too dry. It was a good meal regardless. Didn't get any cheesecake at the table But As we were leaving we turned the corner and Terra from the cheesecake station was hustling with dishes then stopped and elegantly moved to the side for us to pass and nodded with a very bright smile. She was the only person besides our waiter to smile and we knew our waiter just wanted tips. My wife asked her for her name and even had a conversation with her about how she likes working there and my wife can tell she cares about making the guest feel good. Subtle acts of kindness make a huge impact. If it weren't for Terra in the Cheesecake section this review wouldn't have gotten the fourth star.

Lesley C.,"West Covina, CA",422,521,24,4.0,7/4/2016,"My friend was staying at Anaheim Marriott nearby, so we decided to have dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. She's in town here and there as she's a flight attendant. She thoroughly enjoyed her last visit here, and didn't really want to try anything new.  There is a parking structure for this plaza, but make sure to get your ticket validated at the restaurants where you dine! Avocado Eggrolls (Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce.) Garlic Noodles (Spaghettini, Fresh Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Oven-Roasted Tomatoes and Parmesan in a Delicious Garlic Sauce. Available with Chicken or Shrimp.) Teriyaki Chicken (Chicken Breast Charbroiled with Teriyaki Sauce, Served with Steamed Rice.) FREE - Caesar Salad (The Almost Traditional Recipe with Croutons, Parmesan Cheese and Our Special Caesar Dressing. Available with Chicken.) TO GO - Louisiana Chicken Pasta (Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce.) This location does get busy due to the nearness of hotels and Disneyland but we were seated promptly when we arrived around 8 pm on a Thursday night. I have a few dishes that I always order when I visit any Cheesecake Factory, and that is the Avocado Eggrolls and the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Never can go wrong with these two. Service was quite slow and we were starving. Once we were seated, we were looking for our server as we wanted to order right away. Took awhile, but we were finally able to order. We told the server that all the food could be brought out all together, no need for the appetizer to come first and then the entrees. So happy that they still serve the honey wheat and french bread with butter. So delicious! The manager did end up stopping by our table, during our meal, to let us know that the chef didn't approve of the Garlic Noodles dish they made and wanted to remake it. The manager wanted to apologize and give us an option of free soup or free salad. We totally were not expecting that level of service and was pleasantly surprised. We opted for the Caesar Salad.  My friend decided upon the Garlic Noodles and the Teriyaki Chicken. Both dishes were a first for me and I did enjoy the Garlic Noodles. The only thing that I did not enjoy about the Noodles was the Asparagus. It was not fresh at all. The stalk was so thick and dry that I was surprised the chef approved this 2nd plate for us to eat. It was like chewing gum. The Teriyaki Chicken was too sweet for my taste and the rice horrible, but my friend enjoyed this dish. Personally, I would not order Asian food at an American restaurant but everyone has different tastes. Since I was here and didn't get to eat my favorite, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, so I decided to order it to-go. Because how can I not? The portion was quite decent and the prices of all the dishes are always decently priced. Overall, my expectations of the food are up to what I expect from any Cheesecake Factory location. The parking structure was a bit of an inconvenience. The parking spots are a bit tight, so be careful of the cars next to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=100

The line may appear long from the outside, but often it's not all that bad. Make your way to the hostess table, and check before counting this place out. Often times there are big groups that just can't be seated as quickly, so they all converge outside.  The menu is awesomely huge, so there is something for everyone! I love the macaroni and cheese ball appetizer and even better is the macaroni and cheese ball burger... divine!!

Lynn N.,"Anaheim, CA",1,28,28,2.0,1/24/2017,"Went here at around 8pm on a weekday. I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in such a long time and was prepared for a hefty tab between my bf and I. We got seated within 5 minutes of walking in. What sucked was the host took us to our seat, which hadn't been cleaned up so he tried to walk us back towards the front again, only to have someone else tell him to seat us next to the seats that were being cleaned up. That new spot was tiny! We aren't big people but it was uncomfortable with very little space for anything. The utensils and napkins took up 70% of the table space already.  My bf was already not in a good mood because of the seating issue already but I tried to make the best of it. Took around 10 minutes for our waitress to come by and took her another 10 minutes to drop off our water. My bf's water was dirty but since she walked away we couldn't stop her fast enough to ask for a new one. He ended up not drinking water during our dinner :/  I ordered the pasta carbonara and my bf had the Cajun jambalaya pasta. I enjoyed my pasta carbonara (no meat) and my bf was indifferent with his jambalaya. For how much food we received, the bill was close to $40, which I think was overly priced. The service was what kind of affected us and made the visit unpleasant for us. We knew walking in that the food would be pricey so we were prepared for that, but when you receive terrible customer service, it's hard to enjoy your food.

This review is solely based on the items I ordered. Korean cauliflower - 5* - new menu item, I forgot if that was the whole name. Could have been Korean fried cauliflower? Anyways, the sauce it was marinated in was really good. It didn't even taste like I was eating a vegetable. 10/10 would recommend. Ribeye steak - 2* - by no means am I a steak snob, but I've had my fair share of ribeyes from plenty of different restaurants. I've even ordered the ribeye in the past @ the Cerritos location & I would give that a 4* rating. However, this location's ribeye (the one I was served anyways) only deserves 2*. It was definitely the chewiest steak I've ever had the displeasure of eating. I'm pretty sure the cut itself was wrong, because it was very difficult to slice through. I was pretty disappointed because that was my cheat meal :( Although the mashed potatoes and broccoli it came with were both good. I would not recommend. Bloody Mary - 4* - I looove bloody mary's & the mix they use is pretty tasty! Recommend.

Mary P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",126,75,41,1.0,3/1/2017,"Health hazard! Had some appetizers at the bar and ordered two entrees to go. The servers at the bar were attentive enough and the food came out quickly. When I got home to eat my entree, I took a bite of my steak medallions and almost choked on what I thought was a super tough and rubbery piece of meat. It wasn't meat. It was a rubberband and it smelled as though it had gone through the cooking process with the rest of the dish because after smelling the dish more closely, it has a slight chemical smell. Aside from that, the noodles on the other entree I ordered to go were extremely overdone, to the point that they were slightly mushy. I called the restaurant right away and asked to speak to a Manager. She was apologetic and took the meat dish off my check. Seemed like some pretty careless (and potentially hazardous) mistakes in the kitchen on that particular day. Not at all what I would expect from a huge chain like The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=100

If I was the manager I would be blessed knowing I had someone like him working for me and attending to my customers. Very sweet and attentive. Defiantly made our experience and our night fun.

I went yesterday evening with some family and left CCF very disappointed. My crispy chicken sandwich had the option of either chipotle or buffalo sauce, so I went with buffalo. My sandwich had a smidge of sauce on it, but that wasn't the kicker. The lettuce on the side of my plate that's supposed to go on my sandwich was wilted and had bronze tint. The side salad that came with my meal was covered in dressing and already wilted when it reached my table AND some of the lettuce was bronze tinted as well. My daughter's ""fruit cup"" had wilted blueberries, discolored pineapples, squished grapes, and old, tired strawberries. To top it off, my niece ordered buffalo wings and the celery had a hair on it! I didn't send the food back in fear that the kitchen staff would do something disturbing to my new order.

I have once again walked into The Cheesecake Factory. i was expecting it to be a little more nuts here being so close to Disneyland, but we had a great experience.  We had a group of 9 so we had to wait about 15 minutes for tables to be cleared. Not bad for TCF. Time waiting can always be entertained by gazing into the glass case of cheesecakes at the front. Deciding which delicious cake to have it definitely a tough choice - they all look so incredible! Service was excellent. Melissa our lead server was amazing. She got all our orders up quickly, kept the drinks filled. We got our bread and our oh by the way I need this added with no problems. After she even noticed our large group and volunteered to split up the check if needed. Wow. Usually you have to ask and then get the sigh from the server, but again she was very accommodating. She asked for our parking ticket too for validation.  The food was awesome as usual. I split mine with a friend because the portions are sooo huge and you do want to save room for some cheesecake. Turkey club was my choice this time around. Other ordered burgers and pasta dishes which looked fantastic. One of my absolute favorites is the buffalo blasts. OMG these are the best!!!!! They also have a full bar and great drink list. Only 3 beers on tap tho.  After filling our pie holes - we ordered up the cheese cakes. Got them in to go boxes so we could get our fill and be ready to take the rest to go.

Russell S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",11,89,16,4.0,11/16/2016,"While in town for a conference, my coworkers and I decided to hit up Cheesecake Factory for dinner. The convention center is located in the Disneyland bubble with few food choices other than the large chains.  We had meals at two higher-end steakhouses, but to be honest, my favorite meal during the trip was here.   Our wait time was only 10 minutes, which is rare for this restaurant as I'm used to waiting 30-60 minutes for a table. Our server was excellent, probably the best I have encountered at any of the Cheesecake Factories I have been to. He was consistently helpful, refilled our waters promptly, and generally seemed to care that we had a good time. I didn't catch his name,  but he had a mini man bun about the size of a golf ball. I'm used to rushed servers trying to manage the hordes of patrons commonly found here.  For dinner, I had a dirty martini, fish n' chips, and a slice of Reece's peanut butter cup cheesecake for dessert. The fish was tender, which was quite refreshing as my other seafood meals during the trip were tough and rubbery. Despite being very hungry, I couldn't finish everything, which is a trademark of the huge servings here.  The martini helped me relax from the long day of sitting in uncomfortable conference chairs and we enjoyed our cheesecake back at the hotel.  Overall, it was a refreshing meal that reminded me of why this restaurant is consistently packed.

The waitress didn't even apologize, she just said ""I'll bring a new one"". A while after we placed our order, I still hadn't gotten a new water. When the food was brought out, the waitress had messed up one of the orders by bringing in the wrong side - that was corrected and honestly not a big deal. Everyone got their food but mine was no where. When the waitress came back out she said she'd check on it. Before I knew it the manager was at our table apologizing and asking if I would like something while I wait. They never told me what happened but I had a feeling it was going to take a while. I imagine they forgot to place the order. By the time I got my food I was the only one at the table eating. To make matters worse, when I got home I discovered I had chocolate ALL OVER the back of my pant legs from sitting in it at the restaurant. I am not pleased.

Well after the long wait to be seated Guess what? Yep their food was WRONG! Shortly after the manger came out with the last two plates, and when he heard the food was not right, he gave the waiter the plates & simply walked away!! didn't come back! Then the waiter suggested to my boss to switch plates with his daughter?  When she already has started eating it!! This crew was truly Unbelievable I was dumbfounded by their clumsiness!  Yea that Luis manager never came back to apologize at least!! FOOD: was tasty can't complain about it! Portions were filling, but after the way we were treated , no one was able to enjoy the food. It was all bagged to Go At the end we ended up leaving our table & looking for a manager, since he never came back!  We explained to her our ordeals  since we walked in to that place! She was kind enough to deduct some items from the bill. Honestly I personally wouldn't of paid .  Bottom line this place cannot handle big groups with that mediocre customer service/management they have!!  I will be calling their general manager to complain!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=160
J. A.,"Anaheim, CA",67,17,38,5.0,6/11/2017,"This is my favorite restaurant if you are looking for some Cajun and pasta both savory flavors in one bite. This cheesecake factory is located near Disneyland but despite the bussy surroundings service here is quick. I came in with my husband on a Friday night like at 10 and there was only a 15 minute wait and we sat down in a booth quickly.  This restaurant can be for a casual occasion, night out for drinks, or just because. Our server was Elizabeth​/Lizzy , she was great. Lizzy recommended the Cajun  jambalaya pasta and the shrimp scampi. We ended up ordering that and we are glad we did. The Cajun jambalaya was spicy and flavorful. The portion is large and well worth the the price. My husbands shrimp scampi was a smaller portion but very good as well. When it came to drinks I was undecided between a blood ornage margarita and a passion fruit, again Lizzy explained each drink and differences. Throughout the entire dinner she was attentive and we appreciated her menu knowledge. Food was delicious and drinks were to die for.   We will definitely be telling others of our service here and great food . Last but not least I would like to thank Sean ( manager ) for assisting me over the phone with a question I had. He was patient and went out of his way to help me out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=160

Jaime W.,"Tustin, CA",65,147,405,1.0,7/2/2016,"Absolutely the worst experience of my life. I realize that this location is busy (all of them are) because it's smack in the middle of Disneyland central but to me that means you should have a better wait staff.  We were basically held hostage by our spectacular waiter, the guy has no business being a waiter or in any occupation that requires time management skills or people skills. I'd hate to see what that wait would be on a Saturday, we went on Wednesday.  Number of refills received at our table - 1, we had to flag someone down that wasn't our server. Number of minutes the waiter took to come back to our table to get drink orders after dropping off bread - 25 - waiter vanishes Number of minutes it took to get our drinks - 20 to 30 waiter vanishes  Number of minutes it took our waiter to come back and take our order after dropping off drinks - 25 - waiter vanishes  Number of minutes it took to get our food 45 normal for the amount of people but we didn't see our waiter for another 30 after that.  I dunno we would like refills now. No, no sign of anyone. Awesome we will all suck on the ice cubes. 15 minutes after the last appearance of our waiter, he pops back up and we ask for boxes. You would think we asked for his right arm based on his craptastic attitude. Sorry you have to do your job. Number of minutes until he returns - 25, again seriously WTF. Also all food is shoved in one bag for a party of 7 then says ""oh you didn't come together"". Asks if we want dessert- HUGE mistake. So refills...anyone...anyone..hey you random employee can we get refills now that our meal is over?!? Number of minutes it takes to get menus - 20 Number of eye rolls from the waiter when I ask for my cheesecake to go - 1 huge one. Maybe if you didn't take your sweet ass time I would have eaten it there but I really was ready to leave. Number of minutes to get cheesecake - 30....did he bake all them himself?? Number of minutes to get bill after cheesecake is dropped off - 28 This waiter could not be bothered with passing out drinks, he stopped at the first person at the table and stacked them all. He could not be bothered with picking up plates or even attempting to reach to get them, we all had to pick up the plates and pass them to him and when he brought the cheesecake he did the same thing.  No one bothers to offer refills, collect dirty used bread plates, check to see if anything was needed - you know all the basic restaurant industry skills. This was a sad day for The Cheesecake Factory, most likely will not be returning to this location unless I want hours of my life taken away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=160

However, I have to say on this occasion what let the Cheesecake Factory down was the evening staff on the reception counter. We came in and asked for a table for 7 people. We were told it would be 30 minutes which wasn't a worry. One hour later I had to start demanding to see managers and for 20 minutes I was told ""you are next"" as I watched new arrival after new arrival just walk in past us - one of which was a party of 10 people. I don't mind waiting and don't mind if a person tells me there are people in front of me, but there was obviously favouritism going on whether that be tips being handed over or something else. As soon as I started raising my voice, magically a table appeared. If you want great food this is definitely a great place and the table service I have always received here has been fantastic, but the attitude and the poor behaviour of the front reception staff can put a real sour taste on what would be an otherwise great night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=160

Kat D.,"Pittsburg, CA",53,270,62,1.0,12/26/2015,"Let me start my review by saying that the food itself was very delicious. The service however was sub-par. We arrived pretty late when it comes to dinner. We arrived at 9pm.  We decided to sit at the bar because we wouldn't have to wait. The server was very nice. Made us some drinks that were off the menu. That was very nice of him. Here's where he messed up. Twenty minutes after taking our order, he comes to our table and asks us ""did you guys order""? um why yes, yes we did.  Another twenty five minutes later and we are still sitting there, waiting to be served. ( the waiter comes back and tells us that the chef over cooked the steak and they are making another on the fly. ) We had just spent the day at Disneyland and we were very hungry. My companion suggested that we pay our bill for our drinks and go to the room for a popcorn dinner.  I proceeded to the front and asked for a manager. I let the manager know that it had been 45 minutes and we just wanted to pay our bill and leave. He was very helpful and kind. I didn't complain to have any ill feelings. I just expressed our desire to pay our bill and leave.  The manager got us served in a few minutes. He let us know that the server forgot to put in our order. Here's what irritates me. I was lied to by our server and on top of waiting 45 minutes to be served, he didn't offer to take one single thing off the bill. I mean not even a piece of cheesecake.  I still left a tip. I know how important they are to servers. But I wish I didn't.  Good food. Terrible service. We went to IHOP the next morning, and couldn't help notice how much better the service was.

I've come to the Cheesecake Factory many of times over the years and still cannot call off a single dish that I'd highly recommend. All choices I've made have been OK at best. Not bad but not great either. I also believe that the prices are a bit steep. A snack from the snack menu, an appetizer, two pastas, and two slices of cheese cake came up to $79...that's steep. I don't mind spending but it has to be worth it! On the upside...the portions of most of the pastas are large and the cheesecakes are delicious (As they should be for the restaurants name sake).  I know of many people who really enjoy this place but as I stated, I've yet to find a dish here that completely wows me.

Brianna G.,"Chula Vista, CA",55,1,,1.0,10/16/2017,"I don't like leaving bad reviews, but this place was the worst. I had been trying to place an order for over an hour through postmates so our hungry kids could eat once we got to the hotel room from a 14 hour day in Disneyland. They were tired and hungry and the first order was placed an hour and a half before this place was suppose to close. The order was simple and through this app it tells you what the restaurant has listed as currently unavalible so we figured our order would be fine. My phone dies on the ride and the order was cancelled due to our inability to make a substitution. Okay that's our bad. So we place the order again this time we see one item in our order was marked as unavailable. Another 10 minutes goes by and the app notifies us another item in our order needs to be replaced so we change it, nope cheesecake informs postmates again that they can't fill our order. I order it one final time and within five minutes we are cancelled. I call the establishment at 1030pm, they close at 11pm, to see what is going on and am put on hold for 15minutes waiting for the cashier to pick up as she's handling takeout orders. I finally get her and ask what's going on and am met with a bad attitude and am being told that they can't make a cheese burger because they are out of kobe beef. They can't make any burgers if they are out of kobe beef mind you. So why wasn't the burgers marked as unavailable like every other unavailable item for the past hour and a half??? This led to the kids being forced to eat what snacks we had left from the park as they could barely keep their eyes opened! And the adults had to spend an hour and a half wasting time waiting for an order that was never even give to the kitchen!

Jackie W.,"Orange, CA",225,433,244,4.0,2/25/2016,"If their what seems like 40 page menu isn't enough to pull you in, then their delectable selection of cheesecake definitely should be. It's called The Cheesecake Factory after all.  This place always seems to be busy which is a testament to its popularity. Once you can narrow down your meal choices, the food is almost always good. From the Fried Mac and Cheese Balls to their giant salads and bowls of pasta, it's all yummy. On this particular visit, I went with the Chipotle Chicken Pasta, the perfect blend of spice, flavor, chicken and veggies. Plus I had plenty to take home for leftovers! I paired it with an Arnold Palmer (I love any place that serves these) and followed it up with the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake which is quite possibly my favorite sit down restaurant dessert ever.  The bigger portion sizes always equals a slightly heftier price tag. I think I spent almost $40 (including tax and tip) on the above but considering the pasta lasted me another meal and the cheesecake I nibbled on for several days after, it evens out. And you can tailor what your order to your price point by ordering smaller plates, getting water, etc.  The service was great. We actually ended up with 2 servers because we had a friend who joined us much much later and our previous server was no longer working. But one of the other servers very nicely took over our table and was super friendly. Make sure to get your parking validated. Your server can actually do it for you here so you can get your 3 hours free parking in the maze that is the GardenWalk parking structure.  My only complaint was when I arrived and asked if I could check in without my whole party there, the hostess said I could be seated without them. But when they called my name and they saw it was just me, they wouldn't let me be seated and put our reservation 'on hold' until everyone else was there which is fine, but need to give your customers the right information.

But it just so happens that I got a nice sized gift card to The Cheesecake Factory over the holidays and found myself dining here this past weekend and I have to give credit where it is due. There was a horrendous wait for a Saturday night dinner but luckily, I had no problem dining outside which meant immediate seating... yay! To start, I ordered an app that had three fried items - avocado, mushrooms, and zucchini. After eating this, I have come to the conclusion that avocado should not ever meet the fryer, it just doesn't have the right taste. Loved the two sauces that came with this. Oh, did I mention this app was on the house--I told our server that they didn't bring our app out before the entrees so he apologized, looked into it, and brought it right out and said it is comped. Wow- this made me remember your name Garrett! For my entree, I had their miso salmon. It is served on a bed of rice and there are a few sugar snap peas. This was a very generous sized portion of salmon and I loved the taste of the sauce. I only wish there was more vegetables in this dish to balance it out, but I had no other complaints about my entree. Quite frankly, I was shocked. To finish off my meal, I shared a red velvet cheesecake. This dessert was not high on the sweet meter which made it a perfect way to end the meal. There are so many cheesecakes to choose from. All in all, it was a very positive experience here and makes me feel like perhaps I shouldn't be discriminating against these chains because apparently, this one is doing it all right.

Jessica T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",1206,124,1387,4.0,1/18/2016,"Came in to get some quick to go dessert! So just short and sweet review regarding the food since I didn't get to experience service or ambiance of the restaurant. My boyfriend and I got two cheesecakes to go! It felt like an indulgent night. There were so many delicious looking cheesecakes to choose from, it was seriously a struggle. My boyfriend decided on the dulce de leches cheesecake and since he chose such a sugar loaded cheesecake, I went with the lemon meringue cheesecake to add a little tartness to our palette!  There were both melt in your mouth delicious. Nothing less than what we had already expected. Seriously it just melts in your mouth. I believe they take it out to let it thaw a bit before packaging it to go, because it didn't feel like it just came from the fridge! We were going to eat it when we got home, but of course we snuck a bite when we got to the car, and it was fully thawed.  We got home and threw it in the freezer for about an hour. Personally I like my cheesecake more firm, and damn it did it justice for sure. The cheesecake had a great texture after being in the freezer for a little time. It was creamy enough to melt in your mouth but not too soft like straight up eating cream. The heat from your mouth melts it, and it is bomb. The lemon meringue suited my taste buds more and my boyfriend liked his better. I thought the Dulces de leches was a bit too sweet, it has a similar taste to caramel, and it has an extremely heavy and rich taste to it. I loved the lemon meringue, it was tart and not overly sweet.  I'm excited to try other ones in the future!

We placed our orders and got our drinks.  I told the server that i wanted another margarita to arrive with my meal.  Our meals arrived i figured it might be a couple of minutes for my drink, half way thru my meal the server came back and said should be a couple more minutes, the drink finally showed up after I was done eating.  So I sent it back, as I wanted to have it with my food not dessert.  Not great service, half the time you don't even see your server.  However the food was great, just service is lacking.  You would think that being outside a major theme park they would step it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=140
Junior B.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,4.0,6/27/2017,"Came here with a party of eight and the staff were very friendly and on their game. The restaurant is VERY BUSY and part of my experience was watching the waiting staff hustle to fulfill the demand. It is a good idea to make a reservation ahead of time if you don't want to wait 30 min plus for seating. My only complaint, and this is more of a personal preference, is that my steak was a little on the overcooked and dry side - still edible though. The rest of the family loved their food.

Aman S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,7,6,5.0,3/4/2016,"I don't usually go to this location because it's quite a drive but it was a special occasion so I went. My friend had her birthday party here so it was quite a large group, about 15 people or so. Despite the fact that we were a large group our service was EXCELLENT. I mean really I was impressed. At some points our waitress' attitude was a little off but I know how hard serving a huge group of high school/college kids can be so I honestly did not have that much of a problem with it. We did not have to wait long to be seated once our whole party had arrived and our drink orders were taken within five minutes. They split the checks individually for us at the end as well without any trouble.  As for the meal, I thought it was excellent. I ordered garlic noodles with shrimp and it was amazing. It was my first time trying the dish and I really enjoyed it. The sauce was excellent and the flavor all around was excellent. It could've used a bigger ratio of shrimp to everything else however.

Fufu M.,"Orange, CA",2,41,17,2.0,3/21/2017,"The only reason we've ever went to a CF is bc we've been given gift cards for this place twice and both times we've been unimpressed with the food and the atmosphere. The food ranges from gross to average. It is overpriced for how mediocre the food is. The atmosphere is way too loud. It like they didn't consider anything in their design to absorb how the noise carries across the restaurant. I couldn't even hear my server, but considering that he sounded like he had a mouthful of marbles, it didn't help the situation. I left feeling disappointed and frustrated, vowing never to return and hoping I'd never have to.

Hieu N.,"Santa Ana, CA",275,85,1278,4.0,9/29/2015,"With so many items on the menu from Asian to Mexican to Italian to American, you'd think that there's no way the food can be top notch. I mean other than the cheesecake, which is phenomenal, how can any one of their dishes really be specialized? All that being said, I'm pleasantly surprised every time I come. Here's a few of my favorites: Seared Ahi Roll - RIP. Sadly they've taken this item off the menu. But I just wouldn't feel right not writing about this dish, because it was easily one of our favorite dishes here. We always ordered one for the table as an appetizer. The tuna was always fresh, and the roll lightly fried to perfection. It sat on top of a bed of crispy white noodles and was finished with scallions, a rich creamy sauce, and a light and slightly sweet ponzu. CF please bring this back! Steaks Diane - Hands down my favorite dish here. The medallions of steak are always cooked to the perfect temperature, and are always melt in your mouth tender. I have to shamelessly admit that I absolutely love A-1 and ask for it no matter where I get my steaks. However, the sauce that makes this dish is so rich and flavorful, I find myself using A-1 every so slightly. You can't forget about the mushrooms in the sauce either; with the sauce, it makes the perfect companion for the mashed potatoes. Jambalaya - I usually get this dish with rice, but you can also get it with noodles. I love Cajun food and this dish surprisingly hits the spot when I'm craving that southern flavor. It's got a nice spice, and with an abundance of chicken, shrimp, and andouille, I find myself only ever finishing half. Few disappointing notes - The cocktails left me wanting more. The pineapple Moscow mule was flat. I craved that crisp ginger beer that makes the drink so refreshing. The peach mint julep was difficult to drink. The chunks of peach are appreciated, but with the crushed ice and the mint, it was impossible to drink through a straw. It wasn't any easier to drink straight out of a narrow-mouthed chalice either. Margaritas, mojitos, and martinis are a little too sweet for my liking. With most cocktails ranging from $10-12, I'll stick to the food unless it's happy hour.  Tips - Get their complimentary bread basket. The squaw bread never lasts longer than 2 minutes at our table. They've got a really good happy hour M-F 4-6 with drinks and appetizers starting at $5. Lastly, the service is always top notch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=180

Our server Darius (I think was his name or Darell) was honestly the best server we've ever had at any restaurant we've ever been to. He was so happy and funny, great personality, honestly think he should be working at disney he was such a happy guy. We've been to cheesecake factory a bunch of times so we have our regular dishes and know what we like. Reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of him, the only reason I took one star off because even though he was great he was talking to other tables so much that it was taking him a long time to get back to us with drinks and to take orders. He seems to love his job and is a pro as he didn't write anything down for our table and the table next to us and got both orders correct. He noticed I was wearing a disney birthday button and at the end of the meal brought me a little something and sang me a beautiful rendition of happy birthday.

Justin B.,"Livermore, CA",1557,258,124,4.0,5/11/2016,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. Matter of fact, I am addicted to the Sante Fe Chicken Salad that they have!  While down at Disneyland for the run, we wanted to go to a place close to our hotel that wasn't at Disneyland to try and get away from the crowd.  We decided to walk around the corner to the GardenWalk and see what was going on over there. At 5:15 on a Friday night there was no one to be found. I hate to admit this, but after being at Disneyland all day it was nice to be in an area with NO ONE.  We walked up for dinner expecting to wait, and we got seated right away. It blew us away. Never before at ANY Cheesecake Factory have we not had to wait. Even in Pleasanton during the work week you can wait 20 minutes.  A must get cheesecake is: Salted Caramel. It is to die for. If you are even the slightest of caramel fan, you have to get it. It is a good thing our hotel had a mini fridge. I got to snack on that for the next few days!

I got the grilled salmon and salad as a more healthier option to what was on their extensive menu. The salmon was amazing as well the assortment of greens and vegetables it came with. My mother got the grilled chicken tacos which instead of a taco shell came served in a lettuce leaf. They were absolutely delicious (I tried one myself) and a great healthy option at $6.95.  Then we got onto ordering desserts. Easily one of the best desserts I've ever tried. The Oreo cheesecake slice we got between the 3 of us (easily a shareable portion size) was absolutely incredible. It had visible whole Oreos right in the middle of the slice! It was served with cream and covered in Oreo pieces as well as topped with a large Oreo cookie!

It comes with either brown or white rice. The meal was rich, tender, flavorful, and just absolutely amazing. It has the perfect level of sweetness and softness that just melts in your mouth. The mixture of flavors literally just bursts in your mouth!! As for drinks, mango margarita is super good. Tasted like they used real mangos and you can barely even taste the alcohol.

For dessert, (all you chocolate lovers) Godiva chocolate cheesecake with whipped cream! :) Service: The staff was really friendly and were pretty quick with their service.

The manager did take our order and the food came quickly. Once our whole party was there and ordered, it literally took almost half an hour for our food to come. While waiting the manager came and let us know that the kitchen was backed up and thats why the food was taking so long. When our food finally did come my plate was missing. Our waiter then asked if the manager advised that my order was dropped. The food was really good. I am just very surprised that even though i couldnt eat with my family they did nothing to compensate for this (10% of the meal, free dessert, etc.) I will think twice about eating here  again.

Viv S.,"Corona, CA",9,73,65,5.0,5/12/2015,"This location is by far the best yet! I've patronized it many times, most of which have been for large parties. Girls Nite, Graduation Luncheons, Birthdays, and most recently for a surprise Mother's Day dinner. The service each and every time has been impeccable. Every server has displayed top notch customer service and even with larger parties we have never had an unreasonable wait time. When making the reservation they are very specific with letting us know that after 10 minutes they can no longer hold the extra seats. This has worked out well every time as I usually tell my group 15 minutes earlier to keep us all on point and allow for parking delays. My most recent visit was a surprise for myself and friends. Our husband's hosted a surprise Mother's Day dinner. We dined on the outside patio and the tables were complimented with roses. Simply beautiful! Our main server was Miguel and he was awesome! All the staff was great. Miguel simply stood out because he was so friendly and we loved his accent. He could upsell us anything. Lol!  Since this location is in a busy area surrounded by Disneyland and Angel's Stadium, the traffic is non-stop. Nonetheless once you are seated, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference because the service is prompt and accurate. Can't wait to go back.

Chris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3238,810,14322,4.0,1/10/2015,"If you've ever seen the comic strip featuring Garfield, created by Jim Davis, that's one cat that I can definitely relate to. This orange colored feline has personality, with a clear disdain for doing work and Mondays, being lazy, sarcastic, a bit obnoxious, hating diets, along with abusing Odie the dog and his geeky owner Jon. Despite, his faults, he surely has a softer side for his teddy bear Pooky, sleeping, and most of all FOOD. It's no secret that he loves pasta, pizza, and Italian cuisine. Not to mention the occasional house plant. Now the Cheesecake Factory doesn't serve any shrubs or ferns in their salads, but I think Garfield would be a fan of this restaurant chain, including me. The service and vibe of each location can be slightly different, but I've never had any issues at this Anaheim GardenWalk location. Out of all the times I've dined in, I can't remember a bad experience. Like many of you, I can somewhat deal with the issues if the food is to my liking and that's the case here. CHICKEN MADEIRA It's their most popular chicken dish. I get sucked in almost every visit, ordering this specialty item 95% of the time. Sautéed Chicken Breast topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and served with a mound of Mashed Potatoes. I coat the white bread with butter and dip it into the mushroom sauce. It should be illegal to have this much fun. BISTRO SHRIMP PASTA My favorite pasta dish here. Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil Garlic Lemon Cream Sauce. Never a dull moment when I order this. Hearty and fulfilling, it puts a grin on my face, with a garlicky breath that would make any Korean proud. You honestly can't leave here without some form of cheesecake. Defeats the entire purpose of dining at a location where their distinctive feature matches the name of the establishment. My recommendation? The classic Strawberry Cheesecake. Sorry my friends, I don't care to share and neither should you. WORDS TO LIVE BY ""I'm not mad at you, I'm just not dealing with you and your drama anymore.""

As for the food I ordered the meat loaf and it was awesome.  It was seasoned and cooked properly.  The gravy was on point, as was the succotash that complimented it.  My only complaint was the mashed potatoes.  They were a bit dry and not as creamy.   The portions where large, I should have shared the plate with my son, thus not leaving me any room for desert.  Until next time, I will have to try the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=240

Javier H.,"Anaheim, CA",6,9,,1.0,2/15/2016,"So we had the best waiting staff ever, she was absolutely polite, easy going and attentive to our every need. My 1 star review is for the kitchen, food and management.  - I happen to order the easiest plate on their 10 page menu which was spaghetti and meatballs with extra meatballs (lunch portion), easy right????! Wrong!!!  -On the first attempt I get cold tomato sauce over my 4 meatballs so I kindly asked that it be put under the broiler for a few minutes to be heated up, they take it upon themselves to redo my order.  -On the second attempt they bring out the lunch portion of my dish with only 1 meatball, so I kindly ask the server that I had ordered extra meatballs, again they chose to take my plate and make it again. -On the third attempt I get what I ordered, hot  spaghetti and 4 meatballs. So I dig in, the noodles and sauce are spot on, I cut into the meatball and it's as if I ordered ground beef tartare, medium rare on a meatball is not desirable or appetizing. So I kindly tell my waitress my problem and ask that my order gets canceled. -Management made no attempt to rectify or compensate me for this health hazard and for the fact that I ended up not eating because I don't like raw ground beef, all I got was a ""we are very sorry"" and walked away. I am sorry I didn't bring a party of 8 to your establishment to get a sorry when you can't get spaghetti and meatballs right.

Alicia H.,"Santa Ana, CA",905,107,153,3.0,12/16/2014,"I've visited this Cheesecake factory locations quite a few times already. More recently, I went around 6pm and didnt need to wait long for a booth. Cheesecake factory definitely has nice ambiance but theres something about it that still errks me. Ah ha! It's the service and the servers. They don't smile much and they're always too much in a rush to stop and see you tryna flag them down. At least at this location. They're not as attentive and cordial as I would like. So I ordered the Steak Diane + Shrimp Scampi combo for about $20. This came with 3 measly pieces of big fried shrimp and a few small pieces of steak topped with onion and mushroom. The sauce it was marinated in was too sweet and oily. It just didn't really appeal to me and wasn't as good as I thought it would be for that price! My friend ordered the Kobe burger which came with a tiny basket of fries. Being a frequent eater of Kobe, my friend could tell immediately that they had not served him kobe. Our server called upon some random girl, not even dressed or looking like she worked there who came out to talk to us about the burger. She kindly agreed to re-make the burger (which I thought was the right move and good customer service) and they quickly brought out another. This time according to my friend, was in fact real kobe. My friend enjoyed the burger and I thought my plate was so so.  I also had 2 glasses of Merlot, 14 hands for $9/glass - now that I think about it I should have just ordered a bottle with that money. My friend ordered 3 Blue Moons and we shared a Pina Colada at the end. The bill came out to $95. This felt very overpriced or maybe it's just inflation. Overall, the quality of the food was just okay and our server wasn't very friendly at all. She hardly checked on us and if it weren't for the lady who came out and re-made our burger, we would have left feeling disappointed. Honestly, the only thing nice about this place is the lighting. Even the water mugs that appear to be glass but aren't, aren't pretty, they're dingy and plastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=240
Andrea R.,"Orange, CA",853,205,778,3.0,11/4/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is huge in size, big in portions, but dwindles in service. For such an upper class restaurant in the Disneyland area, they are just decent.  SERVICE: Everytime I've been here the hostesses always seem to be very annoyed and distant when guest come up. I understand that huge crowds swarm in sometimes but the various of times that I've visited this location, they still seem to be the exact same. The waiters are a step up thankfully. I appriciate that they are usually friendly and helpful when under the pressure of so many tables to balance. FOOD:  I love that while browsing through the menu, fresh bread is served to seated guest! -Shrimp Pasta: Obviously different pasta plates use different noodles, but the spaghetti type noodles they use for this dish is a little hard. Luckily the more chewy, easy to bite toppings such as the shrimp and fried fish pieces balance out the texture making it a decent choice.  -Fettuccine Alfredo: is quite a deliciously filling dish! The noodles are cooked to perfection and the Alfredo sauce was pleasing! I highly recommend this choice! -Burgers: are huge and the meat is tender! A little over priced but satisfying and big enough to be worth it! RECOMMENDED Cakes/Cheesecakes: -Triple Chocolate Cake   -Banana Cream Pie Cheesecake -Snickers Cheesecake  -Original Cheesecake If you're wanting a better experience and to get dinner, then I recommend the Cheesecake Factory in Brea, Westminster, and Irvine!

Beyond cheesecake, I've never had a meal here that lived up to the price or the basic level of experience they guarantee.  In an effort to kill time and simultaneously fill my grumbling belly, I ate lunch here while staying at a nearby hotel. It was a slow Tuesday and one of the rare times I've been here where there wasn't a huge crowd. I sat at the bar. The bartender was a nice guy, chatting me up about my travels and making his personal recommendations. The unfortunate part was the meal itself. I ordered the ""spicy"" crispy chicken sandwich which comes with either a chipotle sauce or a buffalo sauce. I ordered the buffalo sauce. After an unusually long wait for the sandwich considering I was one of the few people there, it came out with the chipotle sauce on the side and no buffalo sauce on the chicken, as I was told there was. I asked for a side of buffalo sauce and was told the manager would bring it out. He did without a word. It would have been courteous to get an apology at the least for the mixup, but at that point satisfying my hunger was the top priority. The chicken and salad were pretty tasty, despite the lack of sauce.  The Cheesecake Factory is great for their namesake or a couple drinks at the bar.

Service from our wait staff was just ok and a little condescending. After having ordered, it took a very long time to get our drinks. Food took a while to arrive as well, and entrees were served staggered, so that a few got their food well before others. Although food portions were large, the quality and taste were just mediocre . This had been my experience from years past and, sadly, the same holds true today. The gigantic menu (nearly 20 pages) and overwhelming choices probably hinder a job well done. As well, prices are a bit high (although it might be, in part, due to close proximity to Disneyland).  I like a variety of food joints, from inexpensive, hole-in-the-wall type places to fine dining restaurants. Even cheap places can produce great tasting food. I think this chain can and should do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=260

Kev O.,"Irvine, CA",32,389,860,4.0,10/19/2014,"My brother and friends were visiting Disneyland and invited me to drive up to join them for lunch at this Cheesecake Factory. A little concerned about parking availability, I did just a bit of research and discovered there's a huge parking garage just a few doors down right next to Bubba Gumps, so I was relieved. I arrived at the garage at 12 noon and there was plenty of parking. First 60 minutes are free, then it's about $6 for the hour after, etc. However, if you validate at one of the restaurants here, I believe you get an additional 3 free hours .....or something like that....yay! Just a short walk from the garage we arrive at the front door of the Cheesecake Factory. Pretty much the same setup as all the other Cheesecake Factories I'd been to in the US. The nice and friendly hostess at the podium greeted us as we entered....and immediately sat us as the place wasn't crowded at all.....and no line waiting for a table....all the other CFs I'd been too were packed with at least a 10-20 minute wait. I'm actually pretty surprised, but I guess everybody was busy at the park. What can I say that hasn't already been said about the food here. Pretty much the same as any other CF.....very extensive and one can easily be overwhelmed with all the yummy choices! SO it's good if you're a regular and know pretty much what there is and what you're going to order.  The server (Alana) I think was so totally friendly, helpful, and attentive throughout. Always checking on us to make sure we were happy and whether we needed anything. In fact, one of our friends had some ankle problem and made a request for a bag of ice to ice it down.....and Alana was more than happy to do this for him! Knowing how huge the portions of the Entrees are here, we knew we could never finish. So, we went ahead and did a shared style lunch where we'd order an appetizer (Chicken Samosas) to start off, and then each of us would order a ""small plate"" dish...........Avacado Eggrolls, Factory Chopped Salad, and the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas......the Grilled Corn Cakes that came with the tortillas were really delicious! But pretty much everything was good as expected. At the end of it all, Alana asked if we would like any dessert? Eeeer, no....we were stuffed and all that sugar at lunch really can't be good for you :S In fact, Alana told us that although a few people actually ordered cheesecakes to eat as their dessert, most people would order the huge slices to go. By 1pm this place was pretty full, but not packed, and I still didn't see any lines out the door....which was quite a surprise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=260

Charlton C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",1001,318,330,3.0,4/9/2015,"I haven't been to a cheesecake factory and years and coming here reminds me why.  I came here with my date after watching Furious 7, since it was 10pm on Easter Sunday, many places were already closed. Thankfully there were a few restaurants that were still open so I opted to select Cheesecake factory.  There was little to no wait thankfully because I was starving. As we got seated, I noticed that the booth was dirty; there were still leftover food on the seat that I had to brush off, also the menus were sticky and the silverware was dirty, definitely not off to a good start. Our server came along and she was very pleasant and friendly. Certainly ended up saving the review to be doomed 2 star to 3 so kudos to our waitress.  Since it's been so long since I've eaten here, I hardly remembered the menu and oh boy what a vast menu that they have! Somewhere around 20 pages there is a little bit of everything here which I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. Want tacos? They have it. Want Chinese food? Sure. In the mood for some pasta? It's here. You get my point, it's kinda of insane. To be honest, I was a bit overwhelmed at the choices that finally after looking through the menu a good 2-3 times I finally just opted to get a breakfast omelet with sweet potato fries since breakfast items are my go to choice for when I can't decide on what to get.  When the food arrived, the portions were larger than expected which was a surprise. The omelet was at least the size of two and the sweet potato fries came in a huge bucket. My date couldn't decide either so she ordered the breakfast sandwich which was also huge. The food tasted as it should so no complaints on that end. The only gripe that I had was that the omelet was filled with potatoes and not so much on the meat side.  I only ate about 1/3 of the omelet because I wanted to save room for the cheesecake. We decided to get the key lime cheesecake which was very sour and tarty just the way I liked it.  **Special shout out to our waitress again, she was on point with everything and made the entire experience enjoyable and I wish there were more like her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=220
Deborah G.,"Oxnard, CA",1,27,1,2.0,4/25/2016,"I am normally a fan of the Cheesecake Factory --having eaten at four or five different establishments more than a dozen times over the years.  This was my only bad experience -- but bad enough to warrant a ""heads up"" to others.   Four of us dined last Friday.  One asked for an omelette dish that included peppers and chorizo.   She asked to have peppers on the side, but it arrived with peppers mixed in.  We mentioned it to our waiter who hesitated.  We didn't want to make a big deal, so we instead asked for a small plate to put the peppers.  It never came.  What's worse, her dinner did NOT have any chorizo.  She was our guest, and she didn't want to complain.  If my husband hadn't noticed her lack of meat at the end of the meal, I wouldn't have realized she basically had eggs for dinner.   My favorite dish is Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, so I ordered it. When it arrived, the coconut and rice were dry, almost stale.  The chicken pieces were larger than usual, and a bit rubbery.  There were fewer shrimp than in other places, and the dish could have used two more tablespoons of sauce.  But the creepy part is that there were two rigatoni within.  I couldn't help but wonder how something so foreign got into my food.  Then it hit me that the chicken was not at all like how it usually is in this dish.  Did someone else's leftovers get in my food?   I just stopped eating, but because our table was basically having a reunion, I did not want the unpleasantness of speaking to the manager.  It was not a night for drama.   There are several quality restaurants in the same complex.  We don't live near Anaheim, but for those who do -- you will want to choose one of the other places.   This is not a place I would want to revisit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=220

This Anaheim location is very nice.  Smaller than some I've been to, it has high ceilings and the typical decor.  The indoor seating is very busy and close together, but the high backed booths make the dining experience feel intimate.  Our waitress was wonderful- friendly and very fast despite being busy.  We were seated near the windows and had a nice view of Katella Ave. with it's tall palm trees.  The food was excellent quality, done very well.  It was a great place to have a fun meal talking with the best friends.  Excellent place for tourists to relax and unwind after a long day in Anaheim.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=220

He also left all of the dirty plates and uneaten bread on the table the entire night. There was no room to place a cup but he would try to slide it onto the table, without asking if we wanted anything removed. It was a very crowded, filthy table.

We were delighted to get to enjoy dinner on a weeknight. We chose a chain restaurant due to convenience for the kids (kids menu, nice bathrooms). My husband had the pasta, I had shrimp scampi & steak, and the kids had corn dogs and chicken tenders. We felt the food and service was good.  That is...UNTIL the next day! My 1 year old threw up the next morning and was on a diet of Pedialyte and bread. We were thinking it was the pasta he shared with his dad or the milk he drank at the restaurant. After my 1 year old felt better, my husband complained of a stomach bug, and he also threw up several times. At this point I'm very sure it was the pasta they ate as it was the only thing different within the last 48 hours that my husband and son consumed. It doesn't end there, my 5 year old complained about being sick a few hours after my husband and on cue vomits everywhere. So 3/4 of us fell violently ill. What a coincidence...

With the two so close together, we are one happy family! It's become our tradition to visit The Cheesecake Factory on Katella at least once during our trips to Disneyland. It's a great start to our vacation, as we anticipate spending the next day at the parks. On a recent trip, we left Disneyland midday and walked over for lunch. Although the restaurant was busy, it was a nice break from the frantic atmosphere of the parks. The food was as good as ever. My son loves the wheat bread in the bread basket and would make a meal of it if he could. My favorite meal is the  avocado egg rolls . On this visit for lunch, I had the BBQ Chicken Salad, which I also love. We like the variety offered on the menu and everyone always finds something amazing to eat. The service was good, as usual.  We have also found that this is a good location for meeting friends who live in the So. Cal. area. We can walk from Disneyland-area, and our friends can get there easily and use the parking garage. We say, ""Meet us at The Cheesecake Factory"" and everyone is game! The last time we came here, we randomly chose to visit this restaurant about 6 pm one night. We walked in and we're given a table immediately on the patio. The menu was huge, refillable soda drinks extremely good value. The orange chicken was delightful and all other items were enjoyed by family. The complimentary bread was very tasty. Miso salmon is always a fabulous dish here.

According to him he's had better at whole in the wall joints.  The waitress Britney was super nice though, so some kudos to her :) Ordered a Banana cheesecake at the end which was delicious! I will only come here for dessert and that's about it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=280

Bota A.,"Irvine, CA",32,57,90,5.0,7/11/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory by far has the best service compared to the ones in spectrum Irvine and the Huntigton Beach.  The server explained all the special of the day in-depth and was really nice. She checked our tables several times to see if we needed anything. (In irvine- server takes order, brings the drinks, other servers bring out the food, we finish eating, no sign of our server, after 10 mins waiting she comes and hands our check-literally that's all she did- the last 3 times).  I always order exact same things: -Blueberry Mojito - so refreshing and you don't taste much of a strong bacardi, the combination is just perfect. - Luau salad - it's filled with greens, chicken, nut, and crispy large tortilla like thing- so yummy, 1 order will feed 4 people, trust me!  - Combo-: chicken madeira and steak diane (well done) comes with mushroom madeira sauce, mashed potato and asparagus (it's on page 14!!!) -i just can't enough of these, really good stuff.

Lisa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",379,58,92,3.0,8/22/2015,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory, 3 times this week, and sadly each time I came they did nothing spectacular for me to give them anything more than 3 stars... and I even think 3 stars is me being nice but the second time I came here this week, they gave me great service. The first day I went here, I came at night with a large party celebrating a birthday. I have never been to this Cheesecake Factory because my go-to one is the Brea one. However, when I came with this party we were seated outside and the waitress, Melissa S, was very accommodating to our growing party. Melissa, was a good server. She was able to split all of our checks (12) easily without a hitch. She took our orders in a quick and friendly manner and she was even very keen on offering us a dessert to eat after she came out to surprise our two birthday girls.  The only downside I must say I had with Melissa was the attitude she kind of gave me at the end of the night, when it came to me asking for my Cheesecake to-go. I had ordered a Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake with the strawberries on the side, however, when I got my cheesecake, the strawberries were clearly on it, and syrup as well. I ended up telling Melissa that I had wanted the strawberries completely separate from the cheesecake because the person I was getting it for wasn't going to eat the cheesecake that night and didn't want the cheesecake to be saturated with the syrup and get soggy. She ended up showing her annoyance by giving me a long stare, then a little sigh as she said she'd fix it for me. When she came back with my ""newly fixed cheesecake"" all she simply did was remove the three strawberries and place it in a separate large container and give me back the already saturated in strawberry syrup cheesecake I clearly said I didn't want. Her attitude she gave me at the end was clearly seen by those sitting around me and they even mentioned her hostility to me. Aside from Melissa's downfall in service, the food here did not taste as great as other Cheesecake Factory's I've been to. The Angel Hair Pasta w/ Shrimp was extremely salty. I drank a good amount of water after each bite because of how much salt they used in the pasta. It was like the entire ocean's salt was in this dish. Others around me ordered pasta as well and had mentioned that their dishes were really salty so we concluded that it must have been the pasta water that was too salty.  When it came down to the pasta sauce, this one seemed like it was missing flavor because I felt like all I was tasting were tomatoes and nothing else. The portions however were out of this world large. I barely scratched the mountain of pasta I got. I don't think I would order this dish again at this restaurant due to how salty the dish was overall. When I came back here the next night, I came simply just to get a order of cheesecake to-go and the person who had helped me and my date out, was so kind. I definitely recommend getting it to-go because as busy as it was at night when we had ordered our cheesecakes, we got it in less than 5 minutes. Amazing.  Yesterday, was the third day I came and I simply came to get cheesecake but instead of to-go, my friend and I decided to dine in. The wait to get a table was very quick. However our server, Carnell M, took a very long time to attend to us. We waited what seemed like 20 minutes before he took our order. It was a simple order no doubt but it is a bit ridiculous to wait that long. Our stuff came out in about 15-20 minutes. He came to check up on us once, and that was about it. His personality was an A+. He was funny, easy going, laughing, smiling and just all around had a great and friendly personality.  The only thing that irritates me the most is when a server hoovers over me when I am still looking at the receipt because they are so eager to get their money. And this is what he was doing to me. Carnell was pretty much was so keen on getting our check and pretty much would come back to grab that black book, even when I was clearly still reading the receipt. Once we were done paying and we stood up to leave, he came so quick to get the book. No thank you, no have a nice night, nothing. Just grabbed our money and left.  For the most part, this Cheesecake Factory has it's ups and it's downs but I want to say it has more downs than ups. All I know is that I think I will only order cheesecake to go at this one or just go to my usual Cheesecake Factory in Brea or the one at the Grove in LA, they obviously know how to be a bit more hospitable than this one does.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=280

We got there around 8pm so I wasn't surprised to see a big crowd of people. The wait for 4 people was only 20 minutes so we decided to wait, and sure enough we only waited a small amount of time.  Right when we were seated our drink orders were taken, which was really good. After that we were served the usual bread and butter. Those seemed to be the highlights of this dining experience. We were ready to order but no one would even come to our table, but instead stopped at the ones around us. When we finally ordered, the wait took SO long. All we ate was bread, bread, butter, and more bread.  I had the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which were good, but had a kind of sweet flavor. I'm not quiet sure what it was but I dont think I'll be ordering it again. I found my self finishing the bread and asking for various to go boxes since it was late by the time we got our food. When we asked for the boxes, the waiter took or plates to I guess put it in the boxes. We told him we only wanted the Kids Mac and Cheese wrapped up, and were confused when he brought is three boxes. We checked to see what was inside the two boxes, in one was one small lettuce taco that my friend had left and the other had only the contents of what had fallen on to my plate from my taco, no actual taco.

Catherine B.,"San Diego, CA",128,66,667,3.0,9/24/2014,"I don't go to Cheesecake Factory locations very often, as I usually view them as somewhat overpriced for mediocre food. I feel like you're paying a bit more for the ""trendy ambiance"" rather than for quality, spectacular food. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a very difficult person to please - especially when it comes to food. I just feel that The Cheesecake Factory can be a bit overrated - it seems more of a novelty than anything. I've been to this location a few times and have received great service. Any inconveniences that myself or anyone else dining with me may have encountered during our visits were promptly and justly addressed - such as apologizing for an error in the kitchen which would cause a delay in receiving a food order and offering an appetizer or other item free of charge. Since this is just a few skips away from Disneyland, beware that it is in the middle of a tourist stomping ground, and you may have to wait a bit longer for a table depending on the time of the day you decide to attend. One of the upsides is that they do offer take-out, so if you are staying at a nearby hotel, you may order ahead of time and just take your food back to your room. Something I do particularly love about any & all Cheesecake Factory locations is their exceptional variety of desserts! I'm definitely a sucker for anything that appeases my sweet tooth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=300
Kelsey C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,3,1.0,8/12/2016,"Seriously had an awful experience here yesterday. Before I write this just know that my boyfriend and I both work in the restaurant industry so we can tell if a server is actually busy or just being lazy. This was plain laziness.  We were promptly seated and our waiter took about ten minutes to get over to our table. We ordered alcoholic drinks. We were brought water without asking for it (which was really nice to be honest)! He dropped them off and went over to his other tables (he was being very friendly and attentive to them but for some reason not to us) and finally came over to take our order only to realize we STILL didn't have our alcoholic beverages. Went to get them and then took our order. And that was basically the last we saw of him. Manager brought our appetizers and noticed our drinks were empty and asked if we wanted a refill. The refills were then dropped off and we received our food. When we were done eating our server asked if we needed anything else and we said boxes and check. Takes him another 10 minutes to grab our plates to box them up and drop off the check.  Then we asked for our $95 check to be split down the middle. Takes him another 10 minutes to bring back the split check of $45 and some change each.  BUT, to my surprise today I notice that on my credit card i have been charged THREE times for this. $95 once ( I am guessing he charged my card in full accidentally and then had it pulled back without informing me.) Charged another $95, followed by the $45.  This is honestly ridiculous. It honestly felt like he saw two twenty somethings sit down who weren't all dressed up and thought, 'eh I'm not going to get a tip out of them so why bother.' He was so attentive to his other tables and not to us. I will not be returning to this location just based off this experience alone.

It has a tiny bit of spice which I didn't mind and it was packed the flavor. There is an option where you can choose either white or brown rice that comes with the plate as well. Personally, I went for the white and it was a great compliment to the meal as a whole.  The drinks we ordered were also great. I ordered a piña colada and my girlfriend a mango margarita.

Ranj P.,"Orange County, CA",142,172,26,1.0,5/18/2016,"I love the cheesecake factory so the two star rating is only for this specific location. It was my mother and father-in-law's anniversary about one month ago and they wanted to go somewhere different. I suggested we go to the Cheesecake Factory because it's somewhere we've never eaten together as a family. After waiting 45 minutes to be seated we had to wait an additional 15 minutes for our waitress to take our drink and appetizer orders. After our appetizer orders went in our waitress came back and asked us if we wanted to put in our dinner order. We told her we would like to wait for appetizers to get here and to start eating before we place our dinner orders however, she insisted that we give her our orders at the present time and she would ensure that our meals would not come out until our appetizers were finished. Unfortunately, it did not happen that way. Our meals and appetizers both came out at the same time which really upset my father-in-law. We asked our waitress if she could take our meals back and if she could bring them back when we were done with our appetizers. She told us that wouldn't be a problem however the meal my brother-in-law ordered was a steak medium done and she told us the steak would continue cooking if he didn't eat it right away.  I personally think this was wrong and rude of our waitress. It was clearly her mistake to bring out both our meals and appetizers at the same time when we clearly told her we wanted them separately and now she's telling us one of our meals will be overcooked if we don't consume it right away. This kind of service is absolutely ridiculous. I've been to many other cheesecake factories in my life and I'm never had service this bad before ever. I'm definitely going to think twice before I come back to this location.  I definitely suggest that the restaurant manager have a long talk with the staff to ensure that they follow through with what they promised their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=300

Gaby A.,"Fullerton, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2017,"How does a restaurant not accommodate food for a type 1 diabetic? Let me just start off by saying I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. This specific location is the one my family and I always celebrate birthdays, graduations, and bring out of town family to. We've always been treated with the best customer service, which is why we always choose this location even though the parking is a bit of a hassle. So then why the 1 star rating you might ask? Well, my family and I came here right after my pinning ceremony to celebrate me graduating from nursing school. So this dinner was kind of a big deal. There was about 11 of my family members there, one of them being my fairly new diagnosed Type 1 diabetic 18 year old niece. We always ask for a nutritional menu for her so she can make her choices based on the amount of carbs she's supposed to have per meal. If anyone knows anything about diabetes and carb counting then you know how important it is to know how many carbs are in a meal so that the proper units of insulin are given. The item on the menu that fit her carb load for dinner was the lunch portion of chicken alfredo, the dinner portion far exceeded the amount of carbs she could have for a meal. When we asked the waiter if we could still have the lunch portion for her and explained why, we were told they couldn't do that because lunch was over.  As I said before we come to this specific location all the time, and they've done this for us before multiple times even if lunch hour is over. Why this night was different I'm not entirely sure. We asked to speak to the manager who also denied our request after thoroughly explaining our situation. I was entirely floored and to be frank disgusted at how the situation was handled. We weren't asking for the food to be made differently, we just asked for a smaller portion for ONE person in our party for a medical reason.  The worst part about this entire situation was the way they made my 18 yr old niece feel about her illness. Being newly diagnosed with a lifelong disease that takes major life style changes is hard enough for anyone but for someone so young it's harder to adjust. She had finally started feeling less ashamed about her diabetes and this was a complete slap in the face for her. She sat in her seat and silently cried while all this was happening, completely embarrassed for even asking. My entire dinner and truthfully day was ruined. This was supposed to be a celebratory dinner & an end to a good day. At the end of it they tried to rectify the situation by offering to comp us a slice of cheesecake. Really? I mean I understand their gesture but to try and give us a slice of cheesecake when the whole reason there was even an issue was because of someone who has diabetes is just so backwards. My family and I left this place so disappointed, we hardly touched our food.  I would think that for as big of a restaurant that Cheesecake Factory is, they would be more sensitive about guests who require adjustments due to medical reasons but I guess not, I would suggest avoiding this place if you or a family member or friend might require an adjustment as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=300
Diana T.,"Anaheim, CA",920,630,1456,3.0,9/17/2012,"There is a parking structure where you can park but on Sundays = no tickets = no validation = free parking and valet!  Got here around 6pm and got seated right away! (3 people).  There menu is very extensive and is filled with so many things that I was overwhelmed by just flipping through the menu.  They offer a variety of foods from mexican, asian, american, and so forth.  To make decisions a little easier and healthier, I browsed the ""SKINNYLICIOUS"" menu.  They have a variety of choices under 490 calories so I chose 2 things from there since they are pretty small.  Before ordering, they give you bread which was delicious!!  Onto the food Ahi Tartare ($7.00)- So light and refreshing!  If you like sushi, this is definitely a must.  The soy sauce, avocado and fish had such  great combination and it tasted really amazing Flatbread: WILD MUSHROOM,Garlic, Shallots and Fresh Herbs ($6.00)- This was just okay.  The mushroom tasted a little burnt and there was not much flavor to it.  I was expecting lots of herbs but it was very bland Salisbury steak: this came with some mashed potatoes and some sautéed string beans.  The steak was very moist and tender.  You don't even need a knife to cut through it.  The steak was missing something.  Can't really put my finger on it but I thought this dish was okay.  The mashed potatoes was also kind of bland. Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic ($17.00)- Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce.  The sauce makes this dish a winner!  This delicious plate was amazingly creamy, tasty, and full of flavors.  I wish I would've gotten this!!  I tasted some of it from my friend and I wanted more!!  But I opted for being more healthy. Overall, the service was okay.  They made a mistake on my order and brought out crab cakes which I did not order so I had to wait longer for my ahi tartare!  Other than that, they were quick about it.  I probably would  not come back here for awhile.   A bit pricey which I feel that I can find this type of food elsewhere for a cheaper price NOTE: -Birthday = free scoop of ice cream with a candle",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=300

My dad, who also ordered the scampi but got it with pasta, was eyeing my plate wishing he had customized his order too.  Dessert was the key lime cheesecake.  Yum.

Jonathan G.,"Irving, TX",0,5,,5.0,7/18/2016,"I work in fine dining and my family goes to disney land almost every year . I walked into this restuarant and experienced horrible customer service from the host and what seems like the host manager. I have specifically asked for a veteran server who not only knows a significicant amount of menu knowledge But someone who can go above and beyond with ""wow"" service. So this is what i got. My server was named Liz.   She properly introuduced herself and spent an appropriate amount time to accommodate us as far as wine and entrees.  When receiving my wine it was the wrong wine, ( That tells me staff doesn't communicate or aren't trained properly ). It wasnt liz who served me the wrong wine. It was another server. However, Liz expressed her most sincerest apologies and have paid more attention to my table than the managment team.  She stepped up her game and not only gave me exceptional customer service but i also noticed she stepped up where service was compromised during my visit to this estblishment.  I have visit multiple locations throughout the US, (Dallas TX, Phx AZ, etc.) and noticed that liz stood out than most servers i have experienced. So i hope she gets recognized for this. I understand the service industry. But when it comes to the facility having a good name and reputable status. I recommend liz for this quality of service. You will not be disappointed. I have expressed to manager "" Mario "" that i did not have a good time. He showed little to no emotion to remedy the situation.

SERVICE: She was nice. Prompt with drinks so no criticism there, but I was appalled when I arrived to my car and notice that she could have offered validation for parking.  Why didnt she offer this to me?

He said the mac and cheese burger was good so I went with that and he ordered the mahi mahi. Both dishes were good. The burger had a deep fried mac and cheese ball on top of the patty that was again topped with more cheese (melted cheesey goodness). Their fries were so-so, just didn't like that they were cut so small, made them hard to dip without getting my fingers in the ketchup. The mahi mahi is on their skinnylicious menu and for it being a little under 600, it is quite flavorful. If and when I order a cheesecake here, I always get the classic cheesecake with fresh strawberries. Because he is in love with the godiva chocolate cheesecake, we went with that. I must admit, this cheesecake is addicting. It has layers of FLOURLESS godiva chocolate cake, godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse. Each bite was luscious, rich, decadent, smooth and tantalized every taste bud on my tongue that left me wanting more (major foodgasm!!!).

I ordered a Grey Goose martini, hubby had a Macallan 12 on rocks, turned out my Grey Goose was more expensive than Macallan?! We were surprised, hubby says "" babe you are expensive!"" Those drinks were strong and tasty, our favorites. Had edamame from the Skinnylicious menu to snack on, it was so delicious, lightly salted, great to go with my martini. It was really nice and relaxing to sip on drinks and snack on edamame, I had another Grey Goose Bloody Mary, it was a big salty and spicy pour, loved it!  Our bartender was very friendly and polite, did a little chat with us, it was fun. I have to come back here sometime soon, their new Skinnylicious, small plates & snacks menus are perfect for late night lounging.

The Cheesecake Factory is the 'it' restaurant for little teens to impress their first dates. I'm not ashamed to say The Cheesecake Factory is one of my all time favourite restaurants and I think it will remain that way. I am reviewing this location because I've been to this one several times when I was working at the Wells Fargo building a few years back. I've been here twice this year - once with my Italian visiting friend and a more recent time with my friends. You could never really go wrong here with their extensive and very easy menu. The Chicken Madeira, Spicy Cashew Chicken, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and the Ahi Tuna Salad are the items I would usually get - yes, this is the only time where I go 'big' I suppose. Yet the last two times I was here I asked for the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken, an item I always overlooked. The Lemon Roasted Chicken is a half chicken that is already quartered for you. it comes with soft carrots and a very flavourful bunch of watercress paired with their usual mashers. The chicken was SO tender and flavourful - even both my guests agreed when they tried it! How could I have missed this the numerous times I've been here? It is clearly my new favourite! Yes, The Cheesecake Factory may not always be the healthiest, but the food never really goes wrong here.

The crust was nice and crispy with the right amount of cheese. We hate it when pizza is over loaded with cheese which happens often. We ordered their chicken soft tacos off their ""skinnylicious"" menu and they were extremely bland. I've gotten food off "" skinny"" menus before and they do have flavor in them.

Service was reasonable. My drink was refilled promptly after being empty. The cherry cheesecake we had was pretty good too. It wasn't super dense like some cheesecakes so I liked that. 2 complaints about it... not enough cherries and what exactly is the point of a graham cracker crust if it's soggy?

Food: the kitchen does a good job on the food, for the most part.  Entree salads are quite large.  Appetizers are tasty.  My only real gripe is the vietnamese spring roll.  I understand the taste is not going to be authentic, but the wrap was slightly brittle.  This is caused by prepping the roll and leaving it in the fridge for way too long before serving.  It needs to be removed from the menu, or prepped before service.  Even a day is way too long for the rice wrap.   Cheesecakes are of course, phenomenal.  The red velvet is to die for... almost literally (see the calories). I believe one is equal to over half your daily caloric intake.   The menu is quite extensive, but I guess that's a good thing for a family w/ different desires.   Drinks are standard, w/ a decent selection of beers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=380

Mariko C.,"San Diego, CA",1,67,77,1.0,8/26/2014,"Why bother writing about an establishment that already has nearly 500 reviews? The most UNPROFESSIONAL customer service I have ever received anywhere, and it actually makes for a pretty good story. Came here at 2:00 pm for an afternoon lunch break from Disneyland. It was not crowded at all, and my boyfriend and I were seated right away. And that's when things turned sour. Just as we were about to place our order, a MASSIVE black beetle the size of a half dollar crawled out of the cushion of our booth, right next to my boyfriend. We were very alarmed and immediately moved away to avoid it. And that's not even the worst of it... Because hey, it's summer, and unfortunately, bugs happen. So here's the horrible part: Our waitress looks at the beetle and says, ""Ewww that's soooo gross!"" She then hands my boyfriend a PAPER NAPKIN and asks him to KILL IT! He was so shocked he didn't know what to do, so I jumped in and said ""Are you kidding me? NO, he is absolutely NOT going to kill that thing!"" (as it's still creepily crawling towards us). So the waitress proceeds to ask us to place our order and we sat there dumbfounded that she wouldn't even consider accommodating us. We, THE CUSTOMERS, had to request to be moved to a different table because of the beetle situation! She tells us to just scoot down to the other end of the booth.  At that point, I don't even know why we stayed at the restaurant, but we were really hungry, so perhaps our judgement was impaired. But little did we know, we were in for even more disappointment. Omelette was under-cooked, toast was burned black, food was generally very greasy. But it took so long for the food to come out that we didn't want to bother requesting anything different and having even more delays. Who do they have working here on Saturday afternoons, anyway?? In our experience, this place is way overpriced with extremely sub-par service. If you're already in the area, might as well spend your money on overpriced food at the theme parks or Downtown Disney which you'll actually enjoy. We thoroughly regretted coming here, and we will never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=380

Next, my friend's heaping salad, a bowl of soup, a pizza, and my salad and white bean hummus dip with pita arrived.  The hummus was creamy smooth and redolent with garlic while the pita was toasty warm. Delish. The last person to receive his order was my friend's husband -- his pasta order was botched ... twice!  The restaurant kindly made up for it, but the mixup made the late night even later.   After all that, we were way too tired and grumpy to enjoy any of the restaurant's celebrated cheesecakes.  Sigh.  Thankfully I can go to the restaurant in Waikiki, though I just heard they had a fire there this morning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=380

Lighting was pretty dark though, needs just a little brighter light. Servers are friendly, knows the menu and fast. Bread was warm and good. Love the brown bread. Their pastas never disappoint. Huge portions, flavors are on point, and they don't skimp on the chicken pieces which are big. Food is perfectly priced for the amount they give you; serves two people for each plate.

Negative:  took a long time to take our order,   When it was taken, it took 50 mins for us to get our food. :( The service was horrid!  I asked the server about 5 times for a glass of water, table bread and that took a while.  There was a couple who was seated about 15 minutes after we were and they ordered and received their food about 15 mins later, before we did The server, came by after I asked the 3rd time about our food and he said he would check.  Guess what, he never came back until our food was delivered.   At about the 45 minute mark, 2 of our 3 dishes came out.  The last one to come out was the Hamburger.  I tell you, 2 small pasta dishes and a regular hamburger with fries, took 50 minutes.  This by far is the worse experience I have ever had a major restaurant chain.  I/we were so tempted to get up and leave but then I would not have any food.   I did ask for the manager, gave him my mind and ask him what the heck was going on?  Outside of trying to sell me on when the server took our order (which also took a long time), I also brought up about the other group across the way sat down a long time after we did and they got their food first.  He did comp us for the burger in the end but the waste of time was just unpleasant.  :( Cheescake factory Anaheim, Ca get your house in order!  I should have read the reviews first!

Robin N.,"Santa Maria, CA",20,23,,1.0,10/14/2015,"I hate to leave a negative review but this time it is a must.  There is a QUEEN of the bullies working at the Cheesecake Factory in Anaheim.   On October 12th at about 4:40 pm, I approached a woman at the Cheesecake To Go counter to pick up my order.  She was clearly a manager due to her manner of dress.  Apparently I interrupted something VERY important because the look she gave me would have melted glass!  She then sat tossed my order on the counter and ran my card.  However it was clear to me that the order was incorrect.  I stated this fact to her in a polite manner.  Oh Brother!  That did not go over well at all.  A look of fear crossed the faces of the workers behind her.  She shoved my order ticket in the hand of a woman who was literately trembling with fear.  Then the ""manager"" stormed off to the kitchen area. The very frightened workers proceeded to help me with my order in a very polite and efficient manner.  The ""monster"" returned just prior to my leaving to help a new customer picking up a To Go order.  She was equally rude to this poor lady as well. I wish I knew this horrible lady's name but she had no name tag.  I would love to report her to upper management. Cheesecake Factory, is this the best you can find???  So many fine people who need jobs.  I am a teacher,  I know a bully when I see one.  Your restaurant is better than this representative.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=360

The host and the girl who seated us were lovely, they must get so over the Disney crowds (we saw mega groups trying to get tables and getting huffy when they couldn't be seated straight away) but they never let it show. But our server, Cam, was the star of the show. Friendly, funny and extremely personable. There were 3 of us and he sat down beside me to help us order like an old friend! Just one of those people who has natural charisma. He almost correctly guessed we were from New Zealand, Australia is the next closest guess haha. When he saw my face at the size of my burrito (which was insanely huge) he cracked into this grin and made a joke about weight...lol I won't repeat it but we all cracked up. And the burrito was fricken delicious, apparently I made a good attempt on it. They don't call it a grande burrito for nothing!  We walked away full, with yummy cheesecake for later and huge appreciation for Cam's attentive and friendly service.

Fashion Valley here in San Diego where the food is excellent with good service. We thought we would enjoy the same service at this Anaheim location.  Well we were disappointed. Even though our waitress was polite and efficient, the food server was rude and condescending. When she served us a bowl of soup she slid it across the table like she was a cook in the Navy chow hall. She was in such a hurry she couldn't slow down enough to properly serve the food (which appeared to be her only job by the way).  We were a little taken aback by her abrupt manner but we let it slide.  However later I mistook her for our waitress and I asked her for another glass of wine. She did not even respond to my request but instead gave me a look that showed me and my family that she didn't  want to either take the time nor be bother with such a request as a customer asking for something. Everyone at my table was appalled by her look of disdain. What made matters worse is that we were there to celebrate my step-daughter's birthday.  I requested to speak to the manager because of this woman's attitude and requested that she and her negative energy stay away from our table. The manager was cool-he apologized and listened to my complaint about this young lady and comped us a free glass of wine and dessert. But our bill was expensive and we certainly did not need any attitude from the staff.  I personally feel these restaurants in Anaheim get tired of dealing with the Disneyland crowd.

I cant remember which one but he ate it all.  One friend had the pecan crusted salmon - she loved it.  I cant remember what our other friend had, it was something he always gets because he knew right away what he was ordering.   This restaurant is located in The Garden Walk shopping/dining area that is really close to the Disney parks.  We walked here so I am not sure where or how parking is here.

I have, also, dined at this location a few times, and I don't have any complaints - the service has always been friendly, and the food has always been good.

We were told that they wouldn't seat us unless the 80% of our friends arrived, which is pretty understandable. Well, everybody showed up around 8 and we still had to wait another 1 1/2 hr to be seated and eat. Totally ridiculous, considering that they refused to group together 3 tables and have us seated there. On top of that, one of the waitress made a mistake with the orders so one of my friends had to wait 30 minutes for his plate and......it was wrong too!! Very unpleasant experience.

If you aren't sure what to get, try the Shepard's Pie or, if you like spicy food, the Jambalaya Pasta, can't go wrong with those.  What really bugged me about the server is that she got really rude towards the end. We asked for a split bill, and she let out the biggest and rudest sigh I've ever heard and said ""it's gonna take a while."" I just wanted to be like, ""it's okay, we got all night."" She brought our bill out like 3 minutes later so I don't know what she was complaining about.  In the end I won't be back, you got to pay for parking in a structure and our server was rude.

However service was really slow. And when we did get service, our waiter wasn't even paying attention. We asked for all brown bread, he gave us the regular mix (with sourdough). My friend asked for the factory salad with no bleu cheese and she got a salad with bleu cheese. My water cup still had food pieces left on it.. pretty disgusting. Our waiter was there, he asked if everything was alright, etc but I kept thinking he knows how to ask the right questions but I don't think he listens hahah. It was a pretty hectic day. There's a cheerleading competition going on, lots of teeny boopers roaming the Disneyland streets. I got the Luau Salad. It is pretty big and it was delicious!

I decided to share the Chicken Potstickers and the Spaghetti and Meatballs with a friend. The portion sizes were good enough to feed us both, since we also planned to order a Strawberry Cheesecake to share. The Potstickers were fine - the skin was very soggy due to the excess sauce, but I didn't expect much from an American restaurant doing something Chinese. The Spaghetti and Meatballs were fine. They were edible but not super delicious. Since we ordered our Cheesecake at the beginning of our meal, we were hoping the waiter would remember and we could ask for the bill so that we could return to the hotel, as it was late at night.

Steve L.,"San Mateo, CA",833,684,1066,4.0,5/14/2011,"It's the Friday before my daughters' cheerleading national competition that weekend. Many of her team mates and their families chose use this day to wind down after spending the previous days at Disneyland, or they were just arriving from the Bay Area.  Usually, the coaches call a practice in the late afternoon, and would run for a few hours. Knowing this, we planned on having a late lunch to carry everyone over through dinner. The girls wanted to go to Cheesecake Factory, and we originally planned on 10 of us.  Later that morning, many of their team mates just arrived into the area, and we invited them and their families to join us. Soon that number increased to 25.  Cheesecake Factory was still on the top of the girls' list, so I called up this location to see if they can accommodate us at 2PM, knowing that they usually don't take any reservations. The manager said that she couldn't guarantee anything, but will do their best to set aside a group of tables for us.  We arrived 1:40PM to let the hostess know that our party was here. They did block out an area for us, and there was just one party that was just finishing. Right at 2PM, the tables were cleared, the settings were placed, and we were seated (girls on section, parents on the other)!  Even with so many us, the server was able to make separate checks for the different families, and able to keep the orders correct. Didn't have to wait too long for everyone's orders to come out as well.  Overall, I really appreciated how they were able to accommodate our large party, and the efficiency of the servers. This made it very nice for the girls to just hang out, laugh, and some bonding, and for the parents to relax and visit with each other.  One of the better CF locations.

My wife and I ordered the gumbo and chicken carbonara.  Our son had the kids grilled cheese sandwich.  The gumbo was creamy and delicious with a little kick of spice to enhance the flavor.  The carbonara was great with the addition of the chicken.  So ask to add it.  The kids grilled cheese was too much for our son, he liked it, but had to take home the rest of it home cause their was two sandwiches cut into sticks.  Obviously if you're here save room for the BOMB CHEESECAKES.  Overall the location at the Gardenwalk is great with their service and food choices.  We were not disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=540

This is one of my all time favorite restaurants.

Missy A.,"Orange County, CA",18,48,14,5.0,7/6/2013,"Five stars for their happy hour! I came here with a friend after work and we were both super impressed with the selection of appetizers and cocktails for only $5 each!  What we had: Avocado Eggrolls - the eggrolls were super creamy and perfectly crispy! I don't care much for the sauce they come with since it is sweet. The avocados are flavorful enough that you don't even need sauce anyway. Fried Macaroni and Cheese - Delicious...simply tasty little er.. BIG fried balls of oogey gooey cheesy goodness. I like the marinara sauce they garnish the plate with too. Adds a little more flavor without being overpowering. Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip - Your usual artichoke and spinach dip. Couldn't taste any cheese really, not very creamy. The chips weren't the greatest, but I may be too critical because I'm used to the real deal tortilla chips. Roadside Sliders - The meat was cooked just right and the buns were soft. Normally I need cheese on a a burger, but improvised with putting a little of the spinach dip on it. Tasted delicious, especially dunked in ranch! J.W.'s Pink Lemonade - YUMMY! You have the option to get their cocktails ""skinny"" which is 150 calories or less. I tried it and was very pleased with the flavor. Couldn't really taste the alcohol, but don't let that fool you, the drinks aren't weak. Cosmopolitan - I think I've only had one other Cosmo in my life which was a while ago since I can't remember. I decided to refresh my memory and try theirs. STRONG. Not a bad thing, but I remember why I prefer other cocktails. All in all, the food and drinks were good and cheap!

Paul F.,"Buffalo, NY",198,116,1767,2.0,3/7/2013,"The tough part about being carless and in an area like Disney / The Conference Center in Anaheim is, the most accessible places are all chain restaurants.  Making matters worse, schedules and the preferences of the people that you're with limit options. I ended up going to this particular Cheesecake Factory twice. Once it was late night.  This is the positive side of this review; they were open later than most of the other restaurants in the area.  The food was ok, the service on this particular night was good. Here is the down side; went there for lunch today and had the exact opposite experience.  Service was less than good, an appetizer ordered was delivered to the wrong table and not corrected until our entire meal was almost over (yes, they comped it off the bill).  I ordered a Chicken Parmesan sandwich, and there was practically nothing right about it.  The chicken was over cooked and dry, there was virtually no sauce on it, the cheese wasn't melted and the sandwich was served luke-warm. Other members of my party ordered salads, which were huge.  Literally, huge.   But to me, this is not doing lunch right.  A business lunch should take an hour and 45 minutes to get through.  You shouldn't get a salad the size of a spare tire from a Toyota, and it shouldn't cost nearly $15.  Right sized portions, right priced portions - I really don't care if their menu is 26 pages, if they can't get lunch salads right, why bother? Disappointing, but this is why I avoid chain restaurants to begin with... A two is generous, and it would have been a one if not for the good service received on the first visit.  I believe the server's name was Ahmed.  He did a great job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=540

Ashley went above and beyond my expectations regarding service. She immediately greeted us, set us up with beverages that were never more than 1/3 empty. She anticipated any extras we might need with two kiddos. She timed our meal perfectly and offered us beverages to go when she found out I had a fairly long drive home ahead of me. She was just a great server, so sweet and attentive.  As usual the food as Cheesecake factory was yummy.

Jorja P.,"Anaheim, CA",67,8,,1.0,11/15/2012,"The food was absolutely delicious and the sole reason that I didn't give our experience more stars was because the service was absolutely TERRIBLE.   We had two servers during our three hour stay at the Cheesecake Factory and neither of them was attentive (in our experience).  The three hours spent at the restaurant was not by choice, and we could have been out of the restaurant easily almost an hour earlier if we did not have to wait for our servers to show up to our table.   The first server, Jamie, was at our table four times: once to introduce herself, once to take our drink and appetizer order, once to take our food order, and the last check in was to tell us that we were getting a new server.  Which would not be bad if that did not take one hour.  When we got our food, it was very tasty, but we did not see our new server, Julia, until twenty minutes after we had stopped eating (forty-five minutes after she had been introduced).  We ordered our desserts and immediately asked for our bill when she brought the ordered items.  She did not come back for over twenty minutes, making all of us feel greatful that we carry cash so we wouldn't have to wait for our credit cards.   If we ever come to this restaurant again and end up in either servers' section, we would rather wait for another table to be reseated because it would honestly be a better way to spend time than being ignored at the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=580

The dish my friend had came with rice that was cold and the sauce on the enchiladas was also cold.  We then decided to order the brownie with ice cream thinking this has to be better than the meal but wrong we were because the brownie was hard as a rock we had to use a fork to break it and the menu stated covered in chocolate syrup but we had to search for the syrup finding it under the brownie and ice cream on the plate.

Lisa H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",124,306,17,4.0,11/21/2012,"Yes, The Cheesecake Factory is a chain, but for a chain it is pretty darn good. This particular location is in the Anaheim Gardenwalk, which was right next to our hotel (technically vacation resort, the Worldmark) and we just wanted to walk to dinner.  I pretty much get one thing and one thing only at Cheesecake Factory and that is the Tuna Tataki salad. It is always very fresh with nicely seared tuna, juicy red tomatoes, lovely slices of avacado with nice mixed greens and a soy vinagrette. I can eat that and not feel too guilty about eating gobs of the delicious brown bread they bring to the table. They also bring some french bread, but I only have eyes for the brown bread. It is so yummy my three year old was calling it ""cake"". My mother had the herb crusted salmon and she was positively swooning over it. I don't really remember what my husband ate, but he seemed pretty happy too.  The kids had grilled cheese and chicken strips and they both enjoyed themselves and the portions were generous. The menu is huge and you can find just about anything you might want from American classics to Asian influenced dishes to some south of the border flavor. Oh and most people rave about the cheesecake, of course. Honestly, I don't care for cheesecake. I have had the cheesecakes here and they are better than most, but usually I will get a sundae if I have dessert at all. The hot fudge is pretty decadent and the slivered almonds add just the right touch. The kids ice cream dish was only $1, so that was quite a deal for the little ones. Most Cheesecake Factory locations can be packed and I am sure this one is no exception, however on a Tuesday night in November we had no wait at all. Service was pretty good, although they have seperate servers who deliver the food from the ones who take your order. There was some confusion about where food should go in our section which resulted in constantly being asked if a particular dish was ours. They even tried to deliver meals to us while we were clearly eating dessert.  They have a large indoor eating area along with a large outoor patio. Eating outside in good weather would make for interesting people watching as it is right on Katella at the entrance to the Gardenwalk shopping and entertainment mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=580

Based off visits to other locations, like Las Vegas flagship, they should be better prepared for the larger crowds. The food was great as always. We had the four cheese pasta with chicken, the pasta and sauce was wonderful, however, the chicken was perfectly cooked. Of course we ended the evening with a slice of the white chocolate macadamia but cheesecake, awesome ass always.  Overall, never disappointed with the food. Great place and always very friendly.

I've been to this location, one in Rancho Cucamonga, the one in Irvine and several others. They're all the same I believe. It's a rollercoaster of up's and down's. Cheesecake Factory = Inconsistency, but for some reason I always end up coming back. Actually it's all my mother's fault. It's her favorite restaurant. Thanks ma. -_- Every time I visit Cheesecake Factory though, I notice that they seem to be on top of their game with keeping the place clean and tidy. That's a definite plus in my book considering I'm pretty clean/tidy/organized myself. Honest. Well what I mean by inconsistency, it pertains mainly to the food & service. I'll start with the service. It all begins when you walk through the doors and you're greeted by the host/hostess. Sometimes they can be totally friendly. Other times they can be rude to the max! Same deal applies to the waiters/waitresses. I just don't understand it. Maybe you need amazing timing and a little bit of luck to receive the best customer service. I don't know. The food is inconsistent as well. I pretty much order the same things when I'm here. Cajun Chicken Littles, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, or the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich. Can you tell I like spicy food? :) Anyway, sometimes the Cajun Chicken Littles can be amazing one day, then lame another. They're battered and deep fried, so they're meant to be crispy right? Well it's not like that all the time. I get the feeling that they're microwaved because sometimes they wouldn't be crispy at all! More like soft and chewy. UGH! Grumble grumble. No real complaints about the other items that I order. Oh also, everyone knows that they serve you free bread as you decide on what to order. Don't really care that much for it, but sometimes the bread is stale, could be day old. Just saying. I swear I don't come here by choice. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants to begin with.

Sida B.,"Irvine, CA",58,129,689,3.0,5/24/2011,"Cheesecake Factory used to be my life until their service started going downhill. Either way, I still try to hold to CF because I've had good memories at this chain.  My best advice still at this place is to split a meal. With the complementary bread and butter that they provide, it's hard for anyone (including my big appetite) to even come close to finishing a meal, let alone dessert. However, if you split a meal, enjoy their bread, you'll still have enough room (just barely!) for a yummy cheesecake slice.  Our group got the: 1. PASTA CARBONARA (veggie style, no bacon, no chicken)     - still delicious. I recommend this to anyone who's never had it before. It's heavy, but the garlic-parmesan sauce is fantastic. I still think the bacon gives it a kick, but my friend was vegetarian...so no bueno Mr.Bacon. Next time.  2. GARLIC NOODLES        - my other veggie friend got this. I had a taste of it...meh, to be honest, Yardhouse Garlic noodles on their appetizer menu was way better, plus Yardhouse happy hour offers it half-off, making it $5.  3. PASTA BELLAGIO     - Angel hair with 3-4 thinly sliced breaded chicken with garlic basil pesto. Not bad, I loved the combo of the sauce, however, they must've added extra salt. The pasta itself was extremely salty (my friend and I each drank 3 glasses of water), but the chicken was fine. Maybe it was the Prosciutto that gave it the super salty kick.  Our last friend ordered a salad...but she can't remember which salad it was because she really didn't have much of her own salad...more of everyone else's pasta... Lastly we got the GODIVA CHEESECAKE and the 30th ANNIVERSARY CHEESECAKE. The Godiva one is, you guessed, very chocolate-y. You get over it. But the 30th one, man, it's just...unbelievable. It's layers of the original cheesecake with the chocolate fudge cheesecake, and then with a huge side of whip cream and little chocolate flakes on top of the cake. YUMMY. I always get the 30th. It's too good to pass up.  Also another reason to get the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake: ""The Cheesecake Factory is proud to donate $0.25 from the sale of each slice of the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake sold this year to the national hunger-relief organization, Feeding America (formerly America's Second Harvest).""  Hey, you can now eat and not feel guilty about it.

Carolanne T.,"Redlands, CA",5,7,,1.0,8/19/2015,"I almost didn't want to leave a yelp review because cheesecake factories almost always exceed my expectations. The food is great and the atmosphere is nice as well. Unfortunately no matter how good the atmosphere or food may be a restaurant will only be as good as its staff. This evening me and friends dined at this location after a long day at Disneyland. We were tired, and hungry, so we were looking forward to a relaxing dinner. We were greeted promptly with the soup of the day and asked if we were ready. I asked the server if the bread had any eggs or dairy in it, since I am vegan and was given a snark response by our waitress that of course the bread has eggs in it ""because it's bread"". I felt like an idiot although I don't think she really knew what was in the bread anyways. I also asked for a straw twice and was rudely ignored after bringing only one straw for my boyfriend which she plopped in the water abruptly after several times of asking. She said that she wasn't allowed to bring straws for water, but upon request you should be handed a straw that is preferably wrapped. Our waitress Araka O. was our server and although she seemed to connect to the other couple at our table she was incredibly rude to me for God knows why. I understand if she was having a bad day but if your going to work somewhere that is down the street from The happiest place on earth at least try to fake being nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=600

The person who Answered the phone was rude and not helpful.  He wouldn't give us an estimated time to expect to wait or take our reservation.  We asked if we were there right now, how long would the wait be and he said well it could be anywhere from 10 minutes or 2 hours.  Which is it?   So we decided to drive to the location.  We arrived about 5:45pm on Sunday. We put our name in for 11 people and asked how long the wait would be. They spent 15 minutes trying to figure it out and still couldn't give an approximate time.  The hostess would leave the counter to walk around and look and then come back as clueless as she was when she left.  We ended up leaving and eating at California pizza kitchen right next door. This Cheesecake Factory sucked for their customer service.  Very disappointed.

Kimmy P.,"Garden Grove, CA",357,89,40,1.0,3/19/2014,"MUST READ BEFORE COMING HERE. My friend's and I had waited about 15 minutes to be seated. When we were seated the waiter asked what we would like to drink. Waters with lemon for now please. Sure he said, I'll be back with those. He comes back and forgets the lemon so we kindly remind him. He comes back to take our food orders, a friend ordered the chicken parmesan, and the other orders a pasta and I ordered the cobb salad.  We waited for the lemon and eventually my friend got up and asked him again. (please keep in mind that we're persistent because I am ill and I need the lemon to balance out a taste of metal I have from treatments). He said he forgot and that he will come back with it. Low and behold he came back alright...with three toothpicks and lemons skewed on them that he was holding with his hands. WHY WAS IT NOT IN A BOWL! Doesn't that violate some rules? I ended up not drinking anything and we did not use those lemons. Then our food comes out and my friends liked how their dishes looked and I looked down at mine and I see apples in it...I don't think a cobb salad had apples. So I asked our waiter if this was a cobb salad and he said no, that I had ordered a different salad. I said okay... just miscommunication. I would like a cobb salad please, so he took it back. I told my friends to go ahead and eat without me because I didn't want their food to get cold.15 minutes later my salad still didn't come out. My friend goes up to another waitress and she said she'll let our waiter know. He finally comes back with the cobb salad and as I take out my utensils THEY WERE FILTHY!! There was food stuck to the fork still!! I just wanted to eat already so my friend grabbed another setting from another table. Digging into my salad I still see beans. WHAT..THE..HECK...Since when did a cobb salad have beans?? We were so irritated at this point and I said screw it I'll just take them out. We finished our meal and the bill came. We had told the waiter before that it was our friend's birthday but I guess they don't do anything for birthdays here.  We were so tired and irritated that we didn't even want to order dessert anymore.  Anyway, the bill comes out and we got charged for that mistaken salad. Come on dude....get something right please!! We tell him and he said he would change it for us. At this point I think he knows that he just messed up our whole dinner and asks for the assistant manager or someone to stop by our table. She asked us how our meal was and we didn't want to get him into trouble so we just said that it wasn't what we expected and there were some mishaps. She said she was sorry for our experience and that they would try to improve it next time. No compensation for anything, just that.

They used a lot of mushrooms to fill up the dish. I've also tried a ""special"" they had one night: pecaned salmon with assorted veggies. This dish was beyond awful. The salmon was dried out, the pecan tasteless. It was a disaster to say the least. However, their cheesecakes are pretty good, though they are ultra sweet and heavy. As for service, my experiences have varied. I've had a waitress give some attitude and stink eyes before. But I've also had the staff man up to a mistake and take an item off the bill.

Erica greeted us with a friendly smile and took our drink order and also brought us the bread. We then ordered Fried Cheese and within a matter of minutes it was out of the fryer and on our table. Cripsy, flaky, ooey-gooey goodness. We then ordered our entree's, Hubby had the Shepard's Pie and I had the Skinnylicious Asian lettuce chicken tacos. And  .god. They were delicious. It was the freshest bite of food I had ever tasted. Like the first bite of Spring with the perfect blend of textures, spices, flavors, and crispiness. Hubby's Shepard's Pie was also fantastic. It was dense, moist, creamy, with a awesome sauce, crisp veggies, and perfectly seasoned ground beef. It melted in your mouth. Both dishes just wonderful!! We were never without drinks and Erica checked on us multiple times to make everything was tasting good and that we had everything we needed. Now it was time for dessert. We ordered one piece of Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake to share and it was so creamy, decadent, smooth, fresh, and moist. Excellent combo if you enjoy carrot cake and cheesecake.

Wild Mushroom Flatbread - The flavors on this were just ok.  Nothing I would care offering anyone to try.   Garlic Noodles - A little plain in my opinion.  There is a garlic flavor, but if the name of the dish is GARLIC NOODLES, I would expect more of a garlic kick.  If you are looking for a non-heavy pasta, this would be a good choice. Side Caesar - I love my caesar salads, but this one didn't really make the cut.  A little bland and not much of that caesar dressing kick. Tuxedo Cheesecake - Definitely my favorite flavor I have tried amongst all the other flavors. OVERALL - Was never impressed by this place even from the first time I have ever tried it.  Sure there menu is huge, but even from the many entrees I tried I still haven't found one that makes me want to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=720
Charlotte K.,"Anaheim, CA",19,18,3,2.0,5/3/2012,"Last December I went to the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco so I already knew some cheap gluten free options for myself. The hard part is finding something cheap. Most dishes are average $15 or so but the menu is HUGE so there are options. To drink I got the hot caramel apple cider, which I first had that cold December night. This time is was a cold February night and my roommates and I had just been on Space Mountain 2 times so we were cold. Plus it tastes like apple pie in a cup. For dinner I was feeling a burger so I got the original (also the cheapest at $10) and I got that with no bun and wrapped in lettuce (protein style). It was good but the lettuce to patty ratio was ridiculous. It was pretty much just a whole head of lettuce that someone put a hamburger patty inside. There was WAY too much lettuce. And the fries were good, but just like the fries at the Cheesecake Factory in San Francisco, there was too much salt on them. The service was pretty fast though, but it was pretty late in the evening, around 10 PM. But the food was just 'eh'. The drink however was amazing, as always. -Charlotte ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=720

The first issue was that our food was taking a long time, and the manager had to come out and apologize for our order taking so long to get to the table. We appreciated that, and everything seemed find until my boyfriend found a huge chunk of wax paper in his burger. While I understand this isn't actually harmful, it was very unappetizing and really just made the rest of his meal unappealing. We alerted the manager (making that his second visit of the evening), and while he apologized profusely, we still were charged full price for a meal my boyfriend couldn't even finish.  I found this pretty shocking, and I can't foresee returning to a Cheesecake Factory in the near future, if ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=720

As far as my experience started out  with the most unfriendly greeting from the host,?? we requested to be seated by the bar and after we were seated we ordered two beers on draft which were not cold at all and I hate to send a drink back which I've never done before, but in this case I believe it was necessary and the waitress which looked stressed out was irritated?? Well at this point both me and my other half were a bit annoyed, this is the second time we've come to this location and were disappointed both times. as we were about to leave, the table next to us which was full of employees that looked like they had just finished there shifts were so LOUD to the point of SHOUTING! that my ears were ringing I left with a headache!!!

Vanna C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",76,65,2,2.0,4/25/2013,"My coworkers and I decided to order lunch today and I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. We decided on our orders and my coworker placed the first call stating she wanted the lunch portion of Evelyn's favorite pasta. The less than enthusiastic employee on the phone told her that there was no such dish on their menu. Since this was another coworker's order, she said she would call back with a different order. We were all a bit confused by this because it clearly states the item in the Pasta section of the menu. My coworker decides on a different dish and we call again. This time she tells the guy taking the order that she wanted the lunch herb crusted salmon. He then tells her that they don't have a herb crusted salmon, that they only have a cedar plank salmon. Really?! Ok, she says she will have to call back with a different order. We were a bit baffled. Were we looking at the wrong menu? We did click on the Anaheim location. This time around, I decided to call and make the order. I waited about 30 seconds for the take-out employee to take my order. I started off with asking for the BBQ Rancho Chicken Salad - surely they had that on their menu, right? Yes, yes they did! Hooray. One down, two to go. Next, I asked for Evelyn's favorite pasta. YAY, they DO have it! Lastly, Herb Crusted Salmon. Fingers crossed... Confirmed!  After the order was complete, she repeated back everything to me and offered the complimentary bread. Since it was the lunch time rush, she said it would take about 25-30 minutes. No big deal.  We went to get the food and everything went pretty smooth there and then brought everything back to the office. The BBQ Rancho Chicken salad looked delicious... except for the fact that there was no BBQ or Ranch. We were disappointed for sure. We have all been to various Cheesecakes and maybe the empoyees were new but to not know the menu and pack everything properly was a huge shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=720

If you're going for lunch, definitely get the lunch special portion. The portions are pretty big and I usually have a decent amount leftover. Things I recommend (I like really flavorful and spicy foods): 1. Louisiana Chicken Pasta (it usually comes with bow-tie pasta but you can order whatever pasta your little heart desires! same with all the other pasta dishes) 2. Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (I usually order it w/o peas) 3. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta 4. Chicken Madeira (apparently it's their most popular chicken dish and it's served with mashed taters but you can switch it out for rice if you're asian like me :)) 5. Spicy Cashew Chicken (so good and flavorful! I usually order it without the cashews 'cause I get this mostly for the sauce but if you're too embarrassed to order a cashew dish without cashews, you can always order the cashews on the side ;) - this was a tip that the waiter gave me for cases when there are other people in your party that want to eat the cashews lol) 6.

The food unfortunately is where this review goes downhill. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. The breading was almost gummy and there were pieces that stuck together to make giant greasy calamari clumps. My boyfriend for the shrimp and chicken gumbo which came with absolutely zero shrimp. Other than that, he said it tasted fine, but still when you expect shrimp , it's kind of disappointing. I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken. While the menu didn't specify, I expected a chicken breast with my pasta. I was dismayed to find cut chicken pieces that had random bones and cartilage in them plus extremely fatty skin. The garlic sauce was also kind of bland and  thin so the pasta itself didn't have much flavor to it. Despite our disappointing meals, we of course had to order cheesecake (never gone wrong there).

Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",421,415,27,4.0,2/11/2009,"While all my experiences here have been 5 star - its hard to give 5 stars to a chain restaurant thats next door to McCormick and Schmick's and Roy's Hawaiin Fusion. I will have to keep on visiting and see if it really deserves another star.  I really enjoy the Anaheim gardenwalk. I believe that in this current economy they are probably struggling a great deal. I have seen some Yelpers complaining about how dead Anaheim Gardenwalk is - but is it busy anywhere right now? That being said - Parking is convenient. You get validated for the first 2 hours automatically and then you get another hour from being validated by a the restaurant. Let is be known that you cannot double validate. If your their for longer than 3 hours you pay no matter how many times your card has been validated.  Onto the Factory. I love the appetizers here. BJ's brew house could learn a lot from reading the menu and trying out the appy's here. I have eaten lunch at this location 4-5 times and dinner 4-5 times. But, mostly I come for the appetizers and some occasional cheesecake.  As for drinks - they have a pineapple mojito that is amazing. Its both minty and fruity and refreshing.  They make a creamy and very drinkable pinacolada as well. They blend their blended drinks very well. This is a big issue for me - I hate big chunks of ice in my blended drink.  They have a decent if generic list of wine.  As for starters and appetizers; they have a variety of lovely items. They have also recently added some more small plate items and appetizers. This is key in our current economy as many people still want to go out but don't want to get a 5 course meal.  The calamari here is delicious. Its lightly breaded but a bit greasy. In fact everything I have had fried here is a little greasy. They need to work on fryer temperature management. That being said - the calamari is good and the sauce with it is also quite nice. The corn fritters which are a new item(see picture I uploaded) are very nice. They serve it with a creamy sauce. Where I come from you eat corn fritters with maple syrup but I assume that would be very expensive on a wide scale. Anyway - corn fritters are super tasty and great with a pale beer.  The Tomato and fresh mozzarella salad is amazing. It has a light vinagrette on it. Its served with some greens. Its very tasty as a small plate. I have not had the large version of it. You can see a pic of it that I uploaded. As for the high light and favorite of my trips to the Factory - the Spicy Tuna Roll Tempura. Its a deep fried version of the spicy sushi tuna roll. It has wasabi in it. Its served with a bit of ginger and some soy. I could use a little more wasabi on the side. But, in general it makes my day every time I have it.  As for Entrees the Wasabi Encrusted Ahi tastes both flavorful and fresh. The spices seem to hit just right. I don't recommend the salmon here as it appears to be farmed Atlantic salmon with color added. Eating farmed salmon sends the wrong message to industry and supports bad practices and diseased fish.  They have a variety of pasta dishes that are quite good. One of the best is called ""Evelyn's Favorite Pasta"". The Farfalle with roasted garlic is very good too. It typically comes with chicken but I typically get it with shrimp. Its amazing.  The Barbecue ranch salad is very tasty. Also the tuna tataki salad is very nice.  As for desserts the chocolate cheesecake, the tirimisue cheesecake, the chocolate cake, the tiramisue and the key lime cheesecake are all delicate, decadent, and silky. They are all a bit too sweet but quite good with coffee.  This location is also open pretty late and that's nice when you get out of a movie or a ball game and want to get a bite to eat.  The drinks are a bit pricey and the cheesecake is too expensive. But all in all I have generally had very good experiences here.  I recommend that you go and try the appetizers and have some cheesecake. The Entrees are better at McCormick's or Roy's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=740

HIGHLY recommended to people who love a great pasta. my boyfriend said his was alright, but when i took a bite of his meat sauce the meat was way over cooked it was so tough bleh no my favorite. the drink was great janette recommended it and it was sweet and strong.  so why 3 stars? great service, great food, great drinks, and a great atmosphere...well i ordered the ahi tuna tartar as an appetizer...and it came a couple minutes after my meal...uhmm the point of an appetizer is to have it before the main course. i told her i didn't want it and she understood, also the parking...THE PARKING IS HORRIBLE trust me yelp it. yes the garden walk parking structure has it's own review...it's horrible the first hour is free and after you only get 1 hour with validation so if the wait is an hour you better hurry up and order and eat or else you will pay $3 for each additional hour you're at the garden walk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=740

We live in a rural area and have not been around one previously, so we were excited to try it after a long, fun filled day at Disneyland. WOW, it was huge! Such a large restaurant and staff buzzing around all over. Really dim, but I liked the relaxing ambiance. Our waitress was nice and handed out the menu's. It looked like a book! I could not even tell you how many pages of items there were! I was totally overwhelmed but thankfully when the waitress got our drink order I asked her for recommendation and instead of saying, ""Oh, everything is good"" she really narrowed it down. She gave me some of her favorites as well as a popular choices of customers. It truly helped since I had no idea what to get!  I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas and was not disappointed! I don't remember what my husband ordered but he loved it as did the kids. The portions wee huge! We all needed a to go bag, but could not leave without ordering a piece of cheesecake! They had s new one, I believe it was Oreo. We took a few bites the next day and it was so good! We had a great time, and we really enjoyed our meals, drinks, the bread, everything!

Upon arriving we were greeted warmly and seated right away. Our server Lou did an excellent job of attending to our needs and provided some great recommendations for appetizers. I had the Cuban rolls and they were delicious. Sadly, it didn't pair well with the beer I was drinking. My wife had the beet, arugula and goat cheese salad with the Angry Orchard cider. (I should have ordered this to drink instead). Portion sizes were good and we still had enough room for dessert. We ended up choosing the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups Cheesecake to share. While delicious, we both found it quite sweet. We also found the prices reasonable. All in all a great dining experience.

Savor each bite slowly  to thoroughly enjoy all the synergestic flavors. I ordered the ""Chicken Madiera"" as the entree. It's another synergestic dish of grilled chicken topped with cheese, asparagus, mushrooms and a sweet sauce thats full of flavor. It comes with a huge mound of mashed potatoes.

Jackie K.,"Orange County, CA",67,224,222,4.0,6/24/2011,"This review is solely based on their HAPPY HOUR which is from 3-6 pm. I came here with 2 other friends and we split 4 appetizers ($5 each), which came out to be more than enough food. We had the Roadside Sliders, Avocado Eggrolls (yuuuummm), Mac n Cheese, and a plate of their calamari. The avocado eggrolls were delicious! You get 6 pieces and it's not too fried.. and you get plenty of avocado inside. It also comes with a sweet dipping sauce that was savory as well. The sliders are average (4 very small hamburgers) that are served with pickles and lettuce.  The mac n cheese here totally surprised me! The mac n cheese came out in little rolled up balls that looked like HUGE meatballs. I took one ""meatball"" and opened it up and all this cheese and hot steam was coming out. It was a mac n cheese experience that I never had before..and it was awesome. The baked part on the outside was delicious. Huge plate of calamari that comes with marinara and ranch dipping sauce also pleased my taste buds. It was a pretty good deal for $5 I didn't order any drinks during the happy hour, but I believe drinks are $5 as well (mojito, margarita, etc)  I am not sure if other locations have happy hour, so definitely check it out before you go! This cheesecake factory location is also right by the Anaheim Gardenwalk which is a nice shopping plaza to walk around. You can park in the public parking structure thats located near the McCormicks and Schmicks (sp? it's another restaurant that's right on the street of Katella)and get your parking ticket validated before you leave the restaurant.

Our server was Chris and he was really nice, however there was some miscommunication. When we ordered our food my best friend had ordered an artichoke dip with crab (or something like that) and I ordered the factory burger on whole wheat bread. Apparently the crab dip was not available, which we didn't find out about until the food came, and our waiter said that he could have sworn she ordered the regular dip because he would have informed her of the crab dip not being in season.  As for my burger, it came on sour dough instead of the whole wheat. I didn't bother asking for it to be remade since we had already waited for 10-15 minutes for my order to arrive. I will say that considering how CF is expensive as f***, my burger was actually one of the few things I can say was worth the price (despite it not arriving as ordered). It was pretty big and on the sour dough bread (shaped like baguettes) it looked more like a sandwich, and i could barely eat any of my fries.

Jason A.,"Cerritos, CA",1079,700,1631,4.0,9/8/2008,"I'm a pretty big fan of the Cheesecake Factory franchise, although, this one was particularly nice because of the sheer size and close proximity to my hometown. Before the Anaheim Cheesecake Factory opened, I had to go to the one in Brea or the one in Huntington Beach. Definitely, if ambiance is a major factor in your dining experience, you should go to this Cheesecake Factory over the others in southern California. The food at this location has been on par with my visits to other Cheesecake Factories. I usually order a sun-dried garlic tomato and chicken pasta or the steak diane. I prefer sitting at the bar because I can get seated quickly and get immediate service from either the bartender or the server assigned to the bar. Drinks at the bar are your normal non-happy hour priced fare. So far, they've served all the usual cocktails and beers that I drink, and that's a good thing. The last time I went here was during the peak of the gymnastics session of the Beijing Olympics. I remember the other patrons at the restaurants were particularly critical of the Chinese gymnasts because of their supposed young age and occasional cheers and boos at the judges' calls filled the air. I actually like that kind of social effervescence because it makes the place turn from a formal setting to a more down-to-earth and relate-able place.  Plus, meeting tourists who just came from Disneyland is always fun, in my opinion.

First good point we were seated right away, but it was a Tuesday night at 8:30pm. But regardless we were seated right away and our server took our drink orders and off she went. I just ordered a coke which came in a huge glass but was only refilled twice and empty most of the time. I ordered the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo. Ordered the steak medium. It came with mashed potatoes which are always good eats. The steak Diane was tender but a bit burnt on the edges which killed have the steak. The shrimp scampi was great but I only got 4 pieces of shrimp.. WTH!! The sauce was excellent. I used as gravy for my mashed potatoes. I finished my food within 20 mins and was semi stuffed. So we decide to order the red velvet cheesecake. Its huge of course. The red velvet cake was awesome but the cheesecake was a bit tooo thick or was still a bit frozen. It tasted ok but a bit overwhelming after a few bites. Not sure if I could order that again since it feels like I ate too much of it already. My wife ordered the flat iron steak which was ok nothing fancy the fries it came with were plain and the onion rings were soggy.  So back to the service. She was super nice but kept bumping into my shoulder to get my drink or give me my food. And the wait was a bit long. You ever get to that point while talking to each other in your group and silence falls and you wonder DAMN its been a long time since we ordered. Well yeah we got to that point. I was super hungry.

Yareli M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",123,161,393,2.0,3/24/2011,"I decided to come to this location hoping the experience would be different than the one at Bella Terra in Huntington Beach (which is my usual spot i go to). I decided to throw my sisters B-Day dinner at this one because it looked like it was a great location and it looked a lot bigger than the one i usually go to (Bella Terra - HB) which did not disappoint. Place was huge!! It had so much room i was shocked! But the service is the reason for 2 stars, it should be more of 2 1/2. Of course when we got there we knew we had to wait, the line was huge. Its to expect 30-40 minutes at the Cheesecake Factory. We were seated finally after waiting 30 minutes, i was actually expecting something roomy. I was very wrong. They tried to fit 7 ppl in a booth that fit about 5. We were crowded and the table was not big enough to fit all of our drinks, plates, and food. So i asked the waitress (very nice btw) if she could find us better seating. She let me know she would check and said unfortunately those other tables that were a lot roomier were already being set for other ppl. I actually had to complain 3 times about our seating, until finally she got us a better spot with a lot more room. Also the fact that she was nice and polite about it, thats the one star.  We had already ordered our food and were still waiting, i know we were a party of 7 but i saw other parties get their food a lot quicker. When we finally got our food i was so excited hoping to eat that Louisiana pasta i love so much from there. I was disappointed, the chicken tasted Ok and the pasta tasted blah. It definitely did not have the same taste as the one at Bella Terra. The second star was  because the waitress was nice enough to take care of all my B-Day surprise requests for my sister.  I can say i would not come back to this Cheesecake Factory again, unless one of my friends has a B-Day dinner there. Other than that i will definitely stick with my usual Cheesecake Factory in Bella Terra, Huntington Beach - love it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=760

It was not that packed on a Sunday early-afternoon. We just got done from the park and 3 restless kids.  Could not have ended up with a nicer waitress. She was so considerate and about making our time there comfortable. She was also very helpful with giving us tie bits about Disneyland that we did not know about.  We were definitely pleased.

Rylee N.,"Fullerton, CA",247,231,848,3.0,5/4/2014,"After reading through all the reviews, I came here with very low expectations and ready to argue if need be. Everything ended up being absolutely great! We got to the Factory around 9:45 ish on a Saturday night and I guess while prom was going on? So you would think that it was going to be an absolute nightmare, it totally wasn't! We got seated in less that 5 minutes, when we were told our table would take about 5-10 minutes, so I was really happy about that. Right away, a server came to our table, did his spiel and got our drink orders. My boyfriend did order something from the bar and I thought it was going to take long but again I was totally surprised when he brought it out very fast. The server was really great; his name was George and he was really nice, cracking jokes with us and checked up on us enough to where we didn't have to hunt him down for anything and he wasn't checking up so often to where it was annoying either. The only thing I will say I didn't like was the pricing; I mean, $18 for pasta is a little ridiculous, I like to think of what in really paying for and I don't think any pasta should be over $13 there because it's not THAT huge of a portion, but it is good, and I did go because I had a gift card so that's okay. We ordered the mint mojito ($11) which my boyfriend said was really good, avocado egg rolls ($10.95) also really good and came out about 5 minutes after we ordered, and the jambalaya pasta ($17.50)which came out literally a minute after the egg rolls. We never waited long at all for our food. Everything was tasty and then the cheesecake of course was just the best. With over 34 cakes to choose from, it was really difficult to choose; we ordered and Oreo cheesecake ($7.95) and a dutch apple streusel ($7.50) which the server recommended. Thank god he told us to get that one because it was SO good, it was like eating a carmel apple pie with cheesecake. And of course the Oreo one was amazing because it had layers of cookie, chocolate, cookies and cream and chocolate chips!! These are huge and rich slices so they can totally be shared after a big meal. All and all, my boyfriend and I had a great dinner and a very positive time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=440

My sister and I enjoy meeting up at this location whenever she's working in the area. Even though it's been a while since my last visit, and I can't remember the awesome server's name (but I have a pic), I still remember how great my overall experience was!  My server was cool, laid back, and I let her order for me. As a pescetarian, of course I was in the mood for fish, but I wanted something kind of light but still yummy for lunch. She ordered salmon (I think it was Miso) over mashed potatoes w/snow peas). I vaguely remember this being on the eat light & eat right menu as well and the food was delicious! Judging from the picture, I think my friend had gumbo or something with meat, veggies, and rice.  I'm pretty sure the server ordered us a delicious slice of cheesecake for us to share afterwards based on what we both like (carmel, chocolate, etc).

About 10 minutes later our food comes out.   Chicken with scampi sauce over pasta.  Was very rich and heavy.  A lot of olive oil and butter on my plate.  Plenty of chicken.  Only able to finish half. Son got carbonara.  Pretty good.  Very ""bacon-y"".  Very filling also.  He barely finished half. Wife got miso salmon with white rice.  This was very good.  Salmon had nice teriyaki glaze over it.  Plate had nice tasty miso sauce at bottom.  White rice evened out the saltiness of the dish. Waiter was ok.  They pack your left overs for you.  Park in the adjacent Garden Walk lot and ask for validation at the restaurant.  You get 1 hour free.  With validation you get an extra hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=440

I've always been a firm believer that a large menu makes it harder to keep food fresh but I guess I was wrong in this case. I was kinda feeling like chicken Madeira that night but It sound waaay to heavy for dinner on a Tuesday. I couldn't make up my mind so I went with a burger instead since they never really disappoint. I got the Smokehouse BBQ burger. The beef was succulent to the point where it dripped it's delicious juices all over the place but the onion rings were still fairly crispy throughout my meal. The burger wasn't soggy at all which is kind of impressive now that I think about it. The meal came out with little saucers of BBQ and ketchup that definitely wasn't enough if I were to actually finish all my fries. You'll need to order up If you're like me and love to drench everything in ketchup when it comes to fries and a burger. The pricing isn't too bad either. 12 dollars for my burger which is pretty standard when it comes to ""gourmet burgers"". The experience has changed my thinking of cheesecake factory for the better.

Having never been to CF before, I made a point of checking out the menu online. I knew that this particular location would probably be really busy because of its location -- right smack dab in the middle of the resort area, a stone's throw from Disneyland. So, it's probably smart to figure out what to get before you go. There are no prices online, so I had a few things in mind in case some things were too pricey.  We get to the restaurant at about 8 pm, and it is as packed as I anticipated. There was a bit of a wait for a table, but we were seated within fifteen minutes. We were seated outside, but it was nice because it was quieter outside and there were heat lamps. Our waiter, Jared, was very pleasant and quick. He got our drinks and bread right away, and offered suggestions for food. The food was okay -- we got some burgers that were pretty good, but not worth $12. We got a few slices of cheesecake to go.

We sat outside on the patio , server was nice enough but seemed like he was stretched between serving too many tables. When the food arrived it looked good, and that was the best part of it. It was barely warm , my wife's pasta dish had no flavor whatsoever, she said she could have gotten a better pasta from the frozen section at the grocery store. My dish was average at best.

Julia W.,"Seattle, WA",91,653,336,3.0,3/24/2014,"We were on vaca in the land of Mickey and decided to wander over to Cheesecake Factory even though it required us to drive. Not because our hotel was that far but because we didn't want to torture the little one with more walking after an all day at Disneyland. We GPS'ed our way over to the parking garage and were kind of sticker shocked. It was not cheap so kind of a bummer to get to this strip of restaurants (They had a McCormick's as well as PF Chang's as neighbors).  I hail from land of Seattle where parking 'is' expensive and I was surprised to see that Seattle was cheaper than here.  The lines were poured out onto the sidewalk as well as all seats taken inside the lobby. I was able to snag a seat since a group got seated before us.  Our total wait time was estimated to be around 20 mins. It took about that amount of time so nothing exciting to report there.  What was interesting to see was that there were several people who had pagers that had gone off and still had to wait for a seat once they turned in their pagers. Not sure where the disconnect was but was a little annoying for those people. As for food, we were seated in a booth in the back by the restrooms. Which was ok with me as we had our little one with us and she wasn't feeling well (read: sleepy and on Mommy's chest).  We ended up with two servers for our party of two because apparently they were in the middle of shift change. So that meant that our 'new' server didn't fully know our drinks and he didn't check on us but once. Kind of that annoying side of Cheesecake where they are so large and have every possible seat filled for dinner that you can often be left alone for way too long.  I ordered the BBQ salmon despite getting fresher salmon back home as I was missing home. I was so disappointed to have my salmon come out baked.. with BBQ sauce literally slathered on top post-bake. How I have known BBQ salmon is to be baked WITH sauce on it so it actually marinates and cooks into the fish.

Joey D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",155,453,213,4.0,1/11/2012,"The best default Seriously, this place never disappoints.  I'll start with the negative, because there's really only one and that's wait time.  Since it's so close to the Disneyland Resort, if you hit this place up on the weekend, you could easily end up waiting 1.5 - 2 hours.  It gets crazy busy.  Whenever anything is that crowded, I get really uncomfortable and kind of disagreeable... I'm saying large crowds turn me into a prick.  So I stay away.  This review is based on lunches and early weeknight dinners.  Basically getting a head start on my senior dining lifestyle. Lunches and early weeknight dinners don't really have me dealing with large crowds.  10min wait time max.  The staff here is really friendly and very prompt - I was pretty surprised how quickly everything ran here and how many refills I got.  They easily surpassed my refill standards. The menu is huge and, for the most part, everything on it is pretty good.  Burgers, pasta, steaks, chicken - all super tasty.  AND Cheesecake Factory is still one of the few places to serve a large basket of delicious bread... I could easily fill up on their sourdough and squaw bread. And wife and I can't leave without sharing some cheesecake - I think it's mandatory that you order some.  This is usually a pretty easy decision - the red velvet cheesecake is most wonderfully glutenous thing I've ever had for dessert.  It's perfect size for sharing or if you're going through some issues in your life, it's still the perfect size for pigging out on it by yourself. It's really the best default place in town - large menu with great food and service.  After experimenting with so many over hyped and kind of crappy trendy joints (I'm looking at you, new hipsterish gatropubs like chapter one), I appreciate a franchised solid consistent experience like cheesecake factory.   If you can get around or deal with the crowds, you'll have to try to have a bad experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=460

Teo B.,"East Bay, CA",105,86,23,4.0,1/11/2011,"Cheesecake Factory had made some changes in their menu.. some bad, some good.  One of the good changes was adding the seared tuna tataki salad. The salad was just the right amount, the wasabi vinaigrette was versatile.  You can dip your tuna in there or put it in your salad. You can't go here without ordering cheesecake duh! So we had the banana creme cheesecake and it had fresh banana on the side and my friend ordered the vanilla bean cheesecake.  There's just too many options that you gotta try something different each time you come here. Other cheesecakes that I really like is the 30th year anniv. cake for the chocolate lovers and it has those caviar balls that melts in your mouth like the malt balls but mini version and the Red Velvet cake with white chocolate in it.  Did someone say the magic word?

Cheesecake Factory's food is good and pretty consistent with other locations. There really hasn't been anything I didn't like. My only comment is that if you are looking to order items such as Pad Thai or Beef Ribs, you are better off eating at places that specialize in those types of meals. But, the nice thing is that there is a wide variety of items to choose off their menu.  As a suggestion, if you are looking to try a good cheesecake, get the Red Velvet Cheesecake! IT IS SOOOOOO GOOD!  If you plan to dine here on the weekends, expect it to be busy. After all, it is located at the Anaheim GardenWalk, which is near Disneyland.

Stacey A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",33,75,22,4.0,10/28/2010,"Service My boyfriend and I went here on a very busy night. Despite the excessively busy restaurant, our waitress was the most attentive, helpful and social waitress I've ever had a restaurant. It was almost as if she was standing just off to the side of our table and knew exactly when we needed her. I didn't expect as great of service as we got with a full restaurant. Dinner I ordered a passion fruit mojito and the incredible grilled eggplant sandwich. The Mojito was D-licious! The grilled eggplant sandwich was huge and messy. definitely requiring some extra napkins (and it wasn't the mojitos fault). The bread got a little soggy from the juice sandwich, but besides all the messiness the flavors that came out of that sandwich would make your mom's home cookin' cry. Yep, that good. I would definitely order that again. Dessert I will have to admit, I'm not a huge cheesecake fan. I'm more of a pumpkin pie fan. So, I was delighted to see that they had a seasonal Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake that just came out 2 days before I went there. I was a little skeptical because I imagined that the cheesecake would kind of neutralize the pumpkin flavor and that it wouldn't be very pumpkiny. The pumpkin flavor was not drowned out in any way. I'm no longer a pumpkin pie fan. I'm a cheesecake factory pumpkin pie cheesecake fan. The pumpkin flavor from that cheesecake may be even stronger than an ordinary pumpkin pie. It was beautiful and delicious. The best ever. Dessert #2   ;0) Don't call me a fatty just yet. It was actually only a couple bites of my boyfriends Banana Cream Cheesecake. Oh my...this cheesecake will play tricks on you. It makes you think ""yum banana cream""...then the aftertaste hits you like a wall, and you're thinking ""OMG banana cream fiesta just exploded in my mouth!"". Watch, order it and you will see what I mean. It's gooood. Pricing Definitely not a place to go for a cheap date. Food is really good, you get good portions (leftovers) and it's worth the price, but the prices are not cheap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=800

It always baffles me how you can have a super busy restaurant and still get ice cold, crappy food. Buffalo wings were so cold that the sauce had congealed on them. The gumbo was cold as were all of the pastas. Our waiter was OK, although dull and lifeless. But the real topped was the rude ho that delivered our food - wow. The table was cram packed with dishes that needed to be removed and she pops up with huge pasta plates bitching ""Fettuccini""?? Well, clear the table first, idiot. Instead, she stands there simply repeating herself like we are deaf.

The inside is the same as every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Dark, rich colors, warm feeling. The bar seating for happy hour is tall tables and wicker type chairs, and also stools at the bar.  Nonetheless, it's pretty reasonable price wise. Most of the dishes are between $4.95 and 6.95, and most of the special happy hour drinks are $5.  I went with a party of 6, to sit in the bar area for happy hour. Everyone ordered a plate or 2, and drinks. About half of us were happy with our food, the other half was not, mostly due to the same complaint: not enough flavor.  I had the pink lemonade, which was good, no complaints there. And I also had the potstickers and a pizzette (which is essentially pizza bread with a thin crust).

They couldn't. Oh well, we went anyways. I told the hostess as he went to the restroom and she said she would tell our waiter. It took FOREVER for a waiter to even show up, then took forever to come back after bringing us drinks. Then our 2 appetizers--my pick, the mushroom lettuce wraps and his the ahi tuna poke--also seem to take unusually long. In fact, our ahi never turned up (even though that was his favorite thing on the menu) until his entree arrived. I asked about it, and she said she would bring it and I had to ask her to instead bring my entree because his pasta was ready but my salad wasn't...strange...

Then I saw an empty table which would fit our party of 9 and asked the manager why could she not seat us at that table. She then dumbly said that ""that table is reserved"". Well, I thought that the time quoted over the phone is the time that we get put on the waiting list? Those people who ""reserved"" the empty table I pointed out were not even there yet so how could they have been reserved a table if they have not arrived ergo, their names are not yet in the waiting list? Why does she have the gall to tell us we have to wait and we came at the appointed time (4:15PM) and the people at the empty table would be seated RIGHT AWAY as soon as they arrive? It makes ZERO SENSE and she is an idiot. The portrayal of the bimbo-like character of a typical Cheesecake Factory staffer as ""Penny"" in the Big Bang Theory is pretty accurate. The only thing is they are dumber in real life and unlike Penny, they are unattractive. Anyway, I think I know what it is. It is plain and simple racism. Look at the reviews. Most reviews that fall below 3 stars are of those who are not of the white race. I have heard of this Orange County BS about this thing going on. Never mind that I earn a lot more in a month than the manager earns in a year. I just stormed out of there, brought our entire party to PF Chang's next door where we were seated right away, the staff and manager were very friendly and the food is vastly superior and flavorful. If you want real service and satisfaction, go Asian.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=820

I'm a fan of burgers, so I was a little disappointed. My boyfriend got a pepperoni pizza with a Cesar salad. The pizza tasted frozen. We ended up eating just our salads.

They have you wait for your table like most cheesecake factories but at this place you wait twice. once you get called they put in a different line with other people who have gotten called and you have to wait again until the server gets you to your table.

Anyway - our server (Wendy) did a remarkable job considering she seemed to be serving customers in three different sections. Even as busy as she was, she made it a point to walk by and check up on us which was greatly appreciated.  My friend and I split a Kobe Burger and Stuffed Mushrooms (Appetizer). On the Mushroom order - there's lots of cheese. Being from Hawaii, I love things salty but there seemed to be so much cheese that it was like stuffed with nothing but salt. My friend liked it though so I let her have it and I continued munching on the bread. The Kobe Burger was good, not great. Juicy, not dry and the flavors of the meat combined with the mushrooms and I think onions made for a tasty late night snack.  We must have shared at least half a dozen or so Green Tropical Iced Tea Sweetened. We didn't even have to ask - Every pass Wendy made at our table, she'd bring us another.

Tamara T.,"Santa Ana, CA",413,913,2115,4.0,1/16/2012,"I eat at A LOT of Cheesecake Factory restaurants and since this one  is in my own backyard I have high expectations for them because they're across the street from the world landmark, happiest place on earth, eyesore for some and eyegasm for most...Disneyland! That being said, I can tell you if you're from out of town and you want to eat somewhere that gives generous portions, fancy ambiance, and at moderate prices then you definitely need to eat here because you'll get your moneys worth.        PROS: Food's pretty much on point every time and they have a VARIETY of items to choose from and have a page or more on just chicken, pasta, meat, and fish dishes as well as an array of appetizers. There's a happy hour Mon - Fri from 5 - 7(?), dessert options are all good, wheat and sour dough bread to start are always filling and refillable. They also offer a skinnylicious menu that's under 570 calories (plus or minus) and I had two chicken items and a hamburger off of it and I can say it's deliciously filling for being part of a healthy choice menu.    CONS: Service is never consistent and I'll give this location in particular a 77% average of everything going well without some sort of waiter error or kitchen mishap, but this is sub par for Cheesecake Factory.  KEEP IN MIND: WAIT TIME CAN BE AS LONG AS SPACE MOUNTAIN: If it's a holiday or a weekend and it's dinner time, expect a 30 - 40 minute wait time, but majority of the time that's not really the case it's usually about five to ten minutes less.        *On a busy day I suggest finding a spot at the bar section if you can. The bartenders are pretty nice and I've received the best service from the guys at the bar AND you're in front of the T.V's so if you're into sports that's a plus.  APPROXIMATE COST: To give you an idea money wise for two people, an appetizer, two entree's at about $15 each, two cheesecakes, and one strawberry lemonade and one water came out to $62 total. Average meal runs you approximately $10 - $13 for burger dishes, $15 - $19 dollars per person for pasta or chicken dishes with steak, shrimp, or fish entrees at about $18 - $25. I guarantee you a party of four can walk out with a bill of at least $120. I know for a fact you could spend the same amount of money at any one of the restaurants at Downtown Disney or inside Disneyland or Disney's California Adventure park and you'll get maybe a soda, chips, and a corn dog.      Definitely eat here versus anywhere in Downtown Disney or the parks if you want more for your money. Again, three stars is my personal standard for the restaurant itself, but for the location it's the best place to eat on the block.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=520

I've had several friends come through over spring break to take their kids to the park.  We met some of them at Cheesecake Factory for a meal. I hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory forever --- probably 4 years -- and I wasn't overly excited about going, but it was convenient.  Although it was filled with tourists, the wait wasn't too long at the time we went -- early evening -- and it is always pleasant to get a good server. I was surprised to find a kids' menu here because I've been to Cheesecake Factory many many times before and they've never had a kids' menu before. I'm guessing that they have so many kids go through this location that required them to offer a kids' menu. I ordered my usual dinner sized Cobb salad. My friend got the seared ahi tuna salad while the kids got the pizza and grilled chicken with mashed potatoes with carrots. The food as usual comes in huge portions. It tasted okay.

The waitress asked if I wanted to take the soup with me and I said no. I guess she could tell how I felt about it because she also admitted it was a little baby food/poo- esque.

Let me start of by saying I'm not a fan of the cheesecake factory at ALL. The SF location always has a ridiculous wait time and the food is never really worth it. With that said, I had low expectations for this visit. We started off with a couple cocktails. Hubby had the ultimate margarita and I had the cucumber martini, both drinks were perfect. There were soo many menu options that we decided to just split a few small plates: -Tex Mex Eggrolls -Spicy Ahi Tuna Rolls -Seared Tuna Tataki Salad (this was my fav, one of the best salads I've ever eaten) This meal really hit the spot. Everything came out quick and was cooked to perfection. The service was also good. There was no wait time for our table and our waitress was personable (but not overwhelming).

Richard M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",61,39,,1.0,8/27/2014,"I have been to nearly every cheesecake factory between mission Viejo and Hollywood. So the LA county and Orange County. This is by far the WORST cheesecake factory I have been to.  To start, the entire restaurant was empty when we got there and they sat us down right next to a loud party in a corner.  That was already uncomfortable. I asked if they could move us away from them and they said they couldn't do it. Alright fine we waited for them to leave and we were fine. Except for the fact that all their dirty dishes were left there the entire 2 hours we were there. Bus boys not working there or something?  Not one thing was done right. Waited about 10 min to get our drink orders taken. Appetizers (fried macoroni) came out cold,  and swimming In sauce.  Bread came second (they didnt even bring it. They asked if we wanted it)  at that it was cold and uncut.  None of our plates were taken away (incliding appetizer plates and bread basket) until the dessert came. Our food came out burnt, fruit was sour and has gone bad. Ordered fies....those came out cold. Did I mention we got absolutely no refills?? The dessert was the only thing that was done half right. The half was correct was the half where the cheesecake tasted good and was brought out quickly. The wrong part is that we told them it was my friends birthday and they did nothing for them.  There is a cheesecake factory just a couple miles up the freeway in Brea. They have not messed up a single time  I would strongly encourage that you go their as you will get the service that you paid for.

My business partner and I had just finished a convention nearby and were looking for something open at 1030 on a Sunday night. Even though they were about to close, we were still promptly seated next to a window seat, specifically requested since we were indoors all day, and had an amazing server called Sarah-May (sp?). We were never rushed, harassed for the cheque, or treated differently.  Whenever I go to a Cheesecake Factory, I get the exact same thing - the pan-seared salmon over angel hair pasta, capers, and spinach. It tastes as good as it sounds, but unfortunately this branch did not have it on their menu. I ventured to ask Sarah why, and she said they'd try to make it for me without a moment's hesitation.  Venturing to the kitchen, she asked her manager about it, looked up the recipe from another Cheesecake factory, and made it exactly to spec. Talk about imitative! I have not experienced better service like this in a long, long time. Most other places would've said ""well, this ain't that other branch"" over some finger snaps and sass. Overall, I cannot compliment Sarah-May and her crew enough for giving us nothing short of an extraordinary, amazing end to the night. These superstars definitely put the S in Service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=620

However, it always rounds itself down with other stuff. Prices are little higher than many other typical american restaurants and the food is ok. I have been to cheesecake factory a LOT of times in many different cities and it never once blew my mind away. I almost think that if cheesecake factory focused more on desserts, esp cheesecake, instead of so many other different lunch/dinner menus, it will be more successful... like The Melting Pot! Sure you can have few select good dinner menus - perhaps recommended by the customers? - but just focus on the thing you are good at: DESSERTS.  I rather eat cheaper, better food elsewhere and go to Cheesecake Factory for desserts only.

Sheppard's pie - looked great - tasted great. til you eat the vegetables and some of the beef, it was just so saute with sauce in some parts and other parts would be so bland i don't now if this was done wrong but my friends say it taste like that all the time Cheesecake has also been a hit or a miss honestly they makr great regular cheesecakes but at other times the othercheesecakes it taste so unflavorful  all in all its good but not worth goin often or anything like that",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=860

So let's jump into the food my favorite part. Our first trip I had pizza and salad which was ok the veggies on it were bland and it could've used a lil olive oil n seasonings. I picked @ my kids chicken tender meal, yummo. My husband had pasta the usual he always asks for a mixture of alfredo and tomato to be mixed, he's a chef. He likes what he likes. Next visit me n the hubby shared I forget the name but it was a giant plate of chicken strips and mashed potatoes. It was filling! My daughter had the cuban sandwhich and the meat was absolutely tender. The other kids split a club sandwich which is no regular sandwich here, huge, served with fries.

It was seasoned perfectly and was served with a tomato based sauce... very good.  For my entree, I had the Meatloaf and mashed potatoes which were delicious and reasonably priced ($14.95.) The dish was so big, I got 2 delicious meals out of it.  For dessert, we shared the Strawberry short cake. And this is what got the cheesecake factory their 4 stars. This dessert... WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! They don't mess around here... they built a beautiful pyramid of Vanilla ice cream, pillow-y short bread, fresh strawberries and clouds of whipped cream.

ME :  Shrimp Scampi and Diane Steak(spelling)  $20 substitute mash Potatoes for snow peas-First time I had shrimp scampi where the 4 shrimp were fried. Steak was odd, instead of a nice big piece of steak it was 4-5 cubes of meat.  They were cooked perfectly though, a little crunchy crust peppery crust and then pink-red juicy on the inside, laying in a bath of steak juices (forgot the name). Would have been better if it were one nice piece of steak instead of mini ones.  Snow Peas with veggie stir fry was sad, way too salty and some had the hard stem still attached. ENDING: To full for cheesecake so decided on something lighter ( so we thought). I was contemplating between strawberry short cake and the lemoncelle; yellow cake layered with lemon marscapone top with strawberry.  Waitress recommended strawberry shortcake out of the two. Strawberry Shortcake $7?......Take me back. It was hugest strawberry shortcake I've ever seen. With the three of us (other two in our party were sadly diabetic; didn't stop us) we barely managed to finish it.. So it looked like this: about 1/2 quart (4scoops) of rich and creamy vanilla ice Cream sandwiched between two perfectly warm, slightly salty (balanced the sweetness) huge, golden yellow shortcakes with about 1/2 foot tall mountain of whipped cream (fiancee loves it) and then...then the strawberry of all strawberries, perfectly glazed and sliced, stuffed all the free roaming space between the sandwich and plate's lip.

But, today I ordered the Roasted Eggplant Sandwich (in the burger section) and I had to write a review to tell you not to get it. It wasn't horrible but it also wasn't delicious. It was also extremely difficult to eat. The bun is all wrong for this type of veggie. I picked it up and everything slipped out the bottom. The eggplant was a little too al dente so I had to cut it with a knife to eat it. I liked the flavor but it would've been much better with feta cheese. It comes with garlic aioli on the bun but I asked for extra and I dipped the fries in it. So, yummy! Better than ranch dressing any day!. I got the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake for dessert and loved it. It is so tart and yummy that you just can't stop eating it.  I was bummed to find out that the add gratuity for 6 people, I thought is was only parties of 8 or more. Our waiter was so slow and we kept looking for him. FYI: My fav is the Carmel Chicken. If you're craving chinese food then order this. I do think it's weird that they call it Carmel Chicken because it doesn't taste like carmel at all. It taste like a crunchy sweet chicken but I don't get carmel at all.

First, our waitress wasn't very pleasant but more so seemed that the restaurant industry wasn't where she belonged. My fiancé ordered the salmon and shrimp scampi that was a huge plate of mashed potatoes, a couple shrimp and a small piece of salmon. Friend ordered the Cajun pasta that was bland, her boyfriend ordered the shepherds pie which was extremely salty and he commented that it was the gravy. The waitress wasn't very nice when we told her and then she asked with an attitude, ""well, what do you want me to do then?!"". She then got the manager and as my friends bf was explaining the saltiness, the manager interrupted and said ""it's the gravy that's salty."" So the manager new that it was salty and they still served it and if he knows that already then it's an on going problem. My friends bf ordered what I got, the gumbo. His came out as I was finishing and they looked nothing alike. I had there jambalaya before and it was good, but wanted to try the gumbo for its broth. I had substituted the rice for linguini in the gumbo and it was good but not enough shrimp and the andouille sausage was grounded almost instead of nice, plump round pieces. We all noticed the gumbo dishes didn't look the same; his was a nice red broth and mine wasn't even the same color, so we all came to the conclusion that I had received the jambalaya. What a shame that the only thing that was great was the free bread, the avocado egg roles and they didn't charge for the shepherds pie or the second order of ""gumbo"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=920

They come to work looking beautiful, elegant, nicely dressed, and they make them clean. Me thinks that is very cheesy of the cheesecake factory. I'm sure they have enough profit to hire people to stay on top of the cleaning who are not required to dress in a way thats not conducive to their duty.

Mitchell M.,"Anaheim, CA",1,21,15,4.0,12/19/2010,"My wife and I love this place. Many a hard earned dollar has been forfeited over to the Cheesecake Factory but mainly this one. The service can be hit or miss. It does not matter in the slightest if they are busy or not. The food is, on average, is great every time. I would suggest: * Pasta Carbonara - It is my favorite item there. I get it with extra peas and sauce. I suggest skipping the added proteins (chicken or shrimp) as they are not cooked in the sauce and therefore just taste like unseasoned chicken (or shrimp). * Chicken White Bean Chili - Great flavor, the chicken IS cooked in the sauce, and it is one of the most affordable items on the menu. * Renee's Special - Basic soup, salad, half sandwich combo. You are left at the mercy of their soup of the day (Mushroom is probably their best) but you can sub it out for another side if the soup doesn't do it for you. Get the tossed green salad instead of the standard salad. It has a little bitterness and slight peppery taste but significantly better. The half sandwich is a turkey or chicken salad option (get the chicken as the turkey tends to be dry). * The stuffed mushroom ""small plate"" is an appetizer but they do not call them that as their apps are bigger portions and create bigger checks. Stuffed with bread crumbs, baked, sprinkled with parm, and served in iron clad vessels with a madera sauce. Just make sure they are not too stingy on the sauce. It is great. * Cheesecake - You probably can not go wrong with any of which you choose. Keep in mind that this place is called ""The Cheesecake Factory."" If they could not pull it off they would be called, ""The Place With a Large and Varied Menu"" and that would be strange. Things not so great: * Shepard's Pie - It is not a Shepard's pie but a cottage pie (Shepard's pie is lamb based). Aside from the misnaming, it is dry and is overloaded with thyme. * Jumbalaya - Too much bell pepper in the trinity. Seriously, just go to the market of suckle a raw pepper (98¢ instead of 14$). * Fish and Chips - Not a bad dish but just boring in comparison to virtually EVERYTHING else on the menu. * Monte Cristo - They serve this for breakfast instead of lunch+ where it belongs. It is not tasty and it is not a true Monte Cristo. Very sweet and egg heavy (because they put egg in it).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=920

Here's the kicker .. which I never knew .. Cali state law requires big chain restaurants with 20+ restaurants nationwide to give nutritional facts with the menu. So Red Velvet cheese cake eaters ... you are eating well over 1000 calories and 58 grams of SATURATED fat .. so can you imagine the total fat if saturated is 58?? YIKES  Our server was Chris, he was really nice and friendly even though we just got desserts. A lot nicer than the servers in Chicago.

Noel B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/22/2016,"I'd like to begin with saying that the Cheesecake Factory is by far the best restaurant I have ever been to. This restaurant is utterly clean and it's absolutely gorgeous inside. It's very comforting and it makes me never want to leave the place. They've always greeted customers immediately after they walk in, from what I have observed and experienced. The workers here are extremely friendly, and sometimes I feel as if it's impossible to take a smile off their faces. I usually go on the weekends so it does get very busy, however every single time I've gone they've made my waiting time enjoyable. They do this by inviting you to sit by the bar, and throughout this time you have a waiter/waitress who takes care of you up until your table is ready. Once your table is ready and you've been seated, it doesn't take very long for a waiter/waitress to come over and begin offering drinks, appetizers, and helping with any questions you have. Also the waiter/waitress brings over such tasty bread. I wish I could take a slice home with me. The menu is everything you could ever imagine. There's so much to choose from, which is great because other restaurants I've been to your options are limited, or the dishes are all similar. Your food is out very shortly regardless of the amount of people they have. It's usually anywhere from 15-30 minutes and your waiter is checking up on you throughout this time. I would recommend getting the pasta carbonara",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=680
Kristin W.,"Buena Park, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/22/2016,"This place seems to be busy which is a testament to its popularity. Once you walk through the doors, they always greet you immediately making you feel welcomed. Once they can narrow down the meal choices, the food is always good. From the Fried Mac and Cheese Balls to their giant salads and bowls of pasta, it's all yummy.The service was great. When my boyfriend and I went there for a date, we actually ended up with 2 servers because our previous server was no longer working. But the other server was very nice and friendly. The prices are pretty decent. The bigger the plate size, the more pricey it gets. I believe that they food is good anyway so it's worth it. The negative thing about this is the place is that it's always packed (even on week nights) since it's next to Disneyland. The parking is a paid lot, but it's free with validation if you don't forget to bring your parking ticket. What I like the most is the cleanliness of this place. Everytime when I go use the restroom, there is always a clean bathroom and clean mirrors to look at when touching up your makeup or something. It is very crucial to have a clean bathroom because no one wants to go to a restaurant that is filthy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=680

Appetizers: -Fried Mac n Cheese - fucking YUM. I could eat them all the time! -Ahi tartare - sooooo yummy! With little pieces of avocado and crisp wonton pieces to pick it all up - DEEEElish!

ATF! I always get it with mashed potatoes instead of rice. Fucking amazing, I could eat it daily. White bean chicken chili - A bit spicy, served in a big bowl with rice. I always get a side of sour cream to thicken it all up and cool the spice a little. Another favorite of mine :) Shepherds Pie - YUCK. Bleghhh.... Barf. No thank you. Maybe Im just used to my dads home made pie, but this one has NOOOO flavor. Even with a ton of salt and pepper, nothing works. Ewww. Louisiana Chicken Pasta - yummy! Nice and spiced! I always ask them to add corn, cause you know... corn makes anything better. lol Dessert... Funny thing is, I normally dont get dessert when I go.

Claudine S.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,1,,4.0,10/10/2011,"A Big Treat Your Taste Buds Will Never Forget  It is funny how us humans have the same amount of chromosomes and same DNA, but look different and like different things. There are people who are always in the mood for anything that come to mind, not very picky, then there are those who know exactly what they want and how they want it. Finding something that agrees with ones taste buds can be difficult, but that is why there are many restaurants carrying different foods from different cultures so that anyone can feel comfortable with their own surroundings and familiar foods. Having  customers feel comfortable at a restaurant is one of the most important parts in running the business.  The first time an individual dines at a restaurant they are experiencing for the first time of how the food is going to taste or if they will be receiving the service of their expectations. What they should tell themselves is to never judge a book by its cover or from what they have heard from relatives, friends, family, etc. First time customers should try it out themselves in order to receive their own experience. As American citizens, we are exposed to various different cultures and ethnic foods that are enjoyed by many people. We have adopted the cooking from our ancestors in which many chefs use at their restaurants. One of America's well known restaurants, The Cheesecake Factory, serves a combination of appetizers, lunch specials, and entrees in which they have incorporated into their menu. Because of their wide selection, they have been able to continuously grow and succeed. They have a huge selection of different types of food for customers who are in the mood for anything, even with picky eaters.  The purpose of food critics is to judge the different meals served to customers and rate them to help improve the business and customer satisfaction. The customer service at a restaurant must be at its best in order to receive returning customers and excellent reviews. The  Cheesecake Factory is one of the best restaurants known around the world, everyone who loves cheesecakes will love what else they have. No one can ever go wrong with Cheesecake factory. Most people today have become accustomed to bored, frustrated, underpaid hourly workers, which recite the necessary obligatory words with no interest at all in helping the customer. It is nice to see someone with a genuine smile and always cheerful because it makes others feel the same way and makes their day and they enjoy the rest of their meal even more. One of the most important details about a restaurant is not only the atmosphere but the view and theme of each diner as well. Many customers enjoy the friendly environment that comes with  dining at The Cheesecake Factory. Because of this, not only do customers return, but by the word of mouth, friends and family are notified about the restaurant. This not only brings more customers but also positive reviews and dining experiences. What many like about The Cheesecake Factory is the fact that they have a vegetarian part in their menu. Many people have become vegans and so they have decided to have a whole menu just for vegans and what is good for them which is astounding. Not all restaurants have put a vegetarian part in their menus, but you still have the choice of ordering salads, soups, and they even have sides of any vegetable you would like to order.  Nevertheless, everyone should always just try different things and eat at different places, never judge a book by its cover or even by what people say sometimes. The Cheesecake Factory knows exactly how to lure people in with their advertisements, famous cheesecakes, and their remarkable food that everyone loves. Realizing the differences between restaurants is very simple, there are so many different ways to represent ones place and if anyone goes to the same restaurant but in a different state, they are expecting the same thing and usually does come out the right way. The Cheesecake Factory knows how to make me people want more of their food and they make so much of what you are having so that you are able to have it to go and enjoy your food at home sitting on the couch watching your favorite movie.  The Cheesecake Factory never lets their customers leave their restaurant unsatisfied, they never fail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=960

Anhie M.,"Westminster, CA",214,105,237,3.0,12/17/2010,"Contrary to Kellee N.'s review, I actually like the Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach better than this one. I've been to the location in HB a handful of times, and this was my first visit to the location in Anaheim. As some have mentioned, it's located in the Anaheim GardenWalk right down the street from Disneyland. After a long day at the theme park, I was starving, so we opted to go to the GardenWalk. It was a Wednesday evening, so it wasn't too busy at all. The boyfriend and I got our usual appetizer, Ahi Carpaccio (thin slices of raw ahi tuna, wasabi pesto, creamy avocado and togarashi aioli). He wasn't too hungry, so we shared my favorite, Hibachi Steak (certified angus hanger steak with shiitake mushrooms, onions, bean sprouts, wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus).  When our Ahi Carpaccio came out, it did not look fresh at all! The tuna did not have its usual pink tint, instead it was starting to look brown. It seemed like they gave us thicker slices to compensate for the lack in quality. Now, I'm not too sure if the color of the ahi tuna would suffice (it's debatable), but it did not smell or taste fresh either. When my steak came, the dish was missing my asparagus. That wasn't too big of a problem, our waitress brought it out on a separate plate. About one fourth into my steak, I realized that it was bleeding when I ordered medium well. My boyfriend insisted it was just the piece I was cutting into, but I'm sure I saw the red meat even with the lack of lighting in the place. Oh well, we didn't want to bother to send it back. During the meal, my boyfriend's ice tea glass went empty. We watched as our waitress repeatedly passed our table to see if she noticed the empty glass. After a good 20 minutes, she finally came out with a pitcher to refill his drink. Overall, my experience was just okay. The food quality and service seemed to lack a bit, but it might just have been a bad day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=960

The Gardenwalk - an outdoor mall in central Orange County (because we were running low on those) - is visually appealing, though our linner/dunch did not permit much time to browse around the location.  Of the many restaurant choices here - Bubba Gump, McCormick's, P.F. Changs, et al - we defaulted to Cheesecake Factory.  It's my favorite back-up place, I will say. It's a chain restaurant, in the same way that Walmart is a ""multi-unit variety store"" (i.e., it's everywhere), so I won't comment further on the food.  Our booth had Cheesecake's reliably backbreaking super-upright seat backs situated nicely next to the server station, where we could hear all the amazingly interesting details of what the staff was going to do once they finished their shifts, as well as how much or little every table tipped them today.  Excellent. The service was fine - reliably efficient and relatively well timed, friendly but still reassuringly formal.  Hearing specials or features, such as the Red Velvet Cheesecake (which they unfortunately did not have), was good.  Boxing our own leftovers was disappointing.

We were greeted by our server who from the start did not have a very friendly approach. You could sense her coldness and she never smiled once during our entire visit.  We started by ordering our drinks. A couple beers, an Odouls and a kids chocolate milk half full (we have a toddler so he tips it and spills it if its too full) and easy on the chocolate. She came back with a chocolate milk that was extremely chocolatety and had to be returned and a Becks instead of Odouls which she advised you did not carry. My girlfriend does not like Beck and she returned it. Not sure why the waitress decided to take it upon herself to bring something else. Next we ordered our meal. I ordered my sons kids pizza and asked if he could get sausage. She went back to the kitchen to ask and confirmed I could. Never did she say that there was a $5 charge for sausage on a kids pizza. Really? Almost the cost of the pizza itself?! Completely appalled by this! Next my pregnant girlfriend orders a Filet mignon medium in doneness. The Steak came out completely rare and had to be sent back. Later we ordered another round of drinks , specifically another Stella Beer. When she brings the beer to the table we immediately notice the color of the beer was that of a Blue Moon or Shock Top. She insists that it is the beer we ordered and after tasting it confirm it was in fact a Blue Moon or Shock Top. Returned the beer and just told her to take it off the bill. I had to ask her several times for straws she never brought to the table since my son had dropped his on the floor. I also asked for a refill of my sons chocolate milk to which she proceeded to tell me there was no refills. I told her, that when we sat down I told her to only fill halfway so he wouldn't spill and I would take the other half later. Once I reminded her of that she brought the chocolate milk. But she again just had a really bad attitude about this! Upon our getting ready to leave I stopped a manager, didn't get his name but he appeared to be latin or middle eastern with a close trimmed beard. I told him this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had and that our waitress had a really bad attitude and was not friendly at all. His response, let us know when you are back. I told him I wasn't from the area and I would probably never be back. He basically just briefly apologized as he was walking away from me and told me next time to address it at the time of dining and walked away from me. To spend almost $150 to have a nice meal and have this kind of service is completely unacceptable! Like I said before, we dine your restaurant often, at other locations and have never had this kind of experience.

Darcy D.,"Vancouver, Canada",13,132,2,4.0,11/19/2012,"I am looking for reasons not to like The Cheesecake Factory. Chain restaurants have a boring menu but, theirs is very up to date with many modern techniciques and presentations.  Chain restaurants have trouble with quality control but every dish tastes the same at every location!  This chain has an absurdly huge menu so, some of it must be bad but, every dish I've ever tried has been, dare I say, memorable.  Chain restaurants look dull but, they have high ceilings and modern decor. I hate it when servers keep coming back to the table over and over to say ""is everything ok? do you need something else? you must try some dessert!""  and this is exactly how the these servers are trained to do there jobs.  Thankfully I can take a star off for over-attentive servers. Otherwise I would have to give them a 5-star, because the value is great, the portions are huge and the ingredients taste as close to homemade as I have found in a chain.  I always cringe on the outside when people say, let's go to the Cheesecake Factory but, I always agree because inside I can't wait  for the endive and walnut salade, and the pear & blue cheese flatbread, and the avocado spring rolls, and the marinara spaghetti, and the ...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=560

I do not, however, recommend their Vietnamese Spring Rolls (they really need to consult with a Vietnamese chef for this dish).

Neil P.,"Fairfield, CA",1,47,1,2.0,8/5/2014,"Visited on a Wednesday night after a Disneyland day.  I had a $25 giftcard, and I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory.  Figured on vacation in SoCal was a good a time as any to try it out. Unfortunately, it wasn't all that impressive. Place was swamped when we walked in around 6:00pm.  Quoted 30 minute wait, but it turned out to be closer to 45.   No issues with service, we had two servers who handling everything better than we could have asked for.  Always refilling drinks and bread without us having to ask. Kitchen.  A bit slow.  There were six of us, and after ordering the waitress came over and told me they were out of the Chicken & Biscuits I had ordered.  I had to get a menu and re-order.  Then, after snacking on bread for a good 20-30 minutes, by replacement order arrives, but without the rest of my family's orders.  Not sure how that happened.  But it was a solid 10 minutes before the rest of the food came.  So I was faced with either starting to eat before the rest of the table, or eating cold food.  Ordered the Steak Diane/Shrimp Scampi combo.  Good steak, but only about 4 pieces, and three shrimp.  Something like $19.95.  Overpriced for a plate that was mostly mushroom gravy. Second food run brought all the food except for one.  A manager came over and told us my daughter's pizza had been burned, so they were making another.  A bit inconvenient, but not a serious problem.  But then I looked at my son's pizza, and it too was burned.  They served him a pizza that was black around the edges and dark brown/crunchy on the bottom.  Our waitress saw it and immediately offered to make a new one.  I was glad to see her take the initiative so I didn't have to send his food back to the kitchen.   Whoever was in charge of the pizza oven needs some retraining.  It was bothersome that they held back one burned pizza and remade it but served another burned pizza. In all, it was a mediocre meal that cost over $120.  Certainly not worth waiting as long as we did.  I felt bad for our waitress, since she was busting her hump to take care of us and the issues were with the kitchen, not the service. I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, and I didn't see anything that would make me want to come back. I've sent a copy of this to their corporate office, no response as of yet.  I'll update if they respond.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=660

J C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,74,4,4.0,12/14/2012,"I ate here twice last week. The food is hands down some of the best tasting food I've had outside of a 5 star restaurant that charges $75 a plate. Of course the Cheesecake Factory is much more reasonably priced, around $15-$25 a plate.  I had the Moroccan chicken one night, which was a grilled chicken on top of a bed of pearl couscous with some type of creamy tomato sauce. I don't live anywhere near a Cheesecake Factory, but I can tell you it will be worth the 1 hr drive to go there to get this dish next time I go out to dinner. :-P I also had the second night the sausage and broccolini pasta, which was incredibly good but turned out to have a bazillion calories so I only ate half of it for dinner and had the rest for lunch the next day.  My only complaint about the restaurant which is why I knocked them down a star is that they don't have the waiters and waitresses bringing out your food so there are no checks to make sure your food is correct. Out of two nights of dinners for two people (4 entrees and 2 desserts), they messed up 3 of our dishes. For example, I didn't actually order the Moroccan Chicken, I ordered the Tuscan Chicken. But the Moroccan Chicken is what came, and once I started eating that they weren't going to get it back!! Also, they put onions on my husbands burger when they weren't supposed to, and they gave us the wrong type of cheesecake for dessert.

The 4 cheese pasta, spicy chicken pasta, and fried Mac and cheese was amazing. The prices are decently priced for a high end restaurant. We spent the same here as we did at IHOP. For 2 entrées, 2 appetizers, and a cheesecake it cost about $70. Sunday brunch we both ordered the regular Belgian waffle with a side of bacon. The best waffle and bacon we have ever had. HIGHLY recommend it. Their coffee is very good If you like strong coffee. Brunch cost about $30. Our dinner experience service wise was better than our brunch experience. Both servers were polite but during brunch it seemed like the waiter had a difficult time keeping up with the tables. It took him a long time to come to our table to get our drinks and then after that we waited at least another 10 min.

If you are looking for a no fuss place for lunch or dinner, I guarantee you that cheesecake has something to please your palate.  You get your best standard casual franchised fine dining. Every location, always looks good, always tastes good.  Choices, choices! Too many choices!  My favorite items?  Chicken Costoletta, lightly breaded chicken breast, sautéed with lemon sauce,  served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Discovered on date, and a favorite ever since!  My new favorite item?  Tuscan chicken from the skinnylicious menu, grilled chicken breast with artichokes, tomatoes, capers, basil and a vinaigrette. Served with veggies and farro (looked like rice).   You get all the bang with portions but you can finish the dish and have guilt free dessert afterwards!  Cheesecake? My biggest complaint is that they discontinued my favorite cake, the tres leches cheesecake!  I'm not so picky anymore and open to try whatever my party desires to split.  Not a fan of cheesecake, like my best friend, then we go for the chocolate truffle cake, which is rich and layered with different chocolate variations from mousse, truffle and ganache!   This location has a mix of family tourists with kids running around in their crocs, casual locals grabbing a bite or some dressed up hotties looking to splurge!

Jen T.,"Gulfport, MS",134,273,487,2.0,5/30/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites no matter if we are in Denver or Hawaii- with that said I am leaving and I think THIS Cheesecake Factory can really kiss off right now. Sixteen of us, they hand us our bills, ask us if everything is correct and I notice my salad is $2.50 more? I had told the waitress to make sure I had blue cheese in my salad because the last few times I have ordered it there hasn't been too much- well I get the chopped salad and the works pizza and have a ton of leftovers and I have not had any complaints really . Well that stupid charge they put on was for 'extra' blue cheese' and the waitress said 'sorry, that's for extra cheese'  and she did not offer to take it off even after asking all of us if the bill was correct. So I asked the lady manager that seated us and I got the same reply, 'oh I'm sorry, yes we do charge for proteins and such' okay wow Chresecake, you are kidding right? Ha ha, our lunch planned with 12 of us tomorrow is going elsewhere- it's just the principle, we spend a lot of money and always choose this restaurant everywhere we go. I am officially putting on my no go list for the meantime. I absolutely hate the nickel and dime BS- we travel all the time, have a huge family all over the Country, and even at home, we eat out all the time. I do not expect anything for free, but I like to know if there is an additional charge for items- oh yeah, I just wanted to have blue cheese on my salad that says blue cheese- Whatever- I am over it and I just don't want to be aggravated when I leave over $2 when we dropped over $350.

A friend had gotten there an hour and a half before our meeting time and was still in line 10 minutes before the birthday boy showed.  PACKED on a sunday night at 730? really?  The food was good but I'm not sure how much of that was attributable to the restaurant or me. I got some bow tie pasta with caramelized onion, peas and chicken. It was good. The dinner salad was okay. The guacamole was good, but the chips were terribly stale and /or over fried. The service was downright terrible... my friend ordered coffee which showed up 45 minutes after she asked for it with no cream or sugar. That took an extra 10 minutes. Same friend's shrimp tasted soapy and so they comp'd the entire meal. Still, I'm sure she'd rather have been able to enjoy the shrimp than get free pasta.

From the detail of the restaurant's decoration to the welcoming smiles that surround you while you're dining, when you're there it's not like you're just dining at any restaurant, it's a special experience that keeps you wanting to come back for more (even though you don't have room for any extra meals because the proportions are already so large).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=880

First time, met up w/ a friend for lunch...definitely reccomend ordering the lunch miso salmon...soo tasty, and the perfect portion for a fair price. =) The last time I went here was after another day at Disneyland w/ the boyfriend for dinner, we thought we would have to wait at least 30-40 mins. considering the crowds that were waiting outside..but we got seated within 10-15 mins...probably cus it was just the two of us. The service was great..kinda funny cuz' we sorta felt like tourists cuz' most of the people that come here for dinner are from out of town! haha I usually stay away from ordering the pasta b/c I remember not enjoying the pasta da vinci before..but I decided to try the bistro shrimp pasta...and it was really good! the shrimp is slightly breaded & has a lemon cream sauce w/ arugula, mushrooms, garlic, and some other veggies. It's a pretty massive portion too! For appetizers we ordered the roasted artichoke, it was pretty good, but nothing to go all crazy over. Ooh and when they bring bread to the table just ask for the brown bread..b/c it is awesome and waaay better than the sourdough....and if you got room for dessert, definitely order the tuxedo cheesecake!!! =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=880

Alicia H.,"Temecula, CA",80,69,36,4.0,4/21/2008,"Note, my rating is based on service, a drink and cheesecake.  The menu scared me, being pretty high up in the funds area.  Alas, I had already prepared for such a thing, eaten dinner elsewhere, so as to leave room for the cheesecake.  Whew! For months I walked by The Cheesecake Factory in Downtown Seattle and never stopped in or even had any interest.  Actually, it wasn't until recently that I discovered they sold food in addition to cheesecake. Yeah, I'm quick. It took a long-time friend's trip to California from Canada to take a gander at the place.   My friend and I walked over to the Factory from her hotel and met another there where we were promptly seated.  Nice big tables...sweet!  Our server was friendly, quick to rattle off the specials, yet didn't treat us with disdain when we informed him we were only here for drinks and cheesecake.   I indulged in a J.W.'s Pink Lemonade which turned out quite alright though didn't rock my socks off.   We finally ordered our cheesecakes after an hour at least, but our waiter was extremely patient and very helpful. Being that I am very picky with my food, especially deserts, my desire for a delicious yet simple cheesecake was time consuming and yet my the waiter answered every question and possible mix of menu choices in a pleasant manner.  He even offered some suggestions but eventually I settled with the Snickers Bar Chunks Cheesecake.   See, I had to have the graham cracker crust and some caramel but once I saw the Snickers option I was sold.    Cheesecake was devine, but they did deliver it with the fudge on top when I'd asked for no fudge.  The waiter apologized but I was in a good mood so let it go considering it was only a slight drizzle on top, not swimming in it.  He did forget my scoop of vanilla ice cream but was quick to return with it as soon as I pointed it out.   I am usually quite annoyed by mistakes which I mentioned but perhaps my excitement of seeing my friend helped me overlook them.  In reality, they are very minor and did not affect the night as a whole.  Nonetheless, I loved the creaminess of the cheesecake, the perfect crust and the fact that they didn't drown it in fudge and topped it with enough caramel and whipped cream to enjoy with each bite.   What really sold me was how long they let us stay in our booth, talking talking talking, until 12:30AM.  We were the last ones out of the place other than those who worked there and they were very sweet about it.  A not so subtle turning on of the overhead lights and we realized they were waiting on us.  I felt bad, but at the same time much appreciative of the gesture to let us stay as long as we did.   I doubt I'll ever return to this location, but I have a feeling I'd indulge in their cheesecake somewhere else at another time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=940

When I worked in Vegas we use to go to this place all the time and I feel in love with there food. I have to admit that over the years I have tried quite a few of their menu items (there is 240+ of them) but i do stick to my fav witch is the pasta Devinci. It is something you have never tasted before and I would dare you to try it. Now the big thing for me in a chain restaurant is service. And I think the cheesecake factory dose an amazing job with keeping their standards very high and exceeding them. This is a busy place so I recommend it if you are going out for a nice dinner but not really looking for a romantic evening. Although I have made a romantic evening out of a cheesecake factory its just a big place. Tip: When they bring you the bread order some of their house balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Use it do dip your bread in. This stuff is the bomb. I have a jar at home and is good on everything I have tried it on so far.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=940

Well, I do. I hate the colors, décor, the size they make these shit holes. I hate the fact that there has to be a ""theme"" in these ""New American Cuisine"" establishments and that if you really take a look at their menu that they've stolen just about all the good ideas that come from other cultures. I hate that every time I end up at a place like Cheese Cake Factory that there is ALWAYS, ALWAYS at least a 40 minute wait. And I hate that the waiting area has so may people just milling about like cattle that it gets claustrophobic. It's like being at a club and someone killed the dj and no one knows what to do with their selves. I hate the size of the food that you pay ridiculous amounts of money for, and of course you're paying 2xs more for a salad or plate of pasta, because that's just what it is. A salad that can easily feed 2 people. A plate of pasta that can feed 2 people. So yeah, it's gonna be about 30$! Retarded!!! Why don't they just give you a salad and pasta that feeds 1 person and charge half the price? Because that what gluttonous Mickey Mouse America wants. BIG BIG BIG!!! BIG SHINY SPARKLEY VOMITOUS MASS of GARBAGE! And that is just what Conglomerate Corporate America is shoveling to us. All wrapped in a pretty package with a bright purple, pink and orange bow. OK. Now that I've gotten that out of system. So you ask: If you hate it so much, how did you end up there? And I say: Because we were curious about the area and PF Chang's had a 40 minute wait too and no one wanted fake Asian food. So it was CCF or Bubba Gumps. Aw, hell NO. CCF. And then you ask: How is it that you gave them 3 stars Kione? And I respond by saying: I hate the fact that we got damn great service when we were finally brought to our table. The busser/runner/whatever he does, helped us set up the table that in a way that would be more convenient for my sister-inlaw and my 1 yr. old nephew. He was so damn accommodating. I hate the fact that our server had to be so efficient and professional and charming. I hate it that the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls that we got as a starter and the French Farm Salad with all the beets, feta and arugala that me and one of my brothers were sharing had to be so damn tasty. And I especially hate their cooked to perfection ginormous juicy hamburgers that you have to literally have to have jaw that unhinges like a python's and leaves you feeling like you ate the whole cow, like a python. I hate the fries. No, serious, really. I hate them. It tastes like deep fried packing foam. No! I haven't eaten packing foam, but I bet that's what it would taste like. Duh! Did I mention the service? How much I hate the proficiency and the quick response that we got when my sister inlaw found what happened to be a piece of food sticker/label in her pasta, which she was enjoying. It didn't even phase her, but growing up in the industry my brother and I take foreign objects in food as a serious matter. We brought it to the attention of our server and immediately the floormanager/supervisor was there to apologies and comp her pasta. ""We didn't want...we just wanted to let you know, so the kitchen can be more careful."" The manager told us not to worry about it. Cool. Did I mention how I hated that the server was efficient, thorough and really organized and in control of her table? And just so damn nice? Yeah, I hated that. I hated that we all had a great dining experience and that the food was pretty good, because all in all I can't hate this place as much as I would love to.

I'm at a loss as to how this chain has remained so damned popular. It blows serious ass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=780
Nhi Thao M.,"Santa Ana, CA",110,243,1810,4.0,3/27/2011,"My boyfriend and I visited this Cheesecake Factory tonight.  It was super crowded, so we just sat at the bar.  We weren't very hungry, so we ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wings appetizer.  Boy, was it hot!  My mouth was about to burn off!  We also got a couple of drinks - I got the Blueberry Mojito (delicious), and my boyfriend got the Eel River Organic Amber beer.  We finished off with a slice of Dulce de Leche Cheesecake.  Our bartender/waitress was awesome!  She noticed that it's my boyfriend's birthday when checking our IDs and she had the cheesecake dish decorated with a Happy Birthday message for him.  She was very attentive throughout our meal as well.  We got to watch some NBA basketball too while sitting at the bar.  Overall, it was a very good experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=780
Sarah M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/17/2014,"The good: the staff is almost always friendly and helpful, and the free bread is yummy. The ""Eye of Sauron"" decorations on top of the pillars- check them out, so nerdy-awesome. The bad: The bar served reasonably priced SIMPLE, WELL cocktails with small, silent tvs for the sports fans. The ambiance is so dark you can't see, (the food, your friends, stuff to trip on on the floor...) and so loud you may lose your voice and I always get a headache. The food ranges from decent to yummy, but is all grossly overpriced. (I was charged $26 for 6 boring grilled shrimp, 1 serving of steamed rice, and 1 serving of steamed veg.) The ugly: PRETENTIOUS menu! ""Glamburgers"" won't make skinny b-words eat a real burger, and ""Skinnylicious"" diet menus!? Who are you kidding? SO gimmicky. Have any food allergies? Don't bother! They could only offer a GF menu, (but like everywhere, contamination is possible). Longer wait times than Disneyland. On a Tuesday night, we were told 45 minutes for our party of 10, but ended up waiting 70. Birthdays? They sing to you over an egg cup filled with mostly whipped cream. They are the Cheesecake Factory, couldn't they use the money from their over-priced cheesecake sales to sing over a bite-sized square of, I don't know, CHEESECAKE!?  If you go there, sit at the bar, don't plan on having an understandable conversation,  get a crazy expensive slice of cheesecake, (they leave the prices off the menu for a reason,) and get out of there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=780
Alex A.,"Sylmar, CA",400,259,24,3.0,3/18/2013,"After hitting Joe's Crab Shack, we wanted desert, so we went to Cheesecake for some carrot cheesecake, about 900 calories, I only knew that afterwords. The slices seemed to be smaller than I can remember, which might be a good thing. So I order my carrot cheesecake and my wife order her white chocolate something and paying $15.00 plus tax, I ate it and then wished I hadn't, too sweet and too expensive, I would of rather had me some Stan's Donuts, really!! I know that I will be back, because, I'm only talking with regret, I would eat the regular cheesecake with strawberries on top next time, so until then!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=780
Marilyn S.,"Artesia, CA",34,8,6,2.0,4/19/2013,"So, I called them on April 5th to let them know that my group was sick. The hostess got the manager and he apologized for our painful experience. He said the restaurant would do a full check of the kitchen and facilities as to what could have gone wrong. He also gave us our money pack in gift-card form. This was great costumer service from the manager and I do plan on going again. I've heard great reviews on the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp :) It's not pasta, but Im willing to try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=780
Cindy W.,"San Diego, CA",1168,638,2049,3.0,3/25/2010,"After finishing 2 days of testing, over 16 hours of sitting in a chair and 500 multiple choice questions I really wanted to let loose! It just so happened that my bf's family was in town and so we decided to go meet them in their hotel around Disneyland. I was very surprised that his very asian aunt and uncle wanted to go to Cheesecake Factory.  Normally FOB people don't really go to Cheesecake Factory and we like to stick with our Chinese food. However, around Downtown Disney there doesn't seem to be much Asian food at all.  After the waitress came, my bf's aunt was trying to figure out what was on the menu, and his very Asian grandparents were confused about the menu and even made a joke saying that ""even though we can't read the menu, we can see the prices""  After about 2 minutes of asking the waitress what was good on the menu we finally all ordered. I had the chicken pesto pasta with arugula and prosciutto. The chicken was breaded in bread crumbs and a little bit on the dry side but all in all pretty flavorful. The pesto sauce wasn't overly salted or too oily.  We also had the garlic noodles which could have had a little bit more garlic. The chicken Madeira is one of their most popular chicken dishes. It has a mushroom sauce along with mounds of mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Service was pretty bad since our party had 8 people and they automatically charge you 18% tip.  But all in all pretty interesting to come with a FOB family :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=780
Lida K.,"Irvine, CA",126,216,9,1.0,4/16/2010,Let me break it down: 20 minutes for the waiter to visit us the first time 10 minutes to get drinks 10 minutes to order appetizers 10 minutes to get appetizers and told us she'll be back to get food orders 15 minutes and we flagged down 3 random waiters to put in food orders 20 minutes for uncooked pasta and steaks not cooked as ordered 30 minutes to get check Bottom line service was ass.  Went there for dinner with friends and ended up staying about 2 hours not by choice.   I don't have that kind of patience.  Maybe you do.  Maybe you'll love this place so much you'll rub your face against the menus as you'll be looking at it for almost a hour before somebody takes your order.  Who knows.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=780

Veronica H.,"Indio, CA",729,323,57,5.0,4/27/2012,"I ordered off of their skinny menu because their usual portions are enormous. I got the chicken skinny pasta and it was very delicious.

Chris F.,"San Francisco, CA",2,167,11,4.0,10/18/2011,"We had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory mid Oct. 2011 during a recent visit to Disneyland.  The restaurant is located about 2  1/2 blocks from the park entrance with free parking with validation right next door for the first hour. For informal dining, this place is fantastic.  The menu is huge and so are most of the portions.  There is a little bit of everything on the menu from salads and pastas, pizzas & burritos, burgers and seafood and on and on.  It is all good and is a nice change from the food in the park.  Everything was fresh and warm for things that needed to be.  They have a full bar and the deserts are great if you are a cheesecake fan.  Our bill was around $45 for our party of 3, with plenty of leftovers to take back for later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=780

James G.,"Long Beach, CA",158,36,8,3.0,5/1/2013,Just OK. I had lunch with 3 friends today and the wait for our meals seemed a bit longer then normal. I had the seared wasabi crusted Tuna and all I have to say was a  large flavorless dish. The portion was large but the flavor was just average and a bit over cooked. Its my second time at this location and I think overall its just OK   nothing special at all.  Not a fan..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=780
Paul C.,"Fremont, CA",49,142,,3.0,4/24/2011,"Seeing that this location of the Cheescake Factory was a 10 minute walk from our hotel, we decided to come here for lunch.  What can I say?  The food is consistent across the company as it is a chain restaurant.  During this visit, I decided on the Farmer's Burger and it was definitely good.  It was cooked medium just as I asked but I notice that it does not come with as much fries as it used to.  The others in my group had the fish and chips and the meatloaf, both which also looked really good.  Typical of Cheesecake Factory, the portions were pretty big that I didn't have room for cheesecake. I would have given this location 4 stars but the service was not what I expected.  Our server came by a few times during our meal to check up on us and we had to ask one of the runners for more bread.  Anyways, I'm sure this was just related to the server we had for the day and I would come back next time I'm in So Cal to try it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=780

Jen E.,"Beaverton, OR",280,264,97,4.0,1/7/2014,"so ...... my family was gathered in CA, where we all started from. We went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner one night ...there was 7 of us and 4 generations..... I have to say the only thing I HATE HATE HATE is how loud the music is when you add that to customers and the acoustics of every one of their places it gets to be very loud and hard for my grandmother to hear anything. With that being said, we chose to sit outside. The waitress was attentive but not hovering, took her time with each and every person to make sure our orders were what we wanted, drinks were what we wanted and that the food was up to par....it was. We all left happy and a little sad we did not get to see Sheldon, Penny, Leonard or any of the rest of the group (and extra points to you if you understood that sentence) I have always loved the diversity of the menu and continue to be astounded that the chefs are able to execute that big of a menu with little to no mistakes",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-anaheim?start=780
Chris S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",12,410,7,3.0,4/2/2013,"Food is okay. Different experiences over the years. I think that the drinks suck and are weak. I do like certain dishes, but you have to ask yourself "" how good can the food really be?"" when there are 300 things on the menu. Some stuff I like(scampi) and some stuff I don't(jambalaya). I guess it depends on what kind of mood. The dessert is great, the decor looks like a Bellagio bathroom. Service is usually okay.
