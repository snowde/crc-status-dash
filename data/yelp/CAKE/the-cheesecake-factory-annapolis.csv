Sabrina H.,"Bowie, United States",5,12,14,5.0,23/8/2017,"I loved the atmosphere. It was very laid back and classy. The waitstaff were attentive but not intrusive. We sat at the bar and watched sports. Our drinks were visually appealing and very well mixed. We had pineapple and a blood orange Mojito. Also a screwdriver. I had the baked salmon with broccoli and red mashed potatoes. They were so damn good, I actually dreamed about them. Seriously, I dreamed about them.  I ordered the strawberry cheesecake.  I kept it simple. It was delicious.  Rich and creamy.  I need to stop because I'm getting hungry smh.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=20
Dave S.,"Annapolis, United States",75,267,22,3.0,29/11/2016,"I dropped my phone and hung out at Cheesecake Factory while the screen was being replaced.  I figured I'd get some work done while waiting, thus the short walk to the Cheesecake Factory.  The hostess was pleasant and directed me to a high top in the bar. Rachel was great and looked after me nicely even though I only had a glass of wine. I have WiFi and AT&T cellular on my laptop. Cheesecake Factory has no WiFi. Bummer. I had to  move across the bar to get even a marginal cell signal. That means no business meals at Cheesecake Factory. The men's room was a complete disaster. A total unsanitary mess. I reported it to management and in fairness it was greatly improved when I used the facilities again before leaving.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=20
Stacey E.,"Baltimore, United States",82,89,35,4.0,23/5/2017,"This place is one of my go too's! I know it's a chain but you get a lot of food and I like food! The options are unlimited, at this location they have outdoor seating and it's attached to a mall! Sounds like a winner to me.  The food is very delicious and the drinks are pretty! No way you don't have leftovers and a possible piece of cheesecake or two in your bag! This place is Yummy. My waitress this visit, she was amazing, polite and attentive.

Jasmine W.,"Upper Marlboro, United States",125,52,49,4.0,10/12/2016,"Always great service here! From getting a slice of cheesecake to dining with friends and family, I've always enjoyed my time. Staff are always attentive and polite when entering the restaurant and efficient when making sure you receive your food in a timely manner. The ambiance is always enjoyable, the lighting is my absolute favorite! As far as food choices, there are TONS of selections. Although, I've been a couple of times, I still find myself having to look over the menu a couple times before ordering. The buffalo wings are classic appetizer and their blue cheese is really good. (Which is actually sold at the front of you wanted to take some home). The calamari is also good. As far as entrees, I usually go for the the steak tacos, chicken Cobb salad or the Cajun pasta. You can never go wrong with either selection.  Desserts...where do I start? If you are a regular at Cheesecake you know that the selections are epic and it would be so much easier to ask to try everything. However, if you had to choose per say, the red velvet cheesecake is to die for!! The snickers in my opinion is right after that! But keep in my mind opinions may be different asking the staff because it depends on the texture and level of sweetness you're into! But getting suggestions from others is always interesting and the best part of Cheesecake Factory! Cheers",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=20
Mariah G.,"Manassas, United States",0,67,51,1.0,19/3/2017,"We hardly eat in chain restaurants because they generally suck, but Cheesecake Factory is an exception because their food is actually good. But after eating the other day, I was reminded as to why I do not like chain restaurants-- food sucked and service sucked even more. This location is probably the worst Cheesecake Fac. I have been to. We were seated right away, but it went downhill from there... Service was really bad, it took forever to get our food order--Our server was so slow and not friendly at all. I asked him to take our group's photo and he said he will be back, but of course he did not return, only when he had to give the bill.  Food sucked! I ordered medium rare for my carne asada--obviously it was not! Meat was not tender and was so salty! While the truffle honey chicken lacked taste. The white rice that came with some of the dishes we ordered was soooo dry!  We decided to just get some dessert in the to-go counter since I really didn't want to deal with our super slow server anymore. wasWe ordered two slices to go and it took the ladies in the counter more than 5 minutes to hand it to us! They were chatting the day away and were so freaking slow, even the lady ahead of us was getting impatient and the lady behind us was complaining how slow they were!  This branch needs to get its act together--but of course since it is inside Maryland live it will always be patronized. Management really needs to train their people or they just do not care since they know it will always be packed. Worst branch ever! I told my husband after lunch that I probably won't be back in a Cheesecake Factory anytime soon.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=20

Nee J.,"Upper Marlboro, United States",45,113,13,1.0,22/2/2017,"I came in on Sunday night (as this was one of the few restaurant that didn't close between 8pm & 9pm).  We were put into one of those 2 person booths.  I hate them--personal pet peeve.   We ordered 2 appetizers, ate, then ordered entrees.  Then the unthinkable happened.  A roach and I do mean a nasty brown with antennas or whatever ROACH walked up the wall we're seated at.  I lost my got dxmn mind!  I mean I lost it.  Ya'll I lost it.  My calm in the storm had to calm me all the way down.  In the meantime as I'm being coaxed back to sanity I lose eye contact with the freaking roach!  You never want to lose eye contact with it.  I mean NEVER!  I scurried away and stood at the hostess counter.   The manager came over (Mike from Bronx with the funny accent)--yeah that's how he introduced himself to see why we got up in a hurry.  I told him why--my level of pissossidy was rising.  This bamma offered me free dessert!  FOH!  Then tells me that a cleaning crew comes in weekly to combat these issues.  I know when to hold them and when to fold them--so I walked out.  I didn't feel like having my pressure rise higher than it did.   I'm done with this location!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=20
Regie H.,"North Beach, United States",0,2,2,2.0,11/9/2016,"Poor service. After being seated with no menus or silverware, we waited 20 mins for a waiter (waitress??). Then another 20 mins later I went to get my own drink and silverware. Finally we ordered. My medium rare filet came out black and crunch and burnt to a crisp and the mashed potatoes were now green beans. I imagine the steak sat under a heat lamp or something for 50 mins of the hour we waited for our food. I never ever complain, send food back or even leave reviews but it was so bad that I am still waiting on the second attempt for them to cook a steak. Ugh. I'm only giving the second star because I've eaten here many times and have always been amazed at how great the food here is.

I went with a party of 6; after an hour of wait time, we were seated.  When we got to the table, we ordered but then noticed our silverware. SUPER DIRTY! There was actually a piece of food attached to my ""clean"" silverware. Unacceptable! We ordered boiling water and placed all of our silverware in the hot water. We spoke to the waitress about the dirty silverware and she said she would talk to her manager but nothing ever happened.  Our waitress wasn't the best but she was far from the worst. Food was good!

First, my waiter got my order wrong and when they replaced my dinner. It was over cooked, burnt and not up to the quality of food I know cheesecake can deliver. I asked to speak to the manager and I asked him if what was served was $22.50 worth of food and he said ""yes"". I was disappointed in him for not displaying good customer service and I made him take the food back and take it off my bill.

The music was extremely loud and added to the loud conversation made the hearing level painful.

I ordered the chicken enchiladas which I have enjoyed in the past. There were a few burned spots on the enchiladas but at that point I was too hungry to bother complaining.

Kaye S.,"Annapolis, United States",0,20,1,4.0,24/6/2017,We came in at 11:30 when there weren't many people there yet. We we shown to a tiny booth at.back of restaurant in sight of kitchen. I believe this happens because we are over 70 and they want younger people up front. We asked for a larger table since they were almost empty and we were placed in a booth on back wall behind the servers even closer to  . If I ask for another change we will probably be out the back door of the kitchen. Nice server. Ordered steak medallions on special menu and husband got chicken parmeasan pizza style. They serve bread while you wait - very fresh. My steak was overdone but still tasty and my husband's was really quite amazing. He loved it but had to take half of it home. It was huge portions.

I have worked in many restaurants and I know how servers should treat guest. She only came to the table twice, and ignored us when we called. She never checked in on our table. She was very lazy and not enthusiastic at all. The food took 40 minutes to come and that was not the issue. The problem was that she never updated us on the food or apologized for the inconvenience. The restaurant was not that busy, nor was there a wait. We ordered a second glass of wine and Cydney never brought it out, never acknowledged the birthday that we mentioned (it was my mother's birthday).

Rae M.,"Bowie, United States",340,377,524,5.0,11/8/2015,"For some odd reason, I've never been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory. I don't eat cheesecake, so coming here never really impressed me. Other than the star, cheesecake, I never knew what they specialize in. The menu is 20 pages long and usually when I order something, I never come out satisfied with the food I ordered.  That's probably why I haven't been here in years.  Well, this time was different, I came with a party of 4 and we had stellar service. Our server, Elizabeth, went well above the call of duty for us. She even brought us to-go cups of strawberry lemonade when we were leaving, without us even thinking to ask her. She threw out a few suggestions for us and gave us her personal opinion on a couple of food options.  We couldn't have asked for a better server.  We ordered the fried mac and cheese for an appetizer and they were phenomenal! I'm upset it was only four on the plate, so I only ate one.  SIGH!  I ordered a basil and chicken pasta dish that was really good.  Everyone else ordered cheesecake and I ordered a few slices to take home to my parents and they enjoyed it. Apparently, it's the best cheesecake around.  Finally!  I was able to order a few dishes that I actually enjoyed enough to come back. I even peeped several other dishes that were new to me, that I wouldn't mind trying in the future. Excellent visit!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=20

We were going to go for one of the high top tables near the bar. Waited around for between 5-10 minutes for someone to come by and clear the table. The staff decided to clear the table at the back end of the bar first, where nobody was waiting. Another group jumped up there before we could. Plenty of waitresses and the hostesses walked right by us and made no attempt to clean up. Two hostess standing at the counter waiting around didn't seem to care. When my girlfriend asked the hostess why they did the empty table first, she looked up at the back and just made the ""eh"" movement. Waited around for another few minutes and no one came over.

Lucy C.,"Severna Park, United States",0,5,3,1.0,11/2/2017,My family and I don't usually indulge in cheesecake but we decided upon getting some from here the other night. We were excited to eat the slices we bought but we're immensely disappointed to find that they were dry and unenjoyable. Certainly not worth the cost per slice. The next day we returned to the store to speak with the manager about the quality of the product and to maybe get our money back- we certainly didn't want another piece of cheesecake after our terrible experience- and he told us that they sold thousands of slices a day and never got any complaints. Terrible customer service. We will not be returning to this establishment again.

Marissa H.,"Coram, United States",2,4,,1.0,14/9/2017,"I usually really enjoy my meal when I visit the Cheesecake Factory and have no issues with gluten. However, this time was very different. My mom and I ordered the same gluten free pasta dish I always get. It came out and looked very different. I asked the waitress if they changed the recipe and she said no. It was tasteless and extremely liquidly. The waitress asked if we liked it and we explained that we thought it was terrible but we were hungry and in a time crunch so we would eat it. Very nicely she called over the manager, who said yea that looks different I'll take it back to get fixed. At that point I said I didn't have the 20 min to wait and I no longer wanted it. He took the plate and left. Terrible business sense, a good restaurant would have at least offered a free dessert for the inconvenience.

Courtney K.,"Annapolis, United States",357,1748,2174,4.0,12/1/2016,"Bottom Line:  Huge menu, big restaurant and frequently long wait times. There are very few chain restaurants that I really enjoy but The Cheesecake Factory is one of them.  What I appreciate about this restaurant is despite having a ridiculously huge menu book with something like 20 pages, everything seems to taste good.  I'd love to watch the action in the kitchen because the kitchen must be quite sizable with a large staff. Also large are the portions whether it be a salad, iced tea, pasta dish or slice of cheesecake. The atmosphere here is ok.  I've never understood the decor that Cheesecake factory uses and how it relates to the restaurant but that isn't an issue.  I do wish the tables were a little farther apart because sometimes the high density of people, coupled with many hard services, can make it very loud in here.  Unless you have an empty table next to you, there isn't an opportunity for private conversation here.   The cheesecake here is good, but some flavors are certainly better than others.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=40

Clearly under staffed I don't know how she could keep a smile as the tickets eventually drowned her. At 7 the manager finally helped out. It was a painful unnecessary example of poor staffing.

Valeria, the server, literally NEVER stopped by for more than  a split second before saying 'I'll get right back to you.'--and then proceeded to keep walking by and ignoring me. I was literally shocked. It happened again and again. When I told her, 'This is beginning to frustrate me--you never stop to ask what I need, you keep saying you'll get right back and never stop to talk,' she copped a MASSIVE ATTITUDE.  She is so stupid I had three leftover plates and she only brought one small takeaway dish. Can't even do basic math.  Rude and started taking dishes away while I was still sitting there preparing to leave, though there were other things she could have done...this was just to be intimidating.

K T.,"La Plata, United States",2,98,89,2.0,20/1/2016,"We went here on a Sunday afternoon, around 12:30ish. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, which wasn't bad at all.  Once we got seated is when it all went downhill. Our server was friendly enough, but very inattentive. Drinks came out one by one and then sat empty for long periods of time. It was close to 15 minutes after we sat down before he finally stopped at the table long enough to take our lunch order.  After putting in our order, we waited for our food for around 45 minutes. Why we sat there that long I will never know. Our waiter rarely checked in on us, again, drinks remained empty. Bread basket, empty.  When the food finally arrived, it was absolutely not worth the wait. My better half ordered an omelette, toast and potatoes. The toast was burnt, the omelette was tiny and horrible tasting. My son got the mini corn dogs and he seemed to enjoy them.  I ordered the Mac n cheese burger. Which was awful. The Mac n cheese was basically flavorless mush. I asked for my burger to be done ( a risky move, I know). What I got was a burnt, shriveled chunk of meat. Inedible without loads of ketchup. I also ordered sweet potato fries in place of regular fries. Initially they sent out the wrong fries. The waiter was apologetic however it took another 10-15 minutes for the correct fries to come out, and they were overdone.  Not impressed, and we probably won't ever go back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=60

Pep P.,"Alexandria, United States",0,68,,2.0,4/7/2017,Came before 6 pm and only had to wait for 10 min for a large party table. Hostess was nice upon entering but immediately noticed how dirty the restaurant was. Why was their trash visibly on the floor? The bathrooms trash can was also overflowing. The worst of it all was the table we were seated at- there was a glass salt shackled that had broken on the floor. I asked three times for someone to come and clean it- they didn't. It wasn't until my niece got a small piece stuck in her thigh while she was seated in the booth section- I guess the shaker smashed all over. They need to take their time and clean all areas of the restaurant and tables after a party has left. The manager did come over and made sure we were okay but didn't do a thing other than give us a bandaid and antiseptic.  Mind you this all happened while we waited well over an hour for our food! That's crazy. The waitress was good and she wasn't to blame for anything. I really liked the flavor of the shrimp and pineapple chicken Asian dish except for the white rice- it was horrible- Chinese takeout rice is better. Parts of it was hard and dried out. You should at least be using jasmine rice and a nice rice cooker. Good grief.  I will say my husbands special rib burger was very flavorful and so were the cheesecakes- they were as good as I remembered and I appreciated the waitress splitting a piece on two plates with all the same fixings of whipped cream and side of cherries on each side.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=60

This location is pretty standard in terms of decor but needs a bit of TLC - our table was delaminating which kind of grosses me out thinking about bacteria living in the substrait of the table.  Anyway....unlike most CCF's, we weren't made to wait for a table (no matter how many empty tables there are they always make you wait, just like Olive Garden) and our service was fast, efficient and friendly.  I do like that they have a fairly big selection of ""healthier"" choices but you still need to be sensible. Ordering a ""under 500 calorie"" app plus a ""under 600 calorie"" entree still equals a lot of calories. They don't post individual calorie counts per item so you just have to guess that the turkey burger is better for you than the ""healthy taco plate"".  Speaking of my turkey burger, it looked like it might have been hand formed & the taste was above average. Sadly, the side salad was super gritty (like the greens were dirty) and had a lot if wilty, yucky looking bits. CCF does serve up some superior iced tea - 3 choices, in fact & all unsweetened.  Overall, this location = better than the average CCF.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=60

Decided to sit at the bar and to my surprise there was no one minding the bar. So I scooted off to wash my hands and came back and still no one there. I'm guessing since it was a thin crowd and one of the servers had enough time to watch at least ten minutes of the game that eventually someone would surface. The bartender came back (I guess from a break) and she was pleasant and helpful in her suggestions for late night noshing. I wanted fish but didn't want to be overly full since it was after 8p. I got the catfish, mashed red potatoes, corn and green beans. I immediately knew that I'd be eating the other half of this for lunch the next day.

If the lack of attention to cleanliness is any indication to how they act in the kitchen, I am sure I'll be sick in the morning. They need to do better than this.

Joe C.,"Bowie, United States",5,32,4,4.0,21/7/2015,"I ate here over the weekend.  I love this chain and its novel-length menu, but my number one recommendation for every restaurant I've ever reviewed is to only go in their off-hours.  For any Cheesecake Factory attached to a mall (which has been all of the ones i've ever been to), this means steer clear of Fridays-Sundays.  Only go between 2pm-4pm Monday through Thursday.  We came at about 3pm on a Sunday, and wrongly assumed that at such an odd hour, it wouldn't matter that it was still technically the weekend.   Our wait was only about 15 minutes, but the hostess hadn't asked us how many were in our party; she saw two of us while our third was on a phone call outside, and assumed two.  So when our pager went off as a table for 2 had opened up, they crammed us into the section of a different waitress who was already in the weeds.  She was friendly, but it was almost fifteen minutes after being seated that we finally got our drinks; in fact our bar drinks were delivered by a bartender before I got my iced tea.  My empty glass sat for more than five minutes at a time throughout the meal.   I asked a food runner to bring me a refill, and her response clearly reflected that she was either new or also in the weeds herself: ""I got other things to do.""  I'm a prior food service man, so I understand that food runners are supposed to take stuff from the expediter and get it to the tables, and aren't the ones you ask for sides of mayo or to put in another appetizer order, but she COULD have gotten my refill as we were seated right next to the server station.  I could've poured it myself if I wanted to break from propriety. The food was as good as any other time I've eaten there, with one exception. I am a fond admirer of appetizers that wrap foods in other foods and fry them; my favorite here is Tex-Mex Eggrolls.  I had to wonder if these hadn't been properly wrapped (assuming they wrap them in-house), because even after they had been brought to the table, I bit into my third one or so and was greeted with scalding hot oil on the inside of the egg roll. When they were fried, a good amount of deep-fry oil must have gotten trapped inside and remained boiling hot even ten minutes after coming out of the fryer.  I will still order them every time I go here, but shame on you fry cook! My enchiladas were delicious.  Not as good as I make at home, but for the convenience and price, they will keep me from ever having to make them.  One of my dining companions got the  Shrimp Gumbo over rice and cleaned his plate.  I can't remember what my other companion got, but she talked us into NOT getting cheesecake for dessert, in lieu of carrot cake.  I kid you not, carrot cake!!  Get the cheesecake, America.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=80
Fernando G.,"Bladensburg, United States",0,5,1,2.0,7/4/2014,"I liked the food at The Cheescake Factory for what it was but it doesn't live up to the hype.  First, a group of 3 and I waited for a table, which was not an issue, but when were seated our server came to our table only 3 times, to take the order, leave drinks  and check without us asking. A table across was receiving more attention than ours.  Second,I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp with rice and mango salsa. The shrimp and mango salsa were good but It was forgettable.  Third, I enjoyed and savored the Passionfruit Margarita and happy it was prepared with real tequila, Milagro not Patron, which people only buy because they're commercially told to.  Fourth, I enjoyed the Godiva Cheesecake,  very good!  Our bill came up to $70.00, not bad at all for a table of 4. I really wish the server would have communicated with us a bit more. I hope she didnt think we weren't going to tip because we were Latinos or maybe because we were Latinos, idk.

Mike L.,"Riva, United States",56,40,5,4.0,5/3/2014,"You could go to The Cheesecake Factory during a blizzard with an imminent nuclear missile launch and there'd still be a wait for a table! That's not a complaint, just an observation -- which, means that people like the place. It's funny. I spend what seems like a half hour going through the menu everytime I go, but I always seem to settle for one of few of the same items time and time again. I really like the Thai Lettuce Wraps -- I've been tempted to order like three plates of them and just make that my dinner. Their burgers are very good -- second best in the area in my expert opinion. Many other menu items I've tried have spanned the spectrum between good and great. It's hard to go wrong. OK, the biggest star on the menu is the first thing you select, but the last thing you eat -- DESSERT! Pack an extra vile of insulin or whatever you need to do and just have DESSERT! My biggest complaint is that I can't get AT&T cellphone service in the blasted place! I can't post a picture of my stacked burger or seven thousand calorie tower of cheesecake until I get in the car! But, if that's my only complaint, they're doing pretty well!

Brian P.,"Savannah, United States",3,13,3,2.0,26/7/2014,"Honestly, when factoring in the price and often long wait, this place is really not worth it.

Sarah M.,"Fort Meade, United States",64,102,14,5.0,18/5/2013,"I guess I can't write a new review...so this one is going to have to cover 2 visits. My friend has a strange allergy- canola oil- which is found in many things. Many of which you might not expect! The first visit, we communicated this to our server, who was very helpful and immediately asked one of the main chefs to come out personally. He came out right away and was very friendly- my friend let him know which dinner options she was most interested in, and he spent a few minutes discussing how he could make these without canola oil for her, and how he would personally make the dish himself and cook it separately to make it canola-free! We ordered and our food was out in less than 10 minutes- the chef who made it came out to check on her just a few minutes after we had started eating. He was animated and friendly, and so wanted her to enjoy her dinner without having to worry! It was a great success and she was able to enjoy her artichokes without any issues. My sliders were AAAHHHHMazing!! They were seriously fantastic and I was so happy to have ordered them- maybe because he made them too, so they were as hot, fresh, and delicious as could be? In any case, they were awesome! The second visit, I came back with the same friend. We asked for that chef again, but he wasn't working, so the server offered to ask another chef. I can't remember his name, but he was a very tall black man, who came up to us smiling and very charming. Again, he listened to her concerns, but not knowing exactly how his colleague had prepared her artichokes last time, he offered a few different options that all sounded good. He had a lot of ideas! We told him that we love Food Network and that he was welcome to experiment if he wanted to and ""go all Food Network on us,"" because we were sure she'd love whatever he brought out.  He seemed so excited to have the freedom to make what he wanted! Her artichokes again, were super delicious. He came out a few minutes later, hesitant and hoping that she'd loved them. When she told him how delicious they were, he was beaming! Apparently, he hasn't been able to have that much fun in the kitchen (at work) since culinary school! It was a great experience, both times, and I'm convinced that of all the CCFs in the area, this is the one that sets the standard. I've only had one negative experience here and I spoke with the manager when it happened, The rest of the time, we have really been well taken care of, and we will definitely return! The only suggestion I have is that they somehow put in a microcell or something, because there is nearly no cell signal inside the restaurant. Which is fine... unless you're using the mall's free childcare option to enjoy a bite to eat sans children. They couldn't get ahold of my friend, because we were dining inside CCF and the line wouldn't go through when her child was crying and they needed her to come pick him up.

Heather G.,"Annapolis, United States",9,18,,4.0,28/1/2013,"I'll get the negative out of the way first: if you're not at a booth, then you're packed like sardines into narrow, crowded tables, practically knocking elbows with your neighbors. You can end up waiting a while for a table unless you go well out of the normal rush hours, and there aren't a lot of places to wait. As is to be expected from the packed tables and the wait, this is a rather noisy restaurant. Also, this is definitely not a cheap place to eat. That said, I do love going here once in a while as a treat. Whether you're in T-shirt and jeans or a dress/suit, you won't feel out of place. The decor is kinda fun, and the waitstaff are friendly and attentive. The menu has an extremely wide variety of drinks, eats, and desserts, so no matter what your tastes you're likely to find something here. The avocado eggrolls are a fave, along with the sweet corn tamale cakes. There's pizza, pasta, burgers, salads, sandwiches, and just about everything in between. My favorite part of the menu, however, is the ""small plates."" If you like variety, get a bunch of these to share around the table. From mini crab cake bites, to stuffed mushrooms, to some delicious salads and crunchy fried things, there's a wonderful array of delicious little foods. Also, if you have a small appetite (most of their portions are huge!) then this is a nice way to not overstuff yourself. As nice as the cheesecakes are, I rarely get one for dessert here. They make fantastic milkshakes with a touch of liqueur in them that are just wonderful, in all sorts of flavors (the flying gorilla is one of my faves, if I'm remembering the name right). They also have some very nice fruit smoothies. If you come here for cheesecake, though, they have an amazing variety of delicious flavors. Whenever I do get cheesecake, I always end up having to get it to go. Everything is just so filling here!

We visited on Father's Day (my folks' choice).  Our food was just okay...  The Man had lunch portion of fish and chips (the fish was too fishy and greasy).  He reported that the accompanying cole slaw was crisp but not flavorful.  I opted for the lunch-sized miso salmon.  It was decent, if not a little bland.   Yes, the menu is extensive, but bigger is not better here.  There's just a lot of food from which to choose, and I haven't had anything that has been a true stand out. Also, there is no dedicated kids' menu.  I don't like that at all.  I understand that the restaurant makes more moola by forcing you to buy a full-sized item for your little one (and sure, you can take the leftovers home), but still.   Two bright spots from lunch:  the iced tea was GREAT!  Sure, it's just regular, unsweetened tea, but it was strong, and clearly fresh-brewed.  We had a coupon for a free slice of cheesecake, and The Man and I shared one that was featured for the day.  It was a cross between regular cheesecake and pineapple upside-down cake (the cake part was on the top and bottom with cheesecake in the middle--yum!).   I won't seek this place out, but if my folks suggest it, I guess that we'll grudgingly trudge along.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=100

Jesus J.,"Washington, DC, United States",51,137,,4.0,19/11/2009,"Even though Cheesecake Factory is a chain, it's one of the best chains out there.  The Annapolis location has good service, friendly staff, and delicious food.  The environment is fairly large with high ceilings - nice atmosphere.  The menu is vast and provides a huge selection of different types of food ranging from Italian to Mediterranean to American.  Also, it's a great place if you're in the mood for pasta as there is a large selection of delicious pastas.  I recommend the crusted chicken romano.  Try the strawberry lemonade as well.  It's expensive (at about $5), but it's the best strawberry lemonade I've had and includes free refills. When it comes to dessert, Cheesecake Factory is the apex of this category.  There are many, many different cheesecake flavors with varying ""heaviness"" (i.e. some cheesecakes are light and fluffy and some are heavy and topped with fudge and peanut butter).  There are other types of desserts if you're not a cheesecake kind of person.  The restaurant also brews great coffee.

Mocha Mama M.,"Bowie, United States",0,1,,1.0,13/8/2014,"I am writing to make known the horrifying experience I had yesterday afternoon at The Cheesecake Factory. My family of six ventured to Cheesecake to celebrate my daughter's birthday, but our experience and her day was ruined by the disrespectful way our waitress treated our party, especially me. First, we sat longer than usual before we received our complementary bread. Our waitress came to the table to take our drink order and again for our food orders, and never mentioned bringing bread and took her time deciding to bring some (After my later experiences with her, I guess she wanted to make sure Black folks were actually going to order something before they were approved for the free stuff . . . anyway.). I made known when the waitress took our order what items were to come as appetizers and which should come with the entrees because there were a couple of items from the appetizer list that would serve as entrees. After waiting about 20 minutes for the salad and crispy fried cheese, I stopped our waitress and said I wanted to check in on the appetizers. She curtly responded, ""Well, they have to cook it"" (As if I don't know that food has to be cooked). I was taken aback by her shortness, especially since it was only a small side salad and cheese sticks, which I've never known to take a long time to make.  She shows up five minutes later with cold cheese sticks (which means they had been ready a long time ago), the side salad, and the entrees. As she was passing out food I reminded her that I had just asked her about the appetizers, which she had implied weren't ready, and now she was bringing them with the entrees, defeating the purpose of an appetizer, which should precede the main course. As I was trying to explain myself and why I inquired about the appetizers and why I thought her previous remark was out of place, she interrupted me several times, got loud, and ordered the waiters helping her deliver the meals back to the kitchen, leaving my entire family, including my three hungry children and elderly parents (one disabled), with no food. At this point, my daughter is upset about what's going on, and our waitress and food have disappeared without an explanation. The manager appears 10 minutes later, and I briefly explain to him my issue. He never asks my name; he never apologizes. He asked if I had the food I was supposed to have and if everything was okay, now. I informed him that things were not okay, that we didn't have our food, and that our appetizers arrived cold--after waiting a lengthy time for them. I also informed him that my family dined at the restaurant at least 3 times a month and that the waitress that he reassigned us could attest to my frequency, which she did. He also said that he'd recognized me. However, I informed him that he would not be seeing my family's faces anymore, and that everyone I knew, on every social media account that I have would be informed about my experience. He said that we'd get a new waitress, which we did. However, the previous waitress made it a point to stop at the aisle in front of me several times, make eye contact, and smirk at me. As I began to observe her interactions with her White customers, I realized that she had pleasantries and patience, but she seemed to think African Americans were beneath her. I witnessed her yell at and berate an African American busboy in front of others, as well. I am completely disgusted with my experience at Cheesecake.  I am so appalled by this experience and the manager who seemed to condone it by his lack of apology, his lack of showing any visual concern about my having to endure such treatment from a staff member, and his failure to address his employee and her actions. I certainly would have expected an apology for how I was treated, but he obviously condoned her treated of non-White patrons. Business went on as usual, and at the end the day, we still received our bill, without so much as a happy birthday to my daughter who had to witness such nonsense. It is unfortunate that in 2014 my African American family cannot go into a restaurant and expect to be treated in a dignified, respectful manner.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=140

I was starving and I happen to come across CF by accident.  I have always had an affinity for their salads and so again, I delved in and had their appetizer salad ...

Ashley D.,"Severna Park, United States",5,2,,2.0,13/12/2011,"This place has always had fabulous service and that was the only thing that saved my most recent meal here. The Garlic Noodles entree was horrible.  The waitress informed me that it normally comes with bone-in chicken (huge bonus points for her) unfortunately I did not take the hint that this is probably not the best item on the menu.  First of all, I'm surprised that the description in the menu does not inform you that it includes bone-in chicken, which I feel is an important distinction. I took her up on her offer to switch it to boneless chicken offer which worked very well but it was the vegetables that were included with the dish and the overall mediocrity of it that appalled me.  I was expecting zucchini and tomatoes and fresh asparagus but instead received decent tomatoes, some rubbery eggplant, and asparagus that were as tough as tree limbs.  I now feel that I can no longer order pasta dishes with vegetables from here and expect to get high quality, fresh vegetables.  This was extremely disappointing because up until this point I thought much higher of Cheesecake Factory food.   Their saving graces are their amazing cheesecake, good service and fabulously convenient location next to the Annapolis Mall.  Its too bad Cheesecake Factory can't focus on doing several entrees well like most restaurants instead of five million where the only indicators of bombs is things like ""our most popular pasta/chicken dish"".  I think the novelty of their long menus has kinda worn off. I guess I should have known better than to think that their famously long menu actually contains dishes of equal quality. I have really enjoyed all dishes I've gotten from here previously and am very disappointed with my most recent experience.

John D.,"Williamsburg, United States",3,69,3,1.0,19/5/2009,"Wow.  Where to begin?  Well,  we decided to eat here on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday.  We got there at 5pm to avoid the crowds and the wait was only 20 mins.  To be fair, our hostess that seated us was lovely and thanked us for being patient.  But it was all downhill from there. Our waitress came promptly for our drink orders.  The women ordered drinks off of the drink menu, but when the guys attempted to order drinks and specify brand names - the waitress's jaw dropped and she started stumbling, attempting to write down what we were telling her on her note pad.  I don't think a ""dirty Bombay martini"" is too complicated.  Interesting side note is that the restaurant's martini menu only has vodka martinis and not a single gin martini, which is really the true alcohol of martinis.  Anyhow, about 15 mins later, I inquired about our drinks and she assured me that they were coming soon.  Well, after a total of about 20 mins we got our drinks.  The dirty martini was supposed to come with bleu cheese olives, but it didn't, and my friend's drink was not mixed well either.  I sent mine back and asked for something simpler, like a gin and tonic.  To the restaurant's credit, a seasoned bar tender came over, sat down at our table and apologized for the inexperienced wait staff and asked what I really wanted.  I had guessed that our waitress was on her first or second night.  Turns out she did admit it was her second night.  So we ordered one appetizer to share - - and it took about 30 minutes to come out.  While we were eating it, I predicted that our dinners would be out any second now.  Sure enough, entrees came out 3 minutes after our appetizer.  Meanwhile, one of the ladies ordered another drink -- which took about 10 mins to get.  The waitress came back and said something about how she didn't realize that you ordered drinks on the right side of the bar, but were supposed to pick them up on the left side!!  I ordered another drink a few minutes later - - after about 10 mins I asked about it - - she said the order for the drink slipped down between the glasses at the bar and apologized for about the tenth time.   Entrees - overall the food was fairly good, though the french fries were room temperature and my brocoli was actually a bit cold.  The manager heard we were not happy and came over and took the appetizers off of our bill - - nice gesture, but one appetizer, big deal. We were as patient as could be.. but I can tolerate one or two screw ups... but this meal was one screw up after another.  The waitress was actually crying, and we were not being rude to her.  She was a nice young girl, but it was out of control.   Bottom line - - I mostly blame the restaurant's management for letting a new waitress wait on tables on her second night, on a Saturday, with what appears to be very little training.  The food timing was terrible - maybe she put the orders in late, who knows.  Wait staff should be trained on some basic bar stuff - - rocks, up, brand names, etc.  I've had some good experiences at other Cheesecake Factories around the country, but this one will never see me again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=140

The portions are enormous so be prepared to bring some home for lunch the next day.  They also give you complimentary bread (two different kinds) which is always nice.  I was so full that I could not enjoy the fifty kinds of cheesecakes they have to offer.

Everyone else also seemed to enjoy their food, although no one was jumping up and down over anything.  I would probably rate this only three stars, but the eggrolls were yummy enough to make me want to go back again and again.

Veronica L.,"Annapolis, United States",79,13,,5.0,10/11/2010,"My boyfriend was in the mood for cheesecake, so off we were to the Cheesecake Factory.  We were greeted right and sat down right away.  The place was pretty packed for 9pm on a Wednesday night.  We had only gone in for desert but as soon as I walked in, I felt like I wanted actual food as well.  My boyfriend didn't want any so sharing an appetizer was out, but in their menu, they have a whole page of small plates and snacks, priced between $4-7.  I ordered crispy artichoke hearts and spicy chicken samosas, plus a caramel macchiato (I actually wanted a lemonade but it was $4!  Too much in my opinion)   Both small dishes came with sauces and were actually decent in portion for what it was.  I also ended up getting a coconut chocolate cheesecake and my boyfriend got a regular chocolate cheesecake.  Everything was really good and actually I didn't finish anything I ordered, so I got it all wrapped up (they do it in the back for you).  Our server was Matthew and I thought he was friendly and quick.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=160
J M.,"Chesapeake Beach, United States",0,9,,4.0,2/6/2010,"A family favorite with consistently good food and service. Occasionally, the complimentary bread will have that day-old taste but the staff will replace it immediately. Tex-Mex eggrolls are a good starter, the raw fish apps are quite good, and the bar is competent with a adequate wine selection. Extensive entree menu can be overwhelming but we enjoy the 4-cheese ravioli, the Cobb salad, fish tacos, the smokehouse burger, and the herb crusted salmon. Dessert is, well, cheesecake (we've never tried anything else). The traditional with strawberries is quite good but the red velvet is our current go-to finisher.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis?start=160
Kimberly J.,"Baltimore, United States",122,222,296,4.0,27/11/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory location at least twice before this visit and it has been pretty good. The food is good and the service is excellent. However, this most recent visit, my food was not the best. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, one of my favorite pasta dishes from here. The peppers and mushrooms were burnt. I probably should have sent it back but I was starving and didn't feel like waiting for them to remake it. I just removed the burnt parts and ate the pasta. My boyfriend ordered the Factory Burrito Grande and that was as great as always.  Our server was great. He was very attentive and friendly. When we left, my boyfriend left his hat and the server ran behind us to make sure we got the hat. I honestly think it was just a busy day and the kitchen  just made a mistake. This is still one of my favorite locations.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis
Cam C.,"Washington, DC, United States",68,74,275,2.0,12/11/2017,"My family and I come here all the time. The service at this location is inconsistent. Our most recent visit was the worst experience yet. Our waitress had a horrible attitude and looked annoyed the entire time! She barely communicated with us. Her poor attitude and lack of communication caused multiple issues: We asked for certain items to be separated on our bill, and before we could tell her which items should be charged to which debit cards, she takes our debit cards and abruptly walks away. And as one would expect, she charged the wrong items to the wrong cards. When you have an attitude like our waitress did, I guess you don't care about your customers' finances.  With my brunch combo, I asked for fried eggs cooked hard. They brought out scrambled eggs instead. Not a big deal. I do like scrambled eggs, but it's not what I asked for. By the time they brought out the correct eggs, I was basically done with the rest of my food. I'm not sure if our waitress or the cook is at fault for this, but regardless it was an inconvenience.  After we finished eating, I asked for a burger to-go. At the time I didn't even think to mention that I wanted it well done, because usually a GOOD waiter/waitress will ask how you want your burger cooked. It wasn't until I got home that I realized my burger had pink in it. This lets you know that the waitress decided on behalf of me, instead of being honest and going back to me to see how I wanted it cooked.  This was the first time we've had this particular waitress, and I certainly hope it is the last. On a positive note, all of our food was delicious as always. Also, the wait for a table was pretty short (about 10 minutes) for a Sunday afternoon.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis
Iris D.,"Annapolis, United States",2,24,39,1.0,30/9/2017,"Positive: The variety of cheesecake and the extensive menu of food. My favorite to order is the salmon option -- grilled with 2 sides of vegetables or the miso salmon with rice. Both choices are great; however, I've experienced a few times where the salmon doesn't taste fresh. I contacted the manager and they were able to assist in changing my order. I've tried other choices such as the fish tacos, variety of pastas, salads, etc. on the menu and not one stood out beyond ordinary. Negative: Long wait up to 45 minutes especially dinner time on the weekends; they don't offer reservations so it's on a first come, first serve basis. Also, finding parking can be a pain. The service is also a hit or miss and so is the quality of the food. The most unfortunate is the  cheesecake size; it has gotten smaller in size over the years (30%-40% reduction in size, but yet prices keeps increasing). So disappointing. But the worse is the....Eek! We saw a baby ROACH on the floor. It went inside a hole on the wall before I was able to kill it. There's a possible cockroach infestation behind those walls. Yuck. Filth. Rating went down from a 2 to a big fat 0 because of this. It maybe a long time before I return. Gross.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis

Aubrey F.,"Baltimore, United States",29,188,220,5.0,24/8/2017,"Love this place! So many options to choose from between drinks, appetizers, entrees, and cheesecakes.  I got the Grilled Artisan Bread with Creamy Melted Cheese, Truffle Oil and Bacon as an appetizer. Definitely enough to share. I ended up having leftovers and it heated up really well in the oven on 400 degrees for about 7 minutes. Very flavorful!  I ordered the Mac and Cheese Burger. It's a burger that has the cheese and cheesy friend macaroni and cheese ball on top. I asked for my burger cooked medium and they did a great job with cooking it that way. It also came lettuce, onion, and mayo. The fries were really good too! I asked for a side of their ranch, which was amazing!  Unfortunately, I did not leave room for cheesecake but I'm not sure you can go wrong with any of their cheesecakes!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis

Monica M.,"Annapolis, United States",0,1,,1.0,13/1/2018,"The wait was extremely long. I understand I am a teenager with my friends, but we are still paying customers. And then on top of that, the hostess was unwelcomingly rude and it was not okay. I did not appreciate her tone. All I asked was how much longer until my table would be seated, and instead of being kind, the hostess replied by saying we had only waited partial of our presumed wait, not all of it yet. I don't understand why she had to be so rude when I nicely asked what our wait time was. Not to mention we had already been waiting an hour. My party asked again, and they continued to extend our time past what the originally stated. l will not be bringing my service back, and I am not happy with the service anyway.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis

Ronnie T.,"Hyattsville, United States",51,73,50,4.0,19/12/2016,"Let's just say that Sunday Brunch was double delicious. Before Christmas shopping, Cheesecake Factory was decided on as the place to fuel us up before shopping. Me and my Family were seated quickly and promptly. Our waitress was a fireball! Very friendly, quick and efficient. I ordered the Hibiscus lemonade as my beverage, which was highly recommended by our waitress& it was phenomenal! It had a very fresh and flavorful floral taste, in addition to earthy hints!  The food took a while to come out, but it was well worth the wait. As my main dish I ordered the Baja Tacos and man oh man, lets just say that they didn't last for more than 5 minutes! Five chicken filled tacos with a side of cilantro rice and I substituted the beans for tortilla chips. These tacos had a very beachy kind of a feel to them, with a delicious mesh of freshness and mouthwatering smoky grilled flavor. My dining experience was well beyond superb! And I highly recommend this cheesecake factory location!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis
Cameron B.,"Upper Marlboro, United States",328,74,53,3.0,4/6/2017,"I ventured to the Cheesecake Factory on a Thursday evening around 8pm with my parents.   We were seating right away by the friendly hostesses in a booth per our request.  We were greeted by our waitress shortly after being seated and served bread, butter, and a round of waters to start.  The service across the course of the evening was great -- at one point we asked for more white rice to go with our jambalaya dish.  Sides of rice were brought out to us with no additional charge! The menu is a bit overwhelming...there are just sooooo many choices it's almost hard what to choose.  My dad recommended the jambalya, so I went for it.  I'm happy I did!  It was filled with chicken, sausage, rice, and veggies.  To beef it up a bit, I added some white rice to it.  It was enough food to last two dinners. This seems to be a restaurant where you won't be blown away by the quality but you'll certainly be glad you came! They are most famous for their wide array of cheesecake offerings.  Ironically enough, I'm not a fan of cheesecake so I opted out of dessert but my parents really enjoyed their cheesecake choices.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis
Allyson R.,"Mitchellville, United States",0,6,1,1.0,9/12/2017,"I typically love coming to this restaurant because the food is phenomenal. The menu is extensive and there's just so much to choose from. I've patronized The Cheesecake Factory enough that I have my favorites and I typically stick to them. One of those favorites is the Avocado Eggrolls and I ordered this menu item today. But I ran into a bit of an issue while enjoying this appetizer. I bit into something that I initially thought was the rice noodle garnish, but I decided to take it out of my mouth because it felt slightly harder and scraped the roof of my mouth the wrong way. It turns out, it was a metal wire of some sort. Not just a twist tie, this was some serious gauge metal that could've caused considerable damage to my intestinal tract. I'm betting it's from their frying baskets that they cook fried food in. Regardless of where it came from, I hope that this location improves its safety procedures to avoid such incidents. I'm an avid patron of The Cheesecake Factory, but issues such as this are absolutely terrifying and could've resulted in more dire consequences.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-annapolis
Sherita C.,"Greater Landover, United States",112,71,214,3.0,3/3/2017,"I have always been a fan of Cheesecake factory. I love how they have an endless variety of cheesecake as well as a healthier menu options. I visited this location on a Thursday night and it wasn't crowded at all. My boyfriend and walked in and was seated right away. I love the decor and how intimate the restaurant is. Our waiter was ""Katie"" she was in training and let us know that as soon as we were seated. She was really nice and made a point to highlight the special of the day as well as popular items on the menu. I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta and he ordered the Jambalaya Chicken and Shrimp pasta. I wasn't impressed with my pasta, but his was good just lacking a little salt. I normally order the salmon but I was trying to be a little adventurous and venture out. My pasta wasn't bad, but it wasn't to die for. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake, my norm. It was amazing!!!! I was so full from the pasta and complementary bread that I didn't even finish all of my cheesecake. I was going to pass on  the cheesecake but you can not go the cheesecake factory and not order cheesecake. My boyfriend doesn't like cheesecake at all so he skipped desert, his loss, lol!!!

I went back to my seat for this to continue and no one bothered to even come over and ask them to keep it down.

The cheesecakes are the stars, of course, but I honestly have been here pretty frequently without partaking, so don't feel like you haaaaave to be naughty when you go here.

© H.,"Washington, DC, United States",174,59,60,1.0,20/12/2016,"The service has gone down significantly here as of late & I've noticed this on several occasions (as have others dining in close proximity.) twice now I've waited well over 15-30 min to simply have my order taken and another 40 - 1 hr, for the food to come out- not once but 3 times now. Totally unacceptable. I've brought  this to the attention of the hostess as well as management and have heard everything from shift changes to kitchen and computer being down offered as an excuse several  times in a 3 month period. (Shifts change, how bout one puts in the order - the other coming on should  finish! Fix the system!!)  Additionally, I've noticed 2 party's who have been seated well after me have gotten there food before me on various occasions. This time, once the food finally came, it was off and the plate missing a side that is usually there. The concession offered was insulting at best, and I'm a regular, the times this has happened before nothing. Certainly not looking for a hand out but rather my food, as ordered, in a timely fashion -without excuse- and not have to wander about looking for resolve or to call the waitress back asking why the Jamaican shrimp has 0 shrimp but instead chicken?! After all the wait, It as passed off like I wouldn't notice- again insulting, communicate if something is out so I can make other choice at my discretion, not yours!!!

It was ONLY when she handed us our checks (before we were about to pay and tip her) that she became personal and sweet...  The food was absolutely delicious.
