Ronnie D.,"Pasadena, CA",0,14,,5.0,4/11/2016,Once in a while you get bad service but overall i love this location.  Food can also depend on which chef is working as ive had the same dish with different experiences.  They have a sunday brunch dish with pancakes and they were really good.  Highly recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=480
Grand C.,"Pasadena, CA",462,245,380,4.0,1/8/2014,"Yay!!! I'm a fan!  More than a fan, you have 100+ things on the menu.  Sometimes I sit there, flipping pages even though I know what they have. Trying to figure what I want to eat, how much I want to spend, do i want to eat healthy or go all out, review the skinnylicious menu, then after dinner weather or not i should have cheesecake or other desserts.   tonight i went with my family.  My dad had a Miso Salmon, my mom had the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and I had the Barbecue Salmon with Corn Succotash and broccoli. I loved the dish i got, the fish was cooked medium. I wish it was a little under, medium rare.  The fish marinade with bbq sauce on top was really delicious.  I was quite happy I ordered this.  My mom made me one of her lettuce wraps, and that was really good too.  These lettuce wraps are messy but really delicious, I might order that next time!   What's not to like about this restaurant. You have a million options, the food is good if not great, of course depends on what dish you order, the appetizers are delicious, and the desserts/cheesecake are really good.   Few favorite dishes/desserts are: Chicken Bellagio, Miso Salmon, BBQ Salmon, Avocado Rolls, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, Santa Fe Salad, BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, and Cajun Jambalaya!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=480
Talia R.,"South Pasadena, CA",87,85,9,5.0,1/6/2014,"Went to Cheesecake last night before a movie. It was extremely crowded but we got lucky and found 4 seats at the bar. Our food took about 30 min, which is not a big deal except we were late for the movie. We ended up having to get to-go boxes as soon as the food came. The manager was extremely apologetic even though it was completely unnecessary and offered us complementary cheesecake to go. We did not think we would be able to take in anymore food into the theater so we declined the offer. They offered us to come back and pick up our cake after the movie (even though they closed an hour before the movie got out). We were so pleased and impressed with the generosity of the manager and all the staff.  I don't normally give so much detail when I Yelp, but this is probably one of the top customer service gestures I've ever received and I wanted to share!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=480
Mitch W.,"Monterey Park, CA",960,856,7746,4.0,5/5/2009,"When I like something, I tend to go back over and over.  Cheesecake Factory has been one of those standby, good restaurants.  It can be fairly healthy depending on what you order.   My latest discovery at Cheesecake Factory is the Turkey Burger!  I tried it for the first time the last time I ate at CF.  It was very good, so I had it again this visit.  It comes with french fries.  $10.95. Service is normally excellent at Cheesecake Factory and this time was no exception.  Like I mentioned in a previous review, I like their sourdough with butter.  Yummy! I like this location better than the one in Pasadena because the wait is normally shorter.  Our wait was about 10 minutes on a Saturday evening around 8pm.

Calla L.,"Monrovia, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/1/2014,"I have a number of favorite dishes at Cheesecake Factory and was excited to use curbside pickup because it's always impossibly crowded at this location. The first time was fine. The second time was a nightmare. It took nearly 80 minutes to bring our order out, this after we called twice to see what was holding it up. When they finally bring it out, there is no apology or bread. They grudgingly returned with our credit card and 2 pieces of bread for a $75 order. My husband said it best: never again. An apology would have gone a long way with me, but I guess they were too busy to bother. As a final insult, our food was cold and had to be reheated. Clearly, it had been sitting around all along. Great job choosing my birthday to be annoying, CF. Lame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=480
Kristin T.,"San Gabriel, CA",379,295,374,4.0,8/24/2013,"My problem is I don't like change and always want to stick with what I know will taste good but seems like whatever I order here is always really good! Sometimes restaurants with huge menus can have mediocre food because there's just so much to choose from, but the Cheesecake Factory does a good job making sure all their food is top notch. I'm not much of a cheesecake fan, but here at Cheesecake Factory is pretty much the only place I eat cheesecake at. I don't like how they can get too rich and thick and overwhelming tasting but here their cheesecakes are delicious! I just stick with a simple strawberry cheesecake, plain cheesecake with some strawberries and syrup. Yum. Tip, DO NOT SIT OUTSIDE. At least around nighttime. There are SOO many flies out there it's disgusting. I understand it's near the racetrack so maybe that's why. But honestly, there were about 50+ flies just sitting on the bar window. On the ground about 20+ just sitting there till someone walks by and they fly everywhere. I could care less about flies but when they start flying into your face and on your food, that bothers me. Cheesecake Factory should really invest in those scented bug off candles or some sort of repellant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=480
Eddie M.,"Pico Rivera, CA",1,7,,1.0,6/7/2015,"When arriving to the restaurant our waiter seemed to be under the influence. He was very attentive and had slurred speach. Made it very difficult to understand him. Kept coming to our table every two minutes. My drink tasted weird so when inspecting the glass a piece of the rim was broken off leaving behind a sharp edge. If it wasn't for the straw I would of probably cut myself. The waiter apologized but seemed to shrug it off and change the subject. To top it off my meal was cold and it tasted awful. The waiter noticed i barely ate any and placed it in a container for me which I threw away in the entrances trash can. Horrible location to visit. Don't come here. Management must be horrible to have such poor standards from staff, food and service. Waste of money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=480

I put the fork down and poked at it. Low and behold a disgusting snail in my kale salad. Wtf!!!! I could not believe my eyes. I threw out the salad in my mouth and called for the waiter. Long story short the manager tried to make up for this disgusting incident by giving me a damn cheesecake. Hell no.

Anthony L.,"Pasadena, CA",101,271,29,3.0,1/21/2015,"Food is generally consistently good. It's a chain restaurant, so you should expect everything to be consistent. The cheesecake is always good, but it has to get thawed everyday before they serve it. That means their cheesecake is made in some sort of factory somewhere and then gets frozen before it's shipped to the restaurant. It makes me wonder though. If the plate comes to you hot, is the food microwaved?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=480
Dietrich S.,"Orange, CA",124,263,44,1.0,12/11/2012,"Oh, why the hell did I come here? I hate the Cheescake Factory. I have been to multiple locations and I've always hated it, for various reasons at different times. Sloppy service, shite food, high prices, lame atmosphere. You pick, this place can dish up any or all on any given night.  I was with my beautiful and wonderful girlfriend, and we were near this particular Cheesecake Factory, and I said lets go for it. She (smartly) told me ""No, you know you hate that place."" I insisted. ""Maybe it will be ok"" I thought to myself. Hey, the world just seems like a brighter and better place with her around. And Cheesecake sounded good anyway. I had never actually tried the cheesecake here. It seemed like a good night to do it.  I felt like Macaroni and Cheese, and so did the GF. They don't seem to have that here (the one thing that they DON'T actually have on their godforsaken menu), so I ordered the Five Cheese Pasta (with chicken) and she ordered the Macaroni and Cheeseburger, and we split them. The five cheese pasta was a flavorless mess, and the extra money for the chicken was not worth it. Once again, no surprise, another culinary failure from the Cheesecake Factory.  The Macaroni and Cheeseburger is slightly better, but only just. The beef patty for the burger itself had a strange and none-too-pleasing flavor, but the fried Mac-N-Cheese patty was good. Hey, I guess even Cheesecake Factory can't screw that up. Of course, those patties probably come to them frozen. Not hard to just dip them in a deep frier.  So hey, dinner was a bit of a waste (well, a huge waste), but what about desert? The waiter brings the desert menu around and shows off thier featured cheesecake, a yummy looking oreo cookie concoction. I peruse the menu looking at the various cheescake selections, of wich there are quite a few. Then I notice the price, $6.95 - $7.95 per slice. What? Seriously? I asked the waiter if that was for like 1/4 of a cheesecake, and he said no, but that they are decent slices. I felt like telling him to go eff himself, but it wasn't his fault, he doesn't set the prices, and he was a nice guy who gave us good service, really the only upside to the night. As it was, the bill was $31.43 after tax but before tip, with no drinks, no appetizers, and no fucking overpriced Cheesecake. Just two lame-assed dinner entrees.   So, seriously Cheesecake Factory, fuck you. I'm not kidding. I don't like to be vulgar or crass or rude in my yelp reviews, but I have to do it this time. You guys suck ass, and furthermore, anyone who really likes this place doesn't know a good meal from a hole in the ground. Again, I don't like to get all snobby about my foody-ness, but I'm going to this time. After being thoroughly disappointed by three different Cheesecake Factory locations on four separate occasions over the last six years (that I recall) I will never darken your towers again. Your chefs should be ashamed of themselves, and the fact that you are still in business just goes to prove the old adage that nobody ever went broke by underestimating the bad taste of the American public.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=480

Angelica M.,"Alhambra, CA",14,23,207,4.0,4/24/2013,Came here for my birthday. I ordered the Steak Diane it was delicious. Our waiter was really nice and friendly he made us laugh a couple times.

Regina W.,"Los Angeles, CA",124,780,2004,4.0,4/18/2013,I've been here many times in the past but I've recently been ordering to go so I don't have to wait for a table. I went on a Saturday morning at around 1pm and ordered the fried chicken salad ($10) and a shrimp and bacon sandwich with a side salad ($14). I brought it home to share with everyone and everything was delicious! The chicken salad was my favorite because it came with a decadent buttermilk dressing. The person who took my order was also super friendly and kept telling me how much I'd love the fried chicken salad. He was right! I'll get it the next time I go. The order took about 20 minutes to make so I just went next door to paris baguette while they were preparing it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=480

I love almost every savory dish that comes out. I'm not too big on sweets so the cheesecakes aren't really for me, but a little nibble here and there is enough--great for sharing. (I mean everything is--they have great portions for their foods.) + Atmosphere: really nice! Clean, large seating spaces, beautiful decor. This is a good place for a large group of family/friends, a small group of coworkers, or even a date. + Service: The servers and hosts/hostesses are generally very nice and helpful. (I only wish they could leave the Parmesan cheese block and grater on our table--it's against their policy...and I love my cheese!)      + Customer service: If a problem ever arose, they were always on it! + Price: not bad for a place and food like this! + Parking: private parking lot available (shared with the mall). There's also a valet service in front of the Cheesecake Factory and a parking structure behind it. BAD: - Food (to-go): Generally there aren't any problems, but I suggest you check your to-go orders before you leave the premises. Just in case. That's just a good habit for any place you go to.

Dorothy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",849,422,753,4.0,11/21/2010,"Despite this being a chain restaurant (with a usually ridiculous wait), their food never ceases to be delicious. I had the Wild Mushroom Glamburger. (Is that like a burger inspired by Adam Lambert?) I know they have a gazillion things on the menu, but I just can't get away from their burgers! There are so many that sound amazing, and the mushroom burger was one I tried that definitely lived up to the enticing description. It has lots of sautéed mushrooms and onions, and is covered in melted Swiss and Fontina cheese. It was so good! ...I upgraded to the sweet potato fries for a dollar - they were not the best I've had, so I didn't finish them (a rare occasion for me - I'm the SPF Queen!). My BF loves the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta entrée. (He convinced three people in our group to order it, as well!) I have to admit, I tried some of his dish, and it wasn't as flavorful as other times we've had it, but it was still good. The chef really loads it up with chicken and shrimp. We also shared a house Salad, which had a really good dressing and was really fresh. They don't skimp on the greens, either! Other orders in our group were the enormous Sunrise Fiesta Burrito (two friends shared this and the jambalaya and both were devoured), Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes (she said it was okay), and a Mushroom Pizza with a ranch side salad (no verdict). For dessert, we shared two cheesecakes - the seasonal Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake, and the classic Tiramisu Cheesecake. The Pumpkin Pecan was good... but didn't taste like cheesecake. (I could just get a Costco pumpkin pie, add some pecans, and be just as happy!) The Tiramisu Cheesecake is absolutely delectable. It's the perfect combination of the two dessert flavors. I have before, and would again get, a whole Tiramisu Cheesecake. :) Everyone knows the wait at this CF is lengthy, and the restaurant is packed (bar area included). The wait at 6:30 on a Friday night for a party of eight was one hour (they don't take reservations at that time). It was fine with me though, because the beeper signal reaches all the way over to the tons of bar space at Bar Louie!

And very filling and satisfying.  I order the shrimp scampi and it was more flavors than I expected it was delicious and steaming hot.  I love It when they serve it when it is just made instead of it siting for a while.

Connie C.,"Orange County, CA",633,392,1135,1.0,11/29/2012,"Eleven months ago...the food and the service was excellent. What happened? Management.  First, we were greeted very quickly. We were seated as well and given menus. Then, I wanted to go to the restroom to wash my hands and omg...horrid...the most unsanitary restroom. The stalls...disgusting. I went to the front desk to tell them to clean the restroom and I stood there for a good three minutes. The hostess was too busy communicating with her co-workers that they even noticed and did not say anything. Strike one. Second, I went back to the table and glanced through the menu...took awhile since the menu was soooo long. Then, our waitress decided to come to our table...twenty minutes later. Strike two.  Third, we ordered 3 items...Factory chopped salad, chicken carbonara with meat sauce (lactose, so I didn't have the garlic green pea cream sauce), and miso salmon. The factory chopped salad had onions, mozzarella (supposed to be blue cheese, but I changed it), avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, corn, and chicken. This was refreshing; however, the onions definitely threw off the flavor as well as the vinaigrette (very tangy). The chicken carbonara has bacon (made perfectly), spaghetti, basil, and meat sauce. This didn't taste that great because the olive oil was too overwhelming taking away the flavor of the dish. The meat sauce was salty and wasn't cooked to my liking (stick with Buca or Olive Garden). Lastly, the miso salmon is made with your choice of white or brown rice (brown of course), and had snap peas for decorations. The dish was beautifully displayed. The salmon was cooked to perfection, just melted in my mouth. The snap peas...disappointed because they forgot to peel the top portion which should have been pulled off. The sauce was pretty good though. So one out of three? Kind of a miss for me. The unlimited bread that was given was hard as a rock as well as the butter. So really...I guess this makes it Strike three? Overall, eleven months ago...what was I thinking giving five stars? That must have been a facade...because the food and service are dwindling downwards. I would suggest Brea, The Grove or Rancho Cucamonga.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=480
Gina D.,"Highland, CA",1,2,1,1.0,1/21/2013,"So, let me start of by saying I frequent the Cheesecake Factory in Rancho Cucamonga. While not perfect, I usually have good food and service. This location however disappointed me. We were seated promptly and our waitress was friendly. I ordered a salad and my company ordered a chicken sandwich. Our food came, my salad wasn't the one I ordered, so our server suggested I see if I like the one they gave me. Mmmhh I dont like iceberg lettuce so there really wasn't a chance in hell I was going to eat this salad it was nothing like what I wanted, so she was going to get me a new one.  Fine. First problem fixed. But the real problem was the chicken sandwich we ordered... had an obvious. black. hair. on top of the bun.  just chillen there.  I told our waitress there was a hair on our food. She says, ""oh, that's gross. I'm sorry"". And continues to try to help me fix my salad. Huh?? So... She expects us to just deal with the hair? She doesn't take it away, offer to get a new one. Nothing. Wtf is this shit?  So at this point I don't care what salad they bring ME. what about that hair?! I ask to speak to a manager. He says something like, ""oh that's strange she didn't ask to get you a new one"" he offers us cheesecake and some other garbage but still handles the situation poorly. By this time we had been stating at our ineddible food long enough I was ready to go. The manager says, ""oh okay, I'll get you your check"". No you won't. Haha we didn't eat anything!

Javier J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1656,1996,248,2.0,11/13/2012,"I'm going to be upfront and say it, I don't see the appeal of coming to The Cheesecake factory.  For so long I was able to dodge any forced attempt to bring me out to this restaurant chain that is a jack of all trades but a master of none. Unless you consider mastering a dish injecting enough sodium to kill a small donkey. Because that's what the food taste like.  Also it taste like misery.  I say misery because I don't know how else describe a poor sense of taste that would result in answering ""Where do you want to go for your Birthday/Father's day/Mother's Day/Graduation/?"" than by having no answer leading you to choose the cheesecake factor for such festivities.  It shouldn't, but yet it's one of those go to places and all humanity suffers for this.  In any case, the service was slow, though given the level of demand that most folks have in this ""Babies first dining out experience"", it's hard to not have a wait staff that isn't soul crushed by poor to little to  no tipping what-so-ever.  But the menu is the real problem. I'm not sure why places like this really try to master all dishes. They always end up falling short and this is no exception. You're paying for atmosphere, that's probably it and considering you're in Santa Anita, there's a lot better options to choose from if you just expanded that closed off range.

The main reason why I don't like going to Cheesecake is the prices; it's kind on the steep side, where a basket of 5 fish and chips is like 10 bucks, but there's a HUGE helping of coleslaw. Kind of fishy, literally. My friend ordered the Santa Fe salad, lunch portion, but he said that the portion seemed WAY too big for lunch. The location of this place isn't too bad, on the outskirts of the Westfield Mall of Santa Anita, which is located right next to the race tracks. Service was great, even though after the bartender checked on us twice, my friend had to go to the bar to place the order.

Raven V.,"Arcadia, CA",42,2,,5.0,5/20/2012,"To be honest I come here to get drinks and seafood.  Each time I go, they never fail to please me. Ahi Tuna Tartare:  It's a small dish.  But totally excellent.  If you like avocado, raw Ahi Tuna, and Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce, you'll love this.  I'm not entirely sure what the cracker/chip-like item is that they give to you to eat it with, but it definitely adds excellent texture to the dish. Seared Ahi Tuna Tataki Salad:  This salad is just brilliant.  The person who made it should have a statue erected in his honor.  The mixture of leafy greens and the sauce with a bit of avocado and the thick pieces of seared Tuna together make this a perfect dish.  I won't lie, it's a bit spicy, but hey, doesn't make it any less delicious.  The salad is a bit pricey as well, but I'm not complaining. Ravenswood Zinfandel:  My taste for it is still developing in terms of identifying and being able to pair good wines with food.  However, I can sometimes pair up a pretty good wine with a pretty good dish.  For example, the Ravenswood Zinfandel actually compliments the Tuna quite nicely. Blueberry Mojito:  Mint, Blueberries, Booze.  Enough said (it's really good).  I wasn't expecting miracles or a glass of Amy Winehouse's blood (too much?) or anything, but this stuff came pretty close. In terms of the service, usually whenever I go there, the service is pretty good.  Really the trick to getting decent service in any restaurant is to sit somewhere where your server goes by frequently.  Or just be human to them and they may tend to notice you a bit more.  In some cases, I've gotten a little chatty with my server and they've apologized in advance for not swinging by frequently enough because it was so busy.  Long story short:  Don't go to a restaurant with an attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=580

Gary L.,"San Gabriel, CA",257,628,19,4.0,9/26/2009,"I came on a Friday night at about 8PM or so and it was only a 5 minute wait. Surprising! Also, I saw that one slice of their cheesecakes has over 1200+ calories! Wow! Okay, back on topic. On this visit to this particular Cheesecake Factory, I got to try the Sangria with white wine, the Pasta Da Vinci, and the Chinese Chicken Salad. I've never had Sangria with white wine before and it wasn't bad.  It wasted a little bitter but it is probably because of the fruit that is in it.  I think it tastes like grapefruit juice.  It wasn't very strong either.  I didn't really feel it in my face and I'm a lightweight!  Whether or not my face got red, that's a different story. Pasta Da Vinci.  No relation to Leonardo. (stupid joke).  The penne pasta was an okay combination with the rest of the ingredients.  I prefer long pasta, like angel hair or spaghetti, but penne works alright.  It came with cup up chicken breast and button mushrooms.  The mushrooms were probably my favorite part of the dish.  The size was adequate.  Not too much and not too little. Chinese Chicken Salad.  It tasted similar to the salad you'd find at Souplantation, at least the dressing.  The portion is pretty large and I figure if you're one person eating all of it, you'll get sick of it before you can finish all of it.  But if two people share it, it'd make a good size as an appetizer.  The dressing wasn't too sweet but if you order dressing on the side and pour it on, well, then it gets a bit sweet, but still good! The service wasn't as great as what I experienced at the Cheesecake Factory at Americana.  I think during the entire dinner, the guy only checked in on us 2 or 3 times.  But the guy was busy anyway with a lot of tables to cover.  Four stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=580

Service has always been great regardless if I come here on a date with hubby or a group setting with my girlfriends. They're really good with refilling drinks. Food is consistently good. I normally order pasta but this past wednesday, I ordered filet mignon with mashed potatoes. The only thing I have to complain about is that the middle of the mashed potatoes isn't fully mashed enough. A bit chunky but not a huge deal breaker! My husband ordered pork chop and it came with sides of mashed potatoes, spinach, and apple sauce. Interesting combo and it worked! I've tried the following cheesecakes over the yrs: Tiramisu cheesecake - Skip it! Perhaps i got it on a bad day but it wasn't even in the form of a slice of cake. It was just a glob! Didn't taste good to me at all and i'm a huuuuge fan of tiramisu Original cheesecake w/fresh strawberries- the best by far! Raspberry cheesecake w/white chocolate- the dark crust makes it too sweet Blueberry cheesecake w/white chocholate- reg crust which is better but the white chocolate inside the cheesecake makes it too sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=580

Long story short went for lunch to CF this afternoon, it took them 20 min to bring us bread and our water, another 40 min to serve us wrong order, my son asked for chicken sliders with fries no salt, they served beef patties and fries with a lot of salt, my other kid asked for grilled salmon, that fish was not grilled it was fried, sooo greasy and dry my kid couldn't eat it. So sad, I called and spoke with the manager on duty, he was so disrespectful, instead of apologizing, gave me a nasty attitude, said ""why are you calling three hours later when it was dine in order?"", well because I had to wait for an hour and my kids were late to their swimming lesson, I had to go and took everything to go.

I'm sad to say that I want to give this place 3 stars. I mean the servers were nice, we all made eye contact and they seemed genuinely friendly.  However when we ordered it was a bit of a mess. Me and one of my cousins ordered for cousin2 who was stuck in traffic.  We asked them for Shrimp and Steak.  There was a combination deal that the waiter told us about and we were like okay ""if you guys can add a side of steak to the shrimp then that'd be cool.'   He told us it was possible because he double checked with the chef. He came back and we stared at the ""steak"". Stared. It was grey and chopped up, looked more like parts of a beef stew with gray sauce rather then a steak.  My cousin who ordered it poked at it and then took a piece of it for herself.  She told me it had no taste.  The waiter was so nice so we felt like dicks for not asking what the fuck was this fuckery. When cousin2 came around, he stared at the plate and then laughed asking us 'what was this.'  We told him our little story. Then afterwards we ordered dessert.  The same waiter brought us a tiramisu cheese cake and banana cream cheese cake. Why did my tiramisu taste like regular plain coffee cake?   Not cool.

No, amazing doesn't even describe it! So good, if I was a mystery guest he would have gotten over 100% due to passing the bonus section (although I never know exactly what that is, maybe changing the bev naps on every drink delivery.. But who knows) anywho, he was reallyamiable and attentive! The bf and I never order dessert but he did such a great job at suggestive selling that the bf jumped up atthe sound of reses pieces!

Cheesecakes = yum Our order came out late, but the waitress gave us complimentary soup, so that was nice.  It's very dark inside.

Since we love calamari, that was next and it was the perfect amount to share for two. Next we ordered two factory combinations and that definitely more than we could handle.

The complimentary bread didn't come until our food came while compared to the other customers around, they got bread right away. What's up with that?

Us: ""Yes, please"" *nods*, etc. She proceeds to just hold our her hand, insinuating for us to put our dirty plates in her hand. Can she not bend over two feet and grab that plate from the table herself? Ugh. Seriously woman? Laziest waitress I have ever seen. Also, the food was heavy heavy heavy. I felt sick to my stomach after eating only half a plate of the pasta marinara - typically a light, fresh dish. My friend said it looked like something we would slap together on a dime in college - not a good sign.

Scott C.,"Elk Grove, CA",115,22,4,1.0,9/1/2015,"More and more I'm seeing restaurants jack up the prices and give less food for it. On 8/31/2015 we went  to the Arcadia Cheesecake Factory for dinner and I ordered the Pit Beef Dip sandwich. I chose the salad over the fries. I asked if I can have iceberg lettuce instead of the typical bitter lettuce they serve. The waitress brought a very small bowl of just iceberg lettuce. No cucumber, no tomato, no croutons, or anything else! To top it off, I noticed the very, very small sandwich on my plate. We're talking Mac Donald's small cheeseburger size with a little bit of meat and onions, and a small 1oz saucer of the dip. I'm not kidding. I've had roast beef sandwiches, but this was a joke. I wish I was joking for paying $14!  I informed the waitress that this was not at all what I was expecting.  She said well our normal greens come with the vegetables you want, but you ordered iceberg sir. Yes, I replied, I asked for a iceberg ""Salad"". Not a small bowl for a turtle to feed off of lettuce only. Wow! The manager delivered the same size bowl of lettuce with the addition of vegetables this time. I informed him right off that I was not trying to be rude, but for $14 this was a very small portion of food. The manager had a smug look on his face acting like this was actually normal. He was NOT apologetic and asked if there was something else I wanted. I said no thank you, and told him that I was giving feedback only. Now I know it's not the manager's fault, and not the waitresses fault regarding the serving of food we get.

Erica L.,"Los Angeles, CA",598,245,1506,1.0,1/30/2012,"Curse me for succumbing to a free meal, thinking it'd be a good -- nay, decent -- meal.  My boyfriend and I came to the Cheesecake Factory based on the fact that we'd accumulated $100 in gift cards, and thought, ""Might as well use it!""  Neither of us had been to a Cheesecake Factory since our college days, and we were about to get a swift kick in the pants of *why*. WAIT SERVICE: We walked into this cavernous restaurant, and wondered who decorated the interiors.  Utterly garish and gauche, the interiors reeked of McMansion.  We were quickly seated by front of house, and our waiter, after a brief introduction, the general fetching of water, and taking of our order, told us he was going on his 30 minute break.  We had previously joked that there was so much choice in the menu (indeed it reads like a small book), so I innocently asked, ""And what will you be eating on your break?""  Initially jovial and casual in attitude, he quickly replied, ""In and Out,"" followed by a short, stiff bark of a laugh.  Um, OK...  He then introduced his substitute waiter, who's name escapes me, but whose manner turned out to be utterly annoying.  He didn't win any favors when he made a completely unprofessional and racist comment right off the bat.  Then he proceeded to check in on us and our meal TOO often, with a smiling, obsequious, over-compensating manner that just made me want to reach out and slap him (I did not, for fear he'd spit in our food).    When it came down to the ordering of dessert time, he told us to ""take our time,"" and then never returned to take our order.  WTF?  First TOO much checking in, then leaving us in the cold?  Seriously un-smooth.  Our original waiter finally returned and by then, we weren't at all appetized for dessert, having been turned off from the wait service in general, choosing instead to order dessert to-go.   FOOD: We decided, since we weren't famished, we'd order several appetizers, share a salad, and indulge in Cheesecake Factory's dessert.  After all, that's what they're known for, right?  As pescatarians, the choices are slim.  We ordered: Stuffed Mushrooms, Pear and Brie Flatbread, and Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip, plus a Seared Tuna Salad.  Sounds pretty good right?  In reality: completely under-whelming.  The mushrooms were OK, the Flatbread decent, but the Crab and Artichoke Dip was just plain gross.  Have you ever had a cheap, warm tub of seafood-flavored mayonnaise?  Yes, that's what makes this dip so overly-rich, and undigestible.  Note to the Head Chef: there are other food seasonings other than fat. The salad was OK, but surprisingly, wasn't large in portion, so the both of us ended up hungry, and unsatisfied (for $53, that's leaves a lot to be desired).  As for dessert, by the time I got my Oreo cookies 'n cream milkshake and slice of Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake in my hands, my stomach was doing flips from the crab dip.  I felt nauseated, and couldn't wait to get home to nurse my tummy with peppermint tea.   It's not that the food's inedible.  It's just that it's wanna-be good food, and not prepared with much love.  Cheesecake Factory might appear ""successful"" since its a chain, and it's known for its huge portions, however, more does not necessarily mean better.  I now remember why I never returned to this place after my one experience during college, and even though we still have remaining credit on our gift card, after looking through CF's menu and last night's dining experience, there's nothing remotely enticing about this place or its food that I'd return to order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=540

Summer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,681,3,1.0,3/27/2013,"Aww, shucks. I come here too often due to its convenience in location. However, today was not as good as usual! What happened? I had a ""Slice of Joy"" gift card that granted one slice of complimentary cheesecake that my best friend gave me for Xmas that was expiring, so I nudged my fiance to come here. In addition, I also had a gift card that I used half of that I wanted to finish. Hey, that was a good enough incentive, right? Well, WRONG. First of all, there was a wait on a Wednesday evening! We actually had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table when there were clearly a few tables open! Holy cow. Second of all, the waitress was very inattentive. She took almost 10 minutes to come acknowledge herself. We kept looking around and I kept wondering who our server was! And when she did take our order, and we asked for lemon with our iced water, she forgot it! She was also not very communicative. Third of all, my Bistro Shrimp Pasta has deteriorated in quality! I haven't had it in a while, because I usually order salad at Cheesecake Factory, but today I felt like pasta and it did not deliver. The sauce was too sour (and lemony), and the whole dish was too high in fat and cholesterol content. It just wasn't a good combo. Fiance's salad was not that good as well. He wasn't that excited to eat it. Fourth of all, I got a stomach ache after my dish! It was not pleasant. What happened, Cheesecake Factory? I hope it steps up their game before our next visit. We usually come here a few times a month but today just wasn't good. Fortunately, though, we did bring home a Banana Creme Cheesecake (per our complimentary gift card), so I did get to indulge a little after my stomach ache and aftermath was situated.

As all of the other posters have said, the menu has literally anything and everything you could possibly want to eat on it (over 200 entrees, I am told), which makes it a great place if you don't really know what you want. Unlike most restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory does not have a signature entree (only their signature dessert), so the food is basically part of a ""cast your net wide so that we can get them to eat the Cheesecake"" strategy (clever!).  I had the Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Pizza with a side Caesar Salad, which was definitely delicious. Of course, no review of the Cheesecake Factory would be complete without a review of the cheesecake...I have to admit that I skipped their signature dessert on this visit because I was stuffed, but I've had it several times before and I can tell you unreservedly that it's absolutely incredible.

Our waitress was really bored, and wasn't very attentive. She didn't check on us except to order food. It took her ten minutes to get me another menu so I could order an appetizer that came AFTER my food. What's the point of an appetizer then? The food took a while to come, but at least it somewhat satisfied in that department.  The chicken enchiladas were decent, but when they stated it came with a ""side"" of beans I didn't assume they filled half the plate with beans!

The last two times I didn't even get my food it took so long. The last time I even asked ""I need to get back to work in a hour and will need my food within 30 minutes, is that OK?"" 50 minutes later I was out the door with a bill for food I never got. If you have less than two hours to wait JUST TO GET YOUR FOOD, then don't waste your time. Hell don't waste your time at all with all the great choices to eat at in Pasadena!

It comes with spaghetti in a buttery garlic sauce, lightly breaded shrimp, mushrooms, tomatoes and topped off with a bed of arugula (YUUUUMMMM). But I did order the shrimp pops and they were excellent! My son loves their fish and chips. Taste like H-salt but better!  The bread and butter they place on the table before your meal is addictive so be careful. I really wish they'd bring back the pecan pie cheesecake.

The egregious part however came when I ordered a tiramisu for dessert.  I was halfway through it when I clamped down on what I thought was a piece of chocolate shaving, but which however proved difficult to chew.  What I pulled out was a sharp jagged shard of solid black plastic about one inch by one inch!!!  I was extremely infuriated that such an object, a potential choking hazard, by whatever means, found itself in something meant to be consumed and enjoyed. The manager shortly came over to our table and apologized, even offered to call a paramedic which I declined even though my teeth was hurt from biting the plastic shard; nevertheless, I found the manager to be insincere, as if it is normally the case he makes appearances on the dining floor to assuage unhappy diners. I've been disappointed with this cheesecake factory half of the time (ranging from orange juice-drenched orange chicken, to an overly-salted kobe burger), and the other half is at best decent and edible.  The plastic in my dessert is highly unacceptable, and is the last straw for me to ever consider dining there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=780

Reasonable prices, good food, large menu with a variety of items, and a ""low cal"" menu, too. I really like the Meatloaf lunch / dinner here. Nicely seasoned, well cooked, just a bit of char at the edges. The Greek salad is delicious, fried macaroni and cheese a treat, and the burgers and appetizers are great, as well. One small thing I can nitpick about is the ""fried cheese"" appetizer isn't really fried cheese, but rather breaded cheese sticks which are then fried. The fried macaroni and cheese are simply small scoops, breaded and fried as well. But to be honest both snacks lack the flavor of good deep fried food and could have  been baked from all I can tell by texture and taste. Not crisp in the least, but not soggy, either. I wouldn't get the fried cheese again, but the fried macaroni and cheese, sure. It's good, just not as decadent as it's name suggests. And unless you request otherwise it's served on a bed of marinara sauce. Do yourself a favor of flavor, and get the sauce on the side.   Service has always been nice and friendly if casual, and I love the outdoor dining area here. It's great for people watching while having a meal. Lot's of mall goers coming and....going. Inside is nicely done, also. But noisy it seems even with just several tables being served.

In high school I used to come here for dinner before my formal dances. I am always satisfied with their food and the cheesecakes are bomb. The menu gives you more than enough options to choose from. Service can be slow sometimes especially for dinner since this place is so popular and mainly located around shopping malls. There's a bar inside that serves good mixed drinks and you're welcome to eat at the bar too. When you're seated they used to give a small basket of complimentary bread but now I noticed that you have to ask them for it.  For starters, I love soup so I would ask what the soup of the day is (Small $5 Large $7) and so far I like the Wild Mushroom Soup. I usually order the Factory Combination of Steak Diane (med rare) and Herb Crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus ($20). The steak is full of flavor with pepper and mushrooms. The salmon tastes fresh and moist. The mashed potatoes are buttery and I love the potato skins in there. I know TCF is not the healthiest as it's packed with thousands of calories! However, they do offer a Skinnylicious menu that offers lower calorie items but haven't gotten around to it since I only go here for my usuals. The bf loves pasta and usually orders the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo ($17). It's creamy and the chicken is not bland at all. Lastly, how could you not order dessert at Theee Cheesecake factory. I've tried numerous cheesecakes here (about $7 a piece) and I can't remember all of them but the most recent I've had is the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and The White Chocolate Macadamia Caramel Cheesecake (ain't that a mouth full!).

Alan K.,"Monterey Park, CA",472,653,10,4.0,1/15/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory never really disappoints whenever I come here. The food here is not superb, but they have quite a selection most of which is of high quality. I think the prices here match what they give you, especially since the portions here are pretty huge.  FOOD QUALITY: Of all the food that I've ordered here, they all come in big sizes and there is a certain richness to every item.  Factory Meatloaf is one thing that I usually get -- there's three slices of meatloaf, served with gravy, grilled onions and mushrooms. Alongside that are slightly buttered mash potatoes and peppered corn & bell pepper bits. Meatloaf is soft and full of flavor. Mash potato melts in your mouth and helps break down the meatloaf bits, while the corn gives you a slight crunch from the plumpness. Pastas are usually not a letdown since they do slightly different things that you would not normally find in a restaurant (unless you order the basic things.. which I avoid) Louisana Chicken was one of my recent discoveries and that was delicious! Cajun style bowtie pasta with flaky fried chicken. Pasta cooked to perfection and the flakiness from the chicken definitely added a lovely subtle texture of crunch into the pasta. Flavors were strong, but was definitely oily. Other pastas are pretty good (Farfalle and the chipotle liguini are the two others that I tried) Fish and Chips were pretty good too, but not the best I've had.  Marsala Chicken was also good, but there was a lot of bowtie pasta that came along with that.  SERVICE: Is usually friendly, polite, and attentive. They offer to refill your waters, oblige to give you more bread, and sometimes the manager comes around to see how the service is. One time we commented that our food was late and they gave us a free cheesecake for dessert.. D: ENVIRONMENT: This is a huge place. There are a lot of tables so I don't think I've ever felt that my personal bubble space was violated. I hear this place gets crowded but I usually come here right as they open for lunch or early for dinner crowd.  I like coming here and this is a certainly a place that I'd suggest if I had to eat around the area. Good food. Oh wait. I forgot to comment about the Cheesecake here. YUUUUUUUMMMMM! Rich.

I mean if you have to ask then you have been living under a rock or you're lactose intolerant. Parking here can be a pain in the @ss on weekend nights.  They have a large parking structure on the backside of the restaurant but it is usually packed by everyone that is trying to get into the AMC movie theatre.  They have a valet service available right in front of the restaurant but keep in mind that this valet also serves the entire mall, so they do get busy.  Also anytime you use the valet service please at least tip the valet at least a couple of bucks for running through the parking lot to get your car back.  If you don't mind a little walk the second floor of the small parking structure on the south east side of the mall usually has open spots for the dinner/movie festivities, but during the day it is as full as any where else you decide to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=560

The women's bathroom was almost devoid of toilet paper in every one of the five stalls. The paper towels were overflowing from the garbage bin and the paper towel dispenser closest to the door was empty. The seat covers were out in at least one of the stalls. I was told by our waitress that there is usually a female hostess on duty who can check the women's bathroom, but one wasn't scheduled that night. I spoke to the manager about it. He apologized, but didn't do anything about to remedy the situation. Fifteen minutes later, I went to see if anything had been done and it hadn't.

I been here many times and can say that the service is sometimes unbelievable. Sometimes servers are really not paying attention. From waiting for drinks to taking the order could be a very long process. Also sometimes the food order is not done right be it that you didn't want a certain ingredient in the food or vegetable, it will still be in the plate you ordered.  I came here once with a table of 8 just for a casual lunch dining experience with a few friends. Got a few drinks and that was fine. But when it came to the food they were missing three dishes and it took them 30 minutes while having to send one back.  I asked to speak to the manager and they did give everyone on our table free slices of cheesecake for the mess up! Also taking 10 percent out of the bill.

I won't say any positive or negative things about their food. I give them 3.5 stars on food, but the service lever is 3 stars at best and the waiting and the crowd noise will keep me away until there's an occasion to bring me back.

Mona C.,"Santa Ana, CA",18,121,132,1.0,11/9/2013,"Wow.  Had a really disappointing dinner here. The first time I came here the food was just ok-very fried and greasy. Like many others, I was impressed by their variety but having worked in the restaurant business, I know variety rarely allows for consistency or any specialty at all. I guess the only specialty here is their cheesecake.  My reason for the one star is that I came here for dinner and had chicken sliders that tasted like greasy KFC. I was also told they have no MSG free options and their gluten free menu appeared very limited. After notifying the waitress that I did not enjoy my entree of choice at all, all she said was ""Ohhhh."" In a sad tone. That's all. No apology. No questions. No suggestions for a different item. And as if that didn't outrage me enough, she had the nerve to follow up her shallow 'ohh' with ""well, and room for dessert?"" Really?!...no thanks Cheesecake Factory-you've failed to impress me at all. ....your cheesecake is good-but that's about it.

The regular dinner sizes can range around $16. Fettuccine Alfredo was a bit too creamy for my liking, and the Smoked Salmon was kind of bland. I would try it with the herbs next time.

Hanson T.,"Los Angeles, CA",372,204,1558,4.0,4/5/2013,"I avoided The Cheesecake Factory for the longest time because I had the misconception that no respectable establishment would or could ever serve good food in a shopping center, and especially not near a food court. Big mistake on my part because this place has stellar service and serves amazing food in bloat-inducing portions.  No idea what it's like at other locations, but the service here is excellent, comparable to what you'd experience at a higher-end restaurant. On both of my visits, my waiters were lightning fast, attentive, helpful, unabashed and simply awesome. Their suggestions made ordering for a first-timer much easier, especially considering the huge selection of items. No blunders were made with our orders, and our servers were so great that I wouldn't have been bothered if there had been.  While there's nothing wrong with the ambiance inside, I prefer their outdoor seating. It was a bit stuffy when I sat inside, but I enjoyed every minute of my outside dining experience.  Even on a chilly night, the patio heater hovering over our table kept us warm and cozy. Definitely consider getting a table outside, if there's one available.  We had to wait a bit before our entrees arrived, but the baskets of complimentary bread kept us occupied. To our shock, our waiter confirmed that the brown bread we kept requesting was actually just their version of wheat bread. Still, it was seriously addictive, and I would have loved to take a couple of loaves home.  I had the Chicken Madeira with mashed potatoes on my first visit, and it was phenomenal. Covered under a layer of melted cheese and glazed with sweet, succulent mushroom Madeira sauce, was a large piece of  sautéed chicken breast. My knife cut cleanly into the chicken and each bite of meat was delightfully moist and tender. On a subsequent visit, I had the Hibachi Steak. Though it didn't taste quite as exquisite as the Chicken Madeira, the steak was well-seasoned and cooked exactly to my preference, and I found it similarly satisfying. On both occasions, my entree was served with a side of mashed potatoes, which had the rich, creamy consistency typical of traditional mashed potatoes, nuanced by a mixture of textural elements, transforming a household side dish into an appetizing pleasure. Neither the steak nor chicken were visually impressive and I could feel the pounds packing on as my meal progressed, but compromising my diet for delicious food was a tradeoff I was prepared to make.  We found most of their desserts to be less enjoyable. The Godiva chocolate sundae was good for the first few bites, but it quickly became a chore to finish. The Oreo cheesecake was equally decadent, with flavors far too rich for a palate accustomed to tasting sweets in moderation. Even when shared between my entire party, the desserts remained unfinished. We avoided a chocolate-based dessert altogether on our second visit, and opted for the mango key lime cheesecake instead. While still a tad too sweet, the cheesecake was good, and something I could actually eat a whole slice of.  The Cheesecake Factory is a reliable chain that features a relatively unchanging, but comprehensive and diverse menu, making it a suitable choice for any occasion and a great destination for groups that have trouble deciding where to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=460

This is a great location and closer to our place.. Parking is plenty in the weekday.. I can't imagine parking here in the weekend because I'd rather go to a pho shop close by than kill myself looking for parking at the Westfield (Santa Anita) Mall.. We came here around lunch time..

The butter was kinda semi melted when I was unwrapping it.. I just used once cube and wiped the whole thing on a huge chunk of bread.. I don't like the white bread that much.. Then came the fried calamari... Each calamari wasn't too breaded and it's not as crunchy as the ones in Chinese restaurants.. But it wasn't bad dipped in garlic and cocktail sauce.  Then came both of our orders.. The American Kobe beef burger has sauteed mushrooms and onions on a toasted Brioche Bun. The tomato and lettuce where separated on the side. It came with the sweet potato fries  . Now these were good, crunchy and not salty.. I tasted her Kobe beef and it was pretty tasty  . The chef overcooked it a little.. We ordered it to be medium well not well done..  The chinese chicken salad has sliced chicken breast, lettuce, green onions, almonds, crisp wontons, bean sprouts, orange and sesame seeds. Tossed in a special Chinese plum dressing... This is way better than the Caesar Salad I ordered a months ago..   For dessert, we ordered the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae..  Godiva chocolate brownie, vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream and toasted almonds...

Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2377,8717,4.0,12/12/2011,"I like cheesecake factory because of the variety of items on their menu, their attempt to offer ""skinny"" lower calorie options and of course for their cheesecakes. This location can get pretty crowded during weekend evenings, but so far I've been pretty lucky to get seated w/in 5 minutes of walking in (during the weekend evenings, I usually come around 8 pm or later).  So far the service has been pretty good. It is easy to find a server if I need something and the kitchen makes foods to my special requests (I always ask for salad dressing on the side and if I order a sandwich or a burger, I always ask for it to be cut in half. It is just easier to eat this way).  One of my favorite appetizers to order is the Thai lettuce wraps. Although this is an appetizer, this really is like a full on meal that you could share w/ 2 or 3 other people. The 3 different sauces are absolutely perfect and has a nice balance with the chicken and veggies that you can wrap up in a lettuce cup. I love the way this dish is plated because it looks just beautiful.  I have tried probably about half of the cheesecakes so far and someday would like to try all of them. I especially love to go during the holidays when the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake is available.  A few things that I do have some complaints about this place is that at night, the lighting is too dim for me. I wish the restaurant had more lights. I get that since it is in the evening they want to make it more of a romantic atmosphere, but I would prefer just a tad bit more light. Also the floors here are a bit slippery. I don't know if they wax the floors or not, but they really shouldn't. I've seen a few people slip when walking on the floors and I sometimes I feel like I am going to slip when I get up from my table and walk over to the restrooms.   Generally the service here is pretty good, but it just depends on what server you get. I have had a server who was very attentive and very friendly. But I have also had a server who was absent during the entire meal, until it was time to pay for the check.

I have no complaints about the soup and the salad, but the turkey sandwich was a bit dry IMO. :\  Some of my favorites at CF : Louisana Ckn Pasta Pasta Da Vinci  Buffalo Blasts Fried Calamari Factory Nachos Shrimp Scampi  Spicy Ckn Chipotle Pasta A+ on the environment & service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=820

Tawny A.,"Newport, RI",210,641,231,1.0,8/24/2009,"So I am allergic to mushrooms. This is something I always mention to the wait staff where-ever I go. I will not necessarily swell up and die, but I will have trouble breathing and a awful tummy ache will follow. ONE WOULD THINK.......that the staff at a major restaurant such as Cheesecake Factory would know what the components of the dishes they offer are......... I do not go to CF a lot. Maybe once a year, if that. But I always tend to get the Pasta Da Vinci. And I order it with no mushrooms and I always say that I am allergic to stress the importance of not having them put in the damn dish. Its not a 5 star place where modifications are frowned upon. Its a national chain and customer service is stressed there. BUT after I ordered the Pasta Da Vinci takeout the other night and there were mushrooms in it.....the RUDE manager informed me that the sauce itself is mushroom based. So of course he didn't believe me that I am allergic. Here is the thing......I don't do a lot of dairy but sometimes you just need a slice of cheesecake......so usually when I get the pasta dish, I have cheesecake. So if I don't feel well after I always assumed I ate too much or blamed it on the cake. Ok. I admit my fault here. But If I say to a waiter, no mushrooms because I am allergic and they fail to mention that the dish is mushroom based sauce....even though the mushrooms are not visible.....where is the blame?  The problem here is the rude manager who said he would call me back rather than apologize and help me out. I had to go back to the restaurant and talk to a different manager to clear the mess up. All I wanted was a refund. I brought the pasta back. I have told everyone I work with, all my friends and my dentist office about this place and I hope that at least 30 of them never go there again. Maybe it won't impact them at all....but please.....if you love food, do not eat at a place that cares so little for the well being of their patrons. can't people take legal action for crap like this? huh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=820
Sharon S.,"Torrance, CA",157,348,7,3.0,6/21/2010,"My opinion of this place is a little... wobbly. Uneven. Maybe even locally inconsistent.

She made sure to keep us updated, which I thought was nice.  However, when we got to our table, the waitress was kind of... abrupt? Now, I understand we're being seated at a time that's precariously close to the time they shut down, but still... Please don't bark out the question, ""Can I grab that plate?"" and then snatch it from across the table.  Plus, the gal forgot to take half the table's drink order. Lame-ness. The food is decent- the spinach dip was delish, and the Miso Salmon was very moist. Sadly, it didn't warm up so well the next day. By the time we could have ordered dessert, the boy and I were ready to pass out, so sadly we didn't get to enjoy any of the lacto-licious offerings. This place has a good location- near a mall, so you can get your consumerist urges taken care of, then gorge yourself on cheesecake. (Hey, sounds like a good day to me!)

I've had everything from their calamari to pizza to the chicken and pasta dishes. And man no one does mashed potatoes and broccoli like the cheesecake factory. Who would think that such simple items could be so delicious when soaked in butter. Haha. It's actually very sad that I don't remember the name of my favorite dish here--it's been awhile--but it's simply breaded chicken breasts fillets cooked in a white wine sauce. This paired with the broccoli and mashed potato side dishes is making my mouth water just now. This dish is so astonishing and flavorful that that dish itself earns a 5 star. Although the food here is probably not good for health-conscious people, I think an exception can be made because the food here is just too good to pass up. Even the free bread they give you is amazing. The honey wheat bread is the best, the sourdough is ok.  I don't remember how the service was because all I could think of was the food. But with great tasting food, who cares about the service so long as you get your food.  Fyi, parking near the restaurant sucks, so come at a weird time to eat or else you'll get really frustrated from looking for parking.

The menu is ginormous with dare I say something for everyone. The portions are fairy huge but so are the prices.  Food:  Once again gigantic menu. You would think they a restaurant would focus on a theme...not the case here...you can order American, European. Asian, and Mexican influenced dishes here. Great place for groups where people have different preferences in food. The food is decent which is expected per reputation but definitely can be better. Service:  Very slow service. Given I went with a group of 15..still service was lacking quite a bit. It took awhile before I even got a plate on my table. The dish I ordered had raw chicken....in which the waitress was shocked and didn't know what to do (she took the raw chicken in but not the rest of the plate).  Environment:  It took me awhile to realize I was eating raw chicken. I thought to myself this is way too moist for chicken breast. We couldn't really tell because it was so dark it there. We eventually busted out 3 cell phones and confirmed Mr. Raw chicken was being eaten by yours truly. The restaurant is quite loud not a place where I would bring a date. I expected a bit more eligance based on design...but not the case here.  Price:  Well its not the most expensive place you can choose, but for the food I'm expecting a little more.  Overall lacking experience.  Food: 3 Service: 2 Environment: 2 Price: 2",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=640

I love the way the Cheesecake Factory chain displays their desserts right at the entrance for hungry people waiting to be seated. They simply can't help gazing at the display case full of cheesecakes and delicious things. I know it's odd to give a review about the dessert counter, but that was my sole reason for being inside. I've been here during normal daylight hours and when it's packed, and it's just like most other Cheesecake Factory restaurants - but I was really just tickled to talk with Alyssa about our favourite desserts, and she was very helpful and very evil, showing my dessert cohort the different cheesecakes by pulling them out so he could get a closer look.

This place is pretty good, and it brings back a lot of memories.  The service here is great. The waiters and waitresses are always nice. I used to go with 15-20 of my friends back when we were a bit younger, rowdier, and more annoying, and even then, they treated us well. Though there is usually a wait for tables, particularly during mealtimes, they would provide us with a vibrating notifier, which shakes when a table is available. It lets us roam around the mall while we wait, so we will not be bored. The food here is delicious as well. I usually order a four-cheese pasta and share it with one or two other people. The portions are large, so even when two or three people are splitting an entree, we get pretty filled up. The appetizers here are wonderful as well. However, eating here is a little pricey. Expect to pay at least $15 for lunch per entree, including tax and tip. They used to include tip in the total bill, but now they don't. Though it's a bit expensive, I think the portion size makes up for how much it costs. Their food and service are great, so I'll give it 5-stars, even though it's a little expensive.

The small dishes are expensive and small 1)crab bite , 2) beet salad, 3)flat bread is a joke. $6 for smaller than a slice of pizza! can not imagine why anybody would pay regular price. I like the deep fried combo; avocado, mushroom and zucchini but at $7 for happy hours is still not cheap.I wish they offer deep fried calamari, onion rings, chicken wings and soup for appetizer's (Yard house). drinks  for $5 is good. 3 # stars rating is for happy hours only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=640

Unfortunately by the time they got to our table they were in a bad mood I guess and only 3 ppl showed up.. and to the other tables we saw at least 5 to 6 ppl... that's not even the worst part! They didn't even pretend to be happy only one person was smiling while singing and they sounded like they were mumbling the words their clap was very weak too.

(it's from 4pm-6pm at the bar) all their appetizers are $5 and the alcohol is 50% off. my friend and i ordered their hot spinach artichoke dip and chicken taquitos. both the food and the portion was good. again, the restaurant failed to impress me with their service... the waiter barely came to check up on us. honestly, cheesecake is not somewhere i would go on a daily basis, but if you are around the area and need a place to eat that is cheap, then just stop by during their happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=640

Brought a friend here for lunch for her birthday, her choice. It was pretty empty for lunch time - really surprised. We were seated right away, the waitress came to greet us and told us the specials, and took our drink orders. Waitress was real attentive (probably cuz it was so empty there). Basket of bread was brought out to us right away -  I order the cuban sandwich - it was really good. Big portions, as I was only able to finish half of it. You have the choice of fries or salad. You can get regular fries or the sweet potato fries, I got the regular. My friend got some pasta dish. The pasta didnt look very good, at least for my taste. But my friend said it was good.  The waitress boxed up everything for us, and then offered us some cheesecake, we passed on that. But the new Reese Peanut Butter cup one looked really good. I wouldve gotten one to go, but it was crazy hot and didnt think it would survive the ride home. Maybe next time. This was probably one of the best experiences Ive had in a Cheesecake Factory.

Lynn L.,"Tustin, CA",78,45,22,3.0,7/2/2011,"Cheesecake factory is a good restaurant for a not-too-expensive first date. The food is nicely plated. Patio seating is good during summer time. They invested a lot of money in the interior decoration of the restaurant giving it an upscale ambience. Food is above average, generally NOT healthy. The dishes I recommend are:  Cobb salad, Luau Salad: these are entree salad that will fill you up! With the dressing, calorie count is almost the same as a burger with fries. Have dressing on the side and go easy, so you won't ruin a week's workout with one meal.  Shrimp Scampi: good and buttery. Usually served with mash potato or linguini, subsitute for veggies as a healthier option.  Steak Diane: It's served with Madeira wine sauce with mushrooms, sweet and savory. sauce can be greasy some times, but flavor is good.  New Orlean Shrimp: good cajun flavor, light and not greasy. It's one of my favorites! Gumbo with Chicken and Shrimp: simillar to New Orlean shrimp, but it has heavy cream. Recommended if you are in for something hearty.  I can go on and on because their menu is so big. I love the brunch menu. Recommend the Baja Chicken Hash, Egg's Benedict.  Of course, don't forget Cheesecake. They are yummy but each slice has  800 to 1200 calories!! Remember to get a slice to share and not to over eat!

My family and I are playful with our servers, my brother and I are servers ourselves so we want to make the experience enjoyable for everyone. Well, we thanked Jeff for everything and said we had great service, however, when he brings the bill gratuity was added.  It clearly states it is added for parties of SIX or more. So Jeff and apparently the manager agreed to add gratuity.  This is hugely disappointing, for some reason Jeff and the manager judged my family and thinking we would not tip.  We did not say anything, nor want anything for the disappointment, we just will not go back.  We are great tippers and would have actually tipped a lot more than what was added, but the principle of the matter is he did not deserve it after all.  That shows poor character on JEFF and the restaurant.

This Cheesecake Factory is big which is what I like most about it. The Pasadena location is way too small.  The decor here is like most Cheesecake Factories; it is very nice and clean. The service here is great; I have had very friendly waiters every time I have come. The food here is great. Starting off with their bread, it is very delicious especially when it is warm and fresh. The French baguette and wheat bread are both fantastic! My favorite is the wheat though. Hands down. The last time I came I ate from their new skinnylicious menu. I ordered the shrimp soft tacos. They were very tasty, fresh, and juicy. I loved how they were only 500 calories and only 3-4 grams of fat. Most of the items from their regular menu, though tasty and big portioned, are calorie-packed and filled with saturated fat. If you do not care about the nutritional facts, try their pasta dishes, steaks, seafood, steak and seafood combos, and all their other entrees. I can guarantee you they will be of good quality. For dessert, definitely try their variety of cheesecakes. Some of my personal favorites are the vanilla bean cheesecake, the oreo cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake, the red velvet cheesecake (though at times too sweet for my taste), and many others ! The price is pretty standard for a restaurant like this. For an entree, drink, and dessert, it's about $30 a person (depending on your entree).

Timmy L.,"El Monte, CA",35,12,,3.0,3/1/2009,"Cheesecake factory is basically American that costs more for a classier setting. To be honest, I felt it almost like an expensive Denny's and I felt I would've just been as happy eating at Denny's.There were a few more diverse dishes on the menu like miso seasoned salmon but not that many. The place is right by the mall so parking can be tough to find, especially if you want to park within easy walking distance. The inside is quite nice but the lighting is dimmer than some Olive Gardens I've been to and I remember my grandparents complaining that they couldn't read the menu. When it came to the food, it was not bad. . However, I kinda expect that since i was paying quite a few bucks more like $12 for a burger. A slice of cheesecake was like $7.25. Therefore, if you are going to try this place, you should be willing to spend the money. The portion sizes vary upon the dishes but in generally they can be quite large and the average person won't be able to eat more than a dish. 75% of the plate if you don't want to feel to full and have room for dessert.

First of all, I like the decoration in this restaurant. Pretty fancy in my opinion and the lighting is quite nice for a date. That said, I hate this place and will probably never come back again, or to any Cheesecake factory perhaps. I came only because my friend wanted to try it and its his birthday. We waited over 1.5 hr to be seated. Why? Because the pager malfunction on us. Not once, but two times! Failed to vibrate both times. Funniest thing was that I was standing by the front desk where they were activating the pagers. The hostress even knew my name, put my name down both times, and saw me stood right in front of her! You would think she will have the smarts to recognized that she paged my name and didnt go up and maybe something was wrong? Ugh..waited 45 min first time. Another 45 min 2nd time. Had to go up to her the 3rd time to tell her that the pager failed AGAIN! Finally got a sit after waiting 1.5 hr.  Make sure you go up and check if you dont get paged within 20 min! Food was only okay. If i wanted Italian food or some kind of sandwich, I would go to an Italian restaurant or sandwich specialty restaurant. I thought they might have something fancy, but no. Totally overpriced too. I love cheesecakes, especially those that is a bit firm and not too sweet. But cheesecakes here? Blah. Too sweet and too soft. Maybe it was out of the freezer too long and the waiter didnt have time to go pick it up so it was melting by the time it got to us. Way too sweet. If you want diabetes, go eat their cheesecake.

I find it disturbing that they would put breaded shrimp in pasta. We wait and wait...then the foods comes out. I didn't get my food like everybody else - though I did order the same pasta dish as the birthday girl.

My plate has angel hair pasta, I didn't ask for angel hair plus it doesn't even come with angel hair. The fact that I was hungry and waited an hour for my meal got the better of me. I tried to send it back but the waitress resisted. There was absolutely no flavor that sauce ever touched the noodles and to make it worse my shrimp tasted unclean, grainy and very fishy.

Honestly, tables with no customers seating on them are just plain waste. Out of your own employee's convenience, you would rather have your customers wait 1~1.5 hours for the indoor seating.

Unfortunately the service was sooooo slow that our plans were derailed. (yeah, I know, not exactly big plans)   The pulled pork sandwich was horrible! A hamburger bun filled with what I swear was just a chopped up pork chop. PULLED PORK PEOPLE! Pull the dang pork!  Mediocre BBQ sauce to boot. My wife had the fish and chips. The cardboard....I mean batter, was as bland and tasteless as.....oh, ...yeah, cardboard. Same with the fries,  if you can call them that.  The cheesecake is the only redeeming quality about this place.  I should have gone to confession 'cause the cheesecake was sinfully delicious.  I begrudgingly went back a second time for a friend's birthday party. I thought ""Maybe it'll will be different this time""  My verdict still stands,  someone please euthanize this place.

There have been many people complaining about its prices but I think it's pretty reasonable. As long as you don't go for the steak or anything with red meat you are okay. A big bowl of pasta with chicken will set you back only $13. That's not too shabby! I came recently for a friends birthday party and we had 12 people and got seated within an hour during a busy Saturday. 30 minutes into your dinner, more friends showed up and they were very accommodating with arranging seats around to fit more guests. The servers were very polite and attentive. The only gripe I have about this place is the lighting can be too dim. I don't like to eat in darkness. Another tip would also be careful when you are walking to the restroom as the floors are always slippery and greasy around that area.

Tcmae E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,68,301,4.0,5/2/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia is outside the food court @ the Westfield Santa Anita Mall. This is probaly the best Cheescake Factory you can go to in this area, because the one in Glendale in Americana at Brand, and the one in Pasadena in Old Town is way more crowded than the one here. The one in Pasadena is always crowded and it is really small and tight, and not specious. The one in Glendale Americana, is also crowded, and when it first opened, it took 3 hours to get a table, with slow service. This one gets crowded during the peak lunch and dinner times, but there is a quick wait for a table if you come here in the afternoon at around 2 to 5. I came here at 3 on a Sunday, and we only had to wait 2 minutes so they can set up our table. The service is really good in this place, and really good food, and the menu for the Cheesecake Factory is big and extensive. I ordered the four cheese pasta which was really good, and which was really a big portion for a lunch portion. For dessert, I ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake which was also really good. Next time I go to The Cheesecake Factory, I will order the Factory Burger which looks good, which I wished I ordered, but I could't because I ate alot of burgers that week. For my drink, I ordered a stawberry smoothie which was also good blended with pineapple juice, and other fruit juices, but I told them not to put the coconut in it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=880

The food, especially considering the ridiculously and maybe even overly exaggerated menu selections usually always taste fantastic, and their consistently the same, any location you go to! Amazing ambiance, usually good service and again, awesome food. With all that being said...the last time my girlfriend and I went, we were seated outside and waited for at LEAST 30 minutes until we finally just got up and left. I'm sorry, service (and very rarely...food) comes first! How many times have you frequented a business with excellent service but with only mediocre products? Bad service leaves a bad taste in my mouth, sorry. Ironically, I think the fact that Cheesecake Factory prides themselves on good service it maybe the very reason I give them 2 stars.

As for their cheesecakes, I prefer the Craig's Crazy Carrot Cheesecake. It has some cheesecake and carrotcake mixed together. Out of most of the time, I prefer this cheesecake. Overall, I do enjoy Cheesecake Factory for their lunch portions because it's not too expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=720
Kenneth T.,"Los Angeles, CA",520,279,31,3.0,4/17/2009,"Cheesecake Factories are known to have atrocious wait times, but this one wasn't as bad. Plus, it is right in front of the Santa Anita mall so it makes waiting more bearable. Once you get it there, the atmosphere is not the best. Like the other locations, this places is really dark, like they don't want you to see your food. God knows what is in there. The food is pretty good, but for waiting 30 minutes and them charging $20 a dish in this economy, I expected more. One good pick is the Shrimp scampi and the chicken sandwich was delicious. Do not get a salad here. Why get a salad at this place? Go for the seafood and end your night with a cheesecake. The cheesecake is flavorful, but buy the whole cake instead of the slice (it is not worth it). Pretty much, the worst part of Cheesecake is the wait. It is really painful to wait here. Last time, it took me 30 minutes to drive there, drove around for 15 minutes for parking, waited 45 minutes for a table, and 30 minutes for my food to come. So pretty much it took my whole night. Two hours dedicated to getting warm food, and a $100 plus for 4 adults. Anything should taste good at this point. However, it was still not as bad as the Grove location, because I waited there for 75 minutes. With so many food choices in this area, I recommend the barbeque house next to it if you are as impatient as me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=720
Anila A.,"Long Beach, CA",87,75,7,4.0,4/26/2012,"Usually, I only go to Cheesecake Factory for their... cheesecakes. But yesterday, my boss and a few co-workers were invited to have dinner to celebrate Administrative Professionals Day (I didn't know we kinda people had those days! The rest of the calendar year is Step on Your Admins Day). We were greeted fairly well by one of the waitresses and was promptly seated thereafter. Our waiter, Casey or Keith was very nice and patient with our party of 8. He helped each and every one of us as we slowly trickled in. The strawberry lemonade was delicious, I stayed away from the complimentary bread and butter (need to shape up!), but ordered the salad and shrimp creole off of the skinnylicious menu (which by the way, I love!). The salad was a great size because it kept me from eating the entire entree. The entree size was enormous, but I knew if I didn't have that salad before, I would have eaten the whole thing! It was scrumptious! We then ordered cheesecake for ourselves and do I have to say anything else? It was so good (I only had a bite and saved the rest for my brother back at home--he could eat a horse and still weigh 120lbs).

Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",462,375,844,4.0,1/25/2010,"One of my favorite places to dine in when I'm in the neighborhood. The staff is extremely friendly and I'm still impressed by the little remotes they hand you in case there's a wait for a table on a busy night (especially on weekends). It vibrates and flashes when a table is ready for you and your party. Whether you come by yourself, with a date, or with a large group, the service is always impeccable and the atmosphere is classy but somewhat loud. The hostesses may not be warm, but every waitress/waiter I've had were upbeat and helpful.  The food here is excellent and anything you order comes in VERY generous portions for the price you pay relative to other restaurants. I can never finish a plate of food by myself and neither can most of my friends. My usual (& safe order) would be the Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes. It's exactly what the name says but without the word ""delicious,"" but don't bite into the tomatoes expecting something sweet because they're pretty sour. I've also had the Blackened Chicken Sandwich that comes with fries. It's served cut into two pieces and the sandwich itself is too big for me to take an actual bite out of it so it's a little messy to eat. I have to actually plan and work at eating it without getting pieces inside the sandwich from spewing out. Also, it's a very filling meal so it's probably best to share with a special someone or just a friend. If not, ask for the check and the waiter/waitress will happily box it up for you to-go! Just be careful with the sandwich though because the sauce soaks up into the bread really quickly, and before you know it, you'll have a soggy sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=720

They brought out all the things we needed fairly quickly though I questioned why they needed to bring salad dressing 25 minutes before our meals arrived.  I ordered the avocado rolls for an appetizer. I can't help but love those things. This Cheesecake Factory didn't fry them enough for me as the wrapper wasn't that crispy but then again, I appreciated the avocado wasn't a burning hot oozing mess.  I also had the chopped vegetable salad with chicken. There wasn't too much chicken but I didn't realize this salad would come with cheese so there ended up being enough protein after all. The pom dressing wasn't too tart.  I also snagged a couple of bites of chicken tenders from my friend's plate. My friends liked their cheesecake but I'm a cheesecake purist. I don't like fancy cheesecakes and will not eat them (with the exception of pumpkin cheesecake during the holidays).

I've also tried their garlic noodles, it wasn't very flavorful, couldn't really taste anything.. really. That day, I had a SERIOUS craving for shrimps.. so i just HAD to get that. The Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic was the better one of the mix. It's not too salty, not too sweet. Love the garlic. Perfect! I also enjoy the flexibility of being able to change up the pasta. You see, I love the dish ""Shrimp with Angel Hair "" EXCEPT the angel hair part, I requested for bow tie pasta instead and it was great! LIKE i said though, for the okay tasting food, i would probably go elsewhere. This location tends to be pretty packed on weekends too. I was with a group of 10-11 and our ""expected"" wait time was 2 hours. So we just chose the outdoor.. which wasn't so bad at all. It's pretty chilly at night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=760

You'll never have the best meal of your life there, or the best service, but it will always be far from the worst. I'm not a fan of the cheesecake ironically. I'm from New York, I like New York style cheesecake, not this stuff they serve here. By the way, on this past trip our waiter Eric was fantastic.

Yes, you are paying a bit more money here, but the quality is wonderful. The chefs also put in extra effort to make your dishes look perfect. If you come here for lunch with a buddy, you should just order a dinner-sized entree, rather than a lunch-sized one, and share. They are huge! It's also a good idea if you are watching your calorie-intake. This is kind of ironic, but I don't really come here for their Cheesecakes. I find them much too sweet for my taste. The pastas are much more delectable. Their chicken and steaks are always cooked perfectly.  This is a wonderful place to go out on a date, especially if you do not want to kill your wallet. Yes, it will make a make a minor dent in your wallet, but on the bright side, your tummy will  be very satisfied afterwards!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=760
Icy L.,"El Monte, CA",117,100,567,5.0,10/22/2008,"I love about their everything but their price (I'm poor, so to me, it is expensive) and cheesecake. The drinks there are the best thing ever! I love their Hawaiian pizza and pasta!!! Orange Chicken is a bit sour. Cheesecakes, well, I don't really know what's up but I like frozen Cheesecakes better. But I love their food overall! The service is outstanding and the interior design is to die for! However, it's a bit of crowed, at least that's how I felt. Although it is located in the mall, parking is still pain the the ass (excuse my language). Also, another down side is, if you are going on a weekend, either you reverse a table in advance or you'll have to get ready to wait for an hour or more. (I tried and it's not fun!) Although they do give a little call machine thingy, but it's only works up to certain distance, so you really can't walk around the mall.  There's also a full bar, but I never went there. Although, what I do know is, they have a TV of sports/gamble stuff etc over the bar. The place is a bit loud plus the background music, it's louder. There's also out door seating, where smoking is allowed. Outside is crowed as well. There are two sides to the outdoor seating. One is facing the street (where all the parking is at) so there's not much to see. Another is to the side of entrance, where facing and next to other restaurants. So you'll see LOTS of people walking and seating doing nothing. However, the only thing about this side is you'll get to see the decoration lights turning colors- it's pretty but if you stare at it for a while, it gets boring. But hey, it's better looking at parked cars.

Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",413,1590,952,4.0,5/5/2009,"First off, the décor is gorgeous. I don't know the correct term to describe it- very European and old-worldly. It kinda reminded me of some of those casinos in Vegas actually. This Cheesecake Factory is located adjacent to the Santa Anita mall and is much bigger than the one in Pasadena A bunch of co-workers and I came on a weekday for lunch so it wasn't busy at all and there was plenty of parking. The server was nice enough, even helping to pour the ketchup for us (the secret is to hit the ""57"" on the bottle). But since he already earned his 18% gratuity due to our large group, he probably wasn't as attentive as he could have been.  The menu is extensive, which is probably part of the appeal of the Cheesecake Factory, everything from pasta to comfort food to Asian dishes.  I've been there many times and have yet to even try a quarter of the menu. But first came the bread and drinks. The strawberry lemonade is delicious - not as good as Red Robins (who puts actual strawberries in the drink). It was pricey at almost five dollars but still managed to hit the spot. And one of my favorite parts of the meal is the dark bread (rye?). I could pretty much live on that bread. One downside is that the food took awhile to come out so I filled up on the bread, lemonade and their free refills. I ended up getting a pizzette from their new small plate and snacks menu ($3.95 -$6.50), which are advertised as appetizers and I think just the right size if you want a light lunch. Or in my case, because I wanted to save room for cheesecake. The rest of the group got a variety of pastas and sandwiches off the lunch special menus. The portions are still ginormous and the presentation of the food was very nice too.  The pizzette was good - thin crust with sausage and ricotta cheese, not too oily with about 5 small slices. Then I ordered the 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake. It was definitely rich with four layers of chocolate, fudge, cheese and heaven but so amazing. Yeah so much good food and I still ended up taking half of my pizza and cheesecake home. I also got to try the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake, which was yummy as well. Although I haven't eaten many kinds of cheesecake I haven't liked.  Overall, a pleasant lunch. And you must save room for their cheesecake. But probably only good for special events or an occasional lunch because it'll make a small dent in your wallet and a small bulge in your tummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=760

Things I love getting: 1. Avocado Egg Rolls (appetizer): If you love avocado and a zesty, tasty sauce, with a nice crunch this appetizer is for you 2. Chicken & Biscuits: This was something incredibly surprising for me, usually people don't think to order this dish at The Cheesecake Factory but it's everything you dream about when you think (southern comfort). Give it a try! 3. Burgers and Smoothies 4. Cheesecake: There's just a long list of amazing cheesecakes but my top two choices have always been the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake. Bread is refillable and drinks can be taken to-go. Make sure you make a reservation if you've got a big party, or you will probably have to wait a while.

It comes with a special sauce to dip with, but there's only 6! :( wish they gave more, but it's just an appetizer so I guess it's ok haha I've also tried the fried zucchini, portobello mushroom, and avocado. This is also really good! It comes with 2 types of sauce with complements the fried goods.  Entree: my favorite dish here is the Louisiana chicken pasta hands down! It's a bow tie pasta with a delicious sauce and crispy chicken! The chicken pieces are huge too! I usually eat half and save the other half for tomorrow or share with someone. Some other dishes I like is their miso salmon, chicken Bellagio, shrimp scampi, and their luau salad!  Dessert: cheesecake is a must! They have so many different kinds and they're all good!

During my high school years was when they opened (10+ years now) I never cared for their food because I never knew what to order. I always stuck with the same food. It wasn't only until recently I started trying out some new dishes like the Chicken Madeira, Pasta DiVinci (along with all the other flavorful pastas they have) , and the most appealing dish to me was their Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo. I've never had gumbo before (I've only heard about on TV shows) so I thought I'd give it a try. And the minute I tasted a few bites I fell in love. Their Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo is extremely flavorful, so full of different spices all mixed together in a thick, soupy texture mixed with rice that gets your mouth watering with every bite you take. I'll definitely be coming back for more of that Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo for sure! However, it is on the little more spicy side, so if u can't handle mild spicy, I suggest u ask the server to make it less to non-spicy.

Parking lot was empty so we had a choice in where to park. There was no wait in line and the staff members were very friendly. The ambiance is casual with TVs for entertainment. The menu is the same so just flip to the Sunday brunch menu right before the dessert page. I felt like pasta so the server recommended the Jambalaya served with shrimp and chicken. I also tried the Factory Huevos Rancheros and the lemon-ricotta pancakes. The Rancheros were delicious especially with the soft flavorful black beans and all the condiments layered on top. The lemon-ricotta pancakes were good since it wasn't too dense or tart. The Jambalaya gave a kick of spiciness so I enjoyed it. It's just really filling with it's large portion. We finished off with a birthday sundae and a pumpkin cheesecake. The sundae was ordinary but I liked it because it was chocolate. The pumpkin cheesecake tasted like a creamy version of a pumpkin pie without the crust. It was just something I had to get for the holiday season. My favorites so far would be the steak Diane and the shrimp scampi. They taste great although I haven't tried most of the items on the menu. I really enjoyed the bruschetta before they took it out.

Jeff T.,"Alhambra, CA",241,388,2015,3.0,4/17/2016,"It has its pros and cons.  To start, this location is particularly busy, being part of the Santa Anita Mall.  The wait can get pretty crazy, but they have those buzzer things they give you to let you know when your table is ready.  Restaurant ambience is pretty nice and dim, but not sure if its date night material, considering the sheer volume of people and loudness.  Good for group events though. The bread they start you off with is amazingly addictive; at least the brown bread is.  If you're not careful, this can end up being your entire meal.  This last time I went, I shared the factory combo of the Steak Diane + Salmon (served with mashed potatoes) and a small-dish beet salad w/goat cheese.  I asked for medium-rare for the Steak Diane and it came in more of a rare/med-rare, which I wouldn't normally mind, but it was a bit too chewy and tough.  More of a preference thing, but the mashed potatoes were a bit too chunky for me.  The herb-crusted salmon was fine though.  Lastly, the beet salad was delicious, but we just wished they had a large plate option.  I wasn't a huge fan of the combo meal, but would recommend the Chicken Bellagio w/Pesto Pasta instead.  If you happen to be on a diet or watching what you eat, they do have a ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  Everything outside of this will easily break your calorie budget.  Would recommend if you've just finished shopping and don't have the energy to go elsewhere, but there's also Woodranch next door if you're more of a bbq type.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=120

When we first arrived, the hostess ignored us for a good 5 minutes before someone else came up to us to help us put our name down. She had her head down the whole time and when I tried talking to her, she just ignored me. I understand she may have been busy but she could've at least acknowledged us.  When we were seated, I was shocked to see that they had placed new utensils and plates onto  the table but the table was still littered with bread crumbs and food leftover from the previous party. My ""clean"" napkin had green stains on it and my mom's ""clean"" knife had food stuck to it. We told our waitress shortly after we were seated but no one came to wipe our table down until shortly before our food arrived. Even after reminding the waitress about my dirty napkin and the stained knife twice, we didn't receive them until after the third request much after our food arrived.   After we finished our dishes, we were considering ordering a cheesecake to end the meal. However, our waitress just dropped off our check and walked away. That was our sign that our dinner was over before we were ready for it to end. I was shocked that they did not ask if we wanted to see the dessert menu or asked if we wanted anything else considering this restaurant is known for their cheesecakes. Similarly, the same thing happened to the table next to us.  I'm typically a fan of the Cheesecake Factory but this was by far the worst service I've ever had at any location. Now I know to go to a different location instead. If you want to order cheesecake at this location, it seems like it's better to order it to-go since they don't seem to want to offer it to their dine-in customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=100
Kim K.,"Burbank, CA",146,575,3293,4.0,1/20/2016,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, so when my friends insist in Cheesecake Factory,  my heart (or maybe my stomach) sinks a little.  But I was quite surprised at this location. The staff was very friendly. Our server must have visited us 6 times before we were ready to order (and still we were a little indecisive).  She went over the specials again and we have her a couple of our choices and asked,  ""Which would you pick""  lol.  She gave us a little run down in each choice, ultimately making it our decision and that was great.  She even brought me a small sample of the chicken tortilla soup, add I was in the fence about it. It was really good. And yes, that's what I ended up ordering.  Our drinks were always filled,  plates swept away, and dessert options announced. Mmmmm desserts. Wait! Mmmm CHEESECAKE!  Yes I know we are at the Cheesecake Factory. Yes I know I'm going to want cheesecake. Why why why do I fill up on the free bread?  Oh yea because it's warm and delicious. So, nope... no room for the yummy cheesecake. And averaging the cost of a small meal,  my check book says that was good of me.  I would love to see this place add small small bite size desserts to their meal. That gives people the sweet taste after a meal and makes them want to bring home a slice or whole pie. I just dint get why more places haven't re adopted this way of eating. Courses!  I think that's why I eat at home so often.  I want a small salad or soup and a small meal and a taste of sweet. But not so I can bring home a bunch of leftovers that won't get eaten and not a bill that costs $30 for one person's lunch. I'm just saying.  But overall we really enjoyed this place! The servers were great. The bathrooms were clean. There's plenty of parking. And the mall is right there to walk off that meal right after.

This time around we were seated right away, there was no wait time. Maria was our server. She started off by mixing our drinks up. I ordered a cherry coke and my Husband ordered a Diet coke. I received a regular coke and he ended up with a Cherry Diet Coke.  After we ordered we received everything but my husbands Salad which our waitress forgot about. I don't know if she was flustered from getting our drinks wrong and just forgot? Either way my husband wasn't satisfied with his small shrimp, mashed potato and steak dish. He received I think 3 cut up tiny pieces of steak, and 3 shrimp were on the plate. Even I was disappointed and I didn't have to eat it. It was an over priced dish for sure! I ordered the pork chop dish again and this time it didn't seem to have the same delicious taste as last time.  After our mishap with Maria I will say this, She was super attentive to us in regards to refills and kept checking in on us a lot which I sincerely appreciated!! She was still great regardless of the mess ups. While we were eating a employee brought a side of fries and dropped them off at our table. Now we didn't order that or were expecting it but found out the table next to us was. That was awkward for all of us.

We loved everything we had and everything felt like it was freshly chopped, cooked, and fried. The food was on point. Deducting 1 star for our server. He was great when he was present at our table.

Jenny K.,"Los Angeles, CA",946,1248,244,4.0,6/5/2016,"*** Well-run, beloved chain. Consistency is key *** Cheesecake Factory is an oldie but a goodie. I have ordered the same favorite dish for decades...LOL. the thing about that is that i used to try new dishes when i visited, but it left me wishing i had just ordered my fave. CHICKEN MADEIRA - thin chicken breast with madeira sauce, mushrooms, cheese, asparagus with mashed potatoes. Mmm... i usually split the chicken madeira since CF portion size is generous. for those who say that CF is expensive, they probably don't share an entree. if i order the chicken madeira myself, i would have to box half of it up. if you don't, that is why america is obese.  food comes out in a timely manner. this is one of the biggest reasons i go there, besides the food. when you have such a well-run chain, you get efficiency. also, my fave appetizer are the avocado eggrolls. they are premade. they have cilantro which is highly dislike...but this is still my favorite appetizer. what does that tell you? ha.  i've had the eggroll platter, the one where you get 4 different kinds of eggrolls, but that was overwhelming. would be good to share if you had more people with you. their salads are huge. you can't go wrong with most of the menu.  however, i must say that the most disappointing thing i have ever ordered was the soup. way too salty. i couldn't take more than two spoonfuls. i never get to eating cheesecake but if i were to recommend one, it would be the vanilla bean. i had it at a party...best cheesecake ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=100

So... only our order gets delayed, out of 4 other tables seated after us?  *new update Two tables have finished and left already. So from our server he came and informed us (@ the 20 min mark) that they had a chef in training. As we neared the 50 minute mark he informed us that he would get a manager to speak to us.  A manager walked by just asking table to table how things were and was unaware of the situation. So we explained to him what has happened so far. He said he would look into it. He comes back 5 minutes later and says it is the servers fault and we shouldn't have to endure this. I am just thinking, why are you stating the obvious? He goes on to say, for your trouble we can give you a slice of cheese cake on the house... seriously? You ruined dinner, made us wait, made excuses and all you could do was offer a slice of cheesecake for two people?

Kinesha S.,"Alhambra, CA",2,32,13,1.0,12/12/2016,"My husband and I went here on a Sunday night. It didn't take too long to get seated. It was moderately busy, so that was great. We were seated right before the two people at a table next to us. My husband immediately noticed the table was dirty and proceeded to clean it, before I sat down. After sitting, I noticed my small plate was dirty. My husband gave me his, but that one also had food on it. When the table next to us sat down, immediately the server, Christopher, greeted them and took their drink orders. We still waited for Christopher to come to our table. The table next to us got their drinks and bread, yet my husband and I were still waiting. Finally, Christopher came to our table. We told him about the dirty dishes and he just said ""uh-oh."" Christopher takes our drink orders and then took the meal order for the table next to us. After awhile, he brings water that we didn't ask for. And we wait...the table next to us get their food and we're still waiting for our drinks and bread.  Christopher finally brings the drinks and bread. He left then came back and dropped off plates. Another 10 minutes goes by or so and he takes our order. After another long wait, my husband gets his appetizer. After that, we saw Christopher pass by a couple of times and yell out something like still waiting, without even stopping at our table. After the table next to us are done eating, he immediately took their plates away and joked with them. He then came back and gave them their check. The table left. That was it! I went to the hostess stand to find three employees chatting with each other as I stood there. I called out excuse me loudly and asked for the manager. They quickly dispersed and one went to find the manager.  The manager, Shannon, came out and I told her about my horrible experience and still no food. She quickly apologized and said she would check on the order and comp the entrees. I went back to my table and the table next to us have already left. Shortly after, Christopher comes over and asks if we want more bread and apologized for the wait. Completely fake! He didn't care. Shannon came over and again apologized and offered us a drink and we declined stating that we just wanted our food.  The food finally comes and Christopher haphazardly thanked us for our patience. The food was great. After we paid, Shannon came over again and asked if we wanted dessert to take with us on them and we declined. As we left, no one at the hostess stand said anything to us. The restaurant was pretty empty by then. Earlier, I had noticed the hostesses excitedly wishing leaving patrons a good night and thanking them for coming in.  I know this place has the worse reviews, but I had never been treated so badly there. Christopher not only serviced someone who sat down after us so quickly, but he didn't even care about how he wasted our time. Time is something we will not get back. We don't need food compensated. We have money to pay for what we want. I just don't understand why we were treated like that. And I would hate to think about ethnicity. Christopher is black and so am I. The table next to us were Hispanic. My husband is white. All of this shouldn't matter and hope it didn't matter to Christopher. However, I do hope he's now looking for another job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=100

The dark wheat bread that they give you is so good! I always ask for a second basket because I basically inhale that bread... mmmmmmm... Anyway, my friend JC who is the reason why I love Cheesecake Factory yelled at me when she found out I ordered steak here.

Here's what we got: Ahi Tartare - pretty good, lots of avacado, the fried wontons strips were overly oily, not the freshest tuna but what do you expect from a chain restaurant. It was a small portion, good for two people.  Fried Zucchini - pretty typical. They used the perfect amount of oil to get a nice crispy outside and juicy inside. Tossed Garden Salad - large size for an appetizer. We got basamic dressing and it was great! The croutons were super hard though. I would suggest skipping yhe croutons. Bang-bang chicken - terrible! The description said... Spicy. But it was not at all spicy. It was super sweet with dried coconut on top. They need to go light on the coconut. It was way to sweet.

Emily C.,"Culver City, CA",446,252,228,3.0,6/10/2014,"I'd recommend coming for the lunch specials or happy hour (Mon - Fri: 4 - 6pm) Parking: On the weekends, the mall is always super packed and it's tough to find parking, especially in the shaded areas. I usually have to circle the lot a good 5-10 minutes before actually finding parking. Service: I usually experience pretty good service at Cheesecake Factory. The staff is always friendly and helpful, although they may not be attentive when you need them. Sometimes, the food isn't cooked to my liking, and they're always willing to remake it (I'm hoping no one has ever spat in my food). Food: My favorite thing to order here is the Ahi Tartare small bites. The tuna is probably not the freshest, but with the avocados and sauce, it really doesn't matter. Next favorite is the avocado eggrolls. The tamarind salsa is so yummy that we always ask for an extra. Also, there is so much avocado inside! Try to catch happy hour so that you can get the avocado eggrolls for $5 (normally $10)! As for the entree, I normally order the Pasta da Vinci. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but I enjoy the pasta. Sometimes, it's made too salty for me, so it just depends on the day - some days are good while others are not. For lunch, I like to also order the Pizza & Salad combo. I think it's a pretty good deal for the amount of food you get, but the size of the pizza might have gotten smaller. I am not a fan of their other pastas/entrees. Make sure to save room for dessert! You can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not try one of their cheesecakes! Most of the chocolate based cakes are too rich and heavy for me. My favorite cheesecake is Vanilla Bean, Original, and the Tiramisu. The Vanilla Bean is my all-time favorite and is probably the only one I can finish an entire order of without feeling sick. It's not too sweet and is delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=280

Anyways let me tell you he was great took a lil longer then usual to get our drinks but he was on it for everything else. I'm a General Manager for a restaurant so i know everything about serving and he did an amazing job. 5 stars for Abraham!!! Now the only reason why i have the store a 4 star when they needed a 5 star because of Abrahams great service is that the Restroom needed a major cleaning. As i walked in the trash was full to the max with paper towels in the grown both stalls did not have toilet paper, i just walked in and walked back out when i saw no toilet paper.

Certainly didn't deduct it from my bill.  I know that's just one plate of food at one Cheesecake Factory, but I see that whole anecdote as an example of the entire Cheesecake Factory system. Which is: A customer comes in wanting a shovel of food, and the staff is eager to put whatever they want on that shovel. Presentation isn't important. Not even taste. It's just calories go in, money goes out. This is why it is called Cheesecake FACTORY and not Cheesecake RESTAURANT.  If what you're looking for in a meal is high efficiency and minimal shame from the wait staff, CF is your jam.

In honor of Administrative Professional Day (04.22.15), I got a gift card from my Boss and took my Mom out for an early Mommy Daughter birthday lunch. It was pretty cool that lunch here is served until 5pm and so we took advantage of that. It's been a while since we've eaten here and so we had an Italian lunch. We got the following items: Full size Everything Pizza with Salad: Mom and I loved the pizza and it was delicious.  Wasn't too spicy or peppery and Mom gulped down half of her pizza slices. Usually, she's not much of a pizza fan, but this one she digged. It had the small pepperonis, sausage, mushrooms and red onions. Topped with a generous shaving of parmesan cheese. The salad was fresh and plentiful with arugula and radicchio and the dressing with tangy and sweet also with a generous shaving of parmesan cheese.  The chicken piccatta: the chicken steak was pound out thinly and with creamy sauce and spaghetti and a generous shaving of parmesan cheese. The spaghetti was soft and Al dente. Though Mom wasn't a fan of this one since there wasn't even sauce to mix the spaghetti with. I didn't mind this one and it made for a nice lunch to take to work tomorrow.  The avocado eggrolls: soft creamy avocados rolled into an egg roll and I dug it. Mom being the eggrolls making Queen giggle at this American creation, but she actually liked it as well. We both ate 3 each and saved two for me to take to lunch tomorrow. I loved the dipping sauce too - sweet pesto basil sauce, yum! Finally, the crew sang Happy Birthday to my mom with a cheesecake slice. (The cheesecake was light and creamy and mixed with chocolate sauce and whipped cream...O.M.G..yum!!!). Mom was blushing, but giggle and enjoyed the finale, lol! Service with Mickey was friendly and attentive and he packed up our leftovers for us.

Dianne L.,"Tacoma, WA",1,17,6,5.0,3/9/2016,"We were here for dinner on a Tuesday night, so we didn't have to wait long to be seated. On a weekend,however; you would have to wait in crowded lobby with customers who are there to just pick up cheesecakes, customers for carryout and servers who are trying to carry food to customers at the bar. It's chaos to wait, plus there are limited seating (one bench). I suggest waiting outside or take short walk in the mall.  Food is always CONSISTENTLY amazing. Generous portions. My son and husband always order the bacon avocado burger that they called heaven. My daughter and I shared the chicken Bellagio, that is also served with pancetta and arugula salad. They ran out of arugula but it still tasted fabulous. We had the world best waiter, Cody OMG superb manner, he got down to eye level with my kids to take their orders.

Ivana D.,"Rosemead, CA",284,68,233,5.0,1/3/2018,"I actually love this place! Though probably explains why the line at night is so long! Portion sizes are huge as well so you can definitely share or take home left overs!  First to start off with the bread, I love the brown bread that I usually just ask for that one especially when it's freshly warm and the butter gets all melting into it..yuum. Some of my choices to get would be the factory combination of the steak diane(?) and herb crusted salmon. The steak is a little on the sweeter side, it comes with mushrooms and mashed potato in the middle separating it from the creamy sauce for the moist salmon. It comes with some asparagus which goes great with the sauce. I like both side sauces actually but the creamy one for the salmon is addicting! So addicting sometimes, I just get the herb crusted salmon by itself. Another option I absolutely love is the Louisiana chicken pasta! The sauce is creamy, a hint of spicy, with some flavorable veggies like bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms. This comes with bow tie pasta, my favorite pasta. The chicken is breaded and fried, so its a bit crunchy but still moist. Also, you can add as much freshly grated parmesan cheese as you want! The sauce is so good, I like practically clean the plate squeaky clean. I never really tried other cheesecakes but I usually go with their most popular if I'm in the mood. Which is the ultimate red velvet cheesecake. Some days its not so good, other days it's the best thing ever. So I think this is the only thing that isn't always consistent, food wise.  Same goes for service, sometimes the service is amazing, other days, maybe not as good? It's still decent though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia
Alvin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,153,133,2.0,1/10/2018,"I'm only giving this restaurant one star for service and another for the bread.  Came here on a weekend for dinner with a group of 6 and because they don't take reservations, we wound up waiting in line like everyone else for nearly an hour and a half to be seated. You line up and make your way through hoards of people waiting inside to put your name down and grab one of those buzzers. There's no fancy text messaging system to alert you to return when your name is about to be called. I expected some wait during the weekend but we were finally seated after 90 minutes.  Your experience with service here will vary depending on who you're paired with but our server was cute in an awkward kind of way. He made sure we were well stocked with delicious brown bread and sourdough bread with butter while we waited for our food. And this is where the positives end. Eating at the Cheesecake Factory is not cheap, and while I hate the idea of eating at chain restaurants, my girlfriend really loves the strawberry shortcake here and we decided to bring the family along. At close to 15-20 dollars a dish, you expect to have some decent quality to the food. I'm not sure if the chefs were particularly burnt out this evening but all of our dishes came out terrible and almost inedible. Shrimp Scampi - bland overcooked pasta with a scattering of limp shrimp drenched in butter and lemon juice. If they had kept this al dente, it may have been okay. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - overly sweet and rich coconut sauce was overpowering and the hints of ginger made this an entree that looked like a sad attempt at thai fusion curry. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - overcooked green pasta with no sauce. It tasted like someone had left the pasta boiling in the water 10 minutes too long and washed out the sauce after realizing that it wasn't clinging onto the noodles. Tasted a lot like mealy carbs with cajun seasoning sprinkled on and not much else. Miso Salmon - the one acceptable dish but it came out overly sweet today and my parents didn't care for it. Thai Coconut Lime Chicken - ordered this as it was on their list of new items and I'm a huge fan of thai food. This was more palatable than the overly sweet bang bang chicken but the sauce was way too strong, and again tasted like syrup and coconut milk poured atop coconut flavored rice.  Smokehouse burger - bun was burnt to a crisp and extra smoky. 'nuff said. Those in the kitchen seem to have given up. Quality control between the various Cheescake factories needs work in order to demonstrate to customers that their food is of good value. When you're paying north of 20 dollars per person for food after taxes, it is quite sad when the star dish of the day was the complimentary bread served before the main courses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia

Brian L.,"Orange, CA",243,120,35,3.0,1/2/2018,"Came here for dinner on New Year's Eve and the wait was almost an hour. So if you want Cheesecake Factory, especially this location, and don't want a long wait. Avoid the holidays. This location is one of the more bougie and grand than some other ones. The staff is nice and friendly and the food is decent. One of the best things about this place is that serving sizes are fairly large. However, I would stay away from their combination options if you're hungry. My farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic was great and I was able to have some leftovers even after sharing with another person. Definitely try one of their cheesecakes because hello... Cheesecake Factory. Can't go wrong with any choice, but you can always ask your waiter for recommendations. My party actually ended up sharing a tiramisu cake, which wasn't bad but they put a ton of whipped cream so that was meh. Their cocktails/mixed drinks are pretty good as well. Their passion fruit mojito and Georgia peach are great, but will cost you a pretty penny. Their moscato is a great alternative and is more cost effective. My only complaints about this place are that my party had to wait an extra 15 minutes because the hostess at the counter put me down as a party of 2 when I actually had 3. And the waiter we had was here and there and would disappear for some time while his tables needed him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia
Maggie O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,4,2.0,12/24/2017,"Food was great, but this is regarding my order.  So i ordered on the phone since we decided to have a holiday dinner at home. I ordered the chargrilled ny steak with mashed potatoes and french fries, all GF. The guy who took my order repeated it as GF. When i went to go pick it up,  1) my steak had no fries 2) they forgot to give me my $9 cake I had notified the lady and she put the fries order in for me but she checked with her manager(?) to see if they can do French Fries GF, in which they said they dont. That was a surprise and very odd to me because ive been gluten free for almost 2years and everytime i dined in or ordered take out, they confirmed that it was GF and ive never had a reaction. The manager(?) told me that they dont do GF for french fries but they can use the fryer they didnt usr much. I said okay, and they asked me if i wanted sweet potato fries or french fries, I said French Fries. He said okay and put the order in. While waiting i finally got my cake and about 10min i go my fries. I didnt even check because i thought they would be fries but when i got back home and check, it turned out to be sweet potato fries. On the menu the sweet potato fries is not listed as the ""GF upon requested"" so i ended up not eating it to be on the safe side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia
Anna B.,"Glendora, CA",44,130,84,4.0,10/8/2017,"I dined here for lunch around noon on a Saturday. My friend and I chose to sit in the outside patio area. Our server, Mercedes, provided fantastic table service by ensuring that our bread basket was always filled and promptly packaging up the leftovers from our meal. We browsed the cocktail and wine menu, settling on a glass of Chapoutier Rosé wine for me (my first time trying this specific wine and loved the light yet crisp flavor elements) and a Red Sangria for my friend.  Next, we shared the guacamole and chips appetizer (also includes condiment-sized cups of salsa and sour cream), which is priced at $12.50, but overlooking the steep price since the guacamole was THAT GOOD for standard American fare. For our main entrée, we shared the Bistro Shrimp Pasta (pasta portions are ample here, so I suggest sharing if you can't finish a whole plate of pasta by yourself) and an appetizer side salad; a tossed green salad that we asked to have two different dressings with: bleu cheese and ranch. The salad was exceptional for a regular green salad, since the lettuce selection wasn't iceberg lettuce heaped together, but actual green leaf lettuce freshly chopped. The pasta dish was wonderful, however the crispy battered shrimp was great tasting, but not my favorite kind of shrimp since I usually prefer my shrimp pasta dishes to have sautéed shrimp instead of fried. Therefore, if I order this pasta another time, I will choose to swap in sautéed shrimp instead of the former, because that basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce on the pasta was delightful! Although quite pricier compared to other restaurant chains, this Cheesecake Factory location delivers splendid customer service and cooks up consistently delectable pasta dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia
Janny K.,"San Gabriel, CA",177,75,263,5.0,12/11/2017,"This is probably one of my favorite local restaurant! I come here pretty often especially during lunch time. I do enjoy getting their appetizers. I like the chicken sliders, avocado egg rolls which is deep fried, Factory nachos are really good and loaded with everything, macaroni balls are delicious, the side salad is okay and comes in a huge portion, the sweet tamale is very delicious (I don't know where I can this type of fusion) , spinach dip is delicious and not too oily/salty, and the buffalo wings is amazing because it's crunchy. They also have happy hour which is half off on selected appetizers. Entrees of pretty delicious: I have tried the salmon steak which is wonderful and good. It's not too dry.  My favorite is. Pasta Da Vinci. It's a sweet oily taste. Comes with loaded mushrooms, onions and garlic. Penne pasta. I love the hint of wine along with such delicious chicken. I will definitely order this again and again.  My bf had the four cheese pasta and it's definitely cheesy if that's how you I like your pasta. It's really good according to him until his cheese turned cold haha and it also comes with chicken with a spoonful of more cheese in the center.  Love their fresh squeezed orange juice.  Their mojito is delicious and refreshing. I usually get this during the day along with my appetizers. Love the mint leaves  Before I had diabetes (2017), I always get their strawberry cheesecake!! It's the best! And I would order one for here and one to go haha.  Most of all, I love the experience here. Wonderful customer service, all the waiters are really super nice except what they are super busy during happy hours. They take forever to serve you but if you come on non happy hours you would definitely leave happy. Everyone is very polite and very quick at their service.

This location is in the Santa Anita Mall in Arcadia, CA, which is convenient! You can burn all those calories you stuffed your face with by walking around the mall after! I usually order my favorite farfalle pasta! It's a bowtie pasta with a garlic creamy sauce, chicken, and mushrooms! I am obsessed with garlic, so I can definitely taste the garlic with my pasta. The chicken with the pasta is also extremely good! It isn't dry and the sauce goes well with it.  The chicken madeira is also a huge win for me! It's a sliced piece of chicken breast, with the madeira sauce! It is soooooo good. The sauce is addicting! It's this wine/mushroom sauce. It went perfect with the chicken and mashed potatoes it came with! Another plate we enjoy ordering, is the avocado egg rolls! My mom loves the sauce it comes with. It's this sweet, cilantro-ish sauce, which is quite flavorful. I just love the avocado rolls by itself! It literally just tastes like you are eating huge chunks of avocados wrapped in a fried blanket of carbs!  I rarely come to cheesecake factory because of the prices. I feel like with the prices of the items on the menu is a little high! There are definitely chain restaurants that are more affordable.

Julie P.,"Pasadena, CA",1342,264,1092,4.0,8/28/2017,"I have been meaning to write a great review for this place. I have been coming to this place for few years now. This is a chain restaurant ,so many of us are familiar with this place. However, the location and staff make all the different. Location: At Santa Anita Mall in the back  by AMC movie theater/Food Court Parking: free or you can get valet in right next to the restaurant Decoration: Modern furniture. It has inside and outside dining area. You also have a bar area for happy hour. You don't need reservation to sit in this area. Outside area also have heat lamp for cold nights Service: Service oriented restaurant. People appear happy and ready to do a great job Food: I got the Fried Macaroni and Cheese. It was melt to your mouth with  crispy cheese ball and you dipped in creamy marinara sauce (delicious). I got the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta. It was sautéed perfectly with tender chicken and top with fresh basil in Rigatoni pasta Price: $13-20. It is reasonable for the amount of food you can. You can also ask for lunch or dinner portion. If you are into portion control Dessert Menu: Tiramisu,  Chocolate Tower Truffle cake, Fresh Strawberry shortcake and of course any kind of cheesecake you can think of (Ex: Fresh Strawberry, Coffee & Cream Chocolate,  Salted Caramel, Toasted Marshmallow S'Mores , Oreo Dream, Lemon Meringue, Peanut Butter Cup Fudge, Red Velvet, White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle, Dulce De Leche Caramel). I can go on and on about their mouth watering desserts that  will clogged all your arteries. However, you will die happy. They have Sunday Brunch  from 10-2pm If you are into dieting, this is probably not the place for you. Their food are in high calories and it is written write next to the name of the dish. You will feel bad for eating it. I tried to be good by getting their skinnlicious menu, but the calories are still fairly high. However, I believed you only live once, so enjoy life vs worry all the time about how you look. Enjoy!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia

I've been going to this Cheesecake Factory for years now (I used to work at the mall, so it was my go to)-- but after what happened last night (NYE), not anymore. So I want to start out by saying that I went yesterday because I had a gift card, and it was New Year's Eve. It was packed, as predicted but nonetheless my boyfriend and I opted to sit outside so it was only a 5 minute wait. We had the waitress Melissa (I think) red hair in a ponytail, she was wonderful; this review is solely on the food not the service. The service was awesome to say the least. Anyway, my boyfriend ordered the Pasta Nepolatana and I ordered my usual Carbonara no chicken. So the food came out fairly quickly, and tasted good. But further into the night I started to feel super queasy. It was New Year's Eve there's no way I could've got food poisoning right? WRONG! I spent my entire night throwing up and on the toilet, I'm writing this review as we speak because I'm still experiencing the same!! HORRIBLE! Worst food poisoning I have EVER gotten, I can't even keep warm water down!! On the other hand, my boyfriend ate some of my pasta he was feeling alright up until this morning, he has been in the restroom ever since! I'm so upset, what a great way to start my New Years!

The last time I came here was to celebrate an early father's day. Location/Parking: Located at the Santa Anita Mall. You'll find this restaurant next to Wood Ranch BBQ and Grill. Parking can be a bit troublesome during peak times. Ambiance/Decor: Nice ambiance with modern furnishings and a outdoor patio to people watch. They also have heatlamps just in case it gets chilly willy! Wait time: You might wait for awhile during peak times. So call ahead and make a reservation. Service: Service was fairly consistent. Staffers were friendly and attentive. Food usually takes awhile, because they usually bring all the food all at once. Food: They mostly offer high calorie (1,000+ cal.) dishes. If you're calorie counting, don't get scared off. They do offer a skinnylicious extensive menu for all you healthy peeps. Over the years, I've tried a lot of items, but my top 3 plates that I rotate (creature of habit) through are: 1) Meatloaf: Comes with mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy, grilled onions, and corn succotash. Meatloaf lovers will definitely love this dish. Very moist and very flavorful! Mushroom gravy, grilled onions, and corn succotash is the cherry topper for me.  2) Miso Salmon: Comes with snow peas, rice (white or brown), and topped with a miso sauce. Very yum! I'm a salmon lover and this one is tender and flavorful. The sauce is beautiful! :)  3) Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken: Comes with mashed potatoes, carrots, and watercress.The chicken is flavorful, tender, and beautiful!!! I also like eating the skin!

Legitimately 10 minutes after taking our orders she walked over to ask us what we ordered because she ""couldn't read her writing"". While we were waiting for our food, we asked our server TWICE to bring us straws and to refill our waters. Our food didn't come out until 30 minutes later.  Our server never checked on us to see if everything was okay nor to refill our waters.

This place has great food and good service. The servers tend to you and makes sure you're enjoying your brunch, lunch and dinner. Recently, I came here with my girlfriend to catch up and updating me on her wedding plans for a nice day out for brunch. When we walk in, we were immediately welcomed and were seated in less than 5 minutes with outdoor seating due to the nice warm weather on December. My girlfriend, Brittany, ordered the lemon-ricotta pancakes with fresh strawberries with coffee and I ordered an eggs benedict with Canadian bacon, hollandaise sauce and hash browns with a glass of mimosa. Awesome brunch with my best friend.  Only thing I'll take away from this was that my girlfriend didn't much like her pancakes cause it wasn't lemony enough and knowing Sundays are family days, parking will be bad whether you self parked or chose to do valet, it's horrible parking no matter what. Other than that, great place to eat some delicious food. Everything on their menu is good, especially their baked salmon and spinach. One last thing, their complimentary breads are so yummy! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=380
Eli S.,"Monterey Park, CA",49,100,127,5.0,10/29/2014,"Best service that I've had in a long time, the food was very good and the waiter I had was very attentive to our needs.  So much that I even asked to speak to the manager so I could express my gratitude. We also took a cheesecake home with us and I will certainly return. Needless to say, we tipped around 28% of the meal cost, my theory is that my server has earned 20% even before I sit down, they can lose that or gain more as we go.

O W.,"Corona, CA",27,176,34,3.0,12/2/2014,"Came to the Cheesecake Factory on a rainy Tuesday with my mom.  The hostess at the front was helpful and friendly. A waitress started to lead us to our table, but then, for some reason, she ended up walking away without giving us a table... So I turned to one of the waiters and asked about our seating, and he gave me a mean look and said ""-__- go to the front."" I was a little bit surprised, because usually Cheesecake Factory servers are really friendly, but we all have bad days... So my mom and I, both of us a little bit pissed off, went back to the front to again ask for a seat. We were instantly given a table by another friendly host and our waiter was Cody. Cody was friendly, helpful and attentive. He frequently came back to check up on us.  Good portion sizes, but the food was a little bland. The spaghetti and meatballs tasted like something out of a can, or maybe my taste buds have just been spoiled by Di Pillas (so good!! if you're in the SGV area I highly recommend Di Pillas)  Waiters and waitresses are friendly but it's hard to get their attention sometimes because they're so rushed.

However three times have I experienced waiting for my food for an average of 40 minutes. Once we waited for a whole hour until the bartender called the manager to wait on us (table for 2). The last time I was here (was a Tuesday evening)  I waited for more than 30 minutes. We decided to leave so we went to pay for the coffee and appetizer and was told that the food was ready but wasn't served for some reason.

It was national cheesecake day tho so that's why it was prolly super packed. Just come for the cheesecake, don't even bother getting a food dish!

Christine C.,"Bellevue, WA",198,260,536,1.0,7/28/2015,"In preparation for our large 12 person party, I called the day before to make reservations.  They do not take them.  Ok, so I ask the hostess at the time if Sundays were particularly busy for lunch bc that's when we would come.  She told me to have my party come by noon to ensure the shortest wait time as our desired 1:30pm slot would be way too late for such a large party.  Ok, no problem. Sunday rolls around and we all get there by noon and our name is placed.  The wait was quoted at 1 hour 15 minutes!!  I knew we were gonna wait and that the tip to come early really depends on the day of situation... but wow that was super long! In the end, we waited a whopping 1 hour 45 minutes!!!  We had several young kids and they were not happy (and when they are not happy, they are not sitting still!!).  We asked for bread for them, which the least they could do.  Finally, we get seated and the server was great a little slow but we were a big party.  Food still took an hour to get out to us though!  Must've been slow and lazy Sunday for everyone working bc things were def lagging!  We got an array of foods ranging in the menu from brunch, lunch specials, regular entrees, burgers, and breakfast items.  Nothing really stood out as far as taste and flavor, but maybe we just waited too long for food that we just did not care anymore. I got the Renee's special and the soup du jour was Chicken Artichoke.... there were NO other choices!  So, I was stuck with that... UGH  had I known that, I probably would've chosen another dish but after waiting 2 hours to be seated then to order, I just wanted to EAT! Overall, the food was just ok, not as good as I remembered it to be during dinner hours.  They were crazy busy so could be the reason why.  Service was good, not the best but not the worst either.  For a large restaurant like Cheesecake Factory, I would want to see them accommodate larger parties easier.  There were a few large parties that I saw waiting after us and a couple of parties seated before us.  They get large parties, they just don't know how to handle it.  The hostess was the worst bc she was quite unprofessional.  When I inquired after waiting 45 mins for a table, she said she would get the manager to help us but she never did.  Then, she tells my brother that our WHOLE party had to wait in that little waiting area in order for us to wait for our  table! WTF?  First, we have small kids who can't sit still then we also have elderly ppl who can't stand for 2 friggin hours (We sat at the food court at the mall.... ten steps away and she told us we COULD NOT!!).  Well, instead of getting a cell # to call us when our table was ready, they should have given us a restaurant pager like what everyone else got.... Oh, it was my sister's birthday and I thought they could have at least given her a free slice of cake for all the ish we had to go through with them.... she still got fudge and whipped cream... oh well..

Cindy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",181,774,55,4.0,9/15/2012,"Happy Hour! Mon - Fri: 4-6pm @ the bar area I love Cheesecake Factory's Happy Hour! They have plenty of delicious appetizer-y food choices in prices ranging from $5-$7. You can literally fill up for $10!  My favorite has always been the avocado eggrolls ($5 for 6 pieces - what a steal!) & I also tried their Mushroom flatbread pizza ($5.95). Even at the bar, you are served their complimentary bread & can order off the main menu if you like. Other offerings off their HH menu include: sliders, salads, flatbreads, and all sorts of other goodies from their main appetizer menus at a discounted price. They also offer $5 cocktails & wine/draft beer as well.  During non happy hour (when I'm grabbing a bite with friends), my default order is the Pasta Da Vinci.

Free bread is always nice, and the waiters are always nice enough to bring more if I run out (yay take home free bread, the wheat bread is better btw) They recently redid their burger menus (now ""glamburgers"") and the mushroom and swiss burger is pretty tasty. Honestly when I come I usually get a burger because it is cheaper and tastes good, simple as that. Other good choices are the chicken bellagio, chicken marsala, and garlic noodles. Usually leave with a good portion of leftovers so that's always a plus. Also, if you are ever planning on coming here and watching your weight, get the low carb cheesecake!

Sadly no one makes eye contact or acknowledges you to say just a couple of minutes or something.  You wait the wait and the bread is warm not hot.

The first time it happened to me I complained about it and they got me a brand new plate and were very kind and genuine about it. The second time I just didn't want to bother waiting for a new plate and just dealt with it. I think they should really check up with the chefs and figure it out.

This Cheesecake Factory is SOOOOO overdone, Las Vegas style, but the servers and hostess are sooo friendly and the desserts are soooo delicious. Lucy Y. and I were only going to have a taste of something, but while Lucy was in the bathroom I ordered a third dessert just to taste. So we had red velvet cake cheesecake, pineapple upside down cheesecake and a hot fudge sundae.  Are you saying ""sugar coma"" ?  Yes, indeed, that's how we felt afterwards, even though we only ate a little of each.  I am not a red velvet cake fan but the cheesecake was just deee-licious.  Layers of red velvet cake AND cheesecake.  OMG.   The pineapple upside down cake was the best of all three desserts.  Have always been a fan of regular pineapple upside down cake, and this one was a double treat.  Chewy juicy pineapple upside down cake with a thick layer of cheesecake and a graham cracker crust.  Oh my, just the best. And how can you ruin a hot fudge sundae?  Well, I guess if you're Baskin Robbins 31 flavors you can ruin it by cutting down on the amount of chocolate you put in the fudge.  If you're the Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia, you make your own hot fudge!!!  It tasted like See's Candy melted.  I asked for a second little boatful but then we couldn't finish it all for fear of upchucking in a public place. Their decaf iced coffee was FABULOUS!  Trying to cut down on caffeine and sometimes that means cutting down on flavor, but this was super!!

It's not too hard and crispy so it feels great against your palate, unlike the sourdough one they give you. I always end up asking for at least two more baskets of the brown bread.  Whenever I go here, I usually order the same thing, which is the Spicy Chicken Chipote Pasta. If you like creamy sauces with a kick of spiciness, this dish is for you! It goes extremely well with the parmasean that they grate in front of you. If you are in the mood for something to drink besides water, the strawberry lemonade tastes great too!

Never getting it again The last time I was here it was national cheesecake day for every customer a cheesecake is half off! My man and I got a dulce de leche and a white truffle raspberry cheesecake. Both were tooooo sweet so gonna try another flavor next time.  I've also tried tiramisu cheesecake and by far it is my favorite. Service is generally good but it does do down hill in the night because of more and more people with bigger groups. I'd come back again for their healthier options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=360
Kim B.,"Temple City, CA",15,86,,3.0,7/24/2014,"We had received a gift card for the Cheesecake Factory so we decided to check it out last Friday. We had never been to this location before. As we entered we were greeted and seated right away. I liked the decor here and it's very open and spacious inside. There is also a patio for those who would prefer to eat outdoors. Our server was very nice, she even came back to our table after she was off work to check to see how we liked our food. As has been previously mentioned in other reviews, the menu here is enormous! We finally decided on the Everything Pizza , the mushroom burger, and the Cuban sandwich. All of the entrees came with a salad. The salad that came with the pizza was huge! Needless to say we ended up taking most of it boxed home with us. And of course, we did order cheesecake for dessert but had to get it to go, as our tummies were too full by the time dessert came around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=360
Jody C.,"Los Angeles, CA",487,267,1638,4.0,10/22/2013,"I really like Cheesecake Factory food. If not for the crazy crowd and long wait, I'd probably dine here more often. I like coming during the weekdays instead for lunch because it's less busy. On the weekends, it's impossible to get a table without waiting 30 min+. My favorites here are the chicken chipotle pasta, pork chop, jambalaya, and cobb salad.. I guess that's ALOT of favorites. That's because most of the items on the menu are actually quite decent.

Bianca S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",119,131,294,4.0,5/18/2017,After an annoying day of shopping at the Santa Anita mall (because it's always so crowded) we decided to stop at Cheesecake Factory and grab something to eat. We came in at about 1:30pm and it wasn't really busy but for some reason we waited almost 10 mins and still weren't seated so we decided to seat ourselves in the bar seating area. Our server took a couple minutes to come over and she took our drink order while we went over the menu. We put in an order for the avocado egg roll appetizer and they came out about 10 mins after. These egg rolls never disappointment me and I swear they get better every time.  I ordered the chicken piccata off the lunch menu. It came out about 15 mins after our appetizer. The portion was way more than enough I could barely finish it even though it was the lunch size. It's one of my favorite dishes the mushroom lemon caper sauce that comes on it is so refreshing and satisfying. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't enough sauce on it and there was way too much butter I wish there was more lemon in it today.  We somehow managed to fit in desert. We ordered the banana creme cheesecake with a side of vanilla ice cream. ONE OF THE BEST FLAVORS!!! It's almost like a creamy banana pudding and the whipped cream they used on top is so light and airy. You have to try if you haven't already!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=20
Sally L.,"Los Angeles, CA",245,171,971,4.0,5/24/2017,"One of my go-to places for a special occasion! This location is located right outside of the Santa Anita mall near the food court. It's pretty big with a lot of seating, but there can still be a wait during busy weekend dinner times. You can definitely grab a drink in the bar area while you wait. If you're into yummy cocktails, I would suggest the Strawberry Creamsicle or the Peach Bellini!  As for food, they have a ton of options ranging from pastas to pizzas to protein dishes. My favorite is the Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken. I just love the light lemon herb sauce! Also, the mashed potatoes are great because I love mine chunky. The Pasta Da Vinci is also a good choice. It has chicken, mushrooms, and a great wine sauce. They also give you free unlimited bread here that's really great. I love the ""brown bread"" which is a sweet wheat and oat brown bread that tastes like chocolate in my opinion.  And of course, you can't forget about the cheesecake. They have so many different options that it's always hard to choose. The red velvet one is really good, and so is the white chocolate raspberry truffle. Each slice is pretty hefty so I suggest splitting it with someone. Overall, Cheesecake Factory might be a bit pricey (~$15-20 per dish), but the food tastes great and comes in big portions, and they have good service, so I think it's worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=20

The chicken had no flavor even when it was cooked with peppers. There's no sauce in this dish, it was missing tomatoe sauce but instead it was dry all around. I did not even want to box this to-go.

Amy T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",264,13,69,3.0,10/30/2017,"Four category review!  Our party of two came at 6:10 on a Sunday night. We were seated 10-15 minutes later. Of course this place is packed but not as bad.  Parking: Parking is ample at this time since everyone is typically leaving for the mall. Parking is pretty easy near JcPenny if you don't mind the walk! :)   Ambiance: Its very loud and lively here. The decor is very grandeur. It's a very casual place nonetheless. Some come dressed. Some come from walking around the mall.  Service: We ordered two waters at 6:25pm. We got our waters at 6:27pm, we also ordered two entrees during this time. We were informed that our complimentary bread was in the oven, which was gratefully appreciated. Our waitress was a very nice young girl that was prompt and nice.  Food: the bread was very nice and toasty and crispy. So perfect for a snack. So appreciated. Our entrees arrived at 6:38pm I got the chicken chipotle pasta while my bf got the four cheese pasta with chicken. The four cheese pasta was ok. The pasta itself, hard. Honestly, I wish they offered freshly grated Parmesan cheese on both of ours. My chipotle pasta had a nice kick, but was over salted and the pasta itself was very dry. The plus side of being at this place are the portion size in comparison to price. I'm getting a two person portion for less than $20. Can't complain.  For dessert, what we mainly came for, was the fresh banana cheesecake. For some reason, our cheesecake was coated with a layer of ice on top. I was so disappointed. If you're gonna serve frozen then at least thaw it out so you can deceive just a tiny bit. Thanks. :(  Overall, eh. Haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=20
Nancy T.,"Rosemead, CA",178,198,491,5.0,6/7/2017,"Cheesecake factory is my friends and It's go-to ""wanna be fancy"" but usually broke dinner spots. I've been here multiple times and have always had a good experience. Servers are always super kind, and customer service is always on par.  This night we came in to celebrate my passing of my cset (2 down, 1 to go! Woot!) Plus I was introducing my best friend to the guy I was dating so it was a 2-1 deal . I ended up ordering a pasta and he ordered the steak/salmon combo. We also ordered a glass of wine as well as 2 cheesecakes. We got the chocolate one and the tiramisu.  Often times when I come, I always have to wait for a spot. But this night surprisingly we didn't have to wait at all. Once seated the server introduced himself and we put in our drinks order. They always give you complimentary bread, both sour dough and white along with butter. (Be careful, cuhs they're addicting and unlimited and then you get too full to eat your main meal).  We ended up spending around 120$ for 4 meals, a glass of wine, 2 ice teas, and 2 slices of cheesecake. Not too shabby for an Italian place. My go-to pasta was always the tomato basil pasta but decided to switch it up tonight.  Overall, I love coming to cheesecake factory to satisfy my pasta craving and pretend I'm high class and dining fancy.

Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720,3.0,4/5/2017,"When Cheesecake Factory opened up this location in Arcadia, it saved us time and energy in trying to make it to the Pasadena location, which is farther with some parking challenges. In all the times I've been here, there is usually a wait to get seated. My experiences at the Cheesecake Factory have been pretty consistent. Adequate service and the quality of food doesn't deviate (most of the time). On my last visit, I ordered my usual at Cheesecake - the seared ahi tuna tataki salad. Even though I had this so many times already, it still feels weird that the tomatoes come in slices like you'll have on a burger, rather than chopped up in wedges like a normal salad. BF branched out and tried the cajun chicken littles, which were fried boneless chicken breast pieces with mashed potatoes and corn succotash. BF subbed in french fries for mashed potatoes. It was good, though I doubt he'll add it to his rotating repertoire of what he'd usually order. It must have been super busy because we had table bread served on a plate and not the usual basket, even though the two tables next to us had their bread in a basket.  While there is a wait to get a table, there is also high chances of a wait to find parking too as you're competing with people visiting the mall, the AMC movie theater, and other restaurants on that side of Westfield.

Ellen M.,"San Marino, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/13/2018,"One star for the bread, and I would give a half star for the guy who grated our Parmesan (yelp won't let me give an extra half star). This is why... My friends and I called this restaurant to make a reservation, but they said they only did walk-ins. Therefore, we walked all the way across the mall to The Cheesecake Factory, and they told us we had to wait for 10-15 minutes to get our table, guaranteeing us that they'd have one ready. We reluctantly left the restaurant and came back when they told us to, in which they told us to wait for ANOTHER 20 minutes for a table. We finally got seated at a table outside that has been open the whole time, although they only let us sit at it 20 minutes after they told us to wait for a second time. The waiter seemed a little sketchy, but we thought it was probably the end of his shift. He asked us for our drinks 10 minutes after we were seated, although he saw us waiting right after we were assigned to our table. We ordered our food right when we ordered our drinks, but it took another half hour for our food to come. During that half hour, my friend asked where our food was. The waiter (David G) replied rudely, ""Probably in the kitchen"" and proceeded with a snarky head nod. After our food arrived, I felt like throwing up in the middle of eating my Pasta Da Vinci, and I never felt that way eating at The Cheesecake Factory before. My friends agreed, as they also started to feel sick, and I'm not surprised if we all get food poisoning the morning after. Additionally, one of my friends got the Fettuccine Alfredo which had the blandest chicken, even though she had to pay an extra $4 for it. We then asked for the check, which took 20 more minutes. Our visit was absolutely abysmal and overall disappointing. Never coming to this restaurant again.

My family and I always shamelessly ask for refills on bread throughout our meal.  Avocado Eggrolls- (5/5) My favorite appetizer! I love the contrast of the crispy exterior with the soft, creamy avocado filling. The tamarind-cashew dipping sauce is absolutely delicious & really elevates the appetizer.  Thai Lettuce Wraps- (4/5) Make-your-own lettuce wraps that can get a bit messy. The appetizer comes with 3 different dipping sauces and an assortment of lettuce wrap components to customize my wrap just to my liking.  Factory Combination: Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane- (5/5) My absolute favorite entree at Cheesecake Factory is chicken madeira. I can never get enough of the madeira sauce. Steak Diane is chunks of steak covered with black peppercorn & covered with a delicious wine sauce. The combination of the chicken and steak was delicious.  Tiramisu- (3/5) not a super strong coffee or liquor flavor & there was a bit too much whipped cream for the dish.

Sandy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",566,500,7270,3.0,4/10/2017,"Located at the Westfield Santa Anita Mall, this restaurant has been here for as long as I can remember as one the original ""regular"" restaurants chains in the mall. Fixed between Wood Ranch Grill & the newly opened Benihana, the atmosphere of the space is very similar to the majority of the other Cheesecake Factories around with the dimly lit interior space, comfortable (yet rigid) décor and the whiff of cheesecake in the display cases off to the side as you make your way to the hostess booth.  I arrived on a late Thursday evening and was seated promptly with my party (wait time can really range depending since it could be super busy or flowing traffic with no consistency). Our waitress was super attentive and brought everything to our table timely and refilling our waters often. We ordered a side order fries to share & it was quite yummy... their portion offerings are often quite large enough that you can share them among 2-3 people if you eat family style or if you want to share among yourselves. In addition to the double order of fries, we ordered several pasta dishes as well as their meatloaf. You can always count on Cheesecake Factory to present their foods with good taste and I haven't experienced any really bad service from this place yet.  + Spaghetti & Meatballs with penne substitute: pasta was al dente & the 3 meatballs were nice and moist - not dry at all in the center. But be warned, this isn't consistent since it really depends on how long they leave it cooking. + Famous Factory Meatloaf: Comes with a generous heaping of potatoes, 3-4 slices of meatloaf & a side of greens, this dish was pretty satisfying as well. Meat was thoroughly cooked and not dry at all. + Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (comes with Penne pasta): chicken was delicious and the spicy chipotle creamy sauce hit the spot right on! + Vegetarian twist on the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: this dish has the makings of all that vegetarians love with a carb twist - fresh broccoli, eggplants, peppers, artichokes, etc. all doused with a light olive dressing. Very flavorful and we added extra parmesan cheese for a nice cheesy flavor twist. We finished our meals and were off on our way, full & satisfied.

I think your food and service are awesome and consider every single visit to your restaurant a privilege. My last visit, however, was not my typical positive experience with your restaurant.  We ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and I asked for no peanuts. There was no follow up question from my server. When we were eating I noticed that the salad had almonds in it, I assumed that if I say no peanuts it's probably safe to not put any kinds of nuts. Anyway I raised my concern and my server was apologetic. She offered me a new salad but we were almost full by that time. The manager then came by and said ""there's no peanuts you're good to go,"" Then I responded it has these nuts, he said they're not nuts they're almonds so you're fine. I said no thanks and he took the food away. Common restaurant courtesy, if you're going to take someone's food away you should not charge them! Needless to say we were charged for the stupid salad.

Their service is always great so I never had a bad day with them. They always start you off with bread (after your order that is! My friend joked people might take off after eating their bread only). That's because they have the BEST wheat bread ever. It's so soft and sweeet! Heck, just take me there and give me bread and I'll be happy! But on a side note, they do have few dishes there that I absolutely love!  |Four Cheese Pasta| I've tried several pasta from them but this has been my staple for a very long time. Penne style is my favorite so this dish is it! It's very creamy and cheesy. This dish doesn't come with meat so it's additional $3 if you order with chicken. But I preferred less meat so I never order it with chicken.  |Calamari| This has to be my favorite appetizer from them. Nothing else. And yes, I did try several before. They use the right mount of batter that makes it perfectly crispy in my opinion. The texture is fresh and not too rubbery. The dipping sauce they serve with it go well with the calamari or just how I like it at least. Cocktail & garlic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=160

Ashley J.,"San Gabriel, CA",159,9,6,3.0,1/14/2016,"As we walk in, boo and I could tell that it was a busy night so when we gave the hostess our party number and name she said it would take about half an hour just to be seated.  We were really hungry and were not willing to wait even longer to eat so we decided to sit at the self-seat high tables by the bar (NO WAIT!!). At first, it took a while for any server to notice us. When a young lady finally did, we were given menus and complimentary bread that Cheesecake always provides. First thing I noticed when we were given the bread was that we were given some short (only 2 loaves in the tray)... and it was absolutely cold. I had wondered if the waitress brought us bread from a different party who did not finish theirs? (Kind of upsetting if that actually happened). Boo had to ask for fresh bread from a male server. When the bread came, it was fresh out of the oven and hot! with 3 loaves... Hmm.. We ordered the Cajun Jimbalya and the Chicken Biscuit. Cajun Jimbalya is usually very flavorful and spicy, but this time did not seem to fit all those categories. There were too much noodles and not enough flavor; bland. Had to ask the waitress for more spice and seasoning, but she brings out some sort of ""cajun"" soup that tasted awfully like tomato soup. So I had to ask another waitress that knew exactly what I meant and brought my dish back to the kitchen to be retossed in the Cajun butter. For dessert, boo ordered the Oreo cheesecake that was too sweet for me but he seemed to enjoy it.  Overall, the service was minimal (not sure if it had anything to do with being seated at self-seating tables) and the food was just OK. I would probably only come back for their complimentary honey wheat bread  and possibly an original cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=160

Linda S.,"Glendale, CA",45,21,,2.0,4/9/2017,"We went there for the first time after taking the kids to the Jumpin place next door. Our meal was good, but the service at the time was extremely slow. We had to ask random people for help, and instead of helping us, they would find our waiter. Don't get me wrong... I get it, we're not your table. I ordered a meal to go and we paid our bill and waited at the table. That's when we saw it! A WORM/CATERPILLAR thing climbing out of the broccoli stem. My son hates cooked vegetables so we ordered his broccoli raw. His food even came out last because the said they had to cut his fresh. The manager was super nice about it and comped our meal. He asked that we give them a second chance and return and a few weeks later we did. He assured me that he had sent the incident to corporate but that the isolated worm incident was a risk with any raw vegetables... except for salad which was triple washed. Personally, I think they should have the same washing standards all around, but that's just me. He said to ask for him, and I did. He said he would come check in us and make sure the experience was better, but I never saw him again after being seated. The food was the average Cheesecake standard, nothing super special and the waiter was much more attentive this time. I give them 2 stars for the food and the improved staff the second time around, but when a manager invites you back and promises to make sure you had a good experience, but never returns... well that just solidified our not returning to this location. I think we prefer the Americana or the Spectrum locations... even Canoga Park was better than what we've experienced here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=160

Never once had a bad meal. Last night we ate at the Arcadia one for my wife's BDay and although the service was good, the food was not. Food was dry and portions seemed smaller. Ordered cashew chicken-the chicken is usually large pieces and has a pan fry coating with a slight crunch to it. This one had tiny pieces and tasted like it was diced chicken slightly dipped in a sauce. No pan fry. It was also very dry. The garlic mashed potatoes we ordered had no flavor. Definitely missing something. A chicken parm sandwich was dry.  Cheesecake Factory has had great success with all their restaurants throughout the US because they all follow the same recipes, prep and procedures.  Hope this philosophy isn't changing and that they're not turning into a typical chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=200

After being seated, our server came promptly and I ordered a salmon plate, and it was very scrumptious. The portions are very generous, so you'd be filled up before the plate is half way through. Not only that, the fish is actually fresh and did not induce any allergic reactions.  All the while we were there, I  could't help but feel I was actually sitting within the caesar palace buffet at Las Vegas. The decor of the factory exudes  a richness that was.. very much flamboyant, and a bit overwhelming.

She said they predetermine how much drink they put in, so since I didn't want much ice, this is how much it was. I think that's crazy. Asked to speak to manager. Had to ask to different staff members before manager, Kenny, came to my table. Explained my issue, he offered to bring my drink in a smaller glass since I didn't want as much ice. What the hell.

Another small concern was when the gentleman who seated us was eating something.  I didn't see that as being professional.   I am apprehensive going there, again, or having any functions there.  Cheesecake Factory, we had a good run.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=320

Fran B.,"Los Angeles, CA",835,614,120,4.0,5/1/2014,"I like Cheesecake Factory. I usually HATE chain restaurants like Chili's, Black Angus, or stupid ass f*king Claim Jumper. But Cheesecake is not like those restaurants. It's a lot classier (in terms of menu, service, and decor), and the food is actually good. Oh but I don't like their cheesecake. Tried a bunch of different flavors, but meh. Their cheesecakes are too creamy and not cheesy enough. I like my cheesecakes a little crumbly (think cheesy crumbly) and light, but rich. I don't want no soft ass, overly creamy cheesecake.  My favorite dish is probably the cajun jambalaya pasta. I loooove cajun seasoning, and this pasta has got it down right. It's a little spicy, flavorful, and packed up with plump shrimps and tender chicken. Actually, Cheesecake Factory has really good pastas. I've tried a bunch, including the angel hair pasta, da vinci something, and a few other ones (can't remember the names), and haven't ran into a bad pasta dish yet. I also liked the ""chicken littles"" dish, which I think is basically just chicken tenders? The fried mac and cheese is always a winner (what diet, right?). Also tried a couple salads and they were good. Overall, it's not the most gourmet food, but definitely consistent and a bit above average. Except their cheesecakes. They blow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=320

However, Cheesecake Factory offers a wide selection of items on their menu, making it a good restaurant to go to if you and your friends are having difficulties coming to an agreement on where to eat.  Besides the food, the service here is a hit or miss. From my most recent visit, the service was terrible. The hostess did not acknowledge us and took a while to get us seated on a weekday during the least busiest time of day. The servers here are chatty amongst themselves and often neglected us.

I then waited in line for a few minutes and when I asked the guy about the wait on the phone he was completely unapologetic, and just blamed it on the receptionist. I then had to wait 5 minutes for them to package up the two desserts which could have all been avoided if I wasn't on hold for so long. It would be far more understandable on a weekend but on a Monday night at 8:45 I'm not sure what could have been keeping them all so busy. Very disappointed.

Lightly battered white meat chicken pieces, mostly large with a light delicate sauce of orange with thin slices of orange peel. The vegetables with the sauce that it comes with are so good. I wish I could make vegetables like that at home. I wonder what sauce it is. I know I can definitely taste hints of sesame oil. The wait here is like any other Cheesecake Factory on peak hours & days. Their Chicken Bellagio is also one of my Ultimate favorites. The chicken is lightly breaded & tender. Topped with Prosciutto, parmesan & butter leafy Arugula. It comes with this delicious basil pesto spaghetti. Their mixed drinks are pretty well made.

Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,4.0,12/23/2014,"This Westfield Arcadia is one of the nicest So Cal shopping malls that I have ever been to, and this Cheesecake Factory (TCF) location is no exception. I've probably been here about four times with several different friends, and I always experienced attentive service and a clean environment. Because I was dining with just one other friend, we usually didn't have to wait for too long to get seated (I think one exception was on a Saturday night for dinner, but that was during prime dinner time). Usually, I can count on being seated promptly (perks of dining in a small party). My great experiences at this Cheesecake Factory ensure my return if I'm ever at this mall or in the area. Though parking can sometimes be a pain (especially on the weekends or during holiday season), dining at this Cheesecake Factory has been mostly pleasant and hassle free.   I think the most memorable experience I had at this Cheesecake Factory location was dining with a friend for a late lunch/early dinner one Sunday afternoon, and the eatery wasn't too crowded. We ate at our leisure and I think we were actually in the restaurant for almost three hours total, just catching up, talking and having a good time. I love when dining experiences are memorable because of the company and because of the relaxing environment (would have been a totally different experience if we were rushed through our meal and the eatery was super crowded, as the Waikiki Cheesecake Factory always is).   Here are some of my favorites when it comes to dining at the famous CF: ""Fish & Chips"": My mom ordered this entrée once for dinner and I had one of her fish pieces. I'm always on the lookout for a good fish & chips meal, so I'm glad I got to try this dish. It features hand-battered fillets that are fried crisp and served with cole slaw, French Fries and tartar sauce. The fish's interior was moist and I did like the battered interior -- crispy, crunchy and buttery, but not overdone. I did like it enough to order it for my entrée in the future, but the fish pieces were pretty small for the hefty price of the meal. If the fish pieces were bigger, it might be more worth it, but that price holds me back and keeps me sticking to my usual burger/sandwich entrees. ""OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake"": Though I prefer the original version of this cheesecake (and want it to return), I was glad to try this slight rendition. This cheesecake differs from the original OREO one because it includes a layer of moist fudge cake and OREO cookie mousse atop the cheesecake. It's similar to the original in that it has OREO cookies baked into the creamy layer of cheesecake and is topped with a milk chocolate icing. I had mixed feelings about this cheesecake and preferred the original just because I was not a huge fan of the mousse layer (I don't like mousse in general ... nothing against this cheesecake). But, I really liked the layer of moist, fudgy chocolate cake interspersed with the layer of cheesecake (similar to my favorite ""Reese's Peanut Butter"" cheesecake), and the OREO cookie chunks baked into the cheesecake itself is probably my favorite component of the entire dessert. If the mousse layer were eliminated, I would have no problem with this cheesecake being on the menu instead of the original OREO creation. ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake"":  I have ordered this cheesecake once, and though it was good, I felt that for this version, the red velvet cake would have tasted better when separated from the cheesecake. This was a combo that actually shouldn't have combined the two delicacies. I did like the red velvet cake, but felt that the cake itself could have been more moist. However, that cream cheese frosting was amazing and gave the drier cake some redemptive quality. I did like the Original Cheesecake as well, but again, it would have been better not to mix the two. At least I did get to try this red velvet fantasy. I still really like red velvet, but would have preferred this cake solo for dessert (or the cheesecake solo ... either or, not both at once). ""Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae"": My friend told me that she ordered an ice cream sundae from TCF before because the brownies were superb, so I might have to order one for myself to see what she's talking about. This sundae features a rich Godiva chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream and toasted almonds. Since the brownie is Godiva, I believe it when my friend said that this was one of the best brownies she's ever tasted. I would get this sundae sans the whipped cream and almonds, but everything else sounds wonderful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=320

Christine A.,"Granada Hills, CA",288,490,1392,5.0,8/17/2013,"This is by far my favorite Cheesecake Factory in all of Southern Los Angeles. It's larger compared to the Pasadena and The Grove locations, and if you don't come during the lunch/dinner rush, there is ample free parking. I'm a creature of habit when it comes to this place, so I tend to order between the meatloaf, chicken marsala, chicken madeira, or the spicy chipotle chicken pasta. Every single time I have come here, the food is always perfect. Nothing is bland, or too cold. The meat is always flavorful, tender, and juicy. You can't go wrong.  Cheesecakes: I can never come here without having at least one for here, and one to go. My favorites are the banana cheesecake, pumpkin cheesecake (seasonal), cherry cheesecake, and the red velvet. Some of the other ones like the key lime, Snickers, etc. are a bit too sweet for me.  Downside: They have one burrito dish, they don't tell you on the menu, but it comes with white rice which I find odd. I didn't like that at all. Another downside is the wait. If you come during the lunch/dinner rush, especially on the weekend, be prepared to wait about an hour or longer.  Service here has always been great.

Melissa L.,"Portland, OR",1459,1044,793,4.0,10/8/2015,"I generally avoid Cheesecake Factory.  I find the food overpriced and laden with calories & sodium.  Plus, anytime a restaurant has a menu that big with that many pages, I'm naturally nervous about freshness. So imagine my surprise of the very pleasant experience I had on a Wednesday night for dinner with my teen daughter (yes, she asked to eat here.)   This was my first time at this location (The view of the Redondo Beach location is great; however, the Old Town Pasadena location is too crowded). Daughter and I walked in and we were seated immediately at a small quiet booth.  Okay, I was liking my seat...then we were handed the giant book of a menu and a small 2 pager menu.  The 2 pager menu was the ""skinnylicious"" menu of entrees under 590 calories.  FINALLY.  After consistently having entrees ranked the worst in the country for calories & sodium, you have listened and created healthier options.   Further, I was able to get a glass of a good Russian River Chardonnay. My entree? Seared Tuna Tataki Salad-The Ahi tasted fresh and was prepared correctly.  Plus, I enjoyed the Wasabi vinaigrette and appreciated that they put it on the side so that you can decide how much you want to add to the mixed greens. Finally, our server, Cody L was fantastic.  He was attentive and friendly.  Further, he offered to give my daughter a soda in a to go cup.  KUDOS; my daughter loved this. I have heard from a good source, that Cheesecake doesn't use Yelp.  So how do they get feedback?  They expect people to contact their corporate office.  NAH, I'm not writing comments to more than one place.

Because it is attached to the Arcadia Westfield mall, you are more likely to run into jerks like me that bring their kids out to a restaurant on a Friday night.  Crowds tonight or considerable, and the supposed 15 minute wait time came and went like the minuscule bread plate put on our table with three ravenous children at the ready to devour.   We saw one very young couple - maybe 16 or 17 years old - that appeared to be here on the first date.  The extended wait time in the lobby resulted in the casualty of an apparent wall in conversation. I knew he was in trouble when she took out her phone made a call, and started talking as if he wasn't there. Epic fail. As previously stated, the menu has been discussed ad nauseum on other reviews.  Interestingly, this particular cheesecake factory has the added bonus of good people watching, considering that it is so close to Arcadia, the freeway, and to repeat-- it's attached to a mall.

Once we sat down, it took another 5-10min for service.

I was hesitant to get this because I hate when salmon is over cooked, but not here! It was cooked perfect! Their shrimp scampi was also DELICIOUS with lots of garlic and butter burnt onto the shrimp giving it lots of flavor! There were 3 shrimps so the bf and I split 1 1/5 shrimps for each person. :)  The dish also came with three asparagus as well for veggies.

They have one of my favorite dish I've had a restaurant. It's Miso Salmon. It's miso marinated salmon served on a bed of rice w/ snow peas and miso sauce. Just delicious!! I've had this dish at 4 or 5 other Cheesecake Factory and they've perfected it. It's the same in each location. I'm sure they have other dishes but I just love this dish.  My wife got the Renee's Special. One-Half of a Fresh Turkey or Chicken Salad Sandwich, a Cup of Our Soup and a Small Green Salad. She got the turkey salad sandwich, baked potato soup and for an extra buck, she got the Caesar salad instead of the green salad. Her verdict, yum, yum & yum!!  In her words the best turkey salad sandwich she's ever had. And she's a turkey sandwich aficionado.  Well, a visit here is not complete without indulging in a cheesecake or two.  We got the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut  Cheesecake, another one I always get (red velvet is the other). It's still as good as I remember it yum!! We got a Kahlua Cheesecake to go (wifey request). What's not to like? Kahlua in cheesecake, super delicious. I might have to add a third wheel to the cheesecake list. Lol.  Service was okay. Our waitress seemed eager to kick us out. She kept asking if she could wrap our food. If you asked 5 times, that's too much. My wife was feeding my boy so she hardly touched her food and the waitress was oblivious to that fact. Not cool.  The place is beautiful decorated. I love the Murano glass style lighting they had.  The tables are pretty spaced close together. So close, conversations aren't private. Lol.  They have a small dessert counter at the entrance if you're interested in a to go cheesecake.  I can always count on a good meal here and oh, the cheesecake are awesome as well. lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=180

We weren't in a chatty mood so he just took our orders, brought our stuff, refilled drinks and checked up on us a few times. Food was on par for this type of place. I mean it was pretty good but it wasn't ""I need this in my life forever"". Don't think I'll make a special trip here if I don't need to shop at the mall, but will definitely be back when I shop.

Azure S.,"Rosemead, CA",0,151,,2.0,11/27/2016,"It took a little while to be seated but I figured it was because there seemed to be an event going on nearby when I visited and many people came to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch.  The server I started with seemed pretty good, but she was switched out not long after I was seated and the guy who replaced her, while nice and all, was rarely there. In fact, there was hardly anyone to ask for service such as boxing up leftovers and getting the check.  The food took more than a half hour for to appear and tables that were seated later got their food sooner. But maybe the gumbo took a while to prepare?  The gumbo was good. I also had the dulce de leche cheesecake which unfortunately did not taste as good as it sounded.  The bathrooms were clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=240

Was able to be seated within five minutes and had a pretty attentive waiter. Ordered Renee's Special (side garden salad, chicken salad sandwich and mushroom soup). As usual it was pretty delicious and had a good portion size.  Also took a chance and ordered the Firecracker Salmon. Unfortunately wasn't that impressive. It's salmon pieces wrapped in spinach and fried in a crispy wrapper with sweet and spicy chili sauce for around $12.  While the presentation looked nice, that was about it. There's only four pieces on the plate about the size of a roll of quarters, and the inside reminds me of how bags of chips now are: 70% air 30% food; not much there. There's also a large piece of cabbage to fill the plate if you like eating it.  Overall, the experience is good and food consistently good. Prices for some items  getting a bit too high: I.e. $3 for a soda, $15 for chicken Caesar, etc.  But for a beautiful interior ambience, great service, your complimentary bread and good portion sizes, enjoy.

Michelle W.,"Alhambra, CA",277,114,426,2.0,12/11/2015,"Alright so, for some reason, I keep having a really hard time with this place... Around October, on my friend's birthday, we decided to get food here. The experience was the same, very good! Before we ordered, we mentioned it was our friend's birthday so he would get a song and some special little dessert! The food portion seemed smaller than usually but I could manage! Everything was fine until I found a pea in my meatballs and 'penne' (I switched it from spaghetti to penne cause you can do that!). I brought it up with my friends and then we laughed about it since it was just a small out of nowhere experience. And besides, I like peas in the first place! But what happened next was pretty terrible. I bit into a piece of sharp, flat, charred piece of metal. It cut the gums behind my teeth...  I started bleeding slightly, it wasn't that deep of a cut, but I was panicky. If I had swallowed that, there would have been consequences. We told our waitress about it, and she looked at the food. Afterwards she had to get the manager and he apologized for it and took the food away. He said he wouldn't charge me either, but I still was really hungry. I only got to eat one meatball and some pasta! Afterwards, I think the girl made a mistake on the check because she 'paid' for my bad meal? Like she gave us an extra 18 dollars? We asked but she seemed like she was confused and in a hurry.  My friend never got his birthday song, and I was still pretty hungry. I visited again after a couple of weeks, and was randomly chosen to do a survey on my receipt. I told them about my experience, and they gave me a $10 card, but I guess because it wasn't a good experience, they apologized and offered me a $50 gift card! I like the gestures but I would really appreciate it if they actually talk to their team about this. So on the 10th of December, I ordered a lousiana chicken pasta and a shephard's pie, both lunch size. They told me it would take 15 to 20 minutes, which I gave them before I walked there since I work at the same mall. They made me wait 10+ extra minutes even though my order was right on the side, and I ended up using most of my break time. Plus the walk to and back are around 5 to 8 minutes long each. (I work at the opposite side of the mall and I have short legs since I'm 5'1.). The food by then was damp, clammy, and dripping wet. The man who helped me however, was very nice about it and made the experience a bit better.  Other than that, I feel this place is losing its touch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=240

To all managers, you have an ongoing problem that you have never addressed properly.    Your paging system doesn't work inside the mall, and you all know this. So why don't you label the pagers to state that it doesn't work in the mall. That's it, it's that easy. We went in yesterday evening and was given a 50 to 65 minute wait. We're at the mall, why wouldn't we take a little walk. Came back early only to be told, we paged you already. Sorry the pagers don't work in the mall, that would have been nice to know before we left the restaurant. If course another 15 minutes and we were seated.

Abigail C.,"Temple City, CA",216,24,4,1.0,7/18/2016,"Ordered the crab cake. I'm never coming back again. I came here on a Sunday with my sisters trying to enjoy our weekend together as we are usually busy with our individual lives. I ordered the crab cake and there were barely any crabs on my plate. My plate consisted of: greasy, overly-salted, BURNED potatoes; two eggs; a sauce that didn't have much role in the meal other than coloring my food; and very few pieces of crab meats here and there. I didn't expect to get a full crab leg or anything close to it, but the amount of crab meat I got was just ridiculous. Overall, I was just stuffing down the burned potatoes the whole time. ($13.9x not including tax and tips for burned potatoes? No thanks)  Now for the service... First of all, one of our orders never came, but that wasn't a big deal as I understand that waiters have a lot on their plates and can forget some things here and there. However, the service my waiter provided was just unbelievable. Okay now, one of my sisters arrived late and when she got here, the waiter LITERALLY gave gave her an eye-roll!!! Yes, she may be panting a little due to the fact that she was trying to hurry up as she was late, but an eye-roll? Really??? Now, this is not all. Later on, we had to consistently ask some other waiters for water or extra orders as our waiter was no where in sight. Guess what? The waiter we asked told us that he is not our waiter and ask us to wait for our waiter to come. He did not inform our waiter that we were looking for her and  our waiter did not come until the very end, when we were all done with our food.

Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1536,1308,2750,3.0,11/20/2014,"Restaurant chains don't normally appeal to me, but Cheesecake Factory is a guilty pleasure. The food isn't the best, but the quality and taste is consistent, my expectations are always met, and the menu has a variety of safe choices. This particular location has been around since the mall remodeled and added the current food court area (10 years now?). During high school, Cheesecake Factory was the fancy schmancy ""it"" place you'd go to for special occasions, so I've been here more times than I can care to remember. Now, it's a place to go to when no one can decide what to eat. Bar seating and high-top tables are first come, first serve. I don't think I've ever waited for a table at this location, just because I usually come on weekdays (if you're a local, you know to stay away from this hell hole of a mall on weekends). There's also patio seating, which is nice, but there's not much of a view to look at. The service has always been a hit or miss, averaging 3-star quality. For food, I usually stick with a pasta: either Pasta Da Vinci or Tomato Basil. If I'm not in the mood for carbs, I'll get a chicken or fish dish. I'd recommend Crispy Chicken Costoletta or Miso Salmon. Portions are always double what you're actually able to eat, so it's nice to pack up the leftovers for lunch or dinner for the next day. Whatever you end up choosing, I'm sure it will taste fine. Dessert options are endless as well, but I find myself gravitating towards the Original Cheesecake with Strawberries more often than not. Parking can be a hassle, just because it's mall parking, but there are lots everywhere and the mall isn't that big to navigate through. There is valet directly in front but I've never used it, as well as curb-side parking for take-out pick-ups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=240

However, if my friends choose to have a meal here, I'll happily oblige. The few times I've dined at this location have been fantastic. The service has been wonderful and the food have been well-prepared.  Skinnylicious Grilled Steak Medallions - Angus beef over a bed of mashed potatoes and surrounded by asparagus, Shiitake mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, in a Madeira wine sauce and sprinkled with crushed croutons. Absolutely delectable. I would definitely order this again.  Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken - Thick pasta with chicken strips drenched in a Parmesan cheese sauce. Heavy stuff, so it's good to share, unless you can finish the entire plate yourself. Factory Combination: Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi - Angus beef coated in a black peppercorn, mushroom, and wine sauce along side 3 large shrimps sauteed with cloves of garlic, tomato, and basil atop some angel hair pasta and separated with a generous portion of mashed potatoes. Gotta love this land and sea pairing. Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake - Cheesecake swirled with blueberries and topped with a layer of white chocolate mousse and shavings. The crust had hints of cinnamon. I don't like cream cheese, but this was quite heavenly. The blueberry added that tartness, white chocolate provided the smoothness and cream cheese was pure richness. Factory Peach Bellini - Champagne, peaches, and peach liqueur. It's like a peach slush. I like their complimentary little bread basket. I especially love the squaw bread! This brown bread has a nice crust, soft center, perfect amount of sweetness and topped with rolled oats. I usually like to ask for more, if I'm particular ravenous that day.

Today, Saturday April 8, at 2pm, we wanted to have lunch in one of our favorite restaurants, and that it cheesecake factory, we ordered, our lunch was awesome as usual BUT after we paid the check, we have realized that my Cousin's phone was missing. We looked everywhere and we were sure that we had it with us 'since we used the hotspot of the phone before lunch' but all of the sudden the phone is not there. We called the waitress, if by chance she picked it up by mistake while picking up the dishes, she said No, she haven't seen it, so we called the manager, she was very helpful, took out the seats and looked for it everywhere with us, but still no phone, I tried to call, but still no answer, no rings, nothing...  The manager told us that she can check the security camera to see what happened, at that moment the waitress who just left us decided to come back telling us that someone have found the phone in the restroom and gave it to the front desk, and she gave us the phone back asking us wether it belongs to us or not. Obviously it was our phone. The only problem is that My cousin haven't gone to the restroom at all or left our booth where we were sitting.

Sitting outside is basically asking to be ignored by the servers and weekends are so hectic you won't even be able to ask for more butter for your bread! Nonetheless, the food is decent, but the lunch specials are what makes it worth coming! There is also a new addition to the menu called ""superfoods"" which is great for vegans and vegetarians like myself! I recommend the falafel salad (extra dressing on the side since kale is a little bitter), french country salad, herb chicken, and da vinci pasta. They recently redid their herb chicken so it's a little crispier which I like and the da vinci pasta I always ask for bowtie pasta since I think it tastes better!

It's usually crowded on the weekends, especially during dinner time and if you have a pretty big party, it's wise to make a reservation.  I really like the Miso Salmon. My friends recommended it to me, and it tastes every bit as good as the name. The fish is not only tender, but soft to a point that it basically melts in your mouth. The rice ... is not as comparable. Since I eat rice almost every night, I wished the rice was softer and less grainy. The sauce was really nice and added a nice touch to the fish.  I've also ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club twice, and it's good. Nothing too special, but I have been told that I should order something more ""upscale"" if I'm going to eat here. Which is the reason I ordered the Miso Salmon the next time I came.  I've also tried their Chicken Alfredo which was good and creamy.  As for the cheesecakes, yes they are super delicious but a bit on the expensive side. When they have their deal of ""half off a slice of cheesecake when dining in"" ... that's the only time I would order it.  Overall, it's an okay restaurant. The food is average, but the prices are a bit on the more expensive side. It's a bit too dim for my liking, and sometimes the waiters and waitresses seem to be so tired or too caught up chit-chatting with each other than wanting to help their tables. And if you go with a big group ... just don't. They weren't willing to split the checks or were really annoyed at how long we took to gather up the money.

Monday - Friday, Happy Hours 4-6 PM! Oh god, the $5 appetizers are nuts! I love the calamari and the buffalo blasts. 3. Don't get the nacho's for happy hour, chicken is extra! 4. Lunch specials til 5 PM! 5. Try the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cheesecake.... oh god. 6. I like the factory burrito, but it's pretty expensive for what you get! The portions are pretty big though! For more read on! I used to go to this place for dinner... but by gosh it's REALLY expensive. I still think though that Happy Hour has some great drink/food deals. They have appetizers for $5 and it also happens to cross over to lunch deals too! But regardless, I have some key dishes that my family swears by when we head to Cheesecake: - The factory burrito -- a fat burrito, topped with cheese and chili verde sauce and filled with white rice, onions, corn, tomatoes, and chicken. Also comes with a side of sour cream and guacamole! I would suggest extra chili verde sauce! - The jambalaya -- My mom loves it, though I'm sure most people will agree they have had better! - Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad -- This salad is amazing. It's like a southwest chicken salad to begin with, but you add onion strings and barbecue sauce and ranch! It's so good and the portion is huge! Highly recommend for the deal during lunch hours, only $10! - The White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake -- absolutely tremendous cheesecake. SO good. But so expensive........... I remember a few years back when they had a free piece for cheesecake day.... but I digress! There are plenty of nuts in this cheesecake and the white chocolate is sweet, but not too overwhelmingly sweet. Anyways service for my family and my girlfriend have always been good!

Alyssa X.,"Rosemead, CA",452,33,74,3.0,4/3/2014,"Cheesecake factory's food is on the side of mediocre, but their cheesecake is to die for! The environment is good for a romantic dinner for two at the booths. The ambient noise level is a bit high though. The tables are placed too close to each other so it's a bit hard to talk to your group of friends when another party beside you are talking.  Service is whatever's, they're attentive for the first minutes while taking your order, but after your food is out, the servers run off and leave you. My wheat bread that came with my entree was burnt compared to the complementary breads they provided to us with. I tried their garlic pasta with peas, shitake mushrooms, tomatoes, & the  omelettes. Don't try the shitake mushrooms, it made my tummy ache ): their dishes are on the heavy side,  even with their low calorie menu , come eat for lunch, so you're able to walk it  off, or come in for an early dinner, but nothing late or you find yourself regretting your indulgence.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=400

To start we had the Fried Calamari & Chinese Chicken Salad.  Both perfectly prepared like always. Calamari batter was light & crispy and the salad was well dressed with all the toppings. Chicken Parmesan Sandwich was filling. It had crispy chicken with a delicious marinara to dip in. Wild Mushroom Burger was juicy with lots of grilled onions, however lacked mushrooms. Sliced mushrooms were equivalent to half or one whole mushroom.  Factory Burrito Grande was huge, but had very little chicken. It was mostly white rice. Portion sizes are huge. You'll have plenty to take home.  As for dessert, we got the Oreo Dream Extreme, Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, &  Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple to go. All were yummy! Overall, my experience here has been the same as my last few visits.  Ambiance always nice. Service just okay. This time around would have been nice to be greeted upon arrival & acknowledge when leaving. To my surprise restaurant wasn't too busy. Just had to wait less than five minutes to be seated.

BUT, they didnt bring back my doggy bag! i had half of the delicious shepherds pie promised to me in a to-go bag! after feeling heart broken, i looked around and spotted a rogue to-go back at one of the registers! so i told one of the employees i was going to check the bag and sure enough it was my missing shepherds pie. glad i found it, but a really bad wrap to the dinner :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=400

Wasin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,73,198,2.0,2/22/2012,"Normally I don't waste my time reviewing chain restaurants because you know what you're getting when you come to these sort of places. Generic menus with generic food. I don't even like eating at these sort of places but the other week a couple of friends and I were around the area and didn't know where we could grab a quick bite. We went on our foursquare app and found out this Cheesecake Factory was offering a 20% off $50 discount so why not. Their pastas are decent right? Our dinner took longer than originally planned. It was the weekend so it was packed. We waited 30 minutes before we were seated but that's fine, the hostess told us this when we asked to be put on the waiting list. But seriously, do people not have better places to eat at? I started off with their sour apple martini. I'm a sucker for appletinis. This had to be the worst appletini I've ever had in my life. It tasted decent enough, like their strawberry lemonade. But I ordered a martini. Where was the alcohol in here? I can understand them forgetting the vermouth but where was the vodka to the schnapp? Not to mention it was $12. I normally do not complain about drinks but seriously, a simple cocktail for that much? Especially when it's obviously watered down? And the server had the audacity to ask if I wanted another one. Shakes my head. Moving on to the food. Started off with their avocado eggrolls. That dish is pretty darn good. Much better than their crab cakes. Then we had our entrees. I had the shrimp scampi with their diane steak combination. The shrimp scampi and mashed potatoes were decent enough I suppose. I actually like the scampi without the capellini. However the steak medallions was terrible. What wine sauce do they use to cook it with here? It clashed with the meat terribly. It was like they put an asian oyster sauce in hopes of marinating the beef but it came out as a fail. And the cooks here needs to learn what a medium steak looks like. It seems they have trouble with all types of meat because my friend's meat loaf didn't come out so great too. In summary, we were so dissatisfied we even bother trying one of their cheesecakes for desserts. You can come here if you want. But my experience here this past week reminded me why I wouldn't. There are a lot of other places in the area one can eat at that would have better food and drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=400

Plus I feel good choosing the fresh veggie option amongst all the other fried appetizers. With that said though, we recently discovered the fried avocado, portabella and zucchini fries (listed under the small plates section), and those are pretty amazing not gonna lie. All the other options (i.e. sliders, mini chicken sandwiches, etc) are okay if you're looking for more substantial bar food. I had the HH burger once and immediately, I was in bloat city. It's still a huge burger that's a great value, but really detrimental to anyone's (digestive) health.

I always try something new every time I come here, and let me just say that my favorite thing about the cheesecake factory are their mashed potatoes.

Peter C.,"Alhambra, CA",369,599,1118,3.0,2/2/2010,"Of all the big chains, I think Cheesecake Factory gets the most venom directed toward it, but I'm always a little unsure why.  For a family dining place, the menu is big, the bread is nice (hands off the squaw bread!  that's mine!) and the prices are fair.  Mrs. C and I sat down to a nice lunch, and decisions were made quickly.  Me: pizza + caesar salad lunch.  Her: lunch size pasta da vinci.  Wow was her dish good.  If you had the time to cook down Marsala wine, mushrooms and chicken, you could probably make it this good, but this is a very respectable dish.  The penne pasta even has little ridges to hold the sauce.  My pizza and salad are equally good.  I almost got the BBQ chicken, but I decided to get the everything pizza. I've seen some amazing servers at Cheesecake Factory.  Once I was with a group of 20, and the server didn't write anything down.  Not a thing.  And this person nailed everyone's entree.  Impressive.  Anyway, we sat in Tiffany's section and while we didn't have a large group to test her memory skills, I will say that I was in a position to observe her section fill up as the hostess kept seating tables, and she STILL managed to check on us every 8 or 10 mins.  Grabbed my iced tea without me even having to ask.  ""How's everything tasting so far?""  ""Oh, you need a box?""   Just very polite, attentive service all the way around. I think this may anger some chain haters, but I actually look forward to eating here.  Take a piece of Kahula cocoa almond fudge cheesecake to go.  You only live once!  You may have to spend an extra hour at the workout club, but I'm pretty sure it's worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=420

To start, we got seated and when the bread arrived, we went o get our knives and found food still on our silverware. they replaced it. What's bad is all our silverware was dirty. So we order. The children got the mini corn dogs, my friends got fish and chips, and I got the carbonara with chicken. So we waited for the food. The children's meals come out and one of my friends fish and chips. not the other 2 plates. waited over ten minutes and still no plates. Also, my friend that had gotten her plate had got no salad dressing for her salad. she had also asked for lemon and malted vinegar and got none. I asked for the manager and when she came over we explained the situation. She apologized. we got our food within a couple of minutes after that. Still no salad dressing or malted vinegar. On the next pass we asked again for them and finally got them. My friends seemed okay with the food. Mine on the other hand was supposed to be carbonara with chicken over angel hair pasta. Well, I found fettuccine in it first of all. The bacon was burnt and the sauce was like soup. Brought it to the manager's attention again. she said that she would take care of it and apologized again. Well, I guess taking care of it was a free slice of cheesecake and a staff discount on the food. With everything that happened, I think a little more should have been done.

I've gotten their factory nachos and the last two times I got it I was a little sad because they use the liquidy cheese instead of just all shredded cheese and it doesn't create the same ooey gooey-ness it used to. They have a HUGE menu and they have some good inexpensive small plates from some delicious fried cheese triangles to a roasted beet salad. Their calamari is also pretty good too...and I rarely ever eat calamari...the breading was delicious and I LOVE their dipping sauce. I usually get a pasta dish when I go there and 95% of time it's always good. The other 5% accounts for the times I've ordered something and it was quite bland. I either the pasta carbonara, five cheese pasta (and add mushrooms), the bistro shrimp pasta (the shrimp is fried so it gets a little greasy), or the crusted chicken romano which is  GIANT plate of panko breaded chicken and pasta. I like to mix in alfredo sauce in the pasta to make a creamy marinara mix and add mushrooms and spinach. It's absolutely delicious. They put so much on there I have enough for two meals. & who can go to The Cheesecake Factory without trying their cheesecake?

They prepare it just the way you order it. I am a sucker for masked potatoes and they make the best!!!! I mean really the 3 stars I'm giving is all based on the food. The food alone would be 5 stars but we all know that the review is about the entire restaurant.  The cons:  On more than one occasion we have been sat at a table that still had dirty utensils. Once seems reasonable we all make mistakes but more than a couple times let's me know that they don't pay much attention to cleaning up. The drinks selection isn't very good. A lot of wines but my gf and I aren't wine ppl so maybe this is just distasteful for us. The menu seems a tad bit over priced. The look they try to give this place will make you think the price is fair but let's be honest this just another franchise  restaurant.  Overall, the food is good.

Annalyn K.,"Yorba Linda, CA",32,44,25,5.0,11/17/2013,"Well, we had to wait over an hour wait today ( Saturday night ) because the party ahead of us had paid, but were sitting there. They told us 30 minutes, but we waited for over an hour. The Assistant Manager and Senior Manager were both aware of our situation and apologized. Chris, the Senior Manager, took our orders for the four kids even before we were seated to ensure they would be served first. We were seated and were almost immediately greeted by Chris and the Chef who had personally brought out the food for the kids - thank goodness! They were very apologetic for the long wait and allowed us to order a few appetizers on them! I thought it was very kind of them to do so. The food was great, Chris kept on checking up on us to see if we were ok and we had a great dinner despite the super long wait.  Then when we got the bill, we found out that not only did they comp the 2 appetizers as he mentioned, he also comped the 4 kids meals!!! We really didn't expect that and would never ask for it! So we went to say thank you and he again apologized for the long wait. We knew it wasn't his fault at all; sometimes bigger groups take longer to leave which is the only reason why we had to wait so long. But both managers really took care of us and definitely made up for it. They really went out of their way to make sure of it and that is very much appreciated.

I'm glad we ended up here, since we had an awesome waitress.  Not only did she automatically offer to substitute brown rice in for the pasta that normally comes with their Jambalaya offering (seriously, who orders Jambalaya pasta?), but also she suggested making the dish ""heavy"", aka extra crushed tomatoes.  The chicken was tender; the sauce, zesty; and the tomatoes, bursting with flavor.  She saw to it that the lady's grilled salmon was cooked by the head line chef - meaning, it was moist and flavorful, subtly seasoned with whipping creme and fresh Rosemary, versus a dried piece of cardboard that is often the case when ordering seafood at a mega chain.

Jennifer H.,"Pasadena, CA",128,175,74,1.0,1/5/2015,"I don't enjoy going to old town on the weekends, so I came to this location.  Probably wont make that choice again. We were excited to go, we had few gift cards and my boyfriend wanted a steak and I wanted a salad with their yummy blue cheese dressing.   Since we had the gift cards, we decided to have a couple of drinks, which we don't normally do, since they are about $12 a drink, which is ridiculous to pay, especially in Arcadia.  But I love a good raspberry lemon drop and they make killer ones, so that's what I ordered.  The waiter seemed confused.  A raspberry lemonade?  No, a raspberry lemon drop... I know it's not on the menu, but I've been ordering them at multiple Cheesecake Factories for the last 5-10 years.  You put your raspberry puree at the bottom, then the rest is like a lemon drop.  Well, of course the waiter came back saying they didn't have them.  To me, it's quite ridiculous of a bar to say they don't have something... especially when they have all of the ingredients and you are paying $12 a drink.  I tried to explain I'd been ordering them for years, but I'd pick something else, to give me a minute. The waiter came back shortly saying there was a miscommunication at the bar, they did have them and I'd get one shortly.  The waiter came out with something not in a martini glass that was a raspberry lemonade type drink they had on the menu, which was not the same thing.  It really didn't taste like there was any alcohol in it, and it was so hard to drink, it was insanely sweet.  I should have sent it back, but I felt like I didn't want to be a problem, didn't want spit in my drinks or food, etc.  I drank about half, put a bunch of water and ice in it and gulped down the drink as fast as I could, it was nauseating.   I then ordered a grey goose on the rocks, thinking they couldn't mess that up.  Wrong again... it was definitely not grey goose.  It tasted like lighter fluid.  We were seated outside, which I don't mind due to the heaters, but we had to listen to people honking non stop near the valet while we ate, which everyone outside was complaining about.  Luckily it started at the end of our meal, but it didn't make for a great dining experience.  To top it off, we had left over avocado egg rolls and it really irritates me when they don't pack up the dipping sauce with it.   It's a damn shame when the bread is the best part of the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=440

Seal S.,"West Covina, CA",30,158,15,2.0,5/8/2015,"I had arranged to meet my Mother here to celebrate Mothers Day with lunch and a movie. While waiting for her to show, she called and said she would be a couple of minutes late and that I can order for her. She loves the sweet tamales and I knew that the Cuban rolls that I had last time was no Bueno, so I ordered the Carolina pulled pork sandwich and a endive salad for us to share. It was hard to figure out who was actually helping us. I kind of felt in a no help zone. It took a while to get ANY help. The menu is SO extensive, and full of advertising that I guess I didn't see exactly what I had ordered. It was pork belly. Which I really like, usually. This was kind of undercooked and overcooked also. The bun was good, The sauce was excellent and some of the pork was good. What I didn't care for was the slaw, being on the bacon, on the pork. While the bacon was VERY good, a pork sandwich, is not necessarily in need of bacon. American excess! When I ordered, I told whoever it was that we were going to a movie and while we weren't really rushed, we needed to be expedient. Plus I paid then, so that my Mother wouldn't try to pay. So she cleaned her plate, and I had about 2/3 of my sandwich left. It was obvious we were done. Nobody would stop. I finally asked a waiter for a box, We waited, No box. I asked a waitress for a box, We waited. I told my Mother to prepare to leave, and walked to the front desk and told them of the failure. Then I left. With the tip (which was above the suggestion on the receipt) in my pocket.

Cheesecake Factory offers standard fare that's reliably consistent with a proper chain restaurant.  But why the constant large crowds here, I don't know.  The Arcadia location, huge in its gaudy new glamour, sits off to the side of the Santa Anita Mall.  This location is not quite as crowded as some of the other locations but it sure can get busy especially during the weekends.  My husband is a huge fan of their Farmhouse Cheeseburger ($10.95) topped with pork belly, cheese, and a fried egg!!!  For appetizers the Avocado Eggrolls ($9.95) and Crispy Crab Wontons $9.95 are decent choices.  Their salad portions are huge and you can't really go wrong although you may want to ask for dressing on the side if you don't like it too heavy.  The Chicken Madeira ($16.95) is a very popular dish but personally, I like their Teriyaki Chicken ($15.95); it's simple, tasty and prepared well.  While some may like their pasta, I'm not so fond of over-sauced over-cooked mushy noodles.  The breakfast is solid and I've never tried their steaks and grilled fish.  Sandwiches, tacos, pizzas, burgers, salads, chicken, steak, fish, huge appetizers, fried goodies...you'll be able to find something to eat.  And of course, they have a lengthy selection of cheesecakes to finish off your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=440

I went with a group of church friends and I arrived at around 11:15pm. I know that the place closes at 11:00pm so I wanted to order as soon as we got there, first of all, the waiter didn't even offer drinks. I wanted to get my order in right away so I requested a chicken madeira, a few minutes later the waiter said kitchen was closed and that he could only get us soup or salad. I opted for soup, the guy didn't mention the soup of the day which was lenti soup. I would never pay for lentils, they're so cheap and easy to make. It had bacon and some spice in it that was horrible. If it wasn't for my friend that offered a slice of his pizza I would not have eaten. I understand that the waiter wanted us to leave soon but that does not justify poor service, I didn't get refills on my water and he said that the kitchen was closed for coffee. How long does it take to brew a few cups of coffee? I didn't ask for the kitchen to be reopened but I did want my slice of cheesecake and coffee because I couldnt' eat.

Kathy L.,"El Monte, CA",1,53,63,3.0,7/21/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located at the Santa Anita mall. I came here on Thursday for lunch around 2:30. We did have to wait because it was pretty busy, but it was no more than 10 minutes.  FOOD: I've eaten here a couple times, but this time the food just didn't taste great. I ordered from the lunch specials and got the meatloaf that came with mashed potatoes and corn mixed with vegetables. The meatloaf just didn't cut it for me. I probably enjoyed the corn the most. The portion was very generous though, I expected it to be a lot less than what I was served.  Besides the meatloaf, we ordered two appetizers - tater tots and the fried macaroni. I liked the tater tots, which was filled with bacon, cheese, and green onion. It came with sour cream and sriracha mayo, but I only dipped it with the sriracha mayo since I do not like sour cream. The fried Mac n'cheese wasn't too bad either, I just wished they added a bit more macaroni inside.  SERVICE: service could be better. I don't know if it was because we looked like a bunch of kids or if it's because they put us in a corner, but they could have been more attentive. They probably came to our table only twice besides bringing us our food. We also had to ask our waitress a couple times before we got what we asked for. At the end, she came with the bill and I gave it to her when I was ready, yet when she came back with the receipt, she handed it to my cousin instead. I was kind of taken aback because and confused why she handed it to my cousin instead of me. I'm not trying to make that a big deal because it's not, but was it because I looked to young that you didn't give it to me instead ? Doesn't matter though, but please be more attentive to your customers.  PRICE: I think it is pricey, but its price is comparable to places like BJ's or TGIF.  PARKING: since this is located at a mall, it can be pretty hard to find parking on the weekends, but there is an option if valet service.

Steve S.,"San Gabriel, CA",312,177,412,3.0,9/18/2016,"Ok so this review is going to be honest on our experience as of what we saw, experienced, tasted. I hope there's no character limit as to how much I can write. In all honesty my family and I love Cheesecake Factory but on our visit this latest time we were with friends that just came in to town and I was really disappointed with quite a few things since we love how this place was consistently in the past.  First thing I noticed when we were lead to our table for lunch was the cleanliness of the table and the dishes and silverware. It was like the night crew just used a dirty rag to clean because there was crumbs all over and sticky table. The bread dishes had food stuck on 6 out of 7 dishes, that is bad. I understand 1 or perhaps 2 but 6?! Really was the dish washing machine broken or the dinner crew that slammed the night before that they stacked plates thinking it was clean? The silverware was much better just a few forks were crusted and sticky. I didn't notice what letter grade they received but hopefully not a C.  Now on to the food and drinks which were all very good, with the exception that when a child orders a simple butter Parmesan bow tie pasta you figure it's hard to mess that up, but yep the pasta station messed up in the back, there was a few  green onions that got in and a smudge of marinara sauce that dripped in and got served. Um this would be bad if someone has food allergies with either the ingredients of marinara or green onions, luckily my kid doesn't, but doesn't like either of the accidentally included bonus ingredients. We ended sending it back because what was included was enough to change the flavor of the dish that my child wouldn't eat it. You figure it would be quick to get a fresh one out, um no we were almost all done before it got out to her. Wow that's really amazing.  When we were looking for our waitress the few times we needed help, no where to be found. Waited quite a bit of time. I understand we came at that start of the weekend lunch rush but it's really bad to be not available to your guests, I figure it maybe the decision poor grouping of who takes care of which stations because I didn't see out wait staff really attending anyone else around us. She was pleasant and nice but if she was tasked to help our line table and other tables else where of course I wouldn't assume she's be close to us, she would be all over the place. That is poor management of table groupings for the poor server. The adult drinks were done really well, we had a few between us and our friends and they were all mixed quite solid. The food over all was very good. The other thing I was concerned about was the amount of salt that was used in the French onion soup, wow I used my sandwich to help cut the salt and it balance out better but I just left that ocean in its bowl. I think it was saltier than the Saltons Sea down in imperial county, it was so salty. The salad was good, fresh and tasty. I had the chicken salad sandwich combo with salad and soup.   Over all experience was not what I expected from an older seasoned establishment as this. I hope it was just a one time deal. I will be back again to see if things changed. New edit...9-18-2016 So The mother ship aka corporate reached out and asked me to address my concerns to their corporate site.  will do over and out so I bring back 1 star but I need to send in yet another written letter of addressing my experience? Ok that's a bit much if they can't read my review here and figure something is up. Not being a brat or a complainer but just stating facts of what I experienced and hope the branch fixes it. Last couple times I've been there have been eh just ok not blow my mind wow the experience was awesome. I guess experience goes out the door when you have too many people waiting for a table and you care less. Latest Edit 9-24-2016 Ok guest services addresses me again, glad they are now taking me seriously and taking it internal. After it takes initial and edited post to get it this far wow. People don't think to take it serious after the first review. Uncleanliness is unacceptable period and if it takes 1 review and 1 edit to get it addressed then there is some breakdown in communication. Is my writing too unclear or verbose, I'm not certain but I'll keep it short next time. For all the people out there deserve clean place settings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=40

Vodka, I'll take a million... Ok just one bc it's lunch time. Cheesecake is always good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=40

Leshel C.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,63,35,2.0,7/6/2017,"Whatever happened to the good old customer service at Cheesecake Factory? My family and I been coming to Cheesecake Factory for years now and I have been getting good services except for this one recent visit we had. On July 2 my family and I went to Santa Anita Mall and after shopping my kids said ""Mom, can we have dinner at Cheesecake Factory?"" So I said sure!. We go there and I told the guy table for 4 please and he asked ""Outside or Inside?"" We all decided we wanted to eat outside and he said ok and gave us the buzzer for us to wait and was told 15 minutes wait. So we waited...waited...waited and after 25 mins of waiting our buzzer started buzzing so we gave it to the guy. He took the buzzer from my husband and was told just stay on the side. We waited again bout 5 minutes and finally the girl said ""Let's go this way"". We followed her and she took us to a table which it wasn't outside like we told the guy but we all decided to just take that table because we were all hungry already. Another 5-7 minutes on the table Kalyn took drinks order then she came back with our drinks but without any straws so I asked her if we could have straws and she said ""I'll be back"". She came back with our straws and left right away. So we were waiting and waiting and waited again and hey guess who showed up after minutes of waiting? Yes, Kalyn decided to show up gave us 3 pcs of bread with 4 pcs of butter and took our orders. After she took our orders my daughter asked her if they have some type of wipes or hand sanitizer and she said ""No but we have napkins. Would you like some?"" My daughter said ""Yes, please"". My daughter waited and waited and waited but she never came back. So by this time my head was already pounding from hunger. 25 minutes pass us sitting from our table another family sat by our table. She brought them 4 pcs of bread which they were only 3 but hey that cool by why we only got 3 pcs of bread which there was 4 of us? Anyway, she took their orders. Everyone happened so fast from the table next to us that their food even came first before us. We waited 40 minutes for our food!. So we ate and we ran out of drinks but she didn't come back to us if we needed anything. After we wait we waited and waited and after 10 minutes she showed up and said ""everything ok?"" And my husband was like can we have more soda? And said for here or to go? We said to go cause it might take another 20 minutes. She came back with the soda to go which was only 3/4 she didn't even fill it up. She asked if we want desserts and I said no we will just buy it at the front and she looked at me and gave me a fake smile. So she gave us the check and we gave her 2 Cheesecake Factory gift cards that was given to my kids both $25 each and the rest I told her to put in my debit card. 5 minutes later she came back and told us that one of the card didn't have money and only one went through so I said just use my debit card for the rest so she left. She handed me the gift card that supposedly didn't have any money that she said she ran twice. My husband and I was thinking why wouldn't have the card any money? Anyway, she came back and gave me the receipt that I needed to sign and left. So we got up and decided to get desserts at the front and at the register where I was paying I asked the girl can you try if this gift card would work and she did. After she ran the card and it actually worked and she even said ""You have $7.35 left"" after she charged me with 2 Cheesecakes. So we were all like hmmmm why  did  Kalyn the waitress said there was no money ??? Well, over all we were disappointed that's the bottom line. Customer service needs to get better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=40

Donna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,443,537,2.0,6/3/2017,"American food (pizza, pasta, salad, burgers, steak) that's slightly overpriced with lots of calories, but oooh so good for once in a while right? =) I love the Cheesecake factory for the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic with lots of Parmesan cheese on top, one of the best strawberry lemonades ever, that complimentary brown bread with loads of butter, and of course, the cheesecake! My family came here to celebrate my niece's 2nd birthday and it was an exciting time because this is the very first year she can blow out a candle. We were a party of 8 and very happy to celebrate a milestone. Although the food is great, the service needs improvement. Our server was inattentive with an attitude. The part where she was MIA, took 15 minutes to bring out initial drinks, forgot promised condiments, and left us hanging after everyone finished their meal (waited 15 mins before being able to find her to ask for dessert) wasn't the problem. We figured she was busy and gave her the benefit of the doubt. It was the fact that she refused to refill my lemonade because my boyfriend had a few sips. It's considered ""sharing"" so she would need to charge for a new one. Unbelievable...we were all shocked. The previous 2 refills were majority ice so that was why I kept asking for refills, not because someone else had a few sips. I spoke to the manager and immediately after, our server brought a new cup out and said she didn't want to fight the system over the rule and that it was Friday so she didn't want to fight. None of that made any sense nor was it necessary to share. I'm pretty disappointed and will not be back to this location for another celebration to be spoiled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=40

After 5 minutes, she came with the manager.  He told me that hair that came out from my mouth, was a corn hair.  It doesn't make sense to me, because on my shrimp scampi pasta doesn't have corn at all.  He is trying to make me believe that white hair on the dish comes from corn which the dish has not corn inside!!!!!He expressions was rude.

Jeff L.,"San Marino, CA",131,337,836,5.0,12/18/2016,"What else can be said about The Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said.  The variety is wonderful and you can please all different types of tastes in your party.  Their pastas, pizzas, salads, and lots of other items are all wonderful.  Portions are huge so it's always good to share and try different things.  Here at the Westfield Arcadia, it's usually pretty busy. The Chicken Bellagio is a great dish to have.  Their BBQ chicken ranch salad is great and the different ingredients add a lot of texture to it.   They do have a happy hour here that is kind of on the down low so if you happen to be here during the week in the afternoon, get some cheaper appetizers in the bar area. Their house bread is phenomenal and it's a staple of their restaurant.  Last but not least, the cheesecake is great.  I like trying the seasonal ones to see what is being featured at the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=60

christine c.,"Covina, CA",0,23,6,1.0,12/3/2017,"Came here for my dad's birthday celebration around 530. I was told the wait would be up to 45 minutes for a party of 9. We expected to wait a long time for such a long party but got irritated when we saw multiple parties of 8, who arrived later, get seated before us. When I went to inquire after waiting an hour, the poor attitude from the guy at the host stand was unacceptable. First, insensitively saying we were only there 10 minutes longer then the quoted time - when obviously we had waited for over an hour and not having any reason why at least 3 other later large parties were seated ahead of us. With 3 young kids, waiting an hour is hard enough without dealing with seeing other later parties being seated first and a poor attitude. My husband went to confront the host, who threatened ""I'll take you off this list right now!"" At that point the manager came over to diffuse the situation. We were seated at a table for 8 in the front of the restaurant that stood empty for at at least 15 minutes. I have no problem with waiting but the poor attitude and threat of being taken off the wait list after having been there for an hour was totally inappropriate.

So fk that.  I went to the restroom and saw a lot of empty seats in other areas. I haven't been feeling being treated so shitty since high school. Our waiter (the one chatting behind the desk ealier) was so funny. He asked me what I ordered which was fine but gosh it was the first thing I ordered and I swear I saw he was writing something on that little piece of paper. He was probably just drawing the food I guess and forgot about the first one he drew.   Sent the wrong drinks to us (the 3 drinks was ordered by those people sitting behind us on the bar table. and we don't even have 3 people.    He looks old but not that old okay.

We ordered our ""go to"" dishes, Angel hair pasta with shrimp, firecracker salmon and goat cheese and beet salad.  Let's start with the appetizers. The firecracker salmon was less salmon than firecracker sauce. Lots of shredded cabbage garnish, but only 3 very tiny salmon rolls. Barely a mouthful. Goat cheese and beet salad was light on all the key ingredients, namely the cheese, the beets, walnuts and heavy on the bitter tasting arugula. Lastly, the shrimp and angel hair pasta was super small and overpowered by what tasted like canned tomatoes. I like the portions, quality and ambience of the Pasadena location much better.

I've almost forgotten about how good it was, great comfort food in huge portions! I have always loved their big and vast menu, lots of choices. They now have low calories menu with drinks, tapas and entrees, it's great for light eaters! The cheese cake menu is my favorite, I don't usually eat cheese cake, but I just have to have a slice here! They serve lunch till 5pm everyday, it's good deal, happy hour at bar area from Monday- Friday.  We started with Ahi tartare, it's small plate, tiny portion but very fresh and flavorful. Great with a Stella draft. Hubby had Jambalaya pasta, it's dinner portion only, it was fairly delicious, but not as good as I remembered, the pasta was a little hard and chewy.  I had lemon- herd roasted half chicken, I am PMS so bad, I really had to break my Pescetarian diet for some light meat protein, the chicken is free range all natural organic chicken, so I guess it was OK for me to eat just once. Glad I ordered it, the chicken was sooooo tender, the sauce was very flavorful, I asked our server to bring me some more of it, I almost wanted to ask the recipe, the tender chicken meat with that amazing sauce.... just the type of comfort food I needed! The mashed potato was very light and yummy, it was a good balance with the strong flavored chicken.

Marie T.,"Crestline, CA",2,31,1,4.0,7/23/2016,"I really enjoy Cheese Cake Factory and their menu.  I went to the Arcadia location yesterday evening with my 2 granddaughters. We had been inside the mall and went in and gave our name. It was a 30 minute wait so we said we would sit outside to be seated right away. We did not know that the ashes from the terrible fires were blowing and going into our water, in our hair etc. and making plates dirty. When we asked to be moved ( willing to wait) our waiter Caesar became very annoyed making an uncomfortable situation for us.  I was ready to leave the restaurant because of his poor attitude. I was told they were no longer seating outside because of that issue. Luckily Gabby moved us and was very polite.  There is nothing like good customer service and Gabby made sure we were well taken care of. She made a negative experience into a good one.  She saved the day, that is why I am giving to 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=260
Garen A.,"Montebello, CA",487,679,2009,3.0,8/5/2013,"Cheesecake Factory definitely has one of the most expansive menus around - I mean what don't the serve?? This last time I started with an alcohol infused milkshake (called the Flying Monkey) - it had Godiva Liquor and was actually quite delicious.  We also had the Mac N Cheese Balls (good, but too heavy) and the Avocado EggRolls (I'm not a huge avocado person, but they aren't bad).  I love the Luau Salad here ... it's probably my favorite thing on the menu! We always get that to share with a few friends (the crunchy wonton pieces are worth fighting over).  I decided to try their chicken tacos during my most recent visit - not much of a fan ... they definitely need more flavor to them.  The service is hit or miss ... last time our second waiter (because they always seem to swap waiter shifts when I'm there) was not as attentive as our first - If I've noticed the absence of a waiter for more than 10 minutes, something is wrong.  Also, the lighting at all Cheesecake Factories needs an upgrade ... it's way to dim inside - I can barely read the menu or see my food - both somewhat important parts of my restaurant going experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=260

Wilfred Y.,"New York, NY",323,24,158,4.0,4/21/2015,"I think over the years, Cheesecake factory is trying to reinvent itself to be more health conscious so that is why they creates the light menu? But let's face it, when you decide to go there you know you are adding another hour to your gym routine the next day to weight-lift off the calories from that 2 pound Alfredo pasta or New York Steak. It's a great place for group of friends or family. We always do family style and I love all the appetizers. The sliders are cheezy good and the nacho plate with the same gratuitous amount of melted cheese is equally delicious.  The interior decoration at the Santa Anita mall probably has a more beautiful interior decoration than some of the other locations. But still it has the same gold and yellow art-deco-esque theme, which to me is beginning to get a little old. They might consider to update the look of the restaurant if they want to appeal to the younger or hip crowds. But we mostly do not come here for a posh dining experience.

While the restaurant isn't high end or even considerably fancy, the atmosphere inside does elevate the restaurant to a level above your average chain. We were seated promptly at a cozy booth since there were many empty seats (some hostesses will actually seat a party of 2 at a tiny table when other larger ones are available). Our server (didn't catch his name) was extremely friendly and professional the entire time. I even commented to my date that it was a breath of fresh air having servers who didn't seem to hate you, their jobs and life in general.  Ordered a dirty martini, the grilled pork chop and the chicken madeira. Both dishes were good, nothing mind blowing, and very filling with great portion sizes.

Usually when I come here, I order the factory nachos which are always super decadent. Absolutely delicious.   But my fiancé and I decided to split a dish because the portions are huge, and today, I was craving pasta.  There are so many delicious pasta dishes here so we could've gotten anything, and it'd still be delicious. We finally decided on the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Before we got the food however, we waited a very long time. I guess I'm used to it because the wait always takes really long at Cheesecake Factory, but I wish they could do something about it. We devoured the free bread in the meantime.  When we got our food we saw that it had asparagus, red and yellow peppers, honey-glazed chicken on pasta in a parmesan cream sauce.  I don't understand the reviews claiming this was super heavy, but maybe I was craving something heavy that day.

Jessica T.,"Arcadia, CA",400,170,635,3.0,9/11/2016,"This restaurant is always mediocre at best. I typically come here with family when we have a birthday to celebrate and want to go to somewhere local, semi nice, yet also not too pricey. This is one of those restaurants that reminds me of the high school days, when large groups would go out to eat together before heading to Prom or the Homecoming dances.  My favorite appetizer would have to be the avocado rolls. i normally am not a huge fan of fried foods (especially as appetizers), but it is quite tasty despite being fried on the outside. The sauce complements the avocado very well. Moving on to the main dishes... I highly suggest the miso salmon for the healthy eaters out there. The salmon is cooked perfectly (almost) every time and the sauce is also an A+ with the rice on the bottom (choose brown rice if you want to be extra healthy). But on the days when I'm craving straight up pasta, I like to get the angel hair shrimp, which is just a huge plate of plain old angel hair and shrimp drenched in tomato sauce with a hint of garlic and lemon. The farfalle pasta is also a good option I go to if I'm not in the mood for angel hair. If you want a salad though, I recommend the Asian chicken salad, as it is a HUGE entree and you will most likely not be left hungry after from eating just a salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=80

Weekday happy hour Mon-Fri from 4-6PM. One of the best happy hour joints in the area. Appetizers are $5.95 with other small dishes that are $6-8. And the portion sizes are pretty big. I ordered the happy hour burger and my friend ordered the fried macaroni and cheese. The burger was one of the better burgers I had. Double patty was cooked at a perfect medium rare. The thousand island sauce with the butter toasted buns made this a great burger. The fried macaroni and cheese was good as usual, but they slightly burned the edges.

Two of us ordered breakfast for dinner while one of my friends got Shrimp Scampi.  I have to say, she gave me a shrimp and it had lots of garlic and was amazing.  I would have poached all her shrimp from her plate if I had no self-control, but I did, thanks in part to our basket of fresh bread and butter.   Our breakfast wasn't the best omelette I've ever had (they do the fold the egg over the ingredients method) because I like my egg to be binded to the ingredients almost like a scramble or a tort of sorts.  The bacon in it was incredibly tasty though and it did bump up the flavor of my dish.  Bacon really does make everything better!

Today my co-worker (you're awesome Priscilla!) brought us back two cheesecakes: Pumpkin and Red Velvet Cheesescake. Insanely delicious! I preferred the red velvet over the pumpkin because it actually had cake in between the cheesecake fillings-sooooo good!

However all the servers decided to hang out in one spot and chit chat amongst each other.  My bf sat there with his hand up for awhile and a random chatty server made eye contact with him but decided to ignore him. I finally got a random someone to get us boxes and that's when my bf asked him for the manager. This random employee walked by the chatty group of servers and said something to them, and then they decided to disperse. Their employees are unprofessional and lazy.

Wow the selection of different Cheesecakes where do you even start and how do you just choose one? so instead of one whole cheesecake at $45 - $50,  I chose three slices as follows. Dutch Apple Streusel Cheesecake - $6.95 per slice,     Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake - $6.95 per slice,      Red Velvet Cheesecake - $7.50 per slice,     My Wife said her favorite was the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake, which should be no surprise to me as she's a Pineapple freak!, I thought they were all outstandingly good but would lean towards the Dutch Apple as being the best with the apples, the crumble topping and cheesecake.

I know Americans eat with their eyes, but to most people, it has to taste as good as it looks. I've been disappointed by their food way too many times. I mean, it does look pretty. But yummy food? Methinks not. Last time I was here, I ordered myself a burger, thinking that they can't possibly mess up on a burger right?? Think again! I ordered the factory burger and it came with some super hard french roll. When you bit into the burger, the hard bread squeeze everything to the other side. And the grill onions were the worst grill onions I've ever had in a burger.  I told my friend to get a burger too, he got the Classic burger which was awesome, but they charged $2 to add cheese.

Lauren X.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,365,514,4.0,2/10/2010,"Why does it get 3 stars if most people like this place? Price?  Well, this is the closest to me and I love it! I hate the wait area though, but at least it is bigger than Pasadena where even if  cold you have to wait outside since the seating inside is so limited and everyone hovers by the cake display.  This one at least is more spacious and you can eve bring stroller in..that is how much space there is.  For cheesecake factory: (1) Why not make wait area bigger since cake displays hog up a good amount of space and (2) why don't you have automatic / revolving doors? Your doors are TOO heavy!!  Ok, enough complaining.  Price I don't mind since really it is a 2 portion food you are ordering. I think they are use to boxing things up for you.  The cocktails are good. Mojitos awesome, rasberry martini strong (ask for top shelf if u want stronger), but the flying gorilla, oh my, that is a meal in itself! I would stay away from that or you will need 2 boxes to go.  The regular coffee not good at all. Not strong for price. Specialty coffee like lattes served in huge glass instead of cup. Not bad :D The hot chocolate is heaven!! Meals i love Bang Bang Chicken and Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp (waiter forgot my plaintains and came back with a huge bowl).  Pastas are usually safe and good. I cannot write too much since most food don't stick out as bad. Personally, though, I think their Small Plates and Snacks Menu is a rip off. The cost is high considering the small bites they give. Go for the huge one! Get the full appetizer and take them home too.  For kids, it is wonderful since they give them warm plate of bread and sliced bananas. Thanks! I just had 2 bad experience here where we were seated and when we had to leave unexpectedly after we placed order, the waiter was so mad at boxing up our items since he thought we will not tip him. That attitude served him a fat bagel from us.  The other one was new and was so rude. Did not box our items and worse off, I had no idea how to use their new box and after he smirked at me, he snapped the lid and stared me down like I am stupid as he said, ""there u go. easy as that."" What a f. jerk my husband and I said.  His tip suffered too.   This joint has great and friendly servers overall besides these 2 that are probably not there anymore.  I have no problem with wait time since I go off hours. Love their curb side service although I think they need a better system in locating your car.

Not sure what's that all about.  I ordered the Salisbury steak. The plate had mashed potatoes and some green beans. The sauce on the steak had only a few mushrooms but plenty of onions. Supposedly there was garlic in it. I couldn't really taste it.  Just like any other Cheesdcake Factory, they'll give you bread and butter. It just didn't taste very fresh here like the one in old town. It was harder than what I expected. Especially with the brown bread, it was harder then usual.  The dishes were not cleaned very well.

It turns out that Thursday night is the night to go to this location. We walked in and were seated immediately. Wait? What's that? My wife is, by far, the healthier of the two of us in her eating habits. She ordered the weight management Asian chicken salad and had them add Mandarin oranges. This salad is her regular choice and she enjoys it immensely, especially with the added sweetness of the oranges. I ordered the Memphis burger. Pulled pork, coleslaw, and BBQ sauce on a burger. Basically it amounts to bliss in a bun. The coleslaw is slightly sweet, the BBQ sauce somewhat smokey, the pulled pork flavorful and juicy, the burger cooked to perfection (I like them well done, thank you), and everything together is just plain delicious. The fries were hot and delicious and made perfect vehicles for salt and ranch. The tropical tea is one of the main reasons I come here and it did not disappoint. Our server seemed to be training someone, so things were a bit bumpy there, but noting that caused us to take notice. Overall, an excellent experience.

Will T.,"Torrance, CA",198,95,11,1.0,1/12/2012,"Pro-Tip: There's an additional parking lot in the back that you can park in that's very close to the Cheesecake Factory. If I could leave a 0-star review I would and it's because of the General Manager, Justin Park. I find it very disturbing that someone in charge of the restaurant would be so rude and careless about customer service. I even told him that he should be fired and he agreed with me! I might expect that kind of apathy from a busser, but not the manager. Justin Park's actions were disgusting. I came here with my family (including my wheelchair bound grandmother) for a New Year's dinner. Apparently while I was in the restroom, there was a server switch. What resulted was us not getting service for over 20 minutes. We had to ask random people walking by for utensils and water refills. Finally someone in my family told me what had happened that I was finally able to talk to our new server and get better service.  Before Christmas, my girlfriend and I had also come in and bought a lot of cheesecakes for a Christmas party we were going to. We each decided on a piece that we wanted and took it with us. When we tried to eat it the next day, we noticed that they tasted funny, mostly the whipped cream. I called in and was told that if I brought them back that I could get them exchanged. When I gave them to my server, she was very nice and told me that I would have them waiting for me after dinner. Instead, I got Justin Park. He walked up to our table and stood right over my grandmother and stared down at us. He asked me for my receipt. Unlike him, I do not walk around carrying every receipt that I've ever received. I also doubt that I could have picked up Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes from anywhere else other than the Cheesecake Factory. He told me that he would not be exchanging my cheesecakes. The entire time, he was harassing my grandmother with his presence as I could see her becoming agitated. When I brought the slow service problem to the attention of Justin Park, his simple response was that they had a server switch. No apologies, no explanations. A rude ""this is how it is and that's that"". I exchanged a few more works with him and finally told him to leave so he wouldn't bother my grandmother anymore. I now have a very negative perception of Cheesecake Factory because one manager decided 2 pieces of Cheesecake were worth harassing a family over. I tipped more to my server than the value of those 2 pieces of cake. JUSTIN PARK SHOULD BE FIRED!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=680

Michael W.,"Omaha, NE",8,43,4,3.0,5/3/2009,"This was only my second visit to this chain.  It would have been my third, but the last time I tried to visit it was ridiculously crowded and I wasn't up to waiting a long time for lunch. It wasn't nearly as busy as I thought it would be today for lunch on a Sunday.  My wait was about 5 minutes.  Once seated, I had to wait a few minutes for my waiter to appear.  Once he showed, the service was great.   I ordered the Renee's Special, which is a sandwich, cup of soup, and salad.  I picked the chicken salad sandwich and it was tasty, though a bit greasy with too much mayo.  The soup today was some type of creamy broccoli.  It was a bit bland, and definitely not something I'd order again.  I spent an extra dollar and upgraded the salad to a caesar.  It was good, but nothing special.   The special was one of the cheapest things I saw on the menu, excluding appetizers.  Combined with an iced tea, I spent $15 before tip.  I would probably return if I happened to be hungry while I'm at the mall, but I wouldn't make a trip to the mall just to eat here as parking is usually horrific. I also second what someone else mentioned concerning the cheesecake.  If you want some, I'd recommend buying the entire cake.  One slice that I purchased to take home ran me $8.  The entire cake would be far more economical.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=680
Ray W.,"San Dimas, CA",4,4,,1.0,10/31/2014,"It's been a few years since I ate at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant, because the last time I found a dead fly in my salad at the one in Brentwood, which is now closed. Two days ago I visited the Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia and ordered my favorite Shrimp Pasta. I was stunt that the shrimp in the pasta was less than the size of a quarter. What happened to the jumbo shrimps I used to enjoy so much time after time? I've had delicious finger size shrimps so many times before for about $17 in many Cheesecake Factories. Now it's still about the same price but the shrimps are so tiny and the quality has done down the toilet. It will be a while before I will eat at another Cheesecake Factory again.

We ordered a snack too, which was deep fried mushroom, avocado and cucumber. They provided mayonnaise and thousand island sauce on the side. The coat was crispy while it could keep its ingredients juicy inside. I like it a lot. I recommand the avocado with the mayonnaise instead of the thousand island sauce. They were more matched with each other. The waitress was friendly. She knew how to please customers by adding positive comments on what we ordered. Smile was always on her face. Just a little picky point was that, T the front desk was a bit messy. We were given a pager when we checked in. After the pager vibrated, we gave it to the staff. She told us to go to the left with a hand sign. We thought we could get in and get the table that was cleared. At last, we found out that we should wait for another staff to call our names, and lead us to the table. I was a first comer, so the regulation is quite unclear to me.

I always order mine as rare as possible. (i'm a sashimi fan) and i've never been disappointed with it.    The brown bread they serve with butter is by far my favorite. soooo good. Sometimes i'm tempted to go there and just eat bread. The cheesecakes they serve are numerous and all very good.  My favorite is the white chocolate raspberry truffle.  oh my gosh!  You cannot go wrong with that. It's a bit expensive but the slices are quite big, I rarely finish mine despite the fact that it's so good.  The best thing about this location is that Christine works here.  What an awesome server!  She always remembers me when i come in and she greets me and my guests even when we're not seated in her section.  She's constantly smiling and pleasant to chat with and she's attentive and expeditious with the order.  She knows i love the bread and she always brings me all brown bread with extra butter.

Service varies but we usually get a decent waiter---on a few rare occasions we've gotten some strugglers, but mostly some good folks. Not a big fan of their Sunday brunch menu but I do love their lunch/dinner. Usually chicken marsala is my go-to dish but I've sampled alot of their menu. Their salmon has recently been one of my faves, it's always cooked to perfection when I've ordered it. Be prepared to spend some money here, it's not cheap---maybe if you order their lunch specials but even then including drinks you won't be paying $10 bucks---but usually I don't mind because the food delivers for me as well as their desserts. Yes, most of the time there is a wait especially in the evenings/weekends.

Their drinks are pretty stylish too - even the lemonade I got had sugar on the rim.  Now I'm not exactly what you'd call high class, but if they go through the trouble of putting sugar on the rim as if it were some fancy cocktail ... let's just say I know posh when I see it.  Just kidding.  Cheesecake Factory's not posh.  It's just great if you want something substantial to eat that you probably have to get a box for after you're done mauling it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=800

Ah, The Cheesecake Factory. You know, I actually used to like this place. Their appetizers are tasty, and there's such great variety in the menu that everyone can be satisfied even if they want very different cuisines.  Or so I thought. I came to the Arcadia branch not long after it opened because I was craving cheesecake and the jambalaya pasta. My favorite dish here, by far.  I remembered the pasta to have such an abundance of flavor and just the right amount of spice to make me fall in love after one bite, the first time around. (this was at the Grove location fyi) But I ordered it here and it was BLAND.  I couldn't believe it.  My favorite dish, stripped of its aroma, became just another untouched dish of pasta.  It was so bad that finally we bit the bullet and asked the waitress to take it back and fix it.  The chef was nice enough to concoct some more of the jambalaya sauce and brought that out to us to mix into the pasta, after which it started tasting more like it should.  But I do NOT have dulled taste buds!  In fact, most of the time I think there's too much salt in things.  I was definitely not imagining the subpar rendition of the Cheesecake Factory's menu here at this so-called restaurant.  To top it off, the fries were bad too!

For some reason he wouldn't back down on all the excuses I gave him. I needed to shop to get a dress for the Elevate event. I didn't want to come in board shorts, although I would definitely prefer that first.   Since I was already at the mall the first place I thought of was Cheesecake factory. I have gone to the Pasadena locations plenty of times. But it was my first time visiting Cheesecake in Arcadia. So as i walked in we were greeted with two smiling faces. We were seated immediately in the tinyest booth in the world. I hate those booths that cheesecake has. I'm not a big girl and well I felt like I was playing elbow games with the wall. Not feeling too comfortable we asked our waitress if we could switch booth and well she was really nice about it. So we went to the regular size booths and we sat comfortably. YEAH!   I wasn't really too hungry. I had the blt salad. I really like that for some reason. And we had bread. My friend had a salad as well. Oh how can I forget ordering soup. I ordered clam chowder. I have been craving for that lately. It tasted like any other clam chowder. I really love canned clam chowder it does not do me wrong. ha ha. That's the beauty of clam chowder.   No matter where I get my BLT salad its always going to be the same right? Of course how can you go wrong with lettuce, bacon and tomatoes? That's so simple right? YUP and that's exactly what I got. Simple just the way I like things.  Ended the meal well. Just sit and chit chat about the day. Bought a dress wasn't really too excited about it but its a dress at least. I reallly like this cheesecake though. Its not as crowded and its nice to enjoy a meal not feeling like your table is practically connected with some stranger.    4 stars for the service and the cleaniness. O and for the awesome salad.

Jenn C.,"El Monte, CA",57,4,,1.0,9/1/2014,"i have never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory before, and in fact, we have dine here quite often.  last night, i went there for dinner with my boyfriend. i had no problem with my order but my boyfriend found a long white thick piece of paper in his fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. the paper was about 6inch long. we immediately sent the dish back and the manager came by to explain where the paper came from. she said, the pastas had those papers in between to keep them separated and sometimes those papers get stuck with the pasta and the cooks forget to remove them. my boyfriend did not want the same dish anymore so he switched his order to steak Dianne. when they delivered the dish, they didn't even bring a steak knife or offered him if he wanted steak sauce.  although the staffs were apologetic about this matter, we left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied. we were really nice about the whole matter and did not make a scene about it. although we were not charged for the fettuccine alfredo, we were charged for the steak he ordered. i felt as though, they should not even charged him for the steak because they had ruined our appetite.  they did not even offer us dessert on the house. thumbs down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=800
Frank K.,"Boston, MA",135,190,1,4.0,3/12/2007,"You're probably wondering...why am I reviewing the Cheesecake Factory? In fact, why am I reviewing the Cheesecake Factory in Arcadia when I, a HB resident, live near one only two minutes away? This one, that one, they're all the same...so...without further ado: I only stopped by for a martini, apparently a martini that even the Abbey, the manufacturer of all things -tini, can't get quite right. It was the key lime! I couldn't taste the martini at all, extra fruity is always a plus for an alcohol-loving but sensitve to the taste kind of guy like myself. Just the wonderful fruitiness burning my nose! Yum! I was pleasantly surprised as you could tell. And their chocolate mousse cheesecake was great, too. Very rich. I just wanted to let any Cheesecake Factory loving Yelper know that if you're feeling the thirst for a nice cocktail while dining here, order the key lime! Maybe you like stronger taste in alcohol, but for those with a sensitive appreciation for alcohol (aka lightweights), try it.

Tiffany Y.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",462,129,568,3.0,1/24/2010,"This use to be one of my favorite spots. Until tonight. Dundundunnn. Walked in. Waited in a pretty damn long line to get one of those nifty beeper thingys. Host told us ""Mmm about 30-35 mins."" Ok, cool. Not bad for a crowded night like tonight. Tick tock. Fam bam (grandma + aunt) & I waited. And waited. And waited... for a hour and half. Fed up, we got up to complain, but waddaya know? The lil beeper starts beepbeeping and vibrating. Thank goodness. Sat at a booth. I know about the specials the waiter/waitress has to say before saying anything else. But it's always nice to be reminded. But not with this waitress. It went a little like this... ""Just to let you know we AHYADDAYADDAYADDAFISHYADDAYADDASALADYADDABLAH if you have any questions let me know."" Uh, saywut? On to the foooood. Ordered my usual. Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms. Grandma had no idea what was on the menu so she ordered the Grilled Chicken + Avocado Club. Aunt got the Garlic noodles by itself (Chicken & shrimp are optional. Additional costs.) Got a glass of Strawberry Lemonade as well. Before today & a month ago when I was here with my bf, anything I ordered here was MMMouthgasmic. When I came here with my boyfraaand about last month, it wasnt that yummy but I thought it was cause I wasn't all that hungry. But today proved me wrong. Same taste. BLAND. Its not as delicious as it use to be. I dont know if they've been noticing the ""obese"" kids, or they're watching their own diet, but c'mon! My dish tasted like there was no season in it at all. Wheres the marsala wine? Jeez. & my family are already on a loooow-sodium diet due to health problems. Sigh. And when my strawberry lemonade was almost emptied, I left it near the edge of the table so our waitress could see it. & she did. But I wasnt able to see her take my cup & leave. Just like her intro in the beginning, she snatched my cup away before I could blink. Snatched! And i'll assume she mumbled ""I'll be back with your drink."" Or something similar. Eh. The sandwich my grandma ordered, was pretty yum. But seriously. Its only a chicken+avocado club. I can make that easy peasy at home. I didnt try the dish my aunt ordered, but I saw that she had to add salt to it. My grandma didnt like it. TASTELESSSS. My strawberry lemonade was ok. A little too soury, then a little too sweet. My grandma & aunt liked it. My grandma isnt a fan of sweet or sour things, but she kept stealing a few sips here and there. I guess that says something. Check came to about $60 with tip. Not too bad. Service was ok today. Food.... eh. Not so sure about that. Love the 2 types of bread they give you before your orders come. Sad. Paid $60 for ehh-quality food. But the free bread, DELISH! nomnomnom :3 The next time I come here... i'll be going next door. Woodranch Grill. OOOHMAMMA!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=840

Kevin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",367,281,548,4.0,1/16/2009,"I like the Cheesecake factory. I sometimes feel that this restaurant has become our ""safety net"". My gf and I are very indecisive eaters. We can literally spend an hour talking about where we want to eat. We spend so much time trying to decide on where to eat that we are eventually no longer hungry (no joke). In these times of uncertainty, we turn to The Cheesecake Factory. We are rarely disappointed and almost always satisfied. The menu is so big that we literally order something different each time we come. Here are the things that we've tried that stood out to me: Platinum Mohito, Avocado Eggrolls, Chicken Medeira, Pasta Da Vinci, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Orange Chicken, Pistachio Cheesecake, and Blueberry-White Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake.   The Mohito is nice and refreshing for those that like to order alcohol with their meals.  The avocado eggrolls are listed under the appetizers, but for a meal for two, it can really serve as an entree.  For avocado-lovers, these eggrolls are stuffed with it.  The chicken medeira is a classic dish here, and probably a popular one too, and is good if you're looking for a good chicken dish (comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus).  The Pasta Da Vinci and the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta are my two faves within their choices for pastas, both tasty, although the jambalaya comes with shrimp and is a little bit on the spicier side.  Just recently, we had a craving for orange chicken, and could not think of any other place to go for it.  The orange chicken here is different.. we were expecting it to taste like the one similar to Panda Express, but were pleasantly surprised.  The chicken pieces were bigger, and the orange-tasting coating had a slight hint of wasabi to it.  Definitely unique in taste.   Of course, The Cheesecake Factory is obviously known for their cheesecakes.  Of the ones we've tried, definitely go with the pistachio or the blueberry white chocolate truffle.  These are both not on the menu, and were ""specialty"" items that the waiter had told us about when we ordered.  But definitely ask about them, because you cant go wrong with these (the blueberry is my personal fave). The portions are pretty big but we always find room for dessert.   As usual, even with two entrees each we always have leftovers, so we've started to order an appetizer and an entree when it's just the two of us.  If you're looking for variety, come here.  You cant really go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=840
Kimberly O.,"Pasadena, CA",3,8,,1.0,6/24/2008,"Last Friday I attempted the Cheesecake Factory once more.  Once again I found ridiculous portions trying to mask the meritocracy of the food.   However, this time was a bit different then my initial visit.  We did not have to wait to be seated.  We had a party of seven, and all but one of our plates were received in a timely matter.  (The last came after everyone else had finished eating....they did comp this meal)  This was a bit of an improvement. Then it hit, about two hours later.  I had the chicken baja tacos.  I was the only one in my party to eat chicken.  OMG!   Severe stomach cramps.  SEVERE!   Followed by the next 24 hours of camping my butt on the toilet with a garbage can between my knees.   I am writing this review four days later, and I still can not keep solid food down.  The doctor stated that it could take as long as 10 days.  I recently had mono, lost a bit of weight, but the cheesecake factory takes the gold metal for a drastic drop in pounds.   This establishment is not tasty enough to take a chance.  It is an over rated chain.  Nothing better then TGIF's, Applebees, etc.   If you are looking for mediocre, try something cheaper with better food quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arcadia?start=840
