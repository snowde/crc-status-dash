He was a dynamic server with great conversation. His dinner and drinks recommendations were on point and delicious.  Please try the new Celebration Cheesecake!

Jessica D.,"Waldorf, MD",73,5,8,2.0,1/7/2018,"The experience today (Sunday) for brunch, was not so good. The service was okay, but she talked way too much. She also talked about the people she was serving who sat at the table next to us because they didn't eat meat. She went on and on about them not eating meet and they could clearly hear her.  I had to ask for the free bread that they give out, twice. When our food came, both my potatoes and my husband's were burnt. I asked the waitress about them and she said that they were supposed to be that way. See pictures. I unfortunately will not be back here. ALSO, I called the manager over to our table to tell him about the burnt potatoes, and he looked at them with a blank stare, stupid, almost dumb look in his face and just said ""okay"". He did take an entire off my bill though. Still wouldn't come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington
Matthew S.,"Clearwater Beach, FL",0,30,3,2.0,9/17/2017,"Oh! How the mighty have fallen. When Cheesecake Factory first started,  it was a unique and mildly exotic dining experience,  with a diverse and eclectic menu.  Along the way,  they over expanded and have lost quality control.  The items are exotic if not slightly overpriced,  but they don't deliver like they previously did. In the last month, I have eaten (dine is too charitable ) at 2 CF locations. One had poor service and ridiculously undersized portions. But this location took the cheesecake!  We ordered a hamburger,  that in a previous life, had been the sole of a shoe.   The accompanying fries were cold.   Our salads were ok, ok being the highlight of the experience.  The waitress disappeared,  did not check on the progress of our meal, and when she did return ro begin clearing the table,  we were treated to an overpowering smell of cigarette smoke.  Disgusting!  We paid the tab, but before we left, I had one more entertaining experience.  The men's room was filthy,  floor and other surfaces, details omitted in the interest of good taste. I told the manager who shrugged,  so I  added that even gas stations laugh at this place.  It all bespeaks a lack if attention to the details that enhance a dining experience.  Since Cheesecake Factory is 0 for 2 at two separate locations,  I can only conclude that their expansion has outpaced their commitment to quality.  The experience is no longer new, and if it doesn't remain consistent,  maybe it is time to move on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington
Sarah M.,"Washington, DC",23,76,64,3.0,8/25/2017,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factory's over the years.  But this is the only one that didn't have a wait on a Friday night at 7pm for a table.  And now I know why - the front side of the house/service is a sloppy mess.   The food though is typical of Cheesecake Factory with a few subpar notes: the bread basket came out room temperature instead of warm like it should be.  The salad was over dressed.  And the edamame we ordered looked wilted and like it had been nuked in the microwave shortly before being brought to our table (something tells me that's exactly what happened).  Not the best food I've had from a Cheesecake Factory in other words, but not terrible. This location earned its three stars for the slow service (20 minutes to get a check after we'd asked for one for example).  But the worst part was they sat us at a dirty table that hadn't been wiped down from the last customers.  I asked to be seated someplace else as it was clearly and visibly dirty.  They didn't accommodate us despite many open tables (????!!!). Instead, after standing around for a while, the hostess got a paper towel and did a half-hearted job smearing around crumbs and chocolate on the seats and then walking off without a word.  I spent the next five minutes cleaning the table myself with a napkin.  So after cleaning my own table I then got to pay $20 for a tuna salad.  Something about that felt deeply, deeply wrong.   Bottom line, there are so many places to eat in Clarendon, and I love Cheesecake Factory in general, but this location is not up to par.  I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington

Elle F.,"Riverview, FL",0,9,3,2.0,1/1/2018,"We were seated for two right when we walked in. Our server was prompt to provide us water. She came back in a few minutes to take our drink & appetizer order. After that, everything else was down hill. I ordered the Korean cauliflower bites, which were sponged in days old oil tastes like. You can stick your fork in it & see the oil surface from the outside bc it was so oily. Took two bites & couldn't finish the rest. My main course Evelyn's pasta had very very little sauce, the pasta wasn't fully cooked & tasted like it was under a heating lamp after waiting to be served. The vegetables of broccoli was a full small floret that weren't even cut down. The other side dishes we had was white rice & plantains & roasted  asparagus. The white rice was also still hard, the order of 6-8 asparagus I had were completely wilted & dry. The plantains were barely warm. The best things we had were our drinks sadly.

Amanda J.,"Washington, DC",1441,892,308,3.0,8/17/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is pretty standard across the chain.  This one happens to be conveniently located on the orange line outside of D.C., which is a bonus. I come to the Cheesecake Factory once a year, for National Cheesecake day.  For $3.89, I get a nice slice of cheesecake, and I get to hang out with a friend.  This year, I went with one of my favorites, the fresh banana cream.  It's less sweet than most cheesecakes, and it has fruit so it's healthy, right?  I also grabbed a small plate to munch on, and it was the truffle-bacon grilled cheese sticks ($6).  It was a very rich grilled cheese cut up into four sticks, and it was good too.  Due to the richness, I would recommend splitting it, which we found to be perfect. Our server was abrupt, but I made it clear that we were just there for cheesecake.  I didn't want him to waste his time, but a little service is always nice. All in all, a pretty standard place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington
Candis M.,"Alexandria, VA",184,96,83,3.0,9/27/2017,"Decent Cheesecake location. Most of the food and service is to be expected of the Cheesecake standard. I've been here about 5 times and of that 5 times, I had a not so fabulous experience about 2.5 times. One one occasion, my food didn't come out at all. My dining partners were 3/4 way done by the time my food came. This is with the manager on notice. Maybe it wasn't put in? Maybe the runners made a mistake? I'll never know. On two other occasions, I found my dishes to be under-salted. A bit bland actually... which is so not Cheesecake Factory. Also, Every time I've ordered Cheesecake from here, it's been excellent. I'll still continue to come to this location.. Like I said. It's a decent location and it's also closest to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington
Carrie C.,"Arlington, VA",0,2,,1.0,1/13/2018,"Worst customer service experience I have ever had in any establishment. First, at the hostess stand, we were hardly acknowledged at our arrival. Then, numerous people who arrived after us were seated before us. Just wait, it gets even better. When we were the last set of people waiting, one host looked at our ticket, then proceeded to put our seating ticket back down and pretended to work on the computer. Finally after a few more minutes of waiting, we were seated. Once seated, we sat at the table for 10 minutes while at least 5 different servers walked by and not even look at our table or let alone smile at anyone. When the time hit 10 minutes of no acknowledgement again, we put on our coats and started to head out. That is when I guess a guy named Richard, who was supposed to be our server, finally arrived. We would've been willing to stay but when he asked why we were leaving and we told him, his repsonse was I just got here to work. I'm sorry, but no free appetizer is worth how we were ignored. Also, the menus were disgusting. Many of the pages were covered in food and stuck together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington
Theresa B.,"Virginia Square, Arlington, VA",487,303,441,5.0,7/30/2017,"REVIEW OF CHEESECAKE ONLY Ah, another place I only order from when drunk. To be clear, this is probably not a restaurant I would ever actually go to. My experience with this location has been limited to non-sober Postmates experiences only. That being said, they're named The Cheesecake Factory for a reason - it's because their cheesecake is phenomenal and they goddamn know it.  Cheesecakes I have tried:  ~ Fresh banana cream: perfect ~ Lemon meringue: perfect ~ Chocolate hazelnut crunch (with hot fudge): perfect ~ Godiva chocolate cheesecake: perfect ~ Tiramisu: perfect ~ Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple: perfect, although if I remember correctly, this is one of the highest in calories ~ Key lime: good ~ Mango key lime: kind of weird. It had an unpleasant gelatinous texture that cheesecake just shouldn't have. I still ate it, but it was definitely my least favorite. ~ Dutch apple caramel streusel: they've been out of this every time I've tried to order it so probably just don't bother. In summation, for cheesecake-based review only, I'm gonna have to go with a 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington
Allison C.,"Glen Allen, VA",87,285,304,3.0,2/12/2017,"I hate to say it but this is probably one of the worst Cheesecake Factory experiences I've ever had.... We got to the restaurant and there was no wait (wonderful)! I ordered coffee and was asked if I wanted cream... Of course! When the coffee was served, I was not given any sugar (no problem, I'll just ask)!  Asked for sugar and it literally took 5 minutes for it to be brought to the table. Keep in mind, the restaurant was no where close to being full.  My fiancé ordered pancakes, eggs with a little bit of cheese, bacon, and a side of breakfast potatoes.  Again, barely anyone in the restaurant for Sunday brunch at this point. The person accidentally swapped the meal of my fiancé and another patron. Unfortunately she did not order cheese on his eggs and he did. Her meal was sent back and so was his. It took 5 minutes (literally) to bring his plate back out. There was a huge thick slice of cheese laying across his eggs. Mind you he asked for a little bit of cheese. They put his plate in the microwave so now his pancakes were hard on the ends (yuck).  If that wasn't bad enough.... There was a mix up with the cheese on the eggs, once that was corrected he was STILL waiting on his potatoes. By the time he received his meal in its entirety, I was all done eating.  Talk about a terrible dining expedience. Will not be revisiting this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington
Alison V.,"Springfield, VA",453,51,200,5.0,7/16/2017,"I am literally baffled by the sub-par reviews. What's not to like? The large portions? Oh; how I hate having leftovers that I can eat later! Just terrible! Consistency with the taste of the food; ugh, awful idea! An extensive menu; how dare you offer me choices!  I heart Cheesecake Factory; if it was closer, I would be quite overweight (and enjoying gaining each pound, lol).  Our service was great. We had a personable and attentive waitress.  She was responsive to our needs and didn't check in too much (which annoys me) and she wasn't absent either.  The bread - It is so good! We (my husband and I) prefer the brown bread smothered in oh so delicious butter. Can you say yum?!  We started off with the egg roll  sampler (avocado egg rolls, Tex Mex egg rolls, crispy Cuban egg rolls and firecracker salmon egg rolls). Aaaaagh! So good.  So good (also, too hungry), I forgot to take a picture! These were all very good, crispy with good dipping sauces.  We already talked about getting this again one day. Hahaha, I know we are already planning for future meals!  For my entree, I ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano.  One word-Bodacious! I was going to say delicious, but I think I used that adjective earlier, lol.  I love this meal and the hearty portion. My husband got the Pasta Da Vinci.  Also, delicious and a must try.

The size of the menu is so overwhelming and 2. The food spreads across so many cuisines, I've never been able to find anything incredible on the menu.  My boyfriend and I had a couple gift cards so we came here for dinner recently and had a good experience. The waitress was quick to bring bread and fill up our waters. I ordered a Beet Salad (which was OK.... lacking in flavor) and the Tuna Tartare (which I enjoyed, but was a little on the salty side).

I am traveling this week and there is a Cheesecake Factory within walking distance to my hotel. I had the Calamari for an appetizer. It was lightly breaded and fried to perfection, very tasty. My main course was a rib eye steak with veggies. the steak was cooked as ordered and tasty. The mashed potatoes were mashed with small chunks of potatoes, good, I enjoy a more rustic type of mashed potato, this is how I would have cooked them at home. I t also proves that they did not come out of a box. They also threatened me with broccli as the second veggie. The Lord protected me by having them bring out green beans instead. A great change.

Chad H.,"Arlington, VA",139,304,601,3.0,9/26/2016,"I came here for lunch and ordered the crusted chicken Romano. It came with angel hair pasta and a light tomato sauce. I was not too impressed. The chicken lacked some flavor and there were a few pieces of undercooked pasta in my plate. I've been to other Cheesecake Factories before and have been very pleased when I ordered the chicken tostadas salad. This is why I usually just stick with what I know is good. They bring out white bread and pumpernickel bread which is addicting. I ate a little bit too much of that before my main dish. The chocolate cake for desert  was delicious, so no complaints there.  The waitress was on top of her game. She provided refills on my water regularly and refilled the bread frequently. I'm not too sure why they have so-called ""lunch specials"". There is nothing special about spending $17 on undercooked pasta and flavorless chicken. In addition, the presentation wasn't great. My chicken was hidden underneath the pasta. I give them 3 stars cause of my previous positive experiences, but they are going to have to take their game up to another level if they want to keep me as a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington

Can't speak for service too much but the Take out person was very kind and prompt. I suggest ordering it yourself and picking it up over using an app like Post mates, because I've had bad experiences with them with not bringing the whole order, but not sure if that's an issue with the driver or the restaurant. Even the skinnylicious sizes of the salads are freaking huge but they have some amazing Caesar dressing and croutons. I also have tried their skinnylicious turkey and avocado sandwich, which was good but the brioche bun seems a bit unhealthy. I would love this same sandwich on a wrap or something healthier instead.

Lauren B.,"Washington, DC",122,309,737,4.0,1/22/2015,"It had been awhile since I had been to the Cheesecake Factory and it was my first time visiting the Clarendon location. Overall, we had a great meal with good food and service. We were there for a very late lunch/early dinner on a Saturday afternoon, so while there was a 20 minute wait to sit in a booth, there was no wait to sit at a table. Considering we were starving, we opted for a table. During our time dining, it was the middle of a shift change, but unlike other restaurants where you don't end up seeing either of your servers, at Cheesecake Factory, that wasn't the case as both of our friendly waitresses were attentive and kept coming by to check on us. Also, I don't know if I've just never noticed the music playlist before (because usually the restaurant is packed and super noisy), but honestly, it sounded like I was listening to my own iTunes playlist, can't beat perfectly curated music to accompany dining.  Our waitress gladly fulfilled our request to have two loaves of the pumpernickel bread, rather than have one of each. It had been such a long time since I had been to The Cheesecake Factory that it was nice to be able to order some of my old staples and have them taste just the way I wanted them to. I ordered the Raspberry Lemonade - super sweet with a sugared rim, one of my favorites and the crusted chicken romano. I was surprised that this Cheesecake Factory didn't come by and ask if I wanted freshly grated parmesan cheese on my pasta like all the other locations used to do, but there was some cheese already on the pasta so it wasn't a big deal. The one disappointment was I ordered the Reese's Peanut Butter Cake Cheesecake. There were supposed to be chunks of peanut butter cups in the layer of original cheesecake, but my piece didn't have a single peanut butter cup, which kind of defeated the purpose of me ordering this cheesecake because it was supposed to have cheesecake. I reached out to Cheesecake Factory via the guest comment portion of their website just to let them know that the cheesecake they were serving didn't match the description online and suggested they change the name if it wasn't going to include peanut butter cups. While the cheesecake was good, it just wasn't what I had ordered. I was extremely surprised when I checked my mailbox and found they had responded with a letter and sent me a gift card to come back.

The service is kinda slow, but the waiter to table ratio isn't too good so it's understandable in my opinion. The lighting is a bit too dark for my taste though...kind of annoying. But yeah back to the cheesecakes. I mean they're all good, but like I said, they can be really filling...and I advise you to stop eating when your stomach tells you to stop. If you overeat the cheesecake the ""fillingness"" and richness of the cheesecake will DESTROY you and cause to you to vow to never come here again. Do yourself a favor and take it to go. It's best to be enjoyed when you haven't had it within the past 24 or so hours. What took off a star was the price of the cheesecakes. I think 8 dollars for a slice is simply outrageous. if they lowered it to 6 then I'd be fine but 8's just too much. Here are a few pics. I know the blurry one is Chris's outrageous cheesecake and the red/white one is the red velvet one. I think the other one is the snickers one. All in all would go again...if attending a b-day party or it was half-price off cheesecakes again, haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=80
Curtis H.,"Denver, CO",43,250,301,4.0,3/22/2015,"I hesitated when giving the starred rating on this one. Our server, Kayla, was really sweet, though it seemed like she was in the ""weeds.""  Again really nice, but seemed to get stuck on one table and neglect her others. I ordered a Cuban sandwich and my wife, a pit beef.... But don't call her that... You might get punched! :)  Both of the sammies were awesome! Full of flavor, on crusty bread. We decided that e wanted a coke halfway through our meal. Our waitress was nowhere  to be found, so I ordered from the bar. Thankfully, we weren't charged for it.  Our waitress came back, just in time to give us the check, then disappeared again. I think that her coworkers knew she was having trouble, because about 3 other servers came out of nowhere to help pick up the slack. One took our card and processed it, others helped others helped other tables. We were putting on our jackets to leave.... Poor thing looked a little shell shocked. I do commend the factory for ensuring that it's guests were taken care of, but it seemed that there could've been another server or two in the bar section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=80

I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory and pretty much everything they offer and my last visit was nothing different. We were there on a weekday evening, we didn't need to wait, but for weekends there will be a very long wait- and no you can't make reservations.  We were sat and our waiter quickly asked us for our drink order, and promptly brought them to us. We started off with the fried zucchini, yum, one of my fav appetizers they have, it's simple and delicious. We then ordered the Parmesan herb crusted chicken and the chicken costoletta. Both were served hot and were delicious! Cheesecake Factory has very large portions, for a pretty decent price, so plan on taking a box home!.. you need to save room for desert!  For desert we had the red velvet cheesecake and Linda's fudge cake...drool, both were very good.  The food was great, but what really made this visit for us was our waiter, Eliezer. Seriously if you go to this location, ask for him. he was on top of everything and SO polite. He definitely gets my favorite server of the month lol.

On one occasion, my vegan dining guest asked for recommendations from our waiter. He acted like he'd never heard the word before, and then after we spent some time explaining it, he dismissively said, ""Uh, we got a veggie burger."" In the same visit, the waiter came up to me as I was going to the rest room and said, ""hey, we don't have the Blue Moon you ordered. You want anything else?"" No apology.

The lines to be seated are long, the food is mediocre and the service is meh. We stopped in for coffee and dessert after a 15 minute wait for a table. We were escorted to a table in the back of the restaurant behind a server station. This station was loud and served as a central place for the server's to congregate and socialize. Needless to say it was very loud. Our server was inattentive. In fact, it took over 10 minutes before he welcomed us and asked for our drink order. He was also slow with the drink order delivery.    The menu is expansive and they offered 20+ cheesecakes PLUS other desserts as well. We ordered three cheesecakes: Key lime, tiramisu and original, a smores cake and a milkshake. They were delicious. The milkshake, my favorite, was perfect -- not too thick and well made with good quality ice cream and a perfect blend of milk. The cheesecakes were also good so quality was not a problem.

I usually shy away from large chain restaurants but if I had to pick one, the Cheesecake Factory would be the one. This location looks exactly like every other location I have been to, very grand and open. Reminds me restaurants in Vegas. I have yet to have a bad meal at this restaurant, everything I have tried has always been good. A lot of people are hating because of long wait times, but that's a given with any popular place regardless of it being a chain or not, especially on the weekends. The portions here are huge, I can normally eat half and save the rest for another meal later. So if you think about it that way its not that expensive at all. The service has always been good as well, if they ever make a mistake they will do what they can to accommodate your requests.  My favorite cheesecake is the Dulce de Leche, OH MY.

Anthony T.,"Aberdeen Township, NJ",117,152,57,3.0,1/31/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has perfected its niche of ultra-efficient, semi-casual, hugely-portioned food and the Clarendon location is consistent with other Cheesecake Factories I've visited. The service is attentive and welcoming, the food portions are rightfully ginormous, and the atmosphere is a mix of the after-dinner crowd, birthday party, and family of four. But consistency isn't always the best thing. Cheesecake Factory's food always tends to be a bit...much. Whether it's size, seasoning, or flavor, the food isn't up to par with smaller establishments. This time around, I ordered Godiva Cheesecake on our server's recommendation for something chocolate. The chocolate was overpoweringly rich, cloyingly sweet, and paired inexplicably with two mountains of whipped cream. Not to say it didn't meet expectations for ""chocolate"", but the cheesecake itself just felt a bit much. Perhaps what separates Cheesecake Factory from other restaurants is subtlety in the dishes it creates.

Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",301,735,898,3.0,12/9/2014,"How I heard of this place: Introduced by my sister, we never fail to return. Type of cuisine: A typical corporate-style chain establishment, with a variety of options including pizzas, salads, burgers, and pastas in flavors inspired by Mexico, Italy, North America,and beyond. Ambiance: A large establishment, with high ceilings, yellowed walls and decorative glass light fixtures, both hanging from the ceiling and on the walls. Dark brown, wooden backed booths and chair-table seating (in the bar as well) can be found throughout the small spaces created in the venue. Music plays in the background on this evening, sometimes loudly, as the hustle and bustle of restaurant spaces can be heard and felt. Patrons are not shy to speak to their dining companions aloud, but rarely do conversation topics make it to the neighboring tables. The staff, clad in white jeans and button-up shirts, white aprons and shoes are never far away, very friendly and eager to please. At the entrance, like other Factories, hostesses smile behind a large wood and granite slab-lined podium, awaiting the name and number in your party. As you wait for your name to be called, one can visit the cheesecakes and seven-layer cakes on display at the take-away counter, or make your selections for dessert! The tiled floor always sparkles with shine, as your party is guided to its seats. Tall, green plants create a sense of nature in an otherwise dimly-lit, modern-Romanesque setting. Windows along the front side of the establishment look out over the beach, and the beautiful summer sky as it changes from blue to orange to pink with the setting sun. What I ordered: Buffalo Blasts ($9.95) to start! Atlantic salmon next, one Herb Crusted Salmon ($12.95) with red-skinned mashed potatoes and asparagus in a creamy lemon-butter sauce,and one Simply Grilled Salmon ($12.95) with mashed potatoes and four large spears of asparagus. One Fresh Lemonade ($3.95), sweet and tart, with a ring of sugar on the cups rim to complete the meal. On a return visit, Monday, 21 January 2013: We returned to the Cheesecake Factory on our way back from the 57th Presidential Inauguration at the National Mall in Washington, DC, and after a 3-mile walk, to satisfy his craving for Buffalo Blasts ($10.95) and two orders of Fresh Grilled Salmon ($14.95 each), served with mashed potatoes and broccoli. What I loved: The spicy buffalo blasts, served samosa style were crispy, slightly hot with the buffalo sauce and tempered with the blue cheese in a thick ranch-flavored dip. The salmon, soft and tender, light, flaky and fresh, paired well with the creamy, buttered mashed potatoes. The asparagus drenched in a puddle of lemon-butter sauce were savored until the last bite. Why I loved it: The lunch portions were reasonable and filling and the food consistently good. You know what you are going to get at the Cheesecake Factory, and I have never been disappointed. Cost: Average to high ($9.95-$19.95 per lunch entree)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=120

Nichole U.,"Manassas, VA",14,16,,1.0,6/20/2015,"As I looked up The Cheesecake Factory's website after this visit, I was informed that it was very kid friendly. So I was a little baffled as to how the 1 year old in our group was not accommodated at all. I live in Manassas. So my friend & I drove all the way out to Arlington to see our friend, her husband, & their baby. This was their first visit to a sit down restaurant after having a child, by the way. My friend & I arrived early & asked for a table for four plus a high chair for the baby. The three hosts looked extremely confused about life, so I repeated myself. When they finally sat us down they did not bring a high chair. I wasn't too worried about it at first bc I figured out server would do so after the rest of our group & the child arrived.  I was wrong. His name was Hansell & I made a point to remember it. He saw the parents holding the child & not once did he bring a high chair when asked or even offer a booster seat or kids menu or anything. This really irritated me bc he saw my friends taking turns holding the baby so that they could eat. That is just completely ridiculous! Then the friend that I rode up w never received any of the condiments he ordered. My food came out wrong & ten minutes before everyone else's food. Then once the food runners brought the rest of the food, Hansell disappeared. For a long time. I was never asked if I wanted another glass of wine. My friends drinks weren't refilled as well. Then when he reappeared, he put the check all together & just left it at the end of the table & walked away. Before this, I was going to order a dessert. It is the Cheesecake Factory after all. But he gave us a really dirty dessert menu, which I know he saw because he opened it to the page for us before handing it over & it had food all over it. Then he disappeared again for so long I was just over the entire thing. So after waiting twenty more minutes he came back to retrieve the check & I told him we were not on the same check (but thanks for asking bc that was a pretty odd assumption to make) & asked if he could split it. Disappears again & we all kicked ourselves for not having any cash bc we knew it would take him forever to process the cards.  The food was decent, but my friends felt like they were a nuisance for bringing their 1 year old son with them to lunch. It wasn't busy. I feel that they could've been way more accommodated for the hefty prices on the menu & the easy 80$ our checks were combined (which would've been more if he ever asked about a wine refill or checked to see if my friend had decided on a cocktail). I feel as if he was about to be off & just didn't care at all about us as guests. It was a really bad look, Cheesecake. I expected more from you specifically as a restaurant. I am appalled at the terrible service they received & am really upset on their behalf. Parents bring their kids so they don't have to cook or clean. It's a break for them which they needed desperately. Instead, they were forced to take turns holding the baby so that they could eat their meals. Completely ridiculous. Hansell should have been trained better. It is pretty obvious that a 1 year old needs a high chair or at least a booster seat. It is also sad that while it was so slow we never got what we asked for. Needless to say, I don't think that my friends will be coming out again with their son for quite some time. Most of our visit was us trying to convince them that there was something wrong with Hansell & that bringing their baby to lunch was not at all an inconvenience. Especially to a restaurant who welcomes children which is what their website claimed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=140
Noor M.,"Champaign, IL",10,68,36,2.0,6/14/2015,"Stopped by Cheesecake Factory for Appetizers and Dessert around 11 pm on a Saturday night. We walked in and despite three people (who I assume were employees based on their clothes) standing at the reception desk, we were not greeted or welcomed. After waiting for 5 minutes, one of the said three people showed us to our table.  Our server showed up with menus and asked about drinks. We ordered a pizza and while it did arrive in around 15 minutes or so, it tasted no better than frozen pizza. I'm still struggling to figure out why I would pay so much for something so greasy and tasteless. Water would have helped during this ordeal but our server was no where to be found.  After waiting till what seemed like eternity, our server finally came around and asked about dessert- we ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake.  The cheesecake was pretty yummy and we were glad that at least there was something redeeming about our visit. The service was exceedingly poor. Yes, I realize that we went in pretty late but if they can't manage past a certain time, why remain open till 1 am?  The pizza was awful. It is not something that I will be going back for. Ever.

The whole thing was hard as a brick. I'm talking busting heads with a loaf of bread! I can't believe the cook didn't throw it in the garbage and fix a new one. But instead, the cook burnt it, the waiter prepared it for my to go order and sold it to me. At least 2 people knew it was not fit for consumption and sold it to me anyway.

So when a friend asked me to join her for dinner there I just shrugged all those vague memories off and decided to go and give it a second chance. Bad decision.

The sandwich was huge. So big that I couldn't finish half of it. Why are your meals so large CCF? WHY?

Mo C.,"Denver, CO",530,804,72,4.0,4/16/2009,"Just fantastic! The wait wasn't bad, the service was great, the food was spectacular. So, I'm sure many of you have had the experience at Cheesecake Factory where you get to wait for an hour for a table for two, let alone a table for six. Well, we rolled in at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night with our table of six, prepared to sit at the bar and wait for our table. We were told 30min, but were probably seated in 15 (hell yea!). Now, I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in a while, but apparently in addition to their famous novel-sized menu, they have an additional specials augmentation. Good lord that's a lotta food. I ordered a breaded chicken dish with basil pasta from the specials menu and the fried cheese. My beer arrived, tall & cold. My fried cheese with marinara dipping sauce was great and enjoyed by all at the table. My friends dishes arrived. I was asked what I was waiting for and I said ""something with chicken"" because they always get a little too creative with their dishes names for me to remember them. My chicken arrived, with a strange pile of arugula salad on top of it, a bacon sized slice of procuitto and a pile of angel hair pasta with a basil and olive oil sauce. The salad on top was weird, but good. The chicken was fantastic and the pasta was very good, but too much to handle.  The thai shrimp across the table got mixed reviews in that it was tasty, but not nearly spicy enough. When spicier sauce was requested, tabasco arrived (boo!). Our server was quite persistent about the cheesecake menu after our meal, even though we were quite full. He teased us with the pictures and descriptions until I gave in. I picked out a piece of cheesecake to go and was told by the server, ""that's all I really wanted, was for you to take a little piece of me home"". Ok, that sounds creepy in print, but it was actually quite funny.  We were offered split checks without any whining from our server (this is quite uncommon in my experience). In fact, he suggested that we would have an easier time splitting the bill if we received split checks.  Unfortunately, this review loses one star because after that whole production about the cheesecake, my cheesecake never found it's way to the table, but at least I wasn't charged for it either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=280

And I've never been disappointed by the drinks at any Cheesecake Factory! The whole wheat bread here is also really really really good!! OH! I love it. And of course the strawberry cheesecake never does me wrong. (+2) (3) The service was a little weird. First, they forgot the chicken out of my chicken and shrimp meal. I'm not sure how that even happens. Then someone who I thought was a manager came over and asked me if I minded and if I wanted my chicken on the side. I politely declined but 10 mins later a different guy who wasn't my waiter was apologizing and dropping off the chicken. Obviously this didn't kill me but I was very confused by it.

Ned F.,"Washington, DC",0,129,,1.0,5/4/2010,"Sunday 2pm. As we were waiting to be seated by our waitress, another table of four got seated before us outside. Does that even make sense? Waiter was an ass. We received our food after the table of four that showed up after us, finished their food. A club sandwich and pasta.  That shouldn't take 45 minutes to prep on a slow Sunday afternoon. I've eaten there three times. There is always a wait.  The wait staff doesn't care. You get big servings but you also pay for them $12-14 per plate.  When people say generous portions, it's because you are paying for it.  If you are an older couple or a teenager, then you would think you are getting a deal b/c you are getting leftovers for two days.   Newsflash: it's noodles. You're obviously not paying for service, so what are you paying for?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=280
Doug L.,"Fairfax, VA",6,28,,2.0,1/29/2009,"We came here as a last meal before our baby came. Cheesecake Factory ""CF"" wouldn't exactly be my first choice, but since I wasn't going to be doing the hard work, I didn't object.  Now, ever since eating fish tacos out in cali, I've been obsessed in finding comparable fish tacos out east; however, the one's I find tend to be made with fried fish, but while they are ok, they are not the kind I like.  But, much to my surprise and joy, I found that the CF in philly served fish tacos just like the ones I had in cali, and my love for CF began.  That was in philly.  That was several years ago. This is virginia.  This is now.  I ordered my beloved fish tacos.  Let me go back and explain that the fish tacos that I love are made out of this light, flaky fish and I believe that it is baked, not fried.  The fish tacos that I got from CF were tough and rubbery and dry and felt and tasted like chicken.  In fact, I was so convinced that it was chicken that I asked our server if they accidently gave me chicken tacos.  Nope, it was fish (supposedly) and he was sure.  I'm really curious as to what kind of fish so resembles chicken like that - maybe overcooked tuna?  I should have asked, oh well.  I've also tried the fish tacos at the tyson's CF with the same kind of mystery fish coming out.  Anyway, my quest for fish tacos begins again.  My love for CF has ended. My wife got some kind of salad with chicken, and it was ok.  Her dish - 3 stars, mine 2 stars, average = 2.5 stars, because I'm writing the review, rounds down to 2 stars. Side note:  I wonder why CF gives such huge portions of food.  By the time you're full, you've only eaten half your plate and you can't even think about eating dessert despite holding onto a menu in anticipation of choosing what kind of cheesecake you want to eat.  I would think, given their name, that they would serve normal sized portions at slightly lower prices so that people would be more likely to buy a slice of their overpriced cheesecake.  But that's just my thinking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=280

Justin L.,"Arlington, VA",19,293,4,2.0,7/16/2009,"Pretty terrible experience here last night. I don't normally patronize chain restaurants like this but when I do, I expect a fairly standard, even forgettable experience. That's the best I ever hope for, but the service at this place was so poor it inspired me to register an account on here. It's the type of bad service that you can't even blame the actual servers for because they don't even realize how rude they are being. The problem is clearly with management and a lack of training, so it's not really the waiter or hostess' fault.  We walked in around 10:30 pm hoping to get a quick appetizer and dessert and be out in less than 45 minutes. It took a good 10 minutes to be even noticed and about a half hour just to get our food. We had to request cutlery. Midway through our meal the waiter asked if we would like to order dessert ""because they were closing."" This was maybe 10 minutes after their stated closing time, with loads of people around us still eating their meals. It's not as if we came in with a large group of people at 10:59 and ordered a huge amount of food. It was just 2 of us, and the reason we were still there at that point was because of their own slow and inadequate service. As we were finishing up, a large group of guys who were clearly not patrons (the cleaning crew, perhaps?) sat all around us, adding to the GTFO vibe we had already experienced from the waiter.  The food itself was fine and forgettable, which saves the place from a 1 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=280

Great location that it is metro accessible and the menu has variety of dishes to choose from. Personally, I have always loved their food and keep coming back for the delicious food than anything else. The worse part at many of the location is the servers won't stop at your table. I waited almost 15 minutes before someone would come and take an order. The main course came earlier than the side dish. I thought the side dish comes before the main course? Maybe I am wrong and they do it completely opposite here. My disappointment came when I heard they had discontinued the white bean hummus. I would always order this particular side item over any other side item. Overall great food, but very poor service.

Samuel G.,"Las Vegas, NV",364,210,2,3.0,10/12/2008,"It's only been a month or two since we stopped by the Factory for dessert, after having a beyond scrumptious dinner at Harry's across the street. But I'm still thinking after that last visit: ""HAYZEUS MARIMBA! How did I ever survive, eating like this for SO LONG???"" Whenever I tell people about our initial experience eating at CF, I always tell the story about seeing them wheeling a cart of cheesecake slices by, and it looked to me like a scene from TITANIC. You think everything is big in TEXAS? Bring your DFW buds by for some grub at the Factory. The LUNCH portions could feed most starving nations overseas for a while.  The food quality has always varied, depending on what you choose from that bottomless menu. And whatever you do, plan on eating maybe a third of whatever you order and boxing up the rest...otherwise you'll have no room left for that infamously good cheesecake. This last visit when we just had dessert, we STILL had leftovers to take home and it took me two days to finish mine! So this is still a place to take your raging appetite, because it's guaranteed to be sated, trust me.  The one pet peeve that still remains is the wait time for a table. We lucked out...it only took us ten minutes to score a table on a Saturday night. But it was still fairly early (about 7:30), and that usually doesn't happen. 45 minutes and up to wait is not uncommon, so try to plan ahead.

Ultimately, it turned out that we would be eating at a friend's house a few hours later, so I thought it would be wise to order their appetizer sampler.  That thing alone filled up three people to the point where they could not even eat an entire piece of cheesecake.  I never thought I would say this about a restaurant, but the Cheesecake Factory succeeds in having a menu that is so vast and portions that are so large that you end up feeling disgustingly bloated, that is if you are ever able to make a selection off their ridiculous menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=280

Philip T.,"Washington, DC",70,179,112,1.0,10/21/2011,"I'm usually a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but tonight's experience was among the worst dining experiences I've ever had to endure. The problem here didn't lie in the with the food, which, like most other Cheesecake Factories I've been to, was average, but rather the service. This isn't reflective of the traditional style of review I do for Yelp, but it's something that I feel should be told for the benefit of others who come here. If you come to the Clarendon location and your server is Jay, run. I repeat, RUN. A group of friends and I came as part of a birthday dinner in which we were hoping for a generally quiet and comfortable meal. After taking our orders, we ended up waiting for almost an hour before our food came out, and after which, he never came back to check on us. The restaurant was busy, so we just shrugged it off not thinking much about it. Once we got to dessert, we ordered to-go since we had been waiting for so long which only seemed to annoy him, grumbling as he walked away. At this point, things were starting to really go down. When our desserts finally came, we found out he got an order wrong. When I noted the wrong order, he began to argue with me saying how I ""mislead him"" and then tried to guilt trip me with ""fine, I'll just have to pay for it then"". Excuse me? Really? Next came billing. At the beginning of the evening, we had asked him if we could do separate checks which he had agreed to; however, when we finally got to the end of the meal, he had ignored us and tried to convince us otherwise so he could get out of having to do work. I kid you not, his words were ""It would be less work for ME if you guys just split the check yourselves."" Sorry, but I'm pretty sure it's YOUR job, Jay, not the customers. In the end, we agreed to just split it up on cards and we did the math since we had already spent more time there than we initially had planned. He told us since we were a larger group to just include the tip in our per-card totals. As all was done, we were getting ready to leave once we got our checks back. When the first three receipts came back, we realized that something was wrong. The totals we wrote down, which included the tips, were not there, but rather, he had added an additional 18% tip to the totals that already had the 18% mandatory gratuity added. By the time we noticed this mistake, we also caught another mistake. The wrong dessert order from earlier in the night was still on the check in addition to the proper dessert order, essentially double charging us for one dessert. Needless to say, we were furious. When we brought the tipping issue to his attention, he said it was too late to reverse the transactions (I call BS) and that we would have to recalculate the totals to reflect the tip he was adding in even though he explicitly told us to include the tip in our totals from the start. Between the three checks he already completed, he scammed us out of approximately $14, god knows how much more he could have if we didn't catch it until later. After recalculating our totals, note, we had been working on the bill for over half an hour now, we finally gave the bill with the new per-card totals back to him. He then told us that he couldn't do it because the tax wouldn't be able to calculate (the hell?). When asked why, his story quickly changed and he went off to process the checks never revisiting the issue again. After about 45 minutes of struggling through this debacle, we finally were able to leave. In all honesty, if a restaurant hires such an incompetent employee with such immoral and unethical practices, they don't deserve our, or anyone else's business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=260

I met friends at the bar on a Sunday night around 7pm - we were waiting on a party of about 10-11 people to have a surprise birthday dinner. We are well aware of the practice of not seating until the party has arrived in it's entirety so we had a drink & waited - with the understanding that we would be sat once 10 arrived & the 11th was the birthday girl. Our estimated wait time was AN HR TO AN HR AND A HALF! This should have been my first red flag; having managed a restaurant I know tables flip in 30-45 & any self-respecting place is not quoting 1hr+ wait times on a Sunday night. Everyone but the birthday girl had arrived by 8:45 - at this point our buzzer had not gone off. When we approached the hostess, she told us it would be another 20 minutes. That would put our total wait time at OVER 2 hours. A friend spotted several tables that would seat us & I asked a manager who was now at the hostess stand if there was any way we could get one sooner since the whole point of us being there was for it to be a *surprise*. She brushed me off & told me it would be at least 15 minutes.  Bottom line - I basically had to beg for us to be sat in less than 2 hours. Tables were being held  (because servers had been cut?)

It consisted of sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese. Covered with fresh mushroom Madeira sauce and served with mashed potatoes.

While the menu states it is a very spicy Mandarin-style dish, it was not overly spicy. When I order it next time, I will ask them to step it up a notch with regards to HEAT.

You're buying 2-3 meals for the price of one (at totally affordable prices), and that should make you and your wallet happy. Anyway, I have been to CF many, many times.

Chris J.,"Arlington, VA",0,1,,1.0,1/24/2013,I went here for dinner with a friend last night and all I can say is wow that was some of the worst service I've had and the worst food I have tasted in a very long time. Starting with drinks when our server asked what kettle one was for a extra dirty martini we both stared at her shocked.. She then asks us how to spell kettle one!! Are u kidding me??!! Then when the extra dirty martini comes out it is very clear that its a regular dirty martini as both my date and I work at 2 different bars so we have to ask for extra olive juice that takes the server almost 10 minutes to bring out in a shot ass that has clearly been dropped and is chipped and has a crack going down half of the glass. As for ordering food this server comes up to our table not 2 minutes after we open our menus to see if we are ready... No shit were not ready sifting through 15 pages of adds mixed into their menu figuring out what we want... We get our apps some salad and Thai wrap both were the only good thing about the whole experience but then our entrees show up and they take our Thai wrap before we are done with it.. Wtf is wrong with u people ask if we are done before u take our plates.  Entrees .... How can I describe the worst food we have had in a long time.. She got the gumbo and nothing about it said gumbo the rice was completely over cooked  nothing on her plate was cooked properly and it was not thick like gumbo should be and she ate the chicken out of it and left the rest saying if she had a dog she wouldn't even feed the leftovers to him... As for me I had the shrimp scampi and how hard it is to cook pasta with some sort of flavor?? ..not hard at all I do it at home all the time but wow this was the most bland pasta and over cooked I have ever tasted ... And deep fried shrimp ..really if u want good scampi try sautéing them or grilling them instead  Dessert.. Cheesecake of course and at least they got that right .. Maybe this is all they should carry because clearly that's the only thing they can make correctly Service... Holy crap our server should go back to training and honestly probably never serve I finished my first drink around our apps and set my ass at the end of table clear that it was empty and she never once cleared it or asked if I would care for another I'm not going to beg u for alcohol so she missed out on me having at least 3 drinks And same goes for my friend she finished her drink and the glass was just left there through dinner.. So fuck it we drank water and planned to get drinks elsewhere with friends ... As for the water I don't think there is a water shortage but for some reason our water glasses stayed empty for half of the dinner before we had to ask for water and that took her 5 minutes at least to get and we were one of maybe 5 tables in the whole place. Overall I would never go back there are many other places in Clarendon that are so much better and honestly I would rather eat at Taco Bell Mc Donald's or any other fast food joint before I step foot back in Cheesecake Factory,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=260

It was the day after Christmas and we had just had a very unpleasant customer service experience while trying to so a movie, so we were not in a good mood when we sat down. But Christina M. was so pleasant and so very on top of things that it sort of turned our day around. So thanks for that, Christina M., and next time I want an easy meal without a bunch of melodrama I will definitely consider dropping in again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=260

Josh M.,"Denver, CO",0,23,29,5.0,12/22/2011,"I tried to stay away from Cheese Cake Factory as long as possible after moving to Arlington.  Every Cheese Cake Factory that I have been to in the US has been ok to subpar with regards to wait, service and food.   I honestly believe that this place is run by good management and for that reason I find myself writing a review to counter all those 1 star winers out there. My girlfriend and I had been visiting various restaurants around the Court House, Clarendon area over the past couple months and in general I will say that service has been usually subpar to terrible.  I can honestly say after traveling the US and living outside Arlington, that this city has a general corner on seemingly un-interested wait staff in general. We eventually decided to give the Cheese Cake Factory a go and were highly impressed. First, we usually go out to dinner around 6pm to 7:30pm.   We have never had to wait a single minute to get a table.  I can say that this place gets really busy around 7:30pm onwards, and if you choose to go to dinner late, you will need to accept the inevitable wait.  That's the way it is, this is a highly populated city folks. Everytime we visit, our waiter/waitress has always been prompt, friendly, helpful, refills our drinks and in general much better than your average restaurant in the area. The food is also generally very good.  You will find better food elsewhere (generally for more money), but for the price you pay and the service you get, I honestly dont think you can get any better. My girlfriend really did not want like this place.  To her, the Cheese Cake Factory represents your average terrible chain restaurant (similar to Chili's and Applebees).   Yet, everytime we go, she acknowledges with hesitation that this place is slowly becoming our go-to restaurant. I cannot comment on the 1 star reviews from those that did not like the way their shrimp was breaded or that they couldn't split a check with 25 people, but I can say that if you want great service, good food and some of the best atmosphere in Arlington, go to the Cheese Cake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=260
Jake S.,"Washington, DC",42,145,7,3.0,2/11/2010,"As the epic snowstorm of 2010 was just hitting its stride, we were already apeshit stir-crazy, so we decided to go somewhere to eat. Being unable to agree on anything, we decided to pick the place with the biggest menu that we could walk to, and CF won out.  We both had the buffalo chicken sandwich (weirdly enough, since we couldn't agree on anything 5 minutes prior), and it turned out to be quite delicious. The chicken was moist (hehe, funny word), the breading was crisp, and the sauce was good. The drinks were just ok; 5.50 is an insane price for a heniekin light, but it's light years cheaper than the 11 dollar pomegranate margarita I ordered next. The margarita was delicious, but definitely not worth 11 bucks.  CF is a good middle-of-the-road place if you can't figure out what to eat, as they have several types of cuisine on their 100+ item menu. None of it could be mistaken for gourmet, but it's decidedly better than many other chain restaurants that have novel-sized menus. I wouldn't recommend staying here for drink after drink though, as the prices are insane, so eat up and then go elsewhere for your post-dinner libations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=260

It wasn't bad it just left a lot to desire a boring dish.  The fun part was our drinks my date chose the Strawberry Creamsicle which tasted like an island dream.

Our food was exquisite I received the Black Pepper shrimp and Chicken this comes with rice , black beans , plantains and spice pineapples.

Chris S.,"Chatsworth, CA",255,1601,6253,4.0,3/5/2017,"For decades I've always wondered how a place like to Cheesecake Factory doesn't get at least four stars from everybody. The service is much better than any other chain of its size and there's enough options on the menu to satisfy everyone. As a matter of fact having been to dozens of their locations in the last 20 years I've never had a bad meal or a meal that doesn't come out perfect. The food here is far better than average and the portions are enough for a cow to be full. Sure the menu is so large it can be almost impossible to find something that you absolutely want because there's too many things that you want but why would one complain about that? What's amazing about the Cheesecake Factory is that they're able to do a good job on hundreds of different dishes. Most chains struggle to even do just a few things well yet at the Cheesecake Factory there's nothing that they don't do well. And for those of you that are complaining about the price let's be real. This food is priced more than fair and is actually price with a lot of value. With quality ingredients and massive portions you're getting a deal. Even just there tropical tea is worth coming for or the free bread they bring to your table. But this place is far more than that. I can think of dozens of dishes that are phenomenal. And while their gumbo may not taste like it doesn't Louisiana it's way better then your traditional chain food. Any of their sandwiches, pasta dishes, fish and massive salads are all very good. There's no point me listing exactly what I eat because you're going to spend 15 minutes just looking at the menu and coming up with 10 options that you want all on your own.

Hwal L.,"Roanoke, VA",25,418,1158,4.0,3/15/2016,"When it comes to The Cheesecake Factory, it's all about the sweet corn tamale cakes for me. I don't even bother to look at the menu anymore, D or other companions can handle the novel-size menu.  This was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant outside of Florida, and it was well worth the trek. Saturday evening, it was pretty packed, and we were told a wait time of 15 minutes, so grabbed a buzzer and sat on the bench.  We were seated right when they said we would, and stuck right in. The bread rolls were 2/5 for me, because although the sour dough bread looked homemade and would have been a lot nicer freshly baked, but the crust was way too stiff by the time it was brought to us, and it almost broke my jaw. I miss the honey oats rolls from the other location in Florida we used to go to.  FOOD  The main game, the tamale cakes, were on point, and it was then that I realised how much brighter it was inside this location than I was used to, because I could actually see the colours of each ingredient on the plate! The heartiness of tamale cakes, tang of salsa, fresh avocados, sour cream, and an unknown sauce all make for an awesome treat, everytime.  Service was reasonably quick and friendly, and I appreciated that the service staff didn't give us attitude when we ordered an appetiser only.  GRIEVANCE Before we decided to go in, we thought to check the menu posted outside the building to the right of the front door, but couldn't stand there for more than a couple second because of the cigarette smoke from the rubbish bin which was underneath the menu frame.

(Only when I'm sure I'll still have room for cheesecake, of course.)  I still find the better part of valor is to split the plate in half and plan to take the second half home for leftovers. (Or I guess you could share with whoever you're eating with and not have any left to enjoy later . . . but I'm not that nice.)  That said, there are plenty of restaurants that do some of the individual menu items/styles better, but I thoroughly enjoy The Cheesecake Factory as a place where I can go for just about anything and get consistent quality and a decent amount (in a severe understatement) of food for what I pay, and where the service has always been good. Don't go to the Cheesecake Factory for a nice quiet meal unless you can sit outside -- in the comparative calm of a bustling street -- or hit the narrow window between lunch and dinner.  Otherwise it can be a study in controlled chaos, noisewise -- the most romantic meal will leave you hoarse from yelling to each other by the end of the night.  That said, as with all The Cheesecake Factories, the dark wood, black leather cushions, and deep red, orange, and brass (?) decoration -- as well as the myriad booths -- keeps the atmosphere warm and intimate despite the size of the restaurant. My only wish is that they would stop getting rid of the cheesecakes I like best.  So far the cappucino white chocolate and the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecakes have become extinct, and it's a complete travesty.  Sigh...  It's too bad they've got another 20 or so types or I'd really be annoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=180

Meghan S.,"Alexandria, VA",71,224,45,1.0,5/15/2013,"I am def not coming back to this location ever again. I used to come for happy hour with a friend of mine, but it's been at least 6 months since the last time I came to this location. Food was always good, but the service never was. But I enjoyed girl time so we didn't really pay much attention. **First problem: took 7 to 10 minutes for our server to stop at the table. And I'm not even joking. Having been a server for 4 years, I KNOW you are supposed to stop at your table w/i the first 2 minutes. For all I know it could have exceeded 10 minutes b/c I was chatting up my friend and looking over the menu. The server stopped by with bread and no waters. Could have at least had the bread in 1 hand and the 2 mugs w/ handles in the other. Work smarter not harder right?  **Second problem: the service was crap. When he dropped off the waters he didn't ask if we wanted to order appetizers. Just jetted off to get our drinks from the bar which took like 8 minutes. That was a little annoying because we wanted to order appetizers and had to wait. Didn't even get to interject that we wanted to order appetizers before he ran off to put in the drink order. Then, we never saw our server between the time our food hit the table and the time we asked for our check.  **Third problem: the  entrees were HORRIBLE! I've ordered both of these dishes before a few times at other locations (Steak Diane and Skinnilicious Turkey Burger) and they were so disgusting. We hardly touched our food. The turkey burger tasted like the meat had gone bad and they cooked it and served it. It was so dry and just had the worst flavor. And like I said, I've ordered it several times before and it's delicious...but at other locations (McLean and Woodbridge). The Steak Diane, which is not my favorite to begin with, was horrible. I have never cared for it b/c the cut of meat is terrible and tough, but the sauce was just overly disgusting this time. My friend that ordered it hardly ate any of it, and for some reason took it home with him. *shakes head* So needless to say, $80 wasted and I should have gone with my gut feeling and driven the extra 10 miles to McLean to the Tyson's Galleria location.

After a 30 minute wait, the boyfriend and I were seated sandwiched between two different groups.   I walked in the place knowing what I wanted, my favorite pasta dish from here the chicken bellagio. It is just so amazingly good and they give you a portion big enough for two people.  The bf ended up ordering stuffed tater tots for an appetizer (delicious!) and fried shrimp and fries.  I ordered a slice of the best cheesecake in the world: white chocolate caramel macademia nut. It is amazingly, out of this world, the  , good!

The menu is massive and I don't think I've ever had a complaint. Thats good since I've been to multiple locations in various states. I came for brunch because the last time I was at a Cheesecake Factory I had their Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Hands down the best lemon pancakes I've ever tried. Here in the DMV area there are a lot of restaurants that say they have great lemon ricotta pancakes. Pfffftttt naw not like these! The service was great. We asked for a booth and we got one.

I was eating dinner with a group of friends here once and a also a chick I was dating.  A friend of mine, let's call him ""Asshat"", and I were getting into a heated discussion about what he should do about a girl he was dating but disliked (not present at this meal).  Asshat got upset and said ""oh, so now that you are dating two girls at once, you are an expert on dating?""   The chick I was dating, lets call her Bushy, overheard his comment and promptly asked me what he was talking about. I told her that we were talking about David (seated to my left), then we all looked at his date (seated to his left) and she was all like ""WHAAAT?"".  Oh Snap!, I forgot that David's date was with us!  David looked at the girl and said ""nothing,don't worry about it"" . . . she looked at all of us briefly as we were crushed by the growing silence and then she placidly went back to slurping her pad thai noodles.  How the hell did he do that?  David is like the girl-whisperer... it probably helps that he is sexy as hell.

Took twenty minutes for our server to appear after being seated. He took our drink orders and again disappeared for a while. I don't think we actually ordered until forty five minutes after being there. It wasn't very busy so I don't know why it took so long. When our food came out mine went to the table next me and the at the table lady ate the side and then our waiter realized he messed up so he took it from her and gave it to me and said she didn't touch it. I work at a restaurant and this is a health code violation. So it sat at the table in front off me until I could find him.

A yummy appetizer are the crispy crab bites! Extra points to them for always accommodating my need for a booth. My 2 year old does not like to sit still and the booths are big enough where he can ""explore"" and move about. Plus the waiters have always been nice and brought his food out first so we can enjoy our visit.  But the reason for even coming here is the RED VELVET CHEESECAKE! People it is NOT a game....this slice of heaven will have you hooking on the corner to afford it! hahaha Well...maybe not hooking but you get my point.

I had a awful experience there about six weeks ago I sat outside, waited 15 minutes after another waitress sat me and got me a water while I looked at the drink menu. After what seemed to be forever, the waiter showed up 15 minutes later. I decided to have salmon and steak medium rare. Someone from the kitchen eventually brought us our food and I sampled a bit while waiting for our waiter or someone to order refills on our drinks and ask for A1 sauce. The steak was well done instead of medium rare so I just sat there thirsty and nibbling on the rest of my food that didn't taste like beef jerky. For so many reasons I rarely ever send my food back when it's wrongbut I would've made an exception this time. It would've been nice for the waiter to actually come by since I hadn't seen him since I ordered and I've been out of water since I started eating.  I noticed the other waitress also finally appeared after a 15 minute absence. she came back outside with a nearly empty pitcher of ice water, topped off the first two tables, then disappeared again. As All of this was going on for some crazy desperate reason the host sat several other tables outside instead of telling them that there was a wait and give them the option to sit inside. Sitting 3-4 other tables outside over a 20 min period was disrespectful and careless. This included a large group behind me that waited about 15 minutes before anyone even stopped at their table and that randomly ended up being some guy who said he was a manager. When he stopped by my table I ordered two waters and both of them the cars that it battery died and I got to give it a minute to fucking see if of them had and they had so little icewater 10 sure that I wouldn't run out and a few minutes later I have two waters with almost 0 ice which made no sense.  it still irks me so here I am creating a yelp account just to get it off my chest and hope I'll stop remembering.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=180

Dee H.,"Arlington, VA",2,105,6,3.0,4/19/2009,"My family and I wanted to take my mother out for her birthday yesterday, and this restaurant was her suggestion. I'd never been here before so it was all new to me. The restaurant looks big and fancy, but it belies the casual clientele it services. You don't need to be dressed to the nines to come here. We got seated awfully quickly for being a party of seven (including a small child and a baby). I wish we could've been seated at a table with more leg room as opposed to a booth, though. Our server (I can't recall her name) has the patience of a patron saint dealing with our indecisiveness and screaming kids (that's why I don't think I'll ever have kids --- I don't have the patience for them). We ordered an appetizer sampler for $30, and we should've just stopped there because it was filling (including calamari, quesadillas, tortillas with spinach cheese dip, amongst other things). While they do have booster seats for kids and highchairs for babies, they don't have a kids' menu. The waitress suggested a cheese pizza for my nephew, and I thought she said ""It's a big slice."" Instead she brought out a whole giant pizza, and I realized she said ""It's a big SIZE,"" not slice. He only had a slice or two before he called it quits. I had the wasabi-encusted ahi tuna, and I found the tuna great and the wasabi spicy enough to have a kick but not burn my mouth. The rice was great too, but I could've done without the sweet buttercream sauce and vegetables that came with it. I'd have liked more spice. I also had a glass of Domaine St. Michelle, which was pretty good, but an awfully large amount for little old me. I asked the waitress if they could get a group to sing for my mother, and she claimed they didn't do that. So tell me why did I see a group of waiters sing to another table seconds later? I guess it was another case of not understanding each other, because she did have a few people come over and sing to my mother, bringing her a small hot fudge sundae with a candle in it. Thank you! I ordered a white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake to go, but I still haven't gotten around to eating that yet. I'm pretty certain it's going to be good, because it looked pretty damn good. In the end, I think this restaurant is a more comfortable experience for smaller parties (maybe for a date) than larger ones, and this is not really a restaurant for kids. But that menu was pretty extensive and had so many great things to choose from that I wouldn't mind going again myself (I love my family, but I love space and a quiet dining experience even more!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=300

Barrie C.,"Seattle, WA",54,95,,1.0,10/28/2007,"To me, The Cheesecake Factory represents almost everything that is wrong with America's approach to food.   The portions are ridiculously large.  It's nice to get your money's worth, but seriously, when they talk about a lack of portion control contributing to the obesity problem in America, they're talking about The Cheesecake Factory.  People rail against McDonald's and their supersizing of items, but this is no different.   The menu is also ridiculously large.  So large in fact, that they felt the need to put ads in it.  Am I the only one who is annoyed by this, and by the increasingly ubiquitous presence of ads these days in general?  Ads during TV shows, ads before movies, and now ads in restaurant menus.  Before we know it, there will be ads in our dreams at night. The food itself is incredibly unimaginative and mediocre at best.  I have had the crab cake sandwich because I'm addicted to crab, and it's pretty average.  The service is so-so.  One time I had good service, the other time we were ignored for most of our time there. The one good thing about this place, and the reason it gets any stars at all, is their cheesecake.  They have a bunch of different kinds, and they're generally pretty good. I didn't mean for this review to sound as snobby as it does, and I guess that as chain restaurants go, one could certainly do worse than The Cheesecake Factory, but I'll never understand why this place is so crowded all the time.  With all the better and more unique restaurants in DC, why would you spend your money here?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=300

I like their cheesecake but I don't love it.  My least favorite so far is the raspberry white truffle.  I expected a fresh raspberry swirl in the cheesecake or something similar and instead they just used raspberry extract which does not have the best aftertaste.  The Godiva one was so rich that splitting it between three people was more than enough.  At least they're not shy with the whipped cream!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=300

They also have massive servings, which is great. Having a big portion is kind of silly to complain about. What I should really be complaining about is my lack of will power to stop eating and take the rest home. But I think they should really take a hard look and reevaluate their stance in regards to the concept of quality over quantity. The problem with the Cheesecake Factory is that they are a ""jack of all trades but a master of none"". They do a lot of things pretty well, but nothing they do really stands out.

The server was there when you needed him to be there, but wasn't cloying or in your face every five minutes.  Indecisive people won't like the menu, that's for sure! There are so many choices on the menu, it isn't even funny. CF gets a bad rap among a lot of people who see it as just another cookie cutter restaurant, but it's honestly not that bad, and I'd certainly chose CF over Ruby Tuesday's, Friday's, etc. You get different foods to cater to different tastes, and they at least try to make the atmosphere pseudo-upscale (dimmed lights, minimalist decor). The food at this location was quite good (I seem to end up eating at the Cheescake Factory whenever I go on a business trip, and I must say I've never had a bad meal there). The fried calamari appetizer was nice and crisp without being laden in grease. The GF's salad was a huge pile of lettuce and veggies, and the chicken sandwich I had was very filling. Trust me, you won't leave hungry. In fact, you'll probably have enough for tomorrow's lunch.  The verdict: if you're too damn hip for the cookie cutter scene, you probably won't even be reading this review.

For those of you unfamiliar, Cheesecake Factory's menu is so huge, it's spiral bound. That's how you know it's serious, people. While there's plenty to choose from, be warned that everything is...okay. The hazard of doing everything is that you can't do everything well. You won't get bad food, but you won't get great food, either. Like I said, though, you WILL get a mountain of whatever you order. So there's that. PRICE. You get the equivalent of two entrees...and sort of pay for it. However, you won't be ordering appetizers (again, GIANT PLATE O' FOOD), so you can probably count on spending about $20 per person for dinner. SERVICE. The waitstaff was confused.

Recently, the BF and I stopped by this location to have a late lunch (or was it an early dinner?  Lunner? Dinch?).  Believe it or not, he had never eaten at a CF before.  Needless to say, the menu overwhelmed him and he was not too happy about having to decide between so many choices.  He finally decided on the asparagus and artichoke omlette.  It was served with their yummy brown bread and potatoes.  I had Evelyn's favorite pasta and it was quite tasty (although I wish I had gotten a tad more parmesan on it).  So the food was great. The service was just so so.  We had this stoner kid who was nice enough, but kept forgetting things.  He took my glass for a diet coke refill and never came back.  When we asked him about it, he looked at us and said ""huh?""  Then brought me another diet coke.  He also charged me for 2 diet cokes which we had to have corrected because clearly he had completely forgotten that the refill was free.   Overall, I really do like Cheesecake Factory.  Their cocktails are really good and I have yet to have a meal there that I didn't like.  I hate the fact that I'm always too full for dessert because the dutch apple cheesecake is one of my favorites.  Plus, there are like 5000 other really great desserts too.  I really think that Cheesecake Factory has something for everyone and it's a great go-to place when you just can't decide what mood you're in (but good luck deciding on your meal choice once you're there!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=300

He eventually came back I requested more bread..he brought out one type of bread NO BUTTER and stated the kitchen didn't have any wheat bread ready..I asked later he replied the kitchen still didn't. yet a different server passed by with honey wheat bread for a different table .  When it was all said and done we were trying to decide if we were getting dessert...he asked us 4 times in approx 2 mins...but yet he wasn't attentive all night!

Laura W.,"Washington, DC",249,1152,1745,3.0,8/8/2016,"My boyfriend in college worked at The Cheesecake Factory and could have one meal per night to take home (up to $20-which is basically everything but steak), so I had already pretty much tried everything on the menu that I wanted to before the first time I had stepped foot in the physical location he worked since, you know, who wants to eat at their workplace on their day off. After that relationship ended, I still hardly ever made my way to The Cheesecake Factory because, frankly, after eating it so much for nearly 3 years, it was pretty boring to me, and my favorite item, the cheesecake, could be bought at the grocery store if I really wanted it that badly (which I never did). Anyways, we have a pair of friends who suggested meeting at The Cheesecake Factory to catch up over dinner, so, despite it being pretty far down my list of places I wanted to dine, I obliged since they are more of the ""chain-y type"" of diners, and this is a better chain than some other options they could have chosen. We arrived around 7:30pm on a Friday and it was not busy at all. On the one hand though, it seems like the place to go for birthdays as we witnessed the staff singing happy birthday to at least 6 different tables while we were there. After grabbing a booth, we realized our friends were already sitting at one-and they had bread and drinks-so we found them and sat down. Everyone knows that the brown bread is far superior to the other bread served, and I think most people have been to The Cheesecake Factory, so no need to be redundant on the yumminess of the honey wheat bread. For entrees, our dining companions ordered guacamole (which is served either mild, medium, or hot) with chips and chicken Marsala. Both of them seemed to enjoy their food and took leftovers home, since, as everyone knows again, portions are enough for at least two meals if not more. My boyfriend had the cashew chicken. He said it was his ""usual"" order, and he, too, ended up with leftovers. We split it the following day for lunch and wow-was it way, way, way overly salted! I kept wondering why he was drinking water like a horse during dinner and now I see why! I ordered the appetizer French county salad. It was, as expected, the size of an entrée salad, and contained beets, pickled onions, arugula, asparagus, and goat cheese in vinaigrette. I enjoyed the amount of beets in the salad, although I feel there should have been more than 3 little pieces of goat cheese in the mix. The amount of asparagus slightly made up for the lack of cheese. I appreciated the salad was lightly dressed as often salads are drenched in dressing at restaurants. Although I did not finish, I didn't take my leftovers home. Although I could have totally gone for a slice of cheesecake (preferably the Godiva chocolate cheesecake), no one else wanted dessert, and I didn't want to look like the heifer of the table, so I declined dessert as well.  While our service was slow, our server was friendly and kind of off the wall crazy but entertaining. Normally, I'd think it weird, but he kind of just made it work and was never intrusive. The Cheesecake Factory is never my first choice but it is a pretty reliable chain for those seeking out that option, and this location is quite convenient to the Clarendon metro.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=60

I can't say that I'm surprised the place has 3 stars as it is a chain and I'm sure there are thousands of different experiences. But, just from my POV alone, CF deserves a solid 4 stars. The food is always delicious, their service is typically pretty great, and all in all the place has an excellent variety to choose from. I guess it depends on what your personal rating scales are for dining out, but if a solid variety of options, tasty cuisine and friendly service are on your criteria, CF is a pretty reliable choice. Here's what I'm a big fan of: Appetizers: - The bread (of course!) - Crab Dip - Fried Zucchini Main Course: - Cajun chicken little - still some of the best chicken tenders I've had - Chicken Madeira - Orange Chicken Dessert: - Oreo Cheesecake!!

Natasha C.,"Annandale, VA",94,30,193,5.0,1/14/2017,"Have been to cheesecake numerous times in clarendon and fair oaks as you cant go wrong at this restaurant. Soo many options to choose from. From the super yummy cheesecakes to the small plates there is ample variety. They have  tacos, pastas, sandwiches, salads, etc. I used to order the salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus alot as I love the lemony taste of it. I recently decided to venture out and try other things and have to say I love the beet and goat cheese salad. I have had it as a small plate and  during happy hour as a meal and its light and delicious. The spicy chicken pasta is very flavorful as well. I usually ask for extra sauce on the side and they are very good about providing more. In drinks the mint cucumber lemonade is refreshing and my favorite cheesecakes are the ultimate red velvet and  the sweet and salty caramel, although I have not tried all of them yet. These two are not super sweet and I like that about them not to mention the richness of the cheesecake itself. In appetizers the macaroni bites are great if your in the mood for comfort fried food.  There is also the nacho platter (its huge and the chips are fried just an fyi). The avocado egg rolls are good too as is the eggroll platter with an assorted mix of rolls and sauces. The food is a bit pricey for some things but the quantity is huge so be prepared to either share a meal or take home leftovers for a second meal. Great ambience, waiters are always friendly, and overall a great place to celebrate any occasion especially a birthday as the waiters sing happy birthday for you :) Oo yea and how can I forget great for happy hour as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=60

The atmosphere is a bit overwhelming and the meal is VERY fast paced, but this is pretty standard for a national chain and the surprising food quality makes is a very good option for a family outing. It feels like the floor is full of more servers, managers, bussers, hosts, and hostesses then customers. For the amount of people running around the dining room you would think the service would be spectacular, but there are some small refinements that could help improve it. Clearing plates, checking in on empty drinks, and double checking in on the food would bring the service up to 5 star, but for now I'll leave it at three. The food both times was really amazing. Shepard's pie and skinny burger were particularly good. Of course the cheesecake is great too. We ordered a Reeces cheesecake to go and between the whipped cream and the slice a full sized to-go container was brimming with delicious sugary carbs!

It's that type of restaurant. And that's not necessarily a bad thing (even though I many years removed from my former high school self).

M G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/9/2015,"Usually this is my go-to Cheesecake Factory bc the one in Tyson's Corner sucks, but tonight they are getting 1 star. Mainly for an arrogant, rude, obnoxious bartender. I don't expect to be given a hard time about something simple. ESPECIALLY when I'm paying $12 a drink!! (Didn't know it was that expensive there!) So Im out with an old friend I haven't seen in forever and we're in a great mood. I go to order a drink from the bar but I ask the bartender (Tania b. - who's awesome btw) if she can make the drink less sweet than the way it normally comes. (it's a common practice for cocktails to have a flavored corn syrup added.) Well this cocky obnoxious tall brown-head guy (I wish I would've heard his name once so I could mention it) standing next to her makes a huge scene and starts mocking me like oh u want it less sweet?! What do u think this is?!! KFC??!! Hahahhahha!! And goes on and on with HIMSELF... Well first, that just instantly dampened our mood having the bartender jeering me for such a simple request...like wow. Excuse meeeee. That must have been way too much to ask!  FYI, it could be the taste people don't like of too sweet, it could be insulin or glucose issues, or it could be u simply don't want to drink corn syrup if u don't have to. Anyway, u never know what's going on with the guest and mocking them is definitely not getting u ""cute, funny"" points. So I'm thinking this arrogant jerk, it's really not that difficult to hold extra syrup that you're about to pump into a drink, and second, I'm pretty sure he was referring to a slogan like ""have it your way"" from Burger King or something, but he said KFC. LOL So whatever he said didn't make sense. To makes matters worse, idk why he made our first round of drinks for Tania, but he did and they were horrible!! I think he overloaded both drinks with sweet to spite us.  I didn't say anything bc I don't like to complain and I was trying to enjoy time with my friend, but on our second round of drinks my friend actually commented the second round was MUCH better (same drink) than our first. I completely agreed, just didn't say anything in the beginning to further dampen our mood since it got off to a rough start with that guy bartender. If I wouldn't have been preoccupied with my friend trying to catch up after so long, I would've said something to management about the shit drink and the obnoxious bartender!!! Lucky him. If you don't know how to interact with your guests, GET OUT of the service industry! And, if I would have caught your name, I'd so put you on blast on Yelp!!  Other than that..good food. Great service Tania b.!! And, other guy at the bar, shorter, blondish brown hair with goatee, awesome job on the drinks!

Let me give you three examples (from various visits):  1) One guy takes what felt like half hour intervals between visitng our table each time (bread, drinks, food, check), but then is back in 12 seconds with the check.  2) I ask a different guy to clear one plate from one of those small tables by the bar and he looks at me like I have just insulted his mother.  3) A third guy keeps forgetting things we've ordered and then basically tells us about his drinking habits outside of work as a way to make us relate to him better (this one's tough to explain but, trust me, it was weird).  In fairness, we have had one normal server and one very good server there on other visits that I can remember.

While I have not had a problem with the service, and the three times I've visited, it's been not terribly busy, my issue with this place is its food.  Terrible service and a long wait time I can deal with if what comes with it is amazing, blow-your-mind food.  Barring that, hell, I'll even take decent food.  Something that won't make me gag or feel my arteries harden just from staring at it.   Unfortunately, whatever comes out of the kitchen cannot be reasonably called food.  Oily and tasteless in stupid gigantic portions that you wouldn't even want to eat anyway. Please, don't waste your time here if you appreciate food in any sort of way at all.  At best, if you must, I've been told the cheesecake is pretty good, but that seems to be about all.

A few minutes later I was still standing there and she looked up and said, ""Can I help you?"" No one else had come in, it was very slow - that confused me. We went for dessert - and the cheesecake was still frozen in the middle (after a 25 minute wait for 2 slices).  I also got a mojito - the ones I've had at the Tysons location are amazing. This one was like drinking sugar water. After finishing dessert, we sat for another 30 minutes waiting for the waiter to come back. Funny, because the people next to use ordered after us and enjoyed their salad and fried chcken (I think?) and left before the waiter even came back to check on us. I finally asked the guy busing the table next to us if he could find someone to bring our check. The waiter came with the check and saw that I hadn't had much of my mojito - and asked about it.

Which makes good leftovers to take to work for lunch.  AND the large portions give you plenty to share with your date/friends in order try other items on the menu.    The specialty drinks are tasty but kinda weak and pricey (as you would expect).  But I dont go there to drink.  The bread basket they bring you has two types (white bread and a brown kind similar to what outback gives) and it's always tasted fresh and warm.  I could get full on their bread alone. The only thing I dont like is that it's really dark inside and pretty cold.  Patio dining is a great alternative option in nice weather.  And so far I've never had a problem with the service.  Everyone was always friendly and attentive.

We gave our drink orders and were given some free bread while we decided what we wanted. Our sever came back and informed me that they were currently out of strawberry lemonade (which I ordered) but handed me a regular one until it was ready. ((The regular lemonade is not something I am a fan of, too tart for me which is why I got the strawberry)) At first this seemed fine but the sever never switched it out. I finally called him over and asked if the strawberry one was ready, he insisted on taking my lemonade yet didn't come back for a good fifteen minutes. I was confused as to why the sever needed to take the drink yet expected me to eat my hot food without a drink. By the time the sever came back half of my food was cold and I ended up taking my entire meal to go so I could heat it back up at home.

Ayana P.,"Arlington, VA",131,186,14,1.0,10/2/2017,"Literally waited 45 plus minutes for our food. On top of that, it took 15-20 minutes to receive our drinks and bread after being seated. It took about 35 minutes for the waitress to even stop at our table to tell us our food would be out soon. She didn't offer to refill anyone's drinks or offer bread. A party of six had one round of bread that a party of two could have finished on their own.  I live down the street from this place and just have higher expectations of local restaurants. However, last night, I was reminded that this is not a customer-service based neighborhood establishment. The customers come last here. The manager's apology couldn't have been more sorry. It was the most unapologetic apology one could give. I order take-out from here during the week - A LOT for work customers. Nope not anymore, don't even care that it technically doesn't come out of my own pocket.

Nawal A.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,1,,1.0,8/5/2017,"I am writing this regarding the appalling service me and my husband received yesterday evening at Cheesecake factory in Arlington.  First and foremost I would like to say that I went there on july 25th for my birthday meal and the food wasn't up to standard. The fries were cold and tasted like they had been sitting there for a while. The crispy catfish wasn't so crispy and was wet on some sides. I understand that some of your produce maybe frozen but on that particular day I could really taste it. I decided to give it a blind eye and reassure myself that every business has its bad days.  However, 30th July we went back to the same location as it was my husband's birthday on the 27th and I thought I'd treat him to a belated meal. We approached the hosting desk where we were reassured that there was a table outside that just needed to be cleared and we would be seated in the next 10 minutes. As I am heavily pregnant I left my husband inside and went outside to get some fresh air where I saw the table being cleared. A few minutes later I see a group of people being seated on thay exact table. Therefore I went back in straight to bring it to their attention, my husband had informed me that the hostess that had promised us the table had brought it to the other hostesses attention but she decided to disregard those instructions.  I do have the hostess's name and wish not to disclose it for the time being as I am not someone that wishes to see her face severe punishment. Nevertheless I want to bring it to your attention that the way in which she dealt with it was utterly unprofessional. She insisted to argue that the other table were first regardless of the fact that her colleague reassured her we arrived first.  I am heavily pregnant, and you would think out of good customer service and goodwill she would have solved the situation in better manner. The manager wanted to compensate the situation with a dessert but seeing that neither I or my husband like sweet things he stated that was the best he could do.  All in all my experience in cheesecake factory twice in the same week wasn't very pleasant. I would suggest that the hosting team to be more precise and deal with such situations in a better manner.  I hope to hear back from customer service team",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=40

Andrew D.,"Vienna, VA",108,155,355,4.0,2/14/2015,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times but I've never actually sat at the table . I've always sat near the bar and enjoy a couple of drinks with some appetizer. The service has always been pleasant , the wait staff are attentive and friendly.  On my last visit I actually ended up sitting on a booth with a couple of friends and dinner was satisfying and was very enjoyable. I'm a big fan of pasta , so I've tried a few of their pasta here and it was never disappointing.  Last night's garlic pasta with shrimp was equally as yummy. I can't say my friends would have agreed with me especially with the garlic breath that came with it.  Just remember to bring a gum if you are going to have this and never order this if you are here on a date. They have a huge menu here and you can find everything from burgers , salad to pastas and steaks. The best thing of all , not only they have different kind of food but have different variety of it as well. They have like 10 over different kinds of burgers.  It's really hard to pick out what you want to eat at times. Since it can get a little over whelming with the large selection. They give a very generous portion here, which I tend to finish because I like pig out. Most of the friends that I've been here always end up bringing some home. You must have some sort of game plan when you come to  Cheesecake Factory. Take it easy on the appetizer and entree , so you can actually have room for CHEESECAKE ! I mean this is what they are famous for so you should at least share a dessert with someone. They have plenty of variety of Cheesecake for everyone.

With the exception of one bad incident with my miso salmon, those three dishes are always on point. I've dined at the Arlington VA location in the past and had good experiences with the food, service, and ambiance. My most recent dining experience was the same except for dessert.  I ordered carrot cake to go.  When I went to eat the cake later, the whip cream that was placed beside it did not travel well and made the cake soggy in places. Word to the wise, when ordering dessert to go, ask for any toppings to be placed in separate container.  I never had a problem with the desserts in the past and that is probably because I always order cheesecake.

Badrea G.,"Silver Spring, MD",19,2,,1.0,3/10/2017,"I have NEVER had such a negative experience at a restaurant!!Today at noon, i called the restaurant to inquire about eating in. My friend and I only have one hour to eat our lunch, and return to work. This doesnt include travel time, and seating/pick up time. I asked the hostess(-who did not introduce herself- on the phone if i would be able to place my order and have the kitchen make it ready at 1 PM for us to sit down and eat. The person on the phone said no. I then asked how long it usually takes for food to be prepared and brought out. She said about 20 minutes. With a travel time of about 5-10 minutes, this would not work for me. So I then asked if I could order for takeout, then sit down to enjoy our food. She said yes, then transferred me to someone who could take my order. Mina answered the phone. let me just establish the fact that she did not introduce herself at this time either. I did not know it was Mina that i was speaking to until a later time. At the beginning of the call I said 'Hi, how are you? I'd like to place an order for pickup, but i will be eating in the restaurant."" She said Ok, then proceded to take my order. Fast forward one hour, after a 5 minute wait to be directed to the-not labelled- pick up area, I grab my food and proced to look for seating. One of the hostess then tells me ""you guys can sit at the bar'. I tell her that we would like to sit at a booth, we choose the booth and ask for them to please wipe it down, and that we would be ordering more food and drinks, as well as tipping our server. After a 10 minute wait at the front of the restaurant, with both hostesses throwing us nasty looks and whispering to each other-they stopped as soon as they saw us looking at them-, they finally clean off the booth-after assisting about 3 other walk-ins, like we werent a priority-, and we then sit down, open our food, and begin to eat-with no drinks. No server appears, so I turn to a busboy-who was cleaning a table behind us- and ask him to please send a server over. He says OK and dissappears. Let me just establish that at this point, we were already very irritated at the service we were receiving, but were willing to give whoever our server was a chance to redeem.About 5 minutes later, Mina then comes over and says 'You guys can sit at the bar. I have customers that are waiting to sit down.' My friend asks her 'You want us to pack up our food, and move to the bar?""  We ordered a Pizza, a salad, 3 slices of cheesecake, a grilled salmon, and the avocado eggrolls. ALL of this food was spread out on the table open as we were eating. Mina responds with 'Yes, I dont want to argue with you, I have customers waiting to sit down"". As Mina would not let me speak, I then ask her(this is when I finally find out her name) ""What is your name?"", She responds with ""Mina"". I then say: ""Mina, I'm not going to argue with you either. we called and inquired about this situation and were given the clear 3 times, including by you. We only have 40 more minutes to enjoy our lunch, we are waiting for the server so we can order more, we will tip, and we are not about to pack up all this food and move clear across the restaruant."" She is adamant about us moving, tries to deny the fact that I told her over the phone that we would be eating in, and my friend is starting to get very annoyed. He cuts the ""argument"" short and says, ""forget it, I'm not even gonna talk to you rignt now, i'm leaving."" we then tell Mina: ""If we cant sit here, then were going to leave. I'd like a refund for the food."" My friend couldnt even bear to be in the restaurant and goes to stand outside in 30 degree weather with only a cardigan on, while I receive my refund. We then leave. As if everything that just happened wasnt a HUGE injustice to us, the fact that the workers couldnt even identify themselves, couldnt even crack a smile, were throwing us nasty looks like we had not just spent about $70 on our existing food and were going to spend even more AS WELL as tipping our server, and we were treated like trash by someone who as of yet hadnt even established whether she is a manager or not, we had to waste an additional $15 on the ubers we ordered to get there and back to work!I have NEVER been treated so poorly in an establishment in my entire life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=100

I hadn't been to C.F. in almost a year because Ive been trying non-chain, mom and pop type places since moving to this big city. When I got a gift card for Xmas I was actually excited to go back. What a disappointment.The food was not good at all. I get the same thing all the time. When I went in the past it has never been this bad. I had buffalo blasts for appetizer. The first one was OK but the second one I bit into tasted like uncooked chicken. I tossed that one and tried another and it was half OK and the other half had like grissley (really can't think of the right word to describe the taste) chicken. I gave up. I had already ordered my entree so just waited for something better to come. The crab cakes were just okay not good but the fries were stale. I didn't even take my leftovers and we all know at C.F. there are usually leftovers. Don't go to this C.F. until they get new chefs. These chefs must have just got out of high school football practice and ran over to their weekend job. The best thing about this experience was meeting up with a friend, my drink was strong and the waiter was absolutely wonderful, hence the two stars for him. Even the cheesecake I ordered tasted like the crust was burnt. It was a snickers cheesecake so I know the crust is supposed to be dark but this tasted burnt. It was bad. I didn't complain to my waiter because all he could have done was go back and get me some more bad food. It was on a gift card so I took the loss since it wasn't my actual money.

Mia N.,"Alexandria, VA",22,307,92,2.0,1/9/2012,"I don't know why I keep on coming to this chain.  We went in Naples, Florida last year and it was average and blah, so I should have known better when we went again 2 weeks ago to the Clarendon location.  I really wanted to buy stocking holders on sale at Pottery Barn, which weren't even there, and which I should have just gotten on line, but they had sold out online!  Anyway, I got excited thinking we could have good food here.  Never again.  I would rather go cheap and just find a Taco Bell for sustenance than spend another $50 here when I could spend that same $50 on at least 3 days worth of snacks and food from Trader Joe's or Shopper's. We made the mistake of ordering the nachos, which we or I gobbled up as I was famished. They weren't even that great.  Not that much salsa and no chili. Just fried chips with globs of greasy melted cheese.  The best nachos are at Numero Uno and Hard Rock Cafe.  Anyway, I was so full I couldn't eat my entree, a southwestern barbeque salad, which was tasteless.  Not enough dressing.  It was a wasted $9.95 and I didn't even eat it.  The corn wasn't even sweet.  The menu is just too much and full of  heavy sleep inducing fattening foods that I always choose a salad, which ends up not being that great.   Next time if I ever go here again, I will just order an appetizer and just eat the complimentary bread.  That's enough.  My hubby got a $14 burger.  I yelled at him.  He said he didn't realize his kobe burger was that much.  $14 for a freaking burger?  If he wanted a burger we could have gone to Burger King for a $3 burger.   Cheesecake Factory was and is a total waste of money.  Oh, and my kid's macaroni and cheese was absolutely miserable, greasy, and the pasta was undercooked and chewy.  We brought it home and miked it for my kid, and it had like 3 tablespoons of pure liquid oil/fat.  When I make home made/baked from scratch mac and cheese, I have never seen droplets let alone puddles of oil.   The only good thing is the cheesecake, which is light and airy and, which I bought on the way out.  No sense in adding it to the total bill so that I'd have to tip the guy more.  Anyways, our service was fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=220
Wespen N.,"Arlington, VA",6,110,1,1.0,5/17/2012,"What the hell is this chain trying to be? They're catering to the family set, the bar set, the ""trendy, hip & modern"" set and the dessert crowd without being definitively one or another. I can see why Cheesecake Factory does well in mega-malls, but Clarendon? There are plenty of places that aren't horrifying corporate frankensteins that are within walking distance of Cheesecake Factory. There's no parking lot here, so you're going to be paying for parking one way or another, so why compound matters by going to a chain? I've been here a handful of times, and every time it's been loud. Loud Loud Loud. You don't have to shout to be heard, but you're pretty damn close. The food is palatable, but only because it hinges off the hack cooking technique of adding butter to everything. Paula Deen would be proud, I guess, but if I'm looking for greasy spoon-level food, I'm not looking for it to cost as much as it does here, nor am I looking for it to be presented in a goofy manner that some executive board thinks is ""haute cuisine.""

Last time (and this is a perfect example of any visit i have had), it took about 40 minutes to bring out our side salads.  It was obvious that the main courses were coming out too, so they put those under some hidden heat lamps until we were done with the salad, then brought out the main dishes.  One of the main dishes had salad with it to: NOTE to Cheesecake Staff: DO NOT place COLD Salads under a heat lamp!! This time we were seating right next to the lovely server computer where they ring everything in.  This was actually better than the usual: being sitting about 3 inches from someone you don't know.

So here's a basic review of the nastiness I had to endure at TCF. I got the shrimp scampi and the steak diane. The shrimp was overly breaded and there was barely any steak in the steak diane. Just a ton of mushy arse mushrooms. The mashed potatoes were decent I guess. Even my drink was gross. Can't remember what it was called but it was a hot drink with coffee, Bailey's and Kahlua. My BF got the meatloaf and all I could taste was a bunch of rosemary.  The only thing was half way decent about my meal was the little tapas style crabcakes and that's just 'cause I was super hungry. Oh and the banana cream cheesecake was superb. This is the kind of place you go to when you're dining with someone who is super picky and unadventurous when it comes to food.

Appetizers 1) First of all, I could eat that wheat bread that they serve as my dinner.  It is delicious, especially with the butter. 2) Made-to-Order Guacamole - Delicious.  Wasn't as spicy as I would've liked it to be, but it was really good. 3) Thai Lettuce Wraps - These are fantastic.  They come with all the right ingredients and sauces and large leaves of lettuce.  This is huge so it should definitely be shared.  Actually my husband and I got these last night and didn't even order dinner, went right to dessert. Entrees 1) Chicken Madeira - I got this when I was on a diet and I remember it being pretty good and very low carb. 2) Weight Management Santa Fe Salad - I don't even know if the dressing is low fat, but it tastes like it is.  Other than that, I think this salad is pretty good given that it's ""weight management"" 3) Louisiana Chicken Pasta - I love spicy food and this was delicious.  It still wasn't as spicy as I would've liked it to be, but it had a nice little kick and I love that the chicken was crusted in parmesan...added great flavor. 4) Thai Chicken Pasta - I remember that I got this once and the only reason I didn't get it again was because it was so good that I KNOW I would overeat if I got it again!  This is a perfect combination of like Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai. 5) Garlic Noodles - Sounds good but very boring and bland. Cheesecake 1) Red Velvet Cheesecake - OMG this is amazing.  I wish it were a LITTLE heavier on the red velvet cake instead of the cheesecake but this is amazing.  And if you get a bite with those little white chocolate chip shavings on the back...heaven. 2) Hershey Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - This is a new cheesecake and it's amazing.  This is death by chocolate.  Very rich so I could only eat a little bit but on the upside that means my $7 cheesecake will last for four days. 3) Tiramisu Cheesecake - Delicious and very much tastes like Tiramisu. 4) Brownie Sundae Cheesecake - This is good but with all the chocolate and fudge, it really should be accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 5) Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake - Good but not wow.  The pieces of cookie dough were too big. 6) Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake - Death by chocolate again.  Really rich but delicious.  I'm a choco-holic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=240

A C.,"Alexandria, VA",3,61,3,3.0,3/2/2009,"A group of girlfriends and I decided to meet up at cheesecake for a night of fun cocktails, nice food, and a great piece of cheesecake.  The prices were moderate, except for drinks which are about $10 a pop but they do not list their prices on the menu.  We sat at the bar and our waitress was very attentive and nice.  The food was ok, nothing extravagant but that was to be expected.  The cheesecake was great and it definitely made my night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=340
Amy S.,"Arlington, VA",3,15,,4.0,10/19/2007,I like going there when I don't mind spending a bit of money. The portions are huge though and the variety is huge. The mixed drinks aren't all that great. The two dishes I always get is the herb crusted salmon and the pork chops. Those dishes are always usually good. I'd adivse to avoid the dinner rush especially on the weekends because sometimes the wait can be as long as 45-60 mintues.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=340
J J.,"Woodside, NY",8,263,,3.0,9/18/2007,"Our server was amazing.  There were 12-13 people at our table, and she remembered our orders and got our bills right (we asked that we get our checks separately).   Food is pretty standard - good for what it is.  Their menu is like a book, so it can be hard to choose what you want.  I like the brown bread they serve before the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=340
Constance G.,"Alexandria, VA",0,55,,1.0,11/15/2007,"My office buddies love this place, but I agree with some/many reviewers that the food is overpriced, oversized and awful.  I have had issues in the past with Mayo (I hate it) and Mayo like sauces (they do some strange things to Mexican food here).  Also, the cheesecake is not as good as what I have had at Costco, and about seven times as expensive.  The service I have had here has not been bad, and the management is trying to be accommodating, but the basic product is flawed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=340
Bi N.,"Washington, DC",4,47,,4.0,10/31/2009,I am not a cheesecake fan but we went here for dinner because I think their food is good.  The service was quick and the food was delicious.  Can't really think of anything to complain about.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=340
Ryan W.,"Arlington, VA",21,781,65,2.0,2/23/2008,"**1/2 stars We all know and either love or hate this chain.  I'm not going to describe what it's all about, since I think everyone knows about the portion sizes and ridiculous length of the menu.  I'll spend my time in this review talking about the quality of the food. First off, I haven't been to a TCF in a while.  Something came over me this weekend and we decided to go on a Saturday night.  I seemed to remember you could call ahead to put your name on the wiat list - but  no.  This meant a long wait when we got there - even longer than the estimated wait time.  Eventually, when we were seated and had finally decided on our selections, I was most interested in the appetizers, which were very good and freshly prepared.  I guess that's the problem I had with the rest of the meal - it didn't seem all that fresh.  The fries were definitely frozen and tasted a little like cardboard.  Even McDonalds does good frozen fries, so why can't TCF?  The chicken sandwich I had was good, but again the bun didn't seem especially fresh.  Finally, the cheesecake/chocolate cake combo dessert I ordered could've been a week old.  It was over the top and huge, and had it been made that day or even the day before would've been excellent.  But I guess you can't expect everything, or anything but the appetizers, to be freshly made.  Still, I don't go out to eat for ""semi-homemade"" cooking - I'll leave that to Sandra Lee and my mom.  I seem to remember on previous visits years ago being impressed by the quality and freshness of the food despite the large menu.  So, even for the chain experience that it is, I can't recommend this location of TCF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=340
Roberta C.,"Alexandria, VA",2,29,5,3.0,3/16/2010,"ok - it's a chain, but i rather like its faux Egyptian decor with its warm yellowish glow.  love booths.  very friendly waiter.  got the fish special - grilled mahi-mahi - very tasty, red mashed potatoes were so-so, and I forget the vegetable.  husband had salisbury steak.  it's a big diverse menu so pretty much all tastes can be accommodated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=340
Amarie K.,"Arlington, VA",1,34,,3.0,5/2/2009,"Went on a random Wednesday night with my boyfriend and had a great time!  I'm used to the Cheesecake Factory in Chicago on Michigan Avenue (Tourist hell!), so was surprised to walk in to this location and only have a 15 minute wait.  We grabbed a seat at the bar to wait and I decided on a Lemon Drop Martini---made to perfection!  10 minutes later we were promply seated and picked out the beer cheese dip as an appetizer.  The chips were a little salty, but the dip countered it.  Our server was attentive and made sure our drinks were full and we were happy.  I commend her for doing a great job managing a few 2-3 person tables and a huge 15 person table.  I had the shrimp and salmon dinner and the portion was perfect!  Yes, their menu is a novel, but it is the place to go if you want a variety for the people you are with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=340
B MAC C.,"Arlington, VA",0,18,,4.0,2/3/2010,"You must try the BUFFALO BLASTS!.....great appetizer. And you must also order Extra Blue Cheese for dipping. They are soooo good.

B G.,"Overland Park, KS",0,31,,4.0,8/17/2009,"The food here is always solid and the service top-notch.  Most restaurants in DC have awful, awful service.  Cheesecake Factory stands out as being one of the few that seems to have hired competent wait staff.  My wife and I frequent this location because the food is consistently good and we have yet to have a bad experience with the service.  I know better food can be obtained in DC, and the no reservations policy is a bit of a pain, but the consistently good service is what keeps us coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=340
Queen W.,"Fairfax, VA",0,33,,3.0,3/8/2009,"As stated by many other reviewers, the portions are huge.  If you are hungry, this is the place to go.   Stick to the salads and sandwiches.  Anytime I have ordered a pasta dish or meat dish, something has been wrong.  I actually went there for my birthday this year.  I ordered the thai bang bang chicken and shrimp.  First, it came with no chicken-just the shrimp.  However, it was very tasty and the coconut sauce was delicious.  Then they brought me the chicken on the side.   For all you cooks out there, how hard is it to COOK chicken?  I cut into it and it was RAW! and pink.  In the dimly lit restaurant, I bet a lot of people don't look at their food closely and notice the color of their meat.   They apologized profusely AGAIN and then brought me another dish, swearing that the chicken was thoroughly cooked this time.  By this time, I had shared my friend's meal, was full, and ready to go.  I took it home and had it the next day.  Guess what? This time there was no coconut in the sauce and there were still RAW pieces of chicken.  This happened another time at the Fairfax location as well.   My boyfriend and I ordered chicken carbonara-the sauce was great but the chicken was undercooked in both of our dishes.  Do NOT order chicken here-especially if it is in bite size pieces hidden in some sauce.  I used to really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.  After 2 RAW experiences, I am totally grossed out and have not been back .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-arlington?start=340
