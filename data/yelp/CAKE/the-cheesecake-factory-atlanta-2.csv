Jaclyn K.,"Gainesville, FL",482,5,1,1.0,12/27/2017,I am extremely upset about the quality of food at the Cheesecake Factory as it has gone down hill significantly over the years. I called ahead to order the BBQ chicken salad but with shrimp instead of  chicken because i don't eat meat. It was about 9 o'clock on a Wednesday night (not a crowded time). I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived in 25 minutes and it was not ready. In fact i don't  believe they event started making it because the girl went back to the kitchen to get it for me and she was gone for over ten minutes. This salad has 6 ingredients (besides the shrimp) and i was charged over $21 which is absurd in an of itself. But they left off one of these ingredients (the fried onions) which i did no notice until i arrived home. Some lettuce and the avocado were also brown. I was also given no butter with my bread. Needless to say i will not ever get food at this location again as this is not what i expected and a huge waste of money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40
Tinisha R.,"Atlanta, GA",76,66,186,3.0,7/1/2017,"I've been to this locations several times for dinner, lunch and happy hour. There is ample parking as this location is pretty much at the mall. As usual for Cheesecake Factory the restaurant is massive with a massive menu. My bf always gets the fettuccini Alfredo with a meat and broccoli. He must like it since it's the 4th time he ordered it. I like the fettuccine noodles they use, the sauce is pretty good too. They do tend to skimp on the meat and broccoli though. I had the skinny chopped salad which was pretty tasteless and had some brown romaine hearts in it. Portions are super large here so I suggest ordering off the lunch menu if you can. Prices are reasonable because of the portion sizes. Wait staff has been pretty consistent with pretty good service. Food comes out hot and promptly. Taste wise the food is average at best. Happy hour prices are great on food (get the burger!) and ok on drinks.  Oddly enough I've never had the cheesecake. It's probably because I'm always so full after my entree. All around a solid place to eat but it won't wow you. Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40
April V.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",93,4,,2.0,11/14/2017,"This has to be the worst experience I have ever had at this place, from start to finish was a joke! We arrive and in the area it is one woman next to us and we order knew exactly what we wanted and I watched the guest next to us get up go to the bar and pick up her drink that was waiting to be served to her ! We wait over 30 mins for our drinks to arrive and watched 4 people get served before us and now we have waited an hour. Finally he tells us 4 mins and sorry for the wait at this point we are ready to leave, and we ask for the food to go and just pay! The food was not what we ordered and the appetizers we ordered was cold !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40

Rebecca H.,"Atlanta, GA",259,74,257,2.0,6/15/2017,"Flavor-wise, I think this is one of the worst locations I've visited. The service I can't really comment about, it's just mediocre and nothing special. The food though! I genuinely enjoy a lot of the dishes at most Cheesecake Factory locations. This one was a stickler--absolutely everything was bad! My carbonara had barely any cream, had no taste, had maybe 7-8 pieces of tiny bacon thrown in. My friend ordered the angel hair shrimp pasta and oh my gosh, that was the worst thing ever! The noodles were no where near al dente and basically melted in my mouth, and that's not a good thing. The noodles just broke apart because they were so over cooked. Plus, the portion was oddly small for a Cheesecake Factory plate. We also ordered an appetizer, the fried tods. Supposedly this was supposed to have pieces of bacon! Nope! All I could taste was flavorless mush. An odd texture and lackluster taste. The highlight of our meal was probably the bread service. That was yummy with the butter... but honestly, quite disappointed and will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40
Hema M.,"Sparks, NV",0,56,46,1.0,5/16/2017,"Ok just so you know i'm not picking on them for no reason Neil my server was a sweetheart. This is more to do with the way i was treated from when i walked in.  The hostess didn't introduce herself, didn't welcome me to the cheesecake factory did not say thank you and moved 2 people in front of me even though i was the first one in! This happens a lot in Georgia the only thing i can assume is because i am not of the same ethnicity. Coming from the west coast this has never been a problem but it happens all the time only with women in Georgia. Then the girl who seated me actually went out of her way not to give me what i wanted. I asked if i could sit in a booth and was told there is no server in that section, and low and behold there are now people sitting in that area. Maybe its just me but i think her attitude and LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE stinks. I'm just visiting Atlanta and this will be the last time i will come to the Cheesecake Factory here.  I thought we were all born equal! apparently not. This needs addressing by management.The time of my visit is 6pm the date is May 16th 2017 you should be able to work out who the two girls are. Very Disappointing. I love Cheesecake factory on the west coast we have none of these issues in California. Neil the Server is very nice, attentive and polite. His customer service is excellent. I can't praise him enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40
Paula P.,"Madison, AL",2,34,14,4.0,7/6/2017,Food was great. Martini's were strong.  Loosing a star because the patio could use some cleaning. All of the chairs had bird shit on them.

MaryShannon R.,"Atlanta, GA",141,38,78,5.0,7/18/2017,I'm glad this location is close because it's always a go to when we can't decide where to go and we are never disappointed. It usually stays pretty busy but it's a huge place so room for everyone. The outside seating is awesome and I try to sit out there when it's open. Food is always amazing! Mac and cheese balls appetizer is good and enough for everyone. I've never been disappointed with anything. If you have room there have ton of dessert options (duh) I always take some to go! Parking is all over the place but it shares a lot with other restaurants and a mall so it can be trying depending on Day and time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40
Marie M.,"Atlanta, GA",206,214,37,3.0,11/29/2016,"Cheesecake Factory should not surprised anyone. It is after all a chain. I am giving it 3 stars since I think we received excellent service by Our server Kwame and the food was just ok and a little bit pricey for what it was. We ordered a flatbread and a chili to share. We also got one slice of cheesecake. I still ended up paying around $20 even with a $25 gift certificate. Still, the food was consistent. The chili was really tasty. The flatbread was OK, nothing special but it tasted ok. The pumpkin cheesecake was of course very tasty. Can't go wrong with that! Having said that, it looks like the cheesecake portions are getting smaller. It's the Cheesecake Factory so you should have a good idea of what to expect. The service was really good, the food average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40
Lashanda W.,"Atlanta, GA",4,16,24,4.0,12/14/2017,"Best experience with a group that I have had here thus far. I came to Cheesecake in Dunwoody for my boss's farewell party with about 18 of my colleagues around 11:30am on a Tuesday. Once we arrived we noticed that the restaurant had just had a Food Safety inspection and had not received a favorable grade. We were for a lack of words mortified to see that right before our meal as we are ironically employees of the nations premier health protection agency. Nevertheless, our reservation was made and it would be difficult to navigate such a large group to another restaurant with such short notice so we decided to take a chance. We had one waitress I believe her name was Ashley or Britney and she served all of us efficiently and with courtesy. The food did not come out all together but that wasn't a big deal for us. No one had any issues with their dishes, all preferences were paid attention to. We received our drinks in a timely fashion as well as our checks. I ordered the same thing I always get the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with extra veggies. It was piping hot but a little heavier on the sauce then usual. No one reported ill so all went well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40
Nina L.,"Doraville, GA",97,107,204,4.0,4/16/2017,"I had the Super Food salad. It was soooo good. And good for me. They have a very extensive menu here and a crazy amount of cheese cakes, every one in your party should be able to find something they'll like on the menu.  It takes me a long time to figure out what I want to eat, so I usually pick it out on the online menu ahead of time. I feel reviewers are slightly biased against chains - keep that in mind when you view a chain restaurant's score. Reviewers favor restaurants that are not well known- it's like a hipster mentality thing. They give these novel one - of - a - kind spots raving reviews, and then when you go there, you're like, why was everyone raving about that? There's a reason why there are 20,000 MacDonalds, but every MacDonalds somehow has a 2 star rating *thoughtful finger on chin emoji*. You know where chain restaurants actually rack up big points? Consistency. Expert designed recipes. Ability to comp over slight dissatisfactions. Coupons and specials. Rarity does not equal higher quality- the reverse is actually more likely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40

Peter K.,"Atlanta, GA",47,412,125,1.0,2/23/2017,"Food was so-so (3 stars out of 5).  It's a typical Cheesecake Factory location with a menu so large, you really don't know what to get. We got the banana cream cheesecake and the chocolate turtle cream cheesecake, both of which were pretty good at first, but were doused in whipped cream so it was a bit overwhelming. Service was what drove this place to be 1 star.  We were there in a group of four in what should have been a 60-75m dinner, but turned out to be 2H.  The service was just flat out slow.  Multiple times, we were looking around for our server and he was nowhere to be found.  We ended up having to pour our own water at one point.  The first time was between the bread and the entrees, and we saw him chatting with another server.  The second time was after our entrees were finished and we wanted to order cheesecake and he was nowhere to be found.  When we finally wanted to order cheesecake, he mentioned it would be faster to get it out front (but we said we wanted to eat it there). Just to get the check took another chunk of time.  Overall, the meal got dragged out longer than necessary.  Thank goodness for the good company!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40

Shijie Y.,"Sandy Springs, GA",1,4,4,1.0,4/2/2017,"The worst experience I ever had! This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory. CF is well known for it's consistency due its standard ingredients and recipes, however they forgot that the quality of workers is equally important. - Bad chefs: Eggs Benedict - poached eggs or hard boiled eggs? A local diner can do this better. Breakfast for 4 people took 45min for the food. We are not talking about peak hours. It was 10:50am!  - Bad service staff: even after I complained about the food, she still included full amount for something I didn't eat in the bill.  - The WORST manager: this is the root cause of everything. Their management is really bad. I called the manager and explained my experience. He had no facial expression and he did NOT say the word ""sorry"" at all. It was surprising to see that in the service industry! Maybe they think they will get business no matter what because they are in a popular area, but I will not come back to this place any more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40
Jacqui H.,"Atlanta, GA",22,89,200,3.0,2/13/2017,"The menu here is huge!  I also noticed they had a 'skinnylicious' menu which has items with lower calories if you're more health conscious.  It has good atmosphere and the drinks are great too.  I had the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and got fries instead of rice.  The shrimp had good flavour, not spicy at all but the pepper sauce was tasty. I wasn't too keen on the black beans and marinated pineapple, I guess it didn't really go with the dish.  The burgers and sandwich were tasty too, I didn't try it though.  It was pretty good, food is decent and it's a nice place to catch up with friends.  Good location too.  On this occasion, service was a bit slow but other than that I usually enjoy this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40

Vicki N.,"Duluth, GA",40,195,133,2.0,7/6/2016,"Came here on a Tuesday evening for dinner with my coworkers. The wait was not long at all. Our entire party wasn't there yet, so most of us had to be there to be seated.  Our server seemed quite rude and stand-off-ish. From the moment should spoke to us, she didn't seem so friendly. Weird because we're a friendly group haha. There were little things that bothered us about her, especially her serving etiquette. Our last person came late, and he literally had to stand even though we asked for a chair the moment we sat down. He went to the bathroom and came back, and we still didn't have a chair yet. We ended up having to flag down a hostess to bring us a chair. If you requested anything from her, she would walk away without saying a word. We received our appetizers but no plates, so we had to flag someone else down for plates. Then for dessert, I asked for plates with forks and she gave me just plates.  I ordered the steak diane with shrimp scampi. The portion of steak is very small, but the portion of shrimp and mashed potatoes is plenty. The shrimp scampi is not what I'm accustomed to. I assumed it would be sautéed shrimp in a butter and garlic sauce, but it was breaded shrimp in a creamy sauce. Not a fan.  I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in awhile, so I remember the slices of cheesecake being humongous, but I guess they're a lot smaller now. Still tastes good though. For appetizers, if you like buffalo chicken, then I highly recommend the Buffalo Blasts. Its shredded buffalo chicken with cheese then deep fried. It's a huge portion! About 6 large triangular pieces served with bleu cheese and buffalo sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=40

Mimi J.,"Foley, AL",0,6,,1.0,11/21/2017,"How disappointing! Horrible service! We were seated for 1/2 hour with no service whatsoever. There were 5 of us waiting. Until I approached the hostess, there was no recognition that we existed.   Then a server came to our table and explained that the shift was changing and we shouldn't have been seated in that section.  We, the customer, just wanted service.  We did not need to know the behind the scenes issues. She, then, stated that even though she was getting ready to leave that she would wait on us if we only wanted coffee and dessert!!!   We ordered coffee and dessert! Again, we waited for 20 minutes-no water, no coffee-nothing. Now we've been sitting for almost an hour with no food or drink. After this wait another server brought our coffee and dessert.  What has happened to this Cheesecake Factory???  The service is now poor and the food is no longer up to par.

Katy K.,"Atlanta, GA",0,14,6,2.0,1/2/2017,"We ordered take out today (Bistro shrimp pasta) and asked for the shrimp to be grilled instead of battered and we asked for broccoli and sun dried tomatoes to be added. When we got home and opened the box we were sad to see that no broccoli was added, instead a few leaves of wilted arugula. When we started eating we quickly lost our appetite after discovering that most of the shrimp were not cleaned properly and some of them had a very strange color, Not burnt but more green-blue, like they were rotten. We threw everything away and now we feel grossed out :-( On the upside, we also ordered the reeses cheesecake and that one is the bomb. However, we will probably never order food (except dessert) from cheesecake factory again. Please cheesecake factory, make your cooks more aware and responsible. These shrimp should have never made it out of the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=60
Tiffany Y.,"Marietta, GA",213,239,472,2.0,5/10/2016,"Quite the different experience we had at the Cheesecake factory today.  Can't say I was impressed at all with this location.  You would think with all the competition near by they would be on top of things... but guess not.   Anyway for a Tuesday evening around 6:30pm, there was no wait and my friend and I were sat in a small booth in the back by the windows...  As we were deciding on what we wanted to eat, we noticed flies kept buzzing around our table... I ended up killing one on the window but more kept coming and along the window seal my friend pointed out lots of dead little bugs... Gnats, flies... yeah so I wanted to move immediately... Should've take that as a hint to leave the restaurant completely but we were starving and wanted a quick bite before the movies and The Pub was packed.... should've tried The Cowfish place...  So we move to another table... no bugs near by but they cleared the table we left and reset it like nothing happened... they didn't even clean the window seal after we'd pointed out there were dead bugs on it...  I felt bad for the people they sat at the table right after us... I could still see little flies buzzing around that window...  So we decide on our food and while we wait we munch of the regular ol' bread they bring out... The wheat bread was fine, but the sourdough was odd, so we just picked at it...  It didn't take long for our food to come out and initially everything looked ok but it just went to meh in a hand basket as we started to eat.   I ordered the factory nachos, which I've ordered numerous times before and they came out luke warm with globs and Globs of cheese melted on top... I ate what I could but it turned into a soggy unappetizing mess before I could get a quarter of the way through them.  There was a pool of grease underneath the pile of soggy chips and I just gave up.  I drank my strawberry lemonade and waited for my friend to finish the chicken sandwich she wasn't really happy with.  She said the chicken was falling apart and not in a good way... It was probably reheated from earlier... she said the toppings didn't help it either...   Anyway as we were leaving the restaurant, I told her next time we come back to Perimeter Mall... I wouldn't be suggesting Cheesecake factory at all... Just a bad experience all around and their saving grace was the super nice server we had...  Only saving grace... only.  So many other options to choose from at Perimeter and after today even the foodcourt will be an option before we come back here...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=60

Gino B.,"Vancouver, Canada",289,187,1779,2.0,6/29/2015,"I can see why the Cheesecake Factory restaurants closed most of their locations in Canada.  Yes, they have divine cheesecakes but aside from that, there is nothing special about this franchise place that was jam Packed with diners. Starting with an extensive thirty plus page menu filled with advertisements and way too many food selections; the decor is old with beige accents; very 1990's... We noticed Everyone, without exception, was leaving with a doggy bag as this is another chain where a huge amount of very average low quality food is served at somewhat ""affordable"" prices.  Our plates were uber-bland, tasteless, super salty and just not good; but they were HUGE portions loaded with unacceptable amounts of sodium and starch  - none of which are worth describing.  I will admit that the presentation on the plates looked great and very appetizing until you start eating; that's when all the built up anticipation disappears! The waiter proudly brought us a branded shopping bag with empty containers to put our hardly touched food leftovers in; no thanks!  Why the one star instead of just a zero grade? Well, the cheesecakes are truly divine and a heavenly indulgence.  There are over 33 of them on the menu! Skip the reading and head over to the refrigerated display to indulge.   I will never dine in this franchise's restaurants again BUT,  will definitely have a cheesecake slice again and again for sure:  just calling it in ahead of time and taking it to go though!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=60

Kai E.,"Atlanta, GA",216,185,536,3.0,10/13/2016,"We dined at this Cheesecake Factory location for my niece's birthday on a Friday night. The hostess was very friendly and surprisingly  there was no wait so our party of 4  was seated immediately out on the patio.   We waited for our waitress for about 15 minutes before she showed up to take our drink orders.  After our waitress  dropped the drinks off and walked away we waited for another 10 minutes for her to come back to take our food orders. I had a Strawberry Daiquiri which lacked flavor and alcohol. Everyone at my table ordered the Ceasar Salad and their Ceasar dressing was flavorless, it tasted like I was eating lettuce with heavy cream on top, the salad was a total fail. Since their portions are typically big enough to feed a family of 4 I opted to just order a appetizer.  I ordered the bang bang salmon wraps which looked delicious from the  description , I assumed bang bang meant spicy but apparently I was wrong, the Salmon was fishy and the flavors did not go well together. The other members at the table seemed ok with their selections with the exception of my one niece who did not like her entrée. Although during most of our dinner, our waitress was not very attentive, she did make every attempt to make sure my niece liked her dish by bringing out sauces and when that failed even though we didn't ask or complain she removed the Uneaten dish from our bill. To top off what started off as a horrible birthday dinner, our waitress brought out a birthday dessert for my niece because she overheard us talking about it. My experience here gave me mixed feelings about the popular chain that usually provides better service.

Louis P.,"Atlanta, GA",0,4,,1.0,4/10/2017,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  SO BAD, WE LEFT!!   Can I rate them a zero???  We went early afternoon on Saturday, April 8 ... weather was gorgeous, so we sat outside.  It took the waitress at least 15 minutes to finally come to our table for drink orders ... It was not crowded outside ... got my drink fairly quickly, but my wife's never came.  The waitress finally, after maybe 15 more minutes, came to take our food (dinner salads only) orders - never coming back to offer a drink re-fill to me or additional bread.  When our order didn't come after 30 more minutes (about 1 hour total being there ... and, again, it was NOT crowded outside!!), we decided to leave.  I went inside and asked for a manager to tell her we were leaving and I would pay for my drink - and she was as pathetic as our waitress - only said she was sorry - never said something like ""please hold on, let me check to find out what's the problem"".  I then walked outside with her and pointed out our table where my wife was still sitting - she then walked back inside to a computer screen, presumably to see what we had ordered and when.   My wife later told me that while I was inside talking with the manager, the waitress came to our table with a drink re-fill for me and said she'd check on our meals (salads, no less) that had been ordered about 30 minutes prior, and my wife told the waitress that we were leaving and the waitress just said ""ok"", never apologizing or saying she would get a manager.  My wife then walked up and the manager never offered us anything such as a complimentary meal in the future, a take-out of our order for free, or even a dessert to go --- and she never said anything about finding out what had gone wrong - she just said, ""I'm sorry"" - right, that only goes so far. - pitiful customer service.  We've been to this Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter Mall many, many times, and told that to the manager, but that didn't seem to phase her.  We have never walked out of a restaurant due to poor service, but everyone failed here - absolutely the waitress, presumably the kitchen and definitely the manager.  BOTTOM LINE - WE WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE, NEVER!

Christie M.,"McKinney, TX",6,45,31,2.0,7/19/2017,Dinner was Ok. I was disappointed in a few items. There were 7 of us. Also my 7 year old daughter ordered cheese pizza and the waitress rung up and brought her a full size/full price which I was VERY unhappy with. I had skinilicous lemon crusted shrimp and the shrimp was over cooked there was not enough sauce on the pasta and the green beans were barely cooked (way less than aldente) our waitress was decent but very behind. We constantly had to ask for refills and really did not feel waited on.

Cynthia N.,"Atlanta, GA",480,367,227,3.0,7/30/2016,"I visit Cheesecake Factory when I don't want a surprise in my meal.  It's also a safe bet when meeting picky friends for lunch/dinner because CF has something for everyone.  If a person can't find something to eat at CF, they probably have a personality disorder.  (This makes it a great first date place!) They stopped serving my favorite snack - buffalo chicken meatballs.  They were so delicious and a perfect appetizer size.  I hate that they no longer carry them.  That being said, I console myself with the fresh kale salad and sausage and ricotta flatbread.  My favorite cheesecake is the key lime (... but I also like pumpkin when it's in season.)  I used to avoid CF because their portion sizes were so large but now with their small plate options, it's a much more reasonable place to consider for lunch or dinner.   I'm writing this review because I think people sleep on the good cocktails that are made at CF.  If you work in the area, the CF bar is a great place for happy hour.  The drink sizes are generous, suitably potent and worth their price point.  My favorites are the Mai Tai and J.W.'s Lemonade. You're not drinking a ""crafted cocktail"" but you're drinking a well-made cocktail and that's okay too. I usually sit at the bar here and service is okay.  I don't hate it but I don't love it.  They could be more attentive, but this isn't a five-star restaurant so we have to take what we get. *le sigh* Yelp 100 #46",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=60

We didn't have room for dessert but you can't go to cheesecake factory and not have cheesecake so we got a slice of vanilla bean with 6 spoons!  Simple but amazing creamy rich cheesecake.  It may be my favorite now.

Who eats cold chicken, potatoes, and asparagus? I told the manager, as he sped by our table, and first he said, in a very rough voice, ""what would you like me to do? I can reheat it or replace it"". My concern was waiting for another meal. Everyone else would be finished with theirs. I have been there at least 50 times in last 12 years of living here. It's our stop when family visits. Anyway, I was not sure how to respond so I said I'd like a replacement (no dried out meal for me), I'd like it to go, AND complimentary. He said that's not going to happen. He said, ""if I make a new meal, you'll pay for it"". Keep in mind, we've paid thousands over the course of 12 years and with large families visiting, we've had even larger bills. Is that Customer Focused? Addendum-- I have commented twice on your website. I'd like to speak with someone about this. It is more principle than anything else.

I always remember Cheesecake Factory as HUGE portions for the price you pay. I prefer getting the classics, and you can't go wrong with the Shepherd's Pie or the Meatloaf. Any of the pastas aren't bad as well. Everything here is quite heavy, and the cheesecakes are intimidating but the best (and unhealthiest) dessert ever. RED VELVET CHEESECAKE ftw. They offer a Skinny menu for healthier eating... but when you're at the Cheesecake Factory, why bother, just go all the way :)  Service is usually pretty good here. Although it's quite busy, I've never had to wait more than 10-20 minutes for a table, whatever the size of our group is (I've never been during a peak hour before though so that may be an inaccurate estimate). The servers are usually nice and friendly. One of my friends dropped his flatbread seconds after the server delivered it to our table. Although I'm sure both parties were at fault (the server set it down dangerously close to the edge, and my slightly buzzed friend brushed past the platter when standing up to go the bathroom, they quickly moved to replace it free of charge, as it should be.

Stuart B.,"Atlanta, GA",11,3,1,2.0,12/14/2016,"What a shame. These folks have a beautiful room with nice high ceilings, and kitschy, Hollywood movie set look, a gorgeous bar and plenty of space.  We were met with blank stares (by the afternoon manager) and shuffled off to a noisy seat by the kitchen after asking to be moved from a boring, cramped, two-top booth looking out to the side parking lot. I explained to the manager and staff that I was taking my son out for lunch after college finals and we wanted to enjoy the space (which was not at all crowded at 3:30 pm). Over the din of tacky tourist muzak and clattering plates and glasses, I asked that we move again, this time a little closer to the bar. Again, the room is nice and airy, but the tacky muzak just beats down on your mind and provides great cover for the waitrons to momentarily acknowledge the customer, throw stuff on the table and keep moving.  My son said his Kobe beef burger was great. My ""Jambalaya"" pasta was so-so...spicey and plentiful, but frozen shrimp and dry chicken place keepers were inexpertly prepared and presented.  ""Close...but no cigar"". The contempt by the manager and staff for the suckers whom wander in to overpay for the mediocre, loud tourist experience is pretty thinly veiled--but given cover by the relentless cacophony pressing down from above. Why unlock the doors and let folks in if you don't really want them there? I mean...show more love, man. Turn the Muzak down a little.  What a shame.

Rachel P.,"Schererville, IN",99,2,6,1.0,4/30/2017,I wish there was a way to rate this Cheesecake Factory less than one star because it doesn't even deserve one star. I don't even know where to begin. After we were seated it took a good 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence to get us drinks. We then waited an hour for our food & when we finally did get our food 3 out of 5 meals were cold. When we informed the waiter about it he asked if we would like him to heat it up for us and then informed us that the area where the pasta is cooked is not working properly so none of the pasta items were cooked correctly but still brought it to the table for us to eat knowing it was not up to standards. We also only saw our waiter maybe every 30 minutes. My friend ordered a lunch menu item and because we were there for so long they then charged her item as a dinner entree because lunch was now over. (Even though when we ordered our food it was still lunch) I think our drinks were refilled once in the 2+ hours we were there. The table next to us waited almost 20 minutes until their order was even taken & the table on the other side got up and left because no one ever came to help them.

I can understand not worrying about a table if it isn't yours but if you see menus on the table with no bread for an extended period of time, it's just curtious to ask if we have been helped. I honestly thought that we were being treated that way because the servers did not think we were going to tip them well. But it is not fair for someone to judge us before they even served us. We had to inform someone that we had not been seen. And even after we told the hostess we were still not seen.

We walked in, and was acknowledged and seated quickly. Our server was attentive, and and friendly (and easy on the eyes lol). I wasn't really hungry being that I had just left the mall, and screwed up my appetite there, so I opted for a small appetizer.  I chose the loaded baked potato tots. It was labeled as a baked tot filled with cheese, bacon, and green onions served with sour cream. Sounds promising, so I'm amped about trying it. When they reached the table, it looked like a freakin hush puppy. So, I'm like what in the bleu cheese hell, and decided to go for it anyway. Ughhhh, so disappointed. It was filled with something like fondue cheese, and I never tasted bacon. The green onions were sparsely thrown on top of the sour cream.

A G.,"Lithonia, GA",0,1,,1.0,3/23/2017,"To whom it may concern, This is a two-part story, I visited your Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter on 2 occasions and the experience was very unacceptable. 1st occasion, we went in January of 2017 on a Saturday around noon or so, we were placed in a booth; 15-20 mins passed; no server came and I decided this isn't going to go well, lets just leave. The restaurant was empty because it just opened therefore my motto is, if it don't feel right, just go. 2nd occasion, March 22nd, 2017.  We went after shopping and the wait was not long, maybe 15mins;  It was me, my son and girlfriend.  My Waiter-Marcus came and we ordered our drinks, food, and appetizer.  Everything rolling along fine until we placed our order.  Appetizer came out within 15mins, after that radio silence. My girlfriend ordered the turkey burger, I ordered the Gumbo, and my son order the Filet Mignon, therefore we were spending a good amount of money w/ drinks.  After 25-30 mins, we looking around like where is the food; Marcus comes by and says nonchalantly let me check on your food.  About 5 mins later (30-35 total),  turkey burger came and Gumbo. I ordered my gumbo w/ white rice which sits in the middle of the bowl, this one had brown rice. I told the server I order Gumbo w/ white rice. The server said here I will bring you out some white rice, I said no take this back, that is not what I ordered. He stated it only sits in the middle.  I am like, did he just try and give me a different version of what I order and wanted me to make the adjustments on the plate that I am paying for.  I told him to take the plate back and bring it out correctly.  During this point our server Marcus is no-where to be found in response to the mishap.  And notice, I did not mention my sons plate, because he hasn't received it.  So now, here comes my corrected Gumbo w/ white rice, no apology or anything.  Also here comes the Filet Mignon w/ mashed potatoes and green beans. My son ordered a Filet Mignon w/ French fries and broccoli. We look at the plate and say, are you serious?  Mind you that's a $30 dollar dish, at this point Marcus appears and I inform him, this is not what we ordered, His response, "" I'll bring him out some fries and broccoli"" (i.e No accountability or apology).  He brings out a bowl of broccoli and unseasoned fries, and says my bad to my son.  At this point, Marcus isn't even worth eye contact because I'm upset. I am the type of person that if good service and quality food is provided, I will forever patron your restaurant.  Because, I can count on feeling good about the entire experience.  I don't know why the service was so horrible nor do I care because I am the customer and Marcus was the face of Cheesecake at that point.  You had 3 orders, got 1 right and 2 wrong, that's 33.3%; that's below failing.  I hate when people do not tip and give good service a hard time, but on occasions like these, I see no reason for anyone to hold back if they want that type of confrontation.  Me, I am a little more reserved and better voicing my opinion in other ways, such as this.   Finally when the check comes, there isn't an apology or nothing.  I am like this is ridiculous.  I expect more from a location such as yours and its disheartening knowing people aren't treated with the type of service they are paying for, And the only reason Marcus got a tip which was 14.00 dollars on a 100.00 tab is because we chose to come and eat there.  But, let that had been no tip, the only comment would have been, black people don't tip, even though the service you provided was awful; between you and the kitchen staff.   I am not a waiter but if I was, my main goal would be to provide the type of service that you cant deny giving me an exceptional tip no matter what is going on in my life, that is blocked out because I am working.

Saira K.,"Atlanta, GA",149,1047,403,5.0,1/20/2014,"I would not have expected to give The Cheesecake Factory such a high rating, but their lemoncello cream torte is worthy of 5 stars. Absolutely delectable layers of vanilla cake and lemon mascarpone cream are topped with streusel and served with strawberries, syrup, and whipped cream, and I think I tasted lady fingers as well. The cake is so moist and soaks up the strawberry syrup, strawberry juice, and lemon mascarpone. You can see the photo I posted. The mixture of the strawberry and lemon made it taste like passion fruit. I am not a fan of their cheesecake; I find it too soft and lacking in taste, and it just doesn't have the right texture - I am quite smug about the cheesecake I bake (my secret recipe), although ordering cheesecake is fun here because of all the choices. The rest of the menu is just okay; this is a chain. I was recently in Austria and Germany and was terribly disappointed by the desserts there, even in Vienna's famous cafes. The lemoncello here is superior to what I had there, and they got the streusel just right; the mascarpone is uniquely done!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=200
Thomas L.,"Norcross, GA",26,87,4,3.0,3/6/2014,"I don't normally enjoy writing reviews about corporate, chain restaurants. Firstly, I believe their atmosphere and theme to be silly and derivative, and secondly, I'd rather spend my money on an establishment where the money flows more directly into the community. With that said, I recently visited the Cheesecake Factory at the Perimeter Mall and it warrants a review, for reasons both good and not so good.  To begin with, the interior of the restaurant looks like something one would find at Disneyworld - this is to say somewhat cute, an obvious attempt to come across as attractive. I don't even know where to begin to describe the décor or this place - it had fake columns reminiscent of the Classical world,  carved faces in the fashion of the Aztecs and Mayans, and painted ceilings resembling poor man's imitation of Michelangelo. Weird, but not outright unattractive.  The Cheesecake Factory is always busy and doesn't take reservations on weekend nights during peak  hours. This means you will wait for 15 - 30 minutes to be seated. That's not so bad, but even though the restaurant is quite large, it's also cramped and loud making conservation quite difficult. The service is definitely friendly. I was asked, ""How are you tonight, sir?"" multiple times (which I presume to be a dictat from on high to the staff) but it's not very snappy, either. This is to be expected and forgiven in such a busy establishment, though. That said, it's not somewhere I'd recommend you go out for a date night or an intimate and relaxing dinner.  The menu is very extensive, almost overwhelming. Personally, I prefer a restaurant that trims downs it menu and focuses on doing several things very well, but the Cheesecake Factory takes the opposite, broader approach.  Now, to the most important part - the food. It's nothing to write home about but I certainly didn't leave hungry, either. I had the fried macaroni balls for the appetizer - rich and filling, and chicken pot stickers for dinner. I've certainly had better pot stickers, but they were quite good, served with a slightly crispy shell, chicken and seasoned with ginger soy sauce. I cleaned my plate and have no real complaint to deliver about the fare, but no accolades, either.  The drinks are a bit on the pricey end of normal. The house wine is $8.00 and the Lemon Drop I ordered was $10. Not outrageous, but more than what one would pay at a similar corporate chain restaurant.  Finally, the place is called Cheesecake Factory for a reason. Numerous varieties of that delicious pastry are available and if you like them as much as do I, you won't be disappointed. Personally, the Red Velvet is my favorite, but I plan on trying the numerous other varieties over time. Finally, The Cheesecake Factory is a  restaurant that does what it does without having a unique experience and serves good, though not exceptional food. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to eat here, but if you know what you're getting into, and want to take home a delicious cheesecake for a midnight snack, give it a shot.  Pros: CHEESECAKES. Extensive menu means that even pick eaters will be able to find something they enjoy. Cons: Not much to offer in terms of ambiance, and while the food food is nominally good, nothing stands. Verdict: Recommended IF someone else is paying, or a group can't decide what kind of good to eat that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=200

Never!) the service is remarkably subpar. Not only is it usually slow, but I've had a few waiters be downright inattentive to the point of rude. I have a suspicion it is because I'm usually with my younger siblings (high school/early college aged) and they assume that because we're all relatively young that we don't tip well. On the contrary, my standard tip is 20%, with percentage deducted only for bad service, and all my dining companions tip the same way. We're never rowdy or rude, so I am really shocked to see that this behavior by the waiters is a pattern and not a fluke.

And the manager at this location is not very polite. I went with a group of my girlfriends and we are seniors in high school. They treated us with no respect as if we were children which pissed me off. Just because we are not adults does not mean you can give less service to us. I mean we are paying customers. So we wait for 45 minutes then we were seated at a table that was too small for the 8 of us. They made us get up and wait another 30 - 45 minutes. So by the time we were sitting down we were pretty mad. We all ordered and the waitress was nice but still awful service. We received the food after we waited for another 30 minutes. It looked appealing but it was actually below average. The food here is really not that good. The only good thing worth ordering here is the cheesecake but honestly it's not even worth sitting down and having a meal. I suggest if you ever go here just order cheesecake and pick it up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=200

Then another waiter came apologized for the confusion, took drink order, appetizer order and main entree order.  I thought we were on the right path when the drinks and hot bread (full serving) with butter arrived at our table within 5 mins.  Waited another 25 mins - no appetizer or waiter.

Shaun W.,"Snellville, GA",38,7,8,3.0,9/20/2014,"My family and I arrived at the restaurant just before 9pm after spending the evening shopping. We were told there would be a 40 minute wait, we were given a pager and we sat outside to wait. After noticing that the majority of the other guests that were waiting had been seated, I checked with the hostess to find out how much longer our wait would be. When I handed the hostess my pager she looked in the system and she seemed very confused. She checked with another hostess because she could not find our pager number in the system. He told her he paged us already and went back to what he was doing. The original hostess told me to go get the rest of my party and that we would be seated right away. I did that and when we got back to the desk they continued to seat other parties. I finally had to ask if they were going to seat us and eventfully our name was called. I immediately asked to speak to a manager and I explained the situation. She said it's not their fault the pager didn't work. I, of course, understand that if it was true that we received a busted pager, it obviously wasn't their fault but a simple apology would have diffused the situation and in all of my years in customer service, I've never told an angry customer that something wasn't my fault.  The manager did offer to comp an appetizer after I expressed my extreme displeasure with the service I received but when the bill came, the ""free"" appetizer had not been taken off.

Judy L.,"Atlanta, GA",519,285,1922,5.0,11/11/2011,"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to. I've been visiting this location for years now. I'm finally writing a review. I came here a few nights ago with 20+ people for a birthday party. The bad thing about big party reservations is that the whole party has to be there or else they can't hold it for you.  I always order the spaghetti with meat sauce. They take a simple American classic dish and makes it as good as it can get. This dish never fails me. However, this time, I wanted to try other dishes they had on their menu. I ordered off of their specialties selection of their menu. I ordered the chicken bellagio. It is a ""Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad"" as described on their menu. It was good, however, I'm not a fan of the thin fried chicken ""steaks"" or patties. The pasta was good, surprisingly, with the arugula salad (that I mixed with it). It also comes with a thinly sliced ham on top of the salad. The server described it as ""pork"". Overall, it was pretty good. I still had a lot left over because the portions are really big. My boyfriend ordered thai chicken pasta which was very delish. It is cooked with green and ""normal"" pasta with chunks of chicken with bean sprouts. Sort of like pad thai. We also ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It is one of the best calamari I've ever had. It comes with marinara and tartar sauce. My boyfriend ordered the coke and tequila mixed (coke & jose cuervo) drink which he didn't think was mixed well.  Also, the cheesecake here is very good also. I didn't order it this time for we brought in a birthday cake. Their dessert menu is very extensive.

Blake W.,"Atlanta, GA",39,195,87,3.0,8/21/2017,"I really debated between 2 and 3 stars. I ultimately went with 3, because to get a 2 from me there usually has to be something definitively wrong with the place. And there is nothing wrong per se with Cheesecake Factory at Perimeter.  I just do not find the food special, and for the price it really should be something special.  This location is located at Perimeter Mall.  It gets pretty busy as most Cheesecake Factories. Being at a mall there is usually not a major issue parking, just a matter of how close you can get.  There are plenty of jokes around about the size of the menu at the Cheesecake Factory.  It certainly has a huge selection. I tend to suspect that is why nothing is special. If you try to be everything, then nothing is great. Some of the best places in my opinion have a few things they do, and they do them well.  Last time I went to Cheesecake Factory it was me and my wife for lunch. I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and my wife had a not memorable pasta dish. No alcohol and our bill was almost $40.  Again, nothing wrong with the food. The food was just okay and the service was fine.

This location is attached to the mall and I think you must enter from outside.  They have a bar, Togo and dining area  I never order alcoholic drinks here because they're expensive and youll need a few to get a buzz. But if you want a super expensive smoothie, be my guest. They do have happy hour but I don't remember at what time but you sit in the bar high tops and order from a happy hour menu.  Their food is kinda pricey, but it's good so I keep coming back. They have a few selections on the lunch menu but this time I ordered a burger since those are priced the same. Also, the macaroni and cheese burger was awesome! They put all the toppings like lettuce, tomato, etc on the side, and they gave me honey mustard on request. They make their own so it's really good. They also sell all their sauces up front in to go.  You should also try such items as avocado eggrolls because if you love avocados, it's pretty much a must! Also, the chicken Bellagio is a pasta dish that packs some flavor without looking like it's doing a whole lot.  Don't do the artichoke appetizer; it's a whole artichoke so you're going to be biting each tint edible bit off of each hard non edible bit. Too much work for the price  And the cheesecake is so worth the cost! They also have an amazing tiramisu. They also come out with a new flavor every few months and feature it on the back.  It's a small put off that the menu has ads (yes I know.. it shocked me too at first) but just ignore them and keep turning pages.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=20

Dawn D.,"Atlanta, GA",4,82,84,5.0,12/24/2016,"An annual tradition has us at Perimeter Mall, at 1130am, to enjoy a great holiday lunch during this busy season. Service was staffed accordingly as we strolled in quickly and we're seated in less than 60 seconds.  If anyone has ever been to this place, you know the decor, menu, bar and dessert area is all the rave. The menu boasts 45 pages at last count, with too many options for you to consider in the 5 minutes the server leaves you to decide the next phase of your journey. Joy, our server was phenomenal! She offered her suggestions as I asked because our party of 4 has some questions and I was on the fence with going to my 'old trusty' or venturing out to something new. We ended up with sliders, fries for a meal, fished tacos, salad/black beans, and Monte Cristo sandwiches.  The hibiscus lemonade is the bomb-not too sweet and won't send you into diabetic shock, lol. Considering we were ordering dessert, we definitely wanted to snag some cheesecake on out way out, we ate light today. When the food arrived, it came out hot, fast and correct. This establishment rarely gets the order wrong, although I admit I almost ordered my son's food incorrect if I had not been reminded to add cheese to his sliders, and just ketchup and nothing else. Our server Joy was very friendly and gracious and make the adjustment immediately.  As I stated before, we arrived before noon, so we saw a ample supply of empty tables, however that changed by noon- almost 50% capacity. The bar boasts a big screen TV where you're invited to chat with the bartender or servers. The temperature was nice enough for outdoor seating although I wasn't sure if that's an option this time of year. We ended our experience on our way out and ordered some cheesecake. The original, and the pumpkin pecan. Yummy!

I had strawberry lemonade that was the bomb! Their portions are big you will have leftovers.

Then I asked her what's popular and she didn't even reply. My date didn't order anything becauee of it.

Today I ordered the House Salad and Pizza combo from their lunch menu.  The house salad consists of greens with tomatoes and choice of dressing.  The pizza options are from the regular menu, it is just a bit smaller on the lunch menu.  I am usually a big fan of their food, but today, even though the pizza had lots of toppings, I had to eat it with a fork because the middle was soggy. :(  I'm hoping this was a fluke - as I have not had this issue in the past.

Food was kind of lackluster and bland. Normally when you think of Cheesecake Factory you think gargantuan portions. Not the case today.  Overall our server was not attentive, she was too busy talking with another employee. The only reason for more than 1 star, is their cheesecake is still pretty decent.

In the attempt to correct the problem, the manager returns with herbs heated on top of the grilled salmon which was totally incorrect. Herb crusted salmon is not grilled!

And if you're a fan of blueberry and a fan of martinis (girly ones, not grown man ones with the olives), order a Cosmo with Stoli Blueberry. You can thank me later.  My favorite dishes (that are still on the menu) - Chicken Picatta, Hamburgers (Yes, I know it's the CF, but their burgers are AWESOME), Chicken Littles, Avocado Eggrolls, Buffalo Blasts, Shrimp Scampi, Herb Crusted and Grilled Salmon, Southern Fried Catfish, and a few of the combination platters. Please make sure you're ready to work this food off, because the portions are huge and the calorie counts are NOT low, for the most part. Budget your calories for this place, especially if you plan on having cheesecake (which is also amazing). The menu is extensive, so if you've got indecisive or picky eaters, this is usually a good ""compromise"" spot. They'll even customize your food for you (within reason). Amazing food, amazing drinks, usually amazing service (It ranges from good to amazing, but I've never been to a CF and had BAD, let me complain to the manager service) - I still love this place.

This was probably the first time I had been in a Cheesecake Factory in years... and it was disappointing.  It's great that they put how much calories their food contains on their menu, but this sucked in the sense that I went from wanting a cheesecake to not wanting one at all because of how much calories are in these slices of cheesecake. The cheesecakes I originally wanted to try were all around ~1500 calories per slice... Wow, that's about all the daily caloric intake I need in one whole day. I ended up compromising for a tiramisu cheesecake which had just a little below 1000 calories. The cheesecake was just okay. It may have been in the freezer/fridge for a bit too long because the cake portion of the cheesecake had a stale fridge taste to it (like it's been soaking up the smell of whatever else was in the fridge with it).  Also, the bathroom was not clean at all and there were no toilet paper or paper towels anywhere.

""Renee's Special""  (who's Renee?) is a good deal.  Half turkey or chicken salad sandwich, a bowl of soup AND a salad for $12.50. Well looky here: they brought me a whole sandwich!  But the chicken salad was null and void.  Right proportion of chicken to mayo, but not enough zing.  Rather than a choice of soups -- surely they should have at least two -- the restaurant only prepares one per day.  Yesterday's soup du jour was 'loaded potato': thick, gloppy, highly caloric, not my thing.  (For what it's worth, Ellen enjoyed hers.)   The field green salad was fine -- a good-sized portion -- and the balsamic vinaigrette dressing -- ""on the side, please"" -- was excellent. Our server was an adorable, on-the-ball college student, so we were well taken care of .

Honesty G.,"Atlanta, GA",0,11,6,1.0,1/5/2018,"The cake nightmare!!! I am DONE with Cheesecake Factory. We ordered a Oreo cheesecake for a colleague's birthday with her name written on top. You have to pay extra for the name to be written on a special card to place on the cake.  Upon picking up the cake from CF, the girl proceeded to tell us that they do not have anymore cards, and the name was not written on the cake for that reason. She was not apologetic by any means. She actually looked annoyed. How could you be annoyed? You're not the one that has to give a birthday cake to someone without their name on it. Personalizing a birthday cake is how people feel special on their birthday. This is a very important part, not to mention the fact that we are spending OVER $50 for this cake! Why didn't anyone call us!? Why is the girl behind the counter having an attitude?  Finally the manager comes over, his name was Patrick. He was very nice and at least tried. He wrote the name on the cake. It was not the prettiest but he tried. I gave one star bc he tried. In the future, do not have an attitude with the customer, it isn't their fault that your inventory is not correct and we were not notified. Also if you're going to work in the bakery, and have an attitude, maybe you should work in the back. Bake the cookies, rather eat a cookie and have a smile! She needs a new job. She is lucky she didn't have her name tag on! Patrick thanks for trying... but after $50 that is ridiculous! To others just go to Publix and buy a cake.

If you are looking for a place with an extensive menu and a plethora of cheesecakes then this is the place to go. Now about the Perimeter Mall location...whoever the young lady was working take-out two weeks ago, she had a very sour attitude and lied to me about them discontinuing a menu item after we had a disagreement on the name of the item. I was trying to order cauliflower wings and she stated that they did not sell those. After a few seconds of back and forth and having her get a menu for me, she informed me that they are called Korean fried cauliflower and that that menu item has been discontinued. Therefore, that day I left only with a slice of pumpkin cheesecake. Well then, why to my surprise did I go back to CF this past weekend and I was magically able to order the Korean fried cauliflower? Smh, not a way to build customer rapport. Also, I don't know when or why restaurants started doing this, but there were three people in my party and each person got their food at a different time, the last person getting his 20-25 minutes after the second person.

Unfortunately, today was different.  It was National Cheesecake Day but we arrived around 11am while the restaurant was still half empty.  I ordered the Spinach and Cheese dip and Cajun Jambalaya pasta.  The food was served in a timely manner and the food tasted great.  But aside from taking our initial order, our server was nowhere to be found.  We waited and waited for drink refills or for anyone to check on our table. Once we were done with the food, we were ready to order dessert.  My dining partner ordered a cheesecake and I ordered the Apple Cobbler.  We also asked for drink refills.  A few minutes later, the server returned to inform me that the restaurant sold out of Apple Cobbler.  Not a big deal if this was a mom and pop restaurant but this is a billion dollar company that should be better at supply chain management.  Worse yet, I never got my refill.  If he hadn't taken my glass, I could have quenched my thirst with the melting ice but with no glass, I just finished my meal and ate dessert without a drink. Our server was friendly but hardly present. Not sure if he was inexperienced or if the restaurant was understaffed.  Either way, the service was below expectations for the Cheesecake Factory.   I hope this was an isolated experience and not the new standard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2
Charlie H.,"Lawrenceville, GA",7,4,5,4.0,8/1/2017,"I should be coming here for the desert right? Nope! Not to say that their Cheesecakes are bad, because they are anything but, I actually really like their food! If anyone has seen the menu, then you will know right away that the menu is more like a short story book rather than a typical menu, which some people will have a problem with, but I don't mind too much. During my most recent visit to this establishment, which was indeed quite recent, I have to say, I was quite impressed with how everything went! Usually when I do go to Cheesecake Factory, I always expect slow service, like really slow... However, to much of my party's surprise, everything went quite smooth and efficient. Whenever we are around this area, especially around dinner time, there are always a lot of options to choose from. So when we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory, we were expecting to wait 30-45 minutes (at least) to be seated, however, it only took us 15 minutes to be seated! I think that should be considered an all time record, especially since it was during a weekend afternoon. So after we got seated, we were greeted by a very lovely server, named Nikki (sorry if not spelled correctly). She took our drink orders and in no time at all, we had our drinks. She was also very fast in bringing our bread and butter, and if you know me, I love me some complimentary bread! After our table basically devoured the bread, she was so kind to ask us if we wanted more, and of course I said yes. Again, her service was exceptionally fast! Whenever I do go out with the family, we sometimes decide to eat family style (sharing entrees) which we did for this night, after we ordered our food, she brought us extra entree size plates without us having to ask. Again, Cheesecake Factory has a good amount of things to choose from, and whenever I go, I have to have at least one pasta entree (they make good pastas!). Because their portions are quite large, you could easily share one entree for two people. We ended up getting a Pasta Carbonara w/o chicken ($16.50), a Crispy Chicken Costoletta ($17.95), and a Factory Chopped Salad ($12.50). The food came out within 15-25 minutes and everything tasted great! The Carbonara is always made well, the chicken was seasoned well and had a nice crispy bite to it, and the salad was delicious, dressed with just the right amount of dressing. I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 because the service for this particular day was phenomenal, again, thanks to our server Nikki, and the food was superb. If they continue with this type of great service, as well as continuing serving good food, this place will easily be a 5 star for me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2

Apparently many of my Atlantans have been keeping this secret. Well NO MORE! I had the best French toast brioche I've ever had in my life! It was soft fluffy flavorful and most of all yummy! Lol. The texture is unlike anything I've ever had. I can't really describe it. You've got to experience it for yourself. It was so good I had to ask for the manager. April, the manager, was as sweet as can be. She detailed how the brioche actually soaks overnight for this extravagant tasty outcome. Wow.  I am amazed yet again. Thank you Cheesecake Factory.

Helen K.,"Atlanta, GA",124,466,4024,4.0,1/28/2017,"Its my bestie's favorite so its not so uncommon that we'll end up here if we can't decide where to eat.   Cheesecake is a chain and it differs from location to location but we prefer this one over Buckhead due to convenience being a central location and that they still carry chicken luau salad that Buckhead doesn't. Though Cheesecake can be a headache with long waits and too many options, its always the perfect option to cater to all cravings.  Yesterday, I finally satisfied my craving of a burger with the skinnylicious burger.  Though I didn't really eat skinnylicious when I ate a good portion of my fiance's Louisiana chicken salad on top of their bread lol. That brings me to their awesome Hawaiian and sour dough bread! Try to tame yourself though, you get all your carbs before the actual meal, which we usually do.   Typically we come to cheesecake without getting cheesecake due to the HUGE portion sizes here but great for sharing.  Some of our favorite plates are:    -Luau chicken salad that comes with crispy wonton flakes that you break up with tangy and sweet dressing -Louisiana chicken pasta - flash fried chicken cutlets with peppery and creamy bowtie pasta -Pasta carbonara that's creamy and bacony with a spoonful of green peas (That counts as veggies!) This is one of my favs but totally made out of carbs, hence the name. -Cajun jambalaya pasta - Bountiful of chicken and shrimp with fresh tomatoes on top.  Pretty tasty! -Chicken lettuce wraps - Awesome taco alternatives by substituting the tortilla.  Flavored with Asian sweet sauce. And the list is endless... But on top of it all, they have skinnylicious cocktails so you don't have to skimp out on Friday night celebration or any celebration. IF you have room for cheesecake, I would highly recommend the banana pudding cheesecake.  Even for those who doesn't like cheesecake will like this with fresh bananas and cheesecake so airy and fluffy with light, refreshing banana flavor. Cheesecake offers all and will leave you full everytime! Its just the day after your scale will snap you into reality hehe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2
Jay S.,"Jefferson, GA",44,68,159,3.0,11/23/2014,"I always here the hype of this place for so long and finally decided to go here with my gf cause she was craving a dish there. My first impressions, the interior was pretty nice, we got seated pretty quick, our service was great, we ordered some calamari to start it off and for our mains we ordered the Chicken Marsala and Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic . Both dishes were very good, but also very very heavy, we ended up not even finishing our dishes. For dessert i ordered some strawberry short cake and some chocolate cake for my gf, both were very good.Overall i think thought the food was actually pretty good, but just too heavy for me, i actually like to finish all my food and enjoy my dinner. Maybe next time i'll try ordering something else. But for those who haven't been here, id say it good to try it once if you havent, i'd prolly go back there sometime but maybe not anytime soon. I ended up spending about 70dollars total for dinner but didn't really seem satisfied. Different strokes for different folks tho.

Ronald W.,"Alpharetta, GA",42,9,40,4.0,12/5/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is very similar to their other Atlanta locations: decent drinks, good menu, and delicious cakes. I just took my date to this location tonight, so my review will be based off my isolated-experience: this restaurant was good, and does deserve my 4-star review. The main reason I took ""one star off"" is, like my fellow consumers, the Cheesecake reservation system sucks (in my opinion). Granted, this location is next to Perimeter Mall, and the restaurant is always overwhelm with customers (so I don't blame them for not implementing a tradition ""Call-ahead reservation system"". Thus, I will leave my review with a question to the Cheesecake Factory management: At peak customer-traffic time, is there any way that you can improve the crowded-ness of your Customer Waiting Line? Just tonight, I had to pass 20+ people just to get to your hostess... (just my two-cents)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=140

Jon B.,"Mendham Borough, NJ",4,151,76,1.0,4/18/2016,I have to agree with most everyone on here. Service is terrible. Painfully slow even when restaurant is empty. I'm guessing management just sits in the back and doesn't care what happens. Food averages 35 minutes to get no matter how basic- salad 35 minutes. Glass of tea- 35 minutes-  basket of bread 35 minutes. You get the picture?

Angela S.,"Smyrna, GA",362,568,2414,3.0,9/7/2012,"(Note: Since it's been a very long time since I'd last dined inside this particular Cheesecake Factory, this review is specifically for the take out section.) After enjoying our lunch at Maggiano's Little Italy on a Sunday afternoon, my sister wanted dessert, but not just any kind.  My sister was craving GOOD cheesecake, and she wanted to treat me, too!  =)  Since it was blazing hot that day, I drove the (incredibly) short distance from Maggiano's to park closer to this Cheesecake Factory. We walked straight to the take out counter, which is on the right as soon as you enter the restaurant.  There was one customer in front of us, and since my sister and I pretty much knew what we wanted, we had made our decisions on which cheesecakes we wanted by the time the customer was done ordering. To make a long story short, the employee taking orders at the cash register was busy taking orders over the phone and preparing take out meals.  We stood and waited at least five minutes before she finally took our cheesecake orders, and we specifically requested whipped cream to be included on the side (since I wasn't sure whether they always provided whipped cream).  After ordering and paying, we waited another ten minutes or so for our cheesecakes.  The employee was not friendly or apologetic about the delay. When we finally got our cheesecakes, we looked at both to ensure we got the right ones and that they had whipped cream.  Neither included whipped cream, and one order was incorrect.  My sister had ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, but she got the Oreo one instead.  WOW.  So we requested the whipped cream again, which they put in plastic containers.  And, of course, my sister notified them of the mistake they made. If you've never ordered the Red Velvet cheesecake, you should know that it is a HUGE slice, so it's put in a plastic container that is larger than the standard cheesecake slice container.  The container is large enough to fit a huge salad.  However, instead of putting the large container in a plastic bag for her to carry, the employee simply handed it over to her.  Per my suggestion to request a bag, my sister got one because it would have been awkward to carry the large container, and of course there's a higher risk of dropping it on the way to my car without a bag.   Once we got home, we didn't eat our cheesecakes right away since they were no longer cold.  We put them in the fridge for a few hours and let them chill so that we could enjoy them later. * Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake ($6.95) - Per the menu description, this is a ""Silky Chocolate Cheesecake Topped with a Layer of Belgian Chocolate Mousse.""  Although I'm normally not a dessert person, I am a huge fan of chocolate mousse.  This cheesecake was as delicious as it sounds.  I just love the smooth texture of mousse, and it isn't overly rich like regular chocolate frosting.  You must put a bit of whipped cream on each bite!  Yuuuum...  =) * Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake ($7.95) - ""Moist layers of Red Velvet Cake and our Original Cheesecake covered with our special Cheesecake Factory cream cheese frosting.""  It's HEAVENLY.  There isn't much else to say, but I really like that there isn't an overly cheesy/milky aftertaste as some red velvet cakes have.  I definitely want to get this one next time! Overall, The Cheesecake Factory (take out section ONLY) at Perimeter Mall gets 3.5 stars because the cheesecake is amazing, but service wasn't.  The cheesecake itself easily deserves 5 stars.  So good!  I know this will sound crazy, but their Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake is the best red velvet that I have ever tasted!  I can't believe I had never tried it until recently.  I highly recommend you try it if you haven't already!

According to the manager it had been a very busy weekend and supply couldn't meet up with demand. Overall our food was good, miso salmon was excellent and so was the pork chop and the fish and chips.

Thomas L.,"Atlanta, GA",8,79,33,3.0,4/5/2015,"Almost every Cheesecake Factory I go to seems to always be packed. The Perimeter Mall location is not really an exception, you might be able to eat at a lull sometimes but I've seen this place be busy at 3 PM or 9 PM, so it's a bit of a crapshoot. Cheesecake factory always has a huge menu of options, like any place with so many options you'll get some things that are better than others. The fried mac and cheese appetizers are really good, they give you 4 and that will fill 2 people up before any entree itself. I've had entrees like chicken parm, philly cheesesteak, and some of the pasta dishes. I think overall the quantity is huge, they give you a lot for what you're paying. The food doesn't always taste quite cohesive, for example the philly cheesesteak has too many large peppers that kind overpower the meat. Service and quality can be variable sometimes, when it gets busy it can be hard to get a waiter or waitress, and i agree with some of the comments that you might notice a few dirty plates/utensils because they didn't clean it well (perhaps they just put it in a washer without scrubbing completely). I do think they try to make the place clean but with so much foot traffic the quality of cleanliness seems to drop sometimes. Overall it kinda does feel like a factory, there's large quantities of decent food at ok prices, but a lot of small details can get overlooked with service and cleanliness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=140

I said ok, asked for my check, and left the restaurant.  I'm certain that I will never return.  When I walk into any establishment spending my money, I expect to be treated with the upmost respect for my time and for my money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=140

Edward T.,"Marietta, GA",182,7,3,3.0,10/30/2016,"Finally got to try this place after years of hearing about it. First off, when we got there at about 7pm on a Saturday, they told us to wait 1 hr 15 min. Ended up having to wait 1 hr 35 min. After we got seated, we waited for about 15 minutes before the waitress came to give us our drinks. I understand that the restaurant is busy and all, but having to wait that long for just drinks is indicative of either the restaurant being understaffed or having incompetent servers. After waiting another 10-15 minutes, OUR BREAD FINALLY CAME OMGG. Bread was great, especially the rye. about 5 minutes later, my food came. I ordered the popular chicken dish with asparagus and mashes potatoes. Really enjoyed it, especially the chicken. Gf ordered some pasta with bacon, pasta, and mushroom. 20 minutes later, we received the check. We literally waited for our food twice as long as it took them to give us our check.

That's AWESOME of the management and host to do. The food portions are great, and the menu is overwhelming with everything from breakfast, to pan pizzas and ""asian"" inspired fusion food and ""Italian"" dishes.  Overall, they do do well at not serving super authentic food that manages to still taste really good. The portions are huge, and good for sharing family style. The bread that is served with the food is DELICIOUS, fresh and warm. I go for the dark bread only. Their mojitos are well made, some with Trinidadian 10 Cane Rum (MY FAVE), and are well mixed. Not strong drinks though they have strong drink club prices. The cheesecake or dessert will run you anothe $6 to $10 so it's NOT a cheap date-- and at over 1000 calories a slice, it's not waistline friendly, either. Eater beware and budgets beware.

There may be some I would like but I don't plan on trying everyone.  I would like to see a smaller cheesecake menu.  With all that said our server, Anthony was great.  A few minute after we received our entrees he came back to ask how everything was, which in recent years has been nonexistent by other servers. He was prompt, very considerate, friendly but not overly.  At the very end after I signed the check, which he did not see, he again thanked me and shook my hand.  This time the CF was nearly a 5 star, the only negative was the tile floors throughout the restaurant were slightly grease.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=180

It tends be very busy during the weekends. I have been here for lunch several times during the weekday and it's not as noisy, which is relaxing when you can actually hear the music.  I have been here numerous amount of times over the year. I remember celebrating a birthday dinner here about 4-5 years ago and at the time, they accommodated my large party with reservations prior to the event. I don't think they do it anymore based on some recent reviews I've read.  FOOD/DESSERT: Pretty good food and portion for the price. I love their calamari and tex-mex egg rolls appetizer. For entrees, they have an extensive menu ranging from items such as pasta to burgers to salads. They also have a SKINNYLICIOUS menu for folks watching their calories. That's always a cool thing.  Cheesecake is pretty good as well as their cakes. I tend to get the fruity cheesecakes such as the Mango Key Lime (comes with macaroon crust, which is coconutty) or chocolate-based cheesecakes.

One thing I never understand at this Cheesecake Factory is that they call my buzzer and let me wait for another 10 minutes every time. Anyway, our waiter seated us. At first his service was pretty decent, he took our order very carefully, even kneed down to the floor because he couldn't hear us very well. We ordered bufflo chicken meatball and decided to share Louisiana chicken pasta since we decided to save up our appetite for some cheesecake! He offered us water as we wanted pretty fast and then VANISHED. And things went down from this point. Nobody brouht us any bread or butter, we just sat for our meals with an empty stomach for over 20 minutes since the restaurant was packed. Here comes the worst part, our meal came out before our appetizer! How ridiculous was this! My boyfriend and I were so starving that we even didn't care about this ""accident"". The waiter who  brought our entree ( not our waiter) heard about our meatball didn't come, he asked us whether wanted to wait for it first, we just too eager to eat and  let it go. When we almost half done with our meal, the appetizer came out,  as I imagined, it was cold. I don't know how long it was seated under the heat lamp but it was definitely not fresh. I was pretty irritated by what happened there, but to this moment, our waiter even didn't show up once to check on us or refill up our water. I just finished our meal really quickly and decided to leave ASAP. Right before we finished our pasta he showed up with the dessert menu, I just ignored him and asked for the bill.

Heidi P.,"Marietta, GA",806,491,1824,3.0,3/27/2014,"This is probably the first time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in maybe 8-9 years... okay maybe longer. All I had remembered the menu is HUGE and the cheesecake is tasty.  We were going to get Mexican, but it was 5pm and the height of rush hour.. we sat for 15-20 minutes and didn't even get barely a mile. We were both in the ""I'm too hungry to talk to you, be nice to you, or not scream in traffic"" kind of mood, so we pulled into the mall, thinking we'd just walk around and get something from the cafeteria.. and then we walked towards Cheesecake Factory, because of where we parked, and we decided to give it a go. We were sat pretty quickly. I noticed it was in the middle of happy hour and waited a few minutes for drinks and bread. One lady walked by and dropped off some bread, some rye? pumpernickel? with oats?  I don't know, but it's good.  I think it's the same as O-u-t-b-a-c-k bread actually. AN-Y-way, We ordered about 10 minutes in.. we finished our bread and almost our drinks..  and before I knew it, we had been sitting there for over 40 minutes and still no food, no bread refill. The table that showed up after us, was getting their food. I was sure they didn't order before us.. I was about to get angry, when our food was placed in front of us. He got a turkey avocado sandwich, which he inhaled, with sweet potato fries.. which we brought home. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, which besides sounding like a fancy-as-$#@! name, is delicious. Crispy baked chicken on top of basil pasta with a bit of a buttery creamy sauce, with prosciutto and arugula and parmesan cheese on top of that.  The first bite was delicious.. and then then next and the next and the next.. and soon I realized how RICH and savory it really was, and decided to box up over half of the plate to bring home.  The waitress came back by and we asked for the check and a piece of the Adam's chocolately peanut buttery fudge ripple cheesecake to go.  We ate it later at home and it did not disappoint. Overall, if the food sucked, this place would be a 1 or 2 star experience, because tonight's service was not impressive.  However, we both really enjoyed our meals, so there's your saving grace. After all, the actual food can have an impact on how you feel about a restaurant.. sometimes. We have a bunch of food leftover, and I'm not sure if I'd go back necessarily, unless someone specifically requested it, or it was the only thing open, but 3 stars for this experience.

Annie L.,"Atlanta, GA",715,926,1252,5.0,6/25/2010,"I absolutely love this place. Particularly the location. I've been to the Northpoint Cheesecake Factory and the service is a hit or miss there...fortunately, I can say it's a steady flow of amazing-ness service at the Perimeter location =] Yes it's a chain restaurant. Yes it is commercialized. But you know what? What business isn't? I also understand the menu is freaking HUGE but I kinda like that...I can go for a sandwich, salad, pasta, pizza, burger, steak, soup, blah blah blah. They even have orange chicken. I mean, if you want a crowd pleaser I'd recommend going here. I love the cobb salad. With bits of bacon, diced up eggs, avocado slices, chunks of chicken (to be honest, I can do without that but I'll take what I can get), blue cheese crumbles....ahhh. Thinking about it is making my mouth water all over again. *drool*   The seared tuna salad is delicious too. Unlike the other salad entrees that come in ridiculously huge portions, the portion size for this particular salad is kinda small. But it's perfectly seared, with a peppery crust and a nice rare center. Mmmmmm. Another dish I adore? HIBACHI STEAK!!!! Ahhhhh! For all you sweet-savory-salty people out there...this is an ABSOLUTE must. The steak is extremely tender and the mashed potatoes gives you the pleasant surprise of the occasional chunk of unmashed potato in it. Some people don't like that but...I dig it. Mango smoothie with a dash of raspberry puree gets me everytime. If you can't afford their pricey cocktails (like me) bring your own flask and spike it...yes I've done that before. Bite me. Lastly...I should probably mention I'm a huge bread kind of girl. I like their bread here---comes with complimentary mini loaves of the oat-wheat-brown bread and the sour dough. I'm a fan. Ask for the blue cheese dressing (it has chunks of blue cheese in it) on the side and the tabasco sauce...hellloooo dipping sauce! Fo fwee! Win! I've tried their cheesecakes before and nothing really pops out to me. I'm not really a ""cheesecake"" type of gal though...pass. Tiramisu is pretty hands down AWESOME. Although they can lighten up on all that whip cream.... Parking is easy shmeazy.

John E.,"Atlanta, GA",1070,642,7819,3.0,3/14/2016,"You can find this location of the Cheesecake Factory at 4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30346 towards the northeastern corner of Perimeter Mall (far right when facing the main entrance from Ashford Dunwoody Rd). Parking is easiest from the lot to the right in front of Dillards department store and walking across, unless you want to pay the valet but you'll still end up walking a bit so I'd advise you to forego that inconvenience. I have a feeling that most of you have had the experience of the Cheesecake Factory - the first built (and now closed and replaced by a different location) in Buckhead at one time was the highest-grossing restaurant in the US. I believe this location was the second or third built in Atlanta and it's a really fantastic location. The interior has a fantasy array of Byzantine columns, wonderful fantasy-like wall sconces and very feminine fresco-like murals on a warm tan stucco adorning the ceilings - quite nice and it will make you feel a bit like you've entered a Disney theme park restaurant, however much like said-park the experience hardly meets the promise. I've worked in this area of Dunwoody for 15 or so years off-and-on so I've had many occasion to eat at this Cheesecake Factory. It's not a bad place to meet for special occasions as they can accommodate large parties - for my most recent visit I met with many coworkers for a bittersweet occasion - a member of our team was leaving for another work opportunity. When you are seated you'll be presented with a booklet of many, many items and now I'll voice my biggest gripe. The menu is much too large - I mean it's so big that there's advertising on some of the pages - is it a menu, or a catalog? I really don't see how any restaurant can offer so many dishes and hope to do all of them well. The last thing I want to see is a binder full of pages - where do you start? What's good? What's not? Too many choices.  The food here, and I've tried dozens of items, is passable - no real standouts from the many appetizer or entree sections. I honestly can't recommend any one item as something that's your missing or something you can't get elsewhere and I think this is where the restaurant's identity takes a hit. You're sitting in this fantastic setting yet with one exception, the food is pretty humdrum. We'll get to that exception shortly. I do like the basket of bread that they bring out - something about that wheat bread I really like. But then again, don't come here for the bread. When I think about the food here it reminds me a bit of TGI Fridays. Not that they are all that similar, but the food is very formulaic which is both a good and bad thing. It's good in that there's usually some semblance of food balance - starch to fat to acid ratios are good. It's bad in that the combinations are a bit tired - not much magic here. For mall food it's good and certainly better than the food court - of course you're paying more for it as well. Back to the Fridays comparison - I think the food here is better than Friday's as it's less snacky and more of a meal. Satisfying but not awesome. The exception of course are the desserts. I am not a big fan of cheesecake - it tends to sit very heavy with me, but I'll concede that the cheesecakes here are exceptional. I also like the Sunday and the ice cream in general. And maybe that's the point - I mean it is called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" so perhaps everything leading up to the dessert is just the build up to the big finish? But if so, why the phone-book menu? My final point is about the service. I find it very hit-or-miss. I've received both exceptional service and horrible service and it doesn't seem to matter what size the party is - sometimes the service is amazing on a group of 20 and terrible on just two. No rhyme or reason for it. I've had so many orders get screwed up here and it's really unclear if it was the server or the kitchen. I've had tables where everything showed up together except one lost plate and it took 20 minutes for it to appear with everyone either finished or sitting in front of cold plates, to wrong items showing up, to meals with food restrictive (bacon) items showing up with extra (bacon), etc. When service is good the server is usually very attentive and fixes any mistakes quickly. When service is bad you can't find the server and the attitude is really crappy. Like I said, hit-or-miss. So what's my final overall opinion? I think The Cheesecake Factory is exceptional for their desserts. The appetizer and entrees are mediocre but palatable and certainly better than mall food. The service hit-or-miss. Would I eat there again? Sure as it's close and useful for certain situations. Do I find myself wanting to go here? No. On a scale of 1-5, it's a fairly solid 3 due to the desserts.

Joshua C.,"Hiram, GA",2,44,61,3.0,5/6/2017,"As soon I walked in the front desk attendants had a horrible attitude. None of them smiled or even looked up when talking to me. The only thing that saved this visit was the server I had. He was beyond friendly and had great customer service. Maybe, they should take notes of his attitude and apply it to the first thing people have to go too. The food was nothing special that's why I rate this at a 3.

Cherparadise B.,"Marietta, GA",57,8,,2.0,6/26/2016,"Me and my gf visited about 2 weeks ago--and we won't be back!  We usually visited every now and then , but we will just go to the one in Buckhead for now on. We went in to get a to -go order of Shepard's Pie and two slices of cheesecake (no issue with the cake or course). Tony (the manager)  was on the phone while we stood in front of him for at least 3-4 minutes without acknowledging us,  then hung up before even whispering anything to us ; hold on,  hand gesture signaling one moment; Nothing! ..  Fast forward to 20 mintues later when we get home . We open it up and start chowing down,  or attempting to do so.. I notice that all the insides of the meat were pink af! Disgusting!  So.. We called back to the store to inform the manager Tony (guy). He asked ""what do you want me to do? "" in a tone that didnt sit well with us. umm... Fix the issue!!  We asked for the money back and drove back to get our $$$ back.  Just for him to not come out,  he sent another manager out to speak to us.  Then he came around the corner so fast and just sat the money on the counter so quick,  didn't say anything.  Just a half a second to put it down and a half a second to walk away.  That was bullshit! No apology,  no anything.   We won't be back!!

Was seated right away but our waitress took a while to come to our table, when she finally came she asked what we would like to have to drink. I ordered a mojito and a water and lemons, my mother ordered a water with SEVERAL LEMONS, my sister ordered the same. She came back with our water and about 5 thinly sliced lemons.  Then asked us if we wanted to order any appetizers which I did, I ordered the buffalo blast and she brought us some bread.  Ok here is where it gets a little rough.....she brought the appetizer and asked if we were ready to order. I ordered the Greek salad and my sister was trying to figure out what she had the last time she was there, asked the waitress some questions about the entree and after about 3 mins she placed her order. My mother still had not decided what she wanted so we told the waitress to just put our order in and give my mother a little time. The waitress did not say anything and turned away with an attitude like we bothered her by not being able to place our whole order.  .....ok O_o The waitress comes back in about 10 mins and ask my mother if she was ready and my mother told her that she was ok and would just be full off of the appetizer and bread. Note; my mother is a really fit chick that doesn't really like to eat after 9pm.  So the waitress then tells us she is going to put me and my sisters order in..... What?!  We thought she had done that already when she took our order the first time.  And way after that we sat there for a good 40 mins watching other people that arrived after U.S. Get their food. Our waitress not one time came to check on us or tell us that our food would be coming shortly. So after I seen her walk by U.S. A few times I politely asked her ""ma'am can tell us when our food would be coming""? She said she would go check on it. Please tell me why she came back by our table and totally ignored us? Didn't say your food is taking a little long, didn't say anything! Just walked right by us. I decided to go in and speak with a manager and I told him what happened, he was very nice and asked if we still wanted our food, my mother comes out and I told him to just give us the check for our table because we had waited too long already. He offered to pay for my drink and appetizer and we left. I Looooove The Cheesecake Factory and this will not stop me from going back, I just hope the young lady that served us poorly gets it together.

At this point we have been waiting for 30 minutes and a server finally comes by to tell us that he will be with us in a few minutes. About ten minutes go by he finally makes an appearance to tell us that he's going to get us menus and silverware. We have now been here for over 40 minutes and we still don't have menus! We decided to leave. I can understand if the restaurant was understaffed, but a quick glance around the restaurant you can clearly see servers standing around not doing anything.   There's absolutely no management presence.  No restauranteur would turn down sales by going on a false wait.  Management really needs to open their eyes and be guest focused.

Today's experience was one of the best, but I have to remember cheesecake factory is a chain. Now if you're rating just the cheesecake - 5 stars!!! yum! Best cheesecake. If you're rating the service -- today I would give 5 stars also. I have had bad experiences at this location in the past though. Some servers have given attitude when I am not buying 3-course meals and just an appetizer and dessert. The food depends on what I have gotten. It's usually ok, but I always have to remember that this place receives awards for how much sodium is in their food and highest caloric content of chains. I guess it's different to go to a nice restaurant and not know how many calories you're ingesting and to go to a place where their calories are published online :P. But in all seriousness, it's a great place for birthdays, family dinners, celebrations, catch-ups. It's easy to talk. There's music, but its not too loud. They have strong drinks and HUGE portions, and there is a lot of variety in their items! I've had their chicken marsala, peanut butter chicken (forgot name, but similar), one of their fried tuna sushi appetizers (Best i've ever had), and a couple of other things in the past. =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=80

I am very picky about the way salmon is cooked, but my miso salmon was cooked to perfection. It was served with about 8 snow peas, rice and a sauce.  I'm pretty sure that it was the healthiest thing on the menu.  The salads are not healthy.  One person in our party ordered a chicken salad.  It was huge and included fried onion rings and tons of cheese.  My elderly mother and her friend had the appetizer chicken fingers with potatoes and they loved them.  Their dishes were so huge that they had leftovers. I have two problems with this restaurant.  First, the dishes are so huge that they are unappetizing to me.

We waited an hour for a table when we were told it would be 20 minutes.  Ok that happens but when you have 2 children that's a big deal.

Jessica D.,"Atlanta, GA",322,445,227,3.0,1/30/2013,"Came here again last night for a birthday dinner. Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations, so it was a bit difficult to be seated since half the party showed up almost an hour late (better late than never, though!). We were among the first to arrive and went ahead and gave them a head count of 15-20. It actually wasn't too long until the tables were ready, but in order to be seated, we had to have at least 8 people present. At the time, we didn't, so we made the executive decision to give up our table and wait until they could get enough seating again later. It was a shame, because they actually held our table for about 40 minutes. If only people would just show up on time. The staff was extremely understanding, accommodating and kept us informed throughout the duration of our wait. 5-star service right there, folks. Fast forward an hour later, and a few moments after the final guests arrived, our new seating arrangement was ready for us. Here's the rundown: Service: Our two waiters were friendly and came by often enough for refills on everything but water, for some reason. Overall, not bad. Drinks: Frozen drinks were good; I'd recommend the Georgia Peach. Mixed drinks ($10) were okay but they were mostly ice and not enough of the drink itself. Just request for a little bit of ice and you'll be good to go. One buddy of mine ordered his usual Crown on the rocks ($12) and received some sort of mixed Crown concoction. The color was VERY off and it tasted extremely light. Skip on getting anything on the rocks, because they seem to cheat you of your spirits. Food: For the bigger foodies, we thought the dishes were very.. mediocre / subpar. For those who don't get out nearly as often, they thought it was great! Food portions were giant (that's their signature thing) except for the ""combination"" plates. So, keep that in mind when you order.. whether you have a big appetite or not. I got their crowd pleasing Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (according to the menu) but I found it to be very bland and the shrimp was overcooked and tough. If you come here, I'd suggest sticking to ordering small plates / appetizers and desserts only. I can't remember a time when I thought any entree was bomb[dot]com. For small plates / appetizers, I recommend: 1. Vietnamese Tacos. It's not authentic, and it's pretty much a glorified, Americanized version of a banh mi. It was interesting, but pretty darn delicious nonetheless. 2. Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip. You can never go wrong with any sort of cheese dip to start off your dinner! 3. Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. D and I got these on a whim when we were here before and it's probably my most favorite thing off their entire menu! However, much to my disappointment, it wasn't there or I overlooked it, in search of it ten times over. For desserts, I recommend: 1. Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. There are layers of red velvet cake and cheesecake, combined to create this piece of heaven. It was sweet, but not overly sweet. Simply put: it was perfect! 2. OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake. This one is new, and an amped up version of their OREO cheesecake they offered before. 3. Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel. I thought getting something with fruit in it would make me feel less guilty about ordering a dessert. Nope! This one is actually the sweetest tasting of the three I suggested. Surprising, huh? There is no free dessert for birthdays (darn!) but they do write a pretty message on your plate and come by to sing happy birthday. There were a LOT of birthdays celebrated yesterday. We heard the staff sing 3-4 times before it was finally our turn.

Adam R.,"Atlanta, GA",52,189,17,2.0,9/26/2009,"It has been awhile since I have been to the Cheesecake Factory, and with good reason. I have been writing mostly positive reviews lately and I took some time to think of some places that I could write negatively about. Cheesecake Factory fits well into this category. The only times I really came here were with my family, mostly when I was in high school. My sister loves this place, mainly for the desserts. She always wanted to go here for her birthday, and I, being the good brother, indulged her. The wait is always bad. I always had a hard time understanding why people come here, and wait over an hour on weekends to come here. As I got older, I would meet my parents and sister here usually at least thirty minutes to an hour after they would say to meet because I am not a patient person when it comes to waiting. After the long wait, I found the food very mediocre. I am doing this from the memories of years ago, but I usually would order the burger. I remember it to be always overcooked. I am a big fan of the pink center (giggity?) and they just ALWAYS overcooked my burger. Now granted the name of the restaurant is not ""The Burger Factory,"" but I have never wanted dessert from this place, probably because I do not like cheesecake. Though I cannot tolerate lactose well, even growing up when my parents never believed that I had such a problem, I never liked cheesecake. I have come here with friends for a party or two as well for dessert, and I usually have a drink and that is it. I have no interest in purchasing their overpriced desserts. This place is just way overpriced and it thinks it is better than it is like many places. I really cannot think of anything that is reasonably priced here except maybe the water. My sister says the cheesecake is good so I trust her on that one, but they try to sell themselves as a full service restaurant. In fact, their website's motto is now ""something for everyone.""

The service here absolutely astounded me.  I ordered up some fried cheese and farfalle with chicken and garlic, and both arrived in under 10 minutes, while there was still a huge line of people who hadn't even made it in the door for a table yet.  The pasta and appetizer were standard TCF fare: huge portions, good quality, and the exact same recipes as the one back in Boston that I'm used to.  I finished off the meal with a hot coffee, and was soon sent on my way with a wave and a ""Have a good night, darling!"" from the bartender.  Now I'm happy, stuffed, and just a little caffeinated, exactly how every meal should end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=280

Its always super busy, don't even try to go on a holiday without reservations. The menu has more options than almost any other place i've ever been. With all that, i still like this place for some reason but i really can only go once or twice a year. There food is good for a giant chain like Cheesecake. I really like the Steak Dianne and the seared tuna salad. The steak is delicious and the sauce is awesome, it usually comes with potatos and something i can't remember and its always too much food. I like the Seared tuna salad when i go for lunch. The tuna is perfect and never over done and the dressing on the salad is great, its a really nice light lunch. When i feeling particularly gluttonous i like the meatloaf, its way too much food and could really feed a family of four but its great. Of course the cheesecake is great so i'm really not going to go into it all that much. I love it, in fact, i had some for breakfast just this morning. that should say how good it is. The reason i give four stars and not five is because the service can be dreadfully slow and there is a wait all the time, no matter what time of day you go. and as i said before, if you don't have a reservation, weekends and holidays are out of the question, no one wants to wait 2 hours in this madhouse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=280

This is problematic because it appeared it was contaminated with wheat flour noodles. I actually ended up getting pretty sick from it, as I have an allergy... Sure they have a disclaimer for no gfree kitchen, but I don't understand how other noodles ended up in my pasta. My suspicion is they cook noodles together. That was a big negative to me!

I am so happy they introduces the Dulce de Leches cheesecake a few years ago - it's my absolute fav and you must try this is you like caramel. The Cheesecake Factory is a step up from your standard casual dining chains so don't come here expecting a full out gourmet experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=280

John M.,"Plympton, MA",14,100,2,4.0,11/29/2011,"Hey it's the Cheesecake Factory, if you've been to one, you've been to them all. As far as chains go, it's pretty good. I frequent this one in Atlanta when I travel here on business and I like it. The bartender where I dine does a great job, he's very attentive and friendly. As far as the food, they do it the same as the others I have been to. I'm a creature of habit and I have had an ongoing love affair with the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo for many years now. When I dined here recently I had it yet again and as usual it didn't fail to please my taste buds. It's a perfect combination of spicy, salty and Cajun. For an app this time I tried the fried calamari. It was nicely done, very light and crispy, but the real star of this dish was the side dipping sauce which is a garlic based mayo. I could put this stuff on anything and love it. For dessert, I had a piece of the Reese's Peanut butter Cup Cheesecake. Awesome, nothing more to say about it. After that I rolled myself out of the place... I ate way too much, but left with no regrets whatsoever.

Service:  Always spot on, service has always been fast and the staff have always been nice, absolutely not even one complaint here.

I had the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders and a Greek Salad appetizers. The Greek salad appetizer has no lettuce, so it's VERY DENSE. It was a lot of veggies, but I wouldn't try it again. The sliders were well-prepared, but a bit bland. The tenders would be better sans buns. There were also too many sliders for one person, but I should have expected that!

Gary T.,"San Antonio, TX",50,361,74,4.0,3/28/2011,"I had been wanting some cheesecake after eating some from their Alpharetta location a few weeks ago and we decided to just go ahead and make a whole meal of it. We decided to go to this location since it was near the Perimeter Mall and I knew we would need to walk some of this off after eating here. As you may expect, this place was pretty packed on a Saturday afternoon although we were seated very quickly, we waited less than five minutes. The biggest thing that stands out to me about this place was the portion sizes...WOW!!. You definitely get your money's worth here. I got chicken and biscuits for my entrée and I think it was $13 or $15 dollars and I definitely got a commensurate amount of food. My plate consisted of a few chicken breasts and 3 or 4 biscuits sliced in half with some country gravy, peas, carrots, and mushrooms smothering all of it. My wife got the pasta carbonara and I managed to get a bite of it and that was pretty good also although I can't tell you much about it since I was to engrossed with my food. I was looking at what some other people were eating next to us (salads) and those were huge as well. I was surprised that I was able to get all of mine down....all I had to do was starve myself all day before I went in here,LOL. We bought some cheesecake for dessert although we got it to go since we could barely move under our own power after eating this stuff. I got the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake and the wife got the Tiramisu cheesecake. The portion size on both of these were very generous also although I didn't eat mine until the next day. I managed to sneak a little of the wife's Tiramisu cheesecake that was really good also. I could see us coming back to this place over and over again just to work our way through all of the different cheesecakes that they have. The guy that served us was pretty cool and was always checking with us to make sure everything was ok. We had some questions about the restaurant and he seemed very knowledgeable about everything that was going on. Very good experience overall and we'll be going back to this particular location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=260

Amrita R.,"Saint Louis, MO",293,359,161,3.0,10/30/2009,"Cheesecake Factory isn't my first choice for a meal. It's rather overpriced and the food isn't that great. Not to mention, the menu is a bit overwhelming and it's hit or miss. That being said, I have managed to find a few gems on the menu that never fail me. I only go about once every few months if I am really out of ideas for dinners with friends, or taking a picky eater for a meal.  I just have to be prepared to consume many unhealthy calories. The avocado eggrolls are to die for. It's weird how some things on the menu can be unbelieveably bland and others can be so flavorful your mouth waters thinking about it.. odd. The eggrolls are totally worth going for actually, or just splitting with a friend as a snack. My favorite dish on the menu is the mahi mahi mediterranean... I find mahi mahi rather dry and it's my least favorite fish but the flavors added make up for it. The mahi mahi is served on top of delicious mashed potatoes and garlic and onions, with pesto and surrounded by diced tomatoes in a tasty sauce. However, nothing here is really worth the price; the fish costs $19.95; although the portion size does satisfy me for nearly 3 meals... I wouldn't choose to come here very often but if I must, I stick with these tried and true favorites. Oh yes, and the strawberry lemonade is always made with perfection as well, usually with sugar around the rim for my sweet tooth.

Alaina F.,"Decatur, GA",31,67,60,4.0,3/18/2011,"After a day of shopping at the mall, my husband, mother-in-law and I decided to eat here. After barely squeezing in the door due to the packed foyer of the place, we gave our name and the hostess said the wait was 30 minutes! At this point I'm starving and 6 months pregnant, so you can imagine my mood. Luckily we grabbed a few menus while standing for an abnormal amount of time, and I got the idea of what I wanted to eat. Then I got tired and a bit dizzy, one of the waitresses was kind enough to bring me a chair to sit in. After a couple minutes in the chair, we were called and seated in a roomy quiet booth. The place was hopping and people were everywhere, so I thought that the food must be damn good for a slew of people to want to wait 30 minutes before sitting. Our waitress was very friendly and accomadating, and brought the bread basket and drinks out fast. Bread was good, and it helped with my hunger.  I ordered the clubhouse salad which was one of the best (and most fattening) salads I've ever had. My husband ordered the hamburger with fries, which I tried and loved. The fries were crispy and perfect. My mother-in-law ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and corn succotash. I tried hers as well and it was very good. The succotash was very fresh and crisp.  Afterwards we ordered desserts, my husband and I split a piece of white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, which of course was very delicious. My mother-in-law got the lemoncello cream torte which was outstanding.  All of us enjoyed our meal tremendously and plan to return. Hopefully next time the wait wont be as long, and the place wont be packed with such rude people. The staff was great, felt bad for our waitress after seeing the check left by whoever sat in our booth before us--they left $7 tip on a $80 bill! How sickening. People should be punished for leaving hideously low tips, waiters have hard jobs, they only get paid less than $3 an hour! They depend on your tips people for their income!

Ariana M.,"Sandy Springs, GA",1,8,,1.0,1/5/2014,"Updated review: I wrote a review for this restaurant before but recently I have went in and was completely disappointed! The server was rushing me to order because I was the only one at the table who didn't know what to order so she attempted to help me out quickly and ended up recommending a pasta with bacon in it without letting me know that it has bacon in it. I do not eat pork and I violate my religion! When I asked the server if it had pork it in she did not know, which shows that they do not know about the food they are selling, not do they care if the customer will enjoy the meal. When I told her I couldn't eat pork she grabbed the plate the plate from me and said ""what do I do? Do I move it away from you?"" In a sarcastic tone as if there was something funny about this situation. I refused to pay for the meal and was told that I ate all of it and that can't be done. I'm sure that even people who do not like their meals at other restaurants the waiters and managers are pleased to satisfy them without even a question and offer them another meal. The manager at this Cheesecake Factory took this situation very lightly as if it was unimportant to me or him! He was very careless about my religion and not very sympathetic! This is was truly pissed me off, I know people make mistakes and when they are not able to own up to those mistakes and act careless as these people who would ever want to come back here? As I was waiting for my friends I overheard other workers who had no part in this situation speaking about me, laughing and mocking me to their coworkers. After hearing this, I asked the guy who was speaking of the situation for his name which he would not disclose, and neither would the manager!

You can expect to have food of a reasonable quality that is exactly the same every time you dine there.  Where CF really stands out, other than sheer convenience - I can walk there from work and live within 2 miles, is the service. I would highly recommend asking for Eric to be your server and if his section is full, it is worth the wait to have him.  He knows the menu so well, he can make great suggestions like with x dish you should request extra sauce or z dish goes better with this side than the one that comes with it. At a restaurant where food quality isn't that fantastic, this kind of information is invaluable. Plus he's just a really nice guy. Michael at the front desk is also fantastic and has made good suggestions for alternate servers when I've come in when Eric is off.  As for food, the roasted chicken is usually tasty and I like their waffle with strawberries for Sunday brunch. The vanilla bean cheesecake is delicious, as is the sundae because they make their own hot fudge and caramel sauce, which put their desserts on a much higher level than most chains that get sauces from Sysco and whipped cream from a can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=300

Michael V.,"Atlanta, GA",254,13,,2.0,4/5/2009,"I attended the Cheesecake Factory last weekend for the first time, mainly because I was given a gift card for Christmas and finally got around to cashing it in.  We had to wait for about 45 minutes, which I wasn't worried about at the time, but once the food came I was a little upset I had waited so long.  Now, admittedly at this point in my life I should know better than to order a steak at a chain restaurant and expect the world, but I had a big gift card so I figured what the hell.  And any chain establishment that's willing to charge $33 for a filet mignon had better mean business.  Well, suffice it to say the Cheesecake Factory does not mean business when it comes to the steaks.  The meat was just okay tasting.  Clearly not prime beef or anything close.  I guess I equated it to when you pay $33 for a steak at Ruth's Chris and the thing melts in your mouth and it's totally worth it.  Any establishment that can make meat melt is a-ok in my book, but there is no meat melting at the Cheesecake Factory people.  Let it be known.  The whole thing just tasted like a halfway decent piece of meat drenched in Worstershire sauce and a few spices.  Also, the fries I got were so bland and clearly frozen and that just sucks.  I mean, at this point if you're not doing fresh cut fries in your restaurant, I just do not understand what you are thinking.  They are such a crowd pleaser and not that difficult to make, but I digress.  I did not actually have the cheesecake, which was probably a mistake, but I was too full of mediocre steak at that point and was just ready to go home.  Highlight of the meal was the service, which was excellent.  Our waiter was very charming and was on top of our every need.  Also, the fried calamari appetizer was quite good.  Not chewy and overcooked like you get in most bigger chain joints.  I'm not saying I wouldn't go back, I'm just saying I won't order the steak again, and I suppose I thought they should be publicly spited for charging so much for such an affront to the steak community.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=340
soomy s.,"Cumming, GA",39,34,,3.0,11/30/2008,"My friends and I usually choose the Perimeter area to grub and gab cause it's a good middle point for everyone.  We came here cause the portions are huge, big selection of items and generally speaking - cause it's a chain- we don't need to worry too much about variation in taste.  Thus, we're able to focus on the main attraction - us, not the food.  I know, I know, yelpers are probably thinking - the whole point of writing a review is to write about the food.  And that is true, just not 100% of the time.  So, these are the usual suspects that we feast on - that pretty much is a guarantee that you will leave satisfied.  The key to eating at this eatery - is to eat chinese family style.  That way you can taste a bit of everything and not get bored of the dish in front of you.  So...for the four of us, we usually end up getting 3 dishes and split everything.  We got the Chinese Chicken Salad (dinner portion), the Thai Chicken Pasta (dinner portion) and the The combo Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane.  These are pretty safe bets when you dine there.  Just don't make the mistake of expecting the quality of the steak to match Stony River in Duluth, or the Thai Chicken Pasta to be able to compete with your favorite Thai restaurant..just don't do that and come with the mindset  you are there to catch up with friends and  you'll leave pretty happy.  Oh, also can't leave w/o a cheesecake - they're pretty damn good - even better sharing with friends.  Also, have to say they make excellent bloody mary's...don't even need the shot of vodka.  cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=340
Brandi R.,"Atlanta, GA",35,4,,4.0,4/21/2010,"My first time going to this Cheesecake Factory was on April 3, 2010.  Overall, I enjoyed my experience.  My friend and I went at around 8 on a Saturday night and I was really nervous because I thought we would have a super long wait. However, once we gave the host our name, we were seated within a couple of minutes.  I was really happy and shocked. I'm guessing the reason we didn't have to wait is because there were only 2 of us.    Our waiter was named Gary and he was really good.  To start, my friend and I both ordered from the Small Plate section of the menu.  I got the mini-crab cakes and my friend got the pizette(which is described as a small pizza) and her topping was sausage.  My mini-crab cakes were delicious!  They were basically crab cake balls and they give you about 7 and there was way more meat than filler, which is what I look for in a crab cake.  My friend's pizza was also good and for it to be on the small plate section of the menu, it was a good size.   For my main course, I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp that is served with rice, black beans, and plantains.  The shrimp are small, but they give you a lot.  Honestly, the shrimp were good, but I have no intention to order them again.  My friend had the steak diane and chicken combination plate. She said the chicken was okay, but the steak was really good.     I'm not a big cheesecake fan, but I figured I couldn't go to the Cheesecake Factory without having cheesecake, so I order the red velvet cheesecake.  It was really good and I would order it again!  I forgot which cheesecake my friend ordered.     So overall, I enjoyed my experience here.  We were promptly seated, the waiter was really nice, our food came in a decent amount of time, and the food was good.  I would definitely come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=340

Amanda S.,"Cumming, GA",5,109,14,3.0,2/1/2008,"Came here today for lunch with a friend.  I had only been to a Cheesecake Factory twice previously, and never at this location. We were told there'd be a 15 minute wait to be seated, but we were seated within 5 minutes.  Impressive!  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful in choosing what to order.  (And if you've never seen CF's menu, you WILL need help--it's the longest menu I've ever seen!  And there are no pictures of the dishes, just ads on the back of every page.  Rather tacky for an otherwise upscale chain.) We had our food promptly, and our waitress was good about keeping our drinks refilled.  Unfortunately, we didn't have time to order cheesecake because my friend had somewhere to be, and without cheesecake the experience was sorely lacking.  Word to the wise: don't go a restaurant named after a dessert if you won't have time to order said dessert. If I were to give the chain's bigwigs a piece of advice, it would be to shorten the menu and specialize in just one type of entree.  Specializing in just one type of dessert seems to have worked so far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-atlanta-2?start=320

I can't stand that. The broccoli cheese soup was Nasty... I love their passion fruit Iced Tea. My other half had a BLT salad and a lunch pizza. He enjoyed it.

I've never had less than a half-hour wait when dining here. My husband and I usually just stop in for cheesecake. The food isn't bad, but it just isn't stellar, especially considering the price points. Also, the portions are huge so you can get away with splitting most dishes (especially when you're having dessert). We've also never gotten very good service at this location. Most of the waiters and waitresses are surly and have an apathetic attitude (although I'd imagine waiting tables here is very, very stressful considering the huge volume of customers flowing in the door at all times, so I can kind of understand why they aren't beaming with excitement). The only true complaint that I have is that if you get cheesecake to go, they will give you a very small slice that's probably 1/3 of the size that it would be if you ordered it in the restaurant. I know this happens regularly and I believe it's a company-wide occurrence because it's happened to other people I know and at other locations. Lame, Cheesecake Factory, lame!!
