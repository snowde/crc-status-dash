Paula P.,"Austin, TX",143,30,59,1.0,10/9/2017,"Tragic experience every time.  Only reason I end up here is for office birthday or going away lunches where the honoree has a total disregard for everybody's time.  Whether a party of two or twelve, expect to have your food come out about two hours after ordering it, this includes salad.  Also forget about drink refills, they don't exist at Cheesecake Factory, you'll just have to wait for ice to melt and sip on that slowly because you're not getting any more ice either.  People joining us for a little bit had to request food items to go because not everyone can sit and take a three hour lunch.  I keep hoping each time it is better and it's just not.  Stay away or if you must come for cheesecake, just pick it up and take it to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=20
Sara S.,"Austin, TX",2,28,10,1.0,12/18/2016,"Let's preface this with; there is a Five Guys in the same lot, I would recommend them over Cheesecake Factory any day. Upon walking in, you'll discover the decor is oddly fancy? There are Pharaoh heads painted above the hostess station, it's quite comical really. My initial thoughts: ""Wow, this is a bit cheesy and over the top."" Once we received the menu, it confirmed my over-the-top gut instinct. The menu is a ring bound book of way too many dishes.  So, we ended up trying lunch today, anyway. We ordered; the Avocado Egg Rolls, the ""lunch serving"" of Fettuccini Alfredo and a Chicken Parma sandwich. The avocado egg roll was greasy, no crunch at all. The sauce that came with it was grossly sweet. We had to send it back.  If you enjoy gummy fettuccine and super heavy Alfredo sauce, this is the place for you. I took a couple bites and was over it. The green peas I had added to it USUALLY breaks up a heavy dish like this, but even that couldn't save it. Also, the ""lunch serving"" of this dish is only about a dollar cheaper than the dinner serving. Wow, what a savings.  The Chicken Parm sandwich was more of a bread sandwich with a tiny piece of chicken. The breading on the chicken also slid off mid bite. Marinara was bland. My boyfriend had ordered a salad with this dish and they gave us his salad dressing about 15 minutes prior to receiving his meal (which was brought to us with French fries and no salad). In conclusion, this place should stick to what it's actually good at, and has made a name for itself with - Cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=20

Snobby, I know. Surprisingly though, I really enjoyed myself. We ordered the Thai Chicken wraps to split. It was really good! There were three sauces and they all tasted great.

Lamanda B.,"Cedar Park, TX",203,111,64,4.0,5/1/2017,"I haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory in years, but this was worth the trip. Their menu selection was amazing! Any type of food you could think of was on this menu. I loved the bread that they bring out. Our first batch of bread was perfect. Nice and soft. The batch after that was burnt. The waiter tried to bring out more bread in hopes of it being better, but they were all burnt. haha. It was okay. I started off with the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. I love Jamaican food, but I should have known better ordering it from anywhere other than a Jamaican spot. The presentation was perfect, but I was expecting my food to be spicy. It was so sweet and taste like pineapple. I decided to send it back and try something different. I probably should have got the gumbo, but I opted for the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. This was good, don't get me wrong, but it would have tasted better with rice or a bowtie pasta. I love that it still came with a little heat behind it because I love spicy food. Our waiter, Jason, was fantastic. He was so pleasant and helpful as struggled deciding on what to eat.

I enjoyed my Strawberry fruit smoothie and even got a brain freeze which proved to me how much I liked it.  I also ordered the chocolate mouse cheesecake and it is still chillin in my fridge and I'm about to go get it so I'm going to end this review now.  Go get you some cheesecake already.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=20

I haven't ever had bad service here but tonight was definitely the best I've had in a while, here and in a restaurant in general. Rob had the best timing I've seen in a server. Consistently moving through his section, he caught us anytime we needed something as soon as we needed it. I finished my drink and set it down, content to wait for another, and he was there to pick it up and refill it. The chicken pot stickers came out as soon as we were done with the bread and butter, there was hardly any wait between app and entree (that was because we already knew what we wanted, though), and our leftovers and new cheesecake order were promptly packed up and delivered.

Sarah M.,"New York, NY",238,227,1414,4.0,11/21/2015,"How to describe Cheesecake Factory... I always feel like I'm walking into Caesars palace in Vegas here. It's like an Olive Garden/Chili's/P.F. Chang's on steroids. But really good food, just a ridiculously massive menu with all types of food.   The first time I ever went to a Cheesecake Factory, I ate too much and didn't even have room for cheesecake. Major fail, I know.  I didn't make that mistake the 2nd time. Or maybe I did but I just forced myself to make room. You can't skip out on cheesecake! I've ordered the same thing all 3 times because I'm an unimaginative creature of habit. But hey at least I know what I like, right? I have tried different cheesecakes so hopefully I get a little credit there.  The last two times at the arboretum location we've had to ask for bread so if you're not in the know, ask for it bc the wheat is very tasty. I ate 6 pieces tonight. Whoops. I was hungry. And if you ask for extra you'll have extra to take home with your leftovers.  We got the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer tonight and they were very good. You should probably get them too.  I enjoy the Chicken Crusted Romano and I only get about a third in before I stop myself so I will have room cheesecake. I tried a friends luau salad and it's pretty good as well.  The quality is consistent here and there is something for everyone. Literally. Because they have one of everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=20

Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5,5.0,12/29/2016,"As is to be expected at any Cheesecake Factory, the food here is phenomenal. Portions are huge and everything is super tasty. One thing I'd definitely suggest doing if possible is coming on some off time, in between the lunch and dinner rush or something. Otherwise, the wait to be seated will be pretty long. If you do come in between the rushes, you can likely just walk in and be seated immediately. Sweet. Service is great. The cheesecakes are great as always. I'm personally a fan of the 30th anniversary cheesecake, it's the perfect combo of chocolate and regular cheesecake so it's not too chocolatey. The other chocolate ones are simply too much in my opinion (though if you're a chocolate addict they'll be right up your alley), but this one is a combination of chocolate cake and plain cheesecake, so for me it's perfect. So good. The vanilla bean cheesecake is also phenomenal. If something like this can taste amazing where you don't have any chocolate to overpower your taste buds, then the cheesecake has to be awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=20

We sat in the bar & he asked for two waters (I was elsewhere at the time).  She brought one.  He thought that was weird.  It was.  We ordered another water.  Tick tock...tick tock...  Then we ordered an appetizer and requested water again.  I wasn't really hungry for food food, but I will always eat crab rangoons; especially good ones.  These were above average for sure.  We had to ask for napkins & utensils. I also ordered a margarita (no salt) & water...again.  She brought the margarita with salt.  I sent it back.  No biggie - this gets screwed up at most places.  Still...no water.  At this point, I had really forgotten about the water bc I had booze. After we decided on our cheesecake, he mentioned I still had not received my water & I said ""yeah, that's weird"".  I do like water, even more so if I'm having a cocktail. So, I asked for water again & a refill for him (bc his had been empty for quite a while) AFTER we received our cheesecake.  This time, we got it.   Cheesecake was good, of course.  It never disappoints.  The service was not so great.  Our server was super sweet & training a new server.  We were really just there for dessert, so we didn't care, but the service quality was lacking.  I think we would have been pissed if this had happened when we were there for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=20

Sharon Y.,"Austin, TX",390,77,160,2.0,5/2/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is an appropriate place to go to for celebrations because the atmosphere is warm and it's easy to accommodate big parties.  As for the food, it's pretty much the same at any Cheesecake Factory you decide to go to. The plates are pretty large and the quality is average -- definitely not quality food, but it suffices. The pricing is consistent with your typical dinner Italian meal, so it's not bad especially since the portions here are generally quite large.  I don't usually go here when I'm craving Italian food, but Cheesecake Factory seems to be a trademark place for celebrations. I haven't set foot in one of the branches in a while, I was excited to visit this nostalgic restaurant. I usually consider Cheesecake Factory as a 3-star restaurant, but the location in Austin seems more disappointing because of their clumsy snd disorganized service. The wait time was said to be 15 minutes but we waited for over half an hour, our server forgot to bring bread out & shoved my burning hot entree plate into my hand when placing it on the table, and by the end of our meal, everyone's water cup in my party was empty because nobody came to refill it. The food took longer than usual to come out, and when our server came to hand us a slice of cheesecake, she moved too quickly and the whip cream fell off --to which she simply said ""oh well!"" and left.  Perhaps I came on an off day, but I didn't have high expectations when coming to this restaurant. So for every person in my party to constantly bring up how dissatisfied they felt during the dinner, I'm not too sure if I'm going to be coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=80

Finished off with the salted macadamia nut cheesecake only to be disappointed because half of the slice was caramel too sweet with a think layer of nuts (for $7.50)....should've stuck to the original flavor.

Rachel B.,"Round Rock, TX",24,53,379,2.0,2/20/2016,"My coworkers and I have stopped in multiple times for lunch and happy hour since we work next door (within walking distance). The food is good, the portions are large (keep that in mind when you look at prices) but the service is consistently terrible.  I can't tell if they've been understaffed (for two years?) or if people just aren't getting the proper training. Multiple times we've had to wait 15+ minutes to be greeted. Then, once we put in orders and the drinks are delivered, no one seems interested enough to stick around for us to order our food.  It's like pulling teeth. This past Friday was especially terrible. Once there were more tables seated outside it got better, but in the beginning it was like we were an inconvenience. After years of working in the restaurant industry I do understand the challenge of handling the single large party on the patio, but come on. You have a patio that people want to use, so figure out how to service the patio without making it so obvious that it's out of your way. Do you want our money or not? I don't like having to flag down other waiters to find out where our server is. Waiting 15 minutes to be greeted (when the servers are huddled up by the bar chatting, or looking out at our table like ""are you going to take it? I'm not."") and missing out on happy hour pricing because of if also isn't on my list of favorite things.  We all have a choice about where to have our next meal, where to celebrate the next birthday, where to take our next date. Not sure that Cheesecake Factory is the best choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=100

Ahma H.,"Sugar Land, TX",20,183,1372,4.0,1/1/2015,"Burned out. Tired. Day one of a vacation and a long drive from H town.  Hello Austin. And glad for two Christmas Gift Cards from the Cheesecake Factory to enjoy w my spouse.  We found this Cheesecake location on Yelp. I was a little concerned w the prior Yelp reviews. Hmm. They only make reservations for parties of 7 or more. Boo. And up until 5:30 pm. Boo again. Parking crazy. Boo. But when we walked in, wow, it's like a whole new place. We were seated immediately.  What?  Yelp reviews said otherwise.  Hey and it's Christmas week and a lobby with people.  And we got sat right away?! Impressive.  The Food ordering no problem and everything ordered tasted great despite some reviews. And, the coffee was right on. Being from Jersey, it's the first thing I order. Some habits are hard to break. The awkward note about the visit was nothing to do with the restaurant but everything to do with unscripted joy of a small child. And For people with kids, this comes with the territory....In the ladies bathroom was a small young child happily singing randomly song after song - a serenade - of her own Christmas Concert and occasionally matching the Christmas Santa Clause Has Come to town Muzak songs emanating out of the loo's ceiling speakers. I left the loo singing myself. Santa had come to town. So let's give Santa and the Cheesecake Factory 4 stars. And the kid 5 for making a joyful noise.

Jeannie S.,"Austin, TX",0,46,,1.0,7/28/2017,"Searched long and hard for somewhere fun with good food to take our bday girl turning the big 13. She was so excited for her big day and the thing she looked forward to the most was not being handed a kids menu!! Had good memories of this place from Seattle. So... we get there and are immediately faced with a snarky rude cold hostess who didn't even look up and glance when I let her know we were celebrating our daughters 13th. Made my daughter feel really special... yep. In fact no one standing lifeless at the hostess counter even looked at us or cracked a smile. She then takes us to our table without a hint of a friendly gesture, throws 2 kids menus at our 13 and 10 year old (these are designed for 12 and under so ya- no clue here ; what a lame hostess)... literally tosses a heap of utensils right in the middle of the table and walks off. She walks back to bring a few napkins or something of the sort and I told her to remove the kids menu and bring our 13yo bday girl a GROWN UP MENU. She rolls her eyes and huffs off, obviously cursing under her breath and delivered said menu to our poor daughter. Had I the energy or the want to add additional stress to our special celebration I would have involved the manager.  However I decided to stay focused on our waitress who seemed interested in turning things around. (Meanwhile getting drive by evil eye by psycho hostess...) so, I pulled her to the side to kindly let her know about our bday girl and that I had brought #1 and #3 candles for her dessert. She happily asked to place them in her pocket until the reveal. I'm thinking things will turn around. Fast forward past an average overpriced dinner that didn't blow our socks off, here comes the long awaited lit cheesecake and cameras rolling as the bday song starts.... and we are totally let down as we noticed the #1 candle is a little stub completely broke off .. yes 1/4 of a #1 they had the nerve to stick into the cake sitting about an inch out of the cake looking totally stupid and the #3 fully intact which looked even more stupid. Then they act as if they don't notice!!  We are all staring at this stupid looking candle wondering what the heck happened! Ya think maybe someone could have had the decency or brains to bring this to my attention and just notify us that they could use other replacement candles (which yes I called ahead and made sure they do have basic candles for such events). So daughter leaves to the bathroom and I just had to ask the waitress what happened.   She looks embarrassed and puzzled in how to cover her tracks and proceeds to share with us about how it was in her pocket then got moved to a drawer than got moved to kitchen and something must've happened... ya just admit that someone broke it, apologize and let's get on with this lame horrible disaster of a night would ya??!!! OMG- NEVER GOING BACK. Just horrendous service.  Whoever you are managing this place and was there on the night of 7/26/17 at 5:45 PM, fire the hostess who would rather be smoking crack in the alley then graciously  serving customers and turning them into repeat customers. You know which one I'm talking about.

I'm finally writing this review, in part to remind myself not to make the mistake of returning again.   Extremely slow service (waiting over an hour for a simple order for 2 people), incorrect order fulfillments, and unresponsive corrections to the orders are all routine here.  In fact, I can only remember one time that I dined here uneventfully.  I am honestly not a picky person and rarely complain, so I can only imagine how more discriminating guests respond to their experiences which I doubt are any better than mine have been.  The take-out ordering has also been problematic nearly every time I've used it.  I'm not sure how a chain restaurant of this size can continue to operate with such poor performance.  I have to assume it's due to the proximity to a large hotel which must bring in unsuspecting visitors who don't realize the consistency of the terrible service, poor management, and overall poor experiences at this location.  I hate writing bad reviews, but since I've had plenty of bad experiences here, all of which cumulatively reflect a one-star rating, I feel obliged to share my opinion of this establishment to further the accuracy of Yelp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=100

TCF has an overwhelming variety of sandwiches, salads, entrees and desserts. Narrowing down your choices can be a task in and of itself so consider looking at the menu on-line ahead of time. As you order, remember my first observation and consider sharing with a companion or plan on eating the leftovers for lunch.

Ven S.,"Austin, TX",2,24,32,1.0,2/7/2016,"My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory quite regularly. Between taking visiting family and friends there or just going for dinner, we were there once every 3 weeks at least. Most of our experiences thus far have been positive. Food and beverage is pretty tasty albeit quite mainstream to appeal to ""the masses."" The only complaint I ever had till tonight was the long wait on busy nights, and that is expected and never warrants a negative review. However, tonight was a different experience. We met two of our close friends for dinner there tonight, and took our 2 month old baby too. We got our apps, and beverages ordered with our server - Cassidy. I ordered a Pineapple Moscow Mule. The apps showed up and my drink came too. However, amidst being engrossed in conversation with our friends and sampling the appetizer, I didn't notice for a few sips that I had the wrong beverage. After more than half the drink was gone (not more than 3 sips with the amount of ice these drinks have), I noticed that my drink was extremely sweet and full of mint leaves, and did not taste of vodka at all. Tasted more like rum (mojito). I told our waitress that although my drink was delicious, it couldn't possibly be a mule (even with it being pineapple flavored) and if she could possibly check with the bartender about it. She returned saying that the bartender had made an error and made a pineapple mojito instead of the ordered pineapple Mule. She asked me if I would like to keep the same drink or have her make the correct drink. I requested for the correct beverage to be made. The correct drink arrived and it was admittedly quite delicious. We continued with our meal and got 4 entrees at our table as well. After hearty laughs and chatting, and boxing our left overs, we requested checks. When the check arrived, I noticed that our check had 2 Pineapple Moscow Mule's on it. (I just had the one). This is where it went down hill. I asked for the waitress and asked her if there was an error, since they had brought me the wrong beverage and I only had 1 of the Mule. She was being very nice and apologetic and told me she would have to call her manager since she was under 21 and couldn't tell the drink was incorrect when she served it (not sure that is a valid excuse either). Up walks the manager - CHARLIE MARTINDALE. This gentleman shouldn't be even washing dishes or busing dirty tables, let alone be in charge of managing anything with patrons. He walked up to the table and almost rudely said ""Is there a problem here?"" I explained to him that my beverage had been prepared incorrectly and that the waitress and bartender agreed that they had made the wrong drink and replaced it with the correct one, and that I somehow had been billed twice. This is where it gets simply unbelievable. He says ""But did you drink the first drink?"" I explained that I had taken a few sips of it since I was preoccupied before realizing it was wrong. He said ""You drank too much of that drink for me to be able to comp it."" I informed him that both, his waitress and his bartender had agreed to the error of preparing the incorrect drink. To this he snapped back to me ""You drank the drink, didn't you?"" He then said he would fix the price of one of the Mule's to that of a Mojito and that it would reduce my bill by 50 cents or so. I could not believable what I was hearing. The funny part is that it isn't even that $9 that the beverage cost that I was unhappy about. It is the way this manager of a higher-end chain handled such a petty issue with rudeness and talking down to a patron that really rubbed me the wrong way. At this point I told him that I no longer required his help and paid off the bill as is. Needless to say, there was no tip left on this bill. My wife and I will never go to this or any other Cheesecake Factory or Grand Lux Cafe (same ownership). Our friends who accompanied us tonight also left with a bitter taste in their mouth and will no longer frequent this establishment either. Cheesecake factory had provided us with a reasonable and tasty dining option thus far, and hired what seemed like good staff from all our experience till today. However, like it is said too often ""All it takes is one."" This one rotten apple was the manager - CHARLIE MARTINDALE. The waitress Cassidy was being extremely apologetic when I asked for her name and the manager's name. She said if it was up to her, she would have comped the drink since it was her error. She repeated that since she was newer and under 21, she didn't have the required authority to modify alcoholic beverage orders. We have returned home with a bitter taste in our mouths, and this review is what has resulted of it. Sorry Cheesecake Factory - you need to do a better job of training your managers in customer relationship management - at least this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=120

Xinjie H.,"Austin, TX",45,63,94,2.0,7/31/2015,"This use to my go to spot that I would rate 5 stars. I would come here at least 4 times a month with friends. However, it has been going downhill and I don't think I would be coming back here anymore. Maybe the new location but it has been so disappointing with this location.  Last month I came here, I ordered black peppered Jamaican shrimp. The rice was disgusting, it was so crunchy.... Obviously we all know rice isn't suppose to be dry and crunchy especially since this was one of my favorite entree. The shrimp was super small.... Not worth it. This month I came here for dinner and got my other favorite chipotle pasta. We didn't receive any bread from the start but that's fine. It's just bread. They forgot the chicken and realized that they gave me the wrong vegetarian dish instead of the normal dish. Which is okay. When I received the chipotle pasta, the size of it was smaller than lunch portion. It was like 10 bites max and 5 small pieces of chicken. The plate is big... Sure but not the dish itself. As a usual fan of chipotle pasta, I know what their size is suppose to be. I've been coming to this place for years now ordering the same entrees. And their quality, service, and quantity has gone done. The dishes that are small now and the food quality is not worth mentioning. The only that has increased is their price...

I arrived at 11a which was the promised pick up time and walked out at 11:40a causing my 11:30 meeting to be late. What I encountered when I was there was inefficient, untrained staff that need better skills. In addition one of the items on my receipt was left off so I had to get that added, then again when they charged me the wrong price for a lunch item which they rang up as a dinner item, then once again to get lemon wedges that they kept forgetting after asking numerous times (and forgot to put in my bag so I had to grab the container sitting in a separate area myself). Throw in the fact that she said ""do you need forks and napkins"" with my 10 meal order and it's almost comical.

How could anyone complain about service here?! It's hands down the best service we have had in the Austin area since we moved here. The avocado rolls were absolutely delicious. The guys loved the macaroni balls; they were not anything special for me. The fish tacos were okay. The batter is way to thick on the fish & a bit greasy. The carbonara was delicious.

I was a victim of discrimination, and I can tell you why. The the most law abiding Texans are License to Carry a handgun people. At the entrance, high and to the right, on a window at about seven to eight feet high (way above eye level, which I don't believe is legal anyway) I saw a TPC 30.06 and 30.07 sign, to keep LTC out. This of course only  tells criminals, that they have no one to fear, so if they want to, they can commit any violent crime they want. Since they break laws for a living, the sign is a joke to them. There was no armed security there either, which tells me Cheesecake management don't care about their employees, or customers and there families safety. This of course, leaves the Cheesecake Factory wide open for a lawsuit for not having adequate security and not allowing for customers or staff to protect themselves. Therefore I cannot recommend this restaurant, for it's dangerous and discriminatory practices. Take your business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=140

Lily W.,"San Diego, CA",190,222,112,4.0,2/14/2014,"Come here on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday because that's when our server Janelle works! She's awesome! Cheesecake Factory is one of those strangely elusive chain restaurants that holds a special place in my heart. I spent my teenage and college years in Michigan and surprisingly there is NO Cheesecake Factory anywhere in the state. Strange, because Troy, MI (my hometown) is like the king of all large chain restaurants. Regardless, because of this cruel twist of faith that withheld Cheesecake Factory from my taste buds, I was determined to try it one day. I ended up trying it on a trip to Chicago and well, I didn't know what to order and was instantly overwhelmed by the monstrous menu. I remember the meal being decent, but somehow it didn't live up to my hope and dreams. Fast forward to two years later when I moved to Houston. I mentioned to my boyfriend at the time that I wasn't sure if I liked Cheesecake Factory and he insisted we go that day. I believe I got the Shrimp Etouffee and actually liked it. He got the Chicken Madeira which blew my Etouffee out of the water. I was sold. Since then I've gone to a few Cheesecake factories in various cities around the US. This location happens to be the only location in Austin. I like that it's almost always open until 11PM which is great for late night desserts! Most of the servers are pretty good but some standout ones are Natasha (I believe she introduces herself as 'Tashi), Tanner, and of course, as mentioned in my tip, Janelle.  I still go for the Chicken Madeira, but I've tried a few other items on the menu and have to admit that the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Thai Lettuce wraps are pretty good too. I like the Upside-Down Pineapple Cheesecake and upon another Yelper's recommendation tried the Banana Creme Pie Cheesecake and they're my current favorites. Like I've mentioned in previous reviews, I like chain restaurants when I'm in doubt and looking for a halfway decent meal. They have standards.... that's got to count for something right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=140

Mostly for birthdays and other special events.  I have seen it decline through the years. I understand this was the second weekend of spring break so we expected a long wait especially with SXSW also going on but...when we arrived we were told it was it would be 40 minutes  but we actually waited for over an hour (64 min) to be exact.  The wait is not the restaurants fault. I get it but, if we were told it was an hour we would not have stayed.  And due to the cool snap, there was pretty much wall to wall people in the entrance. Standing...for 64 minutes.... We had a variety of entrees from a club sandwich to sesame ginger chicken, the chicken was spicier than expected. The rest of the food we ordered was fairly expensive and pretty ordinary.   The waitress and hostesses were working their tails off, the kitchen was backed up (understandably. With that many people).   I am giving it 3 stars because the avocado egg roles as an appetizer and of course the cheesecake was really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=140

David S.,"Ashaway, RI",47,83,6,3.0,6/7/2015,"The wait times are a bit long if you want a table.  However since this is a family restaurant, the bar usually has open seats and if you eat there, they will spread cloth napkins. The free bread is average to below average.  Not fresh, not sure if it's made on the premises.  It is a filler. Not sure what the exact name of the appetizer is, it is 2 Salmon wraps that were deep fried then cut diagnally to make ""4"" pieces served on a HUGE bowl filled with diced red lettuce.  Garnishment I understand but not really understanding this presentation. Since I was at the bar, service was immediate and my beer glass was never empty.  The bar staff is very responsive and friendly.  The people delivering the food are courteous and friendly as well. I had the Bang bang chicken and shrimp and overall it is okay.  Most of their dishes seem very original, some updated Asian fusion dishes. The cheesecake was the highlight of the meal, obviously.  The key lime cheesecake was great. Although they only have 2 $'s on the rating should be 3 $'s.  Total bill for 2 people with a share appetizer and 3 drinks each, seperate entrees, 2 orders of cheese cake came out to $115, not including tip. The appearance of the place reminds me of mediterranean architecture with a lot of curves, gold/gilded color bases.  It looks pleasant. This place looks very clean.  The staff cleans up well.  Room between seats/tables are about average.  You don't feel packed but due to the layout, conversations carry so if you're looking to having a serious conversation, you would have to sit next to each other.

We ordered cheesecake afterwards and that took 25 minutes. I tried to follow up with the server and then a manager and they really seemed dismissive.

For $67 I wanted to scream at this meal.   I got the endive salad to start.  Blegh. I took the waiter's suggestion and got the salmon special.  I don't normally order salmon, but I'm trying to eat more fish.  So away I go.  I get it and don't love it.  I chalk that up to, maybe I don't really love salmon.  As I take a few more bites I don't think that it's cooked all the way.  BUT, I don't cook salmon so what the hell do I know.  I become paranoid and quit eating it.  It also just had this bizarre taste, I can only liken it to plastic.  It also had some sort of coconut sauce that the rice was in and that was really sweet and just not good to me. BF got roasted chicken which came with some veggies and mashed potatoes.  I ate his carrots and enjoyed them.  The potatoes also just had this bizarre taste that I couldn't put my finger on, but it wasn't good. Still a little hungry, and thinking, well we are at the Cheesecake Factory, let's get cheesecake, we get two desserts to go (I'm ready to go home). We got the classic, cheesecake with strawberries, and a piece of Tiramisu.  The cheesecake was rather soft, and had more of a sour taste to it than I am accustomed to.  It was topped with fresh strawberries, but they were in some sort of gross jelly.  The Tiramisu was pretty good. The price is what killed me, for a meal that wasn't good we spent seventy bucks.

What they make that is good, is great, everything else seems like filler to be honest. When you have a menu that is that HUGE, its hard to be great at everything. . .and u know half or more cannot be fresh.  I ordered the tuna tartare the last 2 times I've been. Next time instead of an entrée I'm ordering 2 as my meal.  This last visit I ordered a margarita flat bread ...it was eh. . the tomatoes were cut to thick so that's all you tasted, tomato, and it still tasted raw to me, or undercooked.    The bf ordered the Navajo. no thanks, he said he'd never order that again. he said it was too big and difficult to eat. Next time he said he'd order chicken stuffed tortillas (basically quesadillas).  We shared the red velvet cheesecake. never disappoints, never gets old. THIS is what they make great, and they know it. why waste calories on food and alcohol when this is about all I've enjoyed from CF. Not the drinks, not the pasta (every dish I've gotten just wasn't good), not the salads (I love cobb salad but theirs is just lettuce it felt like).  And so to sum up, either or the tuna tartare, a pizza (the girl next to me had a pepperoni pizza that looked great. . .) or the cheesecake.  Another thing that surprises me is the amount of people that order their own slice of cheesecake, way too much food for you to finish (which they never do) next time order just one and share. . you'll appreciate each bite even more. . :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=140

Most days I can swear by this flavor but this time around I didn't even like the cheesecake. I don't know if it was an odd day or just me but I was really disappointed. An extra star for the bread- it was amazing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=180

Annie D.,"Austin, TX",3,18,,3.0,11/13/2014,"My husband really enjoys the cheesecake factory and he always drags me here. I've noticed a change lately, I thought I would post about. The first several times I went to this restaurant I was so impressed by their service that I told one of the servers, ""we never, ever get bad service when we come here."" He told us that the training for servers there was very stringent and they had extremely high standards for who they hired. I really thought it showed. But the last probably three or four times we've gone, we've had experiences that fall almost on the opposite end of the spectrum. It takes so long to get greeted by your server, get your drinks/bread, be asked for your order, etc. Then at the end of the meal, it's the norm to have your server ignore you, seemingly forget about you, and/or completely disappear. I can't stand going to restaurants where you have to wait forever for your check. It feels like they're holding me hostage long after I did what I came to do, which is eat food. Yes, I like sitting and visiting at a restaurant, but I would rather do it out of my own free will and not because the server forgot about me or doesn't care. It's really sad because it didn't used to be this way but something must have changed with their hiring process or training. Either that or they've gone the way of many other businesses and don't have enough people staffed at the right times. It bums me out too because I do think their food is almost always good and I really really really like cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=180
Ashley A.,"Austin, TX",245,6,5,1.0,7/20/2016,"Went here for a friends birthday, she had talked to a manager earlier in the day and he told her to show up early to get a table for a large party. They tried saying they wouldn't seat our party until the full party was there. It took 20 minutes just to receive our water we had requested and then another 10 minutes for our cocktails. We were there an hour before they took our food order and then another hour before our food came out. My boyfriends steak was well done when he ordered medium rare so everyone was finished eating by the time we got our food. Their solution was 6 free slices of cheesecake and taking off the steak. When the cheesecake came out, our table was still full of empty plates so I asked the waiter to please pre us the table and his response was 'I'll pre us when I have an empty hand' no clean plates or silverware or a clean table to eat our desert.

Tim Y.,"Washington, DC",1109,221,461,5.0,1/19/2014,"Let's just start by saying that I loathe The Cheesecake Factory.  It's where you go on really fancy date night in High School or in College because you don't know any better... and if you're choosing to go here over the plethora of unique and awesome restaurants in Austin, you bring great shame upon yourself and your entire family. I say that to say this:  I have to give it 5 stars based off of a singular experience I had there the other night.   I didn't choose to go... it was a friend's birthday and she wanted to go... In total, she suckered 8 people to go there on her birthday. The food was the usual oversized portions of junk, the cheesecake was cheesecake, the service is always spot on... But then THERE WAS A COCKROACH CRAWLING ON ONE OF OUR PARTY-GOER'S BACKS! She stood up and screamed... then half the table screamed... then her baby started crying.   We called the manager over who, after just 2-3 minutes of decent apology and no haggling... comped our entire meal... that's 8 people to the tune of about $200. She didn't have to do that, but she was extremely sympathetic and awesome.   So see, even though I only go to The Cheesecake Factory when I'm forced to be there, this experience says they know customer service. DISCLAIMER:  If you go and act like there's a bug on you to get free food after reading this, you're a loser.

Ryan B.,"Austin, TX",242,190,169,1.0,1/4/2014,"Shockingly bad customer service experience. Disappointing visit after visiting this location multiple times. The Cheesecake Factory has a great selection of cakes as you walk in. I've always ordered a slice or two on my way out. This night, however, featured some of the clumsiest and worst customer service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. It was a birthday dinner for a friend of ours. A cheesecake was purchased up front as we waited to be seated. The wait time was only a little over 30 minutes on a Friday for a large group. Not bad. That was the end of the good experience. The menu is overbearing, the servers have no idea what is available and what isn't available. You finally make a selection only to have the waiter come back ten minutes later and tell you there is no pizza dough. That is the most frustrating feeling when you are hungry. I tried to order a couple of margaritas while we waited. The waiter suggested I try some of the famous cocktails instead. He talked me into them, so we ordered two. Five minutes pass, no cocktails. Ten minutes... We ask him where the cocktails are? He looks up into the ceiling for a second as if he is in deep thought... Oh he forgot to key them into the system and they were never ordered. Wow what a disaster of a visit this is. Our food has already arrived, no drinks and a confused service attendant. We ended up declining to have the drinks ordered at this point. Why give them the money? We had mentioned at the beginning that it was someone's birthday at our table. The other tables around us got birthday songs and normal treatment. This waiter spaces, didn't say a word to our birthday patron and then managed to forget to bring out the cake twice. When he did finally bring out the cake, he kind of looked at us not saying a word.. then realized he had brought no plates or silverware for us to consume the cake with. As he reached over the cake to pickup our old plates, he almost made contact with the cake with his shirt several times. He then proceeded to bring out two boxes that didn't fit the cake. I've never seen someone so lost in space or on another planet in my life. Save yourself the trouble people.

He meant well that's all I'm gonna say. He took our alcohol drinks without carding us. I'm 24. I pulled out my ID he said that was fine. My friend asked for an unsweet tea that she didn't get until after the meal was brought because we asked a Different server that brought out our meal if she'd get us one.

I ordered something that  but modified it. He got 1 of the modifications right. He never touched the table again. I had to wave him down for a box. Again, for our check.

Taylor R.,"Cedar Park, TX",240,15,1,2.0,8/4/2017,"Came here for my husbands birthday with the family on Cheesecake Day. I called ahead to make a reservation and was informed they do not take reservations. We got there an hour early to put our names in then walked across the street for some drinks (the bar was packed here). We planned on being back in a little less than an hour but called them to see if they could call us when the table was close to ready to make our way back as sometimes the wait times aren't always accurate. The hostess seemed annoyed and said just come back in 20 min. We came back and 9 of us were squished into a round booth in a back corner. I looked up and noticed everyone was sweating. I asked the waiter if the AC could be turned down and he replied, ""the ac is broken, imagine how my days been"" and walked off. Our waiter came by and let us know that the cheesecake was taking about 30 min due to the high volume. Then the waiter just stood there and then asked what Cheesecake we wanted. I said ""oh I didn't realize we were ordering that right now"", and he said ""yeah that's why I told you it was taking 30 min"" even though this was before we even ordered our entrees. My cucumber mojito just tasted like soda water. The entrees were decent. The Cheesecake was so bland. It tasted like something I could defrost from a heb freezer.

Matt P.,"Austin, TX",35,88,46,2.0,4/17/2013,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory two times. The first, we had drinks and cheesecake to go. The second, we had drinks and apps. We sat at the bar both times. I had high expectations going both times due to all the hype Ive heard from friends and others. Both times we went, we had the same bartender, I believe Jackie is her name. She was attentive and fantastic both times we were there. Never a dry drink and quick with any requests we had. The cheesecake we had was ""Adams Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple"". Dont get me wrong, it was rich and very good, but when your namesake is such I expected life changing cheesecake, and thats not what I got. Our second trip we I wanted to try as many things as possible from the novel of a menu CF offers. We ordered small plates and apps that included the made to order guacamole, Parmesan Polenta Fries, Crispy Crab Bites, Dynamite Tempura Shrimp and Vietnamese Tacos. The guac was good and fresh, but I had to salt it 4 times before I felt like it was right. Guac is very simple, salt being one of the key ingredients. I thought it perplexing that there was little or none in ours, and at $10.95 I dont feel like a little salt is a lot to ask for. The parm polenta fries struck me as straight out of a frozen bag into a deep frier, nothing special here. The crispy crab bites had big chunks of crab in them which was nice, but they were slightly undercooked, pretty greasy and served with a side of what Im assuming was supposed to be tartar sauce. It was more like mayo with 4 peices of relish in it. The dynamite shrimp was a big let down. There was nothing dynamite about it. There was no heat anywhere in the dish and the flavors were pedestrian at best. The worst thing we had was the Vietnamese tacos. I had made it 3/4 of the way through the first one when I got to the part of the bun that was stale and hard as a rock. I didnt even attempt to eat the other two and asked to have it taken off the bill, which Jackie handled without hesitation. We took our leftovers to go, which promptly ended up in the trash as soon as we got home because I was not interested in eating any of it ever again. My model has always been to give a place two chances because anyone can have a bad day. The Cheesecake got their 2 out of me, and they will get no more unless it includes drinks at the bar only",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=240

If you happen to eat at this location and receive her as a server, consider yourself lucky. She was absolutely outstanding! Melyssa was extremely nice, cheerful, responsive, and attentive. Everything was prompt with her; additionally, her demeanor was very positive. The other staff at this location were also excellent and so courteous. The service Melyssa gave my friends I has been some of the best I have ever received. I ordered the SkinnyLicious Soft Tacos with shrimp. The meal is something I would definitely order again. The three tacos were perfectly filled with the right amount of shrimp and other toppings. Additionally, the vegetables that are served on the side are great. They had just the right amount of flavor I thought. Between the service and the food, this location has more than warranted give stars.  I also spoke on the phone to Charlie (I believe that's his name) who was a manager that night. The service and food was simply too outstanding to not thank someone in management.

Ryan H.,"Cedar Park, TX",6,169,6,2.0,5/2/2013,"There is nothing inherently wrong with this place besides maybe the prices. Its just underwhelming. The prices are very high for what you are eating (typical appetizer in the $8-10 range and meals about $15 all the way up to $30 for a ribeye). The amount of stuff on the menu is overwhelming and leads me to believe they are mostly prepared from frozen food. Which leads to my other observation that many of the dishes are very salty. Obviously the cheesecake is great. It's what gets people in the door, and rightfully so. But beyond that, its a place that is expensive and specializes in nothing. Its probably good for a group of picky eaters because the menu is so large its hard to find something thats not on there.

Anna S.,"Redwood City, CA",12,93,28,4.0,5/30/2013,"I'm a fan. Apparently some people here aren't. The service is great. As with all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants, the waiters/waitresses will wear white to show that they are hiding nothing. Any food stains can be easily seen I suppose, but here's the other catch. The lights are generally annoyingly dim, so even with a white uniform, I still wouldn't be able to see any food stains. Nevertheless, the servers are super friendly and make sure they get you what you want.  One of the complaints here is that the food is really expensive, but honestly I think it is a reasonable deal because Cheesecake Factory provides you with so much. If you can't afford it, then share the dish with one other person and split the check. If you're still hungry, you can munch on the complimentary bread and butter. And let's not forget to order dessert. The Cheesecake Factory makes so many different delicious, mouth-watering cheesecakes. I usually choose the fruity ones.

Big mistake! There were seven of us, but it didn't take long to seat us, so that was nice. Of course, it was only 4:30 in the afternoon, so it wasn't packed. We were seated at our table and given menus and then waited...and waited. Finally, we see the waiter and he asked for our drink requests. Once he brought the drinks out, he left...and we waited some more. He finally came back and we were able to order appetizers. He didn't ask us if we were ready to order the rest of the meal, he just left and we waited some more. We saw him a lot, at a table across from us, just chatting it up with those diners, but we had to stop him to give us more bread and refills and then finally order our dinner. He also forgot to put my co-worker's drink order in. By this time, we were pretty irritated, so I asked the hostess to have the manager stop by our table. This is where it gets inexcusable. About five minutes later, the manager stops by our table and asks us how we were enjoying everything. We told him how bad our service was and expected an apology or something to let us know he cared. He said he was going to check on our food and sure enough, it came right out, but we never saw the manager again. He never came back to check on us, to apologize, to rectify the situation, nothing. We are an office that works in customer service and this is totally unacceptable.

Being a princess through-and-through I made sure to leave him a $20 tip on a $18 bill to show that not every customer coming in for a quick desert is going to be a cheap-ass and tip poorly.

If you've been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know that it's overwhelming -- the faux fancy decor that reminds me of Vegas, the book-like menus (why are there ads in their menus? tacky!), the enormous portions. We just don't eat vast quantities of food, preferring quality to quantity. So, for lunch we split three ""small plates"": crab bites,  dynamite shrimp, kale salad.  Crab bites: surprisingly tasty, with real crab in evidence. Sauce: what was that, mayonnaise? Very little flavor and definitely did not enhance the crab cakes. Dynamite shrimp: tempura shrimp served with a ""dynamite"" sauce. Folks, what does ""dynamite"" indicate to you when you read it on a menu? Spicy, am I right? No spice here. Merely a different color of mayonnaise. Very little taste. Shrimp themselves were okay, but tempura batter absorbed a lot of grease (fried at too low a temperature?). Kale salad: disappointing. The apple had a floral overtone, and the creamy dressing overpowered the ingredients. Frankly, the kale salads at both Central Market and Whole Foods outshine this one by a long shot. He insisted on dessert, and ordered carrot cake. (I know -- it's the CHEESECAKE factory.) But the carrot cake was quite good. $7.50 a slice -- it should be good! It was large, but...

If their is an issue in the kitchen, the manager needs to be explaining this to people instead of just leaving to wait forever on their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=160

Sharon C.,"Austin, TX",10,68,1,1.0,11/4/2014,"Went for the first time last night and...it just wasn't good. At all. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip, which tasted like hot tuna salad. I don't know if the crab was off or it's just that awful a dish, but we each tried a couple spoonfuls of it and then ignored it in favor of the bread. My girlfriend got Evelyn's Pasta, which wasn't bad...in the middle. There was a huge ring of inedible pasta that had dried up from sitting under a heat lamp. I got the meatloaf. It was a different flavor than I was expecting, but okay. Then I noticed that the grilled onions in sauce (that was all over the meatloaf) had lots of inedible onion peel. So I decided to eat my sauteed spinach instead but it was so loaded down with pepper that I couldn't eat it. It wasn't ""spicy,"" it was as if the top had flown off a pepper shaker and accidentally dumped 5 tablespoons into it. We left and ended up at home eating PB&J two hours later.

My son ordered a slice of pie but it wasnt good and  milkshake that was just okay. Mi lil son ordered two pumpkin pie slices and they were delicious.

John R.,"Pocahontas, AR",316,319,596,2.0,7/19/2014,"I have a long and storied past with The Cheesecake Factory. I used to work right next door and ordered meals from them frequently. They gave me so much free bread. And the portions they offer? Legendary.  This particular visit was my first post-hospital-solid-foods-experiment. I kiiiiiiiiind of managed.  I ate two chicken strips and a few bites of succotash. A few things I noted: the bread came AFTER we ordered our meals, whereas it used to come pretty freely before. The noise isn't as loud anymore. I don't know if they've turned down the music or if I just came at the ""right time."" The service is more on point than I've ever seen it in terms of timeliness, but not in terms of consideration. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich. What pulled pork they had was not up to par and the manager came out to apologize. She asked if there was something else he wanted and also brought out his side order of sweet potato fries. I may be obnoxious (okay, fine, whatever, call me obnoxious) but when his re-order came out without a side, I thought that was a little tacky. You've inconvenienced a customer and your consolation is something that they're having to pay for already and you're not replacing it with anything or comping the bill at all? Call me a product of modern society, but there's something called ""going the extra mile"" and they certainly did not in this situation.  My cajun chicken strips were mildly spiced. I get that you're operating for the masses, but just call them chicken strips. There's nothing cajun about them, even if they are still appetizing. I get that they're in a location that's on the decline, but if they're giving up to this degree?

(and we weren't asked whether we would like to wait longer for a larger booth). Those small tables are NOT big enough for 2 people. THEY ARE A ONE PERSON TABLE. But lets be honest this isn't even the beginning. 2) Ordered the sliders and they came with ketchup on them. I don't know ANY nice sit down restaurant that ever put ketchup on its burgers. In my opinion it's basically a Mcdonald burger at the point. While it did say that it came with Ketchup on the menu, I just assumed it would come on the side like EVERY other single sit down restaurant. Lol. But I assumed wrong. Well then when I noticed there was ketchup on my sliders, I tried to get the waiter. He had disappeared completely. Well then when I finally tracked him down, he didn't want to let us send them back and get something else. He then suggested we order a kids slider plate. So I did and then the burgers came out and the buns felt like they had just been pulled out of the microwave - you know like those white castle burgers you heat up in the microwave. That's what they tired to served me. So on the 3rd round my food was finally right.....We thought that would the end of the terrible dinner... But no... 3) We get our check and review it and the waiter goes to run it. It comes back with a bill for like $20-30 more. He had ran our card on a higher bill.... Not sure if it was mistake or not....  Needless to say, we will NOT be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=160

Aimee L.,"Austin, TX",5,35,8,1.0,11/29/2010,"I really do think about more than hot tea, but come on folks, sometimes a business should just be ashamed of itself... So I went to Cheesecake Factory on Friday afternoon with my 8-year old for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up afer the Children's Museum. She is ga-ga for cheesecake, so where else? I was prepared to watch her indulge while I soothed my fractured nerves with a nice pot of Earl Grey, and then the waitress informed me they were out of hot tea. ""What!"" I joked (really, I was smiing). ""How can you be out of hot tea?"" She replies, straight-faced and emotionless, ""We're out of hot tea bags. Would you like hot water with lemon?"" Uh no, actually, I wouldn't. We ordered forgettable food and it was delivered with decent service-with-a-smile, but the occasion was ruined.  Running out of tea isn't a crime, but great businesses develop fanatically-loyal devotees through creative problem solving. If they were out of ketchup, what would they do? Run to HEB. If they were out of, gasp, coffee, what would they do? Place a frantic call to Sysco. But when they're out of hot tea, it's acceptable to simply inform the customer that they can't have the one thing they came in for? I think not.  We'll be cheesecaking at Chez Zee next time...

He was very understanding, said ""sure"", and was about to walk off with the plate. That's when our waitress appeared from nowhere, grabbed the plate from the other waiter's hands, and said ""I got it from here,"" and just walked off. She returned two minutes later saying ""I talked to the manager and he said that too much of the food was eaten from the plate, so we still have to charge you for it. Do you want us to box the rest up?""   Umm... What?! No, we are telling you the food is inedible and literally, two bites were eaten to determine it was no good. And why would we want that boxed up? So I asked the waitress what the manager's name was, because it didn't make any sense. She wouldn't give me a straight answer, and gave me three names of the managers on duty. So I asked again which manager told her that too much was eaten  from the plate. She said she will go try to talk to him again.

In situations like this, stop thinking about what restaurant to visit, get in your car, drive to cheesecake factory, and let your indecisive mind carry on that fight in front of their menu.  This place truly has something for everybody, and they have it in ridiculously huge portions. I have had great chicken dishes, seafood plates, asian cuisine, you name it... and I have not encountered a plate that I wouldn't order again. The only trouble with that is there are so many good choices, it is hard to resist trying something new each time I go. If I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be the crusted chicken romano. I've always been a sucker for anything that includes chicken, cheese, tomato sauce and pasta and this plate blends all of those items together in one gigantic plate. I always end up turning it into two meals and enjoy it every bit as much the next day as leftovers.

I was ill the first time so I don't remember what I ate even though it was only three small bites. It was the flu and not food poisening. So BF and I get seated immediately in the bar. We were told we couldn't have a table as they are reserved for a party of Teachers. Okay, so we sit at one of the Hightop tables. Not my favorites as I can't stand having my feet dangle and not touch the floor. This is a short person phoebia.  The party next to us had two Hi-Tops together and kept ordering different Appys. BF and I looked at their Appys to see what looked good. Our waitress comes over and introduces herself. Her name is Melissa, and she pronounces it ME - lis-sa and not Mel-lisa. Okay, to each his own.  BF gets his normal margarita and I try the JW Pink Lemonaide (Thanks to Cat T.) I enjoyed my drink but they did put a lot of ice in it. It was tangy and the raspberry flavor was promanate. The appetitizers we ordered arrived. It filled our Hi-Top. The Fried calamari was front and center, the Chicken Pot stickers in the back and the Crispy Crab Wontons right in front of me. So, of course, I dive into the Crab wontons. Be careful, these bad boys are HOT, I mean temperature HOT. Burnt my damm mouth on the cheese. More cautiously, I take a second bit. Creamy, the crab can be tasted, dipping sauce was sweet and spicy. Not bad at all. Onward to the calamari, and was very pleasantly surprised. They tasted good. They must have seasoned the batter as you didn't really need the tartar or cocktail sauces. Finally the pot stickers, interesting. It was like a small chicken meatball inside of dough. The filling was seasoned ground chicken and it was full of flavor but I loved the soy and ginger sauce with it.  Of course we didn't finish so the To-Go containers are requested. BF said the calamari would be good as leftovers. He was only half right. They still tasted good but also became chewy.  Oh, I forgot to mention, they serve you a free bread basket with some french bread and a dark whole grain bread.  At this point we are stuffed but I remember Errol M. writing about a piece of Heaven on Earth. I talk BF into ordering a Chocolate Truffle cake to go.

Caitlyn B.,"Austin, TX",180,26,5,5.0,3/10/2014,"I couldn't decide on a restaurant for my birthday. I needed a place that had lots of choices for all the palates in our large party. I settled on Cheesecake Factory, knowing there extremely large menu and building would satisfy both issues.  I became, at first, slightly concerned by the reviews that were all over the place for this location. Then I got annoyed. Most reviews were about decor (that you don't eat) and menu size (you have to be extremely difficult to complain about TOO many choices.) so I decided to give it a shot anyway, having had excellent experiences with other locations in San Diego and Vegas. Our meal was perfect. Our party of 10 and 2 infants was sat immediately despite the after church crows (which is quite busy here in the South.) Between food allergies and picky eaters, we were not an easy group and our server Alicia handled it with ease. She was extremely attentive, but not annoying. She was quick on drink refills and ensuring we had everything we needed. Everything came out perfectly as ordered. I had a delicious piece of chocolate truffle layer cake (since I am sadly dairy intolerant at a place that specializes in cheesecake?)  Overall, loved it, super happy, will be back and asking for Alicia.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=280

Bana W.,"San Diego, CA",35,122,3,5.0,5/23/2012,"I never used to be a fan (not because the food wasn't good, but because of all the calories), but when a friend told me about their skinnylicious menu I had to check it out. I am so glad I did, the skinnylicious menu is freaking AWESOME. Tons of choices, good prices, good portions, and delicious food that isn't going to be 4,000 calories for a meal. I've tried the lettuce tacos, the tuna tartare, the asian spicy chicken salad, the edamame, and a bunch of other things all the times I've gone with my friends. CCF has definitely become a place I like to go to. The best part is because of the skinnylicious menu I don't show a temporary 2-3 lbs gain (from water retention due to salt) on the scale the next day like I do when I go to other places :) I hope the skinnylicious menu stays :) I also love the sangria- and they have a skinny version of that too without the fruit :) And the staff, anytime I have gone, has always been great :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=280

Jon A.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,1.0,4/14/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorite places to go on special occasions, so it was especially disappointing to get such a terrible ""chicken"" burrito. In all fairness, I may have ticked somebody off by sending my order back initially; I'd asked for no cilantro, and it came smothered in cilantro.  But no big deal; mistakes happen; I was not upset at all.  Then, the burrito I did get was a flour tortilla with onion and tomato sauce inside.  There were 3 very small pieces of chicken hidden in all the unseasoned tomato sauce.  There were lots of red onion pieces, so I nibbled on those. I presume that whoever is in the kitchen knows that a chicken burrito is more than unseasoned tomato sauce in a flour tortilla, so my only conclusion is that I made somebody mad by asking for my food without cilantro. I'm not going back there any time soon.  Like the other reviewer said, there are plenty of places just as reasonably priced with better food (and presumably less temperamental cooks).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=280

The bill was right at $100.00 and I left the waiter a $20.00 tip after all it was not his fault. I was overcharged on the meal by having to pay for a higher food item.  I waited for a few days to calm down before going to see the manager Charlie Martindale.  I went to speak with Mr Martindale and gave him a letter of the events along with a copy of the bill.  He seemed concerned and said he would find out who the manager was and find out what had happened.  After not hearing anything for 2 weeks, I contacted Mr Martindale.  He said he thought that by us talking that everything was satisfactory.  Everyone can have a bad night and all I really wanted was an email, a note, or a call saying something like ""I am sorry that we did not live up to our usual quality of service that you have received in the past"".  I did not receive such a small sign of customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=280

My husband ordered the Fresh Strawberry Shortcake off of their specialty dessert menu, described as ""our own shortcake topped with vanilla ice cream, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream.""  My husband's definition of ""shortcake"" is angel food cake or sponge cake or something similar.  This was a biscuit.  He kept saying ""this tastes like a biscuit"" after each bite.  Duh.  The ice cream was tasty and super cold, like below 10 degrees cold.  The strawberries were delicious, as was the whipped cream.

Kristen V.,"Austin, TX",0,23,4,3.0,10/20/2015,"I've eaten here quite a few times.  I always liked the food and enjoyed my overall experience, but the last two times have been less than stellar.  The second to last time I ate here they showed me and my family to a table that was next to a small busy aisle.  Normally I wouldn't care, but we had a baby with us that had to sit in a high-chair so he was sitting in the high-chair in a small aisle with tons of people walking by him.  I was so paranoid his high-chair would get kicked or food would fall on him from all the servers walking by.  Would be nice to have been given a more spacious table in a less busy aisle knowing that we'll need a high-chair and I'm sure the servers would of liked that too since they had to dodge it every time they passed by.  Something to think about next time when showing people to tables.  Now the last time I went TCF I ordered to pick-up my usual Chicken Madeira and Thai Lettuce Wraps.  I was shocked to find most of the lettuce was old, the asparagus on the chicken was old, and half of the chicken madeira was burned making it too hard to eat.  Also, they hardly gave any potatoes with the chicken madeira.  It looked like they just gave me the old and burned food they had because I was picking up and wasn't eating there to actually send this back to the kitchen.  This food was definitely send back to the kitchen quality.  It was such a waste of money and time.  So now my review went from 4-stars to 3.  I will give TCF one more shot and hopefully they will have better quality food next time.  If they don't then sadly I guess I will be done with this place once and for all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=260

The Cheesecake Factory was my favorite restaurant ever but I doubt I'll return to this location. I would rather drive an hour to San Antonio than return to the Austin location restaurant. First off, the hostesses let people cut in line to get our names on the waiting list. And Don't even acknowledge the mistake. We finally get called for our table and what do you know?, the table wasn't ready. Smh. We end up waiting in the middle of walking isle, in the way because the hostesses couldn't plan accordingly for tables that were or weren't clean. And of course more people that came in after us keep getting seated while we are still waiting. Now, our waitress....gosh, was she high?! We ordered a key lime cheesecake. She comes back repeats ""so you wanted the Godiva cheesecake?"" We told her no, the Key lime cheesecake. We think she's got it. She packs it, we pay and leave.

Jim L.,"Austin, TX",273,514,83,2.0,2/6/2010,"Not my choice to eat at a chain for lunch. I have always like the concept of the Cheesecake factory from a visual perspective - great looking place. From a portion control perspective I was looking around, making sure Richard Simmons was not going to come queening out in his striped shorts yelling ""Potion Control! Portion Control!"" when the waiter dropped the food order. My friends split a very underwhelming pepperoni pizza - I was surprised and concerned that between the two of them they ate a quarter of the thing. One other friend ordered a club, but he could not get his mouth around it because it was so big. My turkey burger was good, but I ordered a side salad instead of fries due to the size of things around here.  Therefore, if you are concerned about calorie intake at each meal, ease up on the cheesecake factory by splitting plates or ordering salads without dressing (sugar!). Even better, try another restaurant that caters to your concern for your figure. If you are not concerned about your hourglass (or barrel, as it were), eat up!  I will say that low carb, low sugar Splenda cheesecake sounds like poo, but one of our guests did order it, and it was really no different than the regular in terms of flavor. It felt a bit lighter, and I would still split it, but I was surprised at how good it was.

Serving up their typical smorgasbord of over-sized omelettes and sugary slices, it's a sure bet for every type of eater. Cheesecake Factory is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of place, but our local version has a few perks. For one, it's always packed (bustling atmosphere) but there's ample seating (no suffering for bustling atmosphere). Two, the aforementioned diversity of cuisine. Three, a great place for a group outing when you have varying incomes. Four, the cheesecake is great. C'mon. Admit it. It's really good. Cheesecake Factory is comparable in price to a lot of homegrown Austin restaurants and it's pretty far north for many residents.

We said we were still looking, and as soon we said that, she started to walk away and I had to shout out ""Ma'am!"", because I was expecting her to offer us an appetizer. I ordered the app, another waiter brought us our food, and refills on drinks. Our app took about 10 minutes, and after about 5-10 mins of eating our app, the waitress comes to our table and says, "" Let me get this app out your way"" and starts to walk away again. I shouted at her and said we were ready to order. Wow. She takes the order, the food comes out by yet another waiter, and we eat. At the end, she doesn't offer dessert, and so we asked for a dessert menu, because after all, this is cheesecake factory, and we had told the waitress it was a special day. We get some cheesecake to share and they bring us the plate with a candle. All in all, it was an okay dining experience, but come to find out, they were supposed to bring us bread (in the beginning), and the service really sucked!

Megan M.,"Austin, TX",190,216,14,3.0,11/16/2010,"Humongous Place, humongous menu, humongous portions- yet sometimes humongous doesn't always equal the best. What is somewhat spiffy about the Cheesecake Factory: -They're always very accomodating of large groups.  I typically head in here with groups of around 20 or so for birthdays, bachleorette parties, etc.  Rarely do I come in here with one other person or even just my family. -There's something on the menu for everyone- and I mean everyone.... UNLESS you're on a diet (even the salads have ridiculous amounts of cals in them). -The food isn't half bad and you'll definitely end up taking some home with you.  The appetizers are generous for your party and they also have complementary bread for your table. What isn't so spiffy: -The service is kind of iffy.  Some days you might get good service, others not so much.  For every 2 good servers I've encountered, I've had at least 1 bad one.  One time especially is etched in my brain where I went with just one other person one Sunday evening and we were put in an area all by ourselves and it almost seemed at times that our waiter completely forgot us since there were no other people around.  When he'd come over, it'd seem like a big deal to him that we kind of lost our appetite and just wanted to leave pronto.  I've also had instances in larger groups where the waiters kind of disappear for a while and we have to flag some other waiter down to bring more bread/get a refill/get a menu for a late party, whatever. -The wait time.  Unless you have some kind of reservation, you can expect to wait anywhere from 15 minutes to over an hour.  What's nice, though, is that if you're there solely for the cheesecake, you can grab a slice and head out at their little cheesecake case. -The menu can be absolutely daunting for the unprepared- and in a large group, there's always somebody who has no idea what they want.  At 200+ menu items, it just makes things that much harder for that person to figure out. -I guess it is just a personal peeve of mine, but I don't like that they box up your leftovers for you.  Maybe that's just a fancy thing and I'm crazy, but I'm just not a fan of having someone else box up my plate. So overall, the Cheesecake Factory seems much more about the experience itself than the quality of the food- which is all right.  If I had to recommend something, I'd say the calimari and the orange chicken are pretty good.  You'll pay a premium, but you will get a lot of food for the deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=340

If it's Happy Hour why is in not available through out the entire place, especailly if the rest of the place was practically empty. And it's not like it's a completely separate area. So instead of accommodating paying customers and not allowing us to sit in another area and order from the Happy Hour menu, they lost our business and we went to another place that had HH throughout the restaurant until there Happy Hour was over. Good going, excellent business practice. NOT!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=340

I am giving them TWO STARS for having portions large enough to share and NEGATIVE ONE STAR for charging you to share.

Carlos C.,"Austin, TX",68,73,4,2.0,2/11/2010,"The cheesecake factory isn't one of those places I go to because I really want to. Usually, it's the kind of place where a group I know is going, and I happen to be invited.  There's just something uneasy about seeing that gigantic menu that they have, ranging from Asian-inspired orange chicken, to UK's Shepherds Pie, to Filet Miñon, it's not possible for a restaurant to specializing on ALL those things. Also, who thinks it's a good idea to advertise designer men's jeans in a menu of fried, sugar-fueled, gigantic meals? It just feels way too disney. When I was in Highschool, I dug the ambience. Now I find it a bit gaudy. Why the cheesecake factory looks like an Egyptian palace I have no idea. But that, plus the size of the place, make it seem even more ridiculous.  The food is mediocre, they seem to go for the quantity over quality. My Shepherds Pie was Gigantic, but tasted light ground up hamburger with a mashed potato slop on top. It kind of missed that...flavor...that more authentic pies have. I'd assume that most of their dished are frozen in order to be able to prepare them in time, but I'm not sure. It's kind of expensive for the quality too. Prepare to Spending $15-$20 a person, which might not be that much, but there are better options out there. Go here with a group that makes it fun since everyone can eat whatever they want.

We sat and waited for over 45 minutes, asking twice before our Korean Cauliflower came in a bag. When we took it out to snack, the app was not hot nor crispy, as we had expected, and had fewer florets (only about 11 or so) compared to the dine-in version, mostly crammed with ranch sauce. Also, the breading on the cauliflower floret was not mixed smoothly/well, so there were chalky clumps of raw breading about half the size of a crouton, glommed on.

I have even to-go'ed this dish and it was burnt.  Moving onto service .. the hostess was simply rude, and the management didn't seem to care.

Sara K.,"Dallas, TX",357,245,414,3.0,4/2/2017,"Last time I had Cheesecake Factory was a year ago, so I decided to come here with my boyfriend for dinner on a Saturday. [Service] When we arrived at the restaurant, the wait was pretty long. There were so many high schoolers wearing tuxedos and dresses, so I'm guessing they planned to dine here for prom. And I guess that's why it took us a while to get seated.  The hostess was soft-spoken, so it was difficult to understand what she was saying especially when the restaurant was super loud.  After we got seated, it took at least five minutes for our waiter to show up at our table. He wasn't that welcoming as there was no smile on his face, and his voice sounded monotonous. It also took a while for the food to come out. [Ambience] Very noisy. I can hardly carry out a conversation with my boyfriend throughout our meal.  [Food] I remembered the portion of the dinner pasta is quite large. So my boyfriend and I decided to share a Four Cheese Pasta as we ate a late lunch that day.   The four cheese pasta was really cheesy as you can tell from the name. I liked it, but it wasn't super amazing. We also got the Ahi Tartare as an appetizer, and we absolutely loved it. Ahi Tartare is basically raw tuna mixed with avocado and soy-ginger sesame sauce that comes with chips. The avocado and the ginger flavor made a great combination.  [Parking] Parking is not an issue as the parking lot is very spacious. I was pretty disappointed with the customer service and the noisy atmosphere here.

They said they only take reservations between 3-5 pm!!? Who needs a reservation at that time of day?!?!?! So of course we had to wait a while to be seated...understood, 20 people. They seated us in 3 back to back booths, so we were all split up and could not see or talk to each other. I give it 2 stars only because the food was good. Since we had a party of 20, they could not handle splitting up the checks. It took 45 minutes for them to determine the bill after we ate. We kept asking about splitting the bill from the time we started ordering drinks and they said it would be no big deal at the end. We had kids crying to leave and we had to wait and wait and wait for each bill. When each bill came, they were all wrong.

They categorize their menu so it's not like all of their selections are in alphabetical order. It's really hard to go wrong here. Unless you're the type who doesn't like choices. .  You must try the dulce de leche cheesecake because it's better than all of the rest. Trust me. You must also try their sangria. It's a really refreshing adult beverage which I think you will enjoy.

Too Cool For School G.,"Austin, TX",10,28,10,1.0,8/6/2011,"BULLET POINTS:  - Far too expensive considering their now only-okay food  - Snotty and frigid morons on staff, almost exclusively  - WONDERFUL tropical iced tea (if they still have it)  - Excellent (if vastly overpriced) cheesecake  - NOT WORTH THE COST OR THE WAIT Flashback to 2005.  I was newly transplanted to our first apartment in Austin, hubby's lifetime home minus his stint in the Air Force.  While looking for a nice place to celebrate our move, we came upon the Cheesecake Factory.  We went in with our two children, and proceeded to have the most expensive meal we had ever eaten in our married lives.  But it was worth every single PENNY!  The food was incredible, the tea was amazing, and the service was exceptional.  And that was then. Flash forward to 2007, the last time I set foot inside what I have come to refer to as the Asshole Factory.  I had just gotten off of work, and our tax refund had come in that afternoon.  Naturally, we were all very hungry and looking to enjoy a great meal as a family.  We met up with my sister in law there at 4:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, and were greeted by a surprisingly large crowd of folks waiting to be seated.  We were told that the wait for a table would be about 30 minutes, which we deemed acceptable.  So we sat down.  And as we sat, the crowd around us dwindled slowly.  Then, folks started showing up who were arriving more than 20 minutes after us.  Guess who got seated right away without a reservation?  EVERYONE who arrived after we did!  Since our 30-minute wait had elapsed, we went back to question the frigid bitch of a hostess who had quoted us that wait time.  She said that it was getting to be peak time, and was probably going to be over 20 more minutes.  (In spite of the fact that the assholes who got there less than 5 minutes ago, with parties the same size as or larger than ours, were being seated ahead of us?  Yeah.)  We had waited for an hour when I finally got super pissed off and demanded to see the manager.  The manager said that we should have made a reservation when showing up at peak times.  When I informed him that peak times didn't include 4:30 in the afternoon, he got that snooty ""I think I would know"" look on his face and pretty much dismissed us entirely.  (At least, that was the vibe I got from his turning around and walking away before I was finished talking to his sorry ass.)  I turned to hubby and told him that we were leaving.  Made sure the hostess was watching as I smashed that stupid pager to shreds and tossed it in the garbage.  Went across the parking lot to Serrano's and had a much more palatable meal in less time than we had waited to be seated at the Asshole Factory.  Don't waste your time...they wouldn't know customer service if it kicked them in their holier-than-thou asses.  (And oh, how I wish it would!!!!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=400

I wish I could get it and post it here. Alex, if you ever read this and still have it... Alex showed Amy that having fun with customers is ok, even acceptable. I've trained trainers for years and would hire him to train in one of my own organizations. He led by example, and also gently allowed Amy to do her job, albeit still only her first day in the ""real"" world. Amy shined as well, being very honest and personable, chatting with us about whatever we asked openly and candidly.

The menu went on for days, and all I could think was ""I am not going to order strawberry lemonade or popcorn shrimp."" Andre 3000 would have been proud. We both enjoyed the avocado eggrolls, that tasted like more than just avocado. Both of us were ""eh"" about our pasta entrees.

Pregnant women can be dramatically urgent for good reason. Heavy with impending child, she ate all but one bite of the large spinach artichoke dip and then wolfed down the Chicken Marsala.  The one bite of the dip that I was able to try was excellent - great proportions of creamy and salty.  Her chicken was tender with a hint of sweet wine. When I had first heard of this restaurant, I thought they only sold cheesecake. That is simply a serious head fake.  CHEESEFAKE. Follow the belly, not the head...with over 200 items on the menu, follow the belly, cuz it will soon be FULL...I am usually full long before the time dessert is ordered.  Their tag line is, ""Something for everyone."" Indeed.  And by ""everyone"" they mean all of humanity.  Many vegetarian items.  I nominate the Factory as the greatest place for a gathering with people who cannot agree where to go... people who do not demand fine dining and who enjoy leftovers. The Asian Steak Salad was my favorite meal but it seems that has been discontinued. On this particular day, I was the recipient of a healthy plate of comforting Meatloaf and mashed potatoes - three large slices of loafed meat that were prepared in a very traditional manner. Meatloaf by nature is kind of a dull meal... and this version did not disappoint. The mashed potatoes were white and buttery.

Calls to management have seemingly fallen on deaf ears, they just didn't care about our business I guess. Several times I have been brought undercooked chicken, and once I had to return my bolognese pasta due to a sand-like crunchiness that was due to some error the management explained to me, although I've forgotten the reason. Funny thing was when I had mentioned the texture the response of my waiter and the staff was dubious and even patronizing until I made them taste it. Like I would complain for the fun of it.

The menu appears like a Greek diner menu (pages and pages) till you realize half of it is advertisements. That said they have a huge menu, and I'm told some items are better than others.  The atmosphere is a bit odd. Low lighting the floods every corner of the room and high ceilings with weird faux architecture. The light is supposed to be intimate and romantic I suppose, but it just makes it hard to see in a weird dusky sort of way.  I had a spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce. Very nice cuts of chicken and good lettuce, but beyond that the sandwich was just so so. The fries that came with it were laughable, but the waitress did warn me about that.  At my companions urging I tried the avocado egg rolls. I'm a fan of fusion but abhor fusion-for-fusion's-sake things, and this reeked of it. Luckily I was pleasantly surprised. The filling had great flavor and the wrappers were chewy and tasty. The tamarind/cumino sauce with them was quite nice too!  Lastly the cheese cake, for which the place takes it's name, was pretty mediocre. Nice presentation, but too stretchy. I prefer creamy to the cheesiness. It wasn't bad, but not revolutionary, and nothing to make me want to come back just for this, their ""specialty.""

John B.,"Dripping Springs, TX",25,173,13,5.0,7/13/2007,"I'm probably alone in this but I don't care about decor or menu marketing.  I go to a restaurant to eat.  I don't go to be seen, site see, because it is trendy or what is hot.  I go to eat.  I want good food and I want what I pay for.  I hate french/european poser places with micro portions and astronomical prices.  I've eaten in those places and this is not one of them. If that is your thing then this is not for you.  If I go to a place more than once it is because I like the food and I get my money's worth.  As others have said here the portions are huge.  Yes the menu is full of advertisements.  I don't eat menus, I don't pay attention to the ads.  I have yet to find a restaurant that I could eat the decor, so guess what else I don't care about.  The service is great and I don't mind paying for it. The food here is superb.  I love the ""SPICY AHI TEMPURA ROLLS"".   I recommend the ""PEAR AND ENDIVE SALAD"".   Give the ""MISO SALMON"" a try you will not be disappointed.   I like the ""SHEPHERD'S PIE"", but it is not done in a traditional style, but is tasty none the less.   I cannot over recommend the ""HIBACHI STEAK"" with the Wasabi Mashed Potatoes.  The Sunday brunch is a wonderful experience.  The cheesecakes are very good to excellent and how I first experienced The Cheesecake Factory through their mail order service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=420

I could make a WHOLE cheesecake for what they charge per slice and still have change left over.  They should use sweeter cherry topping on the cheesecake and I think my homemade version is MUCH better, but it's not the worst I've had. The service was okay and our waiter was about what you would expect.  The inside of the restaurant is some sort of Egyptian motif, but very frilly and annoying.  Even my fiance said so and she likes frilly stuff.  It also looks like it's made of plastic instead of stone; very cheap looking.  I kept expecting Lara Croft to come vaulting around the room.

Ian A.,"Austin, TX",58,94,,3.0,9/27/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory at the Arboretum is not a place you want to spend much time in - not only is it nearly always crowded and loud, but if you're here too often you may end up looking like one of the many sad, alone, and very overweight individuals who come here to dine in solitude.

The food really is good, although I can't vouch for everything on the 871-page menu, and the portions are almost disgustingly large. Follow that up by sharing a slice of cheesecake - yet again, I can't vouch for all 41 of them.  If you can't get past the depressitude of the over-stylized architecture (including the faux-Roman inscription ""MAX OCC. 444""), and the sad overindulgence of the patrons, just walk directly to the cheesecake counter to your left and order a slice or two to go, and kick it in the Barnes and Noble next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=420

The result - Worst $9 hamburger ever.  Well - ok, maybe not worst, but not even close to being $9 worth of tastyness.  The fries were pretty good (thin cut, golden nicely salted), but what the hell is up with serving a burger on a long baguette-style sourdough roll?  Far too crusty for a good burger experience.  They also cut the round burger into pieces to fit on the roll - which made it kinda fall apart when eating. Of course - this might just be a case of me always ordering the wrong thing.  The pasta dish ordered by a friend looked pretty good.  I doubt I'll return to give them a second chance though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=420
Zafa R.,"Austin, TX",0,90,58,4.0,6/9/2010,"Date of First Visit: June 27, 2008 Some restaurants have a good, solid dependability. You go and know that whatever you will order will come out a certain way. Call it blandness, generic, whatever. We all have a hankering for these restaurants now and again. The Cheesecake Factory is such a restaurant. It is a very well-known national chain of restaurants. Well, it's more well known for its huge portions (and some might say, their cheesecakes) than for groundbreaking, nouveau cuisine. Although their portions are usually enough to feed a small army, they don't come cheap. I hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in about a year, so I decided to go check out the only one in town, which unfortunately means trekking to the Arboretum area. I wasn't very hungry and wanted something light, so I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps appetizer. There was definitely more than enough! My dining companion ordered the spicy and crispy chicken sandwich. We were both really satisfied with our meals, and ended by sharing the tiramisu (the actual cake, not the cheesecake). It definitely was a ""pick me up"" of a dessert! We went on a Friday night, so predictably, there was a wait, although it was bearable. As far as restaurants go, I don't think you can go wrong, as the Cheesecake Factory offers so many options on their menu that you're bound to find something you like. Again, my only caveat is that this is not cheap dining by any means. I have dined at other locations (mostly in Boston where I used to live) and tried the bar menu. All the appetizers are priced (and portioned) less. It's a great way to try all their appetizers without spending too much. I've had dinners for under $10 just by taking advantage of their bar menu, which is usually from 4:00-6:00pm on weekdays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=420

Tri N.,"Austin, TX",0,18,,3.0,8/6/2007,"So Its been a few days since i've last written a review, No i didn't starve to death, its just hard to write a good bad review sometimes. On top of that i've been on a lean diet so i don't expect places to have the best steamed spinach or egg whites and asparagus.  Anywho, me and 19 others went to cheesecake factory to celebrate a bday. It was great that the manager was able to find us a table within 30 mins. The server was off the hook. But one thing that i really feel about the place is that the food is mediocre. Paying for good food isn't a problem, I mean it was edible but theres no ""wow"" factor. For a place that prizes themselves so much i would think they would at least have better food than cheddars but i guess i'll continue the disappointment until someone else decides to have a event here.

Errol M.,"Austin, TX",894,1006,2401,4.0,7/8/2015,"It's good to have a goal, and mine is to try every flavor of cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. The usual stuff like living the dream & eternal sunshine kind of fall into that ""been there, done that"" category for me, and I've got to have something to wake up for. Incidentally, the journey can often be more rewarding than the destination.  But becoming Cheesecake Jesus requires some careful planning & patience on my part, or the carbs will blow me up like a cheap balloon. With one exception. When the delightful Ashley S texts with ""Let's do dessert,"" the proper response is ""Which two cheesecakes are we trying today?"" And we went with White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle & the S'mores Galore. And once you realize what seems to be melting vanilla ice cream is actually toasted marshmallow, you'll think ""Cool!""  And then you'll think, ""Holy sugar rush, these two cheesecakes are really sweet."" I still think it's hard to beat the Chocolate Tuxedo with Mascarpone mousse here. Let's see, what else? Oh yeah, I guess I should complain about Cheesecake Factory being another corporate chain polluting the local restaurant landscape, but screw that - I like the place. I'm actually more interested in how the upcoming Cheesecake Factory inside Barton Creek Mall will affect this one, because the Arboretum CF has the coolest ceiling ever.

I totally understand if we came at peak hours or if the place was in obvious high demand, we would bounce out of there and no worries, but this was not witnessed at the time of visit. The wait time experienced was not given an excuse ( making the cheesecakes, understaff...whatever the reason), overall bad vibe from staff was felt by our group, and when our little nephew was eyeing the displayed toys ( he figured no lock on door and pull one plush fish out) we paid for his prize at the to-go  area and alerted the front desk manager of their no-lock situation.

I came here after I got married by judge with family that drove here from Houston. We were all hungry, and I wanted to choose a place that was relatively inexpensive and can meet most of the party's food needs/requirements. We chose Cheesecake Factory. What a bad decision.  We sat down within minutes of arriving, but our waiter took almost 20 minutes to greet us and ask us for drinks. Already I knew this visit wouldn't end well, and some members in my family would not like their experience at all.  Our waiter was nice: a young African American boy who seems to have started working there just a couple months prior. He was very friendly and tried to accommodate everyone's needs. He took our drink orders (which really was water and 3 sodas) and returned another 20 minutes later with our drinks. I don't recall him apologizing for the long wait just for drinks. So far, more than half an hour spent and we haven't even ordered our food.  We finally get menus and start browsing. 10 minutes later, every one is ready to order, but guess what? We still had to wait another 27 minutes for the waiter to return. Yes - Although this was a special day for me and my husband, I kept staring at my phone for the time, keeping track of it.  Finally every one gets to put in their order. My grandmother ordered their special and about 8 minutes later waiter came back and told her they were out of something from her selection and she had to choose something else. Why offer a special if you don't even have the products in stock??! Sigh! We get small appetizers 12 minutes later. Not too shabby, right? Then, we literally waited close to 40 minutes for everyone's food to arrive. And when it did, everyone's food did not arrive on time (I figured if they were taking that long maybe they were waiting to have them all ready to bring out at the same time) and some of us had to eat in front of others.  We literally had to walk around to look for a waiter (couldn't find one) and ended up at the front desk to ask for one. There was not one waiter in sight.  To make matters worse, this was on a Saturday, around 1-2pm. The place was not nearly full as I thought it would be. Yet they took so long. Some of my cousins did not like their appetizers and lost their appetite. You get where I'm going with this. They took long for everything when it was not busy AT ALL.  Most of the faulting was on the kitchen. And some on the waiter himself. This is why I hated Cheesecake Factory in the first place. Always experiencing excruciatingly annoying and bad service.

Amanda S.,"Austin, TX",1070,644,5678,2.0,3/10/2015,"It was a friend's birthday and she wanted to have her birthday dinner at Cheesecake factory.  I knew I was in, but wasn't too excited.  I wasn't sure why.  I had been to Cheesecake Factory 2 other times - once in Hawaii with my family and once in Dallas with a large group of girls.  The only thing memorable from those 2 experiences was that I recall their portions being HUGE.  We had a party of 12 and had to wait about 30 minutes or so.  We went over to the bar and ordered drinks.  I ordered the Blueberry Mojito ... mistake on my part.  It was way, way too sweet.  It was really pretty though.  It was also an $11 drink ... a little pricey I think.  We finally got seated.  The service was pretty good from our server.  He never let anyone's water glass get empty, which I always appreciate.   Steve H and I decided to share the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  We knew that these would not be traditional Thai style but we were ok with that.  Steve H had done some research before hand and found that this is supposed to be one of the better dishes offered here.  Oh and by the way not only are the portions huge, but the menu is huge as well.  There are just so many options it is honestly a daunting task to look over the menu fully and make a decision on what to eat.  When our lettuce wraps got delivered they were on a huge plate.  My first thought was where is the chicken?  There was hardly any chicken on the plate for the plate to be so big.  I would have enjoyed my lettuce wraps a bit more if they had more protein in each wrap.  They were mostly veggie wraps with a bit a chicken.   Finally we got to the end of the meal and I was excited for my cheesecake - because who isn't at the cheesecake factory??  I went with the Vanilla Bean cheesecake.  It was definitely the highlight of my meal.   My friend next to me got the BBQ chicken salad she said it was ok, but the BBQ sauce was a little over powering.  I also tasted a Cuban egg roll or something and it was not good at all.   So overall my experience here was - meh.  Will I go back?  Probably not unless it is someone's birthday again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=40

Steve L.,"Round Rock, TX",2,18,1,3.0,1/25/2010,"Quick review: I'll probably update this again after future visits, but this is based on 4 of us stopping by for some appetizers in the mid-afternoon on Sunday.   First of all, the 3-star rating is based on what others had in our group.  Also, the excellent service helped bring up my rating decision.  As anybody who has visited can validate, the restaurant is clean, neat and comfortable.   So...what did I have that pulled the score down?  I had the ""Factory Nachos with Spicy Chicken""  Yeah, I know...""what were you thinking having nachos at a Cheesecake Factory?""  However, this was the listing on the menu that caught my eye and the recommendation by the waiter that these are not your ""average nachos"" with cheese sauce, etc.  Little did I know that, indeed, these were not average...they were well below average.  Chips were plentiful although moderately stale; toppings were meager...including the ""spicy chicken"" which added ~$1.50 to the cost.  Shortening the story: Don't order these...stick with other options. On positive side, one of our party ordered the ""Tex Mex Eggrolls"" and thoroughly enjoyed them. The other two split an order of Fish Tacos and also raved about them. Believe it or not...none of us had cheesecake.  We could have gone to Sorrento's across the parking lot and a) saved money and b) had the same or better Mexican appetizers.

Bo T.,"Austin, TX",34,18,,5.0,9/27/2010,"Please indulge me for a trip down memory lane. You see Cheesecake Factory and Bo have a long history. My first memories of the factory were sitting in the original building on my uncle's lap listening to stories of old days in the factory. Now you probably hear stories of old Austin. Well my uncle was real old Austin. Sometimes he called it Waterloo out of force of habit. He worked in the factory in its heyday. You see the Colorado river (Townlake/Ladybird Lake for the kids) has changed course significantly since before the dams were put in place. The river used to flow as the very site of the factory. The creamcheese was barreled in Philadelphia and floated down river to Austin where it was processed before going to port in Galveston for export to Europe. My uncle rarely got to eat his own cheesecake, it was too precious. The money for one cheesecake in Europe would feed the family for a couple months. Well times have changed. We don't rely on the river to bring the raw cheese. But the building is in the same location, though obviously has been updated quite a bit. I hear that some of the old form pans for turning the cheese into cakes for storage are still in use from the old days.

Amy D.,"Hutto, TX",11,16,4,1.0,2/8/2013,"Friday, February 1 Around 9 p.m. my family and I went to The Cheesecake Factory located in the Arboretum in celebration of my sister's birthday. I was excited not only because it was my sister's birthday (party of 16) but also it was my first time being at The Cheesecake Factory. It is a very nice place but after about 1.5 hours later we were finally seated. The food was pretty good. We left the restaurant around midnight and noticed several cop cars out front. We get to our truck only to find out we've been a victim of ""ATTEMPTED AUTO THEFT."" The thieves broke the lock to our truck and also jammed and damaged/broke our ignition switch. Our truck couldn't even start!! My family was stranded! I was in shock because this has never happened to us, not to mention we couldn't believe this actually happened in a ""nice"" part of town.   So here is my question: Where was the mobile security patrol? Hmmm good question! We filed a police report and were told by officer M. Heyward that 4 trucks (in addition to ours) were also broken into ....WOW UNBELIEVABLE!!   Result: So here is my little family, stranded with no option other than my husband calling a tow truck company from the town we live, which by the way is about 45 minutes away from Austin. I was in complete shock all weekend until Monday. I called Cheesecake Factory early Monday and spoke with manager Sherston to let them know what happened in their parking lot and felt someone should be liable for their customer's damaged property. Unfortunately, Sherston was quite insensitive and quickly referred me to Simon Properties. I called Simon Property early Tuesday only to be instructed to call back after 1 p.m.   Conclusion: When customers visit an establishment, they should have a reasonable sense of security that their belongings will be safe. If something is damaged, there is such thing called insurance....but I find even getting to this point is almost impossible... so far. 2 stars because the cheese cake is excellent !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=220

Mark G.,"Austin, TX",134,275,41,4.0,8/9/2011,"1. I'm reviewing The Cheesecake Factory. Wow... next I'll be reviewing the Olive Garden! 2. That Cuban sandwich kicked substantial amounts of ass. In case you don't know, the menu is epic - quite literally a book, and there's no way any eatery could make so many dishes equally spot-on good. Yet The Factory proves capable of being generally okay and serving up random surprises... Service was surprisingly good throughout the evening. The fried macaroni and cheese appetizer was comfort food on steroids. Drinks were sound. When the entrees arrived, my meatloaf dish just passed comfort food muster, as did the chicken-and-biscuits. It was the girlfriend's Cuban sandwich that really stole the show: I hesitate to confess it, but it was the best Cuban sandwich I've ever tasted.  The cheesecake desserts were vast in selection and decent but not stellar, as expected. Oh, but that Cuban sandwich... Oh, but my...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=300

Darren B.,"Austin, TX",6,45,81,4.0,2/7/2015,I am a fan of the cheese cake factory is business concept. A very attractive atmosphere with affordable food. The booths offer a lot of privacy. The interior design is beyond extraordinary..... I feel like I'm in the lobby of the Hilton in Houston it's quite grand. In fact I'd say if you took a grand hotel restaurant and made it larger and had itself cheesecake you would get precisely the Cheesecake Factory if you like that that's great I do.  Place is very clean staff is very friendly and attractive. But they are a little bit disorganized. I called for a pick up order and it took 30 minutes and it was only a burger and I was on hold for about 8 minutes. It wasn't a busy time it was 11 o'clock in the morning. I was a little surprised. There's a lady named  Kasey. Observing her multicolored nails and Super friendly attitude I became convinced she is quite rare and noteworthy.

Portions are generous, things are prepared right, service is excellent! The menu is ridiculously long. Prepare to read a novel. This is good and bad. Good, why? well they have great options and you'll be sure to find something for everyone here, and Bad you say? if your to the point of starving then the menu is your enemy.

It takes longer to find a place than to actually sit down and eat the food. We came to Austin for a day out and debated for a while where to go until we settled on this place. I went here for prom several years ago and it wasn't good enough to remember. I wasn't expecting much. This restaurant is beautiful. We were immediatly seated and handed a HUGE menu that took me forever to look through. I decided on the Memphis burger, which is a hamburger with swiss cheese, pulled pork, coleslaw, and pickles. This was the best burger I've ever tried! My only problem was that I asked for medium well and was given medium rare. It was still good though. I think my boyfriend had Chicken Pascotta, he said it was good and ate everything but thats doesn't say much since he always does.  Last, we ordered the Rasberry Lemon Cheesecake. I'm not a fan of cheesecak but figured since we're at the Cheesecake Factory we should try it. The cheesecake is sooo good! Its huge too so enough to share and fairly priced.

We came in here also cause I had a gift card that i purchased a while back and a free offer for cheesecake. i thought why not have a lovely mid day lunch here.What I did not enjoy was our meal at the end of it all.The waiter took to long to attend us and bring us our waters,bread,order our food, cheesecake and check(note different waitress brought our food in the end). When we told him why everything was taking so long for our waters and bread, all he said was it was busy on a Sunday.He rubbed off the wrong way, the way he talked and expressed himself,almost as if he did not like attending us. After we waited about 20 minutes between the waters and bread , we were already thinking of leaving. I do not appreciate waiting that long for something so simple. He then took another 15-20 minutes to take our order. After we ate we waited yet another period of time waiting to take our plates and bring us a dessert menu. I mentioned the free cheesecake offer when we received our waters/bread. By this time I just wanted my cheesecake and be done. By the time we finished it no more than 10 minutes cause we took most of the cheesecake home. He had us sit there for another 15 minutes while he was passed by the hall not noticing that our plates were to the slide and we were waiting for the check. Ultimately I flagged him down for the check. He then said that my gift card and cheesecake took too long to process since they were tricky, what is so tricky about that?!  When we were ready to pay he brought the wrong check and took another 10 minutes to bring the right check out.

The friendly but untrained waiter served us the expensive one. A few minutes later while serving the first two of the four entrees, the waiter nonchalantly said to one of our friends, ""I'm sorry. We're out of the sushi."" No kidding! That was our friend's entree choice ... not an appetizer. He had to wait another 20 minutes for his entree which was served as the other three were perusing the cheesecake menu. The icing on the cake was our cheesecake order ... which was why we went there in the first place. My wife and I selected two choices in case they were out of our first choice. ""Do you have these two?"" we asked the waiter. He seemed a bit insulted, ""Of course we do. We ALWAYS have every cheesecake on the menu."" He returned 10 minutes later and said sheepishly, ""Uh. We're out of your two choices. What's your next choice?"" What a joke! We did select another cheesecake, which was tasty but pricey.

It was a Tuesday so it was fairly slow at 5:00 but still very loud and it didn't help that although the place was close to empty we were seated close enough to look into the kitchen and across from the servers station. The call-outs on the overhead in the kitchen were disturbing enough but the constant clatter next to us was the ""icing"" on the cheesecake. I ordered a pomegranate mojito which was OK - a little too sweet, but OK. My friends were just drinking wine and beer so no real challenges there. The next obstacle is the bound book that they call a menu. Finally after reaching a decision - comes to find out that I couldn't order it the way I wanted so I opted for the eggplant sandwich and Caesar salad. The plate came heaped with lettuce heavily coated in dressing. It was so over powering I couldn't eat more than 2 bites... The sandwich was cold. The bun was way too big for the tiny 3 pieces of eggplant that was on it. There was actually more grill red onion than eggplant on the roll. (which I had also asked to be left off - why get it if you don't want to eat it?). I proceeded to eat the cheese and lack of other veggies on this $12 plate. The waiter came to clear the table and commented that it looks like I didn't like my food - I didn't. I commented on the salad and he said - yeah, I know.... What? Really?... to add more insult to the day, my friends ""insisted"" I ordered cheesecake for my birthday - after all it is the Cheesecake Factory. SO I did - and of course the one I wanted - they were out of, but he didn't tell me that until he was delivering the other two to the table.

Victoria T.,"Austin, United States",5,31,13,2.0,1/10/2017,"We came in Sunday afternoon at 3:30pm expressly to buy a quick appetizer to-go. The restaurant was slow, with few customers and the countergirl at the cheesecake display area said it would be 10 minutes' wait.  We sat and waited for over 45 minutes, asking twice before our Korean Cauliflower came in a bag. When we took it out to snack, the app was not hot nor crispy, as we had expected, and had fewer florets (only about 11 or so) compared to the dine-in version, mostly crammed with ranch sauce. Also, the breading on the cauliflower floret was not mixed smoothly/well, so there were chalky clumps of raw breading about half the size of a crouton, glommed on. It was so unprofessional, that if we were eating inside the restaurant we would have sent it back to the kitchen.

It came out spicy (this is NOT a spicy dish), burnt, tough, and cold. Obviously this is the only dish I order if I have this many times to speak for the bad cooking on this one dish. I have even to-go'ed this dish and it was burnt.  Moving onto service .. the hostess was simply rude, and the management didn't seem to care. We proceeded to inform the manager on duty at the time about our incident and he kind of shrugged and said ""I guess we'll have to have a talk later."" The server was busy talking to her friends and our food came out mediocre. My dish was cold and I had to ask multiple times for a refill on water.  It is sad to go from a 5 star review to a 2 star review but that's life I guess. Some businesses stay on it and some just don't. Too bad there isn't another location we could go to.

The items are priced high, but note that you will get a portions big enough to share with someone, or last you 2 meals. The avocado toast and calamari are good apps to share.

Sara K.,"Dallas, United States",357,247,414,3.0,2/4/2017,"Last time I had Cheesecake Factory was a year ago, so I decided to come here with my boyfriend for dinner on a Saturday. [Service] When we arrived at the restaurant, the wait was pretty long. There were so many high schoolers wearing tuxedos and dresses, so I'm guessing they planned to dine here for prom. And I guess that's why it took us a while to get seated.  The hostess was soft-spoken, so it was difficult to understand what she was saying especially when the restaurant was super loud.  After we got seated, it took at least five minutes for our waiter to show up at our table. He wasn't that welcoming as there was no smile on his face, and his voice sounded monotonous. It also took a while for the food to come out. [Ambience] Very noisy. I can hardly carry out a conversation with my boyfriend throughout our meal.  [Food] I remembered the portion of the dinner pasta is quite large. So my boyfriend and I decided to share a Four Cheese Pasta as we ate a late lunch that day.   The four cheese pasta was really cheesy as you can tell from the name. I liked it, but it wasn't super amazing. We also got the Ahi Tartare as an appetizer, and we absolutely loved it. Ahi Tartare is basically raw tuna mixed with avocado and soy-ginger sesame sauce that comes with chips. The avocado and the ginger flavor made a great combination.  [Parking] Parking is not an issue as the parking lot is very spacious. I was pretty disappointed with the customer service and the noisy atmosphere here.

Sharon Y.,"Austin, United States",390,77,160,2.0,2/5/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is an appropriate place to go to for celebrations because the atmosphere is warm and it's easy to accommodate big parties.  As for the food, it's pretty much the same at any Cheesecake Factory you decide to go to. The plates are pretty large and the quality is average -- definitely not quality food, but it suffices. The pricing is consistent with your typical dinner Italian meal, so it's not bad especially since the portions here are generally quite large.  I don't usually go here when I'm craving Italian food, but Cheesecake Factory seems to be a trademark place for celebrations. I haven't set foot in one of the branches in a while, I was excited to visit this nostalgic restaurant. I usually consider Cheesecake Factory as a 3-star restaurant, but the location in Austin seems more disappointing because of their clumsy snd disorganized service. The wait time was said to be 15 minutes but we waited for over half an hour, our server forgot to bring bread out & shoved my burning hot entree plate into my hand when placing it on the table, and by the end of our meal, everyone's water cup in my party was empty because nobody came to refill it. The food took longer than usual to come out, and when our server came to hand us a slice of cheesecake, she moved too quickly and the whip cream fell off --to which she simply said ""oh well!"" and left.  Perhaps I came on an off day, but I didn't have high expectations when coming to this restaurant. So for every person in my party to constantly bring up how dissatisfied they felt during the dinner, I'm not too sure if I'm going to be coming back to this location.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=80

Finished off with the salted macadamia nut cheesecake only to be disappointed because half of the slice was caramel too sweet with a think layer of nuts (for $7.50)....should've stuck to the original flavor.

Michael F.,"Pflugerville, United States",0,7,,1.0,20/3/2017,"I have not been to the Cheesecake Factory in a while. I was totally surprised when I was turned away at the door, and was not welcome. I was a victim of discrimination, and I can tell you why. The the most law abiding Texans are License to Carry a handgun people. At the entrance, high and to the right, on a window at about seven to eight feet high (way above eye level, which I don't believe is legal anyway) I saw a TPC 30.06 and 30.07 sign, to keep LTC out. This of course only  tells criminals, that they have no one to fear, so if they want to, they can commit any violent crime they want. Since they break laws for a living, the sign is a joke to them. There was no armed security there either, which tells me Cheesecake management don't care about their employees, or customers and there families safety. This of course, leaves the Cheesecake Factory wide open for a lawsuit for not having adequate security and not allowing for customers or staff to protect themselves. Therefore I cannot recommend this restaurant, for it's dangerous and discriminatory practices. Take your business elsewhere.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=140

Lily W.,"San Diego, United States",190,222,112,4.0,14/2/2014,"Come here on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday because that's when our server Janelle works! She's awesome! Cheesecake Factory is one of those strangely elusive chain restaurants that holds a special place in my heart. I spent my teenage and college years in Michigan and surprisingly there is NO Cheesecake Factory anywhere in the state. Strange, because Troy, MI (my hometown) is like the king of all large chain restaurants. Regardless, because of this cruel twist of faith that withheld Cheesecake Factory from my taste buds, I was determined to try it one day. I ended up trying it on a trip to Chicago and well, I didn't know what to order and was instantly overwhelmed by the monstrous menu. I remember the meal being decent, but somehow it didn't live up to my hope and dreams. Fast forward to two years later when I moved to Houston. I mentioned to my boyfriend at the time that I wasn't sure if I liked Cheesecake Factory and he insisted we go that day. I believe I got the Shrimp Etouffee and actually liked it. He got the Chicken Madeira which blew my Etouffee out of the water. I was sold. Since then I've gone to a few Cheesecake factories in various cities around the US. This location happens to be the only location in Austin. I like that it's almost always open until 11PM which is great for late night desserts! Most of the servers are pretty good but some standout ones are Natasha (I believe she introduces herself as 'Tashi), Tanner, and of course, as mentioned in my tip, Janelle.  I still go for the Chicken Madeira, but I've tried a few other items on the menu and have to admit that the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Thai Lettuce wraps are pretty good too. I like the Upside-Down Pineapple Cheesecake and upon another Yelper's recommendation tried the Banana Creme Pie Cheesecake and they're my current favorites. Like I've mentioned in previous reviews, I like chain restaurants when I'm in doubt and looking for a halfway decent meal. They have standards.... that's got to count for something right?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=140

I understand this was the second weekend of spring break so we expected a long wait especially with SXSW also going on but...when we arrived we were told it was it would be 40 minutes  but we actually waited for over an hour (64 min) to be exact.  The wait is not the restaurants fault. I get it but, if we were told it was an hour we would not have stayed.  And due to the cool snap, there was pretty much wall to wall people in the entrance. Standing...for 64 minutes.... We had a variety of entrees from a club sandwich to sesame ginger chicken, the chicken was spicier than expected. The rest of the food we ordered was fairly expensive and pretty ordinary.   The waitress and hostesses were working their tails off, the kitchen was backed up (understandably.

David S.,"Ashaway, United States",47,83,6,3.0,7/6/2015,"The wait times are a bit long if you want a table.  However since this is a family restaurant, the bar usually has open seats and if you eat there, they will spread cloth napkins. The free bread is average to below average.  Not fresh, not sure if it's made on the premises.  It is a filler. Not sure what the exact name of the appetizer is, it is 2 Salmon wraps that were deep fried then cut diagnally to make ""4"" pieces served on a HUGE bowl filled with diced red lettuce.  Garnishment I understand but not really understanding this presentation. Since I was at the bar, service was immediate and my beer glass was never empty.  The bar staff is very responsive and friendly.  The people delivering the food are courteous and friendly as well. I had the Bang bang chicken and shrimp and overall it is okay.  Most of their dishes seem very original, some updated Asian fusion dishes. The cheesecake was the highlight of the meal, obviously.  The key lime cheesecake was great. Although they only have 2 $'s on the rating should be 3 $'s.  Total bill for 2 people with a share appetizer and 3 drinks each, seperate entrees, 2 orders of cheese cake came out to $115, not including tip. The appearance of the place reminds me of mediterranean architecture with a lot of curves, gold/gilded color bases.  It looks pleasant. This place looks very clean.  The staff cleans up well.  Room between seats/tables are about average.  You don't feel packed but due to the layout, conversations carry so if you're looking to having a serious conversation, you would have to sit next to each other.

After waiting 30 minutes two people in our party were told they needed to change their order or it would add another 20 minutes to the already too long wait. We ordered cheesecake afterwards and that took 25 minutes. I tried to follow up with the server and then a manager and they really seemed dismissive.

For $67 I wanted to scream at this meal.   I got the endive salad to start.  Blegh. I took the waiter's suggestion and got the salmon special.  I don't normally order salmon, but I'm trying to eat more fish.  So away I go.  I get it and don't love it.  I chalk that up to, maybe I don't really love salmon.  As I take a few more bites I don't think that it's cooked all the way.  BUT, I don't cook salmon so what the hell do I know.  I become paranoid and quit eating it.  It also just had this bizarre taste, I can only liken it to plastic.  It also had some sort of coconut sauce that the rice was in and that was really sweet and just not good to me. BF got roasted chicken which came with some veggies and mashed potatoes.  I ate his carrots and enjoyed them.  The potatoes also just had this bizarre taste that I couldn't put my finger on, but it wasn't good. Still a little hungry, and thinking, well we are at the Cheesecake Factory, let's get cheesecake, we get two desserts to go (I'm ready to go home). We got the classic, cheesecake with strawberries, and a piece of Tiramisu.  The cheesecake was rather soft, and had more of a sour taste to it than I am accustomed to.  It was topped with fresh strawberries, but they were in some sort of gross jelly.  The Tiramisu was pretty good. The price is what killed me, for a meal that wasn't good we spent seventy bucks.

When you have a menu that is that HUGE, its hard to be great at everything. . .and u know half or more cannot be fresh.  I ordered the tuna tartare the last 2 times I've been. Next time instead of an entrée I'm ordering 2 as my meal.  This last visit I ordered a margarita flat bread ...it was eh. . the tomatoes were cut to thick so that's all you tasted, tomato, and it still tasted raw to me, or undercooked.    The bf ordered the Navajo. no thanks, he said he'd never order that again. he said it was too big and difficult to eat. Next time he said he'd order chicken stuffed tortillas (basically quesadillas).  We shared the red velvet cheesecake. never disappoints, never gets old. THIS is what they make great, and they know it. why waste calories on food and alcohol when this is about all I've enjoyed from CF. Not the drinks, not the pasta (every dish I've gotten just wasn't good), not the salads (I love cobb salad but theirs is just lettuce it felt like).  And so to sum up, either or the tuna tartare, a pizza (the girl next to me had a pepperoni pizza that looked great. . .) or the cheesecake.

They gave me so much free bread. And the portions they offer? Legendary.  This particular visit was my first post-hospital-solid-foods-experiment. I kiiiiiiiiind of managed.  I ate two chicken strips and a few bites of succotash. A few things I noted: the bread came AFTER we ordered our meals, whereas it used to come pretty freely before. The noise isn't as loud anymore. I don't know if they've turned down the music or if I just came at the ""right time."" The service is more on point than I've ever seen it in terms of timeliness, but not in terms of consideration. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich. What pulled pork they had was not up to par and the manager came out to apologize. She asked if there was something else he wanted and also brought out his side order of sweet potato fries. I may be obnoxious (okay, fine, whatever, call me obnoxious) but when his re-order came out without a side, I thought that was a little tacky. You've inconvenienced a customer and your consolation is something that they're having to pay for already and you're not replacing it with anything or comping the bill at all? Call me a product of modern society, but there's something called ""going the extra mile"" and they certainly did not in this situation.  My cajun chicken strips were mildly spiced. I get that you're operating for the masses, but just call them chicken strips. There's nothing cajun about them, even if they are still appetizing.

Lindsey B.,"Austin, United States",1,69,3,1.0,15/1/2016,"While I have had several good experiences at this location, my last visit was atrocious.  1) we were sat at the smallest booth in the history of mankind. (and we weren't asked whether we would like to wait longer for a larger booth). Those small tables are NOT big enough for 2 people. THEY ARE A ONE PERSON TABLE. But lets be honest this isn't even the beginning. 2) Ordered the sliders and they came with ketchup on them. I don't know ANY nice sit down restaurant that ever put ketchup on its burgers. In my opinion it's basically a Mcdonald burger at the point. While it did say that it came with Ketchup on the menu, I just assumed it would come on the side like EVERY other single sit down restaurant. Lol. But I assumed wrong. Well then when I noticed there was ketchup on my sliders, I tried to get the waiter. He had disappeared completely. Well then when I finally tracked him down, he didn't want to let us send them back and get something else. He then suggested we order a kids slider plate. So I did and then the burgers came out and the buns felt like they had just been pulled out of the microwave - you know like those white castle burgers you heat up in the microwave. That's what they tired to served me. So on the 3rd round my food was finally right.....We thought that would the end of the terrible dinner... But no... 3) We get our check and review it and the waiter goes to run it. It comes back with a bill for like $20-30 more. He had ran our card on a higher bill....

Sara S.,"Austin, United States",2,28,10,1.0,18/12/2016,"Let's preface this with; there is a Five Guys in the same lot, I would recommend them over Cheesecake Factory any day. Upon walking in, you'll discover the decor is oddly fancy? There are Pharaoh heads painted above the hostess station, it's quite comical really. My initial thoughts: ""Wow, this is a bit cheesy and over the top."" Once we received the menu, it confirmed my over-the-top gut instinct. The menu is a ring bound book of way too many dishes.  So, we ended up trying lunch today, anyway. We ordered; the Avocado Egg Rolls, the ""lunch serving"" of Fettuccini Alfredo and a Chicken Parma sandwich. The avocado egg roll was greasy, no crunch at all. The sauce that came with it was grossly sweet. We had to send it back.  If you enjoy gummy fettuccine and super heavy Alfredo sauce, this is the place for you. I took a couple bites and was over it. The green peas I had added to it USUALLY breaks up a heavy dish like this, but even that couldn't save it. Also, the ""lunch serving"" of this dish is only about a dollar cheaper than the dinner serving. Wow, what a savings.  The Chicken Parm sandwich was more of a bread sandwich with a tiny piece of chicken. The breading on the chicken also slid off mid bite. Marinara was bland. My boyfriend had ordered a salad with this dish and they gave us his salad dressing about 15 minutes prior to receiving his meal (which was brought to us with French fries and no salad).

The waiter tried to bring out more bread in hopes of it being better, but they were all burnt. haha. It was okay. I started off with the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. I love Jamaican food, but I should have known better ordering it from anywhere other than a Jamaican spot. The presentation was perfect, but I was expecting my food to be spicy. It was so sweet and taste like pineapple. I decided to send it back and try something different. I probably should have got the gumbo, but I opted for the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. This was good, don't get me wrong, but it would have tasted better with rice or a bowtie pasta. I love that it still came with a little heat behind it because I love spicy food.

I have tried different cheesecakes so hopefully I get a little credit there.  The last two times at the arboretum location we've had to ask for bread so if you're not in the know, ask for it bc the wheat is very tasty. I ate 6 pieces tonight. Whoops. I was hungry. And if you ask for extra you'll have extra to take home with your leftovers.  We got the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer tonight and they were very good. You should probably get them too.  I enjoy the Chicken Crusted Romano and I only get about a third in before I stop myself so I will have room cheesecake. I tried a friends luau salad and it's pretty good as well.

If you do come in between the rushes, you can likely just walk in and be seated immediately. Sweet. Service is great. The cheesecakes are great as always. I'm personally a fan of the 30th anniversary cheesecake, it's the perfect combo of chocolate and regular cheesecake so it's not too chocolatey. The other chocolate ones are simply too much in my opinion (though if you're a chocolate addict they'll be right up your alley), but this one is a combination of chocolate cake and plain cheesecake, so for me it's perfect. So good. The vanilla bean cheesecake is also phenomenal.

On to the review. Very expansive menu got me thinking ""well, what are you good at?"" So I just ordered a burger. It was good, albeit with special sauce, which I asked they not add - so that irritated me a bit. The reason for 3 stars is that I just didn't feel welcome. If I'm going to spend $13 for a burger and $20 for salmon I expect the hosts and wait staff to at least pretend to be happy and act like they want to do a good job. The workers just looked like robots, as if they were just going through the motions.  Our orders took forever and my burger was wrong, but in the end, its the customer service that sucked.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=260

Tom M.,"Austin, United States",37,217,37,2.0,31/5/2012,"I had not stepped foot in a Cheesecake Factory since 2004 and I was reminded why.  Severely overrated.  The menu read like ""War and Peace"" and the decor was way too Vegas for me.  It looked like the interior of a Shriners' temple. You know, the guys that wear Fezzes and ride the mini bikes in the Fourth of July parade.   With a menu that large it is statistically impossible for all the items to be good and that is a problem.  The Turtle Cheesecake was OK,  but the service was good; friendly and appropriately chatty.  For $60 for two, no alcohol and OK food, I don't see a return visit anytime soon.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=260

Of course their cheesecakes are very good and there are all different kinds like chocolate, vanilla bean and now pumpkin.

Took home their 30th anniversary cheesecake, it's layered w/ chocolate cake and has chocolate frosting too.  So very damn good.   They have such a large menu - - that's a good thing and a bad thing.  You get variety, but if you're fickle then you could be in trouble in trying to decide what to get.  I like the fact that they recycle in some new dishes - - this was the 1st time I have ever seen Kobe Beef on their menu.    Prices seemed to have gone up a bit, average dinner plates cost about $15.95.  I wanna say that's about a $2 difference from the last time I was there.  Still a great place to go and one of my favorite chains, good ambiance and atmosphere too.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=260

The hostess seemed annoyed and said just come back in 20 min. We came back and 9 of us were squished into a round booth in a back corner. I looked up and noticed everyone was sweating. I asked the waiter if the AC could be turned down and he replied, ""the ac is broken, imagine how my days been"" and walked off. Our waiter came by and let us know that the cheesecake was taking about 30 min due to the high volume. Then the waiter just stood there and then asked what Cheesecake we wanted. I said ""oh I didn't realize we were ordering that right now"", and he said ""yeah that's why I told you it was taking 30 min"" even though this was before we even ordered our entrees.

The usual stuff like living the dream & eternal sunshine kind of fall into that ""been there, done that"" category for me, and I've got to have something to wake up for. Incidentally, the journey can often be more rewarding than the destination.  But becoming Cheesecake Jesus requires some careful planning & patience on my part, or the carbs will blow me up like a cheap balloon. With one exception. When the delightful Ashley S texts with ""Let's do dessert,"" the proper response is ""Which two cheesecakes are we trying today?"" And we went with White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle & the S'mores Galore. And once you realize what seems to be melting vanilla ice cream is actually toasted marshmallow, you'll think ""Cool!""  And then you'll think, ""Holy sugar rush, these two cheesecakes are really sweet."" I still think it's hard to beat the Chocolate Tuxedo with Mascarpone mousse here. Let's see, what else? Oh yeah, I guess I should complain about Cheesecake Factory being another corporate chain polluting the local restaurant landscape, but screw that - I like the place.

Esther N.,"Austin, United States",0,16,18,2.0,25/11/2016,"I would like to give 2.5 stars but 3 or more definitely isn't deserved. I came here after I got married by judge with family that drove here from Houston. We were all hungry, and I wanted to choose a place that was relatively inexpensive and can meet most of the party's food needs/requirements. We chose Cheesecake Factory. What a bad decision.  We sat down within minutes of arriving, but our waiter took almost 20 minutes to greet us and ask us for drinks. Already I knew this visit wouldn't end well, and some members in my family would not like their experience at all.  Our waiter was nice: a young African American boy who seems to have started working there just a couple months prior. He was very friendly and tried to accommodate everyone's needs. He took our drink orders (which really was water and 3 sodas) and returned another 20 minutes later with our drinks. I don't recall him apologizing for the long wait just for drinks. So far, more than half an hour spent and we haven't even ordered our food.  We finally get menus and start browsing. 10 minutes later, every one is ready to order, but guess what? We still had to wait another 27 minutes for the waiter to return. Yes - Although this was a special day for me and my husband, I kept staring at my phone for the time, keeping track of it.  Finally every one gets to put in their order. My grandmother ordered their special and about 8 minutes later waiter came back and told her they were out of something from her selection and she had to choose something else. Why offer a special if you don't even have the products in stock??! Sigh! We get small appetizers 12 minutes later. Not too shabby, right? Then, we literally waited close to 40 minutes for everyone's food to arrive. And when it did, everyone's food did not arrive on time (I figured if they were taking that long maybe they were waiting to have them all ready to bring out at the same time) and some of us had to eat in front of others.  We literally had to walk around to look for a waiter (couldn't find one) and ended up at the front desk to ask for one. There was not one waiter in sight.  To make matters worse, this was on a Saturday, around 1-2pm. The place was not nearly full as I thought it would be. Yet they took so long. Some of my cousins did not like their appetizers and lost their appetite. You get where I'm going with this. They took long for everything when it was not busy AT ALL.  Most of the faulting was on the kitchen. And some on the waiter himself. This is why I hated Cheesecake Factory in the first place. Always experiencing excruciatingly annoying and bad service.

Amy D.,"Austin, United States",56,228,144,2.0,14/3/2016,"The cheesecake is good, but that's about it.  I went there recently for one of my favorite things: artichoke appetizer. Much to my dismay, they no longer offer that item. I decided to try the spicy shrimp appetizer instead. That was a big mistake. I should've just walked away.  Along the lines of disappointment, the mojito I had that day was a huge disappointment. The mint and lime weren't really muddled into the drink. That made the drink basically a soda drink. What a downer.  I won't be back to eat at Cheesecake Factory again. If I ever have a craving for cheesecake, I'll get takeout.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=40
Sandy N.,"Sacramento, United States",266,876,2178,4.0,22/6/2015,We came in out of town since I had an appointment to go to in Austin.  Got there around 2pm and was sat down quickly. We ordered a couple appetizers and two lunch places.   I ordered from the Skinnylicious menu - steak medallions with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My hubby got the Chicken Bellagio - basil pasta topped with arugula salad.  He wanted to try something different from what he usually would order at a restaurant and i suggested that.  He loved his meal.    The fried calamari was delicious and my hubby loved the crab artichoke dip.   My steak medallions were cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful.

I had the Miso Salmon and it was delicious and the filet tender. Topped it off with a cherry cheesecake that hit the spot. This place is a bit pricey so here are a couple of tips. The lunch menu is served until 5 pm so come early and save money. The other tip is you'll have quite a wait if you show up at peak times so you now have a second reason to get there early.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=40
Amanda S.,"Austin, United States",1070,644,5678,2.0,10/3/2015,"It was a friend's birthday and she wanted to have her birthday dinner at Cheesecake factory.  I knew I was in, but wasn't too excited.  I wasn't sure why.  I had been to Cheesecake Factory 2 other times - once in Hawaii with my family and once in Dallas with a large group of girls.  The only thing memorable from those 2 experiences was that I recall their portions being HUGE.  We had a party of 12 and had to wait about 30 minutes or so.  We went over to the bar and ordered drinks.  I ordered the Blueberry Mojito ... mistake on my part.  It was way, way too sweet.  It was really pretty though.  It was also an $11 drink ... a little pricey I think.  We finally got seated.  The service was pretty good from our server.  He never let anyone's water glass get empty, which I always appreciate.   Steve H and I decided to share the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  We knew that these would not be traditional Thai style but we were ok with that.  Steve H had done some research before hand and found that this is supposed to be one of the better dishes offered here.  Oh and by the way not only are the portions huge, but the menu is huge as well.  There are just so many options it is honestly a daunting task to look over the menu fully and make a decision on what to eat.  When our lettuce wraps got delivered they were on a huge plate.  My first thought was where is the chicken?  There was hardly any chicken on the plate for the plate to be so big.  I would have enjoyed my lettuce wraps a bit more if they had more protein in each wrap.  They were mostly veggie wraps with a bit a chicken.   Finally we got to the end of the meal and I was excited for my cheesecake - because who isn't at the cheesecake factory??  I went with the Vanilla Bean cheesecake.  It was definitely the highlight of my meal.   My friend next to me got the BBQ chicken salad she said it was ok, but the BBQ sauce was a little over powering.  I also tasted a Cuban egg roll or something and it was not good at all.   So overall my experience here was - meh.  Will I go back?  Probably not unless it is someone's birthday again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=40

It'd been 7 years since we last dined here.  I made it in and my Wife had our table.  She and I were seated on the backside of the restaurant in a dirty bench.  We sat across from a family that seemed to really enjoy their food.   We ordered the buffalo blast appetizers. I hadn't eaten them in years and they were good.  My Wife ordered the grilled pork chop and I the chicken bellagio. It was way more food than we needed on top of the apps. We waited at least twenty five minutes to get our food.   My Wife said the flavor of her dish wasn't to good.  I'm not sure she made it through a third of her dish.  I remember her mashed potatoes were quite lumpy.

TCF has an overwhelming variety of sandwiches, salads, entrees and desserts. Narrowing down your choices can be a task in and of itself so consider looking at the menu on-line ahead of time. As you order, remember my first observation and consider sharing with a companion or plan on eating the leftovers for lunch.  As far as taste goes, I'm assuming that because TCF tries to cater to every taste, many of the entrees labeled ""spicy"" are simply not spicy.

Ven S.,"Austin, United States",2,24,32,1.0,7/2/2016,"My wife and I went to the Cheesecake Factory quite regularly. Between taking visiting family and friends there or just going for dinner, we were there once every 3 weeks at least. Most of our experiences thus far have been positive. Food and beverage is pretty tasty albeit quite mainstream to appeal to ""the masses."" The only complaint I ever had till tonight was the long wait on busy nights, and that is expected and never warrants a negative review. However, tonight was a different experience. We met two of our close friends for dinner there tonight, and took our 2 month old baby too. We got our apps, and beverages ordered with our server - Cassidy. I ordered a Pineapple Moscow Mule. The apps showed up and my drink came too. However, amidst being engrossed in conversation with our friends and sampling the appetizer, I didn't notice for a few sips that I had the wrong beverage. After more than half the drink was gone (not more than 3 sips with the amount of ice these drinks have), I noticed that my drink was extremely sweet and full of mint leaves, and did not taste of vodka at all. Tasted more like rum (mojito). I told our waitress that although my drink was delicious, it couldn't possibly be a mule (even with it being pineapple flavored) and if she could possibly check with the bartender about it. She returned saying that the bartender had made an error and made a pineapple mojito instead of the ordered pineapple Mule. She asked me if I would like to keep the same drink or have her make the correct drink. I requested for the correct beverage to be made. The correct drink arrived and it was admittedly quite delicious. We continued with our meal and got 4 entrees at our table as well. After hearty laughs and chatting, and boxing our left overs, we requested checks. When the check arrived, I noticed that our check had 2 Pineapple Moscow Mule's on it. (I just had the one). This is where it went down hill. I asked for the waitress and asked her if there was an error, since they had brought me the wrong beverage and I only had 1 of the Mule. She was being very nice and apologetic and told me she would have to call her manager since she was under 21 and couldn't tell the drink was incorrect when she served it (not sure that is a valid excuse either). Up walks the manager - CHARLIE MARTINDALE. This gentleman shouldn't be even washing dishes or busing dirty tables, let alone be in charge of managing anything with patrons. He walked up to the table and almost rudely said ""Is there a problem here?"" I explained to him that my beverage had been prepared incorrectly and that the waitress and bartender agreed that they had made the wrong drink and replaced it with the correct one, and that I somehow had been billed twice. This is where it gets simply unbelievable. He says ""But did you drink the first drink?"" I explained that I had taken a few sips of it since I was preoccupied before realizing it was wrong. He said ""You drank too much of that drink for me to be able to comp it."" I informed him that both, his waitress and his bartender had agreed to the error of preparing the incorrect drink. To this he snapped back to me ""You drank the drink, didn't you?"" He then said he would fix the price of one of the Mule's to that of a Mojito and that it would reduce my bill by 50 cents or so. I could not believable what I was hearing. The funny part is that it isn't even that $9 that the beverage cost that I was unhappy about. It is the way this manager of a higher-end chain handled such a petty issue with rudeness and talking down to a patron that really rubbed me the wrong way. At this point I told him that I no longer required his help and paid off the bill as is. Needless to say, there was no tip left on this bill. My wife and I will never go to this or any other Cheesecake Factory or Grand Lux Cafe (same ownership). Our friends who accompanied us tonight also left with a bitter taste in their mouth and will no longer frequent this establishment either. Cheesecake factory had provided us with a reasonable and tasty dining option thus far, and hired what seemed like good staff from all our experience till today. However, like it is said too often ""All it takes is one."" This one rotten apple was the manager - CHARLIE MARTINDALE. The waitress Cassidy was being extremely apologetic when I asked for her name and the manager's name. She said if it was up to her, she would have comped the drink since it was her error. She repeated that since she was newer and under 21, she didn't have the required authority to modify alcoholic beverage orders. We have returned home with a bitter taste in our mouths, and this review is what has resulted of it. Sorry Cheesecake Factory - you need to do a better job of training your managers in customer relationship management - at least this one!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=120

Last month I came here, I ordered black peppered Jamaican shrimp. The rice was disgusting, it was so crunchy.... Obviously we all know rice isn't suppose to be dry and crunchy especially since this was one of my favorite entree. The shrimp was super small.... Not worth it. This month I came here for dinner and got my other favorite chipotle pasta. We didn't receive any bread from the start but that's fine. It's just bread. They forgot the chicken and realized that they gave me the wrong vegetarian dish instead of the normal dish. Which is okay. When I received the chipotle pasta, the size of it was smaller than lunch portion. It was like 10 bites max and 5 small pieces of chicken. The plate is big... Sure but not the dish itself. As a usual fan of chipotle pasta, I know what their size is suppose to be. I've been coming to this place for years now ordering the same entrees.

The food is good, the portions are large (keep that in mind when you look at prices) but the service is consistently terrible.  I can't tell if they've been understaffed (for two years?) or if people just aren't getting the proper training. Multiple times we've had to wait 15+ minutes to be greeted. Then, once we put in orders and the drinks are delivered, no one seems interested enough to stick around for us to order our food.  It's like pulling teeth. This past Friday was especially terrible. Once there were more tables seated outside it got better, but in the beginning it was like we were an inconvenience. After years of working in the restaurant industry I do understand the challenge of handling the single large party on the patio, but come on. You have a patio that people want to use, so figure out how to service the patio without making it so obvious that it's out of your way. Do you want our money or not? I don't like having to flag down other waiters to find out where our server is. Waiting 15 minutes to be greeted (when the servers are huddled up by the bar chatting, or looking out at our table like ""are you going to take it? I'm not."") and missing out on happy hour pricing because of if also isn't on my list of favorite things.

And glad for two Christmas Gift Cards from the Cheesecake Factory to enjoy w my spouse.  We found this Cheesecake location on Yelp. I was a little concerned w the prior Yelp reviews. Hmm. They only make reservations for parties of 7 or more. Boo. And up until 5:30 pm. Boo again. Parking crazy. Boo. But when we walked in, wow, it's like a whole new place. We were seated immediately.  What?  Yelp reviews said otherwise.  Hey and it's Christmas week and a lobby with people.  And we got sat right away?! Impressive.  The Food ordering no problem and everything ordered tasted great despite some reviews. And, the coffee was right on. Being from Jersey, it's the first thing I order. Some habits are hard to break.

And For people with kids, this comes with the territory....In the ladies bathroom was a small young child happily singing randomly song after song - a serenade - of her own Christmas Concert and occasionally matching the Christmas Santa Clause Has Come to town Muzak songs emanating out of the loo's ceiling speakers. I left the loo singing myself. Santa had come to town. So let's give Santa and the Cheesecake Factory 4 stars. And the kid 5 for making a joyful noise.

Jeannie S.,"Austin, United States",0,46,,1.0,28/7/2017,"Searched long and hard for somewhere fun with good food to take our bday girl turning the big 13. She was so excited for her big day and the thing she looked forward to the most was not being handed a kids menu!! Had good memories of this place from Seattle. So... we get there and are immediately faced with a snarky rude cold hostess who didn't even look up and glance when I let her know we were celebrating our daughters 13th. Made my daughter feel really special... yep. In fact no one standing lifeless at the hostess counter even looked at us or cracked a smile. She then takes us to our table without a hint of a friendly gesture, throws 2 kids menus at our 13 and 10 year old (these are designed for 12 and under so ya- no clue here ; what a lame hostess)... literally tosses a heap of utensils right in the middle of the table and walks off. She walks back to bring a few napkins or something of the sort and I told her to remove the kids menu and bring our 13yo bday girl a GROWN UP MENU. She rolls her eyes and huffs off, obviously cursing under her breath and delivered said menu to our poor daughter. Had I the energy or the want to add additional stress to our special celebration I would have involved the manager.  However I decided to stay focused on our waitress who seemed interested in turning things around. (Meanwhile getting drive by evil eye by psycho hostess...) so, I pulled her to the side to kindly let her know about our bday girl and that I had brought #1 and #3 candles for her dessert. She happily asked to place them in her pocket until the reveal. I'm thinking things will turn around. Fast forward past an average overpriced dinner that didn't blow our socks off, here comes the long awaited lit cheesecake and cameras rolling as the bday song starts.... and we are totally let down as we noticed the #1 candle is a little stub completely broke off .. yes 1/4 of a #1 they had the nerve to stick into the cake sitting about an inch out of the cake looking totally stupid and the #3 fully intact which looked even more stupid. Then they act as if they don't notice!!  We are all staring at this stupid looking candle wondering what the heck happened! Ya think maybe someone could have had the decency or brains to bring this to my attention and just notify us that they could use other replacement candles (which yes I called ahead and made sure they do have basic candles for such events). So daughter leaves to the bathroom and I just had to ask the waitress what happened.   She looks embarrassed and puzzled in how to cover her tracks and proceeds to share with us about how it was in her pocket then got moved to a drawer than got moved to kitchen and something must've happened... ya just admit that someone broke it, apologize and let's get on with this lame horrible disaster of a night would ya??!!! OMG- NEVER GOING BACK. Just horrendous service.  Whoever you are managing this place and was there on the night of 7/26/17 at 5:45 PM, fire the hostess who would rather be smoking crack in the alley then graciously  serving customers and turning them into repeat customers. You know which one I'm talking about.

I'm finally writing this review, in part to remind myself not to make the mistake of returning again.   Extremely slow service (waiting over an hour for a simple order for 2 people), incorrect order fulfillments, and unresponsive corrections to the orders are all routine here.  In fact, I can only remember one time that I dined here uneventfully.  I am honestly not a picky person and rarely complain, so I can only imagine how more discriminating guests respond to their experiences which I doubt are any better than mine have been.  The take-out ordering has also been problematic nearly every time I've used it.  I'm not sure how a chain restaurant of this size can continue to operate with such poor performance.  I have to assume it's due to the proximity to a large hotel which must bring in unsuspecting visitors who don't realize the consistency of the terrible service, poor management, and overall poor experiences at this location.  I hate writing bad reviews, but since I've had plenty of bad experiences here, all of which cumulatively reflect a one-star rating, I feel obliged to share my opinion of this establishment to further the accuracy of Yelp.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=100

Well, our Christmas dinner eventually turned into my birthday dinner this year.  So like the menu, this place is MASSIVE.  It's like a bigger, nicer, more upscale Chili's.  The food though, the food is always superb.  The cheesecakes are also massive, the selection is way huge and they're also delicious.  Having worked in the hotel industry for most of my adult life, the food always reminds me of really well done banquet food.  I can go on and on about this place and it'll always come back to this, the food is tasty, the portions are huge and more than likely whatever you eat is gonna be really bad for you.  Really bad for you but usually, delicious food is.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=100

Amy D.,"Hutto, United States",11,16,4,1.0,8/2/2013,"Friday, February 1 Around 9 p.m. my family and I went to The Cheesecake Factory located in the Arboretum in celebration of my sister's birthday. I was excited not only because it was my sister's birthday (party of 16) but also it was my first time being at The Cheesecake Factory. It is a very nice place but after about 1.5 hours later we were finally seated. The food was pretty good. We left the restaurant around midnight and noticed several cop cars out front. We get to our truck only to find out we've been a victim of ""ATTEMPTED AUTO THEFT."" The thieves broke the lock to our truck and also jammed and damaged/broke our ignition switch. Our truck couldn't even start!! My family was stranded! I was in shock because this has never happened to us, not to mention we couldn't believe this actually happened in a ""nice"" part of town.   So here is my question: Where was the mobile security patrol? Hmmm good question! We filed a police report and were told by officer M. Heyward that 4 trucks (in addition to ours) were also broken into ....WOW UNBELIEVABLE!!   Result: So here is my little family, stranded with no option other than my husband calling a tow truck company from the town we live, which by the way is about 45 minutes away from Austin. I was in complete shock all weekend until Monday. I called Cheesecake Factory early Monday and spoke with manager Sherston to let them know what happened in their parking lot and felt someone should be liable for their customer's damaged property. Unfortunately, Sherston was quite insensitive and quickly referred me to Simon Properties. I called Simon Property early Tuesday only to be instructed to call back after 1 p.m.   Conclusion: When customers visit an establishment, they should have a reasonable sense of security that their belongings will be safe. If something is damaged, there is such thing called insurance....but I find even getting to this point is almost impossible... so far. 2 stars because the cheese cake is excellent !",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=220

Huge menu, massive incredibly caloric portions, usually good attentive staff and sometimes a huge wait to experience all the above. I always try to avoid chains but it's simply not possible while staying at the Arboretum area in Austin.  My beef with this place was not due to beef. No, it was around chicken. Specifically that I ordered a $7 pretzel chicken app. It never arrived and about 10 minutes later, an ashen-faced manager arrived, apologized, and told me the kitchen had ruined it and it was the last one they had. This, after telling me it's a ""scratch kitchen."" If that is the case, shouldn't they be able to re-create it using fresh ingredients? I chose another app, the crabcakes, which were middling at best and twice the price. So when the bill came and I'd been charged for the pricier app, out came the Yelp app. Two stars.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=180

I know a lot of people like the cheesecake, but I prefer a cheese cake that is baked, not set in the refrigerator... so their cheesecake always disappoints.

The first several times I went to this restaurant I was so impressed by their service that I told one of the servers, ""we never, ever get bad service when we come here."" He told us that the training for servers there was very stringent and they had extremely high standards for who they hired. I really thought it showed. But the last probably three or four times we've gone, we've had experiences that fall almost on the opposite end of the spectrum. It takes so long to get greeted by your server, get your drinks/bread, be asked for your order, etc. Then at the end of the meal, it's the norm to have your server ignore you, seemingly forget about you, and/or completely disappear. I can't stand going to restaurants where you have to wait forever for your check. It feels like they're holding me hostage long after I did what I came to do, which is eat food. Yes, I like sitting and visiting at a restaurant, but I would rather do it out of my own free will and not because the server forgot about me or doesn't care. It's really sad because it didn't used to be this way but something must have changed with their hiring process or training. Either that or they've gone the way of many other businesses and don't have enough people staffed at the right times.

Zafa R.,"Austin, United States",0,90,58,4.0,9/6/2010,"Date of First Visit: June 27, 2008 Some restaurants have a good, solid dependability. You go and know that whatever you will order will come out a certain way. Call it blandness, generic, whatever. We all have a hankering for these restaurants now and again. The Cheesecake Factory is such a restaurant. It is a very well-known national chain of restaurants. Well, it's more well known for its huge portions (and some might say, their cheesecakes) than for groundbreaking, nouveau cuisine. Although their portions are usually enough to feed a small army, they don't come cheap. I hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in about a year, so I decided to go check out the only one in town, which unfortunately means trekking to the Arboretum area. I wasn't very hungry and wanted something light, so I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps appetizer. There was definitely more than enough! My dining companion ordered the spicy and crispy chicken sandwich. We were both really satisfied with our meals, and ended by sharing the tiramisu (the actual cake, not the cheesecake). It definitely was a ""pick me up"" of a dessert! We went on a Friday night, so predictably, there was a wait, although it was bearable. As far as restaurants go, I don't think you can go wrong, as the Cheesecake Factory offers so many options on their menu that you're bound to find something you like. Again, my only caveat is that this is not cheap dining by any means. I have dined at other locations (mostly in Boston where I used to live) and tried the bar menu. All the appetizers are priced (and portioned) less. It's a great way to try all their appetizers without spending too much.

But one thing that i really feel about the place is that the food is mediocre. Paying for good food isn't a problem, I mean it was edible but theres no ""wow"" factor. For a place that prizes themselves so much i would think they would at least have better food than cheddars but i guess i'll continue the disappointment until someone else decides to have a event here.  All in all, its hard to avoid Cheesecake factory because of its name, and great cheesecake, but don't set high expectations it'll ruin the night.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=420
Caitlyn B.,"Austin, United States",180,26,5,5.0,10/3/2014,"I couldn't decide on a restaurant for my birthday. I needed a place that had lots of choices for all the palates in our large party. I settled on Cheesecake Factory, knowing there extremely large menu and building would satisfy both issues.  I became, at first, slightly concerned by the reviews that were all over the place for this location. Then I got annoyed. Most reviews were about decor (that you don't eat) and menu size (you have to be extremely difficult to complain about TOO many choices.) so I decided to give it a shot anyway, having had excellent experiences with other locations in San Diego and Vegas. Our meal was perfect. Our party of 10 and 2 infants was sat immediately despite the after church crows (which is quite busy here in the South.) Between food allergies and picky eaters, we were not an easy group and our server Alicia handled it with ease. She was extremely attentive, but not annoying. She was quick on drink refills and ensuring we had everything we needed. Everything came out perfectly as ordered. I had a delicious piece of chocolate truffle layer cake (since I am sadly dairy intolerant at a place that specializes in cheesecake?)

I am so glad I did, the skinnylicious menu is freaking AWESOME. Tons of choices, good prices, good portions, and delicious food that isn't going to be 4,000 calories for a meal. I've tried the lettuce tacos, the tuna tartare, the asian spicy chicken salad, the edamame, and a bunch of other things all the times I've gone with my friends. CCF has definitely become a place I like to go to.

Jon A.,"Austin, United States",0,5,,1.0,14/4/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorite places to go on special occasions, so it was especially disappointing to get such a terrible ""chicken"" burrito. In all fairness, I may have ticked somebody off by sending my order back initially; I'd asked for no cilantro, and it came smothered in cilantro.  But no big deal; mistakes happen; I was not upset at all.  Then, the burrito I did get was a flour tortilla with onion and tomato sauce inside.  There were 3 very small pieces of chicken hidden in all the unseasoned tomato sauce.  There were lots of red onion pieces, so I nibbled on those. I presume that whoever is in the kitchen knows that a chicken burrito is more than unseasoned tomato sauce in a flour tortilla, so my only conclusion is that I made somebody mad by asking for my food without cilantro.

The bill was right at $100.00 and I left the waiter a $20.00 tip after all it was not his fault. I was overcharged on the meal by having to pay for a higher food item.  I waited for a few days to calm down before going to see the manager Charlie Martindale.  I went to speak with Mr Martindale and gave him a letter of the events along with a copy of the bill.  He seemed concerned and said he would find out who the manager was and find out what had happened.  After not hearing anything for 2 weeks, I contacted Mr Martindale.  He said he thought that by us talking that everything was satisfactory.  Everyone can have a bad night and all I really wanted was an email, a note, or a call saying something like ""I am sorry that we did not live up to our usual quality of service that you have received in the past"".  I did not receive such a small sign of customer service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=280

Matt P.,"Austin, United States",35,88,46,2.0,17/4/2013,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory two times. The first, we had drinks and cheesecake to go. The second, we had drinks and apps. We sat at the bar both times. I had high expectations going both times due to all the hype Ive heard from friends and others. Both times we went, we had the same bartender, I believe Jackie is her name. She was attentive and fantastic both times we were there. Never a dry drink and quick with any requests we had. The cheesecake we had was ""Adams Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple"". Dont get me wrong, it was rich and very good, but when your namesake is such I expected life changing cheesecake, and thats not what I got. Our second trip we I wanted to try as many things as possible from the novel of a menu CF offers. We ordered small plates and apps that included the made to order guacamole, Parmesan Polenta Fries, Crispy Crab Bites, Dynamite Tempura Shrimp and Vietnamese Tacos. The guac was good and fresh, but I had to salt it 4 times before I felt like it was right. Guac is very simple, salt being one of the key ingredients. I thought it perplexing that there was little or none in ours, and at $10.95 I dont feel like a little salt is a lot to ask for. The parm polenta fries struck me as straight out of a frozen bag into a deep frier, nothing special here. The crispy crab bites had big chunks of crab in them which was nice, but they were slightly undercooked, pretty greasy and served with a side of what Im assuming was supposed to be tartar sauce. It was more like mayo with 4 peices of relish in it. The dynamite shrimp was a big let down. There was nothing dynamite about it. There was no heat anywhere in the dish and the flavors were pedestrian at best. The worst thing we had was the Vietnamese tacos. I had made it 3/4 of the way through the first one when I got to the part of the bun that was stale and hard as a rock. I didnt even attempt to eat the other two and asked to have it taken off the bill, which Jackie handled without hesitation. We took our leftovers to go, which promptly ended up in the trash as soon as we got home because I was not interested in eating any of it ever again. My model has always been to give a place two chances because anyone can have a bad day.

The three tacos were perfectly filled with the right amount of shrimp and other toppings. Additionally, the vegetables that are served on the side are great. They had just the right amount of flavor I thought. Between the service and the food, this location has more than warranted give stars.  I also spoke on the phone to Charlie (I believe that's his name) who was a manager that night. The service and food was simply too outstanding to not thank someone in management.

Ryan H.,"Cedar Park, United States",6,169,6,2.0,2/5/2013,"There is nothing inherently wrong with this place besides maybe the prices. Its just underwhelming. The prices are very high for what you are eating (typical appetizer in the $8-10 range and meals about $15 all the way up to $30 for a ribeye). The amount of stuff on the menu is overwhelming and leads me to believe they are mostly prepared from frozen food. Which leads to my other observation that many of the dishes are very salty. Obviously the cheesecake is great. It's what gets people in the door, and rightfully so. But beyond that, its a place that is expensive and specializes in nothing. Its probably good for a group of picky eaters because the menu is so large its hard to find something thats not on there.

As with all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants, the waiters/waitresses will wear white to show that they are hiding nothing. Any food stains can be easily seen I suppose, but here's the other catch. The lights are generally annoyingly dim, so even with a white uniform, I still wouldn't be able to see any food stains. Nevertheless, the servers are super friendly and make sure they get you what you want.  One of the complaints here is that the food is really expensive, but honestly I think it is a reasonable deal because Cheesecake Factory provides you with so much. If you can't afford it, then share the dish with one other person and split the check. If you're still hungry, you can munch on the complimentary bread and butter. And let's not forget to order dessert. The Cheesecake Factory makes so many different delicious, mouth-watering cheesecakes. I usually choose the fruity ones.

About five minutes later, the manager stops by our table and asks us how we were enjoying everything. We told him how bad our service was and expected an apology or something to let us know he cared. He said he was going to check on our food and sure enough, it came right out, but we never saw the manager again. He never came back to check on us, to apologize, to rectify the situation, nothing.

Blue cheese olives, I die! I mean, sure, they're not the only place to have blue cheese olives, but they have EVERYTHING and it is all SO GOOD! I've always had good to great service, quick seating (although I go during weekday lunch), and I've yet to have a cheesecake that is anything less than fantastic. I love the tiramisu, the anniversary, the banana cream, and the dutch apple something or other. So.freaking.good. ALAS it's a cheesy chain, so I try to keep my love mostly secret, but here I am, outing myself to the whole Internet. Busted!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=240

Vicki G.,"Austin, United States",375,265,1,2.0,29/11/2012,"So much has been written about the Cheesecake Factory that I hesitate... but Yelping  is my duty, and an honor and a privilege. So here I go. If you've been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know that it's overwhelming -- the faux fancy decor that reminds me of Vegas, the book-like menus (why are there ads in their menus? tacky!), the enormous portions. We just don't eat vast quantities of food, preferring quality to quantity. So, for lunch we split three ""small plates"": crab bites,  dynamite shrimp, kale salad.  Crab bites: surprisingly tasty, with real crab in evidence. Sauce: what was that, mayonnaise? Very little flavor and definitely did not enhance the crab cakes. Dynamite shrimp: tempura shrimp served with a ""dynamite"" sauce. Folks, what does ""dynamite"" indicate to you when you read it on a menu? Spicy, am I right? No spice here. Merely a different color of mayonnaise. Very little taste. Shrimp themselves were okay, but tempura batter absorbed a lot of grease (fried at too low a temperature?). Kale salad: disappointing. The apple had a floral overtone, and the creamy dressing overpowered the ingredients. Frankly, the kale salads at both Central Market and Whole Foods outshine this one by a long shot. He insisted on dessert, and ordered carrot cake. (I know -- it's the CHEESECAKE factory.) But the carrot cake was quite good. $7.50 a slice -- it should be good! It was large, but...  In conclusion, I would return, but really, it's just not the type of restaurant that works well for me.  Dessert may be their strong suit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=240

Yet The Factory proves capable of being generally okay and serving up random surprises... Service was surprisingly good throughout the evening. The fried macaroni and cheese appetizer was comfort food on steroids. Drinks were sound. When the entrees arrived, my meatloaf dish just passed comfort food muster, as did the chicken-and-biscuits. It was the girlfriend's Cuban sandwich that really stole the show: I hesitate to confess it, but it was the best Cuban sandwich I've ever tasted.

In fact I'd say if you took a grand hotel restaurant and made it larger and had itself cheesecake you would get precisely the Cheesecake Factory if you like that that's great I do.  Place is very clean staff is very friendly and attractive. But they are a little bit disorganized. I called for a pick up order and it took 30 minutes and it was only a burger and I was on hold for about 8 minutes. It wasn't a busy time it was 11 o'clock in the morning. I was a little surprised. There's a lady named  Kasey.

I went here for prom several years ago and it wasn't good enough to remember. I wasn't expecting much. This restaurant is beautiful. We were immediatly seated and handed a HUGE menu that took me forever to look through. I decided on the Memphis burger, which is a hamburger with swiss cheese, pulled pork, coleslaw, and pickles. This was the best burger I've ever tried! My only problem was that I asked for medium well and was given medium rare. It was still good though. I think my boyfriend had Chicken Pascotta, he said it was good and ate everything but thats doesn't say much since he always does.  Last, we ordered the Rasberry Lemon Cheesecake. I'm not a fan of cheesecak but figured since we're at the Cheesecake Factory we should try it. The cheesecake is sooo good! Its huge too so enough to share and fairly priced.

We came in here also cause I had a gift card that i purchased a while back and a free offer for cheesecake. i thought why not have a lovely mid day lunch here.What I did not enjoy was our meal at the end of it all.The waiter took to long to attend us and bring us our waters,bread,order our food, cheesecake and check(note different waitress brought our food in the end). When we told him why everything was taking so long for our waters and bread, all he said was it was busy on a Sunday.He rubbed off the wrong way, the way he talked and expressed himself,almost as if he did not like attending us. After we waited about 20 minutes between the waters and bread , we were already thinking of leaving. I do not appreciate waiting that long for something so simple. He then took another 15-20 minutes to take our order. After we ate we waited yet another period of time waiting to take our plates and bring us a dessert menu. I mentioned the free cheesecake offer when we received our waters/bread. By this time I just wanted my cheesecake and be done. By the time we finished it no more than 10 minutes cause we took most of the cheesecake home. He had us sit there for another 15 minutes while he was passed by the hall not noticing that our plates were to the slide and we were waiting for the check. Ultimately I flagged him down for the check. He then said that my gift card and cheesecake took too long to process since they were tricky, what is so tricky about that?!  When we were ready to pay he brought the wrong check and took another 10 minutes to bring the right check out.

I say that to say this:  I have to give it 5 stars based off of a singular experience I had there the other night.   I didn't choose to go... it was a friend's birthday and she wanted to go... In total, she suckered 8 people to go there on her birthday. The food was the usual oversized portions of junk, the cheesecake was cheesecake, the service is always spot on... But then THERE WAS A COCKROACH CRAWLING ON ONE OF OUR PARTY-GOER'S BACKS! She stood up and screamed... then half the table screamed... then her baby started crying.   We called the manager over who, after just 2-3 minutes of decent apology and no haggling... comped our entire meal... that's 8 people to the tune of about $200.

Ryan B.,"Austin, United States",242,190,169,1.0,4/1/2014,"Shockingly bad customer service experience. Disappointing visit after visiting this location multiple times. The Cheesecake Factory has a great selection of cakes as you walk in. I've always ordered a slice or two on my way out. This night, however, featured some of the clumsiest and worst customer service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. It was a birthday dinner for a friend of ours. A cheesecake was purchased up front as we waited to be seated. The wait time was only a little over 30 minutes on a Friday for a large group. Not bad. That was the end of the good experience. The menu is overbearing, the servers have no idea what is available and what isn't available. You finally make a selection only to have the waiter come back ten minutes later and tell you there is no pizza dough. That is the most frustrating feeling when you are hungry. I tried to order a couple of margaritas while we waited. The waiter suggested I try some of the famous cocktails instead. He talked me into them, so we ordered two. Five minutes pass, no cocktails. Ten minutes... We ask him where the cocktails are? He looks up into the ceiling for a second as if he is in deep thought... Oh he forgot to key them into the system and they were never ordered. Wow what a disaster of a visit this is. Our food has already arrived, no drinks and a confused service attendant. We ended up declining to have the drinks ordered at this point. Why give them the money? We had mentioned at the beginning that it was someone's birthday at our table. The other tables around us got birthday songs and normal treatment. This waiter spaces, didn't say a word to our birthday patron and then managed to forget to bring out the cake twice. When he did finally bring out the cake, he kind of looked at us not saying a word.. then realized he had brought no plates or silverware for us to consume the cake with. As he reached over the cake to pickup our old plates, he almost made contact with the cake with his shirt several times. He then proceeded to bring out two boxes that didn't fit the cake. I've never seen someone so lost in space or on another planet in my life. Save yourself the trouble people.

Samantha S.,"Edinburg, United States",9,11,3,2.0,1/8/2015,"I'm not from Austin and I haven't been to the Cheese Cake Factory since I was little. The restaurant is beautiful. It was super busy. The hostesses were very nice. They told my friend and I it was going to be a 15 min wait. It took about 10 mins.. the hostess took us to a table that was already sat and apologized and took us to another table. Which was completely understandable. Ok. So our server. He meant well that's all I'm gonna say. He took our alcohol drinks without carding us. I'm 24. I pulled out my ID he said that was fine. My friend asked for an unsweet tea that she didn't get until after the meal was brought because we asked a Different server that brought out our meal if she'd get us one. She ordered an appetizer that we had to remind him we wanted and he obviously didn't ring it in until after the meal. I told him I had never been there and the menu all looked awesome. I ordered something that  but modified it. He got 1 of the modifications right. He never touched the table again. I had to wave him down for a box. Again, for our check. But what pissed me off the most was that he kept using the word ""f***"" with us like he was talking to his buddies and still charged for the appetizer. If I everrr go back there I would request NOT to have that server. The food was delicious. That's probably the only reason why I'd ever go back.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=200
Vincent F.,"Houston, United States",0,2,,1.0,12/10/2015,"I've eaten at several cheesecake factories, and the service has usually varied between excellent to adequate. Even when the service was so-so, once informed, the manager was willing to make it right. Not at this one. The food took over an hour, two of the plates were cold, and the drinks had to be frequently requested. These things happen, but once I told the manager that our experience was bad, she made vague assertions as to doing something and then did nothing.

Unfortunately, the meals, (mainly) ho-hum service and  general experience did not match the grand decor of the place.  We came in for lunch today and were seated right away which was a plus. Our waiter came by a few minutes later and took our drink order. In true CcF fashion, it took us about 15-20 minutes to pour over the exhaustingly huge menu. Our waiter came back and took our order - we had: 2 Pizza/Salad Lunch Specials 1 Wild Mushroom Bread 1 Order of Sliders 1 Order TexMex Eggrolls Everything came out fairly quickly and the food was alright. So, what was my big problem here? For some reason, our waiter had memory problems, and unfortunately they were directed towards one particular person in our party. This person initially ordered coffee. When he was done with his coffee the waiter came over and asked him if he wanted a refill, and he said, ""No, but I think I'll switch to Coke."" We waited for that Coke... the waiter even came back and refilled everyone else's drinks without bringing that Coke or re-asking the person if they wanted anything else to drink. So, someone had an extra water, and they gave it to that person... but there was no straw. The same guy asks the waiter for a straw...and we wait for the straw...and wait. His girlfriend finally had to ask a second time for a straw. It was just a little wtf, that's all.  Anyways... I'd give this place 3 stars for A-Ok because..ehh it was anything special, but it was alright...but the service needs to improve before I add that third star.

The Cheesecake Factory was my favorite restaurant ever but I doubt I'll return to this location. I would rather drive an hour to San Antonio than return to the Austin location restaurant. First off, the hostesses let people cut in line to get our names on the waiting list. And Don't even acknowledge the mistake. We finally get called for our table and what do you know?, the table wasn't ready. Smh. We end up waiting in the middle of walking isle, in the way because the hostesses couldn't plan accordingly for tables that were or weren't clean. And of course more people that came in after us keep getting seated while we are still waiting. Now, our waitress....gosh, was she high?! We ordered a key lime cheesecake. She comes back repeats ""so you wanted the Godiva cheesecake?"" We told her no, the Key lime cheesecake. We think she's got it. She packs it, we pay and leave.

Jim L.,"Austin, United States",275,514,83,2.0,6/2/2010,"Not my choice to eat at a chain for lunch. I have always like the concept of the Cheesecake factory from a visual perspective - great looking place. From a portion control perspective I was looking around, making sure Richard Simmons was not going to come queening out in his striped shorts yelling ""Potion Control! Portion Control!"" when the waiter dropped the food order. My friends split a very underwhelming pepperoni pizza - I was surprised and concerned that between the two of them they ate a quarter of the thing. One other friend ordered a club, but he could not get his mouth around it because it was so big. My turkey burger was good, but I ordered a side salad instead of fries due to the size of things around here.  Therefore, if you are concerned about calorie intake at each meal, ease up on the cheesecake factory by splitting plates or ordering salads without dressing (sugar!). Even better, try another restaurant that caters to your concern for your figure. If you are not concerned about your hourglass (or barrel, as it were), eat up!  I will say that low carb, low sugar Splenda cheesecake sounds like poo, but one of our guests did order it, and it was really no different than the regular in terms of flavor. It felt a bit lighter, and I would still split it, but I was surprised at how good it was.

Sarah M.,"Austin, United States",125,426,641,3.0,1/2/2007,"This particular version of the American favorite is housed in a high-ceilinged corner of the Arboretum in North Austin. Serving up their typical smorgasbord of over-sized omelettes and sugary slices, it's a sure bet for every type of eater. Cheesecake Factory is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of place, but our local version has a few perks. For one, it's always packed (bustling atmosphere) but there's ample seating (no suffering for bustling atmosphere). Two, the aforementioned diversity of cuisine. Three, a great place for a group outing when you have varying incomes. Four, the cheesecake is great. C'mon. Admit it. It's really good. Cheesecake Factory is comparable in price to a lot of homegrown Austin restaurants and it's pretty far north for many residents.

I ordered the app, another waiter brought us our food, and refills on drinks. Our app took about 10 minutes, and after about 5-10 mins of eating our app, the waitress comes to our table and says, "" Let me get this app out your way"" and starts to walk away again. I shouted at her and said we were ready to order. Wow. She takes the order, the food comes out by yet another waiter, and we eat. At the end, she doesn't offer dessert, and so we asked for a dessert menu, because after all, this is cheesecake factory, and we had told the waitress it was a special day.

Too Cool For School G.,"Austin, United States",10,28,10,1.0,6/8/2011,"BULLET POINTS:  - Far too expensive considering their now only-okay food  - Snotty and frigid morons on staff, almost exclusively  - WONDERFUL tropical iced tea (if they still have it)  - Excellent (if vastly overpriced) cheesecake  - NOT WORTH THE COST OR THE WAIT Flashback to 2005.  I was newly transplanted to our first apartment in Austin, hubby's lifetime home minus his stint in the Air Force.  While looking for a nice place to celebrate our move, we came upon the Cheesecake Factory.  We went in with our two children, and proceeded to have the most expensive meal we had ever eaten in our married lives.  But it was worth every single PENNY!  The food was incredible, the tea was amazing, and the service was exceptional.  And that was then. Flash forward to 2007, the last time I set foot inside what I have come to refer to as the Asshole Factory.  I had just gotten off of work, and our tax refund had come in that afternoon.  Naturally, we were all very hungry and looking to enjoy a great meal as a family.  We met up with my sister in law there at 4:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, and were greeted by a surprisingly large crowd of folks waiting to be seated.  We were told that the wait for a table would be about 30 minutes, which we deemed acceptable.  So we sat down.  And as we sat, the crowd around us dwindled slowly.  Then, folks started showing up who were arriving more than 20 minutes after us.  Guess who got seated right away without a reservation?  EVERYONE who arrived after we did!  Since our 30-minute wait had elapsed, we went back to question the frigid bitch of a hostess who had quoted us that wait time.  She said that it was getting to be peak time, and was probably going to be over 20 more minutes.  (In spite of the fact that the assholes who got there less than 5 minutes ago, with parties the same size as or larger than ours, were being seated ahead of us?  Yeah.)  We had waited for an hour when I finally got super pissed off and demanded to see the manager.  The manager said that we should have made a reservation when showing up at peak times.  When I informed him that peak times didn't include 4:30 in the afternoon, he got that snooty ""I think I would know"" look on his face and pretty much dismissed us entirely.  (At least, that was the vibe I got from his turning around and walking away before I was finished talking to his sorry ass.)  I turned to hubby and told him that we were leaving.  Made sure the hostess was watching as I smashed that stupid pager to shreds and tossed it in the garbage.  Went across the parking lot to Serrano's and had a much more palatable meal in less time than we had waited to be seated at the Asshole Factory.  Don't waste your time...they wouldn't know customer service if it kicked them in their holier-than-thou asses.  (And oh, how I wish it would!!!!)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=400

Kimberly K.,"Austin, United States",498,277,51,4.0,16/8/2008,"Seven months pregnant and craving artichoke dip, my friend said the health of her child depended on her eating this specific dip within the hour. Pregnant women can be dramatically urgent for good reason. Heavy with impending child, she ate all but one bite of the large spinach artichoke dip and then wolfed down the Chicken Marsala.  The one bite of the dip that I was able to try was excellent - great proportions of creamy and salty.  Her chicken was tender with a hint of sweet wine. When I had first heard of this restaurant, I thought they only sold cheesecake. That is simply a serious head fake.  CHEESEFAKE. Follow the belly, not the head...with over 200 items on the menu, follow the belly, cuz it will soon be FULL...I am usually full long before the time dessert is ordered.  Their tag line is, ""Something for everyone."" Indeed.  And by ""everyone"" they mean all of humanity.  Many vegetarian items.  I nominate the Factory as the greatest place for a gathering with people who cannot agree where to go... people who do not demand fine dining and who enjoy leftovers. The Asian Steak Salad was my favorite meal but it seems that has been discontinued. On this particular day, I was the recipient of a healthy plate of comforting Meatloaf and mashed potatoes - three large slices of loafed meat that were prepared in a very traditional manner. Meatloaf by nature is kind of a dull meal... and this version did not disappoint. The mashed potatoes were white and buttery. My friend chose the right place for her craving.  She was eating for two.  Not long after this dinner, she prematurely gave birth to a beautiful girl.

We gave the place one last shot last month, the service was so horrible we went ahead and left before ordering our meals. Calls to management have seemingly fallen on deaf ears, they just didn't care about our business I guess. Several times I have been brought undercooked chicken, and once I had to return my bolognese pasta due to a sand-like crunchiness that was due to some error the management explained to me, although I've forgotten the reason. Funny thing was when I had mentioned the texture the response of my waiter and the staff was dubious and even patronizing until I made them taste it. Like I would complain for the fun of it. The carabonara pasta is too dry, the meatloaf doesn't taste like meatloaf per say, and while I love some lemon raspberry cream cheesecake, I don't feel it's worth $9 a slice.

The menu appears like a Greek diner menu (pages and pages) till you realize half of it is advertisements. That said they have a huge menu, and I'm told some items are better than others.  The atmosphere is a bit odd. Low lighting the floods every corner of the room and high ceilings with weird faux architecture. The light is supposed to be intimate and romantic I suppose, but it just makes it hard to see in a weird dusky sort of way.  I had a spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce. Very nice cuts of chicken and good lettuce, but beyond that the sandwich was just so so. The fries that came with it were laughable, but the waitress did warn me about that.  At my companions urging I tried the avocado egg rolls. I'm a fan of fusion but abhor fusion-for-fusion's-sake things, and this reeked of it. Luckily I was pleasantly surprised. The filling had great flavor and the wrappers were chewy and tasty. The tamarind/cumino sauce with them was quite nice too!  Lastly the cheese cake, for which the place takes it's name, was pretty mediocre. Nice presentation, but too stretchy. I prefer creamy to the cheesiness. It wasn't bad, but not revolutionary, and nothing to make me want to come back just for this, their ""specialty.""

Well my uncle was real old Austin. Sometimes he called it Waterloo out of force of habit. He worked in the factory in its heyday. You see the Colorado river (Townlake/Ladybird Lake for the kids) has changed course significantly since before the dams were put in place. The river used to flow as the very site of the factory. The creamcheese was barreled in Philadelphia and floated down river to Austin where it was processed before going to port in Galveston for export to Europe. My uncle rarely got to eat his own cheesecake, it was too precious. The money for one cheesecake in Europe would feed the family for a couple months. Well times have changed. We don't rely on the river to bring the raw cheese. But the building is in the same location, though obviously has been updated quite a bit.

It was thick, like Texas toast thick, and the crust was too hard to bite. The bacon was burnt on one end, undone on the other, and just right in the middle. There was supposed to be mayo on it, but the sandwich was really bland. I finally opened the bread and found some mayo on one end, but none in the middle, so I asked the waiter for some. They didn't ask why I needed it. So-So meal, except the last time I had brioche, it was in a tasty roll with holes in it it--like light and chewy--from Wal-Mart and much better than here.

The friendly but untrained waiter served us the expensive one. A few minutes later while serving the first two of the four entrees, the waiter nonchalantly said to one of our friends, ""I'm sorry. We're out of the sushi."" No kidding! That was our friend's entree choice ... not an appetizer. He had to wait another 20 minutes for his entree which was served as the other three were perusing the cheesecake menu. The icing on the cake was our cheesecake order ... which was why we went there in the first place. My wife and I selected two choices in case they were out of our first choice. ""Do you have these two?"" we asked the waiter. He seemed a bit insulted, ""Of course we do. We ALWAYS have every cheesecake on the menu."" He returned 10 minutes later and said sheepishly, ""Uh. We're out of your two choices. What's your next choice?"" What a joke! We did select another cheesecake, which was tasty but pricey.

It was a Tuesday so it was fairly slow at 5:00 but still very loud and it didn't help that although the place was close to empty we were seated close enough to look into the kitchen and across from the servers station. The call-outs on the overhead in the kitchen were disturbing enough but the constant clatter next to us was the ""icing"" on the cheesecake. I ordered a pomegranate mojito which was OK - a little too sweet, but OK. My friends were just drinking wine and beer so no real challenges there. The next obstacle is the bound book that they call a menu. Finally after reaching a decision - comes to find out that I couldn't order it the way I wanted so I opted for the eggplant sandwich and Caesar salad. The plate came heaped with lettuce heavily coated in dressing. It was so over powering I couldn't eat more than 2 bites... The sandwich was cold. The bun was way too big for the tiny 3 pieces of eggplant that was on it. There was actually more grill red onion than eggplant on the roll. (which I had also asked to be left off - why get it if you don't want to eat it?). I proceeded to eat the cheese and lack of other veggies on this $12 plate. The waiter came to clear the table and commented that it looks like I didn't like my food - I didn't. I commented on the salad and he said - yeah, I know.... What? Really?... to add more insult to the day, my friends ""insisted"" I ordered cheesecake for my birthday - after all it is the Cheesecake Factory.

What is somewhat spiffy about the Cheesecake Factory: -They're always very accomodating of large groups.  I typically head in here with groups of around 20 or so for birthdays, bachleorette parties, etc.  Rarely do I come in here with one other person or even just my family. -There's something on the menu for everyone- and I mean everyone.... UNLESS you're on a diet (even the salads have ridiculous amounts of cals in them). -The food isn't half bad and you'll definitely end up taking some home with you.  The appetizers are generous for your party and they also have complementary bread for your table. What isn't so spiffy: -The service is kind of iffy.  Some days you might get good service, others not so much.  For every 2 good servers I've encountered, I've had at least 1 bad one.  One time especially is etched in my brain where I went with just one other person one Sunday evening and we were put in an area all by ourselves and it almost seemed at times that our waiter completely forgot us since there were no other people around.  When he'd come over, it'd seem like a big deal to him that we kind of lost our appetite and just wanted to leave pronto.  I've also had instances in larger groups where the waiters kind of disappear for a while and we have to flag some other waiter down to bring more bread/get a refill/get a menu for a late party, whatever. -The wait time.  Unless you have some kind of reservation, you can expect to wait anywhere from 15 minutes to over an hour.  What's nice, though, is that if you're there solely for the cheesecake, you can grab a slice and head out at their little cheesecake case. -The menu can be absolutely daunting for the unprepared- and in a large group, there's always somebody who has no idea what they want.  At 200+ menu items, it just makes things that much harder for that person to figure out. -I guess it is just a personal peeve of mine, but I don't like that they box up your leftovers for you.  Maybe that's just a fancy thing and I'm crazy, but I'm just not a fan of having someone else box up my plate. So overall, the Cheesecake Factory seems much more about the experience itself than the quality of the food- which is all right.  If I had to recommend something, I'd say the calimari and the orange chicken are pretty good.  You'll pay a premium, but you will get a lot of food for the deal.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=340

Can't go wrong with the standard original cheesecake topped with strawberries. Peanut butter one is pretty good too. Turtle chocolate one is a bit too chocolaty but others may love it. Overall, it's pretty good to go every now and then.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-austin?start=340

We then had to send it back and with an embarrassed look the manager had to apologize yet again. The waiter was slow and did not even ask if we needed anything, we had to waive him down to get what we needed.

This is higher-end tourist food. Better than TGIF but not by a huge margin. Their portions are colossal. Really, their ""lunch portion"" salads have to be tossed in 55 gallon drums. If the salad is 1800 calories, what do you think the pasta dish weighs in at??? It will take you 15 minutes, minimum, to wade through the tome of a menu and find something you think they cant possibly over-under cook / screw up.  They do make a mean cheesecake and a lot of different flavors. If you want a cool birthday cake for someone, get them something from here. Who doesn't love cheesecake?

The food and drink are mediocre at best.  They mask this by serving gorilla sized portions of everything.

Usually, it's the kind of place where a group I know is going, and I happen to be invited.  There's just something uneasy about seeing that gigantic menu that they have, ranging from Asian-inspired orange chicken, to UK's Shepherds Pie, to Filet Miñon, it's not possible for a restaurant to specializing on ALL those things. Also, who thinks it's a good idea to advertise designer men's jeans in a menu of fried, sugar-fueled, gigantic meals? It just feels way too disney. When I was in Highschool, I dug the ambience. Now I find it a bit gaudy. Why the cheesecake factory looks like an Egyptian palace I have no idea. But that, plus the size of the place, make it seem even more ridiculous.  The food is mediocre, they seem to go for the quantity over quality. My Shepherds Pie was Gigantic, but tasted light ground up hamburger with a mashed potato slop on top. It kind of missed that...flavor...that more authentic pies have. I'd assume that most of their dished are frozen in order to be able to prepare them in time, but I'm not sure. It's kind of expensive for the quality too. Prepare to Spending $15-$20 a person, which might not be that much, but there are better options out there.

So I went to Cheesecake Factory on Friday afternoon with my 8-year old for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up afer the Children's Museum. She is ga-ga for cheesecake, so where else? I was prepared to watch her indulge while I soothed my fractured nerves with a nice pot of Earl Grey, and then the waitress informed me they were out of hot tea. ""What!"" I joked (really, I was smiing). ""How can you be out of hot tea?"" She replies, straight-faced and emotionless, ""We're out of hot tea bags. Would you like hot water with lemon?"" Uh no, actually, I wouldn't. We ordered forgettable food and it was delivered with decent service-with-a-smile, but the occasion was ruined.  Running out of tea isn't a crime, but great businesses develop fanatically-loyal devotees through creative problem solving. If they were out of ketchup, what would they do? Run to HEB. If they were out of, gasp, coffee, what would they do? Place a frantic call to Sysco. But when they're out of hot tea, it's acceptable to simply inform the customer that they can't have the one thing they came in for? I think not.  We'll be cheesecaking at Chez Zee next time...

I've always been a sucker for anything that includes chicken, cheese, tomato sauce and pasta and this plate blends all of those items together in one gigantic plate. I always end up turning it into two meals and enjoy it every bit as much the next day as leftovers.

I was ill the first time so I don't remember what I ate even though it was only three small bites. It was the flu and not food poisening. So BF and I get seated immediately in the bar. We were told we couldn't have a table as they are reserved for a party of Teachers. Okay, so we sit at one of the Hightop tables. Not my favorites as I can't stand having my feet dangle and not touch the floor. This is a short person phoebia.  The party next to us had two Hi-Tops together and kept ordering different Appys. BF and I looked at their Appys to see what looked good. Our waitress comes over and introduces herself. Her name is Melissa, and she pronounces it ME - lis-sa and not Mel-lisa. Okay, to each his own.  BF gets his normal margarita and I try the JW Pink Lemonaide (Thanks to Cat T.) I enjoyed my drink but they did put a lot of ice in it. It was tangy and the raspberry flavor was promanate. The appetitizers we ordered arrived. It filled our Hi-Top. The Fried calamari was front and center, the Chicken Pot stickers in the back and the Crispy Crab Wontons right in front of me. So, of course, I dive into the Crab wontons. Be careful, these bad boys are HOT, I mean temperature HOT. Burnt my damm mouth on the cheese. More cautiously, I take a second bit. Creamy, the crab can be tasted, dipping sauce was sweet and spicy. Not bad at all. Onward to the calamari, and was very pleasantly surprised. They tasted good. They must have seasoned the batter as you didn't really need the tartar or cocktail sauces. Finally the pot stickers, interesting. It was like a small chicken meatball inside of dough. The filling was seasoned ground chicken and it was full of flavor but I loved the soy and ginger sauce with it.  Of course we didn't finish so the To-Go containers are requested. BF said the calamari would be good as leftovers. He was only half right. They still tasted good but also became chewy.  Oh, I forgot to mention, they serve you a free bread basket with some french bread and a dark whole grain bread.  At this point we are stuffed but I remember Errol M. writing about a piece of Heaven on Earth. I talk BF into ordering a Chocolate Truffle cake to go.
