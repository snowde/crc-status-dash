KyoungWhan K.,"Germantown, MD",0,9,,4.0,3/26/2016,"I went here three times for meal and once for cheese cake. Foods as well as cheese cakes are definitely awesome, but have ups and downs a little bit. The employees are friendly and provide good service. One thing that you have to keep in mind is that you need to be patient at peak time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=160
Mel W.,"Bowie, MD",1,6,2,1.0,8/10/2016,"This is by far the worst Cheesecake Factory in the DMV, I usually go to the one in Chevy Chase MD and Annapolis MD. This one had bad service and food. My nieces ordered Mac and cheese from the kids menu and it looked and tasted like it was thrown together in a last minute attempt, it has a milky soup like flavorless sauce which was lacking cheese. My nieces couldn't believe it, they are 10 and 6. They reordered chicken stripes with fries, strips were just ok, the fries were all cold and dry. I ordered a specialty salad it appeared to be a week old, veggies had brown spots and it was wilted. I reordered the grilled salmon with white rice and sautéed spinich. How difficult is it to prepare this, the salmon was cold, the rice was cold and hard, the spinich was half raw and it was all flavorless. We were there for almost 2 hours mostly waiting. My recommendation, don't do it, such a disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=160
Philip G.,"Tamaqua, PA",11,49,2,2.0,2/24/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great choice for groups because of the diversity of the menu, but as a chain it has lost a measurable amount of food quality over the last decade and this location is going down faster than most. The wait is longer than they quote when you check in, the service is generally slow and usually includes at least one mistake, the food quality at best is average and when we left Sunday night, a rat ran out of the building along with us. Lots of choices in Baltimore, skip this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=160
Renee S.,"San Francisco, CA",34,24,50,2.0,7/23/2014,"If you are out late and looking for something to put your belly it's okay. If you looking to satisfy your taste buds, keep on walking.  My family and I came here because it was open till late. It was convenient but after this experience, I think there may be better options. Our waitress was playing a weird game of hide and seek with us. And we ended up flagging down different people whenever we wanted to order something. I guess she was hiding from the kitchen staff too because when she finally appeared with the bread it was stone cold. Same goes for our entrées. We got our steak then sides of fries and asparagus followed 20 minutes later.  As for quality, my Cajun chicken pastas was bland and came out black in color. Even the cheese cake was just meh. Maybe we will come back for the Fourth of July to watch the fireworks here but I don't think will be ordering more than drinks and appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=160
Benee D.,"Glenn Dale, MD",49,5,1,1.0,9/14/2016,"My family and I went for brunch August 28th. The service was incredibly slow so I nicely asked if our waiter could receive some additional help since it was 13 people.  The manager approached me and stated the reasoning for slow service was my party didn't arrive at the same time. I went on to explain we had all been there for 45 minutes and hadn't received anything to drink.  He made the exact same statement and walked away. After an additional 20 minutes our order was taken. A full hour passed after our order was taken and still no drinks. Finally a waitress walked out with food and our waiter (who was serving drinks and food to another party that arrived well after us) told her not to serve the food. I was confused and surprised.  I then requested a  replacement waiter for my party because it was rude to stop food from being served after the long wait. The manager came to speak to me and refuse to give me anyone else. He kept saying the food would take a while and that it was our fault. So I attempted to redirect him by pointing out drinks had not been received after over an hour. The manager then admitted he checked the arrival time vs when our food was put in and confirmed it was over an hour. My husband asked the manager if he thought that was an acceptable level of service. The manager said no but still surprisingly blamed us for not arriving together. He became very upset place his hands in my face in a sort of back off me motion. I could not rationalize the reasoning for his tone and attitude, we were upset but never aggressive. So I took a step back anyway and suggested he go if he wasn't going to be of any service or resolve to the problem. The manager then yelled ""No you Go!""  which we did. I am still unsure as to how this escalated or why he took this tone to what is a very common service problem at a restaurant. I would suggest some additional training in customer service. I wish I had taken a picture of us leaving almost 2 hrs later with no drinks on the table. That would have been priceless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=160

It's always busy, and crowded. The food is never bad, but never that special either. Service for my big group is never tops. This location can have better service in the busy summer months.

Mo A.,"Washington, DC",3757,414,2038,3.0,7/23/2012,"I'm generally a harsh critic when it comes to chains.  There's a lack of consistency with the food, ridiculous wait times, inflated prices and poor service.  Generally speaking, Cheesecake Factory can fit that description at different points.  Once in a while though, they can get things right.  This was one of those times! This Cheesecake Factory location is at the Inner Harbor section of Baltimore, overlooking the water.  From a physical standpoint, the restaurant is not a stand alone location but actually is in a small mall of sorts that's in the middle of the Harbor scene.  The mall itself is basically a tourist trap with a couple of restaurants and stores that sells refreshments as well as memorabilia.   Came to this location after the speedboat disaster.  My date emerged from the boat looking fairly presentable....minus a few hairpins and one set of eye lashes.  Nothing that dim lighting can't fix! We entered the restaurant and were given a wait time of 15-20 minutes.  As you would expect, there were several tourists packing the place.  So what do you do when you're stuck in a packed lobby with a date who has more detachable parts than a Mrs. Potato Head toy?  Start looking at the cheesecake display cases!!  So many flavors looking oh so good! We were finally seated and started putting in our orders.  Since we had lunch not too long ago, drinks and desserts were on the agenda.  It was also the safe choice because let's face it, cheesecake is the only thing this chain does consistently well.  Our waitress was friendly and fairly prompt as she took our orders and served us during our stay. I ordered the raspberry lemonade, which was amazing.  Very tart with a hint of sweetness from the sugary rim of the glass.  I think I had 4-5 glasses.  I don't know if I was being drugged but that stuff was like liquid crack.  The waitress did quip about putting me on restriction after my 3rd cup but one look at my dilated pupils and she made like a good dealer and kept the ""stuff"" coming.   We ordered the hershey and red velvet cheesecakes.  Very generous portions means happy days in my world!!  The red velvet was nice to look at and tasted good.  I'm not the biggest red velvet fan because it's more savory than sweet but that's just a preference.  The Hersey on the other hand is likely to be banned by the American Diabetes Association.  Chocolate upon chocolate upon chocolate.  It was really good but honestly, it might have been too much chocolate....gasp....if there is such a thing.   Like any other tourist trap, it felt like the prices were a little inflated but either way, it's not a bad option in a high volume sight seeing location where many of the other choices specialize in highway robbery!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=160
Crystal H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",2,7,,2.0,1/7/2016,I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory restaurants  and this one was not to my likings I ordered a shot of Hennessy and the waitress didn't even remember until I mentioned it to her by then I had cancelled the shot only because I waited to long for her to bring it to me.

Nathan S.,"Fairborn, OH",0,10,4,5.0,7/14/2014,"My favorite place for dinner on the Harbor! I've been 3-4 times for dinner over the past week as it is very close to where I'm staying. The prices are fair for the area, but the 3 things that really set this place apart are... 1) the Service - you may have a short wait during busy times, but it's definitely worth it!  All 3 servers I've had were friendly, professional, and responsive. Even had a manager walking by offer to refill my drink. 2) the Food - all 3 dinner dishes have been served hot, fresh, and delicious! I've found the entrees to be very flavorful.  3) the Desserts - it deserves it's own recognition.

Tim W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2562,527,597,5.0,7/20/2010,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory in B'more.  I especially like this location because when there is a wait you can walk around in the harbor. The pagers work pretty far. The portions are large enough to share. The food is always good and hot and there's something for everyone.  Some of my favorite appetizers are the Roadside Sliders, Southern Fried Chicken Sliders and the Firecracker Salmon.  My favorite specialties are the Ranch House Burger, Steak Diane and the Grilled Shrimp & Bacon Club.  My favorite cheesecake is the Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake. It is absolutely amazing!   My favorite drinks are the Tropical Smoothie and the Frozen Iced Mango. They finally offer a kid's menu.

Cathy D.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,16,4,4.0,1/3/2016,"Came here on 12/30/16 on a rainy evening, there was about a 25 minute wait which was understandable because of the holidays and the weather. After being seated, we ordered the Ahi Carpaccio as an appetizer. Best decision ever, especially if you like raw fish/sushi. Best thing on the menu so far, honestly. We also ordered Smokehouse BBQ Burger and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish. Please come here on an empty/growling stomach because the portion sizes are MASSIVE. The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish could easily feed a family of four. We also ordered carrot cake-- which, as a carrot cake lover, I was a bit disappointed at the lack of cream between the layers, it was mostly just nut and very little cinnamon/spice taste. The Lemoncello Cream Torte was fresh and tasty! Our waitress disappeared for about 20 minutes and we ended up boxing the rest of our food to go. The total of all of this was ~75 dollars, not including tips. We took a Fresh Strawberry 6-inch cheesecake to go (waited for it to thaw, of course) ... the best cheesecake ever. So creamy and delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=160
Rolanda M.,"Portsmouth, VA",64,4,,3.0,4/10/2016,"I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory and have never truly has a bad experience until yesterday. I don't think people realize that bad service will ruin a meal. I have never been to a restaurant where I finished my appetizer long before my actual entree comes. It may seem extra bit when everyone around you (most of them came after you) have finished their entrees and are paying the bill and your food hasn't shown up then that's an issue. Not to mention the server barely coming to check on you or advise you of any delays. The food was good, the drinks were good (minus the suspect water) but the service pretty much will be the reason I won't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=160
Erika F.,"Baltimore, MD",658,246,2024,4.0,12/27/2014,Service is good and the location is clean. Waiters/waitresses are friendly and attentive when time is alloted for them. Food came out at a normal pace. I was just slightly dissatisfied with the size of my crispy crab bites and that the sauce lacked flavor and tasted like mostly mayonnaise but I could be wrong and realized that it is offered on the skinny menu. Maybe it's me or my taste buds but it seems at this location I need extra salt for every plate. I'll still patronize this one though. Good quality and huge servings.

Was elated this location stays open later than the nearby dining establishments. We were seated immediately and served without hesitation.

K. Q.,"Randallstown, MD",0,8,67,3.0,9/29/2015,"This was my first time coming here, so I didn't know what to expect. We got a beeper and an estimated wait of 20 mins which turned out to be 10, so it wasnt too bad. The ambience is very low lit and formal. Perfect for a dinner date. (There's no dress code BTW) and there's a good mix of booth and table seating. My utensils were dirty, but they were quickly replaced, so no problems there. We didn't get any bread, but I didn't want any so that was fine too. Our server was nice. We ordered chicken potstickers as an appetizer. They were half boiled, and pan fried on one side so the texture was weird, but they tasted okay Nothing too amazing. I got a raspberry lemonade (really sour) but the sugar on the rim of the glass helped out. And my boyfriend got a simple sprite since the only tea they had was unsweetened. The menu is about a thick book long and its filled with sidebar ads which distracted my from ordering. I ended up getting the chicken bellagio which sounded better than it tasted. The chicken breading was soggy, the arugala was bitter, the prosciutto was slimy and the pasta was a little on the aldente side. In fact the best part about my meal was the side order of Mac and cheese - An Ooey Gooey Overdose of Cheesie heaven served in a small cast iron dish. My boyfriend ordered the bacon bacon cheeseburger that had thick cut slabs of bacon (putting down my weak prosciutto) and he recommends it. I had a bite. It was delicious! The waitress took forever to come back with the doggie bags and check. And when she did, i ordered the salted caramel cheesecake to go The meal was around $78 (gratuity tip not included) Overall, the experience was pretty good. I guess simple is better when it comes to a place like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=100

The nachos were burnt and we did not get all of the food ordered(couple of sides missing) The back section of the restaurant was warm and seemed like the ac wasn't working.

We were immediately seated and the server came after a few minutes to take our drink order. He quickly returned to take our food order. In the meantime, he brought over bread and butter. I had the lunch special chicken chinese salad which comes with a plum sauce. it was very tasty but they were cheap with the chicken and it comes with mountain high fried rice noodles on top. I had to ask for a plate to throw that part away - wasteful, I know. My favorite part was that the server provided us each with our own receipt- score! It is not common for a restaurant to split a bill for a party of 6 - we didn't even ask, but when he suggested, we were thrilled!

There was so much going on that it took me a good 30 minutes to decide what I wanted, and then I changed my mind 10 times. I know that people like choices, but this menu has way too many choices. I simply loved the stuffed mushrooms. I ordered the shrimp tacos and loved the contents of the taco but hated the taco shell. It fell apart and I was not able to eat my taco in the traditional fashion with my hands. The waiter also dropped one of my shrimp in the water glass of the person sitting next to me, and he would have dumped the contents of my plate in my lap if I hadn't been quick to grab my plate. I ended my meal with a to-go slice of Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake. I nibbled on that slice of cheesecake each day for three days. It was rich, decadent, and so freaking good.

The view out of the restaurant is of the harbor, and when you go during the convention weekends, it's really fun to sit there and watch all the dressed up people walk around the harbor. I accidentally went one weekend during otakon, and got to see people dressed up in all sorts of costumes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=120

Devon R.,"Columbia, MD",13,5,4,1.0,7/10/2016,"This had to be the worst place, I decided to go spend my hard earn money on a Sunday afternoon.  We sat ourselves at the high chairs which was  not a issue since the place was extremely busy. So we sat down waited for 15 minutes, the waiter came expressed about the soup of the day. We listen to that and asked whats good on the menu. Waiter told us about the few items which was blah, so we went with our choices. Which anyone can relate to. 1. We ordered the shrimp rolls which was very greasy to the point which our hands were super oily. We bearly could of eaten them because they were dripping of oil. 2. The dynamite shrimp tasted like imitation shrimp, and breaded to the point where we had to strip the bread off to try it. That was uneatable as well.  3. The so called - potato tots was verrrrry nasty and super oily. If you want to get a clogged artery, and have high cholesterol go this place. 4. We got there at 4pm, waiter brought our drinks at 4:35. Got bread at 5:15pm. Then took our order for 3 basic appetizer. I could of went to PF Chang's and enjoyed the service and food but wanted to try the hype behind this place. It was a very nasty, poor customer service, and horrible place to enjoy food. The crazy part is that I didn't want to write a review but the service & food was so disgusting that I felt compelled too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=120

Iris V.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,,1.0,8/23/2015,"Being a Cheesecake Factory fan ...i was extremely disappointed in this location. We had someone in our party who was celebrating a birthday.  We asked to be seated outside and we were.  Every now and then the breeze blew by and it smelled funky. We ordered an app to share and then our food which included salad and miso salmon with white rice.  The app arrived and we were told the bread was coming. The food came and was dropped off.  No salad no bread.  The salmon had brown rice.  The waiter Erin never came by to see if the food was ok.  I had to flag another waiter down to ask if he could ask Erin to come to our table.  Everyone else had finished their meals before Erin arrived. The white rice was delivered ...we were done with our meals when the bread and salad arrived.   One plate which still had some tomatoes and sauce was pucked up and taken away by Erin without asking if the customer was done ...which she was not.  She had been dipping bread (now that we finally received it) in the sauce.  She went so fast and didnt even look us ...so we were not able to stop her. This is unacceptable and we got nothing more than im trying to get it out to you when we asked about the bread.   No heartfelt apology ...no visit from the manager no comps even though they knew we were there celebrating a birthday.  Not that a birthday customer should have a better experience ...but it was a special occassion. We were so over it and ready to leave that we left the credit card behind.  When picking it up the following day ...a manager said he had it and would pull it out of the safe and would be RIGHT with us.  Fifteen minutes later ...we see the manager behind the cheesecake counter doing all sorts of things ...looking right at me on one occassion and not even acknowledging my existence.  He was on his way to the other side of the room when we grabbed him and his excuse was ""i got pulled in a different direction"".  This from a manager?  Again ...missing out on that heartfelt apology. Dont go there!  There are many other wonderful restaurants in the area that will want your business.  I wish I had looked at the reviews before going.  Didnt think I could go wrong with this chain ...I was wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=120

We requested to sit outside and were seated right away.  Our waitress (can't give a name because she did not have a name badge on, but she had blue hair) took our drink order, which was a Sprite an 2 Arnold Palmers. The Sprite came about 10 minutes later, but no Arnold Palmers. Have you ever been in a restaurant that all the drinks were not brought out at the same time? Then we were told that the bar was making them. What the what? As I watched our waitress walking in and the door and still no drinks, I started to get a little peeved. Now, we are at 20 minutes, and still no drinks. I told my husband I was ready to go. If this was any indication of how long our food was going to take, I was no longer game.  The waitress came to our table (still no drinks) and said something about not having something. Ummm...our drinks maybe???I informed her at this point that we were paying for the drink we did get and were leaving.  No apology. Nothing. Charged us $3.00 for the soda and said nothing.

Napkins, toilet paper, etc.  I go to the front and ask for a manager to let them know about the bathrooms and sit there for 10 minutes (not exaggerating) and then just leave.  Anyways we got our check and I left my credit card in it for 20 minutes (not exaggerating) and our waiter was nowhere to be found.  My gf just left cash for the waiter and he lost a little on the tip but we couldn't wait around any longer.

Later when our food arrived, my friend that was cut off earlier got his food later than everyone else. My food was not great. The only mod i asked for did not happen (no tomatoes) and my fries were cold. My burger tasted very bland and was not all it was hyped up to be.

Kevin B.,"Riverdale Park, MD",28,9,7,4.0,5/15/2014,"This was the 4th Cheesecake Factory location I've dined at and it was a pretty satisfying experience even compared to the others. Being right in the heart of Baltimore's Inner Harbor, it was fairly busy. Luckily we decided to go when the weather was nice and the sky was clear. We were seated in less than 5 minutes and sat inside but by the open windows so there was a nice breeze coming in. The food was what you'd expect from The Cheesecake Factory franchise. This time around I got the Bang Bang Chicken amd Shrimp entree. Wasn't that big of a fan of it though. The sauce with the rice was flavorful but the chicken and shrimp itself were pretty bland and a little tough. I also had a Pina Colada which I enjoued even though I don't like alcohol all that much. My friends ordered Filet Mignon, Buffalo Wings, and the Lemon Garlic Shrimp from the Skinnylicious menu. We also ordered the Pot Stickers appetizer which was REALLY flavorful. On the downside, our waitress was a little forgetful and we didn't get great service. We had to remind her to bring out the bread for us after we were seated. Overall we all had a pretty good experience. Personally I feel that the weather greatly influences how great, or horrible, your experience can be at this location.

Because I am nursing him, I haven't had dairy and eggs for 7 months!!  I've tried to go out to other food places. Most of them suggest that I get salad (um, thank you for that.) of course, you would think I am insane for going to Cheesecake Factory when I can't have egg or dairy! After all cheese is in the name. Oh you would have missed out. This guy, Paul (manager? If he's not, he should be) was absolutely amazing! He went above and beyond to take care of us. He even brought out a chef to customize our order! Because of Paul, I was able to have my favorite dish in forever! My son had great time exploring that doesn't send him to the emergency room.

Jill W.,"Baltimore, MD",37,112,36,2.0,6/12/2015,"The location is amazing. On the water, prime downtown Baltimore real-estate. Has a lot of potential. I'll be a pessimist and list the CONs first: - The bathroom was dirty.  -The host was seating someone for probably 4 minutes when we got there and so many employees walked by us, none of them acknowledging us with eye contact or a 'someone will be right here.' It was kind of frustrating.   When she returned she said ""Two?"" (as in ""Do you need a table for two?"") I said ""Outside, please"" and she said, ""We don't do outside service. Only to-go.""  I was kind of confused. I  guess it was because it was nighttime. But why would I order a nice, fairly pricey dinner to-go then un-package it 20 feet away?  I'd rather sit down and enjoy my meal with service. and be able to have a drink.  So we opted to sit down... -Our table was REALLY close to our neighbors table (maybe 1.5 feet away) and we were trying to have a nice quiet dinner out.  -The drinks are strong and tasty but REALLY expensive - $11 and $12, which once you add 20% tip equals $27 for two drinks. Ouch! -This may be a PRO to some but was a CON to me - the menu is beyond huge. It's an entire book. My boyfriend and I spent a very, very long time debating what we wanted to order. Chicken A VS. Chicken Pretty Similar to Chicken A, appetizer w/ seared tuna and avocado VS appetizer w/ seared tuna and soy sauce with dipping sauce... you get the idea.   This was overwhelming and I would prefer less options. PROs: -Amazing waterfront location. Found metered street parking fairly easily. -The Cheesecake is AMAZING!  We went simple and got the blueberry. So heavenly and presented well. -Food arrived quickly. I recommend getting your app then ordering your entree so they dont come out too close because the servers do not pace properly. -Jamaican Chicken and Shrimp was so excellent! My boyfriend and I shared it -the portions were huge. -Strong drinks. Service was decent, no problems and I was indifferent to our waitress. This place gets pricey if you add on drinks to your meal though.  I can imagine sitting on the waterfront has to be really nice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=120

Rachael B.,"Baltimore, MD",3,28,41,1.0,6/6/2017,"BAD. THE WORST. SMELLY. GROSS. UNPROFESSIONAL. JUST WTF. I don't even know where to start with this one. Just...don't go here you guys. Go to the one in Towson or Columbia...just so much no.  *EDIT: I can't really say to much about the restaurant as a whole...this review it mostly for the bar area only* Let me just say how bad it smelled in here ok? It smelled BAD. Whoever mopped the floor the previous night must have used old water or something because the whole front room smelled like clothes left in the washer for 2 days.  I wanted to give them benefit of the doubt and blame it on the harbor but as I walked around different parts of the restaurant it was obvious the smell was coming from the counters and floors.  Arrived at 5:15 on a Friday and it wasn't quite busy. People we were just starting to show up for the Happy Hour rush. Took a seat at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks. I'm guessing the bartender who was serving us was about to clock out or something because she kept rushing us through our orders and then giving us a check. (I'm assuming she wanted us to pay and tip before she left but we literally had just got there....) After she printed the 3rd check we had to tell her - ""Hey were gunna be here a while and probably order some more stuff so can you just keep the tab open???"" I mean really that should have been obvious from the start. But the real upset came when the next bartender showed up for her shift. She blew into the bar making a whole bunch of noise and then proceeded to CHANGE HER CLOTHES RIGHT AT THE BAR.  Shirt off. Bra out. Tummy out. JUST EVERYTHING OUT. WTF?? You guys don't have an employee lounge or locker room? A BATHROOM???? Like she really just changed her clothes in front of all us just sitting at the bar. AND THEN she decided she was just going to get to work taking orders and making drinks. Didn't wash her hands or anything. I get it. If your running late for work you want to jump right in and act like your working and do the damn thing. BUT AT LEAST WASH YOUR HANDS!!!!! She was sweaty and winded and it just overall wasn't a good look... Now hey- I know what you guys are thinking. She was probably having a rough one and I should cut her some slack. But even still- this was my first experience at this location and I'm sorry but it was a bad one and I have the right to express that! Half way through my time at the bar the manager had to come out with a toilet plunger and unclog some drain at the bar that was messed up.  ***Imaging sitting down at the bar trying to enjoy your meal when some guy comes right in front of you with a freaking plunger and starts thrusting it up and down right in front of your face*** No excuse me. No I apologize but... just WHAM. Out of nowhere he just pops in with a huge plunger and starts hacking away at a clogged drain.....wtf guys...what the....f*ck. One of the bartender girls was like, ""Haha did you get that from the bathroom?!"" He smirked and didn't answer... I REPEAT HE DID NOT ANSWER.  Everyone sitting at the bar just stared at the guy. Like....are you going to confirm to all of us t patrons that YES INDEED THAT TOILET PLUNGER WAS NOT ACTUALLY USED ON A FREAKING TOILET BEFORE YOU BROUGHT IT OUT HERE AND STARTED USING IT ON STUFF RIGHT NEXT TO OUR FOOD AND DRINKS???? Guys....just not. All the no.  0/10 would come again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=20

This one in particular was bustling non-stop from the second we walked in till we signed the check. If you're in the mood to stuff your face with tons of food, you've found your lunch spot. Falafel salad was good enough -- falafels themselves were actually delicious, but the salad was lacking in cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. -- and the avocado egg rolls could've used a bit more flavor.

Christina O.,"Baltimore, MD",220,145,1315,3.0,4/15/2016,"Early Dinner Date -_- My boyfriend and I came here on a very busy Sunday; I think there was a cheer leading competition or something. As soon as we walked in there was people everywhere waiting to be seated and we thought to ourselves oh boy! We went to the hostess stand and asked how long the wait would be and she said 30-40 minutes. Mind you we haven't ate all day and we were starving. We decided to wait the awful long 30 minutes. I manage to look around the bar area to see if there was seats for us. One couple finally got up and we took their place. We was excited and starving. Our waiter cleaned off our table and gave us some water to start off with. We had a while to look over the menu since it was super busy there. We decided on two small plates; stuffed mushrooms and chicken samosas. The chicken samosa was pretty good and the sauce that came with it was amazing; it gave it an extra zest to it. The stuffed mushrooms was okay, I was expecting a more explosion in my mouth; I love stuffed mushrooms but this one was okay :( We both ordered Cajun Jambalaya Pasta which we normally don't do. We tend to ordered different items to try each other entrees however; it sounded delicious! The presentation was beautiful however; the taste was very bland. You will need to add a lot of salt to the noodles. The chicken and shrimp was okay; plus the tomatoes was good too. The fettuccine pasta had regular pasta and green pasta. If you get this meal don't expect to be WOW by it. We was highly dissapointed! I would not recommend this entree. We literally ate the shrimp and chicken and a little bit of pasta and was done. Now on to the desert; we are Oreo lovers so of course we ordered the Oreo cheesecake. I have to say the Oreo cheesecake was the best part of our entire meal and that's just sad. We didn't finish it all due to being over stuffed and it being extremely fating haha. Our overall experience was okay, the server was very attentive; I forgot her name but she was nice and pleasant. I would come here again when it's not busy. This was my boyfriend first time at this particular location and he wasn't  impressed.

I'm not a fan of chain restaurants normally but I will say that this is a little better than some. Since parking is horrible in the harbor i prefer to go to the Columbia location. Today I went to Happy hour and I never ever had a problem with customer service here is always top notch to be a chain but today I'm guessing it was a manager or supervisor screaming to the bartender that just came on duty ""you are over pouring"" and of course he didn't hear him the 1st time and he comes and says it 2 times while me and other guests are sitting there which to me is so unprofessional he could have pulled him to the side. On top of the shift change along with the rush of guest coming in. Now do I want to hear the bartender is over posting drinks that wasn't mine? Nope! So yup I'm upset. Now to the nice happy hour menu everything was $5.95 you can't beat that! Now to the selection of cake, cheesecake and so on. I'm in love with everything here.

I told her I will pay for my bill at the front counter and will pass on the cheesecake because I did not have a whole afternoon to waste. She shouted at me and demanded I pay her specifically because she was my server. I'm very disappointed that she did not apologize for anything and she made a scene. The manager also did not approach to resolve the issue. I'm a customer. I can spend my money anywhere and I chose to spend it here.

Camice J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,10/7/2017,"This review is for Paul Herbert-manager. Yesterday, I had the unfortunate experience visiting this establishment.  I work for a major humanitarian organization, and I value the treatment of such practices.  Upon arriving to establishment, I ordered a drink from the bar. The glass was filthy, however the bartender was amazing about it and swapped glasses quickly. We were seated by an amazing waitresses ( the epitome of what this place should model in terms of service) named Jayla B. I selected this place as I wanted something familiar to celebrate my boyfriends work accomplishments. Let me cut to the chase, after reviewing the menu, I selected an item that I thought were buffalo chicken blast-which I now know are discontinued thanks to Google.  However, I received something very different. After politely asking the woman (not my waitress) who set my order down what happened to the buffalo chicken blast, she rudely told me I had the wrong restaurant and did I want them or not? I I asked for my waitress, as I do not engage in someone's lack of knowledge about the history of discontinued items in the manner she presented herself. Jayla B took our order. The food arrived unpleasantly cooked and lacked taste ( we ordered Cajun pasta with a side of Alfredo as we did this before). The manager Paul Herbert came to ask us about the meal we returned. Now, my boyfriend is a ""go with the flow man"" and even he hated it.  After telling Paul my issue , and then repeating my cold appetizer and dirty glass experience, he rudely responded, ""The cajun sauce is a broth (yelp readers, please note that this menu item is listed as a Cajun cream based sauce and not a broth) and the reason the meal was bad is because you added Alfredo."" Shocked (as I also own a very popular catering company and work as the head chef in addition to my day job) I responded that the broth should have flavor to add decadence to the ingredients in the dish. Furthermore, me adding Alfredo (which looked like evaporated milk-guess the chef was heavy handed on the whipping cream in the sauce and forget to season the entire meal) should have complimented the dish, but such an addition was not the reason it lacked flavor and texture. I also mentioned that the sauce ""broth"" (whatever Paul mentioned) did not even hold the noodles and my dish was watery. Paul tries to convince me I was the reason I did not like it. I ask for my waitress Jayla. Jalya, whom was AMAZING, took another order for us (please note, I have been here for two full hours now.) This meal came back terrible as well. Disgruntled, we ordered what we came for-dessert.  I asked Jayla how the bill would be handed. She said she would bring her manager. Guess who comes back? Paul. I asked Paul how he would adjust the bill after explaining my experience with both meals, and his less than exemplary customer service and rudeness. I asked him what he should do to ensure I invite my colleagues back or how he wanted me to share my overall unsatisfactory experience at his restaurant. I added that the highlight of my evening was Jayla and how well she treated us knowing we were unhappy and did not eat a meal. Paul kneels beside me, seeing the second meal touched by one bite of dissatisfaction.  This man says, "" I took care of the appetizer but because you ordered a second meal. You are going to pay for it."" I repeated, I'd be more than happy to pay for what I consumed, however, I was not paying for what I did not eat- the second meal. After moments of back and forth banter, he told me I was paying and had ""police on deck"" to handle situations like this. I did not mind him calling the police because I was the one being robbed-being charged for 2 meals not eaten.    During this time, the dessert came (Paul went to get the bill). I had requested the dessert to be voided. Paul told Jayla to take the dessert away because I was not paying for it. Jayla looked confused, but followed the bosses orders- who lacks the competence and professionalism to have the position. When the bill came, Paul told me he was not leaving till I payed.  He stood up beside me, and hovered over my table for the duration of this experience.  Mind you, the ONLY reason I paid was because my boyfriend dislikes confrontation of this measure and we had a flight to catch. I paid for the second meals, although I told Paul it did not meet my expectations in our earlier conversation. He gave me his card and told me he would be okay if I shared this experience, so I am. After this, I will call the Better Business Bureau, write Corporate and share my experience on all social medias for this location. Furthermore, every single friend and colleague will not visit this establishment when in town for business.   I will not rest until Paul receives the necessary training, education, intelligence and empathy to be a manager of a food chain in which prides themselves​ in the customer service experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=20

I tried the pasta and it was horrible and dry! There was more seasoning on the side of the plate as decoration then the actual pasta. The waiter took the pasta back in hopes of it to come back with taste but it came back with oil and dry seasoning. It was so bad the manager even apologized and said that it wasn't cooked right, they gave me the option of trading the dish for something else so I choose to pack the crab wontons and the apple caramel cheesecake.

The menu is so overwhelming with pages and pages of delicious options that I almost chose something different about 3 or 4 times before settling on the filet mignon cooked medium rare and I must say it was probably the most perfectly cooked filet mignon I've ever had and I've frequented my share of high-end steak restaurants.  I experienced several bites that literally melted in my mouth.  I regard a steak highly that does not require any steak sauce and this one fit the bill. The waitress was patient with me as I tried to pick a dish that would satisfy my picky youngest who wanted to try shrimp like his big brother and suggested a dish and recommended modifications to fit his picky palate.  I was set at ease to see he gobbled every last piece of shrimp and even went to his brother's side to try to scavenge from his plate as well! We ended the meal with a slice of their beyond compare Key Lime Cheesecake --which is a MUST for any visit to the Cheesecake Factory!  My oldest got a slice of the chocolate cake --which looked decadent and mouth-watering. I even ordered about 4 pieces of cheesecake to take To Go --including the Mango Key Lime one which I will probably not order ever again, but that's OK.  I just wanted to try it out.  The coconut flake infused crust did not meet my expectations, but if you LOVE coconut you may take to it better.

We were seated around 8pm. When it came time to order our meal, the waitress promptly informed is they were out of bacon and French fries. Being vegetarian we could give a shit about the bacon but the bf had actually been in the mood for French fries. Eventually we realized we never received the complementary bread which arrives hot and fresh almost instantly at the Columbia location. I encourage you to take a guess as to why. Yea...you guessed it; they were out of bread too. Seriously guys?! You're running out of menu staples on a Saturday in the summer before the sun has even set? Most peculiar of all was later in the meal when the waitress said something along the lines of ""blah blah blah we have French fries now"". Huh? How'd that happen?  For dinner we ordered artichoke spinach dip, avocado spring rolls and vegan Cobb salad. The dip was watered down to the point where I wonder if they were running out of that too so decided to add water and flour which would also explain the lack of flavor.

Thankfully my daughters mac and cheese came out fast and it was actually delicious!  We ordered the chicken taquitos for an appetizer, they came out on a hot plate and were comically bad. They were squishy and the filling was very bland. It was also smothered in tomatoes and sitting in some sort of sauce that I'm sure destroyed the integrity of the taquito, but I wasn't even interested in picking it up to investigate.  When our food came out my husbands shrimp scampi was lukewarm at best. The pasta was stuck together and had the shrimp actually been warm would have probably been very good. The plate was screaming hot so it obviously sat under the warmer lights for a while.  I got the Thai lettuce wraps as my entree. I've had them before at other locations and love them hence me ordering it again. The components looked fine, but the chicken had big chunks of burnt pieces (probably the sugar in the seasoning, but it was black... eww).  When we let the waitress know the taquitos were not good she said 'oh, they were nasty?' Umm... yeah that's why we didn't eat them, so then she took them and disappeared. We sat for a few minutes just wanting our check so we could leave. After a while my husband went and tracked down a manager who was very nice and apologetic, but it was almost too little too late.

Also, I got a side salad instead of fries and it was just lettuce...no veggies!  Secondly, my partner is a vegetarian and wanted to get the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp minus the meat and substitute in veggies(broccoli, spinach, and avocado). The waitress checked in with either the chef or manager(not sure who) and told us they could make it, but that it would be an extra dollar for avocado. The dish was already $18.95 for chicken and shrimp and they're telling us that it will be $19.95 to have veggies instead of meat!!! What?!?!?! That doesn't even make sense; we were both livid. It was definitely not worth the money.  The sangria was weak and at $11.00 a glass; I expected better.  The avocado spring rolls came with a tamarind cashew dipping sauce; both were delicious and a definite highlight of the experience.  Thankfully, the waitress and service was on point.

I had to eat it with a knife and fork.  The lettuce in my salad seemed wilted! They sat us in the back by the door that the workers constantly went in and out of multiple times!

We knew the entree sizes are typically HUGE, so we decided to share appetizers (goat cheese and beet salad, mini crab cakes, buffalo blasts, fried mac and cheese, korean cauliflower).  Food was ok.  The beet salad was probably the tastiest.   All in all, a safe choice.  Not spectacular, but not horrible either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore

We sat down, ordered drinks about 10 minutes later, ordered food, didn't get bread for another 15, and finally eventually our food. The food we got was pretty good though. I got the chicken Marsala and BF got a shrimp pasta dish. My pasta probably could have fed a small army it was HUGE. I definitely had enough for dinner the next day.

We sat outside on the patio where we listened to nearby music and looked at the water. Our server suggested a sauvignon blanc that I enjoyed very much, and I also ordered an impressively tasty iced coffee. my friend ordered a smoothie that she is still talking about.  Upon looking at the extensive menu, we decided perhaps an appetizer was in order. I chose the Ahi Tuna Tartare. I've never seen such beautiful food presentation at a chain restaurant and I would definitely order it again. Our friends joined us and after looking at the menu ordered a Georgia peach , chicken Picatta, and I believe a Turtle cheese cake. All were delicious.   The food was so good I strongly suggested to my husband (who had an event at the convention center that day) that we go back, he agreed and I returned with him, and I talked it up so much a group of his friends from the convention center joined us. I ordered the same wine, he ordered an iced coffee, and his friends ordered smoothies(with the same reaction as my friend had the day before). We ordered Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls (the Peanut sauce was amazing). We ordered Thai coconut lime chicken, bacon-bacon cheeseburger, Louisiana chicken pasta, pasta Napoletana, and four cheese pasta-each of which we all tasted and loved. The food was very flavorful and unique and the food presentation was beautiful. For dessert we had a lemoncello torte, lemon raspberry cheesecake, salted caramel cheesecake, black tie cheesecake, and Chris's outrageous cheesecake.

Unfortunately we have no utensils, no napkins, no anything. And the image I remember of my brother messily rubbing butter onto his bread with his bare hands is what best represents this...establishment.    Aside from the manager's ability to calmly handle the situation, this place was a complete mess. The extremely long waiting times definitely wore down our spirits by the time the waitress even showed up. I haven't the faintest idea why they sat us down when they didn't even have UTENSILS! And in between every different problem there was a 15 minute wait for the waitress to return! Our appetizers were a whole different story too! After an hour and a half of waiting we find out that there was some problem with them and we'd have them available WITH our main course, 15 minutes from now. We told her to just cancel it, and 10 minutes later a cook comes out with it anyways. I have no earthly idea what happened there but clearly there was an absence of basic communication. Finally our food arrives, and everyone can agree it was mediocre, room temperature, and overall, certainly not worth the completely ridiculous prices. And on top of all this, our waitress noticed we were a tad disappointed, and she continued the night with the worst attitude one could imagine, causing trouble for us at any turn possible.     Overall, this was a gigantic mess on everyone's part. Completely overpriced, completely mediocre, and a complete waste of our time- a long 3 hours down the drain. I can't even imagine what was happening behind the scenes, but we most certainly should not have been even SEATED if they don't have enough forks, knives, or even napkins.

Jasmine T.,"Washington, DC",512,100,118,2.0,11/25/2013,"This is a very unfortunate Cheesecake Factory location. I feel it has a lot of great potential, but need stronger management in terms of training staff on hospitality. I've only dined here once and it will be my last time.  We arrived around 3:00 pm on a Saturday to catch a late lunch. We only ended up there because the place I really wanted to go to had weekend happy hour (La Tasca), but it didn't start until 4pm. We didn't feel like waiting a whole hour, so we decided to brave the crowd at Cheesecake Factory.  Since there was a 45 minute wait for a table, we sat in the bar area - which we were told - was attended to by a waiter. We noticed when we sat down there was the folder that contains the check and 50 cents laying on our table. We were surprised someone would leave such a crappy ""tip""; however, we should have taken it as an omen. A sign sent from God to run far...far away from The Cheesecake Factory! We saw the waiter a couple of times, he visited several other tables but it took him 15 minutes to come to our table and take our drink orders. It took him another 15 minutes to make it back to the table. Bread...10 minutes...taking our food order another 10 minutes...we were trying to be patient. We know that we were sitting in the bar area, but we saw him talking to other parties. We were more confused than anything -- why would he talk to other patrons, but not to us? I blame my personal lack of confrontation on the sheer fact that I was terribly hungry. After finally coming back to our table to take our meal orders we noticed it took the server a while to actually put them into the computer. I finished my drink and wanted another, but he had not returned to the bar area. I approached the bartender and tried to order a cranberry juice. She was very rude and even hostile! The lady wouldn't even pour me a cranberry juice; mind you I'm hungry, thirsty and very tired of waiting at this point. I even tried to explain to her that we had been waiting a long time, but she cut me off and told me order it from my server. She summoned the same server to the bar area, told him that I wanted a cranberry juice and he brought it over...5 minutes later (eye roll.)  When I received my food it wasn't hot, meaning it probably had been sitting in the kitchen for quite a while. It tasted good, but it kind of doesn't make up for the fact that we received such poor service. I was too hungry to send it back, but we did let him know it was cold and that we felt we waited for a very long time. The only reason we didn't ask for a manager was because it was too busy. The restaurant side was crazy, and disorganized so we can only imagine the problems guests may have been experiencing.

The tuna and the salads were fresh and seasoned just right, but our kids were not too happy about their dishes of the kids menu.

I've been to Cheesecake Factory on plenty of occasions and it is one of my favorite chains so I figured this one would be no different. I was wrong. When we first walked in, a party of 3, we told the hostesses and they were so busy giggling and laughing amongst themselves that we were sitting there with blank stares wondering if they were really even helping us. When we did finally get seated, our waitress, who I wish I remembered her name, came over and took our drink requests. Neither of our drinks were alcoholic, all regular drinks. It took us 15 minutes to get those and that's when we knew this was going to be a long night.  To be a Friday night, they were not particularly crowded. We figured with as many empty tables there were, we would be able to catch a movie afterwards. We put in our food orders and waited another 30 mins for our food. When we got our food, my order was wrong. I ordered 'Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon' salmon, asparagus, mashed potatoes. I received a 'Herb Crusted Salmon Salad'. When they sent it back, the manager came out. Told me there were two similar things on the menu and she just got confused. The waitress never apologized for the mixup. Came over hundreds of times but never said sorry about that. Waited another 30 mins before I got my food. When my friend ordered cheesecake, she brought it out and then she decided she wanted it in a box. The waitress walked around to about 3 or 4 tables with the cake in hand, breathing over it and the customers breathing over it, before she finally went to the back with it.

She didn't greet us or ask us how many in our party.  She just stared at us like we were somehow bothering her. I told her we had a party of 3. She typed something in her screen, then threw her hands up and yelled with attitude ""All tables are full, 10 min wait, what's your name?"" She was the rudest hostess we've ever encountered, anywhere.  Obviously we walked into the middle of some sort of employee augment that had the ladies upset.  The result for us was a completely hostile, unprofessional and unpleasant atmosphere.   At that point we decided this may not be the best place to have lunch and left.

We frequent the factory but this is our first time at this location. Thank Goodness!! We went in with the family and during our dinner, auuuh while we were eating huhh. My youngest child spotted a critter crawling on the back of my daughters seat. He was trying to tell my daughter and he began waving his hand in the air. I figure he thought it was a fly. Well the dang thing never flew away. Once he finally caught her attention she almost knocked the whole table over and the food that was on it. She had her other brother almost on the floor trying to get out the seat. This is ridiculous. Yes, come to find out it was a ROACH!! Yes, roaches at the cheesecake. I NEVER... I waved down the manager and showed him our visitor. He said he would move us and our food. We were standing up waiting until they could clear off a table. Well it took about 5 minutes for that to happen it was not quick, let me just say that. We continued on trying to enjoy the evening but it was hard. The manager took my name, address and number and told me someone would be in contact after an issue like this because they would need to know what happened among other things. Well as I said, I waited before I put this post up as we visited this location November 15th and still no contact from Mr. Cheesecake. Come on now!! Definitely will not be back here unless I read about a insect tent going over this place because we know ROACHES don't live alone. If there is one... there are 2 more.....Mom and dad... yes!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=200

Please note that I don't live in a city with a Cheesecake Factory. And I don't have a car. So it's kind of an extra impressive/extra chubby feat.

Mine did not come with the lettuce and tomato listed on the menu and which I specifically requested. The waitress, Erin, who we had been very polite to, threw a stack of bar napkins on our table (which we didn't request - is that CFs idea of service?) and asked ""how is everything?"" but literally walked away, mid-sentence, before our reply. When I drop $50 on a lunch for two people, I'd like the experience to be better than you'd be treated at a fast food place - it's definitely not, here, and there are too many nearby competing restaurants, with great service.

For eats, we had the Fried Mozzarella to satisfy the salty and the Red Velvet Cheesecake to satisfy the sweet. Perfection!  For the modest price we paid, we left very satisfied and we were happy with the service.

Ashley P.,"Warwick, RI",408,540,1280,4.0,6/22/2010,"Cheesecake Factory remains in my top list of chain restaurants to partake in.  Their excellent quality appears to remain the same across the board.  Whether it be on vacation in Baltimore, MD or back home in Lil' Rhody, you're sure to encounter exceptional service and mouthwatering meals.  This is a reassuring this to have, especially when you aren't sure where you can grab a tasty meal wherever you happen to be.   The menu is ridiculously extensive, leaving you with a top 3 - 4 things you'd like to order.  They overestimated our wait by about 30 minutes, which was a pleasant surprise.  We were seated outdoors, under a canopy, with a beautiful view of the inner harbor.  Fans created a gentle breeze creating a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere in this crowded restaurant.   It was here the bf and I decided to partake in this locale's famed crab cakes. . . and tasty they were.  The chicken teriaki entree is packed with flavor, though I could have done without the grilled fruits adorning the edges of the plate.  While I would have loved to over-indulge in a plating of cheesecake, I was filled to the brim with my main meal.  There is no way anyone could eat all the food they serve in one sitting.  Had we been planning on setting back to the hotel, I would have certainly wrapped it up for a second visit.   I recommend this place to both locals and tourists who find themselves in the area.  And props to the poor waiter who had to deal with the awfully picky party seated behind us. . . .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=180

I've gone to quite a few, and it's always a safe option, with generous portions and good food if you pick the right choices.  Unfortunately, this one in inner harbor is no exception to some of the Cheesecake downsides, including not accepting reservations for small groups and the long waits for a table and for dinner to come out. It's in a good location if you're coming from public transportation, but a little hard to find parking. (Of course, this is inner harbor.) You get a bread basket with butter as you're waiting for your food. The dark bread is always gone in a second.  The menu itself is very overwhelming if you're a first timer. My go-to's are usually the pastas, specifically:  -Louisiana Chicken Pasta -Evelyn's Favorite Pasta -Pasta Da Vinci (-Cajun Jambalaya) Otherwise, specialties and burgers are good. Salads are nice, but I find that the prices are a little too high for what you get.  Cheesecake recs  (note: I always go for those that are not super heavy, as the red velvet and 30th anniversary chocolate are): -Godiva is always a winner for rich, dark chocolatey goodness -Banana Cream  -The Original/Strawberry -Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake for something interesting (slightly heavy)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=180

I started with the Roadside Sliders (8.95) yum, about 4 or 5 palm sized tasty sliders cooked to my requested medium rare, very tasty. My friend had the Crab cake app,(12.95) it looked great. For my entree I did the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo (16.95) a great dish of spicy chicken,shrimp and diced ham served over a bed of brown or white rice. I like. My friend did the Cajun Jambalaya,(16.95) quite good as there was little talking while we feasted.   The iced tea here is some of the best tea I've had in a restaurant. the bread is delish too.  For dessert I tried the Lemoncello Creme Torte,(6.95) wow. I loved it. My dining companion took some cheesecake home. The check was about 100 bucks.

Vic G.,"Quincy, MA",976,416,471,3.0,6/9/2015,"Quite a mixed set of feelings about this Cheesecake Factory. I do like this chain. They are very consistent and clearly - they know their niche - the cheesecakes.  This location is in the Inner Harbor mall. A prime location with tourists and locals making it a very busy hot spot. There is quite a bit of seating outside when the weather is nice. And if going here during usual peak hours or weekends - expect a wait - as is the case at most other locations. Here's why the place gets 3 stars in a nutshell.  - Decor / design: The place is over crowded with more tables than it ideally should have. Especially the outdoor seating, was simply put - chaotic. We got a table for 6 outside and although the view of the harbor was pretty, our table was right next to 2 other tables and it was quite a mall cafeteria kind of experience. Then there was this whole umbrella issue. The attendants outside could not have the tables covered with enough umbrellas given it was s scorcher of a day. Again - very chaotic.  At one point, we considered moving indoors. But after taking a quick look inside, it wasn't a great idea to switch tables. It was a massive wait for a table inside. So we stuck to what we got.  Food: I don't think I have ever had a reason to dislike their food. If there is one thing I can describe the food as - it would be consistently the same across the board. No matter which location you go to, you know you are at Cheesecake Factory. Given the hot summer day - I got a salad. Sheila chicken with avocados. Very light and fresh through and through. Others next to me got fish and chips and Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. Everyone was happy with their meals including myself. Service: This was a very mixed experience. First the positive. Our waitress was very kind and always around to check on us. Our meals arrived on time. We were quite happy. Now The negative. The staff outside wasn't very accommodating with the arrangements. Primarily the umbrella situation that I mentioned above. This is probably a point that should be noted by the management of this branch. They should either reduce the table count outside or figure out a way to make the patrons comfortable outside when it is hot and humid outside.  For food alone, I would rate this location 4 stars. For the overall experience - the 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=80

I love Cheesecake Factory, and I travel for work; so whenever there is a location in the city that I'm in, I go enjoy one of my fave menus. This Baltimore location is an embarrassment to the chain. I went to eat with my friend. After waiting over 20 minutes for guacamole as as appetizer, it then took 40 minutes for our food to arrive, the table side service was few and far between (only refilling my water one time, etc.) we ended up having to have our food boxed because of time. I was very disappointed, but have the benefit of the doubt.  My mistake.  4 days later I ordered guacamole for pick-up 15 min before leaving work. I figured it was an easy enough request. When I got there to pay and retrieve, I had a To-go box of what what very clearly just mushed up avocado. I respectfully asked that it be sent back to have GUACAMOLE ingredients added. Trying to maintain patience as I stood waiting, my view of the kitchen shocked and startled me. NO GLOVES...people directly preparing and boxing food with bare hands. Employees eating food that they were boxing up for paying customers. Mind you, this is in plain view of all guests. I will never return to this location and made my concerns known. The manager was decent, and refunded me for the guac...but honestly seemed like he had no idea what he was doing. I am so sad to have to write a review like this :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=80
Robin P.,"Baltimore, MD",66,169,202,2.0,8/20/2015,"Giving only two stars pains me - it really does. But that's about all I can muster after our visit this past Friday evening. My kids were in from Milwaukee for the weekend and coming to a nationwide staple seemed like the right thing to do given our experiences in Wisconsin, Arizona, and California. This experience in Maryland, however, was not a stellar one. Granted, it was busy when we sat down...but isn't this place usually always busy unless the doors just opened for the day? At least that's been my experience over the years. We ordered an appetizer (Parmesan-garlic cheese bread) that didn't arrive until after our entrees. Ooops. It was swiftly removed from our bill, thankfully. Our entrees were mediocre at best. My son's fettuccine alfredo with shrimp was sorely lacking in the shrimp department - come on! We're on the water, for heaven's sake! I don't think there is a shortage of shrimp in the area. His girlfriend's rib eye steak was a bit overdone and was, sadly, fatty - lots of waste to be had. She ordered it because of her iron deficiency anemia and felt that ""some steak would do my body good."" Suffice to say, we needed to make up for it and find other natural sources of iron over the course of the weekend. My veggie burger was the highlight of the three orders - it was very good. Perfectly cooked and with sweet potato fries on the side? I was a happy girl. My kids? Not so much. Being lactose intolerant, I passed on the cheesecake but my kids happily indulged in slices of strawberry and chocolate - their eyes spoke volumes and dessert was clearly the highlight of their experience. I guess the place lived up to their ""cheesecake"" name...that's about all, though, this time around.

I literally stepped in, had a look around, and immediately stepped out. This location has to be one of the filthiest and most unkept Cheesecake Factory restaurants I have ever witnessed. In front of the kitchen area there were bags of trash laying around and each time I would pass by the location (I was in the downtown area for 5 days) I would see kitchen workers hanging directly outside the restaurant smoking. During my very abrupt visit, I also noticed a bum causing commotion as staff were trying to get rid of him. From what I saw, it was being handled sincerely and professionally.

The crust had the perfect amount of crisp. Also, the pizza was huge so I got to take home half of it! I had the regular tiramisu for dessert, which was tasty although it was very dense. I wonder if that might have been the cheesecake version that they accidentally brought out instead of the regular tiramisu. I tried a bite of the new Smores cheesecake, and I wasn't a huge fan.

Children can be real picky eaters so we needed to go to a place with a childrens' menu. Luckily, their vast menu accommodated to our entire group. The kids were happy, the cocktails were pretty tasty, and everyone got to order what they were in the mood for. Service was good even though the place was packed on a Saturday evening, but ultimately the food was not very good.  While I can recommend their luxurious cheesecakes (I like the tiramisu cheesecake most), their food is severely lacking. My chicken picatta was oily, lacked flavor, and the chicken was dry.

Very disappointed in the way things were handled and how rude the hostess was about the situation, despite telling her in advance we'd need the stroller. We would have gladly waited longer for a table where we could have had the baby by our table comfortably. Instead my family ate supper without 2 members joining us.

And the fries were also amazing. We ordered red velvet cheesecake for dessert, which was huge and split among three people. Which was also very delicious. On top of the awesome food was the awesome service. I asked our waitress early on if they had onion rings and ranch dressing, in which she told me, ""We don't have onion rings, but those do sound delicious with ranch."" Later on as I was enjoying my meal, the waitress came back with a cup of ranch dressing for me to dip my fries in. They were absolutely divine dipped in ranch dressing. And the best part was, I felt like the waitress actually cared about me because she remembered me talking about ranch dressing earlier for onion rings. And on top of the awesome food and services, was the awesome price. Considerably less expensive compared to other restaurants in the inner harbor area.

James R.,"Baltimore, MD",3,48,1,2.0,3/15/2013,"It could happen anywhere, but I had a bad experience with a roach ending up in my caesar salad. It scared the 6 other women at the table more than it did me. The waiter was apologetic and offered to make it right by getting me something else on the house...which I thought was a classy move. When the check came, they had not comp'd the meal as promised, so I asked about it. A manager came over and was implying that he would not credit the meal, only my appetizer. Eventually he relented because the ladies at my table began to make a stink about it on my behalf. I didn't ask for a free meal, but it was offered, so they should have honored what they promised. It's a case where a bad customer experience turned worse due to not doing the right thing to correct an unfortunate mistake. In general though, there is ALWAYS a 30-60 minute wait for seating at this location. There is also a very long wait for service and food once seated. There is not enough waitstaff for the amount of tables when it's filled to capacity, IMO. If you don't mind waiting, it's fine, but this is the main reason I don't frequent this location.

Lotsa butter and lotsa taste, can't go wrong. My favorite entree by far would have to be the pasta jambalaya (popular dish) and the bang bang chicken is also very good (Asian, Thai taste).

I liked my egg rolls, it was filling, nice presentation. all fine and good at this point. but then the check came.. and on it was the ahi dish. so we told the server, who took it off. so our bill went from 38 to 30 and change. friend hands over a $40 gift card. it comes back as only having an extra 3+ bucks as a balance, which was weird but hey, maybe there was some kind of gift card fee. so we leave her the rest of the card as the tip, and I put an extra 2 bucks on the table. she goes home and checks, and somehow someone has authorized 36 and change to be put on the card.. which is why it was showing a 3+ dollar balance. not 30, not 38.. but an extra 6 bucks, and cleaned out the rest of the card with the tip. and got cash too. fortunately it was a gift card, and only a matter of 5-10 bucks.. buuuuuuut if this happens often, nightly, maybe with bigger checks and other credit cards.. thats a problem. there is a survey on the receipt, and she gets $10 for filling it out, so she gets her money back there. theres also a line up top that says ""separate checks"", making us wonder if she rang up a separate one to clear the card. I don't know. ive never been ripped off at a restaurant, so this is a first for me. **update.. friend did the online survey to talk about this issue, and get her $10 egift card.. they sent her an email back saying thank you for participating in the survey, your gift is enclosed. that's it. no attachment to get to the $10, no link, no nothing. good job guys. thanks for the memorable first time experience here, I don't think ill ever return to any in this chain. **2nd update.. customer service has gotten in touch, maybe they can work on the problem now. **3rd update.. my friends card was charged the correct amount about 2 weeks later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=300

Anyway, I like this place because it's a nice little ""hey let's pick up dessert on way back to the hotel room"" kind of places...but I made the mistake of eating lunch here because I was disappointed that Phillip's wasn't open.  NEVER.

Several other parties behind us were also being ignored.  After we FINALLY got our seats and were acknowledged, it took another twenty minutes to even get starter bread.

This particular Cheesecake Factory location is an egregious misrepresentation of the Cheesecake Factory name. I have dined at many other Cheesecake Factory locations and have been more than satisfied. My server lacked any personality or interest in making it an enjoyable dining experience. In fact, she was so disinterested, almost every item we ordered was incorrect. Another few things I was less than impressed with aside from the service were the plastic cups our water was served in, and the red lipstick smeared all around my wine glass. I believe I ordered Pinot noir, not Pinot noir with a side of rouge lipstick. I understand mistakes happen in the restaurant industry, but it comes to a point where it is unacceptable. The manager was far less than understanding and sympathetic. In fact, he defended the server and said he would not allow another server to take our inadequate server's duty to our table. After speaking with the manager it is clear to me why the servers have no pride in their work, there is no example to follow and no accountability.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=340
Shelby N.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,55,,3.0,7/30/2011,"OK so the main reason the cheesecake factory doesn't get a 4 or 5 stars from me, is simply because I prefer consistency when it comes to my food. I deem a establishment my favorite place why? because it gets it right time after time. The cheesecake factory sadly doesn't get it right for me consistently enough. First off no matter what time of day you, there will almost always be a wait. And that said wait can go anywhere from 5 minutes to a hour and a half and sadly they don't take reservations over the phone, so there is no calling in advance to hold a seat or to even put your name on the waiting list in advance. The ambiance is always warm and welcoming but there are two things that i don't quite like: 1) In the summertime, its basically a green house and unless you have a seat at the high tables by the bar, than you will be using your menus as a fan throughout your entire meal. 2) If you go in the winter than you will be wearing your jackets the entire time because you will be freezing. But I digress. oh yea that's right the food: Ok so to me the menu isn't anything special. Their ""Glam Burgers are meh- But their bread and butter is really good and I find myself not even ordering appetizers because the bread is soo tasty. Their pasta is pretty good. I normally get the shrimp fettuccine which is awesome and if your lucky enough to have one of their HOT male waiters than you'll even get the pleasure of having them personally hand grade the Parmesan onto your plate for you. And this doesn't really add or subtract from their overall rating to me, Buuuutt....I kinda have this thing where I like to have my food look presentable when it arrives. it kinda gives my food character. And there are a few dishes that they have that are presented in a beautiful way. But sadly a lot of the dishes come out looking like some slop that the angry lady from the high school lunch line through on your plate. I mean I don't think maybe adding a small garnish on the side of my Chicken Di Pana is asking to much. Especially considering I paid like 15 bucks for it!!! The alcohol is a hit or miss depending on who made your drink. overall, this place is nice to meet up with friends and have a good dinner and some drinks, every now and than, but I personally would recommend venturing over across the street to the P.F Chang's restaurant (their calamari is out of this world).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=340

This review is mainly for the service. On a mild Saturday afternoon where the restaurant was teeming with tourists, our server was on point. She gets four stars all by her lonesome. If you have at least six people and can't decide on an app, your only option should be the Factory Appetizer Favorites (creative name, I know). Don't believe the ""Four"" in the serves four or more suggestion. If it's for four, that's your meal.  Three servers came out with four separate plates piled with yummy goodness that is made of Avocado Eggrolls, Spinach and Cheese Dip, Pot Stickers, Summer Rolls (shrimp), Quesadilla (just cheese), Corn Cakes, Buffalo Blasts and Calamari.  The three year old at our table ordered fried mac and cheese. The adults ate most of it. Not because we're mean, but because it rocked. They were huge balls of ziti in a white cheddar cheese (not elbows and yellow cheese like I expected) fried and placed in a tomato (slightly creamy) sauce. Wow they're good.  If you're here, you're likely on vacation. Anywhere you go will be a substantial wait on a nice day.

Kristine R.,"Astoria, NY",298,363,1,4.0,4/24/2007,"Now that I live back in NYC, I pretty much avoid chain restaurants like the plague.  But back when I was in college in Towson, The Cheesecake Factory was the hot spot for us!  Who cares if we had to wait 30 minutes to an hour?  We needed to get our cheesecake fix!  Besides, it was a good excuse to come into Baltimore and hang out at the Inner Harbor.  I even had my 21st birthday dinner here.  No, we couldn't make reservations and we had to wait awhile to get a table for 12, but it was well worth it.  As an inexperienced drinker, I was excited to finally try some of their enticing mixed drinks and I wasn't disappointed.  Don't remember what I ordered exactly, but I do know it was tasty and 100% legal for me to order! So during our college reunion in Towson/Baltimore this past weekend, my friends and I decided that we *needed* to hit up The Cheesecake Factory for old time's sake.  We figured we'd avoid the dinner time rush and go later, so we got there around 10:30.  We still had a half hour wait!  This place really is a tourist trap, and a damn successful one at that!  They're open until 1am on weekends, which is probably a good indicator of just how busy they expect to always be. Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs that night.  Their menu is really extensive and pretty reasonably priced.  We ended up ordering three appetizers to share amongst the three of us - chicken potstickers, their version of crab rangoon, and spinach & artichoke dip.  The waitress left and we immediately reconsidered our decision not to order the New England Clam Chowder, a special.  So when she came back, we asked for 2 cups of clam chowder.  Okay, I don't know what dictionary they're using, but that clam chowder was in a BOWL.  Three of us could have easily split what was in there - and it was indeed a hearty chowder.  I sacrificed the last few spoonfuls of mine so I'd have room for the appetizers to come. The chicken potstickers were surprisingly flavorful.  I'm always wary of ordering Asian food in non-Asian establishments, especially when they're chain restaurants, but these potstickers were downright tasty.  The crab rangoon wasn't as good, but I'm happy to be eating any kind of crab whenever I'm in Maryland, and crab rangoon is hard to come by in NYC.  The dip was also pretty good, but we couldn't even finish it.  So yes, I concur that the portions are pretty big and very shareable. Our guts were literally stuffed, almost to the point of discomfort.  So we ordered a strawberry cheesecake to go and ate it in the hotel room that night.  As chain restaurants go, I think Cheesecake Factory is pretty good.  I think they do spend a lot of time honing their menu so it's not just a big selection of bland stuff.  And I think the cheesecake is pretty good, although not as good as Junior's in New York (I like mine to be a little more lip-smackingly thick).  So yeah, I'll admit it.  Whenever I'm in Baltimore (or at least the Inner Harbor), The Cheesecake Factory is still the hot spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=360

There are so many good restaurants around the Harbor that you shouldn't have to subject yourself to Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=360
Jessica L.,"Baltimore, MD",89,135,111,4.0,11/25/2007,"Ok I am not one to review chain restaurants unless something went way wrong or I was blown away.  I ventured here with my husband last weekend and was pretty satisfied with the food and service. I had the EVELYN'S FAVORITE PASTA - Penne Tossed with Broccoli, Oven-Dried Tomato, Roasted Eggplant, Peppers, Artichoke, Kalamata Olives, Basil, Garlic, Pine Nuts and Parmesan Cheese ( I suggest they had a bit more olives and artichokes).  Overall, it was very good and the serving was huge ( couldn't even finish it at home in one more seating). My Husband had the FARFALLE WITH CHICKEN AND ROASTED GARLIC -Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Carmelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce (this one was also VERyY good and huge). The bread they served to munch on before hand was warm and yummy.  We tried to figure out what he darker bread was but had no luck (anybody know?). For dessert we ordered 2 slices of FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE -Banana Cream Cheesecake Topped with Bavarian Cream and Fresh Sliced Bananas.  We ate one there and took the other one home and ate it the following day (still very yummy then also).  For the price for a slice you get a large serving.  If you aren't  a big whip cream fan tell the waiter because they put a lot on the plate. Our waiter was VERY busy but was also very attentive which I was very pleased with.  Next time I head back I will try a sandwich- they sounded GREAT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=360

Sometimes I have a identity crisis but this is menu is insane.   Service was efficently unfriendly, they provided me with my food and drink with a no frills attitude. I ordered a chopped salad for a starter. It was decent but not stellar, portions were very large which seems like the standard here. For my main I fiqured I would be safe with something they call their speciality a Cajun Shrimp Pasta. There was nothing special about this entree, The sauce tasted like a sweet spicy geletinous goo.

Kandis R.,"Silver Spring, MD",19,60,17,1.0,10/25/2016,"I came here with a friend for brunch on Sunday, October 23, 2016. We didn't have to wait at all, which was nice. We were greeted and seated right away. My friend ordered a mimosa and I had water. As we were sitting there conversing waiting on our food, a bus boy came by to clear the table next to us. He proceeded to take a rag and wipe all the food crumbs on the table right onto the floor, put two place settings on the table and walked away! It was at that point that we looked down and noticed that the floor under our feet was FILLED with food crumbs! I...can't understand why the food crumbs weren't brushed from the table into a bus tray or something. To have crumbs all over the floor under your feet while you're eating is disgusting! I can only IMAGINE what the kitchen looks like! As we sat and talked and waited for our food, we waited...and waited...and waited... We waited more than 30 minutes, almost 40 minutes for two brunch combos! We both ordered the same thing. The brunch combo consists of two pancakes, two eggs (prepared as you wish) and two pieces of bacon. I can't comprehend why it took that long to make essentially four pancakes, four eggs scrambled and four slices of bacon. Our server, while polite, never apologized for, nor addressed the wait. When we got the food...I mean...it was alright, nothing I couldn't have gotten from IHOP or even McDonald's for that matter. At least we would've spent less money and gotten faster service.

I've never seen a Cheesecake Factory so crowded before! Luckily we landed seats front and center of the bar, I was not going to wait that long.  Our bartender was very attentive and friendly, always refilling our water and asking if wee needed anything more. We had originally come for drinks but, they didn't offer happy hour on weekends and a Long Island was $10. We just stuck to an appetizer, the avocado rolls. The rolls were too heavy on the avocado and just too small, would have been better with some more bell peppers or an added texture. The sauce put a sweet twist on the otherwise bland rolls (docked half a star). They were not worth the $11 we paid though (docked a star). All in all, our bartender was wonderful and the appetizer was ok. I would only come here to order half priced drinks and apps during a happy hour or split a large entree for lunch or dinner if I was in dire need of good food.

Nikila D.,"Baltimore, MD",634,183,405,3.0,8/1/2012,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory on Otakon weekend, so all of us went in with our full cartoon/superhero/pop-culture costumes. Fortunately, half the restaurant was filled with Otakon-goers/tourists, so props to the staff for being accepting and accomodating about that! Our large group of around 12 came without a reservation and had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated, which was expected of the weekend and of the chain. However, when we were seated, we realized that the air conditioning seemed to be broken. Keep in mind this is a Baltimore summer evening, with the temperature being around 95 degrees, and all of us are in full body costumes... not pleasant. There were no other restaurants that were less packed in the area though, so we just had to deal with it. Our waiter seemed very flustered by the whole situation, and it took a while for him to get all of our orders down while separating the checks. It also took quite some time for the water to come to our table, which, complemented with the lack of A/C, was not the best impression. However, the food slightly made up for our uncomfortable situation. I ordered the The Incredible Grilled Eggplant Sandwich, which is two fluffy buns encasing eggplant, peppers, onion, and cheese, with fries on the side. It was on point. And HUMONGOUS. I actually had trouble figuring out how to eat it initially. I could taste all of the vegetables' flavors distinctly, and the garlic aioli brought out all the strong flavors even more. All of my friends were really pleased with their courses as well. For dessert, my friend and I split a Hershey's Chocolate Bar cheesecake, which was decent. I wasn't raving about it like my friends were about their cheesecakes, but it was a solid cake. Overall, this Cheesecake Factory location has great dinner dishes, good cheesecake, and mediocre service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=240

Cheesecake factory is in general a 4 out of 5 chain for me. The food is pricey, but the portions are large. The desserts are tasty, and that is basically why anyone with a clue would go there. This location gets only a 3 because the service left a bit to be desired. We waited a long time to get drinks, a long time to order, and a long time for things we asked for once our food came. It was a typically crowded Sunday evening, so maybe that had something to do with it. No big deal, but worth noting nonetheless. If you like cheesecake factory, go to this one. It tastes like, um, food from the Cheesecake Factory. Just sayin. If you like buffalo chicken dip, try the Buffalo Zinger thingies. It is buffalo chicken dip that is Battered and deep fried.

I didn't bother with the bread because it didn't look special.  We ordered some avocado eggroll appetizers that were recommended by our waitress, as well as the shrimp franchese and a BBQ salmon.  Of course we saved room for dessert--a dulce de leche cheesecake slice and the tuxedo cream one. Overall, I was impressed by the food (I was not expecting much since it was a chain).  The price is not too bad considering you get large portions.  The shrimp in my dish was cooked perfectly, even better than some supposedly nicer places.  The cheesecake tasted even better as leftovers because I was a little hungrier to enjoy it more. : ) Everyone was friendly and that made the evening even better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-baltimore?start=240

For 6 people we waited 1 hour and then were sat in a booth that only allowed for 1 highchair when we clearly asked for 2 when booking the table.  After our extremely busy server took our order we waited an additional 2 hours for our food. Mind you she brought us complimentary salads and offered other things to us. The kitchen was completely backed up and since we were sitting close enough we could hear every one (expediter mostly) yelling about every order. Plates were breaking left and right and other groups of people were getting food and desserts in the time it took us to get a first course.  The food was not up to Cheesecake Factory par maybe due to the influx of customers but I wasn't impressed with any of my food HOWEVER my sister got the Petit Filet and it was fantastic.

One thing I could not understand is why they only had about 8 umbrellas for 20 tables. It was hot and sunny and we had to wait for another table to get up in order to have an umbrella.

I enjoyed myself, but after 5 hours of walking in malls and the aquarium across the street, my stomach roared some hunger messages. So we decided to go here for dinner. Oy, the family didn't realize that getting a table on a Friday night is going to take forever, especially if there are 8 of us with a baby on board. So we waited for 2 and a half hours for a table, which was on par with what the hostesses up front quoted us for. So that was impressive. We got to our table, nice scenic area viewing the harbor. But it was chilly... I definitely felt the draft coming from the windows. They might need to patch that up. That was my only problem tonight, else it would be a fiver review. Had a Passion Fruit Mojito since I wanted something sweet that night. And it was presented nicely: not too sweet, which is awesome and had a nice garnish that complimented the drink. Made my night. Had their special shrimp app that our server told us about. It was alright, didn't really wow me, but had my cousin's avocado rolls and it was great! Sauce that came with the rolls was so tasty! Highlight of the night was the Ahi Tuna plate with rice cooked medium rare. For 22 bucks, it was totally worth it! It was such a portion, if I wasn't so hungry I would have saved some for home. But every bite of that fish, mixed with the white rice and sauce was too delicious. I recommend this plate, no doubt. Too full to endure any more, I decided to take the dessert home. It was the red velvet cake double layered between a modest layer of cheesecake with whip. It was just as amazing as it sounds. The place had the usual yet nice ambience with their other restaurants and it's nice. Our server (believe it was Alexandre?) was attentive and kept the table refilled and bussed.

Nothing inventive about the dishes. So at 2:30 went to Cheesecake factory, and even though there were a ton of people waiting outside for Unos, no line for Cheesecake Factory. On top of their regular menu, they gave us a special menu.  Also at lunch time there are lunch size portions that cost less. Those portions are still huge. We were seated near the outdoor patio that now had a plastic covering which means it was quite cold inside! Here's what we had: Avocado Eggrolls - I know everyone raves about them so we tried it. The eggroll was so deep fried it was crunchy and tasted like pork, must have shared the same oil as something else. Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - best thing ever! Thai Chicken Pasta - it was good, think Thai peanut noodles, however this was served with so much liquid it was almost a soup then topped with Fresh Bean Sprouts. I love bean sprouts but they should be cooked, not raw!  Also if I order the Thai Chicken Pasta without chicken, why did the waiter bring my plate and say ""Thai Chicken Pasta without the chicken""?

From no plates or silverware when the app came, to waiting forever for food to only be cold, overcooked and drowning in sauces or water. The manager was less than apologetic but perhaps he's numb to the complaints by now. Another issue was that the homeless folks and folks walking by just stroll in to use the restrooms and it was so filthy I wouldn't have let my dog walk in without a hazmat suit on.

Everyone liked their meals.  My wife filled up on a white pizza and says that she would get it again.  My kids really liked their bowtie pasta in alfredo sauce. My appetizer fresh vegetable salad was entree sized.  While the individual elements were good, I'm not sure the combination worked.  Apples with green beans?  With tomatoes?  I had the garlic rolls from the small plates menu, and they were really good - filled with cheese with a side of tomato sauce.  My quick decision to order the sweet corn fritters had a great outcome - they rocketed onto my list of favorite restaurant foods.  Leave it to Cheesecake Factory to make corn fritters into what is probably a 1000 calorie side dish - but they were excellent.
