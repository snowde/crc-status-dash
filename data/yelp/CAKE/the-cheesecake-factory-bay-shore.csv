Donald J.,"Copiague, NY",101,166,1270,3.0,10/20/2017,"It was my granddaughter's birthday and I asked her where she wanted to go to eat and she said let's try the Cheesecake Factory good choice.      We were seated right away when we got there and the waitress came over and took off appetizer order,we got the deep fried calamari that was cooked perfectly nice and crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.            I got the meatloaf special and that was very good very flavorful and moist and the mashed potatoes with gravy was also very good            Wifey got the mushroom burger that she said was very tasty and my granddaughter got the crispy chicken tender sandwich that was so huge she couldn't finish it but she said that it was slamming crunchy on the outside moist and flavorful on the inside.      The meal was so filling and that all of us had to skip dessert .             The only reason I didn't give them 4stars was because the waitress was very inattentive she was more interested in conversating with the other waitresses then seeing whether we needed anything else we had to ask the bus boy to get her a couple of times.  But otherwise I would go back because the food was very good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore
Claudia M.,"Bronx, NY",103,2,,1.0,12/17/2017,"This was our favorite restaurant in so many other locations. Love the lettuce wraps, salads and so many entrees! Today we decided to have appetizers for dinner especially the avocado rolls! We arrived, short wait time -perfect!  Sat at a booth which is ideal with kids and a party of four. We knew exactly what we wanted, avocado rolls, kids cheese pizza, taters and chicken nachos..... placed this exact order.... then the waiter came back to let us know that they were out of avocado rolls...  how?! So he provided a menu once again, because my daughter and I were craving avocado we ordered the burrito which comes with guacamole but because I can't have chicken I asked for it on the side, the waiter said he would put it in and come back with whatever was ready from our order... he returned to let us know that they couldn't have the chicken on the side because of the new way they are making the burrito! So once again... we look at the menu, order fish tacos... then the waiter comes back again to say that they had already made the burrito...  We patiently waited, our food came our son was very happy with his cheese pizza, my daughter loved the taters, the nachos had chicken on 5 pieces of nachos out of the entire plate.... the burrito was filled with rice... barely any veggies. There were some bites that were only rice and wrap!  It was all so disappointing, we should have gone elsewhere as soon as they said they were out of avocado rolls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore
Chris R.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,1,,1.0,9/2/2017,"Dirty restaurant, burnt food that was either dried out from heat lamps, or just overcooked and inedible. Horrible experience.  My wife and I didn't eat any of our entrée and the waitress didn't even ask why?  This place gives the cheesecake factory a bad name.  Messy bathrooms, that smell like urine. Greasy floors leading from the messy kitchen.  Managers laughing and talking by the bar while the place is going to hell.  I actually opened an account specifically to call out this mess.   They have another location in Huntington that is amazing go there.  I will never go back to this place and if they keep going in the direction they are I'm sure they won't last long!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore
Lava G.,"Coram, NY",154,13,15,3.0,1/2/2018,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory, but the food just wasn't up to par. Maybe it's just this location, not sure. We were seated right away even though it was busy for New Year's Day. The tables for 2 were WAYY too close to each other. No privacy, I could hear every word of the conversations sitting next to me on either side, bery distracting. We got the nachos as an appetizer and they were AMAZINGGG. Unfortunately our entrees were less desirable. I got the pasta carbonara and so did the two couples sitting next to us and we all agreed it was WAYYY too salty. My boyfriend got the chipotle pasta and it had a weird sweetness to it and it just wasn't that great. Desert was great as always. The service was amazing. The meal was just disappointing, reason I'm giving it 3 stars. So I'll probably come back & maybe just stay away from the pasta lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore
John M.,"Northport, NY",0,3,,5.0,1/10/2018,"This was our first time going to a Cheesecake Factory although the menu was a little overwhelming we had a wonderful experience. We went yesterday a Tuesday at around 6pm and we got seated right away and our waiter was very polite. As an appetizer we were recommended the avocado egg rolls which were great then for our entrees, I had the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp and my wife had a Jamaican shrimp they were both Delicious. Both the plates looked and tasted amazing the table besides us ordered an eggplant pasta dish that looked scrumptious, defiantly trying that next time. Overall had a wonderful experience and definitely coming again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore
Joanne P.,"North Babylon, NY",65,108,261,3.0,12/22/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! Their menu is so extensive it's impossible not to find something you'd like! And I especially love their skinny menu that includes skinny drinks! I got a skinny cosmo and I actually liked it better than a regular cosmo-you can tell there's less sugar but def not less flavor. My bf got some kind of fruity drink that was def sugar overload but still good-not sure what it was though. We split the Korean fried cauliflower and potstickers for appetizers. Surprisingly decent portion size since the cauliflower was on the small plates menu. They were not oily or salty at all, both were seasoned to perfection. For entree, I got the Mexican tortilla salad off the skinny menu and my bf steered away from his usual-chicken Marsala- and went with a special-chicken reisling. To this moment he regrets that! The dish was supposed to be chicken in a reisling wine sauce with pasta, mushrooms and bacon. First of all for a place known for its portion sizes, this dish was something off a kids menu...about a quarter of the size of a normal dish there especially in comparison to the volcano sized salad I got. The dish came with literally 4 slices of mushroom, not even a full mushroom and absolutely no bacon. When this was brought to the managers attention, he was dismissive and didn't seem to care at all, poor customer service. The waitress cared more than he did...he ended up sending out a side dish of mushrooms and bacon but since the portion was so small, my bf finished his dish before the side even arrived. I sampled it as well and thought it was bland anyway. My salad was excellent though & so big I brought half home for lunch. Our waitress Brittany was extremely friendly and attentive. Prices are decent and the restaurant is always clean, just disappointed in that one dish so we wouldn't try that again-stick to the basics next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore
Sharon J.,"Copiague, NY",9,106,317,4.0,10/22/2017,"I love cheesecake there are so many varieties here it is so hard to choose. My favorites are the lemon meringue & white chocolate macadamia, but let's not forget the plain. I had the mushroom burger with fotinina cheese & fries, hubby had meatloaf and mashed red potatoes with gravy my granddaughter had chicken breast with chipotle sauce. We all enjoyed our meals.

James L.,"Babylon, NY",1,6,,1.0,1/8/2018,This used to be our favorite place. Food is excellent and plentiful. Service is also excellent and I will never go there again. I was having an anniversary dinner when a gang of young adults were beating up on someone right outside the window. They were attacking some poor guy and I wondered if someone was to draw a gun or not. I never saw anything like this and am worried this might be a trend going forward. I called the manager just to vent and she was very professional but unable to help me and I clearly understand. I'll eat at the Huntington location in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore
Amanda F.,"Patchogue, NY",57,137,850,3.0,6/23/2017,"Cheesecake is always really good.  They have basically everything on their menu.  Cheesecake is delicious.  Portions are huge. Drinks are good.  Just pricey as we all know. That's why i only come here once in a blue moon.  I happen to like this location over smith haven.  The specialty i usually always get is the chicken madeira. it's so good, love the mashed potatoes.  Favorite cheesecake is Chris' outrageous, coconut cheesecake with brownie crust and pecan frosting.  YUMMMM.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore
Chris H.,"Dix Hills, NY",343,183,248,3.0,6/4/2017,"I applaud Cheesecake Factory for having a low- cal 'skinny' menu, however every time I get something from the healthy menu, the portion size is small. For example, the skinny chicken soft tacos were good, but I could have  eaten 10 of them. Skinny menu seems to be a euphemism for less food at the same price as the regular  menu items. So let's exploit the people who want to eat a light meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore
Jessica R.,"Bayport, NY",144,159,105,1.0,7/10/2017,"Where do I begin? Worst dining experience I've had in a very long time. Hostess' were so rude and catty. The host stand is the first and lasting impression of a business and having the girls myself and my family dealt with work the counter isn't a good idea. 1st girl: straight dirty blonde hair, about 5""4, makeup 2nd girl: plain Jane looking, dark brown hair, a little wavy in low pony tail My family (6) went out to celebrate my younger brothers birthday. It was a 25 min wait. Completely fine, its a Friday evening. We sat outside patiently with our buzzer device and enjoyed the weather. *Side note, the entire outside seating area wasn't active. All dusty and dirty couch cushions were over the outside seats.* The buzzer went off and we handed it in to one of the girls.  She couldn't even look up to take the device. I know it's not a big deal but eye contact shows consideration and respect, a quality every human being should possess, especially working in the service industry, food or retail.   The whole host stand had this aura that they were above their jobs and couldn't be bothered. I hate to be the bearer of bad news; however, you are working this job. If you don't like it, change it.  We stood around for about 7 minutes after handing in our buzzer device. Parties were being sat left and right, most parties whom handed in their devices after us.  I went up to the hostess stand and asked how much longer, to which I got a reply that I needed to hand in my buzzer. We already did, you idiot. We've only been a been a party of 6 standing right next to you. Hope you're never in danger because your spatial skills are just as bad as your superiority complex.  The three hostess' all looked at each other like they were about to shit their pants because clearly they messed up and gave our table away. A table we just waited for, for 25 minutes. They have their backs turned and are whispering to each other, while a waiter comes up and looks at me with like a grin on his face, as if he was bored and was looking for entertainment. They didn't feel bad, they didn't care.  Another worker comes up, asks if we are being helped, to which I said, ""yes, but I believe they gave our table away.""  You would have thought I just told one of the girls that she has 4 days to live. She whips her head around so fast, swinging her nothingness of a pony tail, practically cracking her neck better than a chiropractor on crack could do. She snaps, ""we did not give your table away! I'm trying to figure it out, so relax!""  Whoa. Girl. You are having a bad day, you are tense, and you need some milk.  I immediately said, that's fine but if you could update us on what's going on that's what I would appreciate. Then I asked for a manager.  A male came up and scurries us away. I tell him what happened to which he replies with nods and mhmms. No solutions, no apologies. Nice guy, not manager material. Asian male for whoever at this establishment reads this and wants to understand what happened. I asked the manager for the names of the girls and he told me he'd find out. Never did.  He sits us at a table that's barely cleaned off and completely not set. Doesn't apologize.  Male manager *fades out*  He never comes back. No follow up.  We don't have a waitress come up to us for 10 minutes. No plates, no water, no napkins, no silverware.  We are the rejects of the Cheesecake Factory.  A waitress passes, my mom yells excuse me very loud and asks her if she is our waitress. She says yes and she'll be right back. She should've done that already, passing our table at least 2 times since we sat.  Now we have a bad taste in our mouth to the entire dining experience.  The waitress comes up, Spanish descent, petite in height. She asks if she can get us something to drink and I interrupt her asking for the missing pieces to our puzzle, i.e plates, napkins, silverware. She comes back over 5 minutes later and puts everything in the middle of the table. Doesn't pass a single thing out. Takes our drink orders. Her responses were short and brash. Keeps saying, ""what does he want?"" about my brother at the end of the table with the same disdain in her voice.  I didn't want the sit down dining experience to ruin my brothers birthday dinner because the whole conversation amongst my family was about how horrible everything was. The waitress came over and I tapped her arm and said, ""Listen, I'm sorry about my attitude to you, but we had a horrible experience with being seated and it's not your fault."" She said it was okay and that she heard what happened. Although she said that she wants us to leave happy her attitude in the beginning certainly suggested otherwise. And I can't help but think that if I didn't break the ice, take the high road, and apologize that we would've had an all around horrible experience.  Won't be back to this location. Lack of responsibility from entire staff and catty, childish behavior.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore
Irina A.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,15,,1.0,11/18/2017,"The experience was very bad.

Sara B.,"Bay Shore, NY",47,94,21,2.0,8/7/2017,"Went the other day because I really wanted to try the limited edition Celebration cheesecake and to give it another shot after a terrible experience I had the last time I went. I will NEVER go to this location again. *Only reason I am bring my 1 star review to a 2 star is because our waiter was very good and very attentive*  My friend and I ended up sitting outside because it was a nice day. We ordered our drinks and an app. Drinks came out pretty quick but we waited over 20 minutes for the app. The waiter knew we were waiting a while and did apologize multiple times. He ended up holding on putting our dinner orders in because it was taking so long and he didn't want us to rush with our app. Probably not the best idea because we waited another 20 minutes for our dinner. My friend's dinner came out first and mine came out another 5 minutes later. All I ordered was the lettuces tacos, so I am not sure why this took so long. I had also ordered a meal to go for my boyfriend which took a while as well. It almost came to the point where we were going to cancel our meal orders because we got so filled up on the bread and app, but I felt bad because the waiter was very nice. In all we were there for almost two hours, most of the time just waiting for the food to come out Food was good, the usual Cheesecake Factory quality. The Pineapple Moscow Mule was amazing! Celebration Cheesecake, not worth it *whomp whomp* . Oh, and my chicken lettuce tacos came with one little piece of chicken in each taco -__- this has never happened at any other CF.

Marea P.,"Bay Shore, NY",3,11,22,5.0,6/16/2017,"Not sure why so many people bitch about this location. I've been many times, dine in, take out and curbside and have no complaints. I am super needy as a customer in general and my husband says I am  off the charts terrible, because I will always ask for 900 things changed and brought to me. That said, I also worked in food service and waitressed for years during college. I know what I expect.  This location does get busy AF Friday and Sat evenings. I can't attest to the rest of the week because I don't love the mall it's attached to (no inside mall entrance) so I don't come here constantly. There will be massive waits of 1 hour or more on those days for dinner, starting at about 4-4:30. After I had my son, I used to phone in and have food brought out to me (they have several designated spaces in which curbside is to park) and my order has never been wrong (I check before I leave because I know the drill). My husband has picked up for me and he sucks at checking, and still everything was correct. Food is always consistent and fresh. They have a massive menu and a skinny menu with delicious options, though smaller portions or somewhat tweaked for calories/fat, and a nice kids menu selection (salmon, pasta, sliders, plus usual kid selections). We went today, just left. I chose a non busy time, because I have a 2 year old and a pissy hungry husband. The hostess who greeted us was friendly, I asked for a booth and a highchair and she seated us at a massive 6 person booth, which I always love, and chatted w us.  Our server Vanessa was amazing. Super friendly, uniform impeccable, not a hair out of place, fast and efficient and brought me the usual infinity of extras I require (more bread, more butter, extra sauces, more ketchup, etc). Our server greeted us almost immediately and brought soft, warm bread and real butter. I was surprised to get the bread as we arrived at about 3 pm, so that's not something I expect so early, but was very nice to have and enjoy. It comes w one white and one wheat w oat. We kept it simple and ordered cokes and a milk w a lid. Glasses are enormous and soda was super fizzy just like I like. We asked to order the kids meal first while we looked at the menu, which was no problem. The kids pasta came out quickly and was cooked al dente (not that my kid would care, but I do), I requested it plain w the real butter packets on the side so I could control the amount added, which Vanessa remembered and brought right along w the pasta. She was very friendly w my child and laughed and cooed at him.  I ordered the Thai chicken wraps (regular app portion which is big enough for a meal. There is a skinny version of this plate also.) I asked for extra of every sauce. My husband got a turkey burger, extra cheese and fries ""no veggies don't even let a pickle touch my plate"". My husband's came out just as he ordered it. Mine came with its usual beautiful presentation and Vanessa immediately said ""I will be right back w all of your sauces"" and my husband indicated he would need much more ketchup. She brought everything quickly.  No dessert this time, but I always, always enjoy their key lime cheesecake and the pineapple upside down as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore

We were greeted and immediately seated in a big, comfortable booth for six...even though we were only two. The waitress was charming, and did not rush us to order. We were out to catch up, and enjoy a pleasant lunch. Delicious breads that were warm came immediately. Our waitress was a true professional, and took our order at a good time. I ordered a diet entree, which the menu listed at 370 calories. This meat, veggies, and mashed potato dish was sooo good. I almost licked the plate clean. My friend ordered a Thai dish that was served on lettuce leaves, and she knew the peanut sauce was the best. Forget the other choices. Had to resist the desserts. They were so delicious looking.

Although Crispy Cuban Rolls were on point, the Kobe burger which I ordered medium rare was well done & dry. We had already waited 30 min for our order to come out so I didn't ask for a replacement. My dog Phoenix will eat good tonight. The salad was soggy & wilted. No Good.  No dessert today.  6-12-2016 Wanted a late night snack & CCF has many delicious options to choose from. This night I chose an appetizer, salad & a piece of cheesecake.  Started with the Egg Roll Sampler. A mix of Avocado, Tex-Mex, & Cuban Rolls. My favorite being the Cuban rolls which tasted like mini Cuban sandwiches & came with a mustard dipping sauce. The avocado rolls would definitely make a good vegetarian option.   Next was my Greek Salad....not so good. Watery, lacked flavor & Cheese barely there.  The star of the night was the Dulche De Leche Cheesecake. Creamy sweet caramel goodness.  All of this was done through curbside service. Easy & convenient.

The ambience is very nice and the bar is well stocked. It's better to go in there for a game or lunch... I just feel like this place doesn't pack the punch it should when it comes to dinner.

Cindy T.,"Clinton, CT",240,178,437,4.0,9/25/2016,"My boyfriend & I went there for dinner on Friday evening September23rd,2016. We got there probably around 9:30pm & the place was extremely busy. They have not been to a Cheesecake Factory in many many years. They have a very large extensive menu. You can get breakfast items all day long which is wonderful! They serve bread as soon as you arrive. He had been their for his 1st time the weekend before w/ his kids for one of daughters birthday... so he decided to order the same thing The Smokehouse BBQ Burger. Course it took me quite a while to decide what I wanted I went back & forth debating between many things. I ended up on a cheeseburger and instead of getting french fries you can get a side salad at no extra charge. You can tell that the cheeseburgers are made fresh they're not frozen. They offered to bring you more bread if you want it we declined. We didn't wait too too long but it was probably 15 minutes since everything is made fresh. The burgers were absolutely delicious! They were humongous as well and I had asked to have the tomato & lettuce on the side which they did do & the burgers were cooked to the way they were ordered. Of course I can only eat 1/2 of mine & took the other half to go. And ordered cheesecake to go I ordered the Oreo cheesecake. I had an unsweetened iced tea & he had 2 Heinekens. The bill came to about $52.00 Our waitress was very nice but a bit flighty. Overall very good experience. Another good thing is they have smaller portion menu people who may be on a diet for don't want such a large portion when ordering the Lord's dinners for specialty meals. He couldn't believe the size of some of the meals I saw were coming out. Since you're not sitting in a booth the tables for 2 are very close to each other. The restaurant people I say they probably have at least 15 waitstaff on & 2-3 people greet & seat people. Saw several busybody plus they have people who work behind the take-out area for people coming in just to purchase cheesecake. They also have tables outside for eating. But when we came in at that time they were closing down that area.

I have usually enjoyed my experience here, but upon my visit with some coworkers recently I was let down. I'll give it two stars because the chicken lettuce wraps were light and delicious. One of the people in my party was served a dirty glass. Another person in my party asked for Splenda and a knife immediately when we got there, only to ask twice more and the Splenda and knife to finally arrive when we were already having appetizers. We were the only party in the entire restaurant. I had the Steak Diane and Herb-Crusted Salmon combination. It was a nice portion and the dish was okay.

I have never been to this location before but I had shopping to do, and The Cheesecake Factory was convenient right next to the mall. For a Friday at 7pm I was seated within 10mins and we were quickly greeted by our waiter. I love the Cheesecake Factorys bread that they give, it is different and yummy, well after sitting for some time we see everyone with bread baskets. Especially our waiter bringing them to his other tables. Drinks and appetizers came out.

A colleague and I came in for lunch and we waited forty-five minutes for beverage orders to be taken, we ended up ordering the food to go as we didn't know how long it would take to come out.  On another occasion, my fiancé had ordered a steak medium rare and it came out well done and over cooked.  The waitress' response was they don't cook steak medium rare, it's up to the cook.  For ordering take out, the staff says it'll be twenty minutes - on four separate occasions I've waited in excess of an hour for two Items.  When calling to place the order, one typically ends up on hold for ten minutes.

Jude R.,"Bay Shore, NY",17,191,32,3.0,9/29/2015,"I struggled a bit with the rating, but ultimately settled on a 3 overall.  Here's why: Restaurant:  2 Stars:  Location is new and looks well maintained.  Unfortunately both place settings were dirty with food particles stuck to silverware and greasy flatware.  I find this disgusting and almost left at this point.  This is just sloppy customer service. Server: Brianna - 5 Stars:   Service was prompt, efficient and courteous while not rushed.  Brianna also offered honest suggestions with a sense of humor. Food:  3.5 Stars: The food was well prepared and served hot.  My wife really enjoyed the burger and the gluten free bun.  It was cooked well done but not DEAD!  The coffee was hot but very bland and the first cup was clearly stale (at 12:00pm).  I had the Cuban, and while it was fresh and very well made, the taste was overwhelmed but a far too heavy hand with the yellow mustard.  This took away from what could have been a great sandwich.

Matthew A.,"Brightwaters, NY",78,44,33,2.0,4/30/2015,"The cheesecake factory is difficult for me to put a finger on. It's overtly commercialized - they are everywhere,  and they have ADS on their MENU for crying out loud. It's expensive for a chain restaurant, but the menu is large and it's almost always quite good.   My original thought was that it's a place that hires cooks (I wouldn't venture to say chefs) that give a crap about what goes on the plate and pay attention to detail.   That all went to hell when I came to this location. I'll spare the description of decor or ambiance - almost everyone knows it. If you don't,  picture a hotel bar mixed with a casino buffet. This place is huge,  it has to easily sit 100 at a glance,  and the kitchen looks tremendous. Staff is running about everywhere and everyone was reasonably nice.  Here's the thing though,  keeping in mind what I said before about good food and consistently prepared by people who care.  We ordered nachos with spicy chicken,  normally quite good but this time temperature inconsistent in a strange way. As if it was baked in an unevenly heated oven. Some chips burned some cold,  some cheese melted some congealed.  I ordered chicken teriyaki which came as a split chicken breast -  which is fine although not described as such -  it also came with pineapple slices brown rice and what seemed like grilled bananas - which was a nice surprise and all welcome additions. The chicken however? If I had to hazard a guess based on my own experience that thing hit 190 degrees before it was pulled out. In other words,  very,  very overdone and tough.  Steak Diane at the table ordered medium was well done to the point of being difficult to cut. Jamaican shrimp was the only thing cooked decently but it was haphazardly doused in an overwhelming large amount of sauce that while good,  made us wish we had a water bath for the shrimp because it was so overpowering.  The cheesecake was of course,  delicious,  although at $8 a slice it better be.  Service was OK. Nothing to write home about,  didn't always have drinks,  didn't check up on us,  but the timing worked so it didn't bother us too much.  So,  at least here the cooks don't know what's going on. Maybe you can chalk it up to growing pains but it absolutely irks me to no end when people get simple things like properly cooking or dressing your dish. That's the EASY part. Ladle less sauce,  use a meat thermometer if you're unsure. It's not rocket science. It reeks of laziness.  If if I go to Applebee's, Fridays or some other forgettable restaurant and I'm paying $20 for an app and two entrées then I'll be more forgiving with preparation. But when I'm paying $20 for a chicken breast or $25 for cubed steak at least have the decency to cook it correctly.  I expect more from cheesecake factory. I wince at writing this and giving them two stars,  because I've had considerably better experiences at other locations,  and consistently so, but at every turn I was not happy here so I have to tell it like it is.  I'd avoid this particular location for a season or two until they get their quality control in order and their cooks learn how to do what they were hired to do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=40

Ross H.,"Kaneohe, HI",79,23,,1.0,6/28/2017,"Oh man hold on to your hats, this is gonna be a good one.  Birthday week for mom, so decided to go to Cheesecake Factory for the 3rd dinner of the week. Stoked. Wife loves cheesecake!   Got there, was told it would be a 15 minute wait for 7 adults, 3 kids. No problem. Waited about that long and got sat. This is at about 7:30-745pm (10/28/17 Wednesday) so the place is not super busy. Server comes and takes our drink order and then brings our appetizers, drinks, and bread. Forgets a couple kids drinks and water. No big deal. Ask for it when our server comes back, but then is MIA for a good 10+ minutes.  Finally comes back with water and bread and takes our food order. MIA again for another chunk o' time.  Food comes out, one order has fries instead of salad, no problem. Beer order takes a bit longer than usual. Even worse, mom had to wait for 5-10 minutes for an extra plate we requested twice since she was just sharing. Asked once from the server when we ordered and another time from the runner.  Listen, I was a server at multiple spots and know how ""wonderful"" the job can be. So, I pull our food runner, yes we have lost track of our server again, and ask him if our server is new. He responds with, ""she has 3 sections of tables so she's in the weeds now"". Ok that sucks. Now I'm mad at the managers because not once did I see them throughout dinner. Yeah she could have said she was slammed and apologized, but instead chose the ""out of sight"" strategy.  As we finished up (food was actually really tasty!) now our server comes back, gives us boxes and bags, clears the table, brings our check, and takes the check to run it. All of a sudden I'm seeing our server every time I turn my head. How convenient.  Oh, I almost forgot. My mom got a scoop of vanilla ice cream for her birthday. Not cheesecake. From the Cheesecake Factory. One, because they're apparently very cheap. Two, we couldn't be bothered to order one since we didn't have a server. Could've ordered more drinks too, but then again, would have needed a server with a normal amount of tables. Oh, we did get a, ""no cheesecake?"" question, but by then it was too late.  The kicker for this entire story? What? There's more? Yes. Yes there is.  My friend eating with us asked to speak to a manager, she was told they were in the kitchen and went there to find them swiping through photos on their phone. Got a lot of ""we're sorry"" and even better, ""where were you sitting?"" A half empty restaurant with managers not even walking through seeing how their servers, and more importantly, how their customers were doing is pretty ridiculous.

As far as authenticity it could have been more of a Korean American fusion dish since I'm not sure Korean culture makes fried chicken sandwiches (or do they?).  For dessert my bestie and I split a red velvet cheesecake. Yumm!! We ate so much food that afternoon that we skipped dinner.

He did forget to bring bread after he asked us twice if we wanted it and a table of a party larger than us had their order taken and their appetizers well before we got ours.  For appetizers we got the Buffalo chicken blasts, the loaded potato tots, and the portobello-zucchini-avocado fries. All of the appetizers were delicious. Portions were very large for the price. And they were all piping hot when they arrived. The dipping sauces for the fries were excellent and their blue cheese dressing was superb.  Now here is where things get a little dicey. It took me about 15 minutes to finally decide what to order for my entree. You're probably thinking it's because there's a million things on the menu and that's only half true. The other reason is because I am making a commitment to be eating this meal at least 3 times due to the massive (and much appreciated) portion size. So I landed on the chicken and biscuits. A few moments later our waiter came by to break the news that they were all out of chicken biscuits. I was shocked because that's never happened to me before at a Cheesecake Factory. But I picked the farfalle pasta without tomatoes as my entree instead.  Our appetizers were still on our table when our food arrived. There was no room to move. There were also all our dirty dishes and cutlery that needed to be removed before eating our entrees. That was pretty annoying to be honest. I feel like our waiter spent more time with other tables and paid no attention to ours.  When my entree hit the table I immediately noticed there were tomatoes. I asked for the waiter to bring the menu over again as he told me he'd have the kitchen ""pick out the tomatoes"" for me. I didn't want anyone handling my food that way. If it wasn't a big deal to me I would have eaten around it but the way he said it was so off-putting.  The manager then came over to check in on me. I didn't complain. I just started that I wanted to pick a different meal since they didn't have the entree I first chose. He immediately gave me a look of concern and asked which meal I had initially ordered. He went to the kitchen and had them prepare me the meal I wanted and was so nice in the process.  Finally after most of my table was finished with their meal mine arrive. I was very pleased with my food but I hated having to eat while everyone was already finished.  We ordered 2 cheesecakes to go and I wrapped up my food. We paid and left. The whole process of this meal took about 2 hours. It was far too long and unnecessarily complicated. But I do love the Cheesecake Factory and I'd come to this location again because the management was so thoughtful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=60

Second attempt, 15 mins, which was reasonable, so here we go..  Huge menu, very diner-esque with unique & interesting dishes sprinkled throughout. The food was excellent, especially considering this is a franchise chain. Will definitely be back! The dessert menu is just as huge - 35 types of cheesecakes, PLUS a few other goodies. Our excellent server Britany advised us to choose by type of cheesecake we liked - creamy, or more like a drier, firm consistency.. We're creamy lovers, The Snickers Bar Cheesecake was outrageous!!  Would be solid five star if the wait times were more reasonable..

The decor is similar to other locations but slightly different. I have to say our waitress Victoria was just so sweet and had really great knowledge of what was good. Dealing with my aunt who can be very indecisive (yet adorable and cute) when it comes to ordering, can be a challenge on the patience of a busy waitress. Her handling of my aunt and her million questions followed by a story was perfect, and we were able to get an order in record time  (for this pack of ladies) One of the suggestions she made was to try the sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo which the sound of made me like ughh..but she said ..""no trust me try it I ate them for dinner last night in fact I eat them every chance I get thats how good they are""   I found this very funny and I did what she said. Man they were so good I had a mouth gasm. Really though...I would never pick that for myself. Everything else came out in a very timely fashion and was all cooked perfectly. My lunch entree was herb crusted salmon (13.95) and it was great. My aunt said her grilled salmon was the best salmon she has ever eaten. I have to say that of all the chain restaurants this place is definitely winning the race. The prices are all competitive to the other places in its category and the food is so good so for what it is at this particular location, it deserves 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=60

What I like about this location is that they text you when your table is ready (not sure if the Smith Haven mall location does it, haven't been there since this one opened) so that you can walk around the mall until your table is ready. My favorite appetizer is the fried macaroni and cheese but I really love macaroni and cheese so it's hard for me to not like it. Two things I wasn't crazy about were the cajun jambalaya pasta and Chris' outrageous cheesecake which is like brownie, chocolate cake, and coconut-pecan but it was just too much and I felt like the flavors didn't mesh well together.

I know that the Cheesecake Factory does want you to be overly friendly as a server but I really hate it. My last visit I saw a server pouring alcohol from the bottle into his mouth behind the glass window thing where the server stations are.

I had only ordered the crab cake appetizer and a salad. My salad came with no dressing whatsoever. I don't really blame it on this poor waiter.

Nicole K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,,1.0,1/4/2015,"I'd like to start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of cheesecake factory, having been to over ten different locations and receiving nothing but amazing food and service. My experience pertains to this Bay Shore location only and I would highly recommend any other location as one of my favorite restaurants.  I went out for a dinner with my friend last night and waited almost two hours, which of course was our choice. Upon getting seated, we waited quite a long time for someone to come over. Our server who wasn't particularly friendly took our order and never brought the usual bread. Our food came suspiciously quickly. (before the bread so we had to ask for it to eat with the meal out of order)....like 5 minutes quickly and made me feel like it was sitting under a food lamp or something weird. Boy was I right. After my friend had eaten half of her food, she pulls out a GIANT CLOTHING TAG that says ""Made In China"" that was mashed in with the potatoes! Seeing as this is one of the worst things that could happen at a restaurant short of a bug in your food, we thought the management would be taking it seriously. Our server blamed the kitchen, apologized and then we waited an unbelievable 30 minutes for a replacement. You would have thought this would be a priority to fix but no one cared. A manager came over and gave us a ""Guys I'm so sorry"" then never followed up once we got our replacement! You would think he would personally bring it out and that this would be customer service 101.... We then made friends with the table next to us who waited almost an hour for their food and then was brought the wrong dish 3 times in a row. She asked a manager for some cheese and then he never came back with it. We both thought it was a joke that night because everyone around us had everything possible going wrong. When we ordered dessert, no forks so we had to ask and wait again. Then our server came over and actually asked us if the manager said he would comp just the meal or the meal and the dessert! Um wouldn't you ask him directly? I absolutely couldn't believe that she asked us that and then had the nerve not to take the dessert off when we said he never mentioned anything about the bill.  I probably wouldn't have written this review if they had recovered properly with good customer service, follow up and compensation but that just was not the case. Now i""m left wondering what happens in that kitchen that allows clothing tags to fall into food. Their back of house operations are not on their feet and I would never come back here, though I feel if they get proper guidance and training, in a few months they may be able to work out the kinks.

At first i was greeted by the girls in the front who looked so confused. I told them we were a party of 5, they continued to stare at the computer but finally a blonde girl spoke up staying the wait is only 10 minutes handed me a pager and a menu and told me to have a seat and they let us know when the table is ready. When our pager went off at exactly 10 minutes, I went right up to the blond girl and handed her my pager she told me that a host will be right with me.

Cheesecake should make sure all the hires are like her.  When we finally sat outside, we were waiting for our waitress for a while. I wanted to sit outside because the furniture is so comfortable but I was getting annoyed with the lack of service. I sent my child in to ask the blonde where our waitress was. She said she would send someone over. Within a minute the manager came over. A very young red head, she greatly apologized for our missing waitress and said she'd be happy to take our drink order and get us some bread. When she came back with drinks and bread I told she we're ready to order but still haven't seen our waitress. She apologized again and told us that she was going to take care of us.

I explained to the manager our service issues and not once did he apologize or offer a solution, instead he explained he never brought the bread out because it was cold, so I told him I would just like the check and the food would no longer be necessary.

Bottom line - a great addition to the Bay Shore restaurant scene.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80
Denise M.,"West Islip, NY",0,30,1,4.0,4/18/2015,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory at this location 5 times now. One time during the week for dinner, and 4 times for lunch. We tried one time to get in for dinner and were given a 3 hour wait. We ended up going elsewhere and were home watching tv when we got texted that our table was ready, lol.  The decor in this restaurant is very nice. Although I am not fond of how close some of the tables are next to each other. Sometimes there's not enough room to stretch out, and you feel like you are invading your neighbor's conversation if you look their way, since the seating is so close. The waiter are pretty attentive. The ones that I've had were pretty knowledgeable about the menu, and if they didn't know they went quickly to find out. The server also commented on choices or things that would go well together. Since I like to order some small plates, that was helpful for me. The food was delicious every time I had visited. Its fun seeing how its presented, and the flavors just pop in your mouth. Save room for cheesecake. I usually don't have any room, but sometimes I take a few slices home to share with the hubby and kids. We get a few different ones and enjoy them all.  I am so happy with this new location. However, I would really like to be able to have dinner here without the long wait. At the time I tried they had no reservations because they were too new. That was the reason for one star off. A place like this needs to take reservations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80
Amanda C.,"Bay Shore, NY",148,13,,5.0,12/6/2015,"My boyfriend and I just love this place! We have both ordered out several times and have dined in. Some of the other reviews about lack of healthy portions baffle me. It's always more than enough and we can't finish our meal. Everyone is super friendly and the food is always delicious. Our server tonight , Travis went above and beyond and was constantly at our table attending to us even though the place was packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80
Beth L.,"Bellmore, NY",278,556,475,4.0,1/9/2015,"If you think this place is expensive you're an idiot. Its CCF they all open on time and the Vanilla Bean cheesecake is on point. Sara is the best server by far there. Hope it doesn't go downhill like the Westbury location did.

Joann F.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,25,,5.0,10/25/2016,One of my favorite places to eat! Love their trimosui cheese cake they have.  Their grilled chicken cesar salad and American bbq burger is great there.  Never had an unpleasant experience at this location.  Waits are to be expected during weekends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80
Tomeka R.,"Bay Shore, NY",11,7,,2.0,1/18/2015,"Let me start this review by saying, I have been to several Cheesecake Factories and Grand Lux Cafes for brunch and have never been disappointed until today. The service here is awful!!  We were seated for over 20 min before we were even offered water. The table next to me waited even longer. There were a bunch of waiters just roaming around talking to each other and not paying attention to the customers at all.  When we were finally waited on, the waitress had no real knowledge of the brunch drink options. It took several tries before we could get a drink. However, the food was very good.  Not saying I would never come back to this location, but certainly isn't at the top of my list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80
Miss Y.,"East Islip, NY",15,86,15,4.0,1/8/2015,"Normally I don't go for chain restaurants, seriously they are just over priced and everything comes in pre mixed - no bueno.  However, the Cheesecake factory is fantastic, I am obsessed with the large menu and I try to have something new every time.   The staff at this location is great - love the bartenders Matt was a sweetheart and I wish I remembered the girl that was there right before him same shift because she was also awesome.  As were both of them with drink making.   Buffalo bites are a MUST try if you like spicy food, there are many of them so if you're not sharing they better be your meal.  Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta is very good, as is the Chicken Costaletta (probably spelling it wrong) burgers, and pretty much everything I have tasted there lol.  If you have not been, you should go.  I don't really like sweets so Cheesecake isn't my thing but the caramel macchiato is on point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80
Mary Y.,"Reston, VA",49,36,75,4.0,6/13/2015,"Darn right I'm a fan! A friend of mine had never been to Cheesecake factory before so I made the choice that she must go and had to have the avocado eggrolls. Well mark down one more fan. lol  We basically had drinks, appys and cheesecake. I left feeling so stuffed that I wasn't sure if I'd fit behind my steering wheel. (I did) We were hoping to sit outside but there was a wait and we got seated right away inside. The waitress was lovely and very friendly. It was very enjoyable all around, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was that I ordered a burger to go for my dad and it took forever to get. We will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80

Jonny B.,"Old Westbury, NY",1,23,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Beyond pissed Went here for a birthday party and the service was non existant. The waitress came to take our parties order and she was pilled out and dizzy. She then disapeared for 25 minutes. While waiting 25 minutes for our drinks alone we were unable to not leave the silver ware unnoticed that still had food from the previous customers meals still attatched to the forks and knives. It was undeniable how disgusting and filthy this resteraunt was. Had the board of health came in this place would be condemned and closed up til they could get up to code. The food came out and was cold like it had been setting under heat lamps. Needless to say everyone was sick, even the persons birthday. So much for a special day. They get one star cuz well after all they refunded our money but our special day was ruined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80
Ruby W.,"Massapequa, NY",1,40,,1.0,6/23/2016,"I'd give this location zero stars if possible. After being seated 10 mins had to ask manager for a waitress. Had to ask busboy for napkins, they never arrived. Waited 15 more mins for bread. Brought the order and it was wrong. Never came back with the right food. Waitress never came back to check on us. My husband ate his dinner and I left starving after an hour waiting for a salad that never arrived.  Manager offered food to go. Not eating a salad while in the car. Dont bother. Really awful experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80

This also came with little chunks of mango,parsley & onions! For my appetizer I had baked macaroni and cheese(lovely).

Bill M.,"West Sayville, NY",0,2,,3.0,9/11/2016,"Overall dinner was good. I had the Bang bang chicken and shrimp. Tasted great. The only issue was the cleanliness of the shrimp. Of about six shrimp, three of them were improperly deveined.  They tried but they obviously missed. The manager apologized and had some more shrimp cooked but I have the feeling he did not go back and actually tell his staff of the problem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80

I figured we'd give it another chance but nope, the same crap as last time. We saw our waitress twice. The table had no knives, no ketchup for the fries. 2 pats of butter. Had to wait too long for our dinner.  Still waiting for the check .... Yawn....  Forget about a second cup of coffee.... Omg our experience was awful... NEVER AGAIN!

Toni B.,"Islip, NY",0,3,,1.0,5/11/2015,Let me start by saying that I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory and usually dine at the one by the smith haven mall. So I was ecstatic when one came to Bay shore.  This review is strictly pertaining to bay shore location.   We got take out and I ordered the chicken and biscuits which I usually love (even though it's packed with calories lol)  I was super disappointed that when i open it there was NO BISCUIT. Hello it's chicken and biscuits!!???  Then my carrots were pretty much raw and the worst offense was I took a bite of what seemed to be microwaved mashed potatoes because they were stiff and gross and I had to pull a 3 inch piece of Saran Wrap (plastic) out of my mouth. Are you kidding me!!!!!!????  How can one dish get any worse?!  I called management and all he seemed to apologize for was the fact that I didn't get a biscuit!  How's about almost choking on plastic wrap! Ugh  or having to pull that out of my mouth !  I was so disgusted.  He refunded the meal and the two pieces of cheesecake but I don't feel that was sufficient anyway. He did offer to make me a new one and I could pick it up but no thanks. I don't want any food from the same chefs that made that meal.  Don't they care at all??? 3 offenses on one plate.  Unacceptable  Worth mentioning was one time me and my bf dined in and he pulled a long hair out of his pasta. Not even kidding.  They offered him a new dish but he lost his appetite and didn't even want cheesecake after that.  They did refund the dish    We go here because we like ccf usually and want to eat the food. Not get refunds for dishes that are inedible.   Will not be retuning to this bay shore location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80
Candi A.,"West Islip, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/28/2017,"This location is my least favorite, always a disappointment.  The aggravation starts upon entry...the staff quotes a time that is far from correct.  On my most recent visit I was quoted an hour wait time.  I asked if this was accurate and was told yes.  After an hour, they just keep telling you 10 minutes until 1 hour 40 minutes passes.  The wait doesn't end here...my daughter waited another 20 minutes to get a glass of cranberry juice because we were told it has to come from the bar.  The juice actually had to be returned because it had a terrible taste, but was still on our bill at the end of the meal.  The aggravation continued as we waited for our favorite zucchini sticks only to be told after waiting for them for a while that they are out of zucchini today.  Bread was finally brought out after about 30 minutes.  My advice...stay home!  If you must go, eat before you leave home and have an open mind in case your favorite foods are out of stock!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80
Cw P.,"Central Islip, NY",0,9,1,4.0,7/30/2016,"I love The CheeseCake Factory, service and all, the only downside of it is that I can't go on a normal one hour lunch brake and expect to get back to work on time. It's not the service, most of the waiters are very attentive and friendly, get your drinks very quick along with the bread, but I have had issues a couple of times with the amount of time they take to prep your food. Anytime you plan to go, my personal suggestion would be to show up knowing that you will be there for AT LEAST one hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bay-shore?start=80
