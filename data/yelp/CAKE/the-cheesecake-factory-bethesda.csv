LaShawna S.,"Sterling, VA",46,84,250,4.0,12/9/2017,"I couldn't decide if i would them 3 stars or 4 stars but i went with 4. This was my first time at this location and my office had our holiday lunch here! I made the reservation for 12:45. Well first let me say, when i called to make the reservation i asked if they took reservations and the guy said No! Then i said 'even for large parties' and he said, well for large parties then YES. He should have said that bc if I hadn't asked further we wouldn't have made reservations.  Fast forward to the date, several folks arrived early and they told them the reservation had been changed to a different time. I was confused bc they called the day before to confirm so who would have changed the time? I called them on my route but they said i called them at noon to change the time which i hadn't!!! At first i thought maybe my boss had called bc we have similar names but she said she hadn't either?? Either way, they were able to seat us outside on their ""outside patio"" which is in the hall of the mall. But It worked out bc we could hear each other opposed to being inside the restaurant where it was very noisy! Bottom line everyone enjoyed themselves at our lunch! The food was good and of course the dessert was yummy so i will visit this location again! **smiles",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda
Kay S.,"Frederick, MD",4,39,52,1.0,10/30/2017,"I ordered 4 slices of Cheesecake to-go. The server, Saul, started by saying ""gimme a second alright"", with a rather curt attitude. But, I give a pass for that because it WAS very busy and I'm sure he was overwhelmed. I can understand that. THEN he took my order by saying  ""what do you want""....ummmm not exactly the friendly Nature i'm used to getting from the day staff at other locations. I ordered and paid. Then I politely pointed out that the next available slice of pumpkin pecan was missing the pecan portion in the center, and I didn't want to get served that piece. Saul snapped at me....and said ""what"". Then said ""ya ill take a look at it"".  He pulled the tray out and muttered ""not a big deal"", but clearly a huge chunk was missing like from a previous serving spatula grabbing it. He grabbed a tissue and plucked the piece off the tray and plated it and put it in the cooler! Some other poor sap was going to get ripped off!   Then he proceeded to grab the next slice and throw it in a container....literally, dropped it from about 8"" above the counter.  I consider myself a CCF connoisseur, so i KNOW that he shouldn't have even been packing the cheesecake. There are dessert staff behind the counter that tray and top the slices and the server usually packs them in the to go bag. I got annoyed and started texting my husband .....HUGE mistake to take my eyes off my food. A few minutes later, saul slides my bag across the counter. He used a brown paper bag, which cant hold 4 slices well, i shouldve known that, but it didnt dawn on me. I saw no silverware and asked ""can i get some silverware"". Saul replied.... ""whatcha want?""  Then grabbed forks without me responding and said ""forks good"" and threw them on top of the bag.  At that point, I just left. What a terrible experience.  BUT THIS IS THE INFURIATING PART: i live 55 minutes away. I got home and pulled the slices out of the bag.  THE CONTAINERS WERE TOSSED IN THE BAG LOPSIDED!!!! Three of the slices were smashed against the side and broken in middle. I had to scrape the sides of the containers to get the cheesecake and frosting out. Complete sham.  Needless to Say I will never NEVER go back to that CCF. I will eat cheap, thin, stale cheesecake from a gas station before spending another penny at that CCF!! Not to mention it ruined my whole celebration.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda
Dee R.,"Gaithersburg, MD",38,22,,5.0,10/29/2017,Our server Chase was amazing! 10 STARS FOR CHASE!  We took our buddy out for her birthday and he really made it a great and special occasion.

Lina T.,"Chevy Chase, MD",295,235,828,3.0,6/20/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location is conveniently located inside of Montgomery Mall.  I came here on a Sunday evening around 7pm with my fiance and his family. We waited about 15 minutes and then we were walked to our seat.... then the waitress had us walk all the way back to the waiting area because the table was not cleaned up yet -_- We then waited another 5 minutes and then we were finally seated. I was craving their Tuna Salad, but they were completely out.... how disappointing -_- I was surprised that they were out of the tuna at 7pm, but I ended up ordering Skinnylicious Soft Tacos with Shrimp (480 calories). I love how their menu includes the calories for each menu item, it is great for those who want to be conscious of their caloric intake... especially since Cheesecake Factory is known for their hugeeee, often unhealthy, portions. I enjoyed the tacos, nothing amazing, but still good. At $15 it was pricey in my opinion. It comes with avocado, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and shrimp served on soft corn tortilla shells. The avocados were fresh and the shrimp were perfectly cooked. The entree also comes with a Escabeche Salad, pretty much pickled veggies. The salad was average, kind of too sour for my taste, but I did like that it was different from your typical salad.  The waitress was nice and our food came out in a timely manner. The only hiccup of the night was the seating situation... not the end of the world, just a nuisance. There are multiple parking lots, parking should not be an issue. My biggest recommendation would be to either make reservations or anticipate waiting because this place is always busy, no matter what time of day or day of the week that I have been here :P",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda

Yumi M.,"Chevy Chase, MD",42,107,102,2.0,10/26/2017,"My husband and I were extremely disappointed at this Cheesecake Factory last night. We have been coming to this location ever since it moved from the White Flint Mall location.  Last night, we came here around 9:30pm, the restaurant was not busy and seemed like they had ample servers still working. We were seated immediately, and our server took our drink order. However, he did not ask us if we wanted any bread, and never brought out any of the bread. After waiting for 20 minutes (he had already taken our orders at this point), I asked him to bring us out some bread, and he finally did but the bread was cold! Bread here has always been warm, at least luke warm, but last night, the bread was just cold. Our order also took around 20-25 minutes to arrive even though the restaurant was NOT busy. Not sure what the deal was there, but we have never had to wait that long even during busy hours. Then, we order a slice of cake and we definitely noticed a decrease in size. I am not sure if this is something that the corporate has changed recently but we were incredibly surprised. It seemed that they were trying to fill the plate with whipped cream instead.  I have been a cheesecake factory regular probably since 2012, but last night was definitely one of the least pleasant dining experience. Not sure if this was a one time thing, but next time I hope that the service will be how it was before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda
Samantha L.,"Potomac, MD",1910,1022,9453,4.0,5/8/2017,"Before running our mall errands, we had lunch at  Cheesecake Factory. Our server Zeny was hospitable.  For appetizers, we shared the Avocado Eggrolls, which consisted of three egg rolls stuffed with avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion, and cilantro deep fried in a crispy wonton wrapper, served over crispy vermicelli with a sweet tamarind cashew dipping sauce. Instead of getting his usual, my dad ordered the  Chicken Riesling, which consisted of tender chicken breast sautéed with mushrooms, bacon, onions, and garlic in a slightly creamy white wine riesling sauce. I believe that the pasta tasted better with the same sauce as opposed to the butter parmesan sauce. My mom ordered Skinnylicious Chinese Chicken Salad, which consisted grilled chicken, romaine, carrots, bean sprouts, green onions, cilantro, rice noodles, wontons, almonds, and Sesame seeds tossed in a sesame-soy dressing. Her only compliant was it was a bit soggy. I ordered my usual - Miso Salmon, which consisted of salmon marinated with a sweet miso sake glaze served over white rice and snow peas in a savory  white miso sauce. By the end of the way, all of us were too full to consume cheesecake. My favorites are the Raspberry White Chocolate Swirl and New York Style Cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda
Hibah S.,"Germantown, MD",124,160,125,4.0,5/14/2017,"My party of four came here on a Saturday afternoon with no reservation. It was my graduation lunch, so we didn't make a reservation, thinking the ceremony might go longer than anticipated. Anyway, we had to wait 30 minutes, which was kind of a blower because I was in four-inch heels, needed a seat, and the one seat in the small waiting area was occupied. But the time went by faster than expected, especially considering the place was PACKED. (It's much smaller than I expected, too.) I found the hosts to be less than friendly. They were stale-faced and did not apologize when they messed up our table ticket. But our server, Nick, was fantastic. He was fast, polite, genuine, and got all of our orders right without even writing them down! That is a skill only seasoned servers can master.  The bread was not ready for about 15 minutes and when it came out, it wasn't that good. I've definitely had better bread. The entrees came out in record time. I was baffled. I ordered the Shrimp Bistro Pasta and it was phenomenal. Naturally, it was drowning in butter. But the flavors were on point and done tastefully. The only thing I didn't like was that the shrimp were breaded. I feel that is unnecessary. The breading on my shrimp was unevenly cooked (partly burnt, partly soggy, not yummy), but if I removed the breading altogether, the bare shrimp were cooked well and tasted better with the pasta. As a side note, if you're watching your weight, just don't come here. They have a ''skinny'' menu, but why? You're surrounded by cheesecake! You will be tempted. Plus, there's no way I would pay $18 for a salad. For dessert, we were very naughty and ordered a slice of cheesecake EACH. We didn't expect the slices to be that big or that amazing, but they were. The Fresh Strawberry is their most popular flavor and I loved it. It's basic cheesecake with a strawberry topping and it's done right. The Salted Caramel tasted just like you would expect true salted caramel to taste like. The Godiva one had big chunks of real Godiva chocolate - holy smokes. The best one by far was the Oreo. Everyone was blown away.  We took half of everything home in boxes because that's how big the portions are. The menu seems to be expensive, but the huge portions make up for it. We also ordered an extra entree and cheesecake to go and our bill was under $150. Not bad for four, essentially five people.  I will definitely be back here. My first visit was a 10/10. Thanks for making my graduation lunch so great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda
Penny C.,"North Bethesda, MD",2,36,,1.0,1/13/2018,"We ordered carry out for the first time and were really disappointed with the quality and portion sizes. I was quite upset to see such small portions when we normally get much larger portions when we dine in. They use huge containers but barely put anything in them. Also, nothing tasted good. It all tasted like cafeteria food. I am so, so disappointed with all the food we had. We would have better off eating at the eatery in the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda
Joy B.,"Rockville, MD",170,338,3378,4.0,2/19/2017,"Light, creamy, rich, and dreamy; that is the way I like my cheesecake. No one does it better than the Cheesecake Factory. My latest trip to the restaurant included trying a lighter and healthier Cheesecake ( hahaha).  No really, the base was made out of ladyfingers and it had a raspberry drizzle, with hints of lemon in the cake. The dessert was light and refreshing. It was 700 calories and I split it with a friend, so only a mere 350 calories. That could have been a bagel in the morning or a breakfast muffin, but soooo much more satisfying.    I also have to mention the portabella,avocado,and zucchini fries. They were insanely good. Fried to a crisp, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, each bite was a happy dance in my mouth. It is my new must have dish at Cheesecake Factory. Yes, it is that good!!    The service is always spectacular!  I love the warm brown bread and butter that starts every meal. My go to main dish is the Asian lettuce wrap. The grilled chicken and fresh veggies topped with my favorite peanut sauce is phenomenal!    So whether you are in the mood for a delicious dessert or just want some great food, head on over to Cheesecake Factory and be prepared to be delighted!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda

Vince W.,"Chambersburg, PA",11,3,,2.0,12/28/2017,"Wow. Expected the most elite service and food when arriving at his fancy restaurant. To my surprise, the service was almost garbage quality. Our glasses of water never got refilled once but the table right beside us got refilled three times the duration we stayed. The salad had rotting pieces of vegetables on it. Could have made us sick. The parts that weren't rotten looked like they weren't even washed. Salmon was okay. Steak was actually very delicious.

Rita W.,"Rockville, MD",527,337,1553,2.0,11/27/2016,"Jeez, what's with the service here? It took over 40 minutes for us to get our check for a mediocre meal. I have a soft spot for Cheesecake Factory because I love the interior and some of their drinks, cake, and apps, but c'mon!! The times I've been to this location have been ridiculous that I wonder why I come back more often than it makes sense. We've tried several things here, apps including -  Avocado Egg Rolls - one of our favorite apps here. A nice crunch, plenty of dipping sauce, filled with avocado goodness.  Firecracker Salmon - totally not worth over the $12. The plating was horrible. It seems that it would have been pretty plating, but by the time it came to our table, it was all on one side that I tried to rearrange it for a picture. The salmon was overly dry, and the stuff was just falling apart.  Wings - nothing special. Some had good amount of meat in them, but overall was dry.  Samosas - again, dry. Dry, dry, dry. We've gotten these lunch items and main entree items -  Sandwich/soup combo - sandwich was alright, regardless of which one you choose - half a turkey sandwich or chicken-almond salad sandwich, with a soup. The sandwiches were pretty good, but the soup was SOOO SALTY!!! I couldn't taste anything else, but the salt. Yuck. The pot of soup is premade, so tough luck there.  Lunch salads - these are alright. Can't go totally wrong with some greens, dressing, toppings, meat. If I were more of a salad person, I'd get these more often.  Fish n Chips - sometimes these are good, but other times they aren't. Sometimes the fish comes out sooooo good, but other times the breading comes falling off, or it's mostly breading and not mostly fish, and the fries come bland.  Burgers - good burgers, but not rememberable burgers.  Kids items -  Chicken - my kids love chicken tenders, but these were just the worst. Chewy, dry, no flavor.  We didn't any refills on our beverages - coffee, water, etc. :(  On the plus side, nothing we ordered was raw or undercooked, ha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda

Dan F.,"Potomac, MD",0,2,,1.0,1/9/2018,This restaurant is disorganized and incompetent.  I picked up 2 salads to go and when I get home I realized that 1 of them was missing the chicken. So I called to ask for a refund for one of the salads. I was told only a manager could process a refund and put on hold for 10 minutes. A manager never came to pick up so the woman at the desk promised me that she would take care of it. Not surprisingly  I checked my credit card online and I was never refunded the money. So I called back again and was put on hold for another 10 minutes to talk to a manager. This manager told me that since the incident happened several days ago she was unable to process the refund for me.  Needless to say I would not advise carrying out from this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda

Mack K.,"Chevy Chase, MD",65,4,,2.0,9/29/2017,"Outrageously expensive, considering the poor in-store takeout service and the quality of food.  A $78 meal for two via carryout last night = no plasticware or napkins (when asked by phone, we said yes) + 10+ minutes waiting for the $8 Oreo milkshake (after paying and receiving the food, which turned cold).  That aside, the food quality was below average at best and cold when I got home due to the 10-minute wait for the milkshake. I live 2 miles from the store. (Perhaps the long wait on the milkshake was due to the server guy getting lost on his way to the bar???).  Until Cheesecake makes up for this, I absolutely cannot and will not recommend this location to anyone. Save your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda

Cam C.,"Washington, DC",68,74,275,4.0,5/21/2017,"I usually visit this location to get a to-go order, usually after I shop in the mall or after going to the movie theater that's upstairs.  For the most part, the service at the front counter is alright. CF is often a busy place, and there have been a couple times the staff has been forgetful.  They forgot my fries one time, but luckily I checked inside my bag before I left.  They quickly brought them out when I brought it to their attention, but the staff did not even apologize or act like they cared about neglecting an entire side item in my order.  Another time they almost forgot an entire order of nachos.  They've also forgotten to include bread and butter when I asked for it (more of a minor issue than a missing appetizer or side order, but still a sign they need to slow down).  I will continue to order to-go food, but I suggest you take a peek in your bag before running out of the restaurant. I recently experienced CF's happy hour for the first time.  I must say I am very pleased!  HH is M-F from 4p-6p.  I was shocked at how large the portions were for HH, and the selection of food and drink items is abundant.  Pretty much all of the food was $5.95.  My friend and I shared a couple of the appetizers (Spinach Dip and Tex-Mex Egg Rolls) and we ordered some drinks (Wine and a Long Island Iced Tea).  I will be back for happy hour without a doubt. I can certainly say this location has good integrity.  My friend forgot her debit card at the restaurant one day.  My friend called the restaurant and a staff member informed her that it was locked in a safe.  She picked up her debit card later that week with no issues. Overall, this is a decent place.  I will be taking advantage of their HH more often for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda

What's even better is their Tiramisu. No, not the Tiramisu cheesecake, but the actual tiramisu. It's really fantastic.

Lucky us! However, I wish the food was as good as the cheesecake. My friends raved about the bread basket but I just thought it was meh. I was really disappointed with the ""spicy"" Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp. Not only was any black pepper flavor missing from the dish, but it was soooo sweet.

But in all seriousness, my experience here was awesome. They have LOTS of options, and it takes awhile to sift through their menu. Our waiter gave us enough time to do just that without forgetting about us. He came in and checked in on us to refill water and bread whenever we needed and was charismatic too.  Now, let's talk food. I like lists so I'll tell you what we got (in the order of my fav to least fav): - Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo w/ white rice - fanfreakintastic! I will be ordering this for myself next time I'm here - Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya Pasta - good but could use less oil and the addition of sausage - Chicken and Bacon Carbonara (had lots of peas) - Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta (I believe that's what it's called) - needed more sauce I tried a bit of everything (and a bit more of that gumbo). I was looking at that gumbo the way someone looks at their crush. No lie, it's real good.  What I love about the Cheesecake Factory is that the portions are large enough for you to have enough leftovers for another meal. Something to keep in mind when you see the prices. It's like you're paying for dinner and a late night snack (I like to call it dinner pt 2).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=20

Wesley Y.,"Rockville, MD",720,325,623,1.0,8/9/2016,"This is a long overdue review from 3 months ago. I came in @ lunch time with 2 of my friends and we all ordered off the lunch menu. (pointed @ the lunch selection items) We came at about 2:30pm which to me is just a late lunch. Apparently to our server its dinner time. She put in the dinner size portion for us. I didn't realize this while we were eating the entree because the portions are huge @ cheesecake factory. I tried to order 3 cheesecakes and use our coupons that we had to redeem free cheesecakes (I purchased $200 in giftcards and got some free  silces of cheesecakes). We waited about 10-15 minutes for the cheesecake. We told the server to pack the cheesecake togo because it was taking too long and my friend had an Uber  waiting outside the restaurant going to the airport.  When the server brought the check and the 3 cheesecakes I saw the check and realized that we were charged for dinner portions. I asked to speak with a Manager and she told me we have to Specifically tell the server we want lunch portions when we come in for lunch. This should definitely be a server's immediate response if they have customers ordering lunch items maybe they should ask do you want the lunch or dinner portion. Just plain ridiculous. After arguing with the  manager over the bill my friend had to leave and couldnt wait anymore. She comes back and tells me that we can only redeem 2 cheesecakes because we have 2 people. After lots of explaining the server didn't even try to help explain to the manager we were a party of 3.  Worst experience I've had @ cheesecake ever. This location is just going down the drain. Loved the restaurant more when it was @ white flint. The new servers, manager and entire staff i feel just don't care anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=20

Afterwards, when we were escorted in a very friendly manner to the table where we were to dine at, we received a bread basket.

Robyn S.,"Keysville, VA",16,25,9,4.0,4/26/2016,"I ate here with my friend from Bethesda roughly a week ago and I was so excited because I rarely ever get to eat at The Cheesecake Factory - I'm from out of state and the closest one to me is over 60 miles away. We were told it'd be a 20 minute wait and we asked to be seated in the 'fake outside' - the part of the restaurant outside of the main restaurant room, but still inside of the mall. We were told they were short handed and couldn't seat is out there, but we noticed other people were seated out at the tables and my friend talked to the wait staff until they agreed to put us out there when our time came to be seated. I don't know about the rest of you, but I can't hear myself think straight in that main room where it sounds like everyone is shouting at each other. We ordered the pasta carbonara with chicken and found it to be a little bland, but I added salt and found that it was improved greatly with just that. I gobbled up what I hoped was half of the dish while my friend was displeased and sort of gave up on it. I drank a red sangria with my food and found it to be rather delightful. When it was time to pick a piece of cheesecake, I felt very torn. I adore cheesecake and can never remember which ones I've tried during the few experiences I've had with TCF. I ended up choosing the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake and it was DIVINE. I couldn't finish it and would have taken it with me, but I was leaving in the morning for a road trip and wasn't sure if remember it was in my friend's refrigerator.

Effie A.,"Silver Spring, MD",86,75,44,1.0,6/29/2016,"I have never felt so disrespected at a restaurant, the way Cheesecake Factory disrespected my family. On June 23rd, I brought my family here to celebrate my dad and youngest brothers birthday. When our server (Brandon J) came by to ask what we wanted to drink, we told him without hesitation. 3 of us ordered Shirley Temples, my mom ordered mango juice (which was pink but we're not going to talk about that) and my dad ordered pineapple juice. When the drinks came out my dad noticed that his pineapple juice was basically ALL ICE. So he called the server back to let him know that he doesn't like ice and would just like a glass of pineapple juice. The server comes back with a shot of pineapple juice in the same glass. (Now bear with me.. because I don't have a picture, I'm going to use numbers to help you get a better idea of this). The glass was about 5-5.5 inches tall, they poured just an inch of pineapple juice in the glass and gave it to my dad who came there to celebrate his birthday. That's literally 2, maybe 2.5 sips from the straw and it's finished.  When my dad called the server out on it, the server said ""you didn't want ice so we strained it"". WHAT?! We were shocked! We couldn't believe he wanted us to pay full price for a shot of pineapple juice. So the server then gets his manager (Amos), who said the same exact thing the server said ""we strained the pineapple juice because you didn't want ice"". We felt so insulted. Common sense is clearly not so common at that restaurant. After letting him know that it was absolutely disrespectful, the manager told my dad he would get him a full glass of pineapple juice. Which was what should have happened in the first place. When our check came, they had charged us for 2 glasses of pineapple juice instead of 1. So we had to call them out on that too. We left feeling like they were playing a prank on us. I'm not sure I'll be back there again. I'm definitely not spending my hard earned money on them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=100
Emily H.,"Escondido, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/23/2016,"My boyfriend, Andrew, and I went to Cheesecake factory this past weekend thinking it would be a positive experience, like every other time we had gone. Andrew is the manager of a sales team, and as a team dinner we decided to all head over to the restaurant. We had a party of about 15. Everything about dinner was great, the food and the service were wonderful, or so we thought. When the check came around, it was about $77 for the whole meal. Including a $14 tip for the waitress, the total came out to about $91. We put $70 in cash into the check holder along with a debit card to cover the remaining balance of about $21.  I thought that this was common knowledge, seeing as how I have worked in my fair share of restaurants, that when both cash and a card are put into the check holder it means to use the cash first and then put the remaining balance onto the card- but if the waitress had any questions about this we would certainly be more than happy to clarify that for her. She had no questions and brought us back the receipt. Andrew did not realize that she had charged him the ENTIRE $91 onto his card AND also taken the cash. That is the problem.  If she would have charged the card for the whole thing and given our cash back, things would be just peachy but she did not.  Andrew did not notice that he was charged for the whole thing until yesterday (Wednesday 6/22). He called the store and the general manager, Liz, told us that he signed a legal binding document agreeing to be charged $91. That is fine. But give us back our cash. To this she responded, ""Well we have no way of proving that there was any cash taken by the server. We will call and ask her and its basically her word against yours"". That is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, we should have been paying a bit more attention at the time and noticed then, but the nature of the  response we have received and lack of any customer service what so ever is appalling to me. I do not see how it is difficult to check the logs which, I would assume must be kept when each drawer is counted out each night and see if that particular drawer was over $70. She has not even given us the courtesy of checking back to that day and seeing if there was any mysterious extra cash anywhere in the restaurant. And if that drawer was not over at all, maybe you have the bigger issue of a waitress that is stealing from the customers. Liz has basically told us ""sorry, but your stupidity lost you $70 to us"". She claims that she called the waitress that rang up our bill, but the waitress has not called back. I'm sorry but that is not my problem. We brought at least $500 in service that night with our entire sales team, and after that experience and how the general manager and the staff of this Cheesecake Factory have been handling this, I will never bring my business back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=100

We ordered an appetizer and entrees. The appetizer came out before our water! We specifically requested lemons with our water and of course, the waiter forgot the lemons so we had to re-request them. A different person delivered our food (not the waiter) and he was fantastic. Even the bus boy was attentive and extremely diligent. We ordered a kale salad without cheese and the dressing on the side.

I don't know what it is about cheesecake, I am never super impressed, but the food is good enough to go back. So I came back here a month later. I have not had time to write the review until now. My friend and I split some kind of Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls and a crabcake appetizer. My main course was the Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi. The vietnamese rolls are not recommended. Crabcakes were small but at least it wasn't a bunch of filler; good amount of crabmeat. As for the main dish, the salmon wasn't spectacular and the shrimp were super heavy. The mashed potatoes was by far the best thing on the plate. I would come back just to get mashed potatoes, hahah.

beth s.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,14,3,1.0,3/25/2016,"This is a critique of the management staff Cheesecake Factory. I ate at the restaurant at Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, MD last night with a girlfriend. We each ordered a salad and I got a glass of sangria. When the bill came my drink vas very nearly as much as our salads - $11.50! Knowing I would not have ordered the drink if I knew it was going to be that much, I asked to see the menu to check the price. What do you know --- there were no prices next to the drinks! I did not fault the waitress but expressed my shock and asked to speak to the manager. I knew well this was a policy decision. A very youthful and inexperienced Jennifer came over and inquired. I explained my frustration. She just gazed at me. Then I was interrogated about when I realized drink prices were not listed on the menu. Really? So much for listening to the customer's concerns. She informed me that ""many restaurants are doing this now"" as if this was news. That doesn't make it ok in my opinion. I can go elsewhere. Then Manager Jennifer asked if I wanted her to take our check to the register. I said NO!  I explained that I felt not listing drink prices was misleading and rude, like I had been tricked. They could list the calories, but not the prices? More gazing by Jennifer. She finally asked what I wanted her to do. I said she could either remove the drink form my bill (if there are no prices maybe the drinks should be free?) or at least give me a discount of half for my frustration and to make me a happy customer again. She took the bill and disappeared for a few minutes. When she came back she handed me the bill with all of a $2 DISCOUNT! REALLY??? What an insult  and snub and I told her so. I said I would never be back. Do not eat at the Cheesecake Factory unless you're okay with deception.

I've noticed a few recurring themes in negative reviews. One is that there is a long wait. Of course there will be a wait, since it's a very popular restaurant! But you will get seated eventually, like I said we came at a very busy time and were seated in about a half hour. The other complaint I see a lot is the price.

What other place do you know of that has 654561681 different menu items that they can reproduce within 15 minutes of ordering and have it taste the same every time.  Not only do they pump out food they do so in ginormous portions.  Im always good for at least 2 full meals when I go because the leftovers will be plenty filling. 2nd - Since it is a chain, no matter what Cheesecake factory you go to, whether its here or in bum fuck Kansas......and I mean really, who ever visits Kansas?  Anyways, you know that you are going to get the same quality in food.  Sorry Mom and Pop shops, your food does me no good when I am half way across the country and you are in Maryland. 3rd - Where else do you know that serves 33 different flavors of Cheesecake?  And if you don't like cheesecake.....well then you sir, have got mental issues!! Dont come here expecting something different than what it is For me its all about the Cajun Jambalaya over rice with just Shrimp.  And I always get an extra side of the sauce.  That way if you are asian like me.....you can go home cook more rice dump that Saucy goodness into the rice and enjoy a second serving.

After another 30 minutes they tell us that they are now boiling the pasta. The manager came out to apologize, but that was it. We finally got our food after an hour and twenty minutes.

The vegetables were burnt so badly that they were inedible. In fact, my entire dish tasted like charred food. The only thing cooked properly was the rice, however with such a lack of sauce and no soy sauce, it only added to the dryness. I will be making a formal complaint about this lunch experience.

Not to alarm anyone, within about 5minutes we had the correct dish out. I felt bad because if you guys met our server she was beyond nice, when we made her aware of the onions on the food she looked like she wanted to cry. She took care of it beyond an expedited manner and we all ate our food on time. Food was great, Service well I have already applauded that and environment was like all other Cheesecake Factory's. I did take off one star, I'll explain what happened. We obviously wanted a dish with no onions and our server took care of that. We had no issues or complaints until the Manager came along. She did the usual blah blah blah and what bothered me was that she said that the order was not incorrect that it was the guacamole that had onions. Um, cool but there are still onions elsewhere else, cool story. Instead of making a situation right she tried to justify the order being correct. Look, you apologized and did your part leave it alone. Let's not fumble the situation and add a story that makes you look bad.

I took my office here for lunch to celebrate a birthday, thinking it would be a good experience since they have many different choices available. I regret it because the food was awful and the service was just as bad. With the cost of the food, one would think they would do a better job than they do. It's also so busy here that you really don't get the customer service you deserve because the servers are focusing on getting as many tips as possible by waiting a lot of tables as opposed to refilling your drink or making sure your food is cold, for example. On the other hand, I haven't been in one Cheesecake Factory that isn't busy, but the food and service is much better than this one! To add insult to injury, it's noisy as hell in this one!  I did have the decency to call the General Manager, Liz, and spoke to her about how embarrassing it was for me to suggest this place and then I and my coworkers weren't happy with the quality of the food or the service. She did apologize and offered (in January) to send a gift certificate for just the cost of my meal ($30) and told me it would be in the mail and at my address in a week, but after 6 weeks went by I hadn't received it.  I called to follow up and despite the fact that the hostess told me that she was there, Liz refused to take my call. I even left a message about what happened with my name and number, and she never called me back--that was over 2 weeks ago. WOW! I've been to really great Cheesecake Factory locations (like the one on Wisconsin and the one at Columbia Mall) and this is definitely not the experience I've had, so I'm thinking it's just this location.

I ordered a beet salad to go- When I asked for an extra salad dressing the lady gave me an excuse maybe she was being lazy- she said it was a large dressing- I ALWAYS get extra dressing with my salads and I offered to pay if that was the issue.  Then she asked me if I wanted bread & I said sure.  When she handed the bag to me there was no bread ... I asked the lady who placed my order for the bread and she rolled her eyes at me.  15 minute wait time was quoted but I waited longer for my food... which wasn't too bad  I drive all the way back to work & open my salad and find 3-4 pieces of bacon in it.  I didn't order any meat and there shouldn't have been any mix up or traces of other food mixed into my salad.  Also, the salad was not so big- it was packed into a large dinner size container with a large bag....wasn't necessary.  1 star for the host who greated me & 1 star for the 3 extra things of butter she threw into my over sized bag, along with the salad being 80% lettuce -------this is why I need extra dressing !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=120

Margaret Z.,"Manhattan, NY",260,730,78,4.0,7/21/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory was recently implanted at Montgomery Mall near Old Navy after moving from its old home, White Flint Mall (RIP). I wasn't completely thrilled to come here after having a mediocre experience at a CF in Jersey, but was willing to give this a try.  To my surprise, this place was PACKED for a Monday night and there was a 15 minute wait for 3 people. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and I really appreciated that the seats were far enough apart to not feel cramped. The ambience is really nice and what I like to call ""classy casual"".  It took longer than usual for the waiter to get around with bread and water, but he was super friendly which made up for it. He got our drink orders in quickly and we didn't have to wait long before our orders arrived at the table. I ordered something off the ""Skinnylicious"" menu because I was shocked that most of the entrees on the regular menu were close to 2000 calories - usually my entire daily intake. My girlfriend was ambitious and opted for the carbonara pasta (2500 cals!!) while our other guy friend got the chicken with biscuits. His looked really good and HUGE... the plate was loaded with a heaping serving of mashed potatoes, a large homestyle biscuit, and chicken with some veggies scattered about.  My entree was the chicken pasta - gremelli (skinny spirals - I had to Google this at the table) with marinara sauce, tomatoes, and grilled chicken. The portion size was perfect and I felt very comfortably full at the end of my meal, with room to spare for dessert. The chicken was seasoned well though slightly dry for my taste. The pasta itself could've been cooked a little more, but I prefer more tender pasta to ""al dente"" so I probably should have specified. All in all, it tasted healthy and was exactly what I wanted - plus it was only 500 calories!  We also ordered the Oreo cheesecake to split... though I ended up having to take 2 bites and pack the rest because my friends were stuffed. It is very rich and chocolatey but extremely delicious... honestly all of the cheesecakes I've had here have been divine, so it's good to know the chain is living up to its namesake.  I don't recommend the sangria, however, because it was extremely watered down and tasted too citrusy. The beer and wine are better values.  Our waiter was very attentive and prompt throughout the entire night, checking on us periodically and making sure we were happy with our meal. He was also really patient when we needed a long time to decide on our dessert.

From the portions size to the cool decor to the crazy amount of options, this place is my go-to for a casual lunch with a friend (especially, in this location, if I'm shopping).  I *highly* recommend the ""Pasta Da Vinci"" - it's so delicious and the sauce they use is unique from the usual alfredo and marinara sauces you usually find with pastas. It's made with a delicious wine reduction that makes my taste buds dance.  The crabcake sandwich is pretty delicious as well, though I'm not sure how much of it is actually crab meat and not filling - but I'm a lover of all crab cakes! The service can be pretty slow during the dinner rush, but my lunch experience today was excellent. The place opens for lunch at 11:30am and we got there at 12:15am - immediately seated and experienced decently prompt service. They are very accommodating of certain things you want modified with your meal, such as extra sauce or more thoroughly cooked pasta.  Overall, I love this place. I feel a bit guilty about how many calories I just ate when I'm leaving but hey, I always pack leftovers!  Tip: Make sure you ask for more bread to pack as well.

Starr C.,"McLean, VA",128,294,427,5.0,6/3/2012,"I was here a few months ago catching up with some old friends. (Basically, ever since the beginning of my relationship, I was told that the entire ""crew"" would eat at Cheesecake one day. This was that day.) We had a phenomenal server who was just super awesome. I regret forgetting his name and not writing it down, but he was fantastic. A lot of fun but very professional. He made sure we had a great time. The boy and I are huge eaters, so we ordered the roadslide sliders to start. We wolfed them down like animals because we were hungry, but they weren't quite slider-sized. They were actually almost exactly the size of a McDonald's plain hamburger, but a bit tastier. Nothing particularly outstanding, but they did the job they were supposed to do, which was help stave off hunger while making the other couples who didn't order appetizers hungrier. =P I ordered one of the specials that day, the barbecued salmon. It was VERY good, and I'm glad it was one of the specials because I was going to otherwise order the regular grilled salmon. The sweetness of the barbecue sauce was delicious on the salmon. Accompanied by a giant mountain of yummy-in-my-tummy mashed potatoes (seriously, that thing was the size of a softball), crispy thin onion rings (more like onion strings but ring-shaped), on a bed of corn succotash, I believe? Very tasty. And of course, our table totally demolished the bread offered with as much decorum as we could muster. The boy had the chipotle pasta which he didn't seem to love. It was also an overwhelming portion. Some friends ordered the hibachi steak and they seemed to LOVE it. Most of us were way too stuffed for dessert, but the people who ordered cheesecake got it quite fast. I definitely had a fantastic time here. I like that the portions are quite filling, considering the higher price tags on the items here.  Good good good good good food. So good.

Lea K.,"Clarksburg, MD",12,7,4,2.0,3/11/2015,"I'm writing this review a month late because I wanted to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  I loved the Cheesecake Factory when it was located in White Flint.  I used to be one of those crazy people that would wait 2-3 hours for a table.  I used to also order to go when I couldn't wait in those lines.   Now for my recent experience.  On New Year's Eve, I ordered to go.  I drove 30 minutes to Montgomery Mall to pick up my food.  When I got there, the individual that brought my food out told me that my cheesecake was not quite ready since they had to put strawberries on it.  I waited an additional 10 minutes and even tipped the server  extra for bringing my food out to my car.  Because it took so long for my cheesecake to come out, I did not check it.  When I got home, I opened the box only to find a frozen cheesecake without any of the toppings they were supposedly putting on it while I wait an extra 10 minutes.  I called the restaurant and the manager was kind enough to give us a cheesecake for my husband to pick up on his way home without making us bring back the other.   Fast forward to February 14th, my husband picked up food for Valentine's Day so we can have a nice dinner in with our kids.  Again, Cheesecake made a mistake with our order.  They charged us for a dessert item but did not include it in the bag.  I called the manager and she took down my address and name and told me she would be sending us a gift card in place of the dessert.  I thanked her and waited for the gift card. It's now been a month and no gift card.  My low rating is for the poor customer service at the counter when we picked up the food, the mistakes with the dessert, and finally for the lack of the manager following through on her promise to send us a gift card.  I can honestly say I will never order take out from Cheesecake again and probably would not set foot into their restaurant.  I no longer have the patience to wait 2-3 hours for a seat in a restaurant that does not take care of its customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=120

Connie M.,"Rockville, MD",290,203,507,4.0,12/12/2013,"What can i say about Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said? Giant portions and the most delicious cheesecake!!! Now that they print their calorie count (which has to hurt since the portions are ginormous), I am guessing that is why they came up with their ""Skinnylicious menu"". Yay!! We started off with their skinny summer rolls ($7). I'm not sure if you could make summer rolls any skinnier, but they did. Delicate Rice Paper Rolled Around Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Carrots, Rice Noodles, Green Onion, Cilantro and Shrimp with a peanut dipping sauce as well as a chili, soy one. YUM!! It was a busy Saturday night with a 40 minute wait so we scoped out the bar and managed to find a table in 10 mins. Natascha was our server and I'm not sure if she was having a bad day but she was not on point. She smiled when I smiled at her and she refilled my drink without asking but my two sisters felt neglected as she did not refill their EMPTY glasses. Granted, they were packed like usual but as I used to be a server, the bar is set pretty high (sorry guys!!) I had the Factory burrito grande ($14). I had seen facebook pictures of it and wanted to try what looked like the biggest burrito in the world!! It was packed with chicken, rice, peppers, onions, cheese and cilantro and smothered with sauce and more cheese. There was a side of black beans, guacamole and sour cream....and it was very delicious!!! But it was not as big as it was in the past...but I am glad I tried it...next time will stick with my favorites though. (I packed 1/2 of it to go so I could save room for cheesecake!!) My sister got the shepherd's pie. This NEVER DISAPPOINTS!!! Ground Beef, Mushrooms, Carrots, Peas, Zucchini and Onions in a Delicious brown Sauce  Covered with a Mashed Potato-Parmesan Cheese Crust ($15). I swear this is the best shepherd's pie I have ever eaten!!!  Even though the portion is just a tad smaller (yep, I can tell!!), it is still worth every penny. Luckily she couldn't eat it all and the baby sister and I got to help her.....nom nom nom Baby sister ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad ($18). Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared Rare with Avocado, Wasabi Pesto, Tomato and Mixed Greens with a Shallot Vinaigrette. She didn't speak much while inhaling one of the smallest salads on the menu (have you seen the others? piled high to the sky in giant bowls!!!). No one asked for a bite as we weren't sure it would fill her up (it didn't) but when she came up for air, she mumbled something about how delicious and perfectly cooked the tuna was and that the dressing was perfect.  In case you didn't know it, Cheesecake factory can actually split any dessert in half so you each get your own plate (and extra whipped cream!!!). We asked them to split the Peppermint Bark slice ($8) with half packed to take home and enjoy later. This has to be the best flavor ever invented...it reminds me of my childhood when I would eat peppermint ice cream....yum!! I almost dropped a star because Natascha brought me the check before they brought us our cheesecake, but she did bring us bread...after we asked for it and she did refill their drinks...after we asked for it. She wasn't rude. It just seemed like she was preoccupied....hope her week improves!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=120

There was A family that came in after us and got waited on before us. Smh. When the waitress finally came over with water she took our drink orders which took forever before we got that. I flagged down a waiter And asked him to get his manager, he asked what he could do for us and we told him to just cancel our order. He seemed a bit worried and promised to try his best to make our experience better. But we were already fed up. We got up to leave when a manager came and asked us if everything was Ok? We said no, told her what happened and she couldn't think of anyway to salvage the situation, she just walked away.

My boy. laughing his ass off at me, had to calm me down & tell me that she wasnt the person who would be taking our food order. So, when our server did come, I already knew what I wanted because my greedy ass had looked the menu up online before I left work, lolo!! I ordered: crab wontons for appetizers, main course: barbeque salmon, steamed broccoli, smashed potatoes & onion strings. My boy ordered a kobe beef hamburger & fries. Forgot what his appetizer was. But here's the thing, he & I were so engrossed in our conversation, that I hadnt noticed that my food was taking extra long to come. Turns out, as the manager came over to tell me, that they had overcooked my salmon. And, for my wait, I could get a free dessert! I choose carrot cake. I didnt know it would be 3 layers!

Given its well known name, I normally wouldn't bother to write a review, but one of their menu items has given me cause to Yelp. The almighty Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake is by far one of the best desserts I have ever experienced. Layers of Red Velvet cake between layers of cheesecake? Can life be any more decadent? I usually come here just to get a slice to go and whenever I bring it home, my family descends upon it in wonder as if it's a holy relic. One of the most fabulous desserts EVER and a great reward or comfort after a hard day. That aside, I've enjoyed all Cheesecake Factory restaurants and this one is no exception. As one Yelper mentioned, the lighting is extremely dim here, but it also depends on where you sit. I had a window table and I was perfectly fine. My ace in the hole entree is the BBQ Chicken Salad.

Anyway, our server was very attentive and immediately gave us the complete spiel on the daily specials and soups. My mind was already set though- I wanted the cajun seafood pasta- my favorite. And it was amazing; huge portions and great breadsticks too. I topped it off with cranberry juice and original cheesecake while my date had the most delicious pumpkin cheesecake I've ever tasted in my life. Yes!!!!!

We were seated in the furthest of corners at Cheesecake last night. Way in the back. It was quite the hike to get back to the bathroom near the front doors (I exaggerate but you get the picture). Took a while for anything to get to the table. My beer took about 30 minutes to arrive. That's after a manager finally spotted us. Likewise, our meals, extra bread, refills, all took a while. As noted earlier I had a bit to drink. Which prompted me to blurt out ""dude you suck"" as our waiter walked away when he finally checked up on us. I swear he didn't hear, but my companions insist that he probably did. Service was much better after that. Food was decent. The expansive menu always takes a lot longer to browse through. The Spicy Crispy Chicken sandwich (Buffalo style) was not as good as I though it would be. The Thai Lettuce wraps were good. My BBQ burger was ok.  The 30-year Anniversary cheesecake was ok, but very sweet. I very much liked the crunchy chocolate that coats the outside of the cheesecake. The new Banana Cream cheesecake was enjoyable.

We hadn't been here in over a year.One reason we don't come more often is the long lines. I guess we chose the wrong day to come back: the day after Christmas. It was pretty late, 9:30 pm after movies, we figured it should be OK. We were partly right. We were seated right away, but then  the real waiting started...  We ordered nothing fancy, salad, pasta and side dish. An hour later, my pasta finally arrived.Judging by its sad aspect, it had been seating on the counter for at least half hour. The pasta was dry, the chicken overcooked. The side dish never came, but by then I was so fed up I did not want to wait a minute longer. I complained to the store manager and to his credit he offered us free dessert to make amends. Nice gesture, but I would rather have fresh food timely served than free dessert.  One intriguing fact of the Cheesecake Factory menu. The menu does not show the price for cocktails and beers. My guess is that this is a strategy to maximize profits from sales of alcohol. I asked the waiter who gave me a lame excuse (""we operate in many states which have different taxes on alcohol, so we need to print a single menu without prices....""). Really does not stand up to reason: food and wine are also taxed differently in every state but every bottle of wine and every food item in the menu has a price. What do you think?

I learned that they do not do reservations on the weekends, which I guess I can understand because then everyone and their mom would have one. I wanted to leave after the 1st hour, but since people started arriving, it was too late and they decided to sit at the bar and drinks are not cheap. The food was just okay, I ordered a turkey burger and it came with a salad and not much of salad at that. Just leaves in olive oil. I didn't even order the cheesecake, which is what I came for because quite frankly, I was tired of waiting and already spend $70 on drinks and food just for myself and pitching in something for the birthday girl.

Gen C.,"Cleveland, OH",1,33,9,2.0,12/17/2015,"Normally I wouldn't bother writing a review for a place like the Cheesecake Factory (places like this you kind of know what to expect) but our experience was so poor that I feel like I need to warn people about this specific location, because from the looks of other reviews this is kind of the norm. A friend and I came for dinner on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm - wanting to catch up somewhere that reminded us of high school, so where else than the Cheesecake Factory, where we like every other American teenager used to go when we wanted a ""classy"" dining experience. I'm not trying to harp on the CF; it's a good place to go for some American chain restaurant dining, even if you're going there ""ironically"" like my friend and I were. Anyway, our experience: Walked in the and the hostess said hi and just stared at us, I'm not kidding. After a few awkward seconds, I asked for a table for two and she led us. Weird, but whatever. Our server, whose name we never got, didn't even bring us drinks (when we just wanted water) until after he had brought us our bread basket. The sweet brown bread was delicious, but the white bread was rather stale. He then took our orders, and our food was brought out within reasonable time by a different server who set it down and left. My friend ordered macaroni and cheese and was brought the fried macaroni and cheese balls appetizer. I ordered the Skinnylicious lemon garlic shrimp and asked for a side of vegetables instead of the pasta, but was instead brought a bowl of lettuce. As a former server I completely understand mix ups happen, but it was frustrating because if our server himself had brought us the food (instead of shmoozing with the table of girls next to us, which he was doing all night), he could have attended to it right away. When he saw us with our food he came over and right away pointed to my bowl of lettuce and said ""That's not a side of vegetables"" and picked it up to take it back. My friend is very shy and I knew wasn't going to say anything so I went ahead for her and let him know that she wanted mac and cheese, not the fried MC app. His response was ""Well, that's not what you were pointing to on the menu"", which kind of took me back - not how a server should respond. We both just kind of looked at him and he said ""Well, I can put in mac and cheese, but that's going to take a while"", and my friend said the app was fine, but I was pretty put off by that. He brought me back a side of vegetables: a plate of steamed snow peas, carrots, and something else drenched in this asian sauce. Not very good.  The MC balls were good but we were very unhappy with how he handled the whole thing. Also, if you go to CF, don't order off the Skinnylicious menu. I paid 17 dollars for six tiny pieces of shrimp and asparagus. It's not worth it - make CF your cheat meal, don't try to be healthy there. Lesson learned. Dessert was delicious, obviously: my friend and I shared the Cookie Dough Cheesecake and the Godiva Brownie Ice Cream Sundae. Our server brought out both with no utensils (after taking our dirty ones away), so we had to wait.  I would not go to this CF again. It seems like a lot of other people have had poor service here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=140

The hostess could not have been less helpful. I honestly think we would have waited longer had we not continued to inquire. She initially tried to seat us in the bar. When we finally did get seated another employee was literally sitting at the table setting it. We started out with two servers for drink orders but that quickly decreased to one. Disappointing for such a large group. Thankfully the young lady we were left with was pleasant and competent. Unfortunately the group was too large for one server. All of the orders came out at different times and the one vegetarian meal never did get put in. So that person was still eating lunch when everyone else was enjoying desert. This was pretty bad for a Friday afternoon. My advice? Avoid this location it's not worth the traffic or parking hassle.

Manager looked at me like I was an idiot when I explained (again) the long wait time for the food and how it arrived cold and soggy.

I always love the salads, but there are too many choices to review on this book- like menu and the portions may keep you from the cheesecake decision list, but if you have a hankering for a desert you can't go wrong with the cheesecake here or for that matter the strawberry shortcake. The strawberry shortcake is a very large biscuit filled with vanilla ice cream and then piled high with strawberries and topped with whipped cream. The shortcake can serve 3 or 4 people if they have eaten their own entrees or even shared them with others.

Sure, it's a big plate of food that you can take home for leftovers, but I've had better at other restaurants. Also, it concerns me that they offer no nutritional information on their website. Having to list it on the menu would be business suicide, but not even listing it on the site? Shady.  I have heard that people like to go here because it's a place you can ""take a group of people, and everyone's happy."" I found that that translates to an amalgam of food options that merely hints at a more exciting fare but stays mostly in a safe, bland zone. Honestly, I prefer restaurants who do one kind of cuisine and do it really well. I would probably only come here a 2nd time if it were with another pre-determined group outing  or for the happy hour specials.

Some annoying factors to acknowledge: 1. Freakily friendly servers.   I'm upbeat by nature, but I've been almost frightened by the level of enthusiasm from CF's waiters -- on issues like whether I know how their tea is sweetened.  It's as if they were trained by Brian at Chotchkie's in ""Office Space""  -- minus the mandatory flare.  Of course I'd prefer over-enthusiasm to the alternative, but really, these people must get hit on their heads with happy sticks before their shifts begin. 2. The portions are also obnoxiously large.  Who am I kidding -- this doesn't bother me.  I can just choose to pig out, share or doggy-bag it. 3. The unbelievably long wait times, and corresponding buzzers.  Again, I thought these were cool as a kid -- until I realized that you have to be about two steps away from the door in order to stay in range.  As others have mentioned, during peak times, just stalk seats near the bar.  If you score one, you can order anything off the menu and avoid the wait. All in all, there's something annoyingly appealing that earns this place its three stars and keeps me coming back every once and awhile.  I mean, I've always liked the food from CF, and compared to NYC restaurants, you definitely get bang for your buck.   Final tip:  Who needs restraint?  For a full American hedonistic experience, save room for some freakin' cheesecake.  You can do it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=300

sergio m.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,9,3,2.0,10/25/2010,"I agree with many other reviewers, this place is overhyped and its past its prime. The Cheesecake Factory used to be a hip place to eat out in the early 90's... but now it seems its just generic and dated like a cheap Las Vegas hotel buffet. The decor in this particular Cheesecake is campy and very early 90's (think Luxor Hotel in Vegas). Its no longer cool. Now to the food, their chicken salad sandwich on toasted brie was gross. It had too much mayonaise & too much garlic. The chicken itself must have been boiled because it tasted like nothing. Because of this, the overwhelming taste of the garlic buttered brie bread was overbearing almost to the point of it being inedible. It was a HUGE sandwich but quantity did not make up for quality.  Their pepperoni pizza was average, the tex mex wraps were BLAH and lacked flavor although it was filled with black beans, avocado, rice onions and tomatoes. The carlton salad was OK but the ""vinaigrette"" dressing didn't seem to have any vinegar at all, it was rather sweet and oily much like sesame seed oil. The chicken mixed in their carlton salad also seemed to be boiled as it was also flavorless. They might as well have used tofu !  The one thing that I liked was the buffalo wings that were crispy, spicy and juicy.

Angela S.,"Frederick, MD",1,247,144,2.0,8/10/2010,"I used to like the food here a few years ago, but either its gone downhill or my taste buds have matured.  Before I review the actual food, I should say that of course the cheesecake is unbelievably fantastic, not a bad one in the bunch, and worth every penny of the almost $7 per slice.  That being said, keep in mind that you can come in and order a slice to go from the counter.  So there really is no need to eat here, and I would recommend doing just that (ordering a slice to go). I ate here last night after about a year-long hiatus (from the menu, not the cheesecake).  I was disappointed to see the salad I wanted, the Endive & Blue cheese, is no longer on the menu.  That was all I wanted, an appetizer salad and some cheesecake.  I looked at the other app salad options and remember trying 2 others and not liking either one: the Country French and Fresh Vegetable.  When I had the Country French a few years ago, I sent it back because there were PICKLED BEETS on it.  The menu says fresh beets, which to me are crunchy and raw.  About a year ago I had the Fresh Vegetable and swore I'd never have it again: it was like someone dumped a bag of frozen mixed vegetables on a salad (in fact, the green beans may have still been frozen).  Shouldn't have mattered considering I ordered the salad for the white cheaddar (as stated in the menu), only they didn't have white cheddar, so they put some other cheese on there that had no taste.   So I ended up getting Evelyn's favorite pasta, which I used to really enjoy.  Last time I had it (about a year ago), I found it to be really oily and left my lips slippery...just an unpleasant sensation overall.  But looking over the rest of the menu and remembering other mediocre meals from the past, I decided to stick with the Evelyn's pasta.  Bad choice.  I don't know what happened this time, but it tasted like feet.  Really salty feet.  I haven't had such horrible tasting food in I don't know how long.  I could barely bring myself to eat more than a couple of bites.   I am officially done with this place.  Take-out cheesecake will be the only thing I'll order ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=300

The ambiance at this location is much nicer to me than at the previous location. It appears to be larger and the seating seems more spread out.

He was great though, and even offered to split our checks without our asking. It was a little hard for me to find something that fit into my diet, but I settled on a small Greek salad. It was decent, but nothing really too special. The crab cake that another guest at our table ordered just looked okay and I noticed she didn't ask to have the leftover boxed to take home.

The food is typically pretty tasty and they have a vast ""skinnylicious"" menu. Always consistent and the honey wheat bread is great.  Today I visited for a lunch around 1:05. Our party of 4 was promptly seated. Javina was our waitress and was pleasant. She took our drink orders shortly after we sat down and then did not bring those drinks for at least 10-15 mins. She then took our order and proceeded to take drinks and the order of another table before inputting our order into the computer. Usually our food comes out quickly and to the proper temperature. Today was no different, but that was after she finally inputted the order. The food arrived to the table at approximately 1:45. So 40 mins for 2 salads and 2 sandwiches. It wasn't the speed in the kitchen, but the speed of the server. The food runner was pleasant and retrieved the bread I requested. After we were served, I asked the waitress for a refill assuming it would take a while to get and I was right. I could see our waitress leisurely talking to staff near the kitchen while I waited for my refill. I honestly would not have minded if she was prompt otherwise.

Only things I remembered before going last night were that there is a huge menu, it's a very popular restaurant, and they have great cheesecake. Not much has changed but I was enlightened on the quality of the food and the service. First I went on a Friday night with a party of and no reservation. I was surprised and impressed there was no wait. May have been because we dined at 10:00 pm. The restaurant didn't seem very busy but our waitress was clearly overwhelmed with our party. Slow off the bat and slow at keep drinks refilled. What was frustrating was that there always seemed to be 4 employees standing around not doing anything. At one point there were about 10 empty plates on our table that needed to be removed and a group of employees was literally standing next to our table. Several of them looked at the table and clean up. Later when a food runner dropped off some of main courses I politely asked him to take some of the plates and he had an attitude, he scoffed but he took them. Regarding the food, the crab dip was good. The egg rolls were wack. The bread to start was decent. Rock hard butter but decent bread. My main course was a bacon cheese burger. I think it was called the bacon bacon burger. Asked for it medium rare, it came medium well and was not very good. Five guys is about 10 times better than that burger. Fries were good but not hot. The highlight of the evening was the macadamia nut cheese cake. If it weren't for the cheesecake I would never return. Next time I would literally only order the cheesecake.

Samantha N.,"Rockville, MD",48,25,5,1.0,10/1/2016,"I'm so confused right now... sat down for a nice lunch, and an hour and a half later, I'm still waiting to receive food because the first dish (orange chicken) tasted like fried soap. The manager, whose name I don't know because he did not introduce himself when he weirdly came to our table, stared at us, and simply said ""I'm sorry,"" and walked away. What kind of manager is this? Huh? Who are you? Do you care about our experience? Do you want to make it better?  We won't be returning. Your service is absolutely horrid. Review updated: I just asked for the manager's name. His name is Amos and he needs to return to management training, ASAP. Your waitress (Sabrina)however was really nice, prompt, and attentive. Maybe she should be a manager? Your General Manager Liz, is absolutely wonderful and a breath of fresh air. She literally changed my mind about giving this place another try. Thanks for coming over and talking with us. On our way out, Amos looked at us and kept walking like nothing ever happened. Wow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=40
Amanda I.,"Cabin John, MD",21,87,120,4.0,2/20/2016,"Recently I have just been getting desserts here! The service depends on the server, I come pretty late at night so they sometimes rush me. Some servers are really friendly, I had one that was more on the rude side.. My friend always gets coffee and it is always hot, which is obviously good.  I have gotten Linda's fudge cake, this is super moist and served with three dollops of whipped cream. It has a rich chocolate ganache frosting on top and layered in between, I do wish there was more between though. There is a thin layer of the ganache on the backside of the cake too and this part is covered in chocolate chips, which add a nice crunch. I would definitely recommend this cake to someone looking for chocolate cake here. My personal favorite dessert here so far is the Godiva fudge brownie sundae. This comes with 3 triangles of rich fudge like brownie, 2 scoops of ice cream with dollops of whipped cream on top, some fudge sauce and 2 chocolate squares. I love how big this dessert is! I do eat the whole thing by myself (I have a very big sweet tooth!) but it could definitely be shared with 2 or 3 people... probably more but I wouldn't share with more than one lol. I love that the brownie is so dense and fudgy and the vanilla ice cream goes so well with it, I am drooling now.... I got the pumpkin cheesecake. The texture was good and the crust was nice and crisp. There was a big dollop of whipped cream on top and on the plate that went well with the smooth cheesecake. My problem with this was the size, compared to the brownie sundae it is significantly smaller and I didn't feel satisfied after. But this is coming from a sweetaholic. The apple crumble is big topped with ice cream and whipped cream. The crumble part is really good when it mixes with the apple ""goo"" it almost has a cake batter texture and there are also walnuts in there to keep some crunch. However I thought this dessert was a little too sweet, I would not be able to eat half of it because of that.  Let's talk about some savory food! Pasta da vinci is super yum! This is probably my favorite dish here. It is penne pasta tossed in a madeira wine sauce that is super creamy and decadent and it has 2 kinds of mushrooms in the dish as well as chicken. This is a very hearty and comfort food meal that I love! The Chicken stuffed tortillas are also good, however sometimes inconsistent. I have gotten these probably 3 times and once there was barely any chicken in the tortillas and then another time they were more stuffed with chicken. This comes with a corn cake that is very good (we usually ask for extra!) The cake is a little sweet and crisp on the outside from the grill and soft on the inside- these never disappoint! They also come with a tomatillo sauce, which we get more of this too because it adds a ton of flavor. It is a little tart and tangy I would say. The tortillas come with a huge side of black beans. The BBQ ranch chicken salad is not the best salad. It comes with a lot of different things on top, but there wasn't enough of any of them to make the salad make sense. It almost felt like there was too much going on and not enough of any one thing. The toppings are split up into sections. So there was chicken in one section with the BBQ topping. The chicken when I got the salad was dry, so that was disappointing. There was a small amount of tomato, corn and beans in the salad (which I never thought I would use small describing a cheesecake factory dish!) And then on top of everything were these thin cut fried onions, there were a lot of the onions and they were really good, but I wish everything else had more too.  The Chinese chicken salad is pretty good. The dressing is delicious and I like the addition of the mandarin oranges and slivered almonds for some crunch. The salad has way too many of the crisp rice noodles that taste like Styrofoam. Other than the noodles I would say this is one of the better salads here. The tossed greens salad is actually good for being so simple. It is just lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sliced zucchini and sliced beets. You get to choose your dressing and we usually get the skinnylicious balsamic, which has a lot of flavor for being a skinny dressing. I like this simple salad as an accompaniment to an entrée.  The cheese pizza is one star- it tastes like one of those fake cheese pizzas from my childhood. The cheese is cheap tasting. The marinara is ok (we sometimes get charged $2 for an extra small side of marinara and sometimes don't). I would not recommend the cheese pizza here. However, the bbq chicken pizza is on point! This pizza has the right amount of bbq as the sauce and a good amount of cheese and chicken. While it is probably the same cheese they use on the original cheese pizza it must go better with the tangy bbq and chicken. I have gotten this a few times and would get it again! The crust is ok nothing special but it's decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=40
Diamond L.,"Chesapeake Beach, MD",0,28,2,2.0,10/17/2017,Just left this location all I wanted was some pumpkin cheesecake. When I arrived it was a lady waiting in front of me then once the waiter was finished with this customer she asked a man standing to the right of me did he need anything he said he was waiting for take out she then proceeded to clean/fix the whipped cream machine that was not working. Finally after waiting another lady walked up and after she gave the customers their carryout items she helped me. after I paid she told me the cheesecake was frozen but would thaw out after about 20 minutes. If I would have known I was purchasing a frozen cheesecake I would not have brought it. 35 minutes later I am home and my cheese cake is icy in the middle.

Little did he know that it is branded after an actual restaurant. For one of our father/daughter dinner date, I knew I had to show him there's more to the world than plain cheesecake!  Before we dived right into desserts, we did have a proper, ginormous dinner -  mac and cheese burger and pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. For a chain restaurant, I'm very impressed by Cheesecake Factory! The burger/sandwich were well made (plus on quantity, plus on the quality too). The burger patty was juicy, the layer of fried mac and cheese was gooey and crunchy -  I wasn't surprised that my dad devoured the entire burger in one seating. My pulled pork sandwich - perfectly toasted bun, saucy delicious meat on top of meat, topped with their creamy Cole Slaw - forget trying to save room for dessert! And did I mention their sweet potato fries were fried perfectly? One of the best sweet potato fries I've had - straight from the fryer and yet not one bit greasy!  We wrapped our dinner date by sharing the perfect treat - Godiva chocolate cheesecake - 3 combined layers of perfection: brownie cake, chocolate mousse, and Godiva cheesecake.

I know things move fast when we engage the manager as I explained earlier.

Bread came out around 6:35 with the butter and ketchup.. 23 minutes after our initial request.  Looking around baffled at the service we were getting from her, compared to the 2 tables around us where she was treating them like gods... We were very disappointed. One could consider this discrimination as we were the only non-Caucasian table she was servicing (from what I could see).  Anyways, it was hard to tip when we paid the check. Sadly we gave up 11% because her tip obviously gets split among others. If she was the only one to get a tip, 0% would be a very high tip in my opinion...

Vicki C.,"Clarksburg, MD",119,181,9,1.0,12/23/2013,"Be prepared to wait for the whole night.... I've always seem to favor the Cheesecake Factory but until this past experience, I will not visit this restaurant again especially this new location in Montgomery Mall. Our party of seven arrived at 7:50pm and was told a 40 minute wait. We didn't mind as much since the mall was open and we roamed around. After our 40 minute wait was up, we checked with the hostess twice in between to see how much longer the wait would be. The response wasn't very clear but we thought we would wait it our just a bit longer until we threw in the towel. It wasn't until 9pm we were finally called for our table.  Our seven guests were escorted to a table for six. Our seventh guest asked the host if we could pull a chair from an empty table right next to us instead of standing awkwardly while everyone else was seated. The host replies with ""that's going to an issue because we will need that chair for that table."" UHH what type of response is that? Mind you nobody sat at the empty table next to use the whole night!!  Starved and now parched we were excited to order drinks and appetizers. The waitress we had was friendly but as for service... not so great. Our appetizers came before our drinks, which in my book is a big no no. We were all digging into the bread, chips, and dip but dying of thirst for water. We had to wait until half way through until she brought our drinks.  We put our entree orders in and waited a long while before it came as well. A manager came over and informed us it was just going to be another minute before the food came out. By then it was 9:40pm until our entrees arrived. The gang ordered mostly appetizers as an entree which was a huge portion for an entree alone. I had clearly ordered a chopped salad with no chicken and when my salad came... surprise, there was chicken! I informed the waitress and she quickly took it back and I waited about five minutes while watching my friends dig in until my chicken-less salad came back. The funny comment the waitress said was ""I took the bacon out too and saved the day!"" One of our friends mumbled you would have saved the day if you didn't bring the chicken out in the first place. No apology whatsoever.  The food was average and overpriced. The tex mex eggrolls and sweet corm tamale cakes apparently are a hit with a few friends. The buffalo blast which is Chicken, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing, is NOT a winner. It's shredded chicken and then overly battered and fried, which was one hot mess and artery clogger. After two, the guys felt their chest hurting a little from all the grease. My chopped salad could have had more flavor but I wouldn't have paid $11.50 for it.  After our entrees were cleared we ordered coffee and of course cheesecake. Most of us shared with one another but it took more than15 minutes for them to make the cheesecakes from scratch I mean, grab it from the fridge. Splitting the bill was very difficult. Meals were all over the place on different bills. The waitress clearly acknowledged she had put some things on the wrong check. Good thing, our group of friends were understanding and most of us just paid each other back instead of having the waitress fix it... which by the way she didn't even offer.  In conclusion  Cons: -Service is SLOW -Waitress was not tentative -Food is greasy, flavorless, and overpriced Pros: -The cheesecake is still awesome By the time we paid and left it was 11pm... between one hour of waiting and two hours of service or lack of service..

Julie H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",31,144,349,4.0,2/19/2015,"So glad that Cheesecake Factory relocated to Montgomery Mall, its more convenient to go to and always a good place to stop in after some shopping. I find that this restaurant is a lot smaller than the one at White Flint, but there's also an ""outside"" area that allows you to sit out in the mall area. The service here is pretty quick, and the staff are friendly. I've waited some time to write a review even though I went here on opening week and it was awful (but I returned and its back to the same Cheesecake Factory that I know). The first week that I came here, three of us ordered a pasta dish and red velvet cheesecake. Each and every one of your pasta dishes was extremely extremely salty. It was awful. We got it as carry out, so we couldn't really say anything. It was unbearable to eat. The cheesecake was excellent. After a few additional times visiting Cheesecake Factory, and reordering their pasta - its back to normal and not the salty dish that we first got when we went there. My favorite pasta at Cheesecake Factory is their Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. I also enjoy the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. The portion is large enough to make me full and is really sauce and great with their brown bread.

Chris P.,"Silver Spring, MD",13,75,1,3.0,1/5/2014,"WTH...NO FLAVOR?!?! OK, for what it's worth the new location is just fine--over at White Flint it was guaranteed I'd have to wait 30 minutes or more for a table. Now, not a problem...and I wonder why people are complaining about parking. Really? Maybe around Christmas time you would. Not now. So....what about the food? That should count more, right? Yes indeed, and I'm disappointed. I had Moroccan Chicken with couscous and onion rings. The chicken had no flavor, the couscous had no flavor and the onion rings...Holy shiiiiite! No flavor. Is this on purpose? Real grilled chicken would have some kind of flavor, which makes me think it's some microwaved crap purchased from Target. (Then again, frozen chicken from Target, Giant, etc., usually HAS some flavor!)...and even I know how to add something to couscous. But the onion rings---THAT is unforgivable. Perhaps their chefs should learn from the ones at the Rockville Ale House, because THEY know how to make 'em. $5 for onion rings = BETTER HAVE THE FLAVOR. *sigh* The cappuccinos and the vanilla bean cheesecake were fantastic. And like I said the new location is a few steps up from the old one at White Flint.

What's up with a HORRIBLE grueling wait for a place that's a step up from Applebee's? Is it because the portions are so large that you could make three meals out of one? Anyway, once your buzzer goes off...you think ""Oh now I can sit down!"" WRONG! That's the first part of your wait. You then get herded off to another area for the second part of your wait. You look around and wonder why this is the case. This is especially true since there seemed to be many empty tables in the place. We ended up getting seated out in the hallway of the mall at 9:30 p.m. All in all I won't be back, it's a complete joke.

Anthony C.,"Bethesda, MD",18,330,51,3.0,4/15/2014,"The wire bound menu of just about anything ever cooked. CorprAte eating at its best.

But my salad was good and even though the place was jam-packed with shoppers it was a pleasant enough meal.  CF is one of those places that is hard to avoid--you end up there in a variety of circumstances. And my objection is not based on some foodie-centric view of the world where everything is locally grown and the mixed greens are, basically, weeds. No, when you succumb to the chain-sit down service restaurants you deprive  yourself of the chance to eat something more interesting.

The saving grace was the wonderful server and the food.  We came in and put our names down for a table for two and were told there was a 40 minute wait. So the a friend and I were waiting and waiting and almost an hour passed, and I started to notice people that came after us were being called. Uh. My friend walked up to the hostesses and asked what was going on, and the one who took the name down said they had the name down wrong (it's Sean, not Shaw -_-) and that we missed our table and they'd called us again. Alright that's their mistake but whatever, so about five minutes later the hostesses (three of them) started screaming ""SHAW! SHAW! Your table is ready!"" So he sighed and just walked up and the hostess he talked to looked like she had never seen him before. And then he goes ""I was just here like five minutes ago, you had my name wrong"" and they all go ""OHHHH no wonder you didn't come forward for your table!"" Okay, I was pissed to the max. Even after someone corrects you you still get it wrong? Someone needs to fix that, or them. I almost walked out. As we're being seated, I notice there's still a bill on the table from the previous diners. Annoying. The server was so sweet and nice I started feeling better and then we actually enjoyed the night. I ordered the Steak Diane and he got Farfalle with Chicken and Garlic and both were delicious! The Steak Diane has this amazing sauce with mushrooms and it's *definitely* drool worthy!! We finished off dinner with a tiramisu and chocolate tuxedo cheesecake which were a perfect night cap. Everything was pretty big in portions too, I ate about half my tiramisu before I gave up because my tummy was just packed haha.

Like a stylized version of a place from the 20's or 30's with low lighting, wood panels, and cool, jazzy music. Mosaic tiles hung on the walls and created a sleek , contemporary feel to the space. The servers also wear crisp white shirts. It makes for a great look. On this trip, I sat at the bar and ordered a turkey and avocado sandwich and a cold apple cider. The sandwich was on the small side and the cidar wasn't ""ice cold"" as advertised but I was OK with that for the most part. The bar is too small but small tables behind it give one more space to sit. The bar does have frosted bar taps for the beer. HUGE ! LOVE THAT !!! It was awesome to see.

I made sure I informed the cashier that I have an onion allergy, hence why I ordered the pasta without onions and peppers. The cashier said my order would take 15min. It actually took 30min. When I did get my food, I could see almost immediately that there was an onion in my pasta. I took the food out of the bag and showed the cashier. The cashier called the manager and the manager said no that's not onion, it's cilantro. Then I said no, it's an onion (pointing to the obvious onion in the dish). Manager then proceeds to say no, that's asparagus. I then take the plastic fork from the Cheesecake bag and pick up the onion. The manager asks if I wanted another one. I say no because there is a clear case of cross contamination at this location. If someone says that they are allergic to something, every effort in the kitchen should be made to make sure the food is free from said allergen. The manager gave me my money back stating that the entire purchase would be refunded to my card. The manager leaves and then the cashier hands me another receipt for $8 and some change. I asked what this was for. She says it's for the Cheesecake. I said no, your boss said my ENTIRE purchase would be refunded. Why should there now be a balance that clearly exceeds the original tab of $22.23? They wanted me to pay for the Cheesecake but give my the entire refund? The hell?? Makes no sense.

Once a week my husband and I have date day. He usually wants to go here. The food is great but it would be nice just once to not be forced to sit in the bar.  We've asked to sit in the dining room.

It's our one day to have a nice lunch and every time we are sat in the bar.  That being said, the salmon lunch special is great. Juicy salmon cooked to perfection. Hubby likes it with mashed potatoes and carrots.  The meatloaf is a HUGE portion even on the lunch size and is better than my mom makes (sorry momma).  Lately I've been getting the Cobb salad no bacon and cannot finish the lunch size. Last week when I was almost finished I bit into a big chunk of pork (bacon). I cannot eat pig for religious reasons and was very upset that it seemed they caught their mistake and picked most of the bacon out. But not all.

Ebie B.,"Chevy Chase, MD",170,86,2,2.0,2/16/2016,"Cheesecake Factory- where everyone is confused, all the time, always. I honestly think they use the shock value of huge portions to distract you from mediocre food punctuated by the mostly wtf service. But a huge plate of greasy fish is still greasy fish. Most recently I went here to pick up a to-go order on Sunday. Yes it was Valentines Day, but I have never experienced a more chaotic mixture of overwhelmed staff, poor planning and horrible time management, even on New Years Eve. There were many tables open that the staff seemed unaware of and I heard a lot of complaining from patrons about the wait.  So I go to pick up my order. There is a huge line. It is slowly merging with another line. No one seems to know where either of these lines lead. I didn't know if I was waiting in a line to pick up food or get a table. Neither did the people in front of me. Finally a staff member assured me I was in the correct line and that although the line was long, they had 2 registers open so it should be moving quickly. Lies. They DID have both open but only 1 was in use. The other served as a prop for one of the employees to stand in front of, doing nothing. In the entire 17 decades I was in line for, I saw her pick up 1 paper bag, put it in the fridge and then continue to stand there. The same line is for people placing an order as it is for picking one up, which makes no sense. I finally get my food. It ranged from lukewarm and greasy to just plain cold. Some of the fish was almost inedible. $20 wasted. Thanks guys.  The restaurant itself looks very nice. It's kind of small and very cramped inside. Outside there is a nice little roped off area inside the mall with stellar views of the Foot Reflexology place. They have made the best use possible of the space outside, and it really looks quite nice. However I'm not inclined to go back anytime soon.

Preet M.,"Clarksburg, MD",1157,103,60,4.0,9/4/2014,"Service: This is the only reason I take off a star, and even this is not applicable to all guests. My parents are vegetarians who love Mexican food.  Naturally, the giant ""Burrito Supreme"" called out to them. Only problem was that it had chicken in it. We asked the waitress who was assigned to us the first time we went there whether or not it could be made without chicken. She told us that the chicken inside the burrito could be removed, but the sauce was marinated in a chicken broth. Over the last seven times we have been there as a family, we have received a different answer to the same question every time. Some hosts say that there is no broth used, while others say that we can replace the sauce entirely. For that reason alone, I remove a star. Our most recent waiter, and its a shame that I forgot his name, was absolutely amazing. He was of Asian-american descent and was extremely friendly/ready to help. Food: I personally love every dish I have ordered here. Its nice to see that there is at least one restaurant left that doesn't skimp on quantity. Portions are huge and I highly recommend the factory nachos as an appetizer to share. I also love how there is now a calorie count for each dish. Most of my friends who count calories gawk at the four digit numbers next to many of the dishes. I just sit there like ""I ain't even mad."" All of the cheesecakes are delicious, however I have run into a few instances where they are not available as slices, especially towards the ened of the day.  Environment: It is a dimly lit restaurant with tons of artwork all around...even the ceiling is painted intricately. The restaurant is loud. Bottom line...it always is packed and the great thing is, regardless of how packed it is, I have never had to wait more than 20 minutes to be seated. This may not apply come holiday season, labor day, etc. but still very impressive in my honest opinion.  I would be more than happy to give the restaurant five stars, if someone could just answer once and for all, can the burrito be ordered without any meat whatsoever?

I love coming here because my food is usually done right, taste great and my service is nine times out of ten on point. Today my mother and I went to have lunch. We got there just as soon as it was opening and were seated promptly. The staff is friendly and always professional when I have dealt with them. My first order was one of my favorites the strawberry lemonade, but when it was brought to me it tasted terrible. At first I told the waitress and told her not to bother as to not seem rude. But she promptly fixed it and brought me a fresh glass made from a different bottle. I decided to forgo getting more strawberry lemonade and went for the decadent Dulce de Leche milkshake (not for the weight concious) I proceeded to order the Dynamite Shrimp with dipping sauce which I love. My mother ordered another one of our favorites which are the crab bites. I also recommend the buffalo blasts, popcorn shrimp, buffalo wings, dumplings, and my utmost favorite the calamari. We both ordered the shrimp scampi (mine with no tomato extra garlic) and that came out piping hot and with a little kick. This time the kitchen added some hot pepper making it even more tasty. My other favorite meals are the Thai Chicken, Chicken Picatta, Beef ribs (which was removed from the menu), and the Orange chicken. We decided to forgo dessert we were so full by then. I loved the atmosphere it can be a little loud but you can carry on a comfortable conversation if need be. The ambience is always soothing.

My absolute favorite here: AVOCADO SPRING ROLLS.  Mmmm...but I love avocados (I went through a period where I was going through 3 a week...just eating them with a bit of salt and black pepper).  Anyhoo, I do enjoy these things.  I also really like the barbecue chicken salad, but I've begun to make that at home instead of paying $10+ for barely $2 of ingredients.  Their cheesecakes are obviously yummy...I think my favorite for over a decade has been the tiramisu. I'm not absolutely certain, but I don't think they use real cream for their whipped cream - because I tried to put some in my coffee and it didn't dissolve.  Not a fan of not using real ingredients.  Whipped oil is not good eats.

My husband and I went here today at 3:00pm (not lunch, not dinner--lunner), and we still had to wait 10 minutes. They really pack people in here, and the tables are very close together, so it gets very loud. We've had so many things on the menu and have pretty much enjoyed everything.

Su K.,"Washington, DC",229,428,582,2.0,5/19/2008,"For the life of me, I can't understand why there is always a wait here. For one, I've never seen too many shoppers in White Flint Mall at any given time so it's not like the clientle are shoppers looking to grab a bite b/c the food court sucks, which it does. Second, you can literally rub elbows with Rockville's elite (and not so elite). The tables are so closely spaced, you'd think you asked for a table for 30. Some of you may argue that, ""Hey! They have booths you know!"" Fair enough. But you generally have to wait even longer for a booth and the booths are made in such a manner that you can definitely feel the nervous diner behind you tapping their feet as their date takes a turn for the worse. Third, the wait is ridiculous. I'll wait for many things but not 30-50 minutes for $15 pasta and $10 burgers. And if White Flint were a mall you could actually do some shopping in, the buzzers would help. Most times, I find that people receive a buzzer and either go to Border's, but not too far into it in fear of the buzzer going out of range, or just wait in the lobby of the mall or Cheesecake. One reviewer stated they take reservations, but every time I've called they told me that they do not. Seeing how busy it is, I doubt a reservation system would be in their best interest. Food - All gripes aside, the Thai Lettuce Wraps are fantastic, the Cajun Jambalaya is overrated, and if your namesake is a factory of an item, said item better be dang good, and it is! My favorite is the black-raspberry truffle. Mmmmmm!!! The brown bread with the oats on it is sweet and soft while the sourdough is a wee bit too sour for me. Service - How do them mugs manage to work in a restaurant and keep their all-white uniforms completely free of stains? Either they use some stainguard that can cause numerous forms of cancer and should not be used if you are pregnant, expecting to become pregnant, or nursing, or they've become experts at navigating the really tight confines of the Rockville Cheesecake. Location - It's in White Flint Mall. Apparently, people only go here for Cheesecake or Bertucci's if they'd rather wait 15 minutes rather than 50. If you've got 3 hours to kill before whatever it is you were planning on doing in Rockville, if that plan didn't include an hour visit to Border's, I definitely recommend this place for the good food.

Once we were seated the hostess was borderline rude when we asked for different table.  I felt this was a very legitimate request consider one of our party was 8 months pregnant and wanted to sit in a booth and not a chair.  The hostess however, did not. I ordered Fettucini Alfredo, with a few changes, whichthe waiter was helpful with, however I was then informed that they were out of fettucini noodles, which I found slightly odd. The single worst part of the dining experience had to be when the appetizers arrived.  About three waiters arrived, one woman was so rude that it was ridiculous.  She had apparently not thought to pick up the plate of Nachos with a napking and said that it was hot.  We were at a tiny table and were trying to make room for her when she got exasperated, started moving our food around and then threw the plate on the table and walked away.

And yes, the cheesecake is absolutely scrumptious, but as for their lunch/dinner menus? Nothing special.  Their portion sizes are enormous but as far as quality goes, not worth my money.

Menu is very pricey during dinner just to forwarn you. Chicken fettucine alfredo I had was $18.......   Great serving size and it was good, but a little too on the garlic-y side for my taste.

I can't say esactly what made me sick, but my date was okay, he didn't get sick... He got the Jambalaya pasta which was tasty also, the chicken and shrimp in it were on point.   We got the Turtle cheesecake, with chocolate, pecans, and caramel, which was really good, but really rich, and one slice is $8, and plenty for 2 people, maybe 3!

Passion C.,"District Heights, MD",279,192,83,4.0,6/1/2011,"I went to Happy Hour early evening on a Friday (about 4pm) and sat in the bar area. We ended up there after getting seated and the waitress told us that the amazing Happy Hour specials were only available in the bar area. Which kind of sucks (-1/2 star). So we relocated.  The bar was pretty packed already and was filling up pretty quickly. This meant a very busy server.  He worked as efficiently as he could because there were so many people to tend to. But there wasnt much time for any personal attention. But I guess its hard to have amazing service at such a popular restaurant.  The Highlights: $5 Long Islands and Mojitos. I am a bartender and that long island was easily one of the best ones I've ever tasted. My bf had their electric pink lemonade or whatever its called and it was excellent. You couldnt taste an ounce of liquor. And we were both quite a bit past tipsy after only 2 drinks there! Half off appetizers. We had the Calamari. No complaints there. STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE FOR DESSERT! Cant leave here without it. The wait staff was even nice enough to hold it in the refrigerator for us while we shopped. The entrees: I had Pecan Crusted Salmon, absolutely delicious, with some type of shrimp scampi. It was a combination platter. And the shrimp I couldve actually done without (I didnt expect it to be fried -1/2 star). I only ate about 1/3 of my food after getting pretty full off drinks, appetizers, and bread. My bf got the Chicken Madeira and he damn near ate it all. I think that the wonderful thought of having leftovers later that night kept him from finishing it.

Nothing wrong with doing well with specific demographic groups.   The Cheesecake Factory staff was nice every step of the way. From the hostess not questioning my excuse for why the rest of my group was late (I said they were parking, which in a sense was true because everyone is in the state of parking until they arrive)...to the waitress being very patient and good humored with my family.  Honestly, beyond my problems with the Factory contributing to nationwide obesity, the food is usually pretty good. Ridiculously long menu, but at least there are choices. I settled on the seared tuna salad, which was good but not great. The very popular lettuce wraps were fine as the table seemed to like them. It would be helpful to note on the menu that peanuts are sprinkled over the chicken just in case anyone is allergic (Ahem). We split two slices of cheesecake for the table. The chocolate coconut was a bit too sweet, but the red velvet white chocolate was unamimously praised. The texture of the white chocolate went nicely with the creamy soft cheesecake and decent red velvet layers. Everyone liked their meal, a feat not to be taken lightly considering the tough crowd.

Anyway, a few observations: --Am I the only one who thinks that ""factory"" is just not an appetizing name for an eating establishment? --With a menu this big, I would not expect anything to be that fabulous. --Service was, overall, good.  My three dining compatriots had plenty of requests, and most of them the servers had no problem filling.  --I was, however, chagrined to see our waitress chomping on gum.  Not exactly professional. --The salmon lunch special was a good deal -- more than one person can/should eat (salmon plus 2 sides) for only $12.95. --The salmon was overdone, and too salty.  As other people have mentioned, everything here seems to be oversalted....I was thirsty the rest of the afternoon. --If one lived in a place with few dining options, I could understand the appeal of CF.  But when you're on Rockville Pike, and a short drive from  Bethesda, I just don't get it.  That - however - is not surprising, as there are plenty of things in this life I just don't understand!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=260

The wait though is a bit much.  Once, we waited over an hour for dinner on a weekday night, while several other parties who came after us were seated (we were a party of 6, but still).  Thankfully the manager comped us appetizers after we complained, since they kept telling us that it'd just be another 15 minutes...  3 times in a row.  You do have to make an effort to get there early or at off times in order to avoid a long wait, which I'm willing to do if the food is stellar at a place...  But it's not here.  It's not bad, but it's not the late lamented Colorado Kitchen or Yuraku.

Cheesecake is a chain restaurant, but it's one of the best chain restaurants in the country. From its huge portions... (who complains about big plates? take it to work the next day) to its big menu which contains food from every direction in the sense that you can be in the mood for any type of food and it will be on that menu. The service is always A+, the waiting list is always long but that has a lot to say about a restaurant that doesnt take reservations and is always, always packed.. I love this place because everyone can agree that they will find something on the menu. Everytime I order something new, it is an adventure. I have never had anything that I did not like. I am the type of person who likes to stick to the same plates because I don't like to walk out unsatisfied but that has never happened at Cheesecake and I hope I dont jinx it because I am trying something new tonight :) The cheesecakes are better than any I have ever tasted, offcourse their specialties are cheesecakes and they do a hell of a good job on them. There are soo many varieties of cheesecakes its euphoric. My favorite plates: Avocado egg rolls with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce.

I got the Saigon Grilled Chicken Sandwich which is their version of a Banh Mi which came on a very chewy, thick crusted baguette which was a workout to chew though the flavours were good as was the peanut dipping sauce that came with it.

I have eaten several times at the White Flint location with good service and tasty entrees. My family had never been to a CKF and thought that while they were visiting would be a nice treat for lunch. Waiter was friendly/polite but took too long an everything and got the order wrong, so my hub ended up with a poblano pepper instead of the poblano hamburger meal! The other items were okay, nothing to write home about.  The wrong order caused huge delay in getting served.  To make matters worse the bill arrived with the additional cost of the poblano pepper. I would have expected the waiter to have inspected the bill, especially in light of the mistake. For some reason the magnetic strip on our credit card didnt work in their machine (no problem in the Apple store in same mall ) so the waiter had to key in by hand; no problem but this took 45 minutes (ended lunch 1:04p walked out 1:47p). After my hub signed the bill the waiter stated that he needed the card again so an imprint could be made...this all sounds very unusual??? I will be keeping my receipt and monitoring my CC activity.  Did I mention they were not that busy.  So what should have taken an hour to get a simple meal, took almost two hours!!!

Quick, starch and salt filled food, expensive drinks, and slices of cheesecake which contain more calories than an average adult needs in a week. There is nothing about this location that is any different than any other location except for that it's at Montgomery Mall rather than Anymall USA.  Decent place for a girls night out if you feel like treating yourself to martinis and cheesecake. Okay place if you're in high school and want to go on a ""fancy"" date. Expect a lot of noise, people with massive amounts of shopping bags and to leave feeling full, bloated, and probably a little worse about yourself after consuming a 5000 calorie meal.  Service is usually on point, and despite the lines you can usually get a table in 20 minutes or so.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=120

Margaret Z.,"Manhattan, United States",260,730,78,4.0,21/7/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory was recently implanted at Montgomery Mall near Old Navy after moving from its old home, White Flint Mall (RIP). I wasn't completely thrilled to come here after having a mediocre experience at a CF in Jersey, but was willing to give this a try.  To my surprise, this place was PACKED for a Monday night and there was a 15 minute wait for 3 people. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and I really appreciated that the seats were far enough apart to not feel cramped. The ambience is really nice and what I like to call ""classy casual"".  It took longer than usual for the waiter to get around with bread and water, but he was super friendly which made up for it. He got our drink orders in quickly and we didn't have to wait long before our orders arrived at the table. I ordered something off the ""Skinnylicious"" menu because I was shocked that most of the entrees on the regular menu were close to 2000 calories - usually my entire daily intake. My girlfriend was ambitious and opted for the carbonara pasta (2500 cals!!) while our other guy friend got the chicken with biscuits. His looked really good and HUGE... the plate was loaded with a heaping serving of mashed potatoes, a large homestyle biscuit, and chicken with some veggies scattered about.  My entree was the chicken pasta - gremelli (skinny spirals - I had to Google this at the table) with marinara sauce, tomatoes, and grilled chicken. The portion size was perfect and I felt very comfortably full at the end of my meal, with room to spare for dessert. The chicken was seasoned well though slightly dry for my taste. The pasta itself could've been cooked a little more, but I prefer more tender pasta to ""al dente"" so I probably should have specified. All in all, it tasted healthy and was exactly what I wanted - plus it was only 500 calories!  We also ordered the Oreo cheesecake to split... though I ended up having to take 2 bites and pack the rest because my friends were stuffed. It is very rich and chocolatey but extremely delicious... honestly all of the cheesecakes I've had here have been divine, so it's good to know the chain is living up to its namesake.  I don't recommend the sangria, however, because it was extremely watered down and tasted too citrusy. The beer and wine are better values.  Our waiter was very attentive and prompt throughout the entire night, checking on us periodically and making sure we were happy with our meal. He was also really patient when we needed a long time to decide on our dessert. This location is a great addition to Montgomery Mall and I would be more than happy to come back!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=120

Angela W.,"Baltimore, United States",21,63,41,5.0,8/8/2015,"I love The Cheesecake Factory in general. From the portions size to the cool decor to the crazy amount of options, this place is my go-to for a casual lunch with a friend (especially, in this location, if I'm shopping).  I *highly* recommend the ""Pasta Da Vinci"" - it's so delicious and the sauce they use is unique from the usual alfredo and marinara sauces you usually find with pastas. It's made with a delicious wine reduction that makes my taste buds dance.  The crabcake sandwich is pretty delicious as well, though I'm not sure how much of it is actually crab meat and not filling - but I'm a lover of all crab cakes! The service can be pretty slow during the dinner rush, but my lunch experience today was excellent. The place opens for lunch at 11:30am and we got there at 12:15am - immediately seated and experienced decently prompt service. They are very accommodating of certain things you want modified with your meal, such as extra sauce or more thoroughly cooked pasta.  Overall, I love this place. I feel a bit guilty about how many calories I just ate when I'm leaving but hey, I always pack leftovers!  Tip: Make sure you ask for more bread to pack as well.

Starr C.,"McLean, United States",128,294,427,5.0,3/6/2012,"I was here a few months ago catching up with some old friends. (Basically, ever since the beginning of my relationship, I was told that the entire ""crew"" would eat at Cheesecake one day. This was that day.) We had a phenomenal server who was just super awesome. I regret forgetting his name and not writing it down, but he was fantastic. A lot of fun but very professional. He made sure we had a great time. The boy and I are huge eaters, so we ordered the roadslide sliders to start. We wolfed them down like animals because we were hungry, but they weren't quite slider-sized. They were actually almost exactly the size of a McDonald's plain hamburger, but a bit tastier. Nothing particularly outstanding, but they did the job they were supposed to do, which was help stave off hunger while making the other couples who didn't order appetizers hungrier. =P I ordered one of the specials that day, the barbecued salmon. It was VERY good, and I'm glad it was one of the specials because I was going to otherwise order the regular grilled salmon. The sweetness of the barbecue sauce was delicious on the salmon. Accompanied by a giant mountain of yummy-in-my-tummy mashed potatoes (seriously, that thing was the size of a softball), crispy thin onion rings (more like onion strings but ring-shaped), on a bed of corn succotash, I believe? Very tasty. And of course, our table totally demolished the bread offered with as much decorum as we could muster. The boy had the chipotle pasta which he didn't seem to love. It was also an overwhelming portion. Some friends ordered the hibachi steak and they seemed to LOVE it. Most of us were way too stuffed for dessert, but the people who ordered cheesecake got it quite fast. I definitely had a fantastic time here. I like that the portions are quite filling, considering the higher price tags on the items here.  Good good good good good food. So good.

Lea K.,"Clarksburg, United States",12,7,4,2.0,11/3/2015,"I'm writing this review a month late because I wanted to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  I loved the Cheesecake Factory when it was located in White Flint.  I used to be one of those crazy people that would wait 2-3 hours for a table.  I used to also order to go when I couldn't wait in those lines.   Now for my recent experience.  On New Year's Eve, I ordered to go.  I drove 30 minutes to Montgomery Mall to pick up my food.  When I got there, the individual that brought my food out told me that my cheesecake was not quite ready since they had to put strawberries on it.  I waited an additional 10 minutes and even tipped the server  extra for bringing my food out to my car.  Because it took so long for my cheesecake to come out, I did not check it.  When I got home, I opened the box only to find a frozen cheesecake without any of the toppings they were supposedly putting on it while I wait an extra 10 minutes.  I called the restaurant and the manager was kind enough to give us a cheesecake for my husband to pick up on his way home without making us bring back the other.   Fast forward to February 14th, my husband picked up food for Valentine's Day so we can have a nice dinner in with our kids.  Again, Cheesecake made a mistake with our order.  They charged us for a dessert item but did not include it in the bag.  I called the manager and she took down my address and name and told me she would be sending us a gift card in place of the dessert.  I thanked her and waited for the gift card. It's now been a month and no gift card.  My low rating is for the poor customer service at the counter when we picked up the food, the mistakes with the dessert, and finally for the lack of the manager following through on her promise to send us a gift card.  I can honestly say I will never order take out from Cheesecake again and probably would not set foot into their restaurant.  I no longer have the patience to wait 2-3 hours for a seat in a restaurant that does not take care of its customers.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=120

Connie M.,"Rockville, United States",290,203,507,4.0,12/12/2013,"What can i say about Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said? Giant portions and the most delicious cheesecake!!! Now that they print their calorie count (which has to hurt since the portions are ginormous), I am guessing that is why they came up with their ""Skinnylicious menu"". Yay!! We started off with their skinny summer rolls ($7). I'm not sure if you could make summer rolls any skinnier, but they did. Delicate Rice Paper Rolled Around Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Carrots, Rice Noodles, Green Onion, Cilantro and Shrimp with a peanut dipping sauce as well as a chili, soy one. YUM!! It was a busy Saturday night with a 40 minute wait so we scoped out the bar and managed to find a table in 10 mins. Natascha was our server and I'm not sure if she was having a bad day but she was not on point. She smiled when I smiled at her and she refilled my drink without asking but my two sisters felt neglected as she did not refill their EMPTY glasses. Granted, they were packed like usual but as I used to be a server, the bar is set pretty high (sorry guys!!) I had the Factory burrito grande ($14). I had seen facebook pictures of it and wanted to try what looked like the biggest burrito in the world!! It was packed with chicken, rice, peppers, onions, cheese and cilantro and smothered with sauce and more cheese. There was a side of black beans, guacamole and sour cream....and it was very delicious!!! But it was not as big as it was in the past...but I am glad I tried it...next time will stick with my favorites though. (I packed 1/2 of it to go so I could save room for cheesecake!!) My sister got the shepherd's pie. This NEVER DISAPPOINTS!!! Ground Beef, Mushrooms, Carrots, Peas, Zucchini and Onions in a Delicious brown Sauce  Covered with a Mashed Potato-Parmesan Cheese Crust ($15). I swear this is the best shepherd's pie I have ever eaten!!!  Even though the portion is just a tad smaller (yep, I can tell!!), it is still worth every penny. Luckily she couldn't eat it all and the baby sister and I got to help her.....nom nom nom Baby sister ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad ($18). Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared Rare with Avocado, Wasabi Pesto, Tomato and Mixed Greens with a Shallot Vinaigrette. She didn't speak much while inhaling one of the smallest salads on the menu (have you seen the others? piled high to the sky in giant bowls!!!). No one asked for a bite as we weren't sure it would fill her up (it didn't) but when she came up for air, she mumbled something about how delicious and perfectly cooked the tuna was and that the dressing was perfect.  In case you didn't know it, Cheesecake factory can actually split any dessert in half so you each get your own plate (and extra whipped cream!!!). We asked them to split the Peppermint Bark slice ($8) with half packed to take home and enjoy later. This has to be the best flavor ever invented...it reminds me of my childhood when I would eat peppermint ice cream....yum!! I almost dropped a star because Natascha brought me the check before they brought us our cheesecake, but she did bring us bread...after we asked for it and she did refill their drinks...after we asked for it. She wasn't rude. It just seemed like she was preoccupied....hope her week improves!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=120

It was good, just as you would imagine what cajun jambalaya would taste like.  It had a good amount of shrimp and chicken.  I also had some of my friend's fried zucchini. For an appetizer, this really fills you up, but it wasn't bad. A little too much breading though.   Do make sure to get the Flying Gorilla at some point! It's a spiked banana chocolate milkshake! Delicious!  And if you are here, you have to get a slice of cheesecake! They're all good! One negative for CF is their huge menu selection. I'm a foodie and it's difficult to decide what to get! Some of their items do seem repetitive though, like the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, New Orleans Shrimp, Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. All pretty much taste the same to me.

We ordered an appetizer and entrees. The appetizer came out before our water! We specifically requested lemons with our water and of course, the waiter forgot the lemons so we had to re-request them. A different person delivered our food (not the waiter) and he was fantastic. Even the bus boy was attentive and extremely diligent. We ordered a kale salad without cheese and the dressing on the side.

You can't order appetizers, drinks, sit at the bar...nothing. Make sure your party is there or you will be standing around getting hungry. 2.

I ate at the restaurant at Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, MD last night with a girlfriend. We each ordered a salad and I got a glass of sangria. When the bill came my drink vas very nearly as much as our salads - $11.50! Knowing I would not have ordered the drink if I knew it was going to be that much, I asked to see the menu to check the price. What do you know --- there were no prices next to the drinks! I did not fault the waitress but expressed my shock and asked to speak to the manager. I knew well this was a policy decision. A very youthful and inexperienced Jennifer came over and inquired. I explained my frustration. She just gazed at me. Then I was interrogated about when I realized drink prices were not listed on the menu. Really? So much for listening to the customer's concerns. She informed me that ""many restaurants are doing this now"" as if this was news. That doesn't make it ok in my opinion. I can go elsewhere. Then Manager Jennifer asked if I wanted her to take our check to the register. I said NO!  I explained that I felt not listing drink prices was misleading and rude, like I had been tricked. They could list the calories, but not the prices? More gazing by Jennifer. She finally asked what I wanted her to do. I said she could either remove the drink form my bill (if there are no prices maybe the drinks should be free?) or at least give me a discount of half for my frustration and to make me a happy customer again. She took the bill and disappeared for a few minutes. When she came back she handed me the bill with all of a $2 DISCOUNT! REALLY??? What an insult  and snub and I told her so.

My party of 2 had a 15 minutes wait for a table (no biggy), as we preferred to wait to eat here versus other restaurants inside the mall. We wanted to actually sit in the little fake ""patio"" seating which is pretty much viewing out to the mall's pathway... but the lighting was better... and we were told that this area was ""not open"" (meh =( hehe...) Typical Cheesecake, same food... so no problem there! I get the same things off the menu every single time I go, and it's always consistent.  The food was quick, and our server Landon was awesome!

Vicki C.,"Clarksburg, United States",119,181,9,1.0,23/12/2013,"Be prepared to wait for the whole night.... I've always seem to favor the Cheesecake Factory but until this past experience, I will not visit this restaurant again especially this new location in Montgomery Mall. Our party of seven arrived at 7:50pm and was told a 40 minute wait. We didn't mind as much since the mall was open and we roamed around. After our 40 minute wait was up, we checked with the hostess twice in between to see how much longer the wait would be. The response wasn't very clear but we thought we would wait it our just a bit longer until we threw in the towel. It wasn't until 9pm we were finally called for our table.  Our seven guests were escorted to a table for six. Our seventh guest asked the host if we could pull a chair from an empty table right next to us instead of standing awkwardly while everyone else was seated. The host replies with ""that's going to an issue because we will need that chair for that table."" UHH what type of response is that? Mind you nobody sat at the empty table next to use the whole night!!  Starved and now parched we were excited to order drinks and appetizers. The waitress we had was friendly but as for service... not so great. Our appetizers came before our drinks, which in my book is a big no no. We were all digging into the bread, chips, and dip but dying of thirst for water. We had to wait until half way through until she brought our drinks.  We put our entree orders in and waited a long while before it came as well. A manager came over and informed us it was just going to be another minute before the food came out. By then it was 9:40pm until our entrees arrived. The gang ordered mostly appetizers as an entree which was a huge portion for an entree alone. I had clearly ordered a chopped salad with no chicken and when my salad came... surprise, there was chicken! I informed the waitress and she quickly took it back and I waited about five minutes while watching my friends dig in until my chicken-less salad came back. The funny comment the waitress said was ""I took the bacon out too and saved the day!"" One of our friends mumbled you would have saved the day if you didn't bring the chicken out in the first place. No apology whatsoever.  The food was average and overpriced. The tex mex eggrolls and sweet corm tamale cakes apparently are a hit with a few friends. The buffalo blast which is Chicken, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing, is NOT a winner. It's shredded chicken and then overly battered and fried, which was one hot mess and artery clogger. After two, the guys felt their chest hurting a little from all the grease. My chopped salad could have had more flavor but I wouldn't have paid $11.50 for it.  After our entrees were cleared we ordered coffee and of course cheesecake. Most of us shared with one another but it took more than15 minutes for them to make the cheesecakes from scratch I mean, grab it from the fridge. Splitting the bill was very difficult. Meals were all over the place on different bills. The waitress clearly acknowledged she had put some things on the wrong check. Good thing, our group of friends were understanding and most of us just paid each other back instead of having the waitress fix it... which by the way she didn't even offer.  In conclusion  Cons: -Service is SLOW -Waitress was not tentative -Food is greasy, flavorless, and overpriced Pros: -The cheesecake is still awesome By the time we paid and left it was 11pm... between one hour of waiting and two hours of service or lack of service..

Julie H.,"Gaithersburg, United States",31,144,349,4.0,19/2/2015,"So glad that Cheesecake Factory relocated to Montgomery Mall, its more convenient to go to and always a good place to stop in after some shopping. I find that this restaurant is a lot smaller than the one at White Flint, but there's also an ""outside"" area that allows you to sit out in the mall area. The service here is pretty quick, and the staff are friendly. I've waited some time to write a review even though I went here on opening week and it was awful (but I returned and its back to the same Cheesecake Factory that I know). The first week that I came here, three of us ordered a pasta dish and red velvet cheesecake. Each and every one of your pasta dishes was extremely extremely salty. It was awful. We got it as carry out, so we couldn't really say anything. It was unbearable to eat. The cheesecake was excellent. After a few additional times visiting Cheesecake Factory, and reordering their pasta - its back to normal and not the salty dish that we first got when we went there. My favorite pasta at Cheesecake Factory is their Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. I also enjoy the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. The portion is large enough to make me full and is really sauce and great with their brown bread. Their mac & cheese burger is also yummy, however the burger is overcooked even if its preferred as medium. I enjoy order the claim as an appetizer, it comes with two sauces to dip with. Even if Im not hungry, I still stop by to get a slice of red velvet cheesecake.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=180

Now, not a problem...and I wonder why people are complaining about parking. Really? Maybe around Christmas time you would. Not now. So....what about the food? That should count more, right? Yes indeed, and I'm disappointed. I had Moroccan Chicken with couscous and onion rings. The chicken had no flavor, the couscous had no flavor and the onion rings...Holy shiiiiite! No flavor. Is this on purpose? Real grilled chicken would have some kind of flavor, which makes me think it's some microwaved crap purchased from Target. (Then again, frozen chicken from Target, Giant, etc., usually HAS some flavor!)...and even I know how to add something to couscous. But the onion rings---THAT is unforgivable. Perhaps their chefs should learn from the ones at the Rockville Ale House, because THEY know how to make 'em. $5 for onion rings = BETTER HAVE THE FLAVOR. *sigh* The cappuccinos and the vanilla bean cheesecake were fantastic.

CF is one of those places that is hard to avoid--you end up there in a variety of circumstances.

No, when you succumb to the chain-sit down service restaurants you deprive  yourself of the chance to eat something more interesting.

The saving grace was the wonderful server and the food.  We came in and put our names down for a table for two and were told there was a 40 minute wait. So the a friend and I were waiting and waiting and almost an hour passed, and I started to notice people that came after us were being called. Uh. My friend walked up to the hostesses and asked what was going on, and the one who took the name down said they had the name down wrong (it's Sean, not Shaw -_-) and that we missed our table and they'd called us again. Alright that's their mistake but whatever, so about five minutes later the hostesses (three of them) started screaming ""SHAW! SHAW! Your table is ready!"" So he sighed and just walked up and the hostess he talked to looked like she had never seen him before. And then he goes ""I was just here like five minutes ago, you had my name wrong"" and they all go ""OHHHH no wonder you didn't come forward for your table!"" Okay, I was pissed to the max. Even after someone corrects you you still get it wrong? Someone needs to fix that, or them. I almost walked out. As we're being seated, I notice there's still a bill on the table from the previous diners. Annoying. The server was so sweet and nice I started feeling better and then we actually enjoyed the night. I ordered the Steak Diane and he got Farfalle with Chicken and Garlic and both were delicious! The Steak Diane has this amazing sauce with mushrooms and it's *definitely* drool worthy!! We finished off dinner with a tiramisu and chocolate tuxedo cheesecake which were a perfect night cap. Everything was pretty big in portions too, I ate about half my tiramisu before I gave up because my tummy was just packed haha.

Like a stylized version of a place from the 20's or 30's with low lighting, wood panels, and cool, jazzy music. Mosaic tiles hung on the walls and created a sleek , contemporary feel to the space. The servers also wear crisp white shirts. It makes for a great look. On this trip, I sat at the bar and ordered a turkey and avocado sandwich and a cold apple cider. The sandwich was on the small side and the cidar wasn't ""ice cold"" as advertised but I was OK with that for the most part. The bar is too small but small tables behind it give one more space to sit. The bar does have frosted bar taps for the beer. HUGE ! LOVE THAT !!! It was awesome to see.

Stephanie G.,"Washington, DC, United States",0,9,,1.0,20/2/2012,"I've always loved cheesecake factory and really wanted to eat here for my birthday.  Called in the morning to see if I could do call ahead seating or a reservation, which they don't, I told the hostess on the phone that I was going to have about twenty people and I had told them all to meet there and that we wanted to eat around 7 or 8 and wanted to know what time i should come in since we were probably going to be put on a wait list. She told me to get there around 6pm. At 6pm, when we said a party of 20, they said it would be four hours. I've worked in the food industry my whole life and I've never in my life told someone they would have to wait four hours for a table, that's essentially telling someone to get the hell out and find somewhere else to go (which is fine, because we did).  All I can say is that if you have a large party or are planning a special event, I wouldn't suggest coming here, I felt like my business wasn't wanted.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=320

And Cheesecake is open until 11pm, I believe, so if you go before or after peak hours, you'll be seated right away. Bad: It's pretty loud at times. During peak hours, expect to hear the birthday song at least 5 times.

Su K.,"Washington, DC, United States",229,428,582,2.0,19/5/2008,"For the life of me, I can't understand why there is always a wait here. For one, I've never seen too many shoppers in White Flint Mall at any given time so it's not like the clientle are shoppers looking to grab a bite b/c the food court sucks, which it does. Second, you can literally rub elbows with Rockville's elite (and not so elite). The tables are so closely spaced, you'd think you asked for a table for 30. Some of you may argue that, ""Hey! They have booths you know!"" Fair enough. But you generally have to wait even longer for a booth and the booths are made in such a manner that you can definitely feel the nervous diner behind you tapping their feet as their date takes a turn for the worse. Third, the wait is ridiculous. I'll wait for many things but not 30-50 minutes for $15 pasta and $10 burgers. And if White Flint were a mall you could actually do some shopping in, the buzzers would help. Most times, I find that people receive a buzzer and either go to Border's, but not too far into it in fear of the buzzer going out of range, or just wait in the lobby of the mall or Cheesecake. One reviewer stated they take reservations, but every time I've called they told me that they do not. Seeing how busy it is, I doubt a reservation system would be in their best interest. Food - All gripes aside, the Thai Lettuce Wraps are fantastic, the Cajun Jambalaya is overrated, and if your namesake is a factory of an item, said item better be dang good, and it is! My favorite is the black-raspberry truffle. Mmmmmm!!! The brown bread with the oats on it is sweet and soft while the sourdough is a wee bit too sour for me. Service - How do them mugs manage to work in a restaurant and keep their all-white uniforms completely free of stains? Either they use some stainguard that can cause numerous forms of cancer and should not be used if you are pregnant, expecting to become pregnant, or nursing, or they've become experts at navigating the really tight confines of the Rockville Cheesecake. Location - It's in White Flint Mall. Apparently, people only go here for Cheesecake or Bertucci's if they'd rather wait 15 minutes rather than 50. If you've got 3 hours to kill before whatever it is you were planning on doing in Rockville, if that plan didn't include an hour visit to Border's, I definitely recommend this place for the good food. The food seems to be better here but the wait times seem to be MUCH better at the Columbia Cheesecake.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=320
Andrew S.,"Rockville, United States",0,43,,2.0,22/10/2008,"First of all, I have to say that our waiter was very polite and helpful.  Nothing else good can be said about this trip to the cheesecake factory.  The restaurant was essentially empty yet it took 30 minutes to seat us. Once we were seated the hostess was borderline rude when we asked for different table.  I felt this was a very legitimate request consider one of our party was 8 months pregnant and wanted to sit in a booth and not a chair.  The hostess however, did not. I ordered Fettucini Alfredo, with a few changes, whichthe waiter was helpful with, however I was then informed that they were out of fettucini noodles, which I found slightly odd. The single worst part of the dining experience had to be when the appetizers arrived.  About three waiters arrived, one woman was so rude that it was ridiculous.  She had apparently not thought to pick up the plate of Nachos with a napking and said that it was hot.  We were at a tiny table and were trying to make room for her when she got exasperated, started moving our food around and then threw the plate on the table and walked away. I picked up the plate and held it for about a minute just to prove it wasn't even that hot.  That was the rudest waitress I've ever seen in a restaurant. All in all it was a very bad experience and even though the food was pretty good it just can't eclipse the rudeness of the staff and the overall bad atmosphere of the restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=320

Passion C.,"District Heights, United States",280,192,83,4.0,1/6/2011,"I went to Happy Hour early evening on a Friday (about 4pm) and sat in the bar area. We ended up there after getting seated and the waitress told us that the amazing Happy Hour specials were only available in the bar area. Which kind of sucks (-1/2 star). So we relocated.  The bar was pretty packed already and was filling up pretty quickly. This meant a very busy server.  He worked as efficiently as he could because there were so many people to tend to. But there wasnt much time for any personal attention. But I guess its hard to have amazing service at such a popular restaurant.  The Highlights: $5 Long Islands and Mojitos. I am a bartender and that long island was easily one of the best ones I've ever tasted. My bf had their electric pink lemonade or whatever its called and it was excellent. You couldnt taste an ounce of liquor. And we were both quite a bit past tipsy after only 2 drinks there! Half off appetizers. We had the Calamari. No complaints there. STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE FOR DESSERT! Cant leave here without it. The wait staff was even nice enough to hold it in the refrigerator for us while we shopped. The entrees: I had Pecan Crusted Salmon, absolutely delicious, with some type of shrimp scampi. It was a combination platter. And the shrimp I couldve actually done without (I didnt expect it to be fried -1/2 star). I only ate about 1/3 of my food after getting pretty full off drinks, appetizers, and bread. My bf got the Chicken Madeira and he damn near ate it all. I think that the wonderful thought of having leftovers later that night kept him from finishing it.

Honestly, beyond my problems with the Factory contributing to nationwide obesity, the food is usually pretty good. Ridiculously long menu, but at least there are choices. I settled on the seared tuna salad, which was good but not great. The very popular lettuce wraps were fine as the table seemed to like them. It would be helpful to note on the menu that peanuts are sprinkled over the chicken just in case anyone is allergic (Ahem). We split two slices of cheesecake for the table. The chocolate coconut was a bit too sweet, but the red velvet white chocolate was unamimously praised. The texture of the white chocolate went nicely with the creamy soft cheesecake and decent red velvet layers. Everyone liked their meal, a feat not to be taken lightly considering the tough crowd.

Anyway, a few observations: --Am I the only one who thinks that ""factory"" is just not an appetizing name for an eating establishment? --With a menu this big, I would not expect anything to be that fabulous. --Service was, overall, good.  My three dining compatriots had plenty of requests, and most of them the servers had no problem filling.  --I was, however, chagrined to see our waitress chomping on gum.  Not exactly professional. --The salmon lunch special was a good deal -- more than one person can/should eat (salmon plus 2 sides) for only $12.95. --The salmon was overdone, and too salty.  As other people have mentioned, everything here seems to be oversalted....I was thirsty the rest of the afternoon. --If one lived in a place with few dining options, I could understand the appeal of CF.  But when you're on Rockville Pike, and a short drive from  Bethesda, I just don't get it.  That - however - is not surprising, as there are plenty of things in this life I just don't understand!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=260

For those of you who are complaining and leaving mediocre reviews, it say's a lot about your food judgement.  Cheesecake is a chain restaurant, but it's one of the best chain restaurants in the country. From its huge portions... (who complains about big plates? take it to work the next day) to its big menu which contains food from every direction in the sense that you can be in the mood for any type of food and it will be on that menu. The service is always A+, the waiting list is always long but that has a lot to say about a restaurant that doesnt take reservations and is always, always packed.. I love this place because everyone can agree that they will find something on the menu. Everytime I order something new, it is an adventure. I have never had anything that I did not like. I am the type of person who likes to stick to the same plates because I don't like to walk out unsatisfied but that has never happened at Cheesecake and I hope I dont jinx it because I am trying something new tonight :) The cheesecakes are better than any I have ever tasted, offcourse their specialties are cheesecakes and they do a hell of a good job on them.

The food was luke warm and the salmon tasted dry, but at that point, we were so hungry we didn't care and just told them it was fine because we didn't want to wait any longer.  This was the first time we had been there in about a year, I think I'll just stick to Bertucci's across the hall or PF Changs from now on.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=260
Kat L.,"Great Neck, United States",270,711,238,4.0,19/11/2009,"This particular cheesecake seemed really small.  They are super anal about having your entire party ready to go before youre seated.  Heaven forbid someone use the potty before they sit down.   Our waiter was a bit off, and I think the table was too large for him (there were 5 of us).  But he did bring my basil for my strawberry martini.  Don't knock it until you try it. I don't eat cheesecake, but the consensus at the table was that the slices were the smallest they'd ever seen.  I got a whopping slice of chocolate cake and kept my mouth shut lol. Good ol' cheesecake.  Consistent, and never disappointing.  Although this location is super super dark.

Philip T.,"Washington, DC, United States",70,179,112,3.0,5/12/2010,"If you're familiar with the Cheesecake Factory then you won't find anything surprising or out of the ordinary here. Compared to some newer restaurants, this Cheesecake Factory feels much more intimate, with lower ceilings and cozier booths. The food is also standard fare, good selection of food from a variety of different cuisines though none of the ethnic dishes come even close to being authentic.  During the lunch time when I came, it wasn't too busy so there was no wait. The server was very quick to bring water and bread and was very nice and energetic, though after checking in on us so many times the sheer amount of energy became slightly much.  Nevertheless, the food is good and the service was fast on the day I came. I got the Saigon Grilled Chicken Sandwich which is their version of a Banh Mi which came on a very chewy, thick crusted baguette which was a workout to chew though the flavours were good as was the peanut dipping sauce that came with it. The vegetable pasta my mom got was also good but a little bland. Overall this Cheesecake Factory is your run-of-the-mill CF, no surprises, It is located in White Flint Mall which is convenient, there is also no shortage of parking outside up front or in the garages as part of the mall.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=260
Trevor M.,"Rockville, United States",131,187,487,3.0,31/8/2010,"All the cake without the cheese.  Let me just come out of the closet with this. I love cheesecake. It's my form of dairy laden crack...but, do i get it there? no. However, do I go there for the food and the bar....YES!!! Atmosphere: It's a chain restaurant and it's Cheesecake factory. So, their standards are medium high. It's all the local folks in your neighborhood. Now, let me state this...depending on where you sit, stand, or eat...the acoustics suck. You can't hear your loved one, you can't hear the person you're dumping...you can't hear when you're being dumped...turn down the music or fix the acoustics. Oy vey!! Food: Can we talk about a restaurant that is willing to serve just about any style of food, any ethnic style, and do it moderately well. Now, if you're a food afficiando? If you really know how to cook well...you don't come here to really critic it unless it just...well, sucks. You come here because...it's a watering hole that actually tries to please the heck out of everyone and try to do it with some panache. Hey...no flair...that's panache alone. But, what I like about their food...they are willing to amend it to your unique tastes...you don't like onions...gone. you like your chicken grilled without sauce...done.  Bar/Drinks: Nice basic martinis, good selection of alcohol...but, here's what I like...they have regulars like any other bar in Rockville/N. Bethesda...but, these barflys are local and really nice folks who appreciate the bartenders here and it shows in their interaction.  Service: Hey...it's Cheesecake factory...they're like the Disney of restaurants...all white clothing...which on some folks...not the best idea, but I get the point.  Price: Ya, know what...good, average prices for a good amount of food. There's value in dare done hills. No one is going to get that joke...huh.  Return rate: Oh, yeah...i'm there.  Bottom line.....there's a lot of cheesecake factories in Maryland/VA/DC area. I've been to a lot of them...If I don't go to the Columbia location...i'm here. But why not 4 stars? Hey, they still have to get better and get competitive with the other restaurants in the area or they will become Cheesecake Factory Diner....Hmmmm, now that's an idea...not. So...do you want to know where I get cheesecake from? Read some of my other reviews to find out. Yeah...i'm a tease.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=260
Leslie W.,"Frederick, United States",2,9,,2.0,30/12/2013,"I was embarrassed to have subjected my family to this restaurant.  Food was just okay, service and attention to detail below par. I have eaten several times at the White Flint location with good service and tasty entrees. My family had never been to a CKF and thought that while they were visiting would be a nice treat for lunch. Waiter was friendly/polite but took too long an everything and got the order wrong, so my hub ended up with a poblano pepper instead of the poblano hamburger meal! The other items were okay, nothing to write home about.  The wrong order caused huge delay in getting served.  To make matters worse the bill arrived with the additional cost of the poblano pepper. I would have expected the waiter to have inspected the bill, especially in light of the mistake. For some reason the magnetic strip on our credit card didnt work in their machine (no problem in the Apple store in same mall ) so the waiter had to key in by hand; no problem but this took 45 minutes (ended lunch 1:04p walked out 1:47p). After my hub signed the bill the waiter stated that he needed the card again so an imprint could be made...this all sounds very unusual??? I will be keeping my receipt and monitoring my CC activity.  Did I mention they were not that busy.  So what should have taken an hour to get a simple meal, took almost two hours!!! Hope this was a fluke, but I am not likely to go back for a second try :(",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=260
Sharon W.,"Silver Spring, United States",86,367,,3.0,7/9/2016,"Previously, I rated The Cheesecake Factory based on the D.C. and White Flint locations and only gave it one star. Recently I met friends for lunch in Bethesda at The Cheesecake Factory now located in Montgomery Mall (my friends' choice). The restaurant is easy to locate and has plenty of parking within easy walking distance. There is also valet parking for a nominal fee, and they'll stamp your ticket in the restaurant. The ambiance at this location is much nicer to me than at the previous location. It appears to be larger and the seating seems more spread out. It's still noisy, but 5 of use had no trouble conversing. One of the best parts of the visit was our server, Scott. I can't imagine what he thought when he saw our table of five 50 years+ women. He was great though, and even offered to split our checks without our asking. It was a little hard for me to find something that fit into my diet, but I settled on a small Greek salad. It was decent, but nothing really too special. The crab cake that another guest at our table ordered just looked okay and I noticed she didn't ask to have the leftover boxed to take home.  Since Montgomery Mall is a convenient place to meet friends in the Bethesda area, and we had a pleasant experience at this location, I'd actually suggest it myself as a nice place for lunch.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=40
Shawna M.,"Derwood, United States",35,144,276,1.0,15/7/2016,"Disclaimer-- this review is based only on the service. Typically, I go to Cheesecake Factory for their huge menu that has something for everyone. The food is typically pretty tasty and they have a vast ""skinnylicious"" menu. Always consistent and the honey wheat bread is great.  Today I visited for a lunch around 1:05. Our party of 4 was promptly seated. Javina was our waitress and was pleasant. She took our drink orders shortly after we sat down and then did not bring those drinks for at least 10-15 mins. She then took our order and proceeded to take drinks and the order of another table before inputting our order into the computer. Usually our food comes out quickly and to the proper temperature. Today was no different, but that was after she finally inputted the order. The food arrived to the table at approximately 1:45. So 40 mins for 2 salads and 2 sandwiches. It wasn't the speed in the kitchen, but the speed of the server. The food runner was pleasant and retrieved the bread I requested. After we were served, I asked the waitress for a refill assuming it would take a while to get and I was right. I could see our waitress leisurely talking to staff near the kitchen while I waited for my refill. I honestly would not have minded if she was prompt otherwise. I was so annoyed with the service today I almost asked for another service. So will I return? I will because I'm assuming this is a fluke, but if I get this waitress I would ask to be sat in a different section.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=40

Portions include enough for the very next meal. How can you eat that much food? Portion sizes are just too big but leftovers mean I don't have to cook later.... works for me! I have never had a dish that I didn't enjoy. I have had every meal (brunch, lunch and dinner) and never disappointed. My favorite cheesecake is the red velvet cheesecake. It simply incorporates my two favorite desserts. Red velvet and Cheesecake. Just like heaven on a plate. It's so decadent! I never eat the whole thing, and I mean slice, in one sitting...

The salads we ordered - the Greek, Caesar and chopped were delicious! I also had the rib eye and salmon which were decent. The mashed potatoes were good- nice and whipped. We also ordered tiramisu and regular cheesecake which of course never disappoints.  I've come here for happy hour and it is excellent. Appetizers and some drinks for just $5. My favorite appetizer is the sweet corn tamale cakes.  The burgers and fries are also tasty. The pasta never disappoints and the salads again are Fab!

Brian L.,"Rockville, United States",15,71,59,3.0,19/11/2017,"It had been years since I went to the cheese cake factory. Only things I remembered before going last night were that there is a huge menu, it's a very popular restaurant, and they have great cheesecake. Not much has changed but I was enlightened on the quality of the food and the service. First I went on a Friday night with a party of and no reservation. I was surprised and impressed there was no wait. May have been because we dined at 10:00 pm. The restaurant didn't seem very busy but our waitress was clearly overwhelmed with our party. Slow off the bat and slow at keep drinks refilled. What was frustrating was that there always seemed to be 4 employees standing around not doing anything. At one point there were about 10 empty plates on our table that needed to be removed and a group of employees was literally standing next to our table. Several of them looked at the table and clean up. Later when a food runner dropped off some of main courses I politely asked him to take some of the plates and he had an attitude, he scoffed but he took them. Regarding the food, the crab dip was good. The egg rolls were wack. The bread to start was decent. Rock hard butter but decent bread. My main course was a bacon cheese burger. I think it was called the bacon bacon burger. Asked for it medium rare, it came medium well and was not very good. Five guys is about 10 times better than that burger. Fries were good but not hot. The highlight of the evening was the macadamia nut cheese cake. If it weren't for the cheesecake I would never return. Next time I would literally only order the cheesecake. In conclusion the menu is huge and eclectic but the only thing they've mastered is the cheese cake.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=40

What kind of manager is this? Huh? Who are you? Do you care about our experience? Do you want to make it better?  We won't be returning. Your service is absolutely horrid. Review updated: I just asked for the manager's name. His name is Amos and he needs to return to management training, ASAP. Your waitress (Sabrina)however was really nice, prompt, and attentive. Maybe she should be a manager? Your General Manager Liz, is absolutely wonderful and a breath of fresh air. She literally changed my mind about giving this place another try.

Amanda I.,"Cabin John, United States",21,87,120,4.0,20/2/2016,"Recently I have just been getting desserts here! The service depends on the server, I come pretty late at night so they sometimes rush me. Some servers are really friendly, I had one that was more on the rude side.. My friend always gets coffee and it is always hot, which is obviously good.  I have gotten Linda's fudge cake, this is super moist and served with three dollops of whipped cream. It has a rich chocolate ganache frosting on top and layered in between, I do wish there was more between though. There is a thin layer of the ganache on the backside of the cake too and this part is covered in chocolate chips, which add a nice crunch. I would definitely recommend this cake to someone looking for chocolate cake here. My personal favorite dessert here so far is the Godiva fudge brownie sundae. This comes with 3 triangles of rich fudge like brownie, 2 scoops of ice cream with dollops of whipped cream on top, some fudge sauce and 2 chocolate squares. I love how big this dessert is! I do eat the whole thing by myself (I have a very big sweet tooth!) but it could definitely be shared with 2 or 3 people... probably more but I wouldn't share with more than one lol. I love that the brownie is so dense and fudgy and the vanilla ice cream goes so well with it, I am drooling now.... I got the pumpkin cheesecake. The texture was good and the crust was nice and crisp. There was a big dollop of whipped cream on top and on the plate that went well with the smooth cheesecake. My problem with this was the size, compared to the brownie sundae it is significantly smaller and I didn't feel satisfied after. But this is coming from a sweetaholic. The apple crumble is big topped with ice cream and whipped cream. The crumble part is really good when it mixes with the apple ""goo"" it almost has a cake batter texture and there are also walnuts in there to keep some crunch. However I thought this dessert was a little too sweet, I would not be able to eat half of it because of that.  Let's talk about some savory food! Pasta da vinci is super yum! This is probably my favorite dish here. It is penne pasta tossed in a madeira wine sauce that is super creamy and decadent and it has 2 kinds of mushrooms in the dish as well as chicken. This is a very hearty and comfort food meal that I love! The Chicken stuffed tortillas are also good, however sometimes inconsistent. I have gotten these probably 3 times and once there was barely any chicken in the tortillas and then another time they were more stuffed with chicken. This comes with a corn cake that is very good (we usually ask for extra!) The cake is a little sweet and crisp on the outside from the grill and soft on the inside- these never disappoint! They also come with a tomatillo sauce, which we get more of this too because it adds a ton of flavor. It is a little tart and tangy I would say. The tortillas come with a huge side of black beans. The BBQ ranch chicken salad is not the best salad. It comes with a lot of different things on top, but there wasn't enough of any of them to make the salad make sense. It almost felt like there was too much going on and not enough of any one thing. The toppings are split up into sections. So there was chicken in one section with the BBQ topping. The chicken when I got the salad was dry, so that was disappointing. There was a small amount of tomato, corn and beans in the salad (which I never thought I would use small describing a cheesecake factory dish!) And then on top of everything were these thin cut fried onions, there were a lot of the onions and they were really good, but I wish everything else had more too.  The Chinese chicken salad is pretty good. The dressing is delicious and I like the addition of the mandarin oranges and slivered almonds for some crunch. The salad has way too many of the crisp rice noodles that taste like Styrofoam. Other than the noodles I would say this is one of the better salads here. The tossed greens salad is actually good for being so simple. It is just lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sliced zucchini and sliced beets. You get to choose your dressing and we usually get the skinnylicious balsamic, which has a lot of flavor for being a skinny dressing. I like this simple salad as an accompaniment to an entrée.  The cheese pizza is one star- it tastes like one of those fake cheese pizzas from my childhood. The cheese is cheap tasting. The marinara is ok (we sometimes get charged $2 for an extra small side of marinara and sometimes don't). I would not recommend the cheese pizza here. However, the bbq chicken pizza is on point! This pizza has the right amount of bbq as the sauce and a good amount of cheese and chicken. While it is probably the same cheese they use on the original cheese pizza it must go better with the tangy bbq and chicken. I have gotten this a few times and would get it again! The crust is ok nothing special but it's decent.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=40
Diamond L.,"Chesapeake Beach, United States",0,28,2,2.0,17/10/2017,Just left this location all I wanted was some pumpkin cheesecake.

What's even better is their Tiramisu. No, not the Tiramisu cheesecake, but the actual tiramisu. It's really fantastic. My friend and I had a list going of all the tiramisu we had tried from mom and pop Italian restaurants to frozen ones from grocery stores and surprisingly, Cheesecake Factory topped that list. Lucky us! However, I wish the food was as good as the cheesecake. My friends raved about the bread basket but I just thought it was meh. I was really disappointed with the ""spicy"" Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp. Not only was any black pepper flavor missing from the dish, but it was soooo sweet. Like corn syrup poured on 1 min before serving sweet. If you want to serve that, fine! BUT don't label it ""spicy"" on your menu.

But in all seriousness, my experience here was awesome. They have LOTS of options, and it takes awhile to sift through their menu. Our waiter gave us enough time to do just that without forgetting about us. He came in and checked in on us to refill water and bread whenever we needed and was charismatic too.  Now, let's talk food. I like lists so I'll tell you what we got (in the order of my fav to least fav): - Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo w/ white rice - fanfreakintastic! I will be ordering this for myself next time I'm here - Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya Pasta - good but could use less oil and the addition of sausage - Chicken and Bacon Carbonara (had lots of peas) - Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta (I believe that's what it's called) - needed more sauce I tried a bit of everything (and a bit more of that gumbo). I was looking at that gumbo the way someone looks at their crush. No lie, it's real good.  What I love about the Cheesecake Factory is that the portions are large enough for you to have enough leftovers for another meal. Something to keep in mind when you see the prices.

Wesley Y.,"Rockville, United States",721,325,623,1.0,9/8/2016,"This is a long overdue review from 3 months ago. I came in @ lunch time with 2 of my friends and we all ordered off the lunch menu. (pointed @ the lunch selection items) We came at about 2:30pm which to me is just a late lunch. Apparently to our server its dinner time. She put in the dinner size portion for us. I didn't realize this while we were eating the entree because the portions are huge @ cheesecake factory. I tried to order 3 cheesecakes and use our coupons that we had to redeem free cheesecakes (I purchased $200 in giftcards and got some free  silces of cheesecakes). We waited about 10-15 minutes for the cheesecake. We told the server to pack the cheesecake togo because it was taking too long and my friend had an Uber  waiting outside the restaurant going to the airport.  When the server brought the check and the 3 cheesecakes I saw the check and realized that we were charged for dinner portions. I asked to speak with a Manager and she told me we have to Specifically tell the server we want lunch portions when we come in for lunch. This should definitely be a server's immediate response if they have customers ordering lunch items maybe they should ask do you want the lunch or dinner portion. Just plain ridiculous. After arguing with the  manager over the bill my friend had to leave and couldnt wait anymore. She comes back and tells me that we can only redeem 2 cheesecakes because we have 2 people. After lots of explaining the server didn't even try to help explain to the manager we were a party of 3.  Worst experience I've had @ cheesecake ever. This location is just going down the drain.

Before we dived right into desserts, we did have a proper, ginormous dinner -  mac and cheese burger and pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. For a chain restaurant, I'm very impressed by Cheesecake Factory! The burger/sandwich were well made (plus on quantity, plus on the quality too). The burger patty was juicy, the layer of fried mac and cheese was gooey and crunchy -  I wasn't surprised that my dad devoured the entire burger in one seating. My pulled pork sandwich - perfectly toasted bun, saucy delicious meat on top of meat, topped with their creamy Cole Slaw - forget trying to save room for dessert! And did I mention their sweet potato fries were fried perfectly? One of the best sweet potato fries I've had - straight from the fryer and yet not one bit greasy!  We wrapped our dinner date by sharing the perfect treat - Godiva chocolate cheesecake - 3 combined layers of perfection: brownie cake, chocolate mousse, and Godiva cheesecake.

I know things move fast when we engage the manager as I explained earlier. She looked at us like this was the first time she heard it even though she clearly acknowledged it at 6:12pm and said ""oh sure, I can bring more bread"" with a blank stare. Bread came out around 6:35 with the butter and ketchup.. 23 minutes after our initial request.  Looking around baffled at the service we were getting from her, compared to the 2 tables around us where she was treating them like gods... We were very disappointed. One could consider this discrimination as we were the only non-Caucasian table she was servicing (from what I could see).  Anyways, it was hard to tip when we paid the check. Sadly we gave up 11% because her tip obviously gets split among others. If she was the only one to get a tip, 0% would be a very high tip in my opinion...

Preet M.,"Clarksburg, United States",1158,103,60,4.0,4/9/2014,"Service: This is the only reason I take off a star, and even this is not applicable to all guests. My parents are vegetarians who love Mexican food.  Naturally, the giant ""Burrito Supreme"" called out to them. Only problem was that it had chicken in it. We asked the waitress who was assigned to us the first time we went there whether or not it could be made without chicken. She told us that the chicken inside the burrito could be removed, but the sauce was marinated in a chicken broth. Over the last seven times we have been there as a family, we have received a different answer to the same question every time. Some hosts say that there is no broth used, while others say that we can replace the sauce entirely. For that reason alone, I remove a star. Our most recent waiter, and its a shame that I forgot his name, was absolutely amazing. He was of Asian-american descent and was extremely friendly/ready to help. Food: I personally love every dish I have ordered here. Its nice to see that there is at least one restaurant left that doesn't skimp on quantity. Portions are huge and I highly recommend the factory nachos as an appetizer to share. I also love how there is now a calorie count for each dish. Most of my friends who count calories gawk at the four digit numbers next to many of the dishes. I just sit there like ""I ain't even mad."" All of the cheesecakes are delicious, however I have run into a few instances where they are not available as slices, especially towards the ened of the day.  Environment: It is a dimly lit restaurant with tons of artwork all around...even the ceiling is painted intricately. The restaurant is loud. Bottom line...it always is packed and the great thing is, regardless of how packed it is, I have never had to wait more than 20 minutes to be seated. This may not apply come holiday season, labor day, etc. but still very impressive in my honest opinion.  I would be more than happy to give the restaurant five stars, if someone could just answer once and for all, can the burrito be ordered without any meat whatsoever?

Lakeshia B.,"Silver Spring, United States",365,128,13,4.0,4/7/2012,"I have been going to various Cheesecake Factory restaurants for as long as I can remember, but this one in particular is a staple for myself, family, and friends. I love coming here because my food is usually done right, taste great and my service is nine times out of ten on point. Today my mother and I went to have lunch. We got there just as soon as it was opening and were seated promptly. The staff is friendly and always professional when I have dealt with them. My first order was one of my favorites the strawberry lemonade, but when it was brought to me it tasted terrible. At first I told the waitress and told her not to bother as to not seem rude. But she promptly fixed it and brought me a fresh glass made from a different bottle. I decided to forgo getting more strawberry lemonade and went for the decadent Dulce de Leche milkshake (not for the weight concious) I proceeded to order the Dynamite Shrimp with dipping sauce which I love. My mother ordered another one of our favorites which are the crab bites. I also recommend the buffalo blasts, popcorn shrimp, buffalo wings, dumplings, and my utmost favorite the calamari. We both ordered the shrimp scampi (mine with no tomato extra garlic) and that came out piping hot and with a little kick. This time the kitchen added some hot pepper making it even more tasty. My other favorite meals are the Thai Chicken, Chicken Picatta, Beef ribs (which was removed from the menu), and the Orange chicken. We decided to forgo dessert we were so full by then. I loved the atmosphere it can be a little loud but you can carry on a comfortable conversation if need be. The ambience is always soothing. I love the recessed lighting, comfortable seating, and the luxurious feel with marble trim I recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants to enjoy good food, good service, and a comfortable atmosphere",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=220

My absolute favorite here: AVOCADO SPRING ROLLS.  Mmmm...but I love avocados (I went through a period where I was going through 3 a week...just eating them with a bit of salt and black pepper).  Anyhoo, I do enjoy these things.  I also really like the barbecue chicken salad, but I've begun to make that at home instead of paying $10+ for barely $2 of ingredients.  Their cheesecakes are obviously yummy...I think my favorite for over a decade has been the tiramisu. I'm not absolutely certain, but I don't think they use real cream for their whipped cream - because I tried to put some in my coffee and it didn't dissolve.  Not a fan of not using real ingredients.  Whipped oil is not good eats.

I called the main line and told them I had a curbside pick up order and she asked if I would wait on hold. I waited for five minutes before she came back and took my name. She said it would be a few minutes before my food was out which actually turned into 20.  Then the best part - the person who brought my food to my car told me that my dessert was still being boxed and he would be right back with it.

The strawberry shortcake is a very large biscuit filled with vanilla ice cream and then piled high with strawberries and topped with whipped cream. The shortcake can serve 3 or 4 people if they have eaten their own entrees or even shared them with others.

I have heard that people like to go here because it's a place you can ""take a group of people, and everyone's happy.""

Some annoying factors to acknowledge: 1. Freakily friendly servers.   I'm upbeat by nature, but I've been almost frightened by the level of enthusiasm from CF's waiters -- on issues like whether I know how their tea is sweetened.  It's as if they were trained by Brian at Chotchkie's in ""Office Space""  -- minus the mandatory flare.  Of course I'd prefer over-enthusiasm to the alternative, but really, these people must get hit on their heads with happy sticks before their shifts begin. 2. The portions are also obnoxiously large.  Who am I kidding -- this doesn't bother me.  I can just choose to pig out, share or doggy-bag it. 3. The unbelievably long wait times, and corresponding buzzers.  Again, I thought these were cool as a kid -- until I realized that you have to be about two steps away from the door in order to stay in range.  As others have mentioned, during peak times, just stalk seats near the bar.  If you score one, you can order anything off the menu and avoid the wait. All in all, there's something annoyingly appealing that earns this place its three stars and keeps me coming back every once and awhile.  I mean, I've always liked the food from CF, and compared to NYC restaurants, you definitely get bang for your buck.   Final tip:  Who needs restraint?  For a full American hedonistic experience, save room for some freakin' cheesecake.  You can do it!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=300

The Cheesecake Factory used to be a hip place to eat out in the early 90's... but now it seems its just generic and dated like a cheap Las Vegas hotel buffet. The decor in this particular Cheesecake is campy and very early 90's (think Luxor Hotel in Vegas). Its no longer cool. Now to the food, their chicken salad sandwich on toasted brie was gross. It had too much mayonaise & too much garlic. The chicken itself must have been boiled because it tasted like nothing. Because of this, the overwhelming taste of the garlic buttered brie bread was overbearing almost to the point of it being inedible. It was a HUGE sandwich but quantity did not make up for quality.  Their pepperoni pizza was average, the tex mex wraps were BLAH and lacked flavor although it was filled with black beans, avocado, rice onions and tomatoes. The carlton salad was OK but the ""vinaigrette"" dressing didn't seem to have any vinegar at all, it was rather sweet and oily much like sesame seed oil. The chicken mixed in their carlton salad also seemed to be boiled as it was also flavorless. They might as well have used tofu !

I ate here last night after about a year-long hiatus (from the menu, not the cheesecake).  I was disappointed to see the salad I wanted, the Endive & Blue cheese, is no longer on the menu.  That was all I wanted, an appetizer salad and some cheesecake.  I looked at the other app salad options and remember trying 2 others and not liking either one: the Country French and Fresh Vegetable.  When I had the Country French a few years ago, I sent it back because there were PICKLED BEETS on it.  The menu says fresh beets, which to me are crunchy and raw.  About a year ago I had the Fresh Vegetable and swore I'd never have it again: it was like someone dumped a bag of frozen mixed vegetables on a salad (in fact, the green beans may have still been frozen).  Shouldn't have mattered considering I ordered the salad for the white cheaddar (as stated in the menu), only they didn't have white cheddar, so they put some other cheese on there that had no taste.   So I ended up getting Evelyn's favorite pasta, which I used to really enjoy.  Last time I had it (about a year ago), I found it to be really oily and left my lips slippery...just an unpleasant sensation overall.  But looking over the rest of the menu and remembering other mediocre meals from the past, I decided to stick with the Evelyn's pasta.  Bad choice.  I don't know what happened this time, but it tasted like feet.  Really salty feet.  I haven't had such horrible tasting food in I don't know how long.  I could barely bring myself to eat more than a couple of bites.   I am officially done with this place.  Take-out cheesecake will be the only thing I'll order ever again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=300

Gen C.,"Cleveland, United States",1,33,9,2.0,17/12/2015,"Normally I wouldn't bother writing a review for a place like the Cheesecake Factory (places like this you kind of know what to expect) but our experience was so poor that I feel like I need to warn people about this specific location, because from the looks of other reviews this is kind of the norm. A friend and I came for dinner on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm - wanting to catch up somewhere that reminded us of high school, so where else than the Cheesecake Factory, where we like every other American teenager used to go when we wanted a ""classy"" dining experience. I'm not trying to harp on the CF; it's a good place to go for some American chain restaurant dining, even if you're going there ""ironically"" like my friend and I were. Anyway, our experience: Walked in the and the hostess said hi and just stared at us, I'm not kidding. After a few awkward seconds, I asked for a table for two and she led us. Weird, but whatever. Our server, whose name we never got, didn't even bring us drinks (when we just wanted water) until after he had brought us our bread basket. The sweet brown bread was delicious, but the white bread was rather stale. He then took our orders, and our food was brought out within reasonable time by a different server who set it down and left. My friend ordered macaroni and cheese and was brought the fried macaroni and cheese balls appetizer. I ordered the Skinnylicious lemon garlic shrimp and asked for a side of vegetables instead of the pasta, but was instead brought a bowl of lettuce. As a former server I completely understand mix ups happen, but it was frustrating because if our server himself had brought us the food (instead of shmoozing with the table of girls next to us, which he was doing all night), he could have attended to it right away. When he saw us with our food he came over and right away pointed to my bowl of lettuce and said ""That's not a side of vegetables"" and picked it up to take it back. My friend is very shy and I knew wasn't going to say anything so I went ahead for her and let him know that she wanted mac and cheese, not the fried MC app. His response was ""Well, that's not what you were pointing to on the menu"", which kind of took me back - not how a server should respond. We both just kind of looked at him and he said ""Well, I can put in mac and cheese, but that's going to take a while"", and my friend said the app was fine, but I was pretty put off by that. He brought me back a side of vegetables: a plate of steamed snow peas, carrots, and something else drenched in this asian sauce. Not very good.  The MC balls were good but we were very unhappy with how he handled the whole thing. Also, if you go to CF, don't order off the Skinnylicious menu. I paid 17 dollars for six tiny pieces of shrimp and asparagus. It's not worth it - make CF your cheat meal, don't try to be healthy there. Lesson learned. Dessert was delicious, obviously: my friend and I shared the Cookie Dough Cheesecake and the Godiva Brownie Ice Cream Sundae. Our server brought out both with no utensils (after taking our dirty ones away), so we had to wait.  I would not go to this CF again. It seems like a lot of other people have had poor service here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=140

My experience with the service at this restaurant has been frustrating.  We ordered a cheesecake to go using their curbside pickup service.  I gave them my cellphone number when I placed the order and I called them as soon as I parked in the curbside spot.  I was told that they would be out with my cheesecake shortly, but 20 minutes later we were still waiting in the car.  I called them and was told that someone was on their way...and another 20 minutes went by with no one showing up.  Finally, I went inside to get my cheesecake and was told that someone went out to look for us but they did not see our car so they gave us....what?!?!?  There are only a handful of curbside pickup spots and we were clearly parked in one of them.  And you know what, if you do not see us, the you CALL US.  Don't just give up and leave us hanging.

Top S.,"Alexandria, United States",0,14,,2.0,27/8/2016,Visited this location yesterday with a large party of 15. We had a 1 pm reservation but weren't seated until 2. The hostess could not have been less helpful. I honestly think we would have waited longer had we not continued to inquire. She initially tried to seat us in the bar. When we finally did get seated another employee was literally sitting at the table setting it. We started out with two servers for drink orders but that quickly decreased to one. Disappointing for such a large group. Thankfully the young lady we were left with was pleasant and competent. Unfortunately the group was too large for one server. All of the orders came out at different times and the one vegetarian meal never did get put in. So that person was still eating lunch when everyone else was enjoying desert. This was pretty bad for a Friday afternoon. My advice? Avoid this location it's not worth the traffic or parking hassle. I'm only giving two stars since the food was great.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=140

We decided to share our entrees so that we could try a bit of everything. All of the dishes were satisfying. The Roasted Vegetables and Goat Cheese Pizza was my favorite.

We often get the Buffalo Blasts appetizer, a wonton wrapper filled with cheesy buffalo chicken and deep fried - they are the perfect appetizer. I got my vanilla milkshake too, the best milkshake I have ever had. The factory combo my wife got of Chicken Madeira and Shrimp Scampi was a little pricy at $21 for the amount of food she got, but she still enjoys it.

Of course I love the desserts!  We followed this Cheesecake from its White Flint location. They have more square footage at Montgomery Mall and nice ""indoor outdoor"" seating. The service is strong although sometimes a little slow.  The reason a 3.5-4 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated.

So, I'm looking at the menu and finding that a lot of my favorite treats are a day's worth of calories.  And, I'm a glutton...but not that much of a glutton.   The shrimp and bacon BLT can range up to 2000 calories!  My lord and Aunt Jemima that is a lot!  So being semi conscious of my health, I decided to order the salad with seared rare tuna;  A favorite of mine at other restaurants.  The salad came out with a measly 4 slivers of seared rare tuna.  For 17.50 cheesecake can do MUCH better than that.  I'm sorry.  There was a pile of greens, the tuna, and for some reason, sliced rounds of beefsteak tomatoes.  If I was supposed to make this into a sandwich...

As is the case with the Cheesecake Factory, there was a ton of food and our waitress was happy to box up the leftovers, as well as two pieces of cheesecake (Oreo and s'mores), which we enjoyed the following day. I've noticed a few recurring themes in negative reviews. One is that there is a long wait. Of course there will be a wait, since it's a very popular restaurant! But you will get seated eventually, like I said we came at a very busy time and were seated in about a half hour. The other complaint I see a lot is the price.

I also order beef kabobs, however what I got was not really kabobs. It was blobs of ground beef shaped into kabob shapes which tastes bland and a little undercooked, and dry. Seriously, they were like bad hamburgers, not kabobs. The wraps for the kabobs did taste good though.

Lana L.,"Silver Spring, United States",0,35,,1.0,24/2/2015,"Never will I eat here again!!!!!!!!!!! Customer service is awful and the food is not as good as other Cheesecake Factory locations. I took my office here for lunch to celebrate a birthday, thinking it would be a good experience since they have many different choices available. I regret it because the food was awful and the service was just as bad. With the cost of the food, one would think they would do a better job than they do. It's also so busy here that you really don't get the customer service you deserve because the servers are focusing on getting as many tips as possible by waiting a lot of tables as opposed to refilling your drink or making sure your food is cold, for example. On the other hand, I haven't been in one Cheesecake Factory that isn't busy, but the food and service is much better than this one! To add insult to injury, it's noisy as hell in this one!  I did have the decency to call the General Manager, Liz, and spoke to her about how embarrassing it was for me to suggest this place and then I and my coworkers weren't happy with the quality of the food or the service. She did apologize and offered (in January) to send a gift certificate for just the cost of my meal ($30) and told me it would be in the mail and at my address in a week, but after 6 weeks went by I hadn't received it.  I called to follow up and despite the fact that the hostess told me that she was there, Liz refused to take my call. I even left a message about what happened with my name and number, and she never called me back--that was over 2 weeks ago. WOW! I've been to really great Cheesecake Factory locations (like the one on Wisconsin and the one at Columbia Mall) and this is definitely not the experience I've had, so I'm thinking it's just this location. I think they are riding on the laurels and good reputation of a lot of really fantastic Cheesecake Factories that actually value customer service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=200

Our waitress was really nice and provided excellent service; no idea why Yelp has so many negative reviews on the service when I thought it was fine. The food was large-portioned and tasted fine. It's not like super super amazing, but it's pretty good albeit the price tag that comes along with it.  Also, bring flashlights because that place is dark.

After about 10 minutes a waiter showed up and took our drink orders. We then waited another 10 minutes for our drink orders, and when they were delivered we told the waiter we were ready to order. He told us he would be right back. After giving our orders, he tells us that the bread isn't ready yet, and he will bring some out when it comes out. After about 20 minutes we see other servers carrying bread to tables. We look for our waiter but he seems to have disappeared. We finally see him bringing food to the table behind us whom arrived after us. We flag him down, and he tells us about how they ordered salads and that takes less time. I told him I thought 40 minutes was a long time to wait for a cheeseburgers and salmon. He then brings out the bread and our food. My salmon was overcooked and cold. My husband's burger was also overcooked. My daughter's salmon was perfect. My mother-in-law's burger was not right.

Kelechi N.,"Deerfield Beach, United States",5,2,,1.0,16/7/2017,"I usually love Cheesecake Factory, but this location has to be the WORST. I ordered a Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and a Chicken Chipotle Pasta to go. I made sure I informed the cashier that I have an onion allergy, hence why I ordered the pasta without onions and peppers. The cashier said my order would take 15min. It actually took 30min. When I did get my food, I could see almost immediately that there was an onion in my pasta. I took the food out of the bag and showed the cashier. The cashier called the manager and the manager said no that's not onion, it's cilantro. Then I said no, it's an onion (pointing to the obvious onion in the dish). Manager then proceeds to say no, that's asparagus. I then take the plastic fork from the Cheesecake bag and pick up the onion. The manager asks if I wanted another one. I say no because there is a clear case of cross contamination at this location. If someone says that they are allergic to something, every effort in the kitchen should be made to make sure the food is free from said allergen. The manager gave me my money back stating that the entire purchase would be refunded to my card. The manager leaves and then the cashier hands me another receipt for $8 and some change. I asked what this was for. She says it's for the Cheesecake. I said no, your boss said my ENTIRE purchase would be refunded. Why should there now be a balance that clearly exceeds the original tab of $22.23? They wanted me to pay for the Cheesecake but give my the entire refund? The hell?? Makes no sense. Manager came back and credited me again for the mishap. I will NEVER ago to this location again. I have had wayyy too many problems every time I visit.

Once a week my husband and I have date day. He usually wants to go here. The food is great but it would be nice just once to not be forced to sit in the bar.  We've asked to sit in the dining room. We get there right when they open. But it seems they have a server rotation they will NOT budge from.  He works 6 days a week. It's our one day to have a nice lunch and every time we are sat in the bar.  That being said, the salmon lunch special is great. Juicy salmon cooked to perfection. Hubby likes it with mashed potatoes and carrots.  The meatloaf is a HUGE portion even on the lunch size and is better than my mom makes (sorry momma).  Lately I've been getting the Cobb salad no bacon and cannot finish the lunch size. Last week when I was almost finished I bit into a big chunk of pork (bacon). I cannot eat pig for religious reasons and was very upset that it seemed they caught their mistake and picked most of the bacon out. But not all.  Also ordered a Caesar salad no cheese no chicken to go for my vegetarian daughter yet when I got it home it had chicken and cheese. My fault. I should have checked before I left.  Love their signature tea.  Love the portion sizes and lunch specials but for the love of G-d , just once could we sit in the dining room and have some yummy sour dough bread when we come in at opening? Please and thank you.  Ps the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is divine. The Reese's cheesecake is waaaaaay tooooo sweet. But get some of you may love it.

We asked couple times if they were going to seat us and the very rude hostess kept saying I'll take you to your table shortly then proceeded to seat other parties!  The manager came by and I asked what seems to be the problem. He said your table was given to someone else by mistake. I said well that's all they had to say in the first place instead of rudely dismissing us!  At some point after that we just walked out.

Ebie B.,"Chevy Chase, United States",170,86,2,2.0,16/2/2016,"Cheesecake Factory- where everyone is confused, all the time, always. I honestly think they use the shock value of huge portions to distract you from mediocre food punctuated by the mostly wtf service. But a huge plate of greasy fish is still greasy fish. Most recently I went here to pick up a to-go order on Sunday. Yes it was Valentines Day, but I have never experienced a more chaotic mixture of overwhelmed staff, poor planning and horrible time management, even on New Years Eve. There were many tables open that the staff seemed unaware of and I heard a lot of complaining from patrons about the wait.  So I go to pick up my order. There is a huge line. It is slowly merging with another line. No one seems to know where either of these lines lead. I didn't know if I was waiting in a line to pick up food or get a table. Neither did the people in front of me. Finally a staff member assured me I was in the correct line and that although the line was long, they had 2 registers open so it should be moving quickly. Lies. They DID have both open but only 1 was in use. The other served as a prop for one of the employees to stand in front of, doing nothing. In the entire 17 decades I was in line for, I saw her pick up 1 paper bag, put it in the fridge and then continue to stand there. The same line is for people placing an order as it is for picking one up, which makes no sense. I finally get my food. It ranged from lukewarm and greasy to just plain cold. Some of the fish was almost inedible. $20 wasted. Thanks guys.  The restaurant itself looks very nice. It's kind of small and very cramped inside. Outside there is a nice little roped off area inside the mall with stellar views of the Foot Reflexology place. They have made the best use possible of the space outside, and it really looks quite nice. However I'm not inclined to go back anytime soon.

We were told they were short handed and couldn't seat is out there, but we noticed other people were seated out at the tables and my friend talked to the wait staff until they agreed to put us out there when our time came to be seated. I don't know about the rest of you, but I can't hear myself think straight in that main room where it sounds like everyone is shouting at each other. We ordered the pasta carbonara with chicken and found it to be a little bland, but I added salt and found that it was improved greatly with just that. I gobbled up what I hoped was half of the dish while my friend was displeased and sort of gave up on it. I drank a red sangria with my food and found it to be rather delightful. When it was time to pick a piece of cheesecake, I felt very torn. I adore cheesecake and can never remember which ones I've tried during the few experiences I've had with TCF.

Effie A.,"Silver Spring, United States",86,75,44,1.0,29/6/2016,"I have never felt so disrespected at a restaurant, the way Cheesecake Factory disrespected my family. On June 23rd, I brought my family here to celebrate my dad and youngest brothers birthday. When our server (Brandon J) came by to ask what we wanted to drink, we told him without hesitation. 3 of us ordered Shirley Temples, my mom ordered mango juice (which was pink but we're not going to talk about that) and my dad ordered pineapple juice. When the drinks came out my dad noticed that his pineapple juice was basically ALL ICE. So he called the server back to let him know that he doesn't like ice and would just like a glass of pineapple juice. The server comes back with a shot of pineapple juice in the same glass. (Now bear with me.. because I don't have a picture, I'm going to use numbers to help you get a better idea of this). The glass was about 5-5.5 inches tall, they poured just an inch of pineapple juice in the glass and gave it to my dad who came there to celebrate his birthday. That's literally 2, maybe 2.5 sips from the straw and it's finished.  When my dad called the server out on it, the server said ""you didn't want ice so we strained it"". WHAT?! We were shocked! We couldn't believe he wanted us to pay full price for a shot of pineapple juice. So the server then gets his manager (Amos), who said the same exact thing the server said ""we strained the pineapple juice because you didn't want ice"". We felt so insulted. Common sense is clearly not so common at that restaurant. After letting him know that it was absolutely disrespectful, the manager told my dad he would get him a full glass of pineapple juice. Which was what should have happened in the first place. When our check came, they had charged us for 2 glasses of pineapple juice instead of 1. So we had to call them out on that too. We left feeling like they were playing a prank on us. I'm not sure I'll be back there again. I'm definitely not spending my hard earned money on them.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=100
Emily H.,"Escondido, United States",0,6,,1.0,23/6/2016,"My boyfriend, Andrew, and I went to Cheesecake factory this past weekend thinking it would be a positive experience, like every other time we had gone. Andrew is the manager of a sales team, and as a team dinner we decided to all head over to the restaurant. We had a party of about 15. Everything about dinner was great, the food and the service were wonderful, or so we thought. When the check came around, it was about $77 for the whole meal. Including a $14 tip for the waitress, the total came out to about $91. We put $70 in cash into the check holder along with a debit card to cover the remaining balance of about $21.  I thought that this was common knowledge, seeing as how I have worked in my fair share of restaurants, that when both cash and a card are put into the check holder it means to use the cash first and then put the remaining balance onto the card- but if the waitress had any questions about this we would certainly be more than happy to clarify that for her. She had no questions and brought us back the receipt. Andrew did not realize that she had charged him the ENTIRE $91 onto his card AND also taken the cash. That is the problem.  If she would have charged the card for the whole thing and given our cash back, things would be just peachy but she did not.  Andrew did not notice that he was charged for the whole thing until yesterday (Wednesday 6/22). He called the store and the general manager, Liz, told us that he signed a legal binding document agreeing to be charged $91. That is fine. But give us back our cash. To this she responded, ""Well we have no way of proving that there was any cash taken by the server. We will call and ask her and its basically her word against yours"". That is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, we should have been paying a bit more attention at the time and noticed then, but the nature of the  response we have received and lack of any customer service what so ever is appalling to me. I do not see how it is difficult to check the logs which, I would assume must be kept when each drawer is counted out each night and see if that particular drawer was over $70. She has not even given us the courtesy of checking back to that day and seeing if there was any mysterious extra cash anywhere in the restaurant. And if that drawer was not over at all, maybe you have the bigger issue of a waitress that is stealing from the customers. Liz has basically told us ""sorry, but your stupidity lost you $70 to us"". She claims that she called the waitress that rang up our bill, but the waitress has not called back. I'm sorry but that is not my problem. We brought at least $500 in service that night with our entire sales team, and after that experience and how the general manager and the staff of this Cheesecake Factory have been handling this, I will never bring my business back there again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda?start=100

Then I politely pointed out that the next available slice of pumpkin pecan was missing the pecan portion in the center, and I didn't want to get served that piece. Saul snapped at me....and said ""what"". Then said ""ya ill take a look at it"".  He pulled the tray out and muttered ""not a big deal"", but clearly a huge chunk was missing like from a previous serving spatula grabbing it. He grabbed a tissue and plucked the piece off the tray and plated it and put it in the cooler! Some other poor sap was going to get ripped off!   Then he proceeded to grab the next slice and throw it in a container....literally, dropped it from about 8"" above the counter.  I consider myself a CCF connoisseur, so i KNOW that he shouldn't have even been packing the cheesecake. There are dessert staff behind the counter that tray and top the slices and the server usually packs them in the to go bag.

He used a brown paper bag, which cant hold 4 slices well, i shouldve known that, but it didnt dawn on me. I saw no silverware and asked ""can i get some silverware"". Saul replied.... ""whatcha want?""  Then grabbed forks without me responding and said ""forks good"" and threw them on top of the bag.  At that point, I just left. What a terrible experience.

We waited about 15 minutes and then we were walked to our seat.... then the waitress had us walk all the way back to the waiting area because the table was not cleaned up yet -_- We then waited another 5 minutes and then we were finally seated. I was craving their Tuna Salad, but they were completely out.... how disappointing -_- I was surprised that they were out of the tuna at 7pm, but I ended up ordering Skinnylicious Soft Tacos with Shrimp (480 calories). I love how their menu includes the calories for each menu item, it is great for those who want to be conscious of their caloric intake... especially since Cheesecake Factory is known for their hugeeee, often unhealthy, portions. I enjoyed the tacos, nothing amazing, but still good. At $15 it was pricey in my opinion. It comes with avocado, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and shrimp served on soft corn tortilla shells. The avocados were fresh and the shrimp were perfectly cooked. The entree also comes with a Escabeche Salad, pretty much pickled veggies. The salad was average, kind of too sour for my taste, but I did like that it was different from your typical salad.  The waitress was nice and our food came out in a timely manner. The only hiccup of the night was the seating situation... not the end of the world, just a nuisance. There are multiple parking lots, parking should not be an issue.

We have been coming to this location ever since it moved from the White Flint Mall location.  Last night, we came here around 9:30pm, the restaurant was not busy and seemed like they had ample servers still working. We were seated immediately, and our server took our drink order. However, he did not ask us if we wanted any bread, and never brought out any of the bread. After waiting for 20 minutes (he had already taken our orders at this point), I asked him to bring us out some bread, and he finally did but the bread was cold! Bread here has always been warm, at least luke warm, but last night, the bread was just cold. Our order also took around 20-25 minutes to arrive even though the restaurant was NOT busy. Not sure what the deal was there, but we have never had to wait that long even during busy hours. Then, we order a slice of cake and we definitely noticed a decrease in size. I am not sure if this is something that the corporate has changed recently but we were incredibly surprised. It seemed that they were trying to fill the plate with whipped cream instead.  I have been a cheesecake factory regular probably since 2012, but last night was definitely one of the least pleasant dining experience.

Instead of getting his usual, my dad ordered the  Chicken Riesling, which consisted of tender chicken breast sautéed with mushrooms, bacon, onions, and garlic in a slightly creamy white wine riesling sauce.

Anyway, we had to wait 30 minutes, which was kind of a blower because I was in four-inch heels, needed a seat, and the one seat in the small waiting area was occupied. But the time went by faster than expected, especially considering the place was PACKED. (It's much smaller than I expected, too.) I found the hosts to be less than friendly. They were stale-faced and did not apologize when they messed up our table ticket. But our server, Nick, was fantastic. He was fast, polite, genuine, and got all of our orders right without even writing them down! That is a skill only seasoned servers can master.  The bread was not ready for about 15 minutes and when it came out, it wasn't that good. I've definitely had better bread. The entrees came out in record time. I was baffled. I ordered the Shrimp Bistro Pasta and it was phenomenal. Naturally, it was drowning in butter. But the flavors were on point and done tastefully. The only thing I didn't like was that the shrimp were breaded. I feel that is unnecessary. The breading on my shrimp was unevenly cooked (partly burnt, partly soggy, not yummy), but if I removed the breading altogether, the bare shrimp were cooked well and tasted better with the pasta. As a side note, if you're watching your weight, just don't come here. They have a ''skinny'' menu, but why? You're surrounded by cheesecake! You will be tempted. Plus, there's no way I would pay $18 for a salad. For dessert, we were very naughty and ordered a slice of cheesecake EACH. We didn't expect the slices to be that big or that amazing, but they were. The Fresh Strawberry is their most popular flavor and I loved it. It's basic cheesecake with a strawberry topping and it's done right. The Salted Caramel tasted just like you would expect true salted caramel to taste like. The Godiva one had big chunks of real Godiva chocolate - holy smokes. The best one by far was the Oreo. Everyone was blown away.  We took half of everything home in boxes because that's how big the portions are. The menu seems to be expensive, but the huge portions make up for it. We also ordered an extra entree and cheesecake to go and our bill was under $150. Not bad for four, essentially five people.  I will definitely be back here. My first visit was a 10/10. Thanks for making my graduation lunch so great!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda
Penny C.,"North Bethesda, United States",2,36,,1.0,13/1/2018,"We ordered carry out for the first time and were really disappointed with the quality and portion sizes. I was quite upset to see such small portions when we normally get much larger portions when we dine in. They use huge containers but barely put anything in them. Also, nothing tasted good. It all tasted like cafeteria food. I am so, so disappointed with all the food we had. We would have better off eating at the eatery in the mall.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda
Joy B.,"Rockville, United States",170,338,3386,4.0,19/2/2017,"Light, creamy, rich, and dreamy; that is the way I like my cheesecake. No one does it better than the Cheesecake Factory. My latest trip to the restaurant included trying a lighter and healthier Cheesecake ( hahaha).  No really, the base was made out of ladyfingers and it had a raspberry drizzle, with hints of lemon in the cake. The dessert was light and refreshing. It was 700 calories and I split it with a friend, so only a mere 350 calories. That could have been a bagel in the morning or a breakfast muffin, but soooo much more satisfying.    I also have to mention the portabella,avocado,and zucchini fries. They were insanely good. Fried to a crisp, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, each bite was a happy dance in my mouth. It is my new must have dish at Cheesecake Factory. Yes, it is that good!!    The service is always spectacular!  I love the warm brown bread and butter that starts every meal. My go to main dish is the Asian lettuce wrap. The grilled chicken and fresh veggies topped with my favorite peanut sauce is phenomenal!    So whether you are in the mood for a delicious dessert or just want some great food, head on over to Cheesecake Factory and be prepared to be delighted!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda

To my surprise, the service was almost garbage quality. Our glasses of water never got refilled once but the table right beside us got refilled three times the duration we stayed. The salad had rotting pieces of vegetables on it. Could have made us sick. The parts that weren't rotten looked like they weren't even washed. Salmon was okay. Steak was actually very delicious.

Rita W.,"Rockville, United States",527,337,1553,2.0,27/11/2016,"Jeez, what's with the service here? It took over 40 minutes for us to get our check for a mediocre meal. I have a soft spot for Cheesecake Factory because I love the interior and some of their drinks, cake, and apps, but c'mon!! The times I've been to this location have been ridiculous that I wonder why I come back more often than it makes sense. We've tried several things here, apps including -  Avocado Egg Rolls - one of our favorite apps here. A nice crunch, plenty of dipping sauce, filled with avocado goodness.  Firecracker Salmon - totally not worth over the $12. The plating was horrible. It seems that it would have been pretty plating, but by the time it came to our table, it was all on one side that I tried to rearrange it for a picture. The salmon was overly dry, and the stuff was just falling apart.  Wings - nothing special. Some had good amount of meat in them, but overall was dry.  Samosas - again, dry. Dry, dry, dry. We've gotten these lunch items and main entree items -  Sandwich/soup combo - sandwich was alright, regardless of which one you choose - half a turkey sandwich or chicken-almond salad sandwich, with a soup. The sandwiches were pretty good, but the soup was SOOO SALTY!!! I couldn't taste anything else, but the salt. Yuck. The pot of soup is premade, so tough luck there.  Lunch salads - these are alright. Can't go totally wrong with some greens, dressing, toppings, meat. If I were more of a salad person, I'd get these more often.  Fish n Chips - sometimes these are good, but other times they aren't. Sometimes the fish comes out sooooo good, but other times the breading comes falling off, or it's mostly breading and not mostly fish, and the fries come bland.  Burgers - good burgers, but not rememberable burgers.  Kids items -  Chicken - my kids love chicken tenders, but these were just the worst. Chewy, dry, no flavor.  We didn't any refills on our beverages - coffee, water, etc. :(  On the plus side, nothing we ordered was raw or undercooked, ha.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda

Dan F.,"Potomac, United States",0,2,,1.0,9/1/2018,This restaurant is disorganized and incompetent.  I picked up 2 salads to go and when I get home I realized that 1 of them was missing the chicken. So I called to ask for a refund for one of the salads. I was told only a manager could process a refund and put on hold for 10 minutes. A manager never came to pick up so the woman at the desk promised me that she would take care of it. Not surprisingly  I checked my credit card online and I was never refunded the money. So I called back again and was put on hold for another 10 minutes to talk to a manager. This manager told me that since the incident happened several days ago she was unable to process the refund for me.  Needless to say I would not advise carrying out from this location.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda

Mack K.,"Chevy Chase, United States",65,4,,2.0,29/9/2017,"Outrageously expensive, considering the poor in-store takeout service and the quality of food.  A $78 meal for two via carryout last night = no plasticware or napkins (when asked by phone, we said yes) + 10+ minutes waiting for the $8 Oreo milkshake (after paying and receiving the food, which turned cold).  That aside, the food quality was below average at best and cold when I got home due to the 10-minute wait for the milkshake. I live 2 miles from the store. (Perhaps the long wait on the milkshake was due to the server guy getting lost on his way to the bar???).  Until Cheesecake makes up for this, I absolutely cannot and will not recommend this location to anyone. Save your money.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda

Cam C.,"Washington, DC, United States",68,74,275,4.0,21/5/2017,"I usually visit this location to get a to-go order, usually after I shop in the mall or after going to the movie theater that's upstairs.  For the most part, the service at the front counter is alright. CF is often a busy place, and there have been a couple times the staff has been forgetful.  They forgot my fries one time, but luckily I checked inside my bag before I left.  They quickly brought them out when I brought it to their attention, but the staff did not even apologize or act like they cared about neglecting an entire side item in my order.  Another time they almost forgot an entire order of nachos.  They've also forgotten to include bread and butter when I asked for it (more of a minor issue than a missing appetizer or side order, but still a sign they need to slow down).  I will continue to order to-go food, but I suggest you take a peek in your bag before running out of the restaurant. I recently experienced CF's happy hour for the first time.  I must say I am very pleased!  HH is M-F from 4p-6p.  I was shocked at how large the portions were for HH, and the selection of food and drink items is abundant.  Pretty much all of the food was $5.95.  My friend and I shared a couple of the appetizers (Spinach Dip and Tex-Mex Egg Rolls) and we ordered some drinks (Wine and a Long Island Iced Tea).  I will be back for happy hour without a doubt. I can certainly say this location has good integrity.  My friend forgot her debit card at the restaurant one day.  My friend called the restaurant and a staff member informed her that it was locked in a safe.  She picked up her debit card later that week with no issues. Overall, this is a decent place.  I will be taking advantage of their HH more often for sure!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-bethesda
Edidiong A.,"Hyattsville, United States",2,1,,2.0,5/8/2014,"I went to this CF location with some girlfriends looking forward to having lunch and just relaxing with friends. When we walked in we were greeted by a young woman who was also a waitress, she sat us down and never came back to us again. It was really awkward though because we were seated by the cash register which is also close to the kitchen. The waiters were all standing looking like they needed something to do. In the mean time we had no bread or water. When a waitress finally came over about 20-30 mins had already passed. She looked like she was already busy taking care of other people. There was A family that came in after us and got waited on before us. Smh. When the waitress finally came over with water she took our drink orders which took forever before we got that. I flagged down a waiter And asked him to get his manager, he asked what he could do for us and we told him to just cancel our order. He seemed a bit worried and promised to try his best to make our experience better. But we were already fed up. We got up to leave when a manager came and asked us if everything was Ok? We said no, told her what happened and she couldn't think of anyway to salvage the situation, she just walked away.

I had been eating fruit all day & my stomach was growling by 5. So when the waitress showed us to our table, I growled really loud: ""I want a strawberry lemonade please!"" My boy. laughing his ass off at me, had to calm me down & tell me that she wasnt the person who would be taking our food order. So, when our server did come, I already knew what I wanted because my greedy ass had looked the menu up online before I left work, lolo!! I ordered: crab wontons for appetizers, main course: barbeque salmon, steamed broccoli, smashed potatoes & onion strings. My boy ordered a kobe beef hamburger & fries. Forgot what his appetizer was. But here's the thing, he & I were so engrossed in our conversation, that I hadnt noticed that my food was taking extra long to come. Turns out, as the manager came over to tell me, that they had overcooked my salmon. And, for my wait, I could get a free dessert! I choose carrot cake. I didnt know it would be 3 layers!

Given its well known name, I normally wouldn't bother to write a review, but one of their menu items has given me cause to Yelp. The almighty Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake is by far one of the best desserts I have ever experienced. Layers of Red Velvet cake between layers of cheesecake? Can life be any more decadent? I usually come here just to get a slice to go and whenever I bring it home, my family descends upon it in wonder as if it's a holy relic. One of the most fabulous desserts EVER and a great reward or comfort after a hard day. That aside, I've enjoyed all Cheesecake Factory restaurants and this one is no exception. As one Yelper mentioned, the lighting is extremely dim here, but it also depends on where you sit. I had a window table and I was perfectly fine. My ace in the hole entree is the BBQ Chicken Salad.

I must admit, I was on a hot date so I may be a bit generous on my review as I was already having a blast anyway, CF or no CF. Anyway, our server was very attentive and immediately gave us the complete spiel on the daily specials and soups. My mind was already set though- I wanted the cajun seafood pasta- my favorite. And it was amazing; huge portions and great breadsticks too. I topped it off with cranberry juice and original cheesecake while my date had the most delicious pumpkin cheesecake I've ever tasted in my life. Yes!!!!!

We were seated in the furthest of corners at Cheesecake last night. Way in the back. It was quite the hike to get back to the bathroom near the front doors (I exaggerate but you get the picture). Took a while for anything to get to the table. My beer took about 30 minutes to arrive. That's after a manager finally spotted us. Likewise, our meals, extra bread, refills, all took a while. As noted earlier I had a bit to drink. Which prompted me to blurt out ""dude you suck"" as our waiter walked away when he finally checked up on us. I swear he didn't hear, but my companions insist that he probably did. Service was much better after that. Food was decent. The expansive menu always takes a lot longer to browse through. The Spicy Crispy Chicken sandwich (Buffalo style) was not as good as I though it would be. The Thai Lettuce wraps were good. My BBQ burger was ok.  The 30-year Anniversary cheesecake was ok, but very sweet. I very much liked the crunchy chocolate that coats the outside of the cheesecake. The new Banana Cream cheesecake was enjoyable.

It was pretty late, 9:30 pm after movies, we figured it should be OK. We were partly right. We were seated right away, but then  the real waiting started...  We ordered nothing fancy, salad, pasta and side dish. An hour later, my pasta finally arrived.Judging by its sad aspect, it had been seating on the counter for at least half hour. The pasta was dry, the chicken overcooked. The side dish never came, but by then I was so fed up I did not want to wait a minute longer. I complained to the store manager and to his credit he offered us free dessert to make amends. Nice gesture, but I would rather have fresh food timely served than free dessert.  One intriguing fact of the Cheesecake Factory menu. The menu does not show the price for cocktails and beers. My guess is that this is a strategy to maximize profits from sales of alcohol. I asked the waiter who gave me a lame excuse (""we operate in many states which have different taxes on alcohol, so we need to print a single menu without prices....""). Really does not stand up to reason: food and wine are also taxed differently in every state but every bottle of wine and every food item in the menu has a price. What do you think?

The food was just okay, I ordered a turkey burger and it came with a salad and not much of salad at that. Just leaves in olive oil. I didn't even order the cheesecake, which is what I came for because quite frankly, I was tired of waiting and already spend $70 on drinks and food just for myself and pitching in something for the birthday girl.
