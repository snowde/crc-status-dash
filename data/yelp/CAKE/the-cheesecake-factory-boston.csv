Tony C.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,2,4.0,12/31/2017,Arrived at Boston last night and this is the only restaurant at 11:30 pm. Great service from the staff but the food were not as hot as we expected. Boston was freezing and the food were just warm. We ordered a burger and omelette with fries. The burger was tasty beef and the omelette was well fried with ham inside. Two dishes were well enough for two. Later we took away a chesscake and back to hotel for breakfast. We took it in the next morning and it still tasted good. Just one point to improve not hot enough for the food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston
Ellen Y.,"Boston, MA",192,183,39,1.0,1/1/2018,"I'm genuinely upset. Cheesecake Factory is always a slow but good time, but I usually walk out feeling okay! Today was such a different story. We should have known the moment we walked in the back entrance! There were no signs indicating that we were at the back, and we had to awkwardly walk through the whole restaurant for the front.  We got there around 5:30, and was told 25 min for a table of 6. We were seated around 6:10, after I checked in with the hostess how long the wait would be. Our waiter took about 5 min to come to us the first time, and he seemed REAL flustered. My friend asked what the soup of the day was, and he looked at her blank faced saying that he ""doesn't normally work Monday's so he doesn't know and will check"". Every time he left our table, it took him FOREVER to come back. We could not get his attention!! The food was mediocre this time. My friend asked for a medium mushroom burger, but parts of it was DEFINITELY rare. The seasoning on the mashed potatoes was off, but the honey truffle chicken was good. I got the Evelyn's pasta, which was eh. It was a good mix of vegetables, but it all ended up tasting the same. The menu said it came with rigatoni pasta, but I definitely got a few elbows in there. My friend got the shrimp angel hair pasta, which she said just tasted not special. Overall, the extensive menu at cheesecake is overwhelming, but I don't think there's a terrible option.  THIS IS WHEN IT GETS SO MUCH WORSE. We literally waited 45 min between finishing eating to leaving the restaurant. Our server was just too busy. Every time we asked for something, it would take him over 10 min to come back and ask us to repeat what we just said. We even told him in the beginning that we had somewhere to be, but he did not seem to get that. Dinner should not take 2.5 hours when we just got an entree!  We were actually fuming when we walked out. Sat in silence in the Uber back home. Do not recommend this location!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston
Rebecca A.,"Biddeford, ME",61,53,130,5.0,12/10/2017,"I love coming here! The atmosphere, service and of course the food is always fantastic. Oh and you can't forget about the CHEESECAKE!!  On this visit we decided to order from the lunch sized options which are supposed to be smaller but truly you get an amazing portion. I had the spaghetti and meatballs that was very delicious and Judy got the pepperoni and sausage pizza with a salad. She had honey mustard for her dressing and it was the best honey mustard I've had, definitely homemade. The pizza was amazing, so much flavor. For dessert you guessed it cheesecake!! Judy had the celebration cheesecake which was spectacular and I had the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake, decadent!! Great as always!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston
Shalaka J.,"San Jose, CA",43,53,13,4.0,1/11/2018,Good food as always! Had the chicken taquitas and mushrooms. Finished up with the lovely cheesecake with strawberries and fresh cream. Took my sister here she enjoyed am glad. Special mention of the bread they give. Try the brown one (may be it is a rye bread) put some butter on top and have it. It is gorgeous!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston

Fion W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",62,1,3,5.0,1/3/2018,"It's really tasty. Both of dessert and main course. We ordered chicken farfalla and strawberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake texture is creamy, and the strawberry are juicy. And the chicken farfalla is fantastic use fry chicken breast but not dry, and the pasta is chewy. All the seasoning is alright! Strongly recommended!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston
Hillary V.,"Lewiston, ME",23,69,136,4.0,7/30/2017,The menu is incredible. I could probably eat here for years and still never explore the entire menu. It makes for an interesting opportunity to try a lot of new things. We have visited twice in the past month and had a great experience both times. Our waiters went above and beyond both times.  We were lucky enough to experience the soup of the day being Loaded Baked Potato and it was amazing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston

Ilana Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,35,26,4.0,12/3/2017,"We waited around 20 minutes for a seat, which isn't bad. The place was full around 5 pm, which is pretty early for a Saturday night. When we got to our seats, the silverware was dirty so we asked for a new set. Our waiter didn't come to our table often, and we had to wait a while to get our drinks, bread, and for him to take our order. Definitely could've had better service. Other than that, this is your usual Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge and has so many options! We shared a small plate of greek salad, spinach dip, and loaded tater tots. They were all delicious and the portions are huge even for appetizers. For the main dishes, we got a bacon-bacon burger and eggplant parm. We had a lot to take home as well! For dessert we shared a carrot cake cheesecake which was so yummy!!! Definitely recommend if you're shopping in the Prudential Center and looking for a place that hits the spot!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston
Jacqueline S.,"Menlo Park, CA",84,53,27,2.0,9/24/2017,"Wait time was quick. I had a party of five and we were seated within five minutes for dinner. However we were placed at a table meant for four. It was a booth and they stuck a small armless chair at the end. Not the worst. But it took 45 minutes to be given a fifth place setting and when I finally got one the fork, spoon and plate were dirty with bits of greens still stuck on them. Super gross and I got attitude when I asked for another set. You could see the food on it. It also took over an hour for food. On top of that it was annoying to constantly move my chair out of the way for passing people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston
Melanie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",172,286,1175,4.0,4/11/2017,"I love this Cheesecake Factory. Nestled in the heart of Boston it's perfect for almost any occasion. The restaurant is huge and can accommodate large parties. On Sunday's when the entire city of Boston ventures out for brunch and most places require a blood sample and a minimum of at least an hour wait... you can be seated within 15 minutes at the factory.  The menu here is vast... but there is something to accommodate every taste. Fish, chicken, beef, turkey or vegetarian. My favorites are signature the avocado egg rolls and the fire cracker Salmon. These are appetizers but I usually get them as a meal and they are perfectly filling.  The price point is reasonable. Entrees typically don't go past 20.00 dollars here. Of course you can't end dinner at the factory with the cheesecake! Get the cheesecake and damn your diet! It's so very worth it. If you are looking for a good quality bite with lots of options in Boston this is a great option. You can work off the cheesecake with a walk through the prudential afterwards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston
Margot D.,"Boston, MA",220,689,34,1.0,9/10/2017,"If only they had their act together..... I was given the task of picking up dessert for 6 people, so I decided that 6 different desserts would be better than just one, this avoiding the ""oh no, I don't like xx"".  I went in, went straight to the area on the left for take-out orders and waited.  Waited some more, waited more, noticed that there were now 5 people behind me also waiting (and worried that they would think the slow service is because I was picking up something that was causing this) and we were all just watching while one employee took his time cleaning a coffee machine. Not once did he think to say to the gathered crowd ""someone will be right over"".  Nope, just glanced at all of us and kept doing what he was doing. Three (3!!!) other CF employees were at the host stand behind us and did nothing.  It's fine if their position is to be at the host stand and not handle orders, but SAY SOMETHING and then GO GET SOMEONE.  I finally decided I would not be forking over $35-40 for this and left (FYI, Flour bakery is around the corner on Belvidere).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston
Matt L.,"Manhattan, NY",110,420,338,4.0,8/23/2017,"3.5 stars, rounded up. IF you want to get to this Cheesecake Factory (CF), you should exit at the E line of the green at prudential, takes you right out to where CF is in the mall. This CF honestly has a great location, so you probably won't miss it. Ever since I came to America, I've been a huge fan of the Cheesecake factory, primarily because they serve almost everything possibly imaginable here. The second reason I love this place in general is because of the crazy high calorie dishes they serve here. Some dishes here regularly make the ""Dishes with the Highest Number of Calories by Chain Restaurant"" lists: for instance, the chicken and garlic farfalle (according to the menu) has 2190 calories in just one serving. It's amazing, and only appropriate for special occasions.  This particular CF is not much different from other locations. The waitstaff is fine, and generally friendly, and if i recall correctly, the food comes out blazingly fast. I will say however that it is a little bit too dimly lit here, and wish that they would improve the lighting if possible. However, if you need to scratch your CF itch, this is definitely a great option. ?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston

Brooke R.,"Minneapolis, MN",96,90,26,5.0,9/8/2017,"Cheesecake Factory chains are pretty standard, one of the reasons they're so popular is because it's reliable.

Thu N.,"Boston, MA",74,268,895,3.0,1/22/2017,"So just got back to this place twice recently bc a generous family member gave us a gift card. Both time we had not so good service. First time we came right before closing time, around 11:30 pm so I dont really want to blame the bad experience on anyone but us. But you should avoid going this time if you can. The waiter didnt give us bread, which I figured due to the closing of the bakery. However, he didnt mention or apologize about it. The main course was so so. For dessert, we asked for cheesecake and was informed that they were no whipped cream since they are closed. I said it's fine but somehow we ended up with whipped cream anyway. I discussed with my hubby to bring the cake home since I dont want to make the staff wait for us any longer. So when my husband told the waiter to just box the cake and get the check, he said he already ordered it to go (???) Again, It's midnight, I dont blame him but yeah this isnt the best time to visit. Not once our water was refilled. 2nd visit, we came on a Sat and waited for 40 + min. I never knew they can get so busy. I got the cabonara and it isnt one really. I'm not an Italian food expert but I know cabonara's sauce is made with cheese and eggs, but it was with cream. I was so white and wet that it's more like a alfredo sauce. It was still delicious but thats just misbranding. And again, no water was refilled. The waitress this time was nice though. On the plus side, the cheesecakes was delicious both time. The chocolate mousse (recommended by our first water) was a chocolate bomb, so yummy. The chocolate hazelnut crunch was so good as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston
Erika L.,"Boston, MA",278,114,97,2.0,5/15/2017,"Be prepared to wait an eternity! Do not come here if you are the HANGRY type! My boyfriend and I decided to go to the cheesecake factory on the basis that we simply did not know what to eat. The cheesecake factory was the perfect place to go to since their menu has pretty much everything and anything you could think of from italian, Asian fusion, mexican, etc.  Our total wait time for a table was 20 min. When we sat down the waitress wanted us to order within 5 min, but of course we needed longer to peruse the lengthy menu. It took her 15 minutes to come back to take the order.  I ordered the cauliflower steak, since it had less than 1500 calories unlike most things on the menu. My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips with a side of Mac and cheese.  Another 15 passes and the waitress tells me they're out of cauliflower. She tries to suggest something to me but I ask for the menu again. Another 10 passes and I decide on the Americana cheeseburger.  The kitchen was extremely backed up. Although it was mother's day, I would expect the kitchen to keep up with the tables, considering the establishment is HUGE and always crowded when I pass by. For some reason, the orders of everyone in the section came out at different times. The table to my right had gotten there after us but we watched them FINISH their meal and dessert before we even got ours. The table to the left of us ordered before us and didn't get their food until 15 minutes after we got ours.  The cheesecake factory was completely unorganized. What we wanted to be a quick meal turned out to be a 2.5 hour ordeal!  The best food item we had was the side of Mac and cheese. My burger was completely falling apart once I got it. The patty was dry and charred.  Bottom line: do not come here unless you need time to kill and are looking for a guilty meal",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston
Alison K.,"Boston, MA",111,49,48,3.0,7/13/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is a classic favorite; however, the waits are obscenely long. My friends and I waited about an hour for a table, which is typical. We were seated and proceeded to order our food. Two dishes came out on time, but one dish took an additional hour. Although the staff was apologetic, it became known that the dish wasn't on our table because no one had checked to see if the order was actually submitted (it was not). Either way, it's definitely a typical Cheesecake Factory, an American favorite. I'd recommend the chicken tostada salad and literally any appetizers with buffalo in them. For dessert, I'd recommend the fresh strawberry cheesecake or any of the peanut butter cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston
Kurt K.,"Houston, TX",4,111,4,4.0,10/13/2017,We came here at the peak of lunchtime. Amazingly we had to wait just 5 minutes. After we have been seated the waiter came around quickly to take first our orders to drink. He gave us another minute to choose for the eating and we had not to wait longer than this. After we placed our orders we got the appetizers quite quickly. Very tasty and also nicely arranged. Good one. Talking about waiting time. After we had the drinks and the appetizers we started to wait. Longer than usual It was just about to take off a star when the main course arrived. And they were as we expected.

I had the spicy chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries followed by the new addition to their cheesecake menu - an amazing hazelnut chocolate cheesecake!!

Adriana K.,"Cambridge, MA",1,41,53,2.0,7/17/2017,"I love Cheesecake factory and have been to it many times in Cambridge, Chicago etc  But this unit has a very poor customer service!!!  We arrived 9:50PM Sunday maybe staff was tired but if it's says it's open until 11PM I expect the same service as any other time.  We were seated shortly but the waitress never brought our bread until I have asked after like 15 minutes.  We ordered and after another 15-20 minutes the manager came to say they ran out of that dish and tried to make it (chicken with pan gravy) but he sauce didn't work. Well, if the sauce is a pan gravy I really don't know how it can be ran out or not work. But the worst part is to wait again for another dish and the waitress did not even apologize for that. And every time we asked something that was missing (the bread, the plate, the ketchup) she just made an annoyed face to us when we finally could see her (because she was never around).  And to complete, while we were still eating she wanted to take the plate out ""can I leave the fries and take this out?"". Well, no, can't you see there is still food, that I'm holding my fork, eating after so much time waiting for a simple steak?!  Oh, and the New York style steak with ""veggies"" were only those miserable pieces of green beans. At least they changed my mashed potatoes for sweet fries.

Wendy W.,"Houston, TX",501,257,476,4.0,8/3/2017,"I feel like you can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. An American chain that serves EVERYTHING and when I mean EVERYTHING - just browse the menu! It is overwhelming, but they definitely have something you're looking for.   Attire is anything from nice to casual. It really doesn't matter what you wear. It may look fancy-ish, but it's low key. Good for groups, couples, families. Indoor and outdoor seating. The portions ARE HUGE! Remember that! Go at a peek time and there is going to be a wait, however this restaurant is very large so turn around. Note that you could be waiting an hour during peek ours. Try to go just before prime times.  Free bread before your meal, the brown bread is my favorite. You can always ask for more and they are happy to bring it. I have never had a bad meal there, so no complaints. After dinner you may be too full for cheesecake, but definitely browse their trillions of options and you can always get it to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=20

Benjamin M.,"Albany, NY",11,360,3,3.0,4/3/2017,"I came here with my wife while attending a convention. We had been walking all day or sitting in uncomfortable chairs, and looked for a place to eat with guaranteed seating. The CF was packed and they advised that we had a 30 minute wait, but they gave us a beeper and let us wander the mall. Exactly 30 minutes later, we were seated at our table.  I had never been to a CF before and the menu was extensive. However, I didn't want something really heavy as I had a lot more walking to do. I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich, and my wife had their burger. Both meals came quickly. My chicken was fried perfectly with ample lettuce and tomato and I was 1/2 through it when I realized there was either no Buffalo sauce or it was so scantly applied as to be missing. They brought me more and that was nice. My wife enjoyed her burger. We split a piece of lime cheesecake, which was very flavorful and tart and not too sweet. The atmosphere was loud, dimly lit (it got darker as the meal went on, as if they turned the lights down), and very compressed. Since it is at a mall, perhaps it is like this every Saturday for dinner.

I ordered a spinach dip, quesadilla, BBQ chicken pizza, and a slice of cheesecake. The spinach dip lacked cheese and was overall just very plain. The quesadilla was on the soggy side and although we ordered the ""plain"" quesadilla (aka the one without chicken) there was only cheese inside and on the side was some salsa, sour cream and guac (though the guac was quite good and tasted fresh). The BBQ chicken pizza was good since BBQ on pizza is such a great combination....but otherwise the cheese was not very stringy/cheesy, and it was just a plain pizza. Their cheesecake was quite good, we ordered their 30th anniversary cake and it was layers of cheesecake and chocolate cake; although it was very sweet, it was quite satisfying. Their menu is quite extensive so perhaps I can try out their other dishes.....but I kinda don't have the urge to.  Service wise, our server was kind but he never came back to check up on us, and he never bothered to refill our drinks. We tried to wave him down several times but he never looked.

A friend (let's call her H) and I came in to share a slice for dessert, we somehow managed to wander the entire shopping area before finding this place! We clearly weren't that hungry. So H decides that I can be her bf for the day bc only couples share dessert, but everyone in the bar area was sharing dessert so no shame there! There wasn't much of a wait for the lounge at 8pm on a Wednesday night, and we were in and out in no time. Service was quick and attentive. Take a chance and try a flavor you've never had before! I'd personally only come for the dessert, but their regular entree portions are huge so come hungry!  PS. If you're not in a hurry, grab your slice to go and eat in the garden of the shopping area.

First time eating there with my girls I got the Diane steak which was burnt and one side was just burnt black pepper. Another time I had ordered the hibachi steak the waiter took it away saying it's not my order and gave me a steak that's a credit card size. I never met a waiter like that.

She didn't say anything to us or the lady. Hmmm... Eventually we got to the table but...that was annoying.  Waiter was friendly and helpful, but just sort of..disappeared after we got our food. After we were done eating, we were searching for him so we could get the check.  Food was good, all in all.

Stephanie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",204,225,143,3.0,2/20/2016,"Oh, The Cheesecake Factory. Every time I have gone up against you I have lost, crawling back to the car with my tail between my legs and preparing for the imminent food coma. Your modest (but delicious!) assortment of vegetarian options like those rich, buttery, palpably artery-clogging garlic noodles with perfectly cut pieces of asparagus I dream about. Your stuffed mushroom appetizer that my boyfriend and I have a hard time splitting evenly (even with 6!) Not to mention those crunchy, oil soaked portobello, zucchini and avocado fries with assorted dipping sauces that taste so right. (I mean, it's full of veggies so it's good for you right?) All in all, a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory. We came for an early dinner once around 5pm (the ""blue-haired"" special!) and was seated as soon as the hostess was back to lead us to the table. Another day (Valentine's Day, actually) we came back around 9:30 and the quoted wait was over an hour! Since California Pizza Kitchen stopped taking orders ahead of its earlier 10pm closing time, we decided to go with takeout which easily fell within the 15-20 minute estimated wait. Although I could never hate the Cheesecake Factory when it consistently and reliably indulges my most gluttonous fantasies, my boyfriend did see a small mouse in the bathroom as we were getting ready to leave.

Victoria O.,"Methuen, MA",114,2,1,1.0,6/23/2017,"Well, first off every person in my party currently works in a restaurant and is aware of how a restaurant works. We walked in within an hour of closing time, which I understand sometimes can be annoying. However, we waited about 5 minutes for our sever Sarah to come over who was clearly under the influence of dugs or alcohol. Everything was fine until my boyfriend ordered his second drunk which had 0 alcohol and was filled with juice. He told her he didn't want it because there was no alcohol and she laughed and snatched it back. Food came out about 30 minutes later. My food had clearly been sitting in the window for a decent amount of time and had a clear fluid all over the top, my boyfriend ordered medium rare steak that came out med-well/well with broccoli that was freshly out of the freezer and ice cold. Sever did not come back, let someone else know about the food, he took it back, server came back in the meantime, asked how it was over the rail.. ripped my plate out of my hands and didn't let us finish what we were saying. The Manger Denise came over... the most unprofessional, inside and out manger I have EVER come across, didn't offer any apology, or anything. My food came back, the sever handed me my new plate over the rail, didn't offer me cheese, about 10 minutes later my boyfriends steak came back... same exact  steak with the same bite he took out of it.. now extra well done when it was supposed to be med rare and microwaved the broccoli . He found Denise and she argued with him for about 5 minutes telling him that it's normal procedure to heat up already eaten food and put it back on the grill to warm it up(why would you warm up a med well steak that was supposed to be med rare) still didn't apologize, said she was correct several times and that he was wrong. In this time another manger Sam came over. She was the nicest person we came across the entire night, and made sure we were as happy as we could be,and actually apologized for her co workers. About 15 minutes later the new steak got delivered Denise who threw it on the table and walked away.  Not once did Any one except Sam apologize. This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had and all we got out of it was a free piece of steak. So next time you think about going to the cheese cake factory, just remember your food is being cooked on the same grill as half eaten steak, as Denise reassured us SEVERAL times.

Pros: + 15-20 minute wait even with a large line + Super large portions Cons: - Sub par service (primarily due to such large restaurant)  Ambiance (5 stars): The restaurant looks really clean, and modern.  It has high ceilings and comfortable chairs. The washrooms are clean and spacious.   Food: (4.5 stars) Knowing their large portions we only got the main meal. I got a Burrito (4 stars) - super large and tasty. Smokehouse Burgers  (5 stars) - After recommendation from the waiter we got 2 of these instead of the Bacon Bacon Burger.  The burger was amazing.  One of the best burgers I ever had.   Real juicy with a generous portion of bacon and cheese and great sauce.  Would def recommend it.   A Salad with Salmon (5 stars) - All the ingredients were really fresh and they went well together.   Service: ( 3 stars) We order drinks at the start and then we ordered food.  We were given bread at the start, and most of the drinks about 5 minutes later.   We finished the bread, and still waited another 5 minutes for the drink (After reminding the waiter that the drink was missing he came back with it).

The food doesn't really need to be reviewed.  I got the carbonara pasta which was yummy.  The only thing I wanted to mention was that we had an interesting interaction with our server.  He seemed to be making a federal case about not being able to split a check but trying to reassure me that it could be done at the end when payment was made.  I used to wait tables and I like to think of myself as being a very gracious and considerate guest.  I only asked because I know in most places there is a policy against splitting a check if you don't mention it upfront as you order.  I would expect a lecture if I had not asked ahead of time but I was not expecting the tongue lashing when I mentioned it early while ordering.  Okay, so just say that it can be taken care of at the end and it would have been fine dude.

Nicole Y.,"San Diego, CA",10,111,103,5.0,11/5/2016,"I give the Cheesecake Factory 5 stars because every time I've been it's been smooth based on food and service. Their menu is 27 pages I believe and their Cheesecake selection is quite large. Their portions are large and if you plan on counting calories they now have a skinny-licious (I think that's what it's called) menu. But the calories in all the meals are pretty high. Definitely a casual night out if you're hungry and want food with lots of options. It's inside the prudential center so if you wanna take a walk around the mall while you wait to be seated there's that. But you should be prepared to wait if you come here for dinner. There's always a huge wait. It's not super long but if they give you a little buzzer then you can't go far because it won't register when they try to tell you your table is ready. Also, if you wanted to just come here for dessert that's a great option. You can just get Cheesecake at the front they have a little table. Oh!

The drinks and avocado egg rolls came soon enough and were tasty, but the good stopped there.  The Kobe beef burger I ordered medium rare took 30 minutes to come out and was cooked through, charred, dry, and crumbly. The waitress asked if we wanted a new one (yes) and sent the manager over to apologize. Another 20 minutes later I asked the waitress to please check on the burger and she brought one 10 minutes later-pink but dry inside, room temperature, cut in half, and charred on the outside with a grease soaked bun. It was like the kitchen cooked it, checked the color inside, plated it to sit, and heated it up on a hot grill when the waitress came to finally bring it to us. The burger fell apart and was not edible.  The waitress offered to bring something else but after an hour and a half we just wanted to leave.

Cheesecake was not busy and we had to wait about 10 mins for them to put a table together which I thought was surprising when I walked in and saw all the empty tables. Our waiter, Paco, was good, he was able to remember who ordered ice water, water with no ice, and lemon with water. He was patient when we told him to come back so we could have more time to decide what to order. I ordered the California avocado lunch salad without onions. The salad was recommended by the waiter. I ordered the salad with dressing on the side because Americans love to slather their salads with dressing which I don't like. My dish was presented nicely and there was a cup of dressing on the side. However as I started to eat my salad, I noticed that the dressing was mixed in. I was disappointed but decided to eat super-dressed salad. If you're going for salads, I highly recommend sweetgreen over salads from cheesecake. After we finished eating, we ordered 2 desserts to share: 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake and the strawberry shortcake. Never ever ever order the strawberry shortcake. The cake was dry and tasted really old. The ice cream and strawberries weren't able to recover the dish on their own. I'm not a huge fan of cheesecakes, but the cheesecake was 10x better than the shortcake. We only ordered the shortcake because the person we wee congratulating isn't a fan of cheesecake.

Paige T.,"Boston, MA",0,16,5,1.0,9/2/2017,"Absolutely do not come here. Unless you want to be taken advantage of and robbed. Hadn't been to the cheese cake factory in almost 2 years, & was beyond excited to come here. Fail. My boy friend, & I were seated and it took about 20 mins for someone to come over to us. When I saw and heard our waitresses slurred speech it all made sense. (SHE WAS ON DRUGS) At that moment my boy friend said ""should we just leave now"" but me being Hangry at this point figured the food would be out in no time although we still hadn't received our drinks or bread for table. I then grabbed a bus boy who was cleaning the table next to us and politely asked him to find our waitress since now it had been a half our since we were seated and the only thing on our tables were menus. The waitress came back over and pointed at me and repeated my drink out loud like she had forgotten them disappeared for another 20 mins. Now almost one hour prior to arrival I finally got up and found a manager whose name was (RYAN) I told him what was going on and he already knew who my waitress was and described her to the T. He then said that she had numerous complaints and her behavior had progressively gotten worse through out the night. I told him we were just going to leave and he pleaded and begged for me to stay saying he would take care of the check and was very sorry for what was happening. I went back to the table and they brought out our bread, one app, and on entree at the same time. I said to the food runner isn't the whole point of appetizers so it comes out prior to your meal, & with the other apps we ordered? Not one and one?! I was beyond frustrated at this point and asked the food runner to take the entree back and bring out our other app. We ordered buffalo blasts with ranch on the side and Mac and cheese balls. The buffalo blasts came out right away but there was no ranch so we waited and waited and waited for about 15 mins until the buffalo blasts were ice cold so we didn't eat them. We only ate the Mac and cheese balls. The manager told showed us who was supposed to be taken care of us for the rest of the night the only time he checked on me was when he asked if I wanted to comp the entree since it had been sitting in the kitchen and was now cold.. I told him well I would hope they would make and send me out a new entree since it's not my fault our waitress was busy getting high in the bathroom.. then was very confused because the manager had just begged me to stay saying he would comp the bill. Our new waiter disappears and my self and boy friend are just awkwardly sitting there with empty drinks thinking sooo are we all set then since he said it was taken care of and no one has come over to us for 30 mins. So we got up and walked over to the cheese cake counter to take desert home since we didn't touch anything but our one app we knew we would be hungry later the SO CALLED MANAGER chases us over causing a scene saying we were DINNING AND DASHING! I was mortified and began to cry I couldn't believe this and him causing a scene did he not remember the conversation we just had!? Probably not because it was a long dreadful 21/2 hour of painful waiting later. He claimed he said he would only comp one thing off the bill and not entire bill although we only touched one plate... he didn't take anything off the bill and charged us 70$ in full for food and a miserable experience.  I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN.

Taryn S.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",1,31,,5.0,2/15/2017,"My favorite restaurant is The Cheesecake Factory. I like The Cheesecake Factory        because of the food. I also like how it looks. My last reason is the dessert.                     I think the food is very delicious. There is lots of food on the menu but I like the grilled cheese because it is not over cooked. I also like fries with my grilled cheese. I think the fries are the best because they aren't too hot or too cold. There is pizza and lots more. The waiters also give you free bread with butter when you sit down. They give you any kind of bread you ask for if they have it. I like the plain bread. That is why I love the food at The Cheesecake Factory.   Another reason why I love The Cheesecake Factory is because of how it looks. There are benches with a rectangular table across. But if you want there are chairs with pillows on them around a circular table. When you are done and waiting for your check there are couches to sit on. I think The Cheesecake Factory looks awesome. It looks like a very cool restaurant. The one I go to is in a mall, on the bottom floor of the Prudential.  Finally we get to the delicious dessert. Its called The Cheesecake Factory for a reason because the restaurant makes cheesecake! Also if it is your birthday you can have cheesecake and an ice cream sundae. There is LOTS of kinds of cheesecake. Some flavors are plain, oreo, and strawberry cheesecake but, there is WAY more!!The dessert is SO yummy, you should probably go and get some! Those are 3 of the reasons why I love The Cheesecake Factory. The 3 reasons I wrote are only some reasons. There are more reasons why I love The Cheesecake Factory too. You could go there and see if you agree with the things I wrote!  - Written by William, a student in Ms. Taryn's class",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=40

The floor is super slippery!!! I almost felt off my boots walking in there. Don't they ever clean it??  There are various types of food offered but I just feel like none of them is really good. There are American, Italian, Chinese, Thai, even Vietnamese food...and it sucks. I had fish and chips and garlic cheese bread. The fish is so bland. It has no taste at all I can't remember how much salt I had to put on. The garlic bread would be better without cheese cause it got too greasy. I did have a ""fresh"" strawberry cheesecake which was fine but Im not really a fan of cheesecake after all so... The price sucks compared to the quality of food also.

The Cheesecake Factory is a great place and also well-known, the service is slow, the menu too big, but great quality and pretty pricey. This time however, the service was the best service I've ever had at a Cheesecake.  The place was pretty busy, it was a Saturday around 6pm. We didn't make a reservation, which got me hesitant to go there because usually the wait is about 30mins -1 hour without a reservation and at least 10-20 with one. They say us down immediately, gave us our appetizer within 10 minutes of ordering it. The cooks really do have to be appreciated here. They did a fantastic job. Although the waiter didn't come around as often as I would have liked, especially not have my drink refilled, was slightly annoying, but everything was fast. The appetizer was interrupted by our entree of Steak Diane (slightly salty, but great meat and mashed potatoes!). Although mine was over the medium-cooked amount I asked, it was still great and made for even better leftovers. For dessert, my boyfriend and I split a cookie-dough slice of cheesecake. It wasn't very good, and I usually love love love cookie-dough. The piece of cheesecake seemed frozen and hard to chew and that was two hours later as we had gotten it to go because we were too stuffed to eat any more. From previous visits, the strawberries is whipped cream is way underrated and the banana cheesecake is the best!

Vicky H.,"Boston, MA",353,459,1340,1.0,1/17/2013,"It has been a few months since I came here so my friend and I decided to come back to eat. I am on a more strict diet so there are things I wouldn't be able to eat. The menu is huge -- more like a book so it does take a while get through it and check out what you want.  The place, usually around dinner time is very busy with long waits. We didn't wait long, probably about 7 minutes or so. Could have been worse, i suppose. We waited over 30 minutes once and still had to wait another minute or 2 even after our buzzer lit up.  After we placed our drink order, it took awhile to get to us - it was only water. I don't know why it took so long. Maybe they took a while to cut the lemon and lime? The bread came out and they were out of wheat so all we got were white bread which my friend and I both really care for. The waiter apologized and could get us a fresh batch but there might be a few minute wait because they were out of it. We were ok with that.  We didn't order an appetizer but just went straight for our entrees. My friend order her usual and I ordered the Grilled Salmon. It came with Broccoli and Mashed potatoes. I can't eat potatoes so opted for another green side - asparagus.  The bread finally came and we were both starving. That was good. I chose not to put butter and it was still good. (Usually i smother it with butter... mmmm).  Our entrees took a little while. The broccoli looked like they were previously frozen florets. When you bite into it, it wasn't exactly like fresh ones either -- taste just like previously frozen florets. There was no flavor to it, no crispiness, just very limpy. The asparagus was a little bit over looked and limpy as well. I do have to say, the Salmon was done just right. It was a good size piece and was not over cooked. I am however, disappointed in the 6 pieces of asparagus.  We waited for the water to be refilled but that never came. When it did, we were pretty much done with our meals.  Finally, after much wait, the check came. I was in shock they charge an extra $1 for asparagus. I asked the waiter about it. He said the computer automatically charged me it because I substituted a different side. When did this happen??? There was nothing written on the menu that they'd charge you extra for sides. What if you can't eat certain foods?? So obsurb and never heard of. He apologized for it but didn't offer to talk to a manager... so we opted to give less than our usual generous 20% tip because clearly he didn't deserve it.  We didn't get dessert either because neither of us were happy with the service and didn't want to stay longer than we had to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=120
Isabella C.,"San Francisco, CA",294,170,407,4.0,9/18/2014,"4 stars for the cheesecake, 3 stars for the food. Let's be real. I don't think we go to the Cheesecake Factory for the food.  They do have a nice range of options on the menu but I find that nothing tends to stand out very much. I've had most of their pastas and usually they're quite bland. They do have different sauces and taste accordingly, but generally there are no spices or special flavors used to accentuate the natural taste of the vegetables/meats in the dish. The one appetizer I've had that really stands out is the Buffalo Blasts. They're fried balls of Buffalo chicken bits and cheese and they taste heavenly though they're also extremely greasy... My favorite salad is the Luau salad and not surprisingly, it errs on the unhealthier side of salads.  I would definitely recommend sharing main courses and appetizers per table instead of each ordering a main because the serving sizes are very generous. It's important to make sure to save room for cheesecake at the end! And on that note, I'll just say that I think the best part about the Cheesecake Factory is the range of choice you get with cheesecakes. I've made it a personal goal to never repeat a flavor and to be honest, they're all amazing in their own way. The texture of the cheesecake tends to be fairly consistent regardless of flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=120

Ariana P.,"Brighton, MA",0,5,,1.0,1/8/2017,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for a reunion dinner. While planning, we called ahead and asked for a reservation. The first time we called, we were told that they did not take reservations. The second time another member called, someone allowed a reservation for us at 4:30.  When we arrived, we were told there was no reservation under our name so we had to get a pager and wait 30 minutes and that was fine. The part that was the most appalling part was when a waitress (not even a hostess) called out the name of our party's name. She kept calling so we went up. She looked at us, we said the party's name and then she looked at us with a disapproving look and said ""Is your pager buzzing?"" When we responded no, she said ""Nice try."" Um, since when did we need to prove our identity? She continued to call the party's name but no one stepped up. So they moved on to another table. We waited another 20 minutes before we knew that we had been waiting way over a half hour. So my party went up and asked about the reservation as well as when we would be seated. They conveniently said that we were next. When we were lead to our table, we were seated at a booth meant for four with a chair at the end. No other booth had that kind of arrangement. It looked like the table had been put together in a rush and last minute. My party was positive that the table being called earlier was ours.  The rest of our experience was okay. The service from our waiter was okay, but there could definitely be room for improvement. I would like to think that the waiter was new and was trying to still get the hang of things. The food was as expected.  I am very put off by the way the staff talked to us, as if we were trying to take someone else's place in line. No one else was coming forward and the name they had been calling was one of my party members. We genuinely thought that she was calling our party. I felt that it was very unnecessary for the hostess to talk to us that way. We were polite the entire time as well as treated the staff with respect. I am not sure that person should be in an industry that involves being nice to customers. What I noticed the biggest problem about this location is the staff. The host/hostess stand seemed very unorganized, the waitstaff seemed to be less than thrilled to be there. It's understandable, not many people want to WANT to work in the industry, but if you're going to at least try and hide how much you hate to be there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=100

Emimi S.,"Boston, MA",3,46,23,3.0,9/25/2015,"I came in at around 3pm today, and to my surprise, there was actually a decent amount of people eating. Lot of people were having late lunches, or early dinners , I guess. I was here for what seemed to be lunch #2.  Anyhow, I'll just say that right off the bat, that the service we received was pretty terrible. Our waitress was slow, wasn't very friendly, never asked about water refills, or checked up on how we're doing. -1 star for that. As you may all know, this place offers A TON of food. After 15 minutes of looking at the menu, we managed to narrow our order down to: Crab Artichoke Dip, Shepard's Pie, Grilled Salmon, and Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake. Crab Artichoke Dip- served with thin, crispy slices of buttery bread. The dip itself was pretty good; it was thick and creamy, and reminded me of chowder. The only complaint I had was that there wasn't much crab in the dip. Maybe it was blended in or something, but I was expecting chunks of crab meat. Not really worth the $11.50. Sherpard's Pie- This was my first time trying sherpard's pie, but I thought it was tasty! Has meat, peas, mushrooms, carrots covered in a rich sauce and topped with a mound of mashed potatoes. Meat was flavorful and not dry , and the portion was pretty generous, so would give this dish 5 stars. Grilled Salmon- Fish itself was pretty standard, maybe a little above average. But then again, I've never really had a grilled salmon that made me go 'MMMMmm, OH SO DELICIOUS!!!!' It's served with side of tartar sauce and steamed, seasonless broccoli. 3 stars Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake- caramel+pecan layer, followed by cheesecake layer+ chocolate brownie layer. The chocolate thing on top was super good. That's some solid chocolate right there. But the cheesecake itself was ok. Good, but not something I would want to order again. 3 stars Love the menu offerings. Love the portions. Kinda love some of the food. Hate the service. And the prices. There are so many places to eat in that area. I would advise that if you have the time, explore somewhere new, fun, and cool to try!

Ian C.,"Irvine, CA",0,45,18,2.0,5/21/2017,"My wife and I have been to a good number of  Cheesecake Factory locations throughout different parts of the US because the food is consistently good and we know what we will get.  This location was no different.  However the waitress Fransheska was probably the least attentive one we've ever had in any C.F.  first she was hardly ever available the entire time we were there.  Only took orders and delivered our drinks one time.  She got the order wrong.  Never checked back once, not even once.  No refilling empty water glasses.  Not asking if we wanted more bread.  Never checked to see if the food was fine.  We had to ask her coworker who was able to correct the error in one minute because we could not see or find her.  Entree took about 40 min to show.  Maybe kitchen issues but never once updated us.  We just sat there with empty bread basket and empty water glasses and kept ourselves entertained thankfully to smartphones.   Never once had a unprofessional waitress in any C.F. and this was first",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=100

On a Sunday morning St Patrick's Day weekend, we looked for a place to have a late breakfast. We were surprised that The Cheesecake Factory offered breakfast every Sunday.  I ordered pancakes, eggs and bacon, my partner had eggs, bacon, hash-browns and toast and or friend had french toast and bacon. The servings were large. The eggs were fluffy as well as the pancakes. The bacon was crispy the way I like it. The french-toast was moist with a slight crunch on the edges and the hash-browns were nicely seasoned. We all had orange juice that tasted freshly squeezed.  What was nice is that each dish was plentiful and the cost was reasonable as compared to a mediocre yet expensive breakfast at the Sheraton.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=100

Eric S.,"Boston, MA",20,286,26,4.0,1/4/2016,"For a chain restaurant, this place never disappoints!  The waitstaff can sometimes be hit or miss, but the food is always stellar.  Some of my favorites include the Ahi Tartare (an appetizer dish consisting of a puck of chopped raw ahi tuna sitting on top of a puck of avocado, sitting in a pool of soy ginger sauce, topped with spicy mayo, pickled ginger, and sesame seeds, garnished with fried wonton chips.  It's a delightful Asian twist to a French dish (or a French twist to a Japanese dish, you decide!). Normally I opt for ordering two or three appetizers instead of an entree.  Another decent ""appetizer"" that's actually entree sized are the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  They're not authentic by any means, but they are DELICIOUS!  It's simple.  All you do is make a taco/burrito with fresh lettuce as the shell.  It comes with pickled carrots, noodles, chicken in a peanut sauce, parsley, cucumbers, and bean sprouts.  It also comes with three sauces.  I'm not quite sure what's in them, but they're all good! As for entrees, the sandwiches are very good, and the burgers are very good as well.  The burgers are actually quite large, and come with decent sized patties and generous portions of condiments such as lettuce, tomato, and onion.  Plus, they're cooked to order! After stuffing and/or gorging yourself on this delicious food, you might want to take your leftovers to go, then go home to hibernate, but what's this?  The waiter/waitress just brought you a dessert menu!  Oh no! You're stuffed!  But somehow you still have room for dessert!  Why would you come here if you're not going to have a slice of their namesake!  I usually either opt for the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake, or the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake.  I've tried the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and have found it to be lacking a bit in the vanilla department.  The Hot Fudge Sundae is good too, but only order it if you intend on picking up a slice of cheesecake at the to-go counter up front! Yes, the price is a bit steep for some of the menu items, but if you want to take someone out to dinner, this is a spot that will never fail you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=100

Yuka Y.,"Brookline, MA",413,322,1048,3.0,7/1/2013,"It saddens me that the only ""decent"" place college kids seem to be aware of in Boston is the Cheesecake Factory. CF is always the default #1 idea when it comes to brainstorming a place to eat for a fairly large group. There's more to Boston you know!!!  As a foodie, I secretly die a little inside every time CF is chosen. I'll let the exchange students wanting to visit CF reason slide, but with the rest of my American friends, there's no reason to visit this place more than once a year. I don't have a thing against chains, it just baffles me when a lot of people don't want to venture beyond CF for a nice dining experience. If I'm in charge of deciding where to eat, CF will not exist in my list. Yes, CF has food that doesn't disappoint, but I wouldn't say it's outstanding. Portions are large and for the most part overpriced. Menu offerings lean towards Italian and Mexican cuisine. I thought it was brilliant when a friend ordered off of the appetizers list because of the smaller yet filling portions. Their skinnylicious side menu is an annoyance. In an ideal world if one dines out, one should enjoy food wholeheartedly without having to give a #(*k about calorie count.  Recent visits, I've had their White Chicken Chili and Kobe Burger. The Chicken Chili is on the hot end similar to that of salsa. It's like a spicy tomato chicken soup with rice. Kobe Burger was decent, done medium rare as requested. Pricing was obvious it wasn't real Japanese Kobe beef, but their pseduo Kobe beef tasted decent. It'd be  foolish to use real Wagyu Kobe beef as burger patties anyways!  Their cheesecake is on the heavy, sweet end. If you're looking for a slightly lighter, not overly sweet cheesecake, go for their Wild Blueberry White Chocolate or their Vanilla Bean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=100

She was so nice and reasonable, despite the restaurant being so hectic! Our wait was not very long, she personally saw us to the two tables 6/4 and after seeing 10 of us try squeeze into a six top booth, our waitress who's name I have regrettably forgotten asked us if we wanted to move to a much larger open table in a section of the restaurant that had previously been closed.

We said yes, paid, took our receipt, and then waited. 10 minutes flew by and we noticed the staff standing around doing nothing. So we asked about our order with a different cashier. She told us she didn't know about our order and went to check. She came back and said they'd run out of the 6inch cake but they had a 7inch. She went to get her manager, who then came up to us and said, ""Sorry we can't do that."" We were sooooo confused. Apparently cashier #2 told him we wanted the 7inch cake for the price of the 6inch. We hadn't asked for that. At all. So then he wanted to offer us a free slice on top of the 7inch cake that we had to pay the difference for. Nope, that's when we had had enough of this and asked for our money back.  Sorry, but I'm not stepping into a place of business where the manager starts off an apology by accusing us.

Gabe M.,"Boston, MA",16,10,13,4.0,9/2/2014,"My group of four ate here near just a few days ago a little after 10 PM. Luckily the wait was about ten minutes (just as the hostess had estimated). The host staff were very friendly. I did notice on our way to the table the the floor is very slick and must have grease or something on it. After being seated we began looking through the menu. Our waiter was awkward, but did get our orders right. I would have to note though that I had to ask for a straw three times and we had to ask for refills on drinks everytime. I have eaten at this specific store two prior times though and the waitstaff was much better each time.  The four of us ordered the macoroni and cheese burger with vegetarian patty, chicken and buscuit, BBQ chicken salad and a regular cheeseburger. I sampled a bit of everything and it was all delicious as always. We each got a piece of cheesecake as well and they all did not dissapoint.  Vegetarian options here are pretty decent considering that there is a veggie patty for burgers as well as salads and pastas that can be ordered without the meat(s).  I'm giving this four stars because the food and sweets are very delicious, there is a great selection (almost too big though), the room we were in was near a window and not too crowded or dark, and although the waiter on this occasion wasn't the most pleasant or helpful.  I would love to give a five star rating, but the greasy floor and not as clean as I would have expected bathroom situation had me a little worried about the kitchen situation and the waiter we had this time left us frustrated at times.

Kat M.,"Toronto, Canada",167,109,193,3.0,7/27/2014,"My first food stop during my trip to Boston was at this restaurant. My initial impression of the place was that it is a typical chain restaurant in terms of decor and menu items. They do offer a ""skinnylicious"" menu for those that are watching their calories.  I ordered the crab cake bites to start. I did not find anything too special about these items except that they were edible. I also ordered the smoked salmon spring rolls which I would suggest not ordering as they were not very impressive. I found the smoked salmon spring rolls to be bland and I essentially had to drench them in the sweet chill sauce that they came with in order to add some flavour to it.  For dessert I had the classic cheesecake with glazed strawberry. This cake is to die for. Absolutely heavenly. The cheesecake itself isn't dense and heavy, it was surprisingly light in texture and flavour and had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. The pie crust was a tad salty with hints of cinnamon flavour - a very good complement to the sweet cheesecake it holds. I really loved this dessert and recommend it to anyone craving something sweet.

Our server was super nice. Really perky and thorough with all the questions we had.  Maybe a little too perky. We almost always order the avocado egg rolls because they are pretty amazing, but decided to try things we've never tried before.  We went with the fire roasted chili rellenos, the chop salad, and salmon that was wrapped in a wonton wrapper.  Everything we had was pretty delicious!  The salad was fresh, the salmon didn't taste too fish'y, and the chili rellenos had a good amount of spice with lots of sauce surrounding it.

What I like about this place is the location. The Back Bay is a fine-dining mecca, there's no doubt about it. However, a lot of the venues are small, easily crowded, and quite honestly, feel like a gamble if you've never been there before.  Sometimes, you just don't want to deal with all that, and that's where good old Cheesecake Factory comes into play. The Cheesecake Factory is conveniently located on the Huntington side of The Shops at the Prudential Center. Around lunch, it's never busy so it's perfect for someone trying to escape their workplace breakroom to grab a quick lunch. The restaurant is HUGE, so when you spy a huge family with a crying baby settling in for dinner, you don't even sweat it--they might as well be miles away, you won't even be bothered by them.

Amy C.,"San Francisco, CA",299,410,1301,4.0,1/21/2016,"This review is simply for the cheesecakes and desserts at The Cheesecake Factory. I've never eaten a proper meal there, although I have seen their lunch and dinner menus, which seem overwhelming with the sheer number of items on the menu. From what I've heard, dessert is where The Cheesecake Factory excels, and entrees are not as much of a strength (mediocre and overpriced, from what I've heard). However, their cheesecakes are really phenomenal. They come in huge slices with mountains of whipped cream. As a whipped cream lover, I am a huge fan of the amount of whipped cream that goes onto these cheesecakes. They are perfect for sharing among a group of friends. Every July, The Cheesecake Factory restaurants nationwide also celebrate National Cheesecake Day with 50% of all cheesecake slices, so the cost of one slice drops down to about $3.50. One of my favorite desserts there (besides the cheesecakes) is the strawberry shortbread. This is a massive dessert with sugary, crunchy shortbread topped with a large quantity of fresh cut strawberries, with generous scoops of vanilla ice cream and swirls of whipped cream on top. At only $8 or $9, the amount of food is really good value.  The ambiance at this place is nice. It is a huge restaurant located in the Prudential Center, so even when there are a lot of patrons there isn't much of a wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=80

I know what to expect with any location that I visit. In the rare cases where they haven't delivered to my expectations, managers have stepped in to rectify for either quality (e.g., food came out cold) or service (e.g., unusually long wait for an order or waiter messed up the order). The menu is broad, you can come back over and over again to try something new. The portions are also generous (although I have noticed that they are a bit smaller these days than in the past - not sure if that is a trend or a few one-offs).

The first one was in 2013 in Palo Alto, bigger than this one, but all of these franchises share the same decoration, no matter the city or the building. First time I ordered a dish with salmon, I only remember it was yummy nothing else and for dessert a original cheesecake, a must if you come to this place. This last time there was a lane, so we needed to wait some minutes in order to hace dinner. After waiting, a member of the staff called us and took us to our table. I personally don't like how the service is managed, too exaggerated in my opinion, no need to give a speech or overact. Despite of this, he attended us pretty good, firstly taking note of the beverages ( the waiter exaggerating with every choice ) and then the food. We sticked with burgers, after three weeks I hadn't had one, so it was time to order one. I order it medium cook, but for my opinion it was overcooked, nevertheless to say it was good and yummy. You can order your burger with french fries or one kind of vegetables ( forget about ordering a mix of two or more ).

After being sat down we were promptly provided with the menu, as we were only there for cheesecake we flipped right to the back of the menu to view the sweets. We were shocked when the list of cheesecakes covered two entire pages.  Sadly my first choice of fresh blueberry and white chocolate had sold out, however our waitress recommended that I try the raspberry and white chocolate instead, so I did. The slices were not at all skimpy, so much so that my sugar levels were off the radar after finishing.  The cheesecake itself was moist and light with exceptional flavours running throughout. The bases was strong enough to support the weight and structure too so it didn't fall apart when you stuck your fork in.

Way back when, I used to work in one of these for a couple of months.  The menu is somehow more daunting as a diner than it is as a cook, and that's saying something.  I mean... look at this thing, who designed this menu?  It's like someone actually sat there and asked ""well, what about the people who don't like that"" to every culinary concept that came up and finally the pastry chef just said ""FUCK IT.  Let them have Italian, Chinese, French, American, AND Mexican food, I'm making fucking Cheesecake, bitches!""  I mean, I don't know if that's exactly how it went down, but the only other thing I can think of is that someone ate a bunch of recipes and then barfed them all back onto a menu. Anyway, the cheesecake they make is generally good for what it is, and the rest of the menu is a cluttered mishmash of various ethnic cuisines and standard American fare.  Do NOT take an indecisive eater here or you will be waiting for fucking ever for them to make up their minds, and who can blame them... the menu is like 300 pages.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=220

This is NOT a good place to go if you are counting calories or if you want attentive service. The location--right there in the Copley Mall area--is fantastic for tourists and visitors. The orange and green lines have subway stops right there. The interior design is dim with a great view outside, if you get a window seat. The booths are hard and uncomfortable but beautiful to look at. There are intriguing Eye-of-Sauron tribal lights on the sides of the booths... needless to say while waiting (and waiting...) for your food, your eyes will have plenty of decorations to look at. It was my birthday and while they did come out and sing to me and have a cute candle in the cheesecake, I would like to have ordered another drink or had a refill, but the waiter was never around. I realize it's a busy place, but they could have made so much more money if they had been attentive! We wanted more of that delicious bread and more cocktails, but the staff was always elsewhere. So hunt down your server and ask for more bread! It is fantabulous! The food itself was great once we finally got it! I LOVE that they have an entire diet menu, even if it has a silly name ""Skinnylicious."" The gripe I have with this is the entire menu says ""590 calories or less."" If you are health conscious enough to order off the diet menu, why don't they give exact calorie counts??? Not all meals have exactly 590 calories. Budgeting what I eat--what if one salad has 300 and the burger has all 590???? I wish they were more specific. Every single slice of cheesecake will be orgasmically good, just don't even bother calorie counting there. The lowest calorie slice is the Splenda with strawberries cheesecake with a hefty 610. (On my 1000 cal/day diet, this is quite a doozy.) Some of them have over 2,000 calories IN A SINGLE SLICE.

Orange Chicken was not really impressive. I'm a huge fan of Orange Chicken (ordering it at Cheesecake Factory already proves it!) and it was below average orange chicken among the ones I'd tasted, yet was also the most expensive one. However, white cream pasta (forgot exact name), BBQ burger were good.  And Jamaican Shrimp and Chicken (with Curry sauce) was fantastic! I'd recommend this dish to anyone.  However, their service and place maintenance is awful. Perhaps these non-food materials take 1-2 stars off of them. I see some Yelpers giving 1 stars due to their service, and I totally understand them. Floor is so slippery, I felt like somebody spilled oil on the floor or something. Hostesses always underestimate the waiting time. When they say it would be 10 minutes waiting, they call me like 25 minutes later. When they call 20 minutes, I get called after 30+ minutes. Some may have no problem with that business strategy, but I am always irritated by it. When they say 10 minutes, I expect to be seated at least within 15 minutes, not 25+.  I wouldn't say much about waiters. I remember when I visited here with 3 of my college friends, the waiter was really annoying. He was slow, didn't come to take order for like 20 minutes, and didn't refill water. Though, in my recent visit, waitress was so kind, asked for order frequently (yeah we asked for extra minutes to decide what to get like 3 times), and even after placing an order, she came back to us and told us that our dishes are being prepared and would come out in several minutes.  So I guess it just depends on who you get as your server. Overall, my experiences here has been okay. I know I will get good food when I go there, it's all about other factors (price, waiting time, service, maintenance, etc) that changes the dining experience for the night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=220

Nessa M.,"Bristol, RI",35,86,1,1.0,5/25/2013,"They failed they failed they failed. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in this place. Twice I tried to eat here during Anime Boston and twice they tried to kill me!! IF YOU HAVE A FOOD ALLERGY JUST STAY AWAY THEY ARE UTTERLY INCOMPETENT!!!!!! First fail happened when the moron waitress gave me a Dr. Pepper instead of a root beer. I immediately went into anaphalaxis and had to use my epi pen. Obviously we left. The Providence location is awesome, so I had high hopes for this place, so in thinking it was just the waitress who failed, we decided to give them another chance. I ordered a pasta dish loaded with garlic and substituted the shrimp for chicken. While I'm not allergic to shrimp, I'm pretty much allergic to every other kind of seafood, and since shrimp is commonly contaminated by other seafood, I thought chicken would be safe. I informed my waitress that I had a major seafood allergy and told her I wanted chicken instead. Well, what ended up on my plate? I found 2 stray pieces of shrimp in my dish. I refused to touch it and we left. Never again Boston Cheesecake Factory, never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=200
Lauren W.,"Charlestown, MA",16,90,4,2.0,2/13/2013,"My friend and I recently dined at this establishment.  Let's face it, it's a standard chain, with standard food. Not that the food was particularly bad, but it wasn't particularly good either.  Service was pretty blah. Our waiter didn't do anything crazy, it was more what he didn't do. For example, he certainly didn't pick up dirty dishes, and our dirty appetizer plates were on the table until the end of the meal, and he certainly didn't check up on his often, as water glasses were dry and ready to be filled most of the meal.  If you expect good service or exciting food, this may not be your place. If you're happy with standard chain fare, with poor service, then this is it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=200
Diane H.,"Boston, MA",436,685,726,4.0,8/27/2011,"I love the cheesecake factory---for its cheesecakes and their food. Usually there's some sort of wait--maybe a 15 min wait at this location, but this past friday, there was no wait at 6pm! Our server was nice, but he didn't give me my water with lime, and i mentioned lime 3 times..making sure he understood, and my friend didn't get a lemon with his water. Their nachos with the spicy chicken--GET IT! Would be better with more cheese, just because I love cheese, but it's sooo good. The fried calamari was delicious, especially paired with the cocktail sauce, the other garlic sauce? My friend says not so much. My other friend enjoyed his Margarita flat bread. I wish I got a taste of it, so I can tell you whether it's good or not, but it looked pretty appetizing! And again, our server did not rush us out, and he tried to sell us some desserts, but alas, we weren't that hungry after we devoured our meal. Their cheese cake is good, as with all the other locations. The tirimisu cake is my favorite..Their mojito is pretty good too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=200
Courtney T.,"Pawtucket, RI",190,5,,1.0,4/2/2016,"Cheesecake Factory in Cambridge, MA is beyond the most racist, impolite, and ridiculous restaurant I have ever gone too. First, a kid that was with my cousin and a group of friends went to go make a reservation for the 10 of us. They told him 2 hours and he walked away (he's Cape Verdean). Not even 15 minutes later I came back to make a reservation myself because we decided we would wait and for 15 people because more people came than expected. When I went in their, I was told one hour for 15 people. I would just like to say that is white privileges, obviously.  After the one hour (and a half) wait we were finally seated. During the wait, someone who was in our group was asked by his mother to buy some milk to bring home for the house. He did this before because CVS was closing at 9 and it was around 8:45. CVS gave him a brown paper bag for his two half gallons of milk that said CVS on it. After being seated after the long wait, we received a dirty table, dirty clothes, and dirty plates/silverware.  When the kid asked if they had milk for him to have with his food, they said that they did not have any. He then asked if the waitress could give him a cup so he could pour his milk into the cup. He even said they could charge him for the cup and continued to show them the milk that was in the paper bag. The waitress said ""Okay, I will be right back with everything."" After awhile of waiting, we saw not one, not two, not three, BUT FIVE police officers approaching us. When I asked what the situation or problem was they told us that a manager was told that we were pouring alcohol into our drinks. Mind you, we were there celebrating a friends birthday and my cousins confirmation!  The police officers then took the milk away and smelt it and declared that the milk was JUST MILK. They apologized then walked away. How embarrassing right? Due to the obvious fact that us and the waitress was uncomfortable I politely went up to a manager at the front desk and requested a new waiter/waitress because it was an embarrassing and awkward situation for not only us, but the waitress too. They said ""okay, yeah. No problem, I'll be right on that"". After the waitress coming back a total of 5 times, I went to the bathroom and decided to call my cousins mom. As I was telling her the story and what the police officers said to me and everything that was going on, a Manager who wasn't even dealing with my table got in my face screaming at me saying we were being disruptive and that she was going to kick us out if I didn't stop telling my Aunt the situation that was occurring. I told her that I'm on a personal phone call what I say is none of her business and that I said exactly what the officer told me he was called for. (The officer even asked us to see some of our drinks!). She then left the bathroom (didn't use the bathroom) while laughing and calling me a bitch. Due to this altercation, I was recorded by some girls in the bathroom behind me, so once again, an embarrassing situation. I could have been lying out of my ass (WHICH I WASN'T!) and she still had no right to put her two sense into my personal conversation. After the bathroom, I went to go talk to another manager. While I was gone she continuously walked by my table laughing then asked ""where is that white girl at"" (mind you she's a fat white girl, not that her physical appearance matters). When talking to the head managed, Clint I believe was his name, I was told that I was lying and that he knows these employees well and that both the girls saw a bottle of alcohol. No alcohol was found when the police searched us, our table, the bags, and our milk/drinks. Notice how he said two girls, we had one boy and one girl!  My uncle came in and demanded an apology and they offered an order on the house. We denied and said that we just wanted an apology. He continued to say we can afford our own food, just that we also deserved to be respected. We then checked everyone's receipt and made sure everything was paid for (I DID THIS MYSELF, PERSONALLY). We even left an extra $20 to show that we didn't come here for a scene and that we came here to eat properly. As the group tried to leave they stopped and said we still owed them money and that we didn't pay. They then argued for awhile saying we should have kept our receipt (they collected it from us). They then discovered that they made ANOTHER mistake and that we did pay and left the extra $20. Not that it matter since they even offered to put the order on the house!  There was a total of 12 of us for our 15 people reservation. I was the ONLY white one. Along with that, this all occurred before we even received our food. I didn't even eat it I was so aggravated that I lost my appetite. They even accused of us saying we put alcohol in our drinks (why would we even tell our server that if we did?)  Moral of the story: don't bring milk to CheeseCake Factory. You'll be arrested for underage drinking.they don't even deserve half a star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=200
Vanessa W.,"Acton, MA",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2015,"I m in luck! It has been 2 years since my last time here. If my friend did not give me its gift card, I would never come back. So today I decided to give it 2nd chance by going to its store in difference location, and here is what happened again: a tiny wood stick was found in my artichoke dip. After a closer look, I found out it is the tip part of a toothpick! which reminds me what happened on 2013 Mother's day:  Huge disappointment, ruined my Mother's day: I am so regret to take my mom there for lunch on Mother's day! First of all, it took us more than 30 minutes wait for our food served. There were not even many people at that time. Both sides of our neighbors' food were ready and they came later than us , we still sat there waiting. All I ordered was burger and my mom had wasabi tuna. It should not take that long. But fine, it's Mother's day. It's not like me and my mom were in a hurry anyway. We wanted to take our time, enjoy the beautiful day. It was not easy to spend some quality time together, and to celebrate the day, when she lives in another continent across the ocean. However, as our lunch towards end, here came the WORST part: I noticed there was a fruit TAG in my mom's plate, mingled with rice! The manager came to explain: they used orange peels for the dish. The tag may fall into the plate accidentally when peeling the orange skin.They could take away the rest of my mom's food, and gave us a piece of free cheese cake as apology. Here I think is the funny part: 1. I don't want to know why/how the fruit tag get into the dish. 2. Sure, they could add orange peel but it doesn't mean it's OK to get into the plate. 3.  All they offered is just taking the plate away, and offering a piece of cake to fix the problem. We paid for the meal, and did not even finished it. My mom meant to box the rest before I found the tag. So in the end, they gave us a newly cooked, equal portion of the left meal, and a piece of cake. My mom is ok with it. But I am totally upset by what happened. That my mom kept telling me she's fine, and still had good time with me made me fell even worse. Very unpleasant experience! I am still upset even by now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=200
Josh R.,"Boston, MA",59,174,,3.0,3/11/2013,"Food was alright although the wait was terribly long as we went by on a weekend. I had the nachos, which was a huge portion fit for two. Although it was an appetizer, it really should have been listed under entrees! The chicken salad was also a massive portion. We were so full that we did not order mains after that.  The food was okay, but it's become the kind of chain restaurant that I wouldn't go for a special occasion like a birthday celebration. The wait was long although service was decent. Dessert is the big hit here of course, like the Godiva Cheesecake and Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake. Excellent desserts, whole meals on their own. Actually, to skip the lines and have the best food available (cheesecake), I think the next time I'll go have dinner elsewhere with a shorter waiting line and either come here for dessert after the dinner crowd is gone; or even take home the cheesecakes for some delectable, delicious end of meal savoring!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=200

The pear martini is a little too sweet for me.  My favorite cheesecakes are: Adam's PB Cup, Stephanie's Red Velvet and Chocolate Tuxedo Cream.  I don't eat here often, I'd be 300 lbs, if I did, so it's always a welcome treat to go here and indulge a little!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=200
Charlena K.,"Boston, MA",11,102,46,4.0,3/5/2013,"4 STAR DINING IN: My boyfriend and I visited this location while on vacation once and now that we're official Bostonians, we frequent this spot. We are literal junkies for the red velvet cheesecake! The food is decent, my favorite dish is the Chicken Di Pana and my boyfriend's was Mexico City. They cancelled it; life went on, he ordered something else, but it's such a pain when companies get rid of classics and things that their consumers like! The (non-alcoholic) tropical smoothie is also amaze- perfectly blended and super fresh and fruity! Honestly, if it weren't for the fruit smoothie and cheesecake (mostly the cheesecake), I wouldn't necessarily care to eat here because the food options are limited (they're all basic variations of the same main dish). The customer service is good, nothing to rant or rave about. Friday and Saturday nights have unnecessarily extended wait times. PROS: Great location, great dessert, nice ambiance, CONS: long wait times, decent/somewhat bland meals that are slightly overpriced --- 5 STAR CATERING: My sisters and I used their catering service for my mom's bridal shower/bachelorette party in August. Food was prepared on time and nicely packaged/handled. It was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced considering it was catered Cheesecake Factory.

The waiters usually bring our entrees out when we're still eating our appetizer...and it's extremely frustrating because our food just sits on our table and starts to get warm - not the out-of-the-oven HOT that you expect it to be.

Dani S.,"Boston, MA",234,44,8,3.0,12/12/2013,"Where do I start? The food here is great. But the servings are HUGE. Even the allegedly ""Skinny"" menu servings are large. All the food - cheesecake and otherwise - is quite good. It's the decor that throws me a little. It's perfect in a way. Warm lighting, soft calm colored walls reminiscent of a cozy little Italian restaurant, and clean. Super clean. So why 3 stars?  It's too perfect. Although it tries to be warm and cozy, it fails to achieve such a feeling. The mix of the super-cleanliness and the high ceilings (All of which are nice), it still gives off a feeling of trying too hard. And it's this feeling that takes away from what otherwise could be a very pleasant atmosphere.  If the feeling and looks of a place don't affect you much, and all you really care about is food, then I'd recommend it.

Now I'm not expecting dinner and a show, but I do expect some type of friendly engagement with a bartender.  You'd think that since Saturday mornings at noon aren't exactly heavy drinking times, if you were a bartender, you would at least chat up your guests to see how they're doing, talk about the weather, or ask if they were from Boston ... anything.  This bartender wanted to be anywhere but at work.  I sat down at the bar, perused the menu and was greeted with ""Whatdaya want to drink?""  Is this a diner on a New Jersey roadside? I ordered lunch and he chatted up a buddy of his at the bar in regards to their latest gym session.  I had some time to kill, not all afternoon.  It must have been at least five minutes before he put my order in the computer.  Since it wasn't too busy, I figured it wouldn't take too long.   My lunch came out and it was just as delicious as I've had in the past.  I ate quickly and then practically had to flag the bartender down to run my credit card through.   I'm definitely thinking that I won't be back at this location any time soon.  I'm sure the other staff are friendly and efficient, but since I'm frequently over here by myself, I don't think I'd be apt to sit at the bar.  Bar-goers beware!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=140

Amanda L.,"Boston, MA",67,171,,2.0,5/15/2015,"I've always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but alas, I think I've finally grown up and have realized how mediocre it really is.  Before I start my rant on yesterday's 'meh' experience I'd like to clarify - the cheesecake is still BOMB. My boyfriend and I got the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake to take home and share over the next few days. It's seriously rich, but seriously delicious. Now, back to yesterday's experience. When we got there around 6/6:15 there was a short wait. We put our name in for 2 and stayed in front of the host stand. 15 minutes went by and we noticed people were going up to the stand (after we had already been there) and were being called before us. Hmm. My boyfriend went to check on the status of our table and the hostess rudely mentioned she had called his name. Mmmmm. Nope. So we waited a few more minutes until she felt it was appropriate to have someone seat us. Another girl brought us to our table. We went to the right of the host stand, along the wall to the back of the bar area, left into the bar area, and through the bar area back up to the front. In short, we could have turned left at the host stand and saved a minute or two weaving through congestion. Le sigh. Apparently being a host at this place requires having a pulse. A brain? Not necessary. Our server was friendly, quick to bring the beverages and gave us an ample amount of time to review the novel of a menu this place has.  Sidenote: my boyfriend always wants to avoid TCF claiming the menu is too big and they make everything 'fine' but nothing 'well.' In short, it's been a challenge to get him to want to come here with me in our two years of being together. Anywho, I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. Thank God my boyfriend doesn't read Yelp reviews because it was exactly how he describes food at TCF - 'fine.' The sauce was 'nice' with a good amount of heat, but the dish was covered in toasted coconut that seemed like it would have gone better with a dessert than a savory dish. In short, this visit made me realize how many better options there are in Boston for dining out. I've realized why I haven't been back to the Cheesecake Factory in so long, and why I won't be going back any time soon unless it's to grab a piece of cheesecake to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=140

Ngan T.,"Palo Alto, CA",436,266,30,1.0,10/6/2013,"I love food from the cheesecake factory--don't get me wrong. I've eaten from enough cheesecake factories to know this menu top to bottom, front to back. So as you can expect, I've got a couple things Ialways order and a couple of preferences that come with it. Here's how my experience usually pans out at this location: Get seated, wait, give up and get up to find a waiter, put in an order for the miso salmon with white rice and extra sauces on the wide. After not seeing my waiter, hail one down for bread and butter. Salmon comes without extra sauces and occasionally brown rice instead of white. I'll wait ten minutes after I've licked my plate clean before waiter comes back.  Anyway, you get the point. I love this place because it has everything but it's always terrible service. As for the other dishes--well with this menu, everyone can find something they like. I like the crab cakes. There's just enough crab meat to keep me from complaining for more. Calamari is usually done right. but the dipping sauce has too much....is it horseradish in that thing? I'm not a fan. Most of the pasta dishes not in a red sauce are VERY salty. Eater beware.

Querby J.,"Everett, MA",122,66,137,3.0,3/23/2016,So this Cheesecake Factory has a lot of good and bad things about it. Okay let's first start off with the fact that they don't take reservations so depending on what day and time you go be prepared for a wait. Because I've been here before on a Saturday and it was packed with an hour wait. But I came here today on a Wednesday night and there was no wait at all. So it's pretty much luck of the draw. I went with a group of 4 and managed to get a booth seat. As an appetizer I got the buffalo wings. They were good but the skin was kind of chewy. The buffalo wings aren't that spicy so those with timid taste buds have no fear. My friend asked for the shrimp scampi pasta and they messed up her order so make sure your waiter understands your order. As a quick side note the bathroom here is mad nice. The lighting in there (and the whole restaurant at that) is really dim. Nice for the atmosphere but terrible for pictures (hence why my food pictures suck & I'm not a good photographer). My main dish I got the Cajan Jambalaya Pasta. I'm a person that enjoys extremely spicy food and the description of the Cajan Jambalaya Pasta said that it was in a very spice sauce and it really wasn't even that spicy. So don't be fooled. It's still a great dish though (enjoy the picture of me obnoxiously eating my pasta). For the desert I got the Dulce De Leche Cheesecake. Okay this had to be my favorite part of the meal! I'm not usually a fan of Cheesecake Factory cheesecake surprisingly. But this one has me re-questioning not liking their cheesecake because this cheesecake was fucking delicious! If you're a fan of caramel this is the one for you. Delicious and it cuts real smooth. Make sure to get the whip cream with it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=140
Abby R.,"Cambridge, MA",588,267,38,2.0,9/16/2014,"It's definitely not the best location of this chain. The inside is laid out very awkwardly, almost like there are two different restaurants that sort of melted together.

Again - they're amazing! Our favorite things to eat here are the Friend Macaroni and Cheese, and any of the pastas. The cheesecake, of course, is unsurpassed - the Fresh Banana, S'Mores, and Ultimate Red Velvet probably at the top of my list. It's really a classy and delicious place to spend your evening.

When confronted about this, the waiter instead of understanding our disappointment, was just plain dismissive.

J T.,"Cambridge, MA",48,89,58,4.0,12/4/2013,"If the machines in""The Matrix"" tried to create a three or four star, vaguely Italian catch-all chain of restaurants, The Cheesecake Factory is what they might come up with. The ambiance is impressive, on the brink of oppressive, with soft lighting, walls that imply rustic texture, and ornamental fixtures at every turn (of which there are many). Indeed, every inch of the cheesecake factory seems to have been designed with care and intelligence for a life-like traditional dining experience. It is this impeccable attention to detail, multiplied by 1000, which results in something other than coziness. There are few if any dusty corners, no cracks to go along with the vintage plaster appearance of the walls, no fading of the colors or warping of the glass. In short, it's perfect in a way that life is not. The menu is absurd and overwhelming. Maybe it's designed to provide for the varied desires of large groups, on multiple occasions, or maybe it's just a show of corporate force. Either way you simply can't comprehend the full extent of the choices.  This begs the question, what is it that you're supposed to think of when you consider the cheesecake factory? Well, namely, cheesecake. It's a megalith built on the idea of dessert, but outrageously overblown.  Even the servers are sanitized and multiplied, dozens of them on any given night, dressed all in white instead of the usual black. Unique? Yes. When multiplied by dozens upon dozens? Not so much. Which brings it back to the patrons. Somehow the place doesn't, and I suspect couldn't, ever really feel full. Even when every one of the hundreds of seats is filled The Cheesecake Factory has the feeling of exactly that, a factory. Customers are the raw material. Money is the product.

The two redeeming qualities of The Cheesecake Factory are its cheesecakes & location.  Its cheesecakes (at least the ones I've tried) are good, & the restaurant is conveniently located inside the Pru, just steps from the entrance to the Prudential stop on the green line.  Its convenient location, however, can also be a bit of a drawback -- the place gets very crowded Friday & Saturday nights.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=240

They have just about everything from American to Italian to Asian to Mexican and more... so chances are you'll find something you like. It is VERY easy to succumb to weakness here and order the comfort food choices. The mac and cheese balls? DELICIOUS but over a thousand calories.

Chris C.,"South End, Boston, MA",138,119,,3.0,2/24/2012,"Fat G. counting the hours till the end of this workweek. And so, we come to a review of a place that most people have seen before, not necessarily been to. The Cheesecake Factory is located in the Copley Mall, near Barnes and Nobles. Come inside, and there's a waiting area as well as a place to order desserts for take-out. There are a lot of tables, a small bar, and seating in the back, which has windows allowing you to see out into the street. Ambiance is tough to describe - it's not candlelight, but it's dim. A friend of mine said that when he hears Cheesecake Factory, he thinks pasta. Aside from cheesecake, I'm not really sure what to get this time. Having remembered being here before for a party, I opted to order a pizza instead of getting one of their pasta dishes (it comes on one of those big plates, but only 1/2 of it is actually food.) They have a wine menu, and a good variety on the menu, ranging from sandwiches, pastas, soups, salads, desserts, pizzas, seafood, etc.  The Everything Pizza had its fair share of cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage and onions. Though I was a bit disappointed, because the slices felt firm on the top half, but kinda wet and soft on the bottom half. Think a trapezoid of decent pizza, and a small triangle of sadness. The pizza was about $13, which i guess is ok. The waiter looked sad when everyone ordered water, and didn't want dessert... It's an alright place, but not a place I'd frequent regularly. You really come here for the  romantic atmosphere and the cheesecake, but that's really it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=240

Tanya Y.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",344,200,547,3.0,5/9/2010,"BANG BANG!    ....chicken and shrimp!   So good! The Cheesecake Factory is somewhat over rated to me.  Although their food quality is good, their menu endless, and location superb, the price stops me dead in my tracks from coming back here [I only come back on special occasions].   All of the wait staff that I have encountered have been friendly and seem very knowledgable about their menu, which is a plus.  Bread and butter is always given at the biginning of the meal, which is delicious.   I always order the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, which consists of white jasmine rice with shrimp and chicken coconut curry -- it is amazing!  The portion is decent -- I ALWAYS doggy bag about half to leave room for Cheesecake. If I could give 5 stars to solely the Cheesecake component of the restaurant, I would.  They have a variety of different flavor combinations all ranging from about $6-7.  Sooo good!  Theyre extremely rich, however, and one slice is good enough to share amongst 2-3 people. For approximately $20 per visit, I do get full, but am 110% positive that I can find good food much similar to this elsewhere for a cheaper price.  Overall do I recommend this place?

Tony S.,"Boston, MA",222,441,197,4.0,3/8/2009,"Started sucky, but ended like a good Pam Anderson home video.  I usually don't Yelp about major, fan-famous food joints, but my experience here yesterday warranted a review. I went there with 7.5 family members (0.5 for the new pint-sized addition that's all of 8 months old), around 3pm-ish (to escape the horrendous dinner crowd that NEVER seems to go away. Now, I'm a Cheesecake factory regular up and down Southern California, so I'm used to the all-to-infamous crappy-hostess-that-makes-you-wait-because-I'm-too-good-for-you attitude, but yesterday they took it to a new level. There were about 3 hostess' there, and they all acknowledged that I had 7.5 people, and the wait would be about 5-10 minutes. About 30 people piled in after our group, including a party of 8 and party of 6. Within 15 minutes, both groups got seated before me. 35 minutes later (which is my normal Cheesecake factory fook-it--gimme-my-damn-table-now bar), we were still waiting, and I sent in the family informer (my 3 year old daughter) to ask if our table was ready. Nope. Granted, one of the girls came up and ""double-checked"" on my table needs (which we all know is industry lingo for ""oops, we totally fooked up your table order""). At this stage, the family psycho (my sister) took over. Now... here is my issue. I'm from LA. I'm used to waits, unless I'm with my celeb friends. And I'm the pretty laid-back mellow fellow that doesn't get mad at a lot of things that typically drive others nuts. BUT, at least the host/hostess has always been frank about it and managed my expectations. This snooty blondie I-think-I'm-hot-and-have-the-power 4'5"" barbie-wannabe didnt' even have the courtesy to apologize or excuse herself, and simpy said ""well if you have an issue, I""ll get the manager.."".   Dude, this is Boston, not LA. I frickin own you, you $5.50/hour bimbette that actually didn't brush your teeth properly because you had ass-breath underneath that cheap-excuse of an immitation tic-tac you chewed on an hour ago. At this stage, I started to get...... sweaty palms... not a good sign if you're 1/2 Sicilian like me. That's usually the first step before I threaten somebody with ""i know where you live..."" Now... the good thing, the manager, a nice lady named Katrina, came out, very nice, very apologetic (and hey, even if she was acting, she acted well), walked us to our table, and gave us all our appetizer orders on the house. Now... psycho sister took that offer to the max with 5 appies, but for myself, I really liked that she at least had a great attitude. I've been in the food business, hotel business, and rent-a-car business. People mess up all the time by mistake. But have the decency to keep the customer/client happy and manage their expectations. Frickin apologize if you fook up.  I was so ready to slam this place down with my lawsuit forte (18 and counting, and all wins so far), but Katrina saved the day, and gave us a very friendly, very helpful water named Gray (yes, like the color).  I was happy, gave Gray a very generous tip (gave him what the appies would have cost), because I personally don't give a hoot about freebies in an upscale environment. I just want good food and service. The food? LOVED the Bang-Bang Thai chicken, the Thai Lettuce wraps, the crispy spicy beef, and the avocado eggrolls (VERY creative). The fish tacos were a total miss. I'm a fish taco connaisseur, a these were a yuckfest. The kids loved the cheese pizza, and the garlic noodles were decent. Banana cheesecake, and strawberry cheesecake were up to par (great).

I've been here multiple times and each time, my waiter/waitress introduces his/herself, regularly checks up on us and asks us if everything is alright, and brings out our food quickly. Some of the staff here take their time to actually talk to their customers and hold small conversations with them. Overall, I really love their staff.  Another nice thing about this restaurant is the design of the place. I love looking around because the lighting is slightly dim and it has a nice feel to it.  Whenever I come here, I always get the strawberry lemonade. They rim the cup with sugar and my friends can't help but sneak a sip of my drink. It's delicious. Their food will be the reason I die young. I love their spicy chicken chipotle pasta. Again, not the kind of food you would eat if you're trying to be healthy, but it's great for satisfying your guilty conscience.

I just gotta get this off my chest-when I hear the words ""Cheesecake Factory"" I imagine a giant warehouse with conveyor belts spitting out cheesecakes. But oh was I in for a surprise! The Cheesecake Factory is not a FACTORY per se, rather a nice dimly lit Arabic-esque restaurant. Let's start with the bread-the brown bread is fantastic. For my entree I got the buffalo blisters, four cheese pasta with shrimp, and a loaded factory burrito. Are all of it in 7.5 minutes. It was so good that I ordered round two of all the entrees. Went to the bathroom, pulled the trigger and threw up course number one to make room for course number two, three, and four. Then I was ready to roll into flavor town.

A group of 24 of us came to the restaurant (reservation at 6PM, but of course, only 19 of us were there by 6:10PM). Even though on the phone, they had said we couldn't be seated until the entire party was seated, they graciously seated us in the back with two gigantic tables where we could be loud and rowdy like how birthday guests are supposed to be without being completely isolated from the restaurant.  I won't comment too much on food since it's pretty standard - many of us ordered from the skinnylicious menu for the first time, which was a little small portioned, but to be expected. Regular menu items were MASSIVE (definitely two meals worthy if you want to save money/ prevent obesity).  When it came to checks, they separated everyone's bills in an orderly and prompt way, which included 20% gratuity so no one had to embarrass themselves by pulling out the cell phone calculator.  I usually dread large birthday dinners because when money's all pooled together on one check, there's ALWAYS $10 missing somehow. Cheesecake factory made it easy for people to be accountable and service for such a large group was impeccable.

(Minus one) After being sat our server came over right away! Let me tell you that we was thirsty! So this is a huge plus. We ordered a few sodas! The server was pretty nice and told us all of the specials at this time as well. He had our sodas out pretty quickly! Upon his return we then ordered our app and 2 meals.  For our app we got a side salad to share! It was awesome! The lettuce was very good. Romaine lettuce and spinach leaves with tomatoes and cucumbers! The house dressing was JUST AMAZING! I love their salads for that alone! Plus it was huge! So its really good for 2 people easy! huge thumbs up! Even for a side this would have been amazing. For a meal I got the four cheese pasta with chicken. All I can say is YUMMY! This is a MUST try for anyone who loves cheese! It blended SO well together. My taste buds want more just writing this review! Its that bad ass! We also ordered the orange chicken meal. It came with 12 PEACES OF CHICKEN! Fried with batter to perfection! Its a basic meal but they do it so well! VERY yummy! If you like orange chicken than you will love it! The only issue that we had here again was...SLOW! Took a good hour or so to get our meals. If you couldn't tell it was still well worth the wait! During our meal our server made sure our drinks where full. He did however take a little bit to come back to check on how the food was. I think he must have been pretty busy. So after dinner we ordered a tiramisu to go! Again it was slow getting it! We waited a good 20 minutes for them to get this ready for us. After paying for everything. So it was a hold up. By the time we got it home and walked off some of our food we had this for dessert! Yummy it was! Again it was worth the wait! So for everything we got we ended up with a bill of $65.00. That included a good tip. We knew the server was busy. Everything came out perfect! If they had done a little better on time this is and EASY 5/5! So I'm only taking one star away for the time and skipping over us while seating others. VERY STRONG 4/5! Oh we will be going back! The time is such a minor thing when your hungry! Because their food is just that good! Its worth the wait!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=280

Sheila K.,"Jersey City, NJ",406,57,64,1.0,5/25/2011,"Eek! Methinks not, for sure. I went with a friend. The entrance was overly crowded with people just standing around waiting for the buzzer thingies to buzz. After standing for five minutes in the crowd, I realized I should probably just push my way to the desk, which I did. The hosts and hostesses were scrambling around in and out of the desk and when I asked for a table for two, one of them handed me a buzzer, took my name, and told me the wait would be at most 30 minutes. Okay. My friend wanted to try Cheesecake Factory and it was lunch time, so I wasn't too bothered by the wait time. So we waited. After 30 minutes the buzzer had not buzzed. We kept saying that it would probably beep any minute now and ended up waiting over an hour before we confronted them. Of course, we were a little dumb for waiting so long to do so. The hostess apologized and told us it would be another ten minutes. Thank goodness it ended up only being a short minute. We were seated and ready to order. Unfortunately it took quite a while for our waiter to arrive. I asked for recommendations, which I usually do as I enjoy hearing their opinions. With his opinion I ordered the fish tacos with fried fish and a cup of the soup of the day, some sort of corn chowder. My friend ordered the miso salmon. The waiter came out with a  bowl, not a cup, of the soup. I really wasn't in the mood to point it out so I ended up paying for the bowl. The soup was pretty good. The fish tacos were not. The tacos were bland and I actually only ate one, gave one to my friend and left the plate half full. I didn't really want to take it back with me. My friend's miso salmon was really good at first. But then it started getting too heavy. I think they need to add more vegetables to the dish; it's basically salmon on top of rice with five snap peas. it was my friend's birthday so on the way to the restroom, I let my waiter know. We got a complimentary cheesecake and that was the highlight of the meal. The cheesecake, of course, was delicious. With the extremely long wait, bland food, and expensive bill, I was thoroughly disappointed in this Cheesecake Factory. The waitstaff were not particularly attentive and it seemed too disorganized.

Anthony C.,"Boston, MA",0,14,,1.0,3/28/2012,"I come to this location quiet often and I'm always pleased with the food and service.  However, this past Sunday we had a terrible experience.  The waiter was very personable and checked in with us often but I just don't think he listened to anything we said.  I have a very serious food allergy and told him what I was allergic to and if he could check with the chef to make sure everything was okay.  (A few restaurants in Boston are really good with allergies and have a manager or even chef come over to go over what your having and ensure that everything is safe).  We placed our order, we got Buffalo Blasts for our appetizer and it was really good.  For our Main course, my gf got a Teriyaki entrée and I got a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  I'm allergic to sesame seeds and when our food came my burger had a sesame seed bun..  People make mistakes, I get it.. the slip might not have said it or maybe they forgot, but you think the waiter would have noticed..  Anyway, I let him know how serious the allergy was an if I could get another one without the sesame roll.  He took it away and about 10 minutes later a manager came over and apologized.  The burger came back over, it was lettuce and a slab of meat and cheese on the plate.. Where are my fries, my bacon and my bun.  Are you telling me you don't have plain rolls?  He forgot and brought over a plain  roll and said 'oh the fries, yea they umm contain your allergy'.. I've ate here a million times, no they don't.. They need to take allergy's at the Cheesecake factory much more serious. When we got the bill they didn't comp the burger, they did add it twice and then take one away, which I thought was kind of messed up..  When we got home we noticed that our takeout back was covered in teriyaki sauce because they didn't fasten the lid.  Just an overall bad experience.  Basically we paid $60 bucks for an Amstel light and a tea.

Gary T.,"San Antonio, TX",50,361,74,4.0,4/19/2011,"Decadence never tasted so good! This wasn't the first Cheesecake Factory that we have been to and I usually try to avoid chain restaurants unless I get out-voted,LOL. However, the Cheesecake Factory is now one of the places we actively seek out when we need to satisfy our sweet tooth. This particular CF is located in a really nice mall near the Prudential Center in Boston. We went on a weeknight around 7pm and it was as crowded as you would expect on a weekend. I had the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the wife had the Tiramisu Cheesecake, both were equally delicious. You get very generous portions for the price and I can tell by taste of their cheesecake that they use high-quality ingredients.  The only advice I would give about going here is don't order the cheesecake for desert if you have already eaten here or somewhere else because they give you so much that the cheesecake is a meal in itself,LOL. Also, if you are sensitive to sugar, they have a cheesecake here that is sweetened with Splenda, which I think I may try since eating their cheesecake more than once or twice a month might give me diabetes,LOL. The staff here was very friendly and the service was quick although I would watch your order to make sure they got it right since they are so busy, the person in front of us had some order problems and you could tell it was because the staff are so busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=280

Andrew G.,"CHESTNUT HILL, MA",0,26,1,4.0,7/27/2012,"Cheesecake Factory has to be one of my favorite ""Go-To"" Places of all time. I've been to them in NJ, MA, VA, MD, and a few other states I'm sure. I have one simple rule when I go to Cheescake Factory (no, its not try to eat an entire cheesecake by myself) its that I will never try something on the menu twice. Just won't do it. There has to be over 200 menu items everyday, so I think its an injustice to limit myself to the same thing. I have never had a dish that I have not liked here The last time I came was for dinner on a Saturday night in March maybe. We were seated within 10 minutes which was a surprise. Its inside the Prudential Center, so there's plenty to do while you wait anwyay, but definitely come early because this place gets PACKED! We started out with chips and guacamole. Now, I am not a guacamole ""snob"" whatsoever (I probably couldn't even tell you the difference between really good and really average guacamole to be honest), but I thought this stuff was pretty good. They came to the table and mashed it up right in front of you and gave us plenty of chips. You can get mild, medium, or spicy, but we opted for mild and I thought it was great. Pretty sure that was less than $10 too which is great.  Today I ordered Stuffed chicken Tortillas and they did not disappoint. As usual the plate was HUGE! Tortillas were fresh and bursting at the seams with chicken, cheese, peppers, onion, and cilantro. It was served with black beans and a sweet corn cake that was awesome! I'm not too familiar with Spanish/Mexican cooking but that corn cake was just so good- a perfect complement to the spiciness of the salsa. Honestly, do not even remember what my friend got because I was so engulfed in my food. In the past I've had Huevos Rancheros for brunch which was delicious (and huge..actually I'm going to stop saying meals are huge because I am pretty sure its implied at this point. You do NOT go to this place on a diet).  I've had Jambalaya Pasta with seafood where the sauce was perfectly made and you could really taste the layering of flavors. I've had the little pizzettes with sausage and ricotta as a ""small plate"" that were awesome. Corn tamales are delicious.  One day after purging myself with fast food, I even ordered a salad at this place (Me...a salad?). To this day, the Factory Chopped Salad is one of my favorite salads ever. Its actually listed as an appaetizer but I couldn't even finish it. Lettuce, avocado, bacon, apples...everything you could want in a salad and more. Do I even need to describe the cheesecake? Heavenly. My favorites so far have been Red Velvet, Oreo Crumble, and Dutch Apple. The truly unfair part is by the time I'm always done eating my dinner, I barely have room to split a slice with somebody! And I'm not talking ""I think I ate too much I better stop here"" full...I'm talking ""I cannot physically open my mouth anymore because there is so much food inside me"" full.  Cheesecake Factory is just good. They serve meals from all kinds of backgrounds in huge portions. Is the most authentic food you'll ever eat? Definitely not. Is it absolutelt delicious food that will keep you coming back when you get the craving? Uh-huh. Oh yea no doubt about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=300

Is there any place that has better cheesecake, seriously? I've recently rediscovered this place for it's Happy Hour ""Bar Menu"". They have a TON of options to choose from and they are all 5 bucks!! Not only do you have a lot of options but the food is REALLY good and there is a LOT of it. Win win in my book! The cocktails are a little on the expensive side though. So if you are looking for a cheap night I would recommend just eating here and drinking elsewhere. But the drinks are good so I'd have to recommend at least getting one.

Jessica H.,"Hyde Park, MA",313,300,1194,3.0,1/28/2010,"We went there last night for dinner before catching a play at the Huntington Theatre. The wait wasn't too bad - our friend got there before us but they wouldn't seat her until we arrived. So we put our names in right away and I think the wait was only about 5-10 minutes. This place is huge and so popular even for a Wednesday night!  We ordered drinks - I got the pomegranate mojito, very very good! It's a little cheaper then a regular mojito too (maybe less alcohol since the pomegranate takes up room?) I def recommend that drink. Not many people can make a good mojito but they did a great job.  For such a huge menu The Cheesecake is unfortunately a big disappointment for any vegan. Luckily I had been there this summer with my dad in Virginia so I was already acquainted with the menu, Otherwise I would have been lost. Unfortunately most things contain eggs, butter, fish sauce, beef broth, cheese, etc. Supposedly all their pastas and breads contain egg so beware.  However I ordered the same thing I got this past summer and that was the Thai lettuce wrap. You can easily replace the chicken with portobello strips, asparagus, or avocado. They are very willing to do this and don't charge you that extra ""replacement"" tax that a lot of other places do. The wraps are delish - you get 3 different sauces and lots of good toppings to put in them. So the dish was great, exactly what I remembered.  I just wish they would have more vegan options - esp with some veg protein dishes (vegetarian beans, tofu, nuts, etc.)   My meal was great but I was definitely hungry a few hours later! The service was pretty good, the waiter was a little slow at times and we had to flag him down, but otherwise very friendly and a great atmosphere.

Here's why I loved it: 1. They gave me two delicious half-loaves of bread in the beginning of my meal.  2. My waiter was handsome. 3. They piled on the cheese (I got the California Omelet-- I think there were 4 DIFFERENT kinds of cheeses). 4. The ambiance in the room was so fancy, I felt like a duchess. 5. The cheesecake! My only complaints: 1. They only gave me 3 pads of butter for a whole loaf of bread. 2. There was no butter on the toast that came with my omelet. 3. I could not understand my waiter. (But he was extremely handsome...) I would like now to describe what I ate to y'all. Here it goes: California Omelet: This was a cheese-y vegetarian de-light. It was certainly scrumptious. The omelet was fluffy and came with a bunch of fresh vegetables, sour cream, avocado, and 4 cheeses baked inside. I thought that the presentation was real nice, and the taste was de-vine. Then, I had the option of potatoes or tomatos on the side and I chose potatoes. They were a bit crispy; seemed a little over-cooked to me, but the seasonings were good. Over all, though, I've had better potatoes. The toast that came with it was dry and not buttered, so I did not eat it. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake: This cheesecake was the best I've ever had. That's why I gave this restaurant 4 stars. I didn't think it deserved it until I ate some of the cake! It came with whipped cream and some chocolate sauce on the plate. Each bite was like fireworks in my mouth/throat. I tell you, I haven't felt as good as I did while eating that cheesecake in YEARS. If you are ever in Boston, you should definitely stop in to this one-of-a-kind restaurant, if not just for the cheesecake! God bless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=300
Peter W.,"Boston, MA",29,37,6,3.0,1/14/2010,"I'm not really sure how I feel about this place. Every time I go it is kind of the same thing. It is right across the street from my office so it tends to be a lunch place for my coworkers and me. The portions are large, the food is decent although sometimes it is salted to death and I like salt. The service is hit or miss depending on who you get. Seems like there is a very high turn over with wait staff I rarely see the same people aside from the hostesses. The cheesecake is pretty good stuff though, and there are lots of different combinations. I haven't counted but I'd guess around 20 something flavors.  I've seen the lines on my way home for dinner at this place and I think you are probably better going somewhere else in the area. That or call ahead they take reservations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=300
Katyusha K.,"Laredo, TX",2,30,,4.0,5/19/2011,"I like the CF for the free bread, the good Cheesecake, and the hefty portions. I come to the CF more often than I should. I celebrate almost every occassion here. I've never had much to complain about other than the occassional bad waiter/waitress or the waitstaff forgetting to refill my drink.  I went earlier this week and had a bill of $21.24. I paid in cash and change. I was told by the waitress to take my change back as she did not want the 24 pennies to jingle in her pocket. IMO the waitress should have just taken the pennies and used it as change for other customers that paid in cash or just not made such a big deal about it. She had the audacity to ask ""You don't have a quarter?"" and to say ""Oh, no tip?"". I always leave tip unless I've had bad service - she provided decent service other than not refilling the drink until I was practically done with my meal. I was going to leave tip but she called me out on it just because I did not put $25 rather than exactly $21.24. I try to be exact w/ the bill b/c I have had previous waitstaff pocket the change which has ranged from $4 - $10. I don't order expensive meals that would require such a large tip so that is why I pay in exact change so that the waitstaff does not ""run off"" with my change as tip. To make it short, this waitress completely embarassed me by hassling me for a quarter and telling me to keep my change and then immediately asking about her tip. All she served was an appetizer and a dessert it is not like she has to hassle me for a tip of a party of 10 or something. It's ridiculous. I also went to the CF at this location for 5 de mayo. I had a waiter who was completely incompetent and rude. I was waiting for someone else to join me and he kept bugging me to order despite that I had only been waiting 10 minutes for my guest to join me. He did not bring out my guests Sam Adam's beer. When we reminded him about the beer he brought out the wrong one in the wrong glass. He took the bread away even though we were still eating it. He hurried us with the bill. Point blank: I am definitely going to think twice before heading to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=300

Alvin C.,"Cambridge, MA",684,75,22,5.0,12/23/2010,"So anyone who knows me knows that I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory.  I used to live in the Greenhouse directly across the street. If I was yelping for those 3 years I would have averaged about 3-5 check-ins a week. I digress... I could list a number of great entree's but the fact is there is something for everyone.  The same goes for their cheesecake (unless you don't like cheesecake).  I have had just about all of them over the years and have not had a bad one, while I do have some favorites. The portions are huge.  You will probably take some home, or waddle out of there.  the mixed drinks are fun as well.  The only downside is there will be a late if you go at the classic dinner times or holidays.  Still it is worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=320

The staff is rude and the food almost always comes out cold. I once got something to go that I have had probably about 100 times before and it was made with incorrect ingredients. I confronted the counter staff and the woman told me I was full of it and if I didn't want it I should leave it.

Alisa K.,"Cambridge, MA",324,229,71,3.0,9/14/2012,"As far as chains go, this place is solid. You can refer to Atul Gawande's New Yorker piece for some of the specifics (and how the healthcare industry could take some pointers from it). Really like their bread (love that it's warm) and their pasta (had the spicy chipotle chicken pasta minus the chicken).  The BBQ salmon was tender and not overdone.  Tuna carpaccio was tasty and well-dressed.  Shrimp jambalaya was good if you like shrimp (I don't). The servers were prompt and industrious though a little awkward.  Particularly liked the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake. My only complaint is that a lot of the dishes were dressed with extraneous fried onions or what I can only describe as julienned tortilla chips.  Oh, and I've had garlic breath since last night and I can't for the life of me figure out what I ate that had garlic in it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=320
Ross G.,"San Diego, CA",25,131,5,2.0,12/3/2012,"Possibly the worst service ever. The girl took 20 minutes at least to check on us, the place was packed. This place needs to focus less on getting as many people in and out the door as possible, and focus more on quality. My friend's food was barely cooked, and had to be sent back. Which took an addition 25 min at least. Did i mention we waited 25 min before we were even given a table? Oh? have I got your attention now? Don't go here. Go to PF Chang's, legal or anywhere else in the malls. It's a shame too because the food is decent, as well as the desserts.

Kimberly H.,"Lincoln, RI",11,158,8,1.0,5/29/2012,"I had a new hire lunch here during my first week at my new company. All I wanted was just a large garden salad, without crutons/cheese- I knew my options were limited because I am vegan and have a gluten allergy. The first time i went there I asked if the balsamic dressing was vegan- I was told by wait staff that it was and trusted them as I thought they knew what they were talking about. The next time I went I asked about the dressing again, which were gluten free and vegan. They have no gluten free/vegan dressings- how could that even be with that large of a menu? Come to find out the waiter told me the balsamic dressing has honey in it- the waiter from the previous time told me it did not. It would be helpful for people with food allergies to have a seperate menu like other chain resturants do- bertuccis, not your average joes, burtons- these all have way smaller menus but offer way more information at the location for everyone's knowledge instead of having to rely on the staff.

Chrissie S.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",2,5,3,4.0,9/1/2009,"CF is awesome. Everyone knows it. Portions are HUGE (good enough to make two meals out of one) and tons of things to choose from. I used to primarily stick to the pasta dishes, being a pasta connoisseur but I have to say that I've discovered a new, probably often over-looked, dish that is definitely worth mentioning. The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (pg.11 of the menu). It's a perfect mix of american-ized thai and goodness. It's chicken and shrimp, in a mild-ish curry sauce with coconut milk and veggies, with tons of rice. A great summer meal! Also if you're in the mood for something a little more italian...try the Chicken Belliagio. It's on the new special supplement menu... it's all sorts of goodness...lightly breaded chicken on top of spaghetti with basil/pesto sauce, drizzled with Parmesan sauce and thin slices of prosciutto to top it off.

Jennifer K.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,57,89,3.0,11/3/2012,"Let me first say that I've been to many different locations of Cheesecake Factory, and I think this is the worst one I've been to so far. We had a fairly large party, so we tried to make a reservation, but I guess they don't do that? Since we were there on a Saturday night, we ended up waiting a very long time and splitting our party into several different tables in different sections of the restaurant. Also, this is the most crowded I've ever seen a Cheesecake Factory--ridiculous.  Anyway, our waiter was actually really awesome, patient, and quick, which is why I didn't give them 2 stars. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which I have had at several other locations and normally love. Tonight, however, it was super salty and there was a huge sprinkling (more like dumping) of cheese in the middle, which was odd because I've never had cheese in this dish unless I specifically asked for it. Overall, it made it salty and greasy, and unappetizing. The cheesecakes were pretty standard for CF, though, so at least that was comforting. Bottom line? There are so many other great places to eat nearby, so skip this Cheesecake Factory unless perhaps you come for lunch on a random weekday or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=320

My friend ordered our cocktails which were huge, fruity daiquiris. Mine was way to sweet and I couldn't even finish it; the libation was that huge.  Side note: EUROPEANS, especially Brits, LOVE the Cheesecake Factory.

Forgive me, foodies, but the four stars are for exactly that: the Cheesecake Factory does in fact specialize in doing everything.  They're a big location in a busy area that corners hotels, the ballpark, Northeastern, and Berklee.  They are exactly what's demanded of them: a place where you can take just about anybody, anytime, and get them something that they'll enjoy.  Next time you're complaining about how your burrito isn't ""authentic,"" look across the table from you.  Is someone eating a cheeseburger?  Or a pizza?  If so, you're the fool for expecting any of them to be some sort of ""specialty"" item.   This is a mega-raunt, and let's be honest, they do it well.  Everything tastes GOOD -- maybe it's not great, maybe it's not unique or exceptional, but it all tastes good.  If I can have good fettucini alfredo while you have good Cuban and your mom has a good shepherd's pie, you've gotta appreciate that.  They also don't cheat anyone even a little bit on the portions: you're going to get a dinner that will fill you. It's sort of ""cool"" to turn your nose up at the Cheesecake Factory, but they're laughing all the way to the bank.  They do what they do, and they do it well.  How could anyone be confused as to what this place is all about?  If they're not meeting your expectations...

I wear instead of giving me just two normal sized slices of bread, they gave me the entire loaf and slapped some cheese on it. And butter. Massive amounts of butter. There is just no need for the portions to be so huge, and it's not like they are good left overs. The food isn't even that good when you're eating it there.  I'm not a huge fan of any of the cheesecake options. It's all very rich and takes days to get through. They do have a chocolate cake that I don't mind spending a couple of days working on, but that's about it. Everything else is just way too rich, too much, and too expensive. I can understand this place being your favorite if it's the only place in town, but when you're in a city there is really no need to go there.

A test where The Cheesecake Factory promises to throw everything that's bad about chain restaurants at you, and dares you not to leave.  It looks like a casino: all gilded up, with giant columns everywhere, like some Mount Olympus of crapitude. But it's dark, insidious horror runs far deeper than the decor.  There is simply no way that any sentient human can endure, let alone enjoy eating at this place.  The menu is a sprawling, Dickensian monstrosity filled with twisted Epcot versions of the world's cuisine. There's Italian, Tex-mex, and, inexplicably, Goulash. There's even vaguely Asian things, which seem to have sprung  from some focus group where the question was: ""Name a foreign food you've heard of."" And it's all really, really, really bad.

My theory is that if you are a real cheesecake lover, you won't like the cheesecake here. But if you are like me (i don't really like the strong taste of cheesecakes), Cheesecake Factory might just be the place for you. So far, I have had the Godiva cheesecake (heavenly), Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake. It is so creamy and decadent, it makes me want to cry. The main dishes are great as well. I had the Margarita pizettes, BBQ pulled pork burger and portabello mushroom burger. While I really love all of them, I have to warn you that the caloric intake of these food is really high, even with the portabello mushroom (yes i checked it online). That aside, I love how juicy the portabello mushroom is as you take a bite into it. The buttery goodness on the lightly toasted bun complements the juicy mushroom. The BBQ pulled pork is also great, soft and juicy, just done the right way, not too salty.

I placed my order on   roughly an hour before I normally eat dinner and by the time my meal showed up (about 45 minutes) I was ready for some delicious food.  Let me start by saying that the Roadside Sliders are incredible. Rarely will I order something as conventional as a cheeseburger when I order from a restaurant that has a ton more to offer, but after the first bite I was completely hooked. They're basically mini-burgers that you can finish in about 4 or 5 bites (1 or 2 if you're REALLY hungry). They were so flavorful I had to order another batch the following week. Top it off with a slice of Peanut Butter Cheesecake and you'll be one happy customer. An excellent choice for any occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=400
Andy H.,"Boston, MA",0,25,,4.0,8/8/2011,"I live nearby, so I've been to this CF multiple times, and have had a variety of experiences.  To start, my parents love this place, and when they are in town they usually stay in the Colonnade Hotel, which has some sort of reservation system set up with the place? Either way, when I eat there with my parents, the food is always great and I always leave full. I've had the Mahi Mediterranean (probably my favorite) as well as the Hibachi Steak and the Steak Diane/Chicken Madeira combo, and I would highly recommend all of them.  Be advised: If you are a party of more than two, make a reservation! Or expect to wait at least 30 mins and closer to an hour to be seated. When I come with my girlfriend, as a party of two we are generally seated much faster than other parties. Also the service is exceptional, and they are very polite about asking for ID when you order drinks, some places I feel almost afraid to order a drink in anticipation of the inevitable ""ID please or you get nothing!"" statement from the server. Even though we are full, we always get a slice of cheesecake to go, its that good! I have also have some crappy experiences at this restaurant. For example, when you go with a larger party of mostly under 21's that have water and a burger, and all ask for separate checks, you are not going to be treated with the utmost kindness. Even though I almost don't blame him, our server rushed us through our order (there were 15 of us, and we had a reservation) We didn't get any bread, and were presented with our check(s) while we were still eating. It was pretty rude, we were only there 45 minutes at the most and the guy probably made 40 bucks off of us. which, being a server myself, is a good deal.

My main reason is the waiting time. This is like a 9 step process. First, put your name in. Wait 30 min for a buzzer. Then wait another 45 min for the buzzer to go off. When it finally does, you are ushered into a line of people STILL waiting to be seated.  I realize that Copley is a popular destination for tourists, professionals, suburbanites, students, etc...but when it takes longer to sit down than it does to actually eat my food, I have an issue.  The Cheesecake Factory is also not THE best place to eat if you have food allergies.  I think it really depends on the location, time of day, and server, because often I feel like it is too much effort to really make sure that my waiter understands all of the complexities that go into cooking for someone with celiac disease. I'd rather just order a salad, hold the bread and dressing, and say I have a wheat allergy.   I have read on some celiac message boards that at some locations, a manager or chef will sit down with you and pick whatever you want to eat...but at other locations, you'll be told ""we can't guarantee that ANYTHING can be made gluten-free.""  Thanks.  However, I am aware of a couple gluten-free desserts...the ice cream, goblet of strawberries (so simple, yet so delicious), and the Godiva cheesecake. Apparently there is no graham cracker crust...but I don't trust that it's not been contaminated by other cheesecakes in the bakery.  Despite the fact that I have my own hang-ups with Cheesecake, they do offer a huuuuge menu and decent service.

The portion is always double the American diner serving size. ;) One appetizer could even fill the hungry sromach enough.  I would recommend anything from their dinner salads and from breakfast menu, and some en trees are quite healthy and well-prepared, but, whenever I try pastas/noodles, they taste shallow and sugar-sweet most of the time. Compared to  Galleria Cambridge Side, Copley Mall branch is a better choice with better foods and  definitely well-trained waiters. What I like in this branch is : 1. friendly waiting (Beware! Cambridge Branch waiting is totally opposite, very slow and untrained, they never show up to refill your drinks) 2. convenient location 3. some good menu like Thai Lettuce wraps(appetizer) en trees have good selection of ingredients some of which can pass as a top restaurant dishes. 4. Sunday Brunch (till 2pm) is a nice surprise too, yum what I don't like is 1. accepting no reservations(waiting can be over 1 hour during some busy weekends) 2. not enough waiting/sitting space 60-90 min waiting for a dinner except the opening hours, 10 min waiting around noon time) 3. one annoying Asian hostess(I am Asian and I have never seen that cold attitude from any Asian folks-she works during the weekends-2006) ***update, she is still working there but she has improved her manners dealing with young and shy customers and I am just happy with their hosts nowadays-2007 4. big proportion means doggy bags always or more wasted breads and others, and often shallow flavors with the sauce. You will soon learn what to order to your pleasing taste. Will I go there again? absolutely, but I have to be careful of what to choose not to eat too much sugar.  The people are not too loud and show good demography of different races and levels. The waiting service at Copley Mall has consistently been superb. Always smiling.

Anna W.,"Chelsea, MA",48,274,2,3.0,10/30/2008,"I am a Cheesecake Factory whore. It's not on purpose though! It just so happens that wherever I am, at any given point in time, there is ALWAYS a Cheesecake Factory around. So, it's become ""old reliable."" I used to work at the CambridgeSide Galleria, and my co-workers and I would go there every Friday night after close to grab some drinks and food and bitch about how much we hated work. When I finally left that place, I was so happy I could finally end my Friday nights somewhere different.... but then I ended up getting a job at the Copley Mall and hence, another Cheesecake Factory!  The food is essentially the same at all of them. This one here almost always has a wait. I don't get what the big deal is, but whatever. Their food portions are OVERWHELMING. Much too big for a single person to eat. My friends and I normally get some appetizers and share, or a pasta dish, or split a sandwich. There are a few things on the menu that I always seem to fall back on: -- Sliders. With fries. Yummy. -- Avocado Eggrolls. I don't know what it is with me and avocados, but I love them. -- Thai Lettuce Wraps. A little sloppy to eat, and the sauce drips everywhere, but I like it. -- Pasta DaVinci. One of my favorite pasta dishes of all time. -- Steak Diane. Little nugglets of meaty goodness. And it comes with their yummy mashed potatoes. Can't go wrong there. -- Pumpkin Cheesecake. yes, it's seasonal. I believe they have it now, and it sticks around till after the New Year. Definitely worth a try if you've never had it. I don't even like the taste of pumpkin, but this cheesecake is to die for. I just wish they had it year-round. Service is pretty fast. I love the large glasses they use for soda. Even the glasses they use for alcoholic drinks is good. Ladies, if you are looking for a good alcoholic drink that is delicious and won't knock you over, try the Strawberry Creamsicle. It is by far the most delicious drink I've EVER had, and well.... I drink a lot :-) Don't go here for brunch though. Their brunch food sucks. You're much better off going to Thornton's, which is across the street.  I would never choose CF to go to for a special night or date, but it's one of those low-pressure places where you can just go chill with your friends, knowing exactly what to expect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=360

Mid-afternoon on a Monday you get seated right away, always a plus. Usually I go for the fish tacos, but today I tried the grilled eggplant sandwich. YUM! First, I should mention, it's so big and wonderful and cheesy that you can't really eat it like a sandwich. I had to cut it up and do the knife and fork thing, but I'm not complaining. The eggplant was very well seasoned. There was maybe a bit too much red onion but it was very easy to pick off. The roasted peppers and cheese were delicious as well but the best part by far was the garlic aioli butter on the bun. Oh my gosh that was exceptional.  My friend got a plain burger which was cooked perfectly. He was very happy considering our last attempt to get burgers (see my review of Whiskey's on Boylston).  The thing I like about this place is the amazing service. Our waiter was friendly and prompt, not overbearing while still being attentive.

MY FINDINGS: Americans like going to places that are already popular, they like big portions for their money and they like choice. Lots of it. MY VERDICT:  A sad long menu filled with the most mediocre, middle-of-the-road dishes from cuisines around the world. All committee-picked to be the least adventurous and inoffensive.

Ya know, shame, remorse, cultural conformity. *Pops collar, slips on crocs, reads bible* But what can I say? The food here is delicious. I don't know what they're doing in the kitchen (I imagine some sort of leprechaun is mixing potions and sacrificing lambs) but it seems like every item on the menu just makes me drool. The portions are gigantic so be prepared for that. My friend and I split a ""small"" salad from their appetizer menu and  neither of us could finish the plate. Together, we still only managed to eat about half (and by half I mean I shoveled the dressing, bacon, tomatoes, and bleu cheese crumbles into my pie hole and ignored the heads of lettuce that were cluttering up space for fatness). For dinner I ordered the chicken salad sandwich. It came with a salad, but since I had just attempted to eat a salad to start, I chose to replace my side with french fries (twist my arm). The sandwich was behemoth and oh so delicious. The fries were a bit too salty for my liking, but it's not like there was much room left in my stomach to eat them anyway. The helpful and attentive waiter wrapped up my unfinished sandwich and I was ready to pass out. Or vomit. Either or. But of course, the dessert menu came and we ordered a white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake to split (twists other arm). The cheesecake arrived with confetti sprinkles, mounds of whip cream, a birthday candle, and a herd of Cheesecake Factory waiters. SHIT. It's the night before my birthday. SHIT. I hate the birthday song. It makes me cringe, turn red, and want to crawl under a table and die. My friends know this. Do they care? No. So here it is, me, a cheesecake, and the herd. The song begins. I want to cry. But I see the dessert in the hands of my waiter Scott and I think, ""It will all be over soon."" *Singing ends, gathers up the rest of my dignity, spoons cheesecake into mouth....LIFE IS GOOD* This was my 2nd time ever to Cheesecake, and once again, I was not disappointed. The food is great, drinks are tasty, service is fantastic, and the high prices reflect that. Be prepared to wait since it's a popular dining spot, or linger into the bar area and stare some innocent people down until they hurry up and finish so you can grab their table. My only reasoning for 4 stars rather than 5 is their menu. It's too long and as my friend referred to it, it's like a magazine.

Victoria N.,"San Diego, CA",18,43,6,1.0,4/12/2009,"I seriously do not get the hype surrounding Cheesecake. What's the big deal?? Everyone goes here, for every occasion imaginable. Tourists who probably have Cheesecake back home come here. Whyyy?? You're in a new city, so explore the exciting dining options the city has to offer! So why did I find myself waiting over an hour for a table here? Because I happened to have a gift card--a prize for a cooking competition I won that was sponsored by the school. Long story short, we were told that there was no balance left on the card and that it was bought at a grocery store rather than at a location. They called the number on the back, and apparently the card was never scanned, pretty much implying that it had been stolen. They couldn't do anything without a receipt, so I ended up having to foot the bill when I would never even had gone in the first place if it weren't for the gift card. Yes, of course I know that this is not the fault of Cheesecake Factory. I just thought it'd be a good story to share. :} Although you can imagine how that just topped off our night of disappointment.... So the service wasn't bad, and they handled the above pretty well. But reviewers are on point when they mention the fake smiles and niceties of the people working there. When our waiter came by once, I said we were debating between these two appetizers, clearing expecting a recommendation, but he just waved us off with a 'I'll just give you more time.' Other than that, it was aight. On to the food/drinks...here is what we got in order of tastiness: - Pomegranate Mojito: tasty goodness, although lacking in alcohol for such a large glass. Price wasn't bad for what you get, though. - Beets with Goat Cheese (under their 'small plates' menu): description says 'fresh beets, apples, baby arugula, and pecans.' It was tasty, but maybe they're hinting at something by not putting goat cheese in the description...? - Strawberry Creamsicle: tasty like a shake, but again lacking in alcohol for such a large glass. - Bread: definitely better warm, as I've had in the past. - Fries: comparable to McDonald's fries. You can take that however you want to. - Sliders: thin pieces of meat not even formed into patties; obvious they were just scrapped together from a larger patty. - Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake: I swear the size of their cheesecake slices have gotten smaller over the years. So chocolate coconut cream sounded really good to me, but maybe I should've assumed there would be coconut flakes even if they weren't in the description. I love coconut and coconut flavor, but I hate those nasty little flakes. - The Navajo sandwich: we were debating between this and the sliders or just the beef ribs...boy do I wish we had gone with the beef ribs. I'm a sucker for variety though, and having two dishes instead of one somewhat appealed to me more at the time. The dry and tasteless chicken was the worst part, and the sandwich as a whole was really nothing special.  All in all, the food sucked. We should've just stuck with drinks and maybe another small plate. So we all know how long and inefficient their menu is, but I think the biggest annoyance was not having prices listed under the cocktail section. I had to pick out the ones I wanted so the waiter could ask the bar, and it's not like I'm going to do the same with each one until I found one with a suitable price... Maybe they should stop taking ads for their menu to make room for listing the prices for everything. Including the cheesecakes, since all they have now is a range of what it might be. I felt like I was flipping through a program booklet rather than a restaurant menu. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I just had two leftover sliders that were much tastier broiled with cheddar cheese, toasted bun-tops, and ketchup/fancy mustard, washed down with a glass of wine.

Their salads are HUGE and not that bad - but you can never finish all of it and I for one hate to eat leftover salad.. blegh. I've had chicken from here once and it was really rubbery, kind of reminded me of ""fake chicken"", it was just gross and chewy. The only things I like are the appetizers, really. And the chicken tacos aren't that bad. But when I walk out of here I just feel gross.. the food is so heavy and my body isn't used to eating like that.

We also ordered crispy crab bites for an opening. It was good, but I think six gum ball sized pieces were served. The waiter was extreme friendly. Second time, we ordered same thing but with the avocado rolls or whatever as an opening. My steak was burnt and the avocado rolls had no taste. The waiter wasn't so friendly either. Then third time, I came with a group of friends for a friends birthday. Two people ordered pasta from the lunch since we came during lunch time but the waiter gave us a dinner plate.

Igor K.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",0,11,6,1.0,6/15/2008,"I've been to Cheesecake several times previously, and overall, I found the food quite palatable, even pleasant at times. Not gourmet but come on it's a relatively inexpensive chain restaurant so what can you expect.  My last dining experience, however, has convinced me never to go back again.  Night started with them giving my girlfriend and I the wrong appetizer, which we promptly sent back. 10 minutes later we got the one we ordered. Unfortunately that was the highlight of our evening.  I proceeded to order a burger, medium rare (probably a mistake at CF, but hey, the waitress didn't say they couldn't make it so I assumed it was good to go) while my GF ordered their overpriced ""Jambalaya"" Pasta dish. Long story short, my burger came out extremely dry and well done. I sent it back politely, pointing out to the manager how dry and overdone the burger was. The next burger (which came about 10 minutes later, after my GF had essentially finished what she could choke down of her dry, flavor-lacking meal) appeared ok at first glance. However, after taking a few bites, I found it quite unpalatable, as the burger was essentially completely RAW in the middle. The meat really wasn't even warm.  I called the manager over again, and she once again apologized and asked me if I wanted to try something else on the menu, which I declined. She then mumbled something about ""Well, this is what happens when you rush food"" or something to that effect, which I thought was odd. She was apologetic, however and not really stand-offish, which is better than some other experiences I have had elsewhere.  For our trouble, we ended up getting a comped piece of some off-the-menu cheesecake (No choice of cake was offered to us for some reason?????) and not getting charged for the burger. I thought that we should have had the entire meal comped but didn't bother pressing the issue as I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible.  All in all, a terrible dining experience. I don't expect greatness when I go to a place like Cheesecake but I do expect at least borderline competence in the food, which I did not get this time around. If the cook is incapable of cooking a burger medium rare, they should politely tell you that they can only do medium as some other similar restaurants do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=500

To be fair, most of the big restaurants in the Pru also run a waitlist on the weekends, but the Cheesecake Factorys' seems to always be the longest wait. My advice? Have your dinner elsewhere, then stop by the Cheesecake Factory for dessert- pick up a slice at the counter, along with a big glass of milk, then take it upstairs, find a nice bench somewhere in the Concourse, and enjoy without the crowds.

Carol C.,"Jersey City, NJ",87,55,2,4.0,12/13/2006,"Dude. I freaking love THIS Cheesecake Factory.   Other ones I've been to (Cambridgeside Galleria, ones in Jersey) have been absolutely terrible!! Disgusting service, terrible food, dirty tables, you name it, they messed it up! But there is a light at the end of the Cheesecake Factory tunnel.  And that light is the CF on Hunt Ave.  I've been there about 2 dozen times over the past four years, and maybe 4 experiences have been bad.  For you mathies, 4/24 = 1/6 hits were bad.  The rest were great.  Let's do what I remember of the bad before we do the good. When it was bad: -A couple of times we requested a booth and didn't get it. This situation was remedied, but not without perhaps 10 minutes more of extra waiting time. 95% of the time they get it right. -Sometimes waiters/waitresses are just...crappy at best.  Maybe s/he has had a bad day, maybe s/he is just batshit crazy.  Bad waitstaff is the absolute exception; MOST waitstaff are friendly, informative, attentive, and nice!  On one particualry horrendous visit, we heard one particularly loud and waitress telling the table next to us that she'd be interested in a threesome.  Now, what you do in your personal sex life is none of my business, and frankly I just don't friggin care, but at your place of work is not the place to do it.  We really didn't want to hear this in the middle of our dinner, and it was just gross.  to hear it while she was shaking her loud (and misshapen, i might add haha) ass in front of us.  -They can screw up your order. I want to say 2 out of 5 times they have gotten something minute wrong. See the upside below. -The floors can be slippery. I can't understand this, its gotta be the oil from the kitchen, but yeah. Just be careful.   -The wait WILL SUCK on a weekend, most espcially in the evenings! Be prepared to wait anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours.  You've been warned!! -It can be loud! As all restaurants in Boston, there will be a larger population of college students, and obnoxious people in general.  Not that all college students are loud and obnoxious, but you know how we get when we're in groups stuffing our faces and drinking. We get messy. When it was good! -Friendly, attentive hostess waitstaff that got us everything we needed when or even before we needed it!  -They make amends when they mess up.  They overcooked my friend's burger, he got free dessert.  Its happened a few times.  I think they should get it right on the first shot, but what can you do? -I love their booths. -Everything you could and couldn't want on the massive menu. -The Cheesecake rocks! -I have never once been disappointed in their burgers. They have always been fresh, and over or undercooked they use the best meat I have ever tasted.  They have a variety of cheeses, mushrooms, etc for your picking..tell them to double check the cheese you want if they say they don't have it. Some days they have different ones than others. -Shrimp club was amazing, too. -Breakfast there isn't bad, I remember specifically my homefries were over done, but the omellette and toast were perfect. -I love their honey wheat bread. 80% of the time it is fresh, warm and delicious.  Not bad sourdough, but its not my cup of tea anyway. -My friend has always enjoyed their flavorful Passion Iced Tea.  Not a bad scotch selection either.  Bartenders have been known to be slightly heavy-handed on the alcohol, but hey, what are you drinking for then? (jk!) -They have a huge dessert menu, not just cheesecake! Its not that pricey, around $10 for appetizers, anywhere from $7-27 for entrees, $7 for a slice of cheesecake.  Huge portions, and you won't leave hungry.  Great for medium sized groups.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=480

Oleana B.,"Boston, MA",0,55,5,2.0,2/20/2013,"I always forget to never come here again. It's a pity because this place has nice sized portions and a great variety but everything is so bad. After a long consideration of the menu I got the burrito. When it arrived, it was the size of 3 normal ones. The size alone grossed me out. The sides it came with were OK. The baked beans, probably from a can were OK, so was the guacamole and the sour cream was fresh. The burrito was totally disgusting. It was filled with steamed rice, really old chicken that was reheated multiple times, what was supposed to be caramelized onions were just burned onions, they were actually black, specks of corn probably from a  can and specks of fried pepper which were OK. It felt like you were eating steamed rice and really old, dry and partially burned chicken. The cheese and salsa was on top of the tortilla instead of being inside, or at least the cheese being inside. I don't claim to be a burrito connoisseur but something felt seriously wrong with the burrito setup compared to what I am used to. Some of the salsa tasted like spoiled tomatoes. The whole dish literally swam in some kind of cheese sauce with green stuff in it. The waiters were nice, however we had to wait 15 minutes for a table and then when our buzzer rang, we had to wait again for a our name to be called to be seated. Another 5-10 minutes. When we came to the seating area there were a lot of open tables. This is my last time at this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=480

Portions are ginormous, to fit in with their ""BIG"" theme. Huge restaurant, huge menu, might as well go with huge portions. I can easily make another meal, if not 2, out of my leftovers.

I found the prices surprisingly reasonable.  I was expecting a lot of $16 dollar platters or something but there were a lot of reasonably priced tasty entrees availible.  I ended up getting  a bbq onion ring burger with fries.  For only 10.95 and the serving was large.  I ended up having leftovers, which I ended up not even eating.  The big whopper came with my drink however (a tasty raspberry lemonade).  I knew something was up when the prices for the drinks weren't listed on the menu.  But I figured hey, how much could it be.  When I got my bill, WHOA.  My drink was a whopping 5 bucks! $4.95 to be exact.  And yes while the serving was large and there are free refills, I still find that excessive when places like Applebee's have similar, great tasting drinks for half the price and free refills too.   All in all, a great place to go on a date or with friends.  The food is good, the prices are reasonable (minus the drinks and cheesecake..then again their cheesecake is amazing) and the ambiance makes for a great night out.  4 stars =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=460

That all changed when one night our server brought out my girlfriend's food cold. She mentioned that the pasta was cold, so the server said she'd go have them reheat it. Seems easy enough. She brought it back, and we asked her for some more water and some olive oil for the bread. What happened next baffled both of us. She turned to my girlfriend, who is black and had been making the requests, and said: ""Who do you think you are, you n****r b***h?"" Stop the presses. Needless to say we went and complained, and the manager of the restaurant started crying about it. They gave us the meal for free, which we had no intention of finishing, and offered us a variety of gift cards in various amounts, which as nice as it was, felt a lot like trying to buy some quiet out of us, especially as they raised the amounts each time we said no. I don't know what it was that caused our now-fired server to burst like that, as I don't think our requests were unreasonable, but whatever it was, neither of us want to go to a restaurant where servers hurl racial slurs and profanities at you.

Honestly it didn't look good but we tried to eat it anyways.. It tasted like it looked.. greasy. We also ordered fish tacos they fell apart upon arrival and neither of us could enjoy those either. The small plates and apps were awesome, chicken croquettes, stuffed mushrooms and onion rings, we reordered some to replace the dinner. The waiter ask if we wanted things wrapped up since the plates were full NO way we replied.

On top of the bad service, my dining companion's food came with hairs all over the side of the pasta dish - the server asked, annoyed, ""do you want me to take it back? It's just on the side, not the actual food, so I wouldn't send it back"" - so what are we supposed to say to that. Then, we noticed the chicken in the pasta was bright pink! Seriously? I couldn't believe it. We nicely pulled our server aside and explained the problem and he apologized, but no offer for a different dish, no offer to comp that dish. I've never gotten the check and ran out of a restaurant so quickly. My boyfriend, who had the chicken dish, felt sick the rest of the day. I'm just happy he wasn't more sick after eating that chicken. And all these problems for a $50 + tip meal? I won't be returning.

So I asked the group to look at the menu online so we could order right away. Alas, upon arrival I was told that the table would be set up. 15 minutes later it was. (What is the point of reserving then?)The waiter disappeared after the drink order and long story short, the lunch finally arrived 50 minutes after we did. So 2 of us with meetings had to ask the others to bring our salads back and had to leave without food. Of those who remained, one had the wrong salad altogether and had to wait again.

But still, this is a nice place to meet with friends for a reunion or something. That's usually what I end up coming for, which makes the long wait okay - time to catch up with one another's lives and wander the Pru.

Gabriella S.,"Quincy, MA",0,10,,2.0,8/12/2008,"In general, I actually like Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  The lunch specials are reasonably priced, the portions are generous, and there are enough options that everyone will find something they like.  However, I think I'm going to stop coming to this one because both the food quality and the service have been consistently bad. The main problem is the slow service.  The last time I came here, our lunch was stretched out for almost two hours because we had to wait so long for everything.  It was made worse by the fact that we had to ask, and then wait, for things servers normally bring automatically, like water refills, straws for our drinks (we had to ask twice) and sugar for the coffee.  My boyfriend asked for ketchup for his hamburger, and then had to wait so long that it was cold by the time he finally got to eat it.  We wanted dessert but by the time our server finally came to take our order, we really had to leave and do other things with our day.  We even had to wait to be seated, even though there were empty tables available.  Maybe they are understaffed? There are some smaller issues as well; for example, some tables are directly across from the kitchen, which at times can be so noisy you can't hear the conversation at your own table.  Also, the food is not as good as other locations.  My favorite is the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which I recently loved at the South Shore Plaza location.  At this one, it was served at room temperature and had less sauce, and tasted like it might have been sitting around for a while.  All in all, I'll find somewhere else to eat when I'm at the Prudential, and get my favorite Cheesecake Factory dishes elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=520

Pretty silly for food that's just slightly better than the other sodium-packed chains like applebees. Their legendary menu is glossy and has ads in it- which seems unjust given that I'm paying decent money for mediocre food just because of the location and because my little sister was just dying to take me here as I treated her for her birthday. There was a lot to choose from, and the portions were generous. When we mentioned it was her birthday they brought out their namesake dish- which honestly wasn't that great. I wouldn't go back here again, but with a cute interior and a huge menu I could see why this is a popular date spot for the college crowd because it feels more upscale than it really is and the price is enough that it feels like a special outing but not enough to bust the bank.

If you dont mind that then go for it-- or you could also take the leftovers home and feed yourself for another week. Also the place has a sort of ""chain restaurant"" feel to it, sort of impersonal. I know they try to make it an amazing experience and try to look classy and unique etc, but i think it's just unavoidable (maybe it's the ads in the menus).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=520
Felix L.,"Boston, MA",5,54,2,3.0,4/24/2007,"I think this place is generally over-hyped. Entrees are a bit pricey for what you get. The food is generally decent, never amazing... I guess the desserts are good, but I never want to stay any longer after i'm done with my meal (after spending 30+ min waiting for a table)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=520
Steve S.,"Boston, MA",1,99,,5.0,8/29/2005,"As good a meal as you can find in Boston and portions so big I've never finished it all in one sitting. The menu is incredible, both in its breadth and its quailty. From salads to steaks to appetizers to desserts, this place will have a delicious option for every eater. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of change because you won't want to miss out on their signature cheesecakes after you've had your entree. It's best to go during off-peak hours, unless you are prepared to wait a couple hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=520
Jill M.,"Punta Gorda, FL",4,36,,4.0,6/29/2005,"This restaurant is guaranteed to please.  They have the biggest menu I have ever seen in my life with absolutely everything.  There's something to please every tatse.  It's actually a bit overwhelming.  I spend 20 minutes looking at the menu, then I just give up and order the same thing every time.  My favorite item is the chinese chicken salad.  I'm not a cheesecake girl - but I hear it's pretty decent there.  Go figure!  The portions are enormous - so make sure your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach.  And expect a wait - it's pretty much always packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=520
Juliette V.,"Cambridge, MA",0,101,,4.0,7/12/2005,"Huge amounts of food and great quality for the money. I have never gotten anything I did not like. Their menu items range from copious salads to good old fashioned burgers to nicely seasoned buffallo wings. Plus, do not forget the signature item, cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-boston?start=520
