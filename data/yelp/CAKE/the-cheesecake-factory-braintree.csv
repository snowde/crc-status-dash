Qme Z.,"Boston, MA",244,93,40,3.0,5/30/2017,"I came here with a group of four for a late dinner Saturday night around 8 pm. As per usual the restaurant was packed. We were told the wait time would be approx 1-1.5 hours. Since we wanted dinner with drinks we decided to stay and wait. They give you a buzzer to let you know when your table is ready but the buzzer only has a radius of 10-15 feet, so we really couldn't go too far. We waited for about an hour and was seated. The table was still dirty from the party before with some clean plates and silverware on top. We requested the table to be cleaned and shortly after a bus boy showed up and wiped it off. The food and drinks were a little sub par from other Cheesecake Factory restaurants I've been to. It really wasn't worth the wait, but I'll be back for their cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=20
Jeremy P.,"Boston, MA",4,98,5,4.0,9/3/2017,"The best service is at the bar. Nachos appetizer melty to perfection. The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and the Sam Adams seasonal was fresh and ice cold! I've eaten here several times over the years and the food and service was just meh, 2.5-3 star experience.

Krys G.,"Stoughton, MA",35,269,392,4.0,2/28/2017,Go before the rush or you will wait forever. The menu is quite diverse and offers many items. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The salads were nice and cold and fresh.  We decided on the shrimp with angel hair pasta and the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. The dishes came out hot. The pasta was nicely cooked the way we like it. The portions were huge for us we couldn't even finish. We were kind of full but decided to split the Lemoncello Cream torte for dessert. It was fantastic!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=20
R S.,"Cambridge, MA",0,25,,1.0,4/28/2017,"We normally have great experiences at this particular location but our most recent experience soured every previous one. Our server Brittany was atrocious, she clearly dislikes her job and should not be in a service based industry. We won't be back.  I didn't even think it was possible but after giving this location another try we had the same abysmal service by the same server Dwyer?. To be honest it seemed that Brittany was more concerned with anything but taking care of her tables.

Kim N.,"Cambridge, MA",18,41,5,1.0,9/15/2017,"SO sad :( I've always considered Cheesecake Factory a ""go to"".  Tonight at the Braintree location may have ruined that for me.  I got my usual Tuscan Chicken off the the skinnylicious menu. It's usually bright and fresh with delicious asparagus.  Tonight's had 2 pathetic limo pieces, half the amount of chicken as I've had in the past at Cambridge, and covered in oil.  If I hadn't been starving I would have stopped after one bite but I ate about half and I feel absolutely disgusting after how greasy it was.  On top of my friends burger being over cooked and teeny tiny it was just an overall bad experience. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=20
Jen S.,"Brookline, MA",135,260,172,4.0,8/23/2016,"Still catching up on so many years' worth of reviews! So Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake factory- same menu, same taste everywhere. Same long waits for its expansive (slightly expensive), delicious menu. But I'm rating this place since we come here more often (proximity and all) The main thing I want to say is that this place has lovely staff and very kid friendly! They were always very nice to us when we wanted to bring our baby in his car seat- either by giving us a big booth to fit him with us or helping us secure him on one of their car seat holder things they have. On a busy day, one of the walkways between the restaurant and the mall are packed with parked strollers. :) They have a delightful brunch! Good brunchy/breakfasty items AND lunch/sandwich items to choose from.  Their small plates are really great if you have a small appetite but still want tasty food. Worth the price.  Their entrees are huge and possibly can be turned into leftovers for 2-3 meals :) Their sandwiches are VERY tasty and probably some of the more affordable items on the menu- and the perfect amount. Not too big, not too small.  Their desserts: I love their strawberry short cake. I guess they have cheesecakes too. :-P Kidding- oh there are SO many to choose from and they are all divine.  Oh and the BREAD! OH THE BREAD! The honey wheat bread is for the gods and goddesses. I typically ask them to only bring out that kind instead of their sourdough. They are generally nice to accommodate. If they forget because it's busy, I don't complain. I just make my husband eat the sourdough :) It's worth the wait. Sit outside if you can. Don't hesitate to bring your little one and don't worry about leaving your stroller out of your view.  Have your cheesecake and eat it too, even if you take it to go because the bread and entree stuffed you so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=20
Angel M.,"Manhattan, NY",211,188,217,5.0,2/29/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is the  !!! I didn't realize before how they have such a huge variety of actual good food!!!! I cant wait for my next cheat day!! Disclaimer: I came here 3 times within 8 days to ensure a perfect Yelp review :P Apps/Small Plates: Calamari and the Buffalo Blasts are my favorites so far. Initially, I thought the buffalo blasts were a little too salty/rich but I think they make the perfect shareable appetizer. Buffalo sauce, cheese, and chicken in a fried won-ton wrapper is actually the best thing ever. -Crispy Fried Cheese: only about $5.50, but so not worth it. Do yourself a favor and get the Fried Mac & Cheese instead. Entrees/sides: -Goat cheese & beet salad (I think its the French Country Salad) but that was the gist of it. It's pretty good. I'm trying to get myself to eat more beets, so this was an enjoyable way of doing so. It also had asparagus and candied pecans. -Fried Mac & Cheese: YUM! Need I say more?? If I had to, I'd only mention that the marinara sauce on top is so amazing. -Mac & cheese: the sharp cheddar taste was strong (if you're into that). When I had the leftovers the next day, it was extremely oily??? But once I poured out the 1/2 cup of grease, it actually tasted really good. Drinks: I had the Georgia peach (sweet & frozen), the House Merlot (very good) and The blue Long Island Iced Tea. All very good choices. Desserts: -Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake: YUM -Salted Caramel Cheesecake: DOUBLE YUM -Dutch Caramel Apple Streusel: YUMMY!! (this isn't a legit ranking. Caramel + cheesecake is always a win for me so these fun variations were amazing). There are so many other things to try!! That is what makes it a 5 star experience. The wait is the only con with this restaurant. Plan early and make sure there is that one person in the group that is willing to wait for the table while the others are running late! They're cool about letting you sit, even if the others aren't there yet. You can also order drinks at the bar while you wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=20

Cathleen R.,"Milton, MA",0,11,6,3.0,9/27/2017,"Ehh...it's a busy chain, so you shouldn't go in with super high expectations. I was seated the other night when it was very quiet (host said ""I'll find a place to put you""... looked around for a bit, plenty of empty seats, then brought us over) and had to wait quite some time for a server to come over. She apologized for the wait, no problem. The rest of the night, however, the service was subpar. The waitress was impossible to find unless dropping off the food and hurrying away, didn't offer or give us bread, and had a very bored personality. I felt rushed and uncomfortable. Mind you I entered an hour before close, so it wasn't late enough to be rude to the staff! I was irritated when I left but not enough to keep me from coming back. Just know you're not signing up for a 5 star experience when you go here...especially with disinterested, unpersonable staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=20
Heidi L.,"Dennis, MA",1,12,,2.0,9/24/2017,"Extremely slow and inattentive service. Disappointing.  My daughter's 12th bday. Everyone from the hostesses to the waitress lacked any sense of urgency with serving.  Table of five, appetizers, five entrees served randomly by four different people-- took THREE hours.  I'm sitting here still waiting for the check. :(  Update:  I noticed that the Cheesecake Factory customer service people commented back, apologizing and assuming I didn't bring up my concerns while I was still there.  I did-- more than once, to two different servers bringing our food (randomly) and also to another employee passing by while that I begged to find our bill so we could finally leave after so many hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=20

Heather P.,"Rockland, MA",85,74,,5.0,11/23/2016,"I am always satisfied with this restaurant. I have made it known to all my loved ones that I have tried every single flavor of Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake. Every single flavor, including seasonal ones. I have mentioned to the waiter once that there should be some kind of award for a person who tries every one. Perhaps a punchcard and with every slice a punch is given...in the end perhaps a free cheesake? He agreed, but...yeah nothing happened with that. Anyway! Haha. I loved every meal I ever got-alwasy tasty and perfect. I have quite the appetite but almost always have an extra meal waiting for me in the fridge due to their huge portions that turn into leftovers. (Nothing like opening the fridge the next day to see those wonderful leftovers for lunch!)  The decor, the waitstaff, the book (menu) of options for meals which is really a book. The prices, the portions, the delcious cheescake...I could go on and on. Even the wait is not that bad for a crowded Saturday night. Plenty of parking, and you have thre Southshore plaza attached.  Will have to check in again soon to see if any new flavors have developed......:-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=20
Alanna S.,"Sharon, MA",235,4,,1.0,11/19/2017,"I am very disappointed with my latest experience. I usually love Cheesecake Factory, so earlier today I went to get takeout to bring to a party I was attending later. I ordered 3 spinach and artichoke dips. It took 30 minutes for them to have it ready, which was long but understandable because they were busy. After walking out with my takeout I did check to make sure they were all there. To my dismay, it was crab dip and not the spinach dip I had ordered. I went back inside and told the worker who had given me my order that it was the wrong dip, and I really could not wait another 30 minutes to get the right order. The woman said she would give me a refund, but she needed to get a manager first. 5-10 minutes later a manager finally comes over. The worker told the manager, ""They ordered crab dip, but really wanted spinach dip so now they want a refund"". No mention that it was in fact her that actually messed up the order. The manager punched in her authorization code for the refund and walked away. No apology. The worker then told us the refund would be issued in 2 days. We walked out 45 minutes later empty handed. Not once did someone say how sorry they were for the mixup. I understand that things like this happen, but I expected some sort of apology. Instead the workers and manger were rude. I sadly do not think I will ever be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=20
Julie M.,"Weymouth, MA",58,157,123,4.0,12/4/2017,"I just really cant get over how dark it is in this restaurant. I like intimate ambiance and all but it is just so dark you can hardly see where you're going let alone the menu.  The avocado spring rolls are out of this world. The outside is fried perfectly to give you that crunch, and then you have good chunks of avocado inside with other spices. The dipping sauce looked green in color and had a sweetness to it. I think last time i ordered them there was a creamy sauce where as this one was more of a liquid sauce. Whatever the sauce was it paired perfectly with the rolls.  I was impressed that the butter that comes with the rolls was not in packets but instead one large pad on a saucer.  The pasta carbonara with chicken, ringing up to a $20.50 price, was well over priced for the portion size you get. I normally am able to get a few meals out of the one dish but not today. The meal was delicious i cant deny that, with the exception of a few cartilage pieces in the chicken, the garlic Parmesan sauce is very flavorful over the spaghetti and i loved the peas and bacon bits. Last but not least, the cheesecake. Holy moly the Chocolate moose cheesecake is like silk in your mouth. It is so smooth and light with just the right chocolate-y-ness. So so so good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree
Laura M.,"Boston, MA",9,14,3,1.0,12/23/2017,"We had an awful experience here last night as a large group dining for a birthday between 6:20 - 7:45pm. We had two servers assigned to our two tables. My review is for the server assigned to our table who was short in stature with brown hair (cannot remember her name). My husband ordered a filet mignon. Our sever brought him a ribeye and told him it was a filet! Yes, you read that right. Our waitress did not know the difference between a ribeye and a filet. She then quickly left before we could protest further.  The ribeye steak tasted like it was rolled in salt before it was cooked and was inedible. The mac and cheese tasted like the boxed Velveeta from our youth. My steak tacos were fine, but very small and nothing spectacular.  Ten minutes later she returns, says she was wrong and that she will give him the inedible ribeye for free. My husband rightly rejected her offer (a ribeye is a very different cut from a filet) and requested a filet. She said it would take a long time to come out, and he still said that was fine. 30 minutes later - everyone else is done eating, his filet comes out undercooked!! It was bright red throughout and not even close to medium well. I'm not sure how it took 30 minutes to undercook a steak. He sends it back.  When it returns 10 minutes later, he is so frustrated he asks for a to go box. We ask for the bill. Here's where the fun begins folks... Waitress charged us for 2 filets and only refunded 1! She said she would not refund the 2nd one because we ordered it after she said she would give us a free ribeye. First, that is not a proper accommodation. A ribeye is not a substitute for a filet. Second, we should not be paying for the restaurant's numerous mistakes regarding the type of steak and the requested preparation.  I slept on it and realized this was actually ridiculous and we should not have paid. We should have asked for a manager and pressed the issue. I am leaving this review so others are aware of the poor service we received and the subpar food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree
chelsea h.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",133,177,8,3.0,9/16/2017,"I'm not a chain lover, but I come here from time to time before going across the street to the movies out of ease.  Last night was ok, nothing special- just as I expected. I just want to say that we didn't love our experience because our waitress was a dud, had zero personality, and forgot to give us bread before our meal. Although, we watched her give some to all the tables around us. She wasn't very polite and seemed irritated when we were trying to figure out what we wanted to eat, and bothered whenever we asked for a drink. Once our food came we never saw her again until the check came. But, like I said- this isn't much different than I would have expected from this place. I'll go again, and expect an ok experience.... hopefully next time I'll get a waitress who at least knows how to smile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree

I sat at the bar and there was one couple who had just finished their meals sitting at the end. I ordered a beer (Sam adams because they didn't have Stella draft) and was asked if I wanted the delicious bread that usually comes with while you wait for the meal. I got my beer and waited for the bread. Another couple sat next to me a few minutes later, ordered their meal, and received their bread right away. I looked around to see if my bread was coming, looked at the bar tender and said; I guess I'm not getting any bread tonight. He looked at me and said he would look into it, but at that point my Louisiana Chicken Pasta dinner had already come out. I was really looking forward to drinking my beer with the bread, however that never happened. My meal was ok, but was never offered an apology for the bread, so I asked for the bartender to comp my half drank beer ( I wasn't feeling the Sam Admas).

Our server, Eunize, was very sweet and attentive. We ordered an appetizer Caesar salad and buffalo blast to share between three. We sent back to buffalo blast because they were full of batter and tasted different than our party remembers them being months back. Taking it off the bill was not a problem which is appreciated because some places try to make you order something else. My sister ordered the chicken chipotle pasta which is her favorite, hold the peas and crunchy topping but add extra sauce.

He even gave me some future drink ideas.  I can't speak for the restaurant service as a whole but if you're in the area and looking for somewhere to grab a quick drink i would recommend here. There are many options in the area but lets be real Legal Seafood is just good for their food. They couldnt make a Mai Tai if their name depended on it.

Barbara K.,"Boston, MA",160,72,157,4.0,8/22/2017,"This particular location holds up to any other Cheesecake I have eaten at. We came here on a Tuesday night, we had a party of five and we had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated, it was surprising but to be expected at Cheesecake I suppose. We had a wonderful waitress, I thought I made a note of her name but turns out, I did not. If you haven't eaten at the Cheesecake, it's definitely a pretty solid restaurant. Their menu is huge and has something for everyone in any mood. We had an order of spicy chicken nachos to split, they went very quickly.  I went with a staple of mine, the Four Cheese Pasta with chicken, which was delicious. I also recommend their lemonade, it's just like drinking liquid lemony sugar and it's fantastic. Everyone in my party had been to a Cheesecake Factory before and ordered their favorites and everyone was happy.

I've always had great food and service but these were lacking.  First off, waited unusually long for beverages and had to ask for bread. My son ordered cheeseburger sliders which he got with no cheese. He decided to eat them and they were overcooked and just gross. My other son ordered a regular cheeseburger (medium) and it was just charred! We sent it back and the waitress said the cook was making another one and it would take time. (like it was our fault it needed to go back) She brought out the second one. Minus Fries (they couldn't throw a few more on the plate so my son could eat a couple hot ones with his burger?) This one was charred as well Neither boy ate much of his sandwich and waitress made no notice of it. She should of asked what was wrong.  Very disappointed!

We asked for straws and she said ok and again walked away. After the 4th time asking we finally went to the bar to get our own. When it came time for the bill, we waited 15 min for her to wrap our food up (and by wrap I mean throw it into a box messily). Waiting for change took over a half hour. When we asked to talk to a manager she was also very rude and didn't apologize about the service. She just said ""I'll go find her"". The waitress came back over with our money still in her pocket saying ""you needed something?"". I understood it was busy, so we went to give it another try and got a latte that we had ordered the night before. The cashier rang it in as the wrong drink. We said that to the women who made them and she ordered to remake it, we said it was ok and she went back to work. We tasted the drink and it was gross so we asked her if she would mind remaking it and she said it's made the same way and refused to make it over again even though she just offered a min ago.

After siting there for maybe 15 minutes or even more the waiter came to take our food and drink order all at once. I had a question about the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta and if I could have it without mushrooms to which he said yes. Well over a half hour later he came back to let me know that it was in the sauce. So then I had to make another decision and went with the eggplant Parmesan. Everyone else's food came out and after I waited while everyone else ate my food finally came out. The eggplant tasted like it was covered in pepper. It was so gross I only ate my pasta. I should of just skipped eating all together as I waited long enough. I do not think I will return to this location ever again. The waiter should know the menu and if not ask the kitchen. I also should add to the fact that the table I sat at had huge cracks all over and it was very sharp where the cracks were because they are granite. The floor was also very dirty as well.

Joshua D.,"Boston, MA",0,1,,1.0,11/6/2016,"I have been to this Cheesecake location about 6-7 times. And every single time my wife and I have been disappointed. You might ask why would you return after a bad dining experience? Well we really like the Cheesecake Restaurant Chain, we have gone to the one in Back Bay, Burlington, North Shore, Providence Place, and all have excellent food and great service (Providence have hiccups in service and waiting here and there). So after a bad experience we seem to convince ourselves again to forget the past and give it a new shot. But after our last experience I don't think we will be dining there ever again. We have had all sort of issues at this location. From our waiter forgetting the bread, to our waiter forgetting about us completely. On our second visit we were sat and ordered our food, and it took about an hour and a half for it to arrive, it was 4 PM by the way. Cold food Check, forgetting drinks check, waiter never checking back after food arrives check. Another visit I had was when I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken, and the dish came impossibly salty (I asked them to try it and take it back). And in our most recent and last visit our fried calamari plate came to our table looking like a mess, like it had just been dropped on the floor and quickly put back on to the plate (I knew this because the cocktail sauce was everywhere). Cheesecake is our favorite restaurant and I had to be disappointed, but if you plan on going to cheesecake go to another location, and if you still come to this one, don't judge cheesecake as a whole based on this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=100

Kimberly B.,"Fort Myers, FL",89,27,6,5.0,5/22/2015,"My roommate and I chose to go to this spot after seeing the copious amount of vegan options they had on the menu. (well vegetarian, but you can make them vegan). We sat at a high top table at the bar because the wait looked long for a dining table. Boy did we have the right idea! We had the best service I have received in a very long time. Our waitress, SamL caught us off guard welcoming us in the most bubbly of manors. We had a few questions about the menu, as my friend cannot eat any dairy or meat. Sam knew the entire menu (and that says something for a menu that's multiple pages long). We were able to get two very tasty dishes! As far as food goes! I ordered the mac and cheese balls for an appetizer, and Kayla ordered sweet potato fries. When I say melt in your mouth cheese balls...I mean it. The sweet potato fries are satisfyingly crispy as well! By the time our entrees came we were too full to even eat half!

Thomas W.,"Roslindale, MA",23,11,6,1.0,10/8/2014,"Let me start this by saying that Cheesecake Factory restaurants, overall, are great locations for eating out. The granite Abe south shore plaza location is a growing FAILURE. From management to the chefs, this location struggles on a regular basis. Case in point- I ordered a Louisiana Chicken Pasta to go from the location. I arrived and waited for the order outside. After several minutes I finally decided to just go in and get it. The server told me they were bringing it out from the kitchen that moment. I went home. What I received looked as if it had been microwaved several times over. The chicken was hard and near plastic- it just wasn't edible . Clearly they had not just cooked this but decided to throw this in the warmer and, with no care, just shove it out to me. I noticed this terrible meal, called the restaurant and received a ""manager""... He told me they would send a gift card in the mail... LIES- nothing came (after a week) an I called back to the restaurant to deal with the matter. I was told they did not have a manager by that name and that I would have to come back in again to deal with it. I reordered the same meal and THEY DID IT AGAIN- same disgusting rewarmed leftover from someone else's plate.  The manager was immediately contCted and told he would remake it and it would be to my liking. I took that THIRD plate of the same meal home... What do you think happened- THE SAME DISGUSTING LEFTOVER REWARMED GARBABGE.  So, I would suggest going to cheesecake and utterly avoiding the braintree south shore location.... They can't get it right. Don't believe me - take a peek at the pics of this terrible meal.  By the way, I wish yelp allowed for 1/2 stars.

Kemi A.,"Portland, OR",131,654,34,4.0,2/15/2012,"What can I say about the Cheesecake Factory that hasn't been said before? There's a reason why this is a cult favorite among family, friends, and coworkers. The Cheesecake Factory is simply the shit.  It's important that you have reservations, otherwise you'll be noshing on the cheesecake on display before you are given a table. The staff are very friendly and polished, so it makes you feel like you're at a very posh place. The menu is extensive, I'm not kidding it's as thick as a Bible! Do yourself a favor and check online before you go in. The CF does a good job with variety, but if you're looking for something halfway healthy, GTFO. There's also options for vegetarians/vegans, but not so much. Always ask your server before you order.  I was there on a business lunch, and the food was delicious! We started with stuffed mushrooms, eggplant rolls, and popcorn shrimp as appetizers. Then I had the seared salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus--yum! That and with a strawberry lemonade drink made my life complete.  After stuffing yourself with 2308345893485 calories, you have to have cheesecake!! What kind? Well when I looked it was over 40+ of them. I had the Pecan cheesecake which was to die for, good luck trying to eat it all after that big meal!

My 3 stars, I'm sure would not make or break them...they're popular n always crowded. Please keep in mind that I have always been a fan since this chain opened up its 1st at The Atrium, chestnut hills. Like most chain restaurants (Maggiano's), they tend to change up things n stupidities took over. My reviews: Pro's. .. fave item...my passionfruit ice tea. -The  honey wheat brown loaf..still ok -Spaghetti n Meatball w/Italian Sausage Sauce...a new item. Yum...must try if craving for this all-time comfort food. Tasty sauce meatballs...not as heavy as expected. The fresh basils added a special touch. -Mini bite menu: Zucchini, Avocado,  Mushroom Frites. Crispy not greasy...accompanied w/2 kinds of sauces...only liked 1 of the 2. Cons: -Tex Mex Egg Rolls...more salty than usual! They did away w/their usual green sauce n replaced it w/some watered-down sour cream and a splash of red something sauce on top. Good thing is, they plated it w/limes this time, without having to ask for it... when they once have that green sauce! CCF, do yourself as favor, stop messing up them sauces! If it's not broken..why fix it?! - My once fave pasta dish, Chix Marsala w/mushroom over Bowties...tasteless n bland. Needs some sauce ppl..not just a tablespoon of it drizzled on!!  I'm not giving up my fave, but I'll make sure I'll ask them to serve it up w/sauce...please!!! -Our server, sloppy! Settings were opened up from their usual wrapping w/the napkin...the knife was found at the seat next to me. When asked for another setting, she came back 20min later w/still wet utensils scattered over the table...no napkin this time! I washed it with my tea...didn't feel like waiting for another 20. Came back but then, didn't clear out our table. Btw, they gave us next next-available-seating, at the outdoor patio. *Sigh* wanna go home...stressed out a bit between the waitress, cool July nite, n then a heated lamp next to me...seems like I'm getting my hair done at a salon.. My BFF n I ordered cheesecakes to go. I got mines up at the counter. The few waitstaffs waiting for their cheesecakes were very nice...suggestions on flavors to the indecisive me! The guy, Aldwyn B, who took my cheesecake order was calmed n chilled under all that madness. Even when I was deciding between 2 flavors. Very helpful n patient.

Jennifer N.,"Boston, MA",1,31,3,1.0,1/21/2014,"I've gone here a couple of times and the service is awful.  The first time I sat at the bar. The older bartender was more attentive but once he went on break and was replaced with a younger girl, she never once came over to check on us. She was literally socializing with her coworker and favored customers the entire time. It was very frustrating. We sat at the other side of the bar and she literally stayed on the opposite side the entire time. My brother didn't get a chance to order his food until the older bartender came back. Given the environment, it's too rude to yell ""excuse me"" from across the bar because then I'd have to raise my voice to be heard. The second time was even worse. It was a very busy Saturday during lunch time. The host said it would take 15-20 minutes to seat the 3 of us. The waiting area was incredibly packed but we managed to seat ourselves on the waiting bench directly across the dessert cashier (which isn't far from the host, just several feet away). An hour goes by and we're still not seated at a table and it's still really loud and packed in the waiting/dessert area. Mind you, I am starving at this point and was patient enough to wait this long assuming the wait for my table was longer than the host expected because, again, it's still loud and crowded around me. After I managed to push past the crowd to the host, I asked him how much longer the wait would be. He goes ""oh, your name was called a long time ago. Your buzzer didn't go off because it's broken"". If he had in fact called my name, he obviously didn't try very hard because I was sitting nearby. It's way too loud to call someone's name from your post and assume the entire waiting area can hear you when it's insanely busy. I was so irate. The host really couldn't step into the crowd of people to call my name? Knowing that my buzzer was broken. WHY WOULD YOU USE BROKEN BUZZERS?! I was livid but was seated immediately. I still was friendly to my server, saying please and thank you but I can't force a smile when I'm dying of hunger over here. And she cheerily told us to ""not be so difficult next time"". Woman, do you know what your people have put me through? I am never coming back. This place is absolutely dreadful for service. The quality of the food doesn't even matter.

The atmosphere is nice with low lighting and music even though it is usually a full house. The prices are tipping in on the slightly high side - for a typical date with 2 dinners, 2 drinks, 2 desserts (or an app) the cost is probably going to tally up to $70 including tip. The food is worth it though. The louisiana chicken and chicken bellagio are spectacular. Plenty of food for leftovers. We usually get dessert to go to enjoy together the next day while watching a movie (nice cheap-ish date). As for the desserts - wow, amazing. My husband always gets the chocolate tower cake (yum). I've sampled many of the cheesecakes and suggest the smores inspired one.  Put your name in early and walk around the mall for a while to kill time.

Katie C.,"Boston, MA",180,587,92,4.0,3/18/2012,"I don't understand why the Cheesecake Factory is always so busy.  Even on a dreary Tuesday night, there can be a half hour - to an hour wait.  The folks in the corporate offices are nothing short of geniuses.  First and foremost, the waiting area is in front of a dessert case.  So unless you venture outside of the restaurant, you'll be sitting in front of cheesecake displays for a half hour - to an hour.  Even if there is no wait, you'll still be forced to wait several minutes in front of the case.  So when it comes time at the end of the meal ... hell yes you'll want dessert! My favorite part of the Cheesecake Factory is the salads.  The portion sizes of all their entrees are ridiculously large, so if you're going to shovel away some food, make it a salad.  I typically get the barbecue chicken salad with the barbecue ranch dressing on the side and it is quite delicious.  If I decide to forego the onion straws on top, it's relatively healthy, too.  The service is professional, and I've never had a problem with being served an incorrect meal.  It's a little on the expensive side, but when you consider the portion sizes, you certainly get what you pay for! The cheesecake is extremely rich and when it's $6 - $8 per slice, you can easily make your own cheesecake for $8 using ingredients you most likely already have at home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=180
soylinduh O.,"Belmont, MA",10,57,45,5.0,1/4/2010,"MMM Chesecakey! First and foremost, happy 2010! I thought it would be appropriate to even out the scales and start this year off with a positive eating experience! After what seems like a full month of over eating and over drinking my boyfriend and I were finally having a calm Sunday.  Since we had to stop by Macy's at the Braintree Mall we decided that we would indulge one more time and go to the Cheesecake Factory.  I have only once actually had the cheesecake because I usually just end up over eating and not having room for dessert. We sat down and ordered some Buffalo Blasts and a white sangria and pomegranate mojito. I could have easily drank a pitcher of the mojito.  The Buffalo Blasts were amazing!  I would highly recommend them.  For the entree I ended up ordering the factory burger and salad...maybe my body would think I was doing it some good by not getting the fries. On our way in, the man noticed a red velvet cheesecake and out waitress highly recommend it and she was right, it was incredibly delicious.  Another plus, for every slice 25 cents goes to feed America.  This one last splurge was a very good idea and now I can't wait to get back on the gym wagon. So...let's review... 1. Order the Pomegranate Mojito 2. As an appetizer get the Buffalo Blasts 3. Help out America and get the incredibly delicious red velvet cheesecake Until the next review!  (I hope you're ready to travel!) look at my blog for pictures",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=180

Had the best waitress in the world who I believe was named Siobhan. I was happy to see the new skinny menus had the milk icons for hidden dairy. That helped me out tons! I tried a new app which was the Charred Shishito Peppers and fell in love. I didnt care either was about the sauce they give you but my fiance loved it for the app he had! Again wait staff is everything and you hit a home run with ours. She was hysterical. Good overall experience! Oh but dont eat outside there was some odor in teh mall parking lot in that area.

I've been here on multiple occasions and it's always ridiculous. The staff just kind of ushers people around while they wait but don't really know what to do with them. And once my food came out really late and really messed up and I asked to have it remade/sent back and the manager came over to question me about it. As if I had done something wrong...

The location was clean and parking was kind of difficult, being in a mall on a Saturday I was expecting a wait and parking far away from it.  Once seated it took a little time for our server to get to us. Our drink order arrived and the only drink that was screwed up was, of course, mine. I ordered a light beer, but got a regular, no worries though, it was good.  our order arrived haphazardly and with some delay in the dishes. I'm used to the whole table being served at the same time, not one plate every 5 minutes or so.  As far as the meal quality itself, it was good. I ordered the Filet Minion and it was ok, I ordered med rare and it arrived medium.  As like all the other locations, it was packed.  The location was clean and pleasant.

The wait time can be a nuisance but it is right in the mall so you can just shop around while waiting.  The service is incredible. They are attentive and knowledgeable. The menu is vast so it can take awhile for me to figure out what I want.   I really like their free bread too! What i love to order there: LEMONADE- I love the sugar around the rim. Gets me hyper happy every time! Calamari- I have never tasted calamari as good as these. You can't get any better. It's not chewy or rubbery like some places. When you bite a piece, you can actually bite it. Its melt in your mouth wonderful! Salmon Firecrackers- Its salmon in a fried spring roll. It's something nice to try once and tasted very good. Portabella Mushroom Sandwich- I When I first ordered this it was a huge surprise.  love how greasy it is! The portabella is very juicy! I love it! Most of the sandwiches comes with fries and they are prefect to the crisp!

I found this spot to be just as nice but not as crowded. I was happy to see that they have added a healthier menu filled with low calorie/fat  drinks,appetizers and entrees. They however do not have a dessert menu but no complaints as I rarely ever finish a meal nevermind have room for dessert. I decided to try the Skinny Red Sangria and it was delicious you would never know that it was a diet version of the original (which I have tried in the past) I also got the Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls even though they were an appetizer they were just enough to fill me up. I left the restaurant not feeling overly full but satisfied. I also liked coming out knowing I didn't ruin my diet for the week as I am trying to lose some more weight for a ball gown I need for a Military ball I'll be attending in a couple months.

Elizabeth B.,"Quincy, MA",5,25,,2.0,5/15/2011,"Came in for brunch Sunday with my mom and sister.  Restaurant deserted (but it was 10:30 on a Sunday, probably to be expected). -2 stars for service.  Our waitress could not possibly have been LESS interested in providing adequate service to our table.  No good morning, no chit chat.  Basically: ""Do you know what you want to drink?""  Disappear for ten minutes, bring two sodas, forget my mom's juice and take another five minutes to hunt it down.  ""Know what you want for food?"" Order, and food shows up relatively quickly, which was nice.  My brioche egg sandwich however, was lukewarm, the same for my sister's eggs (hence the other missing star). At that point, we were so turned off by the indifferent service that we just wanted to finish and get out.  Cue the check, which took another ten minutes to appear after we asked for it.  Parting gift? The waitress throwing the bill on the table in front of my mother and saying ""I couldn't pronounce your last name if I tried, so here ya go.""   I'll probably be back, but only to order takeout.  I hate experiences where waitstaff make you feel like you're an intrusion on their day.  There are so many options in the greater Boston area, why bother being treated like crap first thing in the morning?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=200

S X.,"Braintree, MA",0,12,,2.0,11/2/2011,"So, its the Cheesecake Factory in the mall -how much can you expect? I didn't go in with high expectations but the hubs and I wanted a drink and sweet one night sort of late and didn't want to schlep into Boston. We ordered a cosmopolitan, shared a slice of tiramisu, and he got a beer. First, the cosmo: WAY too sweet- as in, how did they even get it so sweet? They must have either added some crazy syrup or used concentrated Hfc cranberry juice or -I don't even know. I've downed few billion cosmos in my life and this was candy in a cocktail glass. It was also $11.50 (price NOT listed on the menu of course.) So I've paid that much for a cocktail plenty before, but at the mall?! in Braintree?!  The tiramisu itself was neither good nor bad. It was fine at the core- except it was covered in an ungodly (and inappropriate) amount of whipped cream. Why is there whipped cream at all on tiramisu I ask? Well, maybe because they are trying to make it fancy?  Obviously, the effect is the opposite.  The server was completely unremarkable - he was neither friendly nor rude. He could have been a robot actually. So, in many ways it was precisely what you'd expect- unremarkable, overpriced ($34 for one dessert and 2 drinks), and all around chain-ish.

Kathy Y.,"Boston, MA",182,89,6,3.0,4/9/2012,"We came here on a Saturday Night around dinnertime, peaktime, 7pm.  Of course we expected that there would be an hour wait, which we totally didn't mind.  We were seated and the waitress took our orders immediately as it wasn't our first time there.  We already knew what we wanted. We shared an appetizer The Avocado Eggrolls - Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce.  This was okay, it wasn't as crispy as I expected it to be. We all ordered pastas for our main entrees.  We had finished our appetizer already and were waiting quite a while.  We had wondered what was taking so long as our entrees took over a half an hour after the appetizer to come out.  We wanted to ask what was going on and what was taking so long.   But nobody was around.  When we were finally going to ask, the waitress just came by and said sorry it's taking so long, it should be right out.  No explanations as to why. Our food finally came out after waiting a little longer.  The manager than came out to apologize about how long it took and explained that the pot that they used to boil pastas malfunctioned and it took a long time since all of us ordered pastas.  I guess at least he came to apologize about the wait.   I had the  Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic - Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce.  This is always excellent and didnt' disappoint me.  Portion sizes are big at the cheesecake factory as regulars should already know.  I ended up taking half of it home.    I ordered a red velvet cheesecake to go.  This was a disappointment sadly, I swear the portion sizes for cheesecake use to be larger in the past.

Everyone I've ever spoken with only has good things to say about this restaurant, myself included.  First...the wait. Yes, there is always a long wait at this restaurant. But you know...really, don't you know this going in? If you go early or later then you can avoid it. if you like the restaurant enough, you'll go at an ""off"" time or you'll sit out the wait. Is it the restaurant's fault that they're popular and busy? Should they build an extra story for you to provide you with extra seating? My opinion is that you get what you wait for! Good things come to those who wait, and this is no exception. I have been served by many servers here, all of whom have been attentive, friendly and professional. They know the menu inside and out which is a huge feat considering the menu is about 100 pages long. The food always comes out faster than expected and is piping hot.  Every menu item I have ever tried is delicious! My personal favorites are the Pasta DaVinci, the Chicken Madera and the Factory Chopped Salad. All of the desserts are amazing because it's their specialty! Their cheesecake selection is overwhelming. The Adam's and the Red Velvet are exceptionally good.

Leanna S.,"Foxborough, MA",75,46,241,5.0,12/28/2013,"Excellent waiter, Scott. We have only ever had an issue with one waitress in Nashville, TN. The portions are large indeed, but you don't have to eat it all in one setting, so for those complaining, stop. Unless it's something fried, it will generally reheat well. We get different items as much as possible due to an extensive menu ( which is daunting sometimes). But appreciate the new additions to the skinny menu. Don't come here for ""light and healthy"", but do come here for tasteful and plentiful. The arugula is bitter, so you may want a Caesar salad instead of garden. But we generally enjoy everything. The bread is great and the lunch portions are still very generous. We appreciate the decor and understand that the building needs to meet the demands of the people, but if you're looking for small and quaint, this is not your place. It's generally busy if not packed with a waiting line. Be prepared to wait except during off peak times 2-5pm.

The table, seats, and floors were sticky; and left over food all over the floors. The menus even felt disgusting. I felt like I needed to shower the second I sat down in the booth. The window next to where we sat had nasty food and finger prints all over it... it was nasty. They obviously didnt take the time to clean in between seating people whatsoever. There were fruit flies everywhere, landing in our drinks and food. It took 20mins for a server or anyone to acknowledge that my napkin dropped in the middle of the floor; I left it there waiting to see if I would be brought another clean one. 20 mins before a MANAGER brought over a new napkin and picked up the old one. All the while servers and employees walked over the napkin right in the middle of the floor. The waitress service was sub-par; and not friendly. However, the food was alright; I don't think it was worth the over priced meals but that was the only good thing I have to say about this place, the food was decent.

Ordered BUFFALO WON TONS, one of my favorite apps, started chewing on a bone/cartilage in one, made me sick. For my dinner I ordered the Chicken Madeira, its a pan fried chicken, with mashed potatoes and asparagus (its far from a Mexican dish). It was fabulous, never had to complain about it until the next day when I ate through 90% of the dish for lunch, and found 2 black beans as the bottom of the take away container.

When I do get an entree, I do find myself often getting the navajo sandwich - basically fried dough as my bread. mm yumm!

So I won't bore you with descriptions of foods and such, I'll merely tell you what you can expect at this location. The fact that it is attached the the Braintree mall is a definite plus as the wait times can get to high volumes on holidays and weekends, so it allows you to peruse the stores for abit before your buzzer goes off to be seated. The floor plan is more of an open room, slightly different from the Providence and Boston chains with the elaborate rooms and levels for booths and tables.

But given the variety of dishes they offer, they do it all pretty well. I've always had pretty decent service... I mean, after waiting our quoted ""55-70"" mins for a table (there were 7 of us), I'd expect nothing less. But our server just didn't seem that into going out of his way. He just didn't make himself that available. He also skipped me when taking drink orders, then checked in with the table behind us, then returned to take mine. It was like he knew... not cool. As for the food, it was a-ok. I had the chicken di pana... I can't get enough of the potatoes at CCF. Everyone seemed generally pleased with their entrees and drinks.

The last few times I went including this past Thursday, it has become dirty. The tables always have grime to them and it's starting to look dingy in there. They must get a better cleaning crew.  As for the wait, it's just plain ridiculous here. I went on a Thursday evening not a Saturday night and waited for almost and hour???? That confuses me as it was only mildly busy for this restaurant. I've been to many different locations and ones out of state (Fort Lauderdale, North Carolina, Rhode Island) and have never waited this long, EVER!  Then we get the most crazy, rude, grungy looking waitress. Her name is Kerry BTW and looks to be in her late 40's. She grilled my licence and said that her uncle died in his home 2 years ago on the road I live on. I do remember this home being dilapidated for a long time, but that was TMI for the attitude she was swinging. Then she ""needed"" to add her personal favorites on to all courses we ordered, just to let you know, we never asked.  When I went to pay the bill with my debit card, she asked for my license, as if she hadn't studied it hard enough before. Was she trying to memorize it, I don't have my social on there. WEIRDO.

Eric T.,"Marion, MA",57,247,22,4.0,1/30/2010,"I was lucky enough to get a Cheesecake Factory gift card for Christmas so I got around to cashing it in. I know it's a chain, and attached to a mall, but if it weren't for the shoppers with their Macy's bags you wouldn't even notice. It had a very nice one off kind of feel about it. As soon as we walked in we saw the place was PACKED, so the 45 minute wait didn't bother us much. They don't have a ton of space for customers waiting for tables, but we were able to sneak a spot by the bench at the main door. That was a prime people watching spot. You wouldn't know there is a recession going on if you sit here for a half hour on a Saturday night. There is nothing but well dressed shoppers, families, and couples milling around. Dropping $7 for a slice of cheesecake at the counter doesn't even phase anyone.  Now onto our seats. We were seated in the middle of a long section. One side was a bench than ran the length of the floor, the other side were comfortable chairs. I guess this makes it easy for them to host large groups if needed but if you're seated next to another table beware, you'll learn everything you'll want to learn about them and then some. There is just no privacy. On one side of us we had a table of four that looked and talked like Jersey Shore cast offs. One guy returned from a smoke break, and brought the stink back in with him. On the other side, two girls in their early 20's who sounded like they were on The Hills (only add 50 pounds). I had to sit here and listen to some girl go on and on and on.... and on about who's ""hooking up"" with who, and so on. I just wanted a quiet dinner with my girlfriend. I didn't need to hear all this crap. So if you go ask for a booth.  That will be the end of the negative part of this review. Everything else was great. Our waitress was friendly, quick, and attentive with out being annoying. We skipped on the apps and enjoyed the bread they bring over when you sit down. The meals took very little time to come out. We both ordered chicken pasta dishes. I got the Chicken Belagio that was on the special card. The chicken and prosciutto were a great combination over some pasta with a basil sauce. For a chain or anyplace it was a good dish. I hope it's no the menu next time I go.  For dessert we split a Dulce De Louche cheesecake. I wish I got my own, but it was rich enough and filling enough to split. The coffee that washed it down was brewed to perfection. It's nice to get a fresh cup of coffee so late at night.  I'd be happy to come back to the Cheesecake Factory again. Next time I'll be sure to ask for a booth. Go here expecting a wait, and remember it's a chain attached to a mall, so you won't get a quiet dinner setting, and you'll have a great time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=240

Yeah, great service, NOT. Had the Ahi Tuna steak that was wasabe encrusted. The fish cut itself was good, but I didn't like the way it was prepared. It wasn't spicy at all and was quite watery. Sitting on a bed of rice didn't do the trick. The rice wasn't good at all and it was sitting in a bed of BUTTER. Who prepares Ahi Tuna Steak with so much butter? The handmade guacamole and chips was amazing as usual. Very addictive. Get the spicy. It's about 2 on the spicy scale. NOT SPICY ENOUGH. It's sad to see leftover chips when there are no guacamole left. The salsa isn't all that. The malibu pina colada was OK. Not the best drink I've had.

John A.,"Medford, MA",45,248,21,3.0,2/7/2010,"The menu at the Cheesecake Factory is an extensive list of many different food offerings and somehow they manage to make every dish respectable.  I've eaten here a few times and while I can say the food has been good, I don't think they have one signature dish that really stands out from the rest (the cheesecake doesn't count).  If you're feeling the ""I'm and American"" attitude then this place is perfect because the servings are absolutely and utterly massive.  You'll have enough food for dinner and lunch for the rest of the week. The problem with the Cheesecake Factory is that the waitstaff is unable to keep up with the popularity of the place.  This isn't because they're less efficient than other restaurant staff but because the sheer volume of people that frequent this place on any evening is enough to overwhelm even the most seasoned waiter.  For this reason the service is unfortunately sub-par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=240
Hector K.,"Boston, MA",19,7,,2.0,7/20/2012,"I recently went to the Cheesecake factory with a couple of my sisters. It took a while for us to be seated, but that's because we got there right in the middle of the dinner rush. Waiting wasn't too bad because you get to look at all the nice cheesecakes in the case. Eventually, we got a booth, which was huge, even though there were only three of us. It looked like it was made for eight people. We had their buffalo chicken appetizer, which was good, but you can't really screw up buffalo chicken at a restaurant. For my entrée, I ordered the shepherd's pie. It was pretty good, but it was nowhere near great. The ground beef didn't taste that good, and the mushroom sauce wasn't really that good either. The mashed potatoes on top were good, as were the vegetable mixed on the bottom mixed in with the beef. Overall, it was an okay dish, but I do expect better from them. I've been to a different Cheesecake Factory location before, and the food was great, but that's probably because I ordered a different dish. I got the Chicken Chipotle Pasta before, which was wonderful, and the portion is huge. Anyway, after that, I got dessert. I had mango key lime cheesecake, which was great, although they put way too much whipped cream on my plate. I don't understand why I need whipped cream on the cheesecake and three more piles of it on the plate. I didn't end up paying much, even though I ate a lot. So, you get a lot of food without spending too much money, which is always good in my opinion. Of course, I have to mention the wait staff. Our waiter was extremely nice, but he was a little frazzled. He seemed kind of all over the place. So, it took longer than usual for us to get things like extra bread or another glass of water, but I guess that comes with going to a restaurant at their busiest hour. Either way, he was nice, but I think he talked too much. Overall, I think I had a good experience there.

The service was terrible. When one the guests in my party was finished eating an appetizer we shared, the server removed the knife from her plate and placed it in on the table....I mean, not only is that a little unhygienic, but I a little wierd? She could have taken the knife and gave her a new one or simply placed it on her bread plate...maybe that is just me. Another thing that bothered me with the service was the waitress didn't wait until everyone was done eating to clear the plates and she actually gave people in my party their leftovers while people were still eating...again a little weird. Now to the food...I don't what it is about this location, but the food is sub-par. I have been to other locations and I felt that the meal I had at the Braintree location was not consistent with other locations I have been to.

My last visit proved to be a relatively expensive disappointment.  Our first negative experience was the wait. Understandabley, a popular chain restaurant like this would have a long wait which we were okay with. However, when parties of 2 that put their names in after us got seated before us, we started to get fed up since we had been waiting for over an hour when the expected wait time was half an hour to 45 minutes.  When we finally sat down and got our food, we were further disappointed. My boyfriend and I didn't order anything that would take too long to make since at that point, we were pretty hungry after the wait. He got an omelette and I got an order of fish tacos. After another half hour, our food finally came but it seemed like the food had been sitting out for at least 15 minutes before it arrived at our table. The fish tacos were soggy and had absorbed all the juices from the tomatoes and the omelette was cold.

Having two young children who love this restaurant, we've already frequented it 5 or 6 times. I've tried so hard to want to go back seeing as it's so convenient, but the service has been so awful each time, that for the money, we'd rather go elsewhere. The food has been delicious each and every time we go, but for some reason, we wait at least 20 minutes AFTER being seated to have just our drink order taken. By this time, we are ready to order as well except I guess that's a little too much for the staff since we don't even get our drinks until our food has almost been brought out. For me, drinks are equally as important. I am a diet coke drinker and usually go through about 2 refills. I don't think I've ever been given a refill the times we went at this location.  My point is, the food is fantastic, but the young staff that is employed at this location is very below par.

Cheesecake makes a perfect place for any type of gathering, whether it's a family outing, a romantic date, or a fun rendezvous with some great friends. A few of my favorites. 1.) 1st and always, the honey wheat black bread. I can eat a whole roll and more if I momentarily forget the gigantic entree to await, along with the infamous amt of calories branded to these Cheesecake dishes. 2.) Chicken marsala with the bowties. The chicken is tender, the mushroom is tasty, and the sauce is amazing. 3.) Luau salad. This will appear like a mountain before you, but it is so delicious that before you're aware of stuffing bite after bite down your mouth, the mountain is conquered. 4.) The cheesecakes. If you still have room in that belly of yours, any of their dessert selections will complete your night.  I enjoy all my dinners at the Cheesecake Factory.

Overall, we had a good time. Our waiter was nice even when he keeps making small mistakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=120

Angela M.,"Brighton, MA",121,9,4,1.0,8/27/2014,"Let me start off by saying The Cheesecake Factory is my all time favorite restaurant. That being said this is the worst location I have ever been to. I typically would not take my time to come on here for a bad review especially because every time is not going to be the best experience - but when the last three times have all been AWFUL experiences I figured I should voice it after all it is my money that went to waste. 1st bad experience - we were told it was a 20 minute wait turned into waiting for 45 minutes. We got seated our server was never informed another 10 minutes before we were approached. I don't blame her I get it they were too busy for their staff to manage correctly she was very pleasant. I was with a friend we both ordered same meal the Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoe which is my favorite but not when it comes out with watered sauce and no flavor. The server explained they had new cooks... I never send my food back but we did. We opted with just getting apps but by the time we actually got them neither of us we're hungry so we ended up getting to go boxes. To put in perspective we got there at 6 and didn't leave until 9:30 between the ""20 minute wait"" and everything else. 2nd bad experience - we were seated in the bar which is fine different server again wasn't told we were seated eventually made it over and apologized - but it wasn't a busy night. I believe then our salads were forgotten to be entered because the people who came after us with pasta dishes came out before ours. 3rd bad experience - this past weekend sat outside with the nice weather at a DIRTY table with no silverware or plates server drops off the bread and runs for the hills. Didn't make a big deal just ate at the dirty table had another employee grab us silverware. We order our food and my friends food comes out completely wrong. Again didn't bother to complain. It's unfortunate this location does such a poor job and gives the franchise a bad rep.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=120
Casey O.,"Boston, MA",3,15,,4.0,8/23/2016,There are so many options of food to choose from here. I have a gluten allergy and found it extremely helpful that they label everything that is gluten free on the menu. I had the guacamole to start and the chicken lettuce wraps for a meal. They were both good! My only complaint would be that the chicken wraps had a little too much slaw in them for my liking. My boyfriend got one of the salad options and let me just say - the salads are HUGE. I think multiple people could split it.

We were told there was over an hour wait, typical for a saturday, so we got our buzzer and sat down. About thirty minutes later a girl sits on the side of us with our friends and begins her one hour wait. Twenty minutes after that she decides to go complain to see if she can get a table faster. Mind you her party was bigger than ours. And she comes back laughing because she succeeded. So her and her friends get seated before us. Im very dissapointed in the management for this. We stayed and waited our renmaining twenty minutes or so and had an awesome meal with an awesome waitress, i wish i remembered her name so i could give her some credit. However i cannot believe that management just gave this girl who complained a table, which probably shouod have gone to someone who was patiently waiting. So not how you run a business. If we had no already been waiting over forty five minutes and had a giftcard to spend we probably would have left, the girl also thought it was a huge hilarious joke. Ha ha. Very funny.

Juliana P.,"San Diego, CA",29,271,19,2.0,10/23/2014,"I'd like to specifically dedicate this review to the Cheesecake Factory ""skinny"" menu.  Overall, at this location we had great service and sat at one of the ""bar"" tables. It always kills me how fancy Cheesecake Factory is inside...for a chain.  Anyways, it seems like Cheesecake Factory is of the ""any meal is a 500 calorie meal depending on what you eat"" school of thought. Most of the options on this menu were the same unhealthy choices they normally have, just in tiny portions. Luckily they adjust the prices accordingly. And to be honest, their normal portions are way to big, so it's nice to get small plates from this menu.  I won't even go into what my meal companion had (not on the skinnylicious menu or whatever). I ordered the grilled artichoke and the beet salad. I wouldn't reccomend the beet salad--it just didn't really taste fresh, and it was a little acidic in a bad way...like the beets had been washed in soap or something. The grilled artichoke was actually really good. The dipping sauce is a nice little addition to the plate so you don't feel like you are totally eating rabbit food. I applaud the commitment to giving more options, but I find that cheesecake factory often does a lot of things but not well. I know ""dessert"" and ""skinny"" seem like they are mutually exclusive, but I would push them to develop more gluten free or vegan options for dessert (I know they can do more than a bowl of strawberries if they have 30+ cheesecakes).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=80

Chad G.,"East Weymouth, MA",65,58,98,4.0,2/28/2015,"""Chad's Eats"" review of The Cheesecake Factory   Cuisine: Friggin Everything ! Location: Braintree Mall  Parking: It's the mall so on the weekends and especially losing hundreds of spots to snow mountains it can suck  Decor / Ambiance: Beautiful. This is a top class chain in my mind. There are a few chains I endorse and this is one.  Greeting:  Pros even when slamming busy they have a system in place to get you seated at quickly as possible.  Menu mix:  Oh boy! When I said ""friggin everything"" in the cuisine I meant it. It is without a doubt the biggest menu you will ever see. It's a lot to take in AND they got specials on top of the endless selections. Pick any cuisine and I guarantee its  on there.  Water / Bread service: Excellent, bread is great. They give you a dark molasses type bread and a French baguette. Hard to stay away from eating it all.  Drink pour:  Don't  remember getting wine or drinks but from what I have seen at other tables it looks like a generous pour.  Food quality:  I always enjoy my food here. Food always seems to be fresh, the presentation is always neat and clean flavors are always right on. Service: These folks are pros. Very attentive.  Value: Consistent with the food quality, service and ambience  Bathrooms: Spotless  Would I return? Always do, mostly for lunch Comments & Tips:  They have great salads, one of my favorites is in the skinnylicious menu. Goes down grade after having a couple of cheeseburger sliders which are awesome. I also really like their fish tacos and when it comes to their cheesecakes it is one of the hardest decisions you'll ever make in life because they're so friggin awesome.

Beth R.,"Boston, MA",158,393,111,5.0,1/2/2013,"I know a lot of people who are ""over"" the initial hype of The Cheesecake Factory from years ago when they started popping up.  The chain was all the rage because of its large comfortable atmosphere & seating, huge menu and options upon options of drinks & of course, cheesecake!  You can order out too & even request a whole cheesecake be made for take-home to that special occasion.  The ""large"" theme doesn't stop with my prior comments, The Cheesecake Factory has a huge waitstaff & appropriately schedules employees for their most busiest times.  I love their strawberry lemonade, mac & cheese, Renee's Special, chicken marsala, salads & desserts.  My fondness for The Cheesecake Factory doesn't end there...my husband conducted a surprise proposal for me with the help of our waitress at this location, how could I ever be anything BUT ""over"" it?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=220

Kestrel D.,"Arlington, MA",113,50,1,4.0,4/16/2011,"I'm in my mid-20s, have lived in the Boston area since college, and had never been to any Cheesecake location. Of course, I had heard about it - the people who detest it take offense to the same things that its fans love - for example, the million-page menu. I'm not a huge lover of chain-type restaurants, but I remained open-minded. We arrived around 8pm on a Friday, and were informed of the 50 minute wait. Undeterred, we grabbed drinks at the bar and settled in for the duration. Step 1 of the night, Grey Goose dirty martini, received an A-rating, despite the fact that I was hoping for more than 2 olives and a little more dirtiness. Initial observations were that the decor of Cheesecake is certainly strange (reminds me of Aladdin or something, or maybe the inside of a cheesecake?), and that I love those little hand held buzzers that summon you to your table, because then you can be pretty certain they will not lose you and you won't miss your name being called. Allows you to enjoy your drink stress-free. All restaurants should have them. And then, said buzzer buzzed after no more than 20 minutes - who doesn't love an under-promise/over-deliver wait time prediction?! The person who seated us was over-enthusiastic and hilarious (in a good way), and our server, whose name was Joe, was attentive and friendly. The food was good - not amazing or to die for or anything, but certainly yummy. Fresh ingredients, enormous portions, flavorful. How do they do that with so many dishes on the menu? And so many people to serve? Mystery.  Because the name of this place is the Cheesecake Factory, we got some cheesecake - some caramel peanut butter chocolate creation. While I felt the strong desire to purge afterward, it was worth it. Cheesecake, you did good. I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=220

I have never seen a place where even the salads make me feel guilty just by looking at them.  The portions are not huge, they're offensive.  How is it even possible for one person to eat something that MUST be for the high school football team.  I mean seriously.  You take left-overs home and it's like Thanksgiving - you're eating the same thing for a week. This place is really good when you find yourself with a large group of people to feed.  The menu is HUGE, and it has a little of everything - sure fire why to please everyone in your group of 15 people.  The inside...OK.  I feel like I'm somewhere in Jersey.  No offense, but this is the tackiness that pop culture media has beaten into me about Jersey culture. The food, though, is solid.  Every once in a while whoever is making the food goes a little spice happy, and whatever dish you have is just TOO MUCH flavor wise.  The Buffalo Blasts are awesome!  Yummy Buffalo Chicken wrapped in a wonton and fried - it's like a Buffalo Chicken Crab Rangoon, minus the crab.  I also like the Crispy Beef, and the Lettuce Wrap appetizier.   You can't really complain about places like this.  They market themselves to a certain demographic and they make a killing - there's nothing wrong with that.  On top of it, with decent food & service, what other places will happily accomodate your group of 10+ people AND allow each of them to have Americanized versions of Asian, Mexican, Italian, & Comfort food under one roof?  Seriously.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=220

I didn't leave any room for cheesecake this time but I've had it there before and all varieties I've had so far have been great. I just found out there today that they're implementing this new thing where you have to ask for bread if you want it served to you. Because both myself and the table next to me hadn't been served bread yet and when we asked about it the waitress explained that the reason that the bread is no longer being served automatically is due to people with food allergies and from now on if a table wants bread they must now ask that it be served. This is a first for me because I've been there countless times in the past and have never had to ask for it. My guess is they may be trying to cut back on waste.

First Let me say that I have been to at least half a dozen cheesecake factories across the country and have had great experiences at all of them, except this one.  I visited this location 3 times in the last 2 months. I will never go back.  First visit, terrible service. Took 20 minutes to have our server take our drink order. When we said ""can we give you the whole order now?"" She said ""no, I'll have to come back for that"". We ordered two apps ahead of our meal. But our main courses arrived WITH our apps. Same time! We expressed our dismay and the waitress said ""do you want me to take your food back and keep it warm?""  Yeah, no thanks.  So we tried at again two weeks later. Better service but once again, apps came out with our main courses. We told the waitress that this happened to us 2 weeks earlier.   She alluded that it was a common problem.  Last week we said ""let's give it one more shot"". This time we sat at the bar. It was around 9pm on a Saturday. While the drinks came quick since we were at the bar (go figure) we waited 22 minutes to get BREAD (we timed it). Put in our app and dinner order and SPECIFICALLY SAID "" can you make sure our apps come out first?"" The waiter looked confused and said ""of course"". Low and behold, 20 minutes later another waitress shows up with a big tray with our apps AND dinners. At this point I was pissed. I said ""why does this ALWAYS happen here? Do you not understand what an appetizer is?, this happens here all the time"" her response was ""really? All the time?""  With a snotty tone. I asked to speak with a manager. Nobody ever showed up. Our original waiter came back and asked ""how is everything?""  I pointed to the apps on the table with our dinners and said ""what do you think?""  He looked surprised and apologized but made no offer to correct the situation.  So I am never giving this location another dollar again. Either their training is lacking or their is zero management oversight.

Fried appetizers were good because they were fried. Burger is average, eggplant Parmesan is average, chicken Madeira is very good however. I think that's one of their few staple items that remain popular. The dessert was like a top of a wedding cake you take out of your freezer a year later.   Which was surprising and disappointing. However the number 1 most mind blowing thing about this surreal experience was the check included a suggested gratuity.

Got the Cajun jambayalan pasta and it was pretty plain compared to say the spicy chipotle pasta I usually get. We also got the herb salmon, spicy chipotle, shepherds pie, and a cheeseburger. The salmon was pretty good, not too dry. The sauce was tangy and the asparagus was a little bitter to my taste. The design kind of looks like a claw with a bunch of fingers too so we got a laugh out of that. My friend says that it was pretty plain.  The shepherds pie was not what I had imagined. It had mashed potatoes on top with mushrooms and ground beef on the bottom with a subtle sauce. I thought it was all right when I took a bite out of it from my friend's plate.  The spicy chipotle was okay. Just like the usual which is always a plus.  The Cajun pasta had shrimp and chicken. They were both so full of moisture and not dry. The only down part was that the whole dish isn't very seasoned. It was so plain I had to add extra salt and pepper to get SOME flavor in my mouth.  SERVICE: It was really good. Our waiter was super friendly and got us a lot of bread which I personally loved. The only downside was that my friend's spicy chipotle order was wrong.

Amir S.,"Boston, MA",282,21,12,2.0,8/18/2016,"We planned a birthday outing for my daughter who turned 11. Ordered a Red Velvet cake for our table. For starters, we ordered the Firecracker Salmon (extremely salty this go round) and the Chicken Dumplings (too salty for everybody's taste buds). My wife ordered the Tex-Mex (her favorite), and unless you like beef, corn and whatever else goes in that, there was absolutely NO SEASONING. For the meals, I asked the server what sides came with the burger. She explained that I had the option of having regular fries, sweet potato pies or seasoned fries. I chose the seasoned fries and a medium burger. My daughter ordered the golden fried shrimp with fries. My wife ordered the Mac and Cheese Balls. Our order comes back and the fries were cold WITHOUT seasoning. I asked the server if they had any seasoned fries. She replied: ""those ARE seasoned. They're seasoned with salt."" I then asked, so what's the difference between your regular fries, your seasoned fries and your sweet potato fries? She said: ""the fries are seasoned."" I sent the plate back and I also sent back my daughter's salty dumplings. The manager brought back the ""seasoned"" fries and they were cold. I complained that it appeared they had seasoned cold fries. The server tried to convince me they wouldn't do that (while I'm staring at a cup of cold fries). Needless to say, they took the whole plate three times with the same burger on it that had now gone from medium to nearly well done somehow, but definitely cold. I changed everything and got chicken sliders. They brought them out hot, minus the cheese, and NO SEASONING WHATSOEVER. Since the place was built, my wife and I have been there countless times. This is perhaps the worst of times. I tipped the server $26 (a little over 20%) because I would hope it would be an incentive to REMEMBER A SIMPLE GLASS OF WATER next time.  After the manager gave us this history rhetoric about how the morning prep comes in and makes sure every ""ingredient"" is added to their 30-something-year specifications, we left. As always, the cheesecake was on the square. OH! The manager came back to the table and said: ""I checked and tasted the Tex-Mex, and you're right. They do not have any taste to them. But there's nothing we can do about that now, because whatever we have has been prepped for today already."" ???

Louis C.,"Weymouth, MA",180,187,349,1.0,9/1/2010,"This was going to be a 3 star review but I just can't support the Cheesecake Factory anymore, after my experiences last week.  My girlfriend Kelly and I went here last week for cheesecake to go after a night out. Well, I have a nut allergy and I know that I can only order certain cheesecake flavors. I got the Dulce de Leche, which normally doesn't contain nuts, or mention any type of nut topping in the description. We got home and take out our cheesecakes and there's nuts on top of mine. Now, you can tell that these nuts are sprinkled on and not part of the product so I call up the CCF and ask to speak to a manager. I talk to ""Kelly"" who is the person who also picked up the phone and inform her of my allergy and that there was nuts placed on my cheesecake. I was told that it wasn't ""nuts"", but a toffee topping that they put on the Dulce de Leche cheesecake. I say to her that it's clearly nuts and that another person is looking at it too and saying that they are nuts. She tells me that all their food is prepared offsite and that it's possible that they are prepared near / around nuts. I asked her what she suggested that I do and she said that ""If I really had a nut allergy, she suggests that I don't eat the cheesecake."" THAT'S IT!? No offer to exchange my cheesecake or to refund my money that I spent. NOTHING!! If it wasn't already 11:45pm on a Tuesday I would have drove all the way back and demanded my money back. Instead, when any one asks me what I think about the Cheesecake Factory, I will let everyone that I know about my encounter I had with ""Kelly"" and the Cheesecake Factory in Braintree, MA.

Thick slices of grilled Japanese eggplant,mozzarella, red peppers and a large thick slice of white onion were layered on a sesame seed roll. The menu said red onion.  I know they weren't out of red onion since there was a slice on the burger.  The eggplant sandwich was tasty, but rather difficult to eat since the juices kept dripping out of the other side. I don't think I'd actually consider it ""incredible"".   Lettuce and a slice of tomato were on the side, the tomato didn't look appetizing so I did not add it to my sandwich.  The skinny-licious burger was tiny; we could've just ordered the regular burger,cut it in half and saved the other half, and half of the calories for  tomorrow's lunch.  The skinny-licious salads  were okay, nothing special.  A few pieces of lettuce were wilted.  Service was good.  We ordered our cheesecake to go, since we were full. That was a mistake! The slices seemed smaller than the ones they serve in the restaurant and they were pre- sliced and boxed already in the refrigerator.

Food is good and lots to choose from. Drinks are boozy and large and desserts are well that's what they are known for. Only problem is, it always comes with a long wait for a table and an extremely large bill at the end.  I used to order the chicken costelletta and ask to substitute the asparagus (gag) for the green beans. They used to refuse to do it and even once the manager came over to say no. Why? green beans cost less on the menu than asparagus does and why not just do it to make me happy? they must have got a lot of complaints on things like that because now no one bats an eyelash when I ask. I know it seems silly but if I'm spending a lot of money on food, I don't want to be given a hard time about something silly like subbing a vegetable.

Domenico B.,"Holbrook, MA",181,61,6,3.0,11/6/2008,"Went here on my birthday, not as my first choice, but because it was easy on the day before our move. You get what you pay for. The service was attentive, but we came during a shift change and switched from a pleasant and bubbly waitress to an older guy with a difficult-to-understand accent.  The biggest complaint came with my wife's entrée. She ordered wasabi-encrusted seared ahi tuna. That means the tuna should be cooked on the outside and raw on the inside. What she got was a piece of tuna steak that was ready to be mixed with mayo and slapped on a bun. It was cooked all the way through. Probably because the best way to ensure tuna is cooked properly is to cut it thick, not as thin as it was.  We weren't the only ones to have a problem. The guy at the booth behind us sent his burger back TWICE because it was underdone. My other complaint about Cheesecake Factory is that the menu is way too long. Choice can be good, but too much choice makes it hard to peruse it all and decide in the 2 minutes before the server comes back. It also means that the kitchen has to be prepared to cook way too many different dishes. ""Jack of all trades, master of none."" However, the place is loud enough that a toddler and an infant won't bother other diners with their normal good behavior.

I am not one of those people who complain about friendly service.  It kills me to see people complain about a waiter or waitress being ""too friendly.""  I am always appreciative of friendly service.   But, I recommend that you visit another location.  I am sure I'd be willing to give another location four stars.  This one is practically in the mall at the South Shore Plaza.  Parking is never good, even with that huge parking lot, and it is a long long wait to sit down to eat.  The place is also extremely noisy and not a good date spot.  Avoid the restaurants near malls, because the one in Cambridge has similar problems.  Find another Cheesecake Factory location and you may enjoy it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=260

Five minutes later we put in an app of buffalo blasts (which was sadly the best part of our meal)...and another 15 minutes later we got out appetizer-but still didn't have drinks.  We ended up asking for the manager...who did absolutely nothing but say they were busy-we didn't even get an apology.  There looked to be two bartenders on and the bar itself was half full...one of the bartenders was on her phone (texting or checking Facebook maybe) Then, our server proceeded to avoid us...luckily we'd already ordered our meals.  When the meals came, she did come back about ten minutes later to check how they were-we said ok but only to avoid making her feel any worse. They were both absolutely horrible-my chicken sandwich was dried out and the plate burnt my hand-it must have sat under the heat lamps for awhile.  My boyfriends fish and chips were mostly breading with minuscule bits of what we really hope was fish inside.  He's a huge seafood person and couldn't tell the type of fish they used.

Jay J.,"Quincy, MA",0,18,,1.0,8/20/2008,"The cheesecake factory has somehow convinced people they aren't a chain restaurant and you should feel upscale when tell you there is a 2 hour wait.  I tried going twice and when I heard the wait I went next door to Joe's American Bar and Grill where I was seated right away.  For some reason I went back a third time me for lunch.  The menu was ridiculous to read, the drinks were overpriced, and the food was unexciting.  The only thing I liked was the actual building it's in.  Next time I want to go to a chain restaurant, I'll just go to the 99",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=280
Tammi M.,"Quincy, MA",16,56,,3.0,5/15/2010,It's a consistent place. Service is all right. Food is good. Prices are on par with other restaurants of it's kind.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-braintree?start=280
