T C.,"Seffner, FL",12,310,684,4.0,8/9/2017,"We came by for lunch with a friend after shopping the mall. The restaurant was pretty empty as it was early. The host started to seat us then moved tables for another guest and then seated us. It was kind of strange.  We were greeted with a great waitress, very friendly and attentive. We had two hamburgers, Caesar salad with salmon and avocado toast. We all enjoyed our meals. I would have liked the French fries cooked more but my classic burger was large and tasted. The avocado toast was my daughters favorite. Caesar salad and salmon was good.    The restaurant was clean, we would come by again. We did think the prices for hamburgers and fries was a bit high.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=20
Angel A.,"Lakeland, FL",15,44,35,2.0,11/11/2017,This place is consistently terrible.  I came here a while back and told myself I would not return but against my better judgement I returned.  It has been a while since I was last here so I figured maybe they haveChanged.  but no they haven't food is still bland and not hot when served.  Only reason they got 2 stars is because they're cheesecake is delicious and the service was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=20
Izhak S.,"Riverview, FL",0,6,6,3.0,11/11/2017,"Went there yesterday for dinner with my daughter and grandkids. Wait time given to us was 30 minutes and we had to wait for 45 minutes and the place was really loud. The food was very good, but service was absolutely the worst. Our server didn't attend our table, we had to ask other servers to call him every time we needed. He had an attitude for every single thing we asked. I would probably be back there since the food was good, I hope that next time we will have a better server and the place won't be packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=20

Chad P.,"Lakeland, FL",147,110,607,4.0,5/29/2016,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factories around the country and they're all pretty much the same. They're all laid out the same, they all have the same food, and the staff is all trained the same. I mean, it's a chain restaurant so consistency is the name of the game.  One thing I like about this particular location is that it has outdoor seating; but it is Florida after all.  My particular visit was satisfying, but not perfect. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated when there was clearly plenty of empty tables, but whatever. The waitress was perfectly nice, though she didn't bring any plates out with the free bread. Lame. Turnaround time on our order was about average and my burger was closer to a medium-well than a medium, but it was still quite enjoyable. I will say the fries were excellent. My date got the eggroll sampler but only ate about half and they boxed it up no problem. So there's not much to say about this place. If you've been to one CF you've really been to them all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=20
Lisa M.,"Ruskin, FL",91,12,47,3.0,7/25/2017,"My husband & I ate at the Cheesecake factory last night. We both got a salad. I had the mini-greek...delicious! He had the Caesar salad...he enjoyed it. For our entree we had the Eggplant Parmesean w/angel hair that was tossed in a pesto sauce. It was...ok. It could been great but it lacked seasoning. I never use table salt. I had to last night to get through this dish, so did he. For dessert, I had the Mango Lime cheesecake....it was simply amazing! It had a sweet, but tart flavor that was balanced perfectly. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. If it hadn't been for the flop on the main course, I'd rate the meal a 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=20

Jeremy S.,"Gibsonton, FL",56,77,249,5.0,9/22/2016,"My wife and I come here all the time for their happy hour. I usually get the burger on their happy hour menu which has 2 patties and cheese on a bun with pickles and cabbage on the side if you like. I've also gotten the hot dog before which is very good as well and a pretty good-size which will definitely fill you up. Both cost just around $5 and for another couple bucks you can add fries to it. My wife got the thai rolls this time which she really loved with the peanut sauce that came with it. We generally share the guacamole and chips which is always fresh and you can make it spicy if you like. The drink specials are pretty good too, I usually get whatever craft brew they have on tap. This last time was a pint of Jai Alai for $3.25, but they do have a few 5$ cocktails as well, like the Mojito which is served with fresh mint leaves:-) If you can make it by 6pm on a weekday, make sure to ask the hostess for the happy hour menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=20

Mindy M.,"Lakeland, FL",12,68,118,4.0,5/6/2016,"Never had a bad meal at The Cheesecake Factory.  The wait can be a witch at times.  I always request a booth.  The oat bread they give you while you wait is incredible and all of the entree's are huge.  You will definitely leave with a doggy bag. The only thing that bothers me about this restaurant is the layout.  I absolutely hate the bench seating, there is no intimacy.  It feels like a cafeteria to me. The wait staff is always attentive and quick to refill your drinks.  I always ask them to leave a menu on the table, because it takes me so long to figure out what dessert I want.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=20

Luke B.,"Tampa, FL",112,8,11,4.0,1/13/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a fine example of a chain restaurant done right. As with most chain restaurants, a few details slide through the cracks, but mostly the Factory hits the mark. The staff is friendly, punctual and always ready to refill a water glass or sprinkle some Parmesan. We had two courses for our dinner, an appetizer and two entrees.  The appetizer was an interesting blend of West Coast healthy eating and Asian finger food: Avocado Spring rolls. I can say that they tasted like well-made guacamole (onions, tomatoes, the works) while their presentation (cut in half diagonally and served on a bed of crispy rice noodles) certainly put me in the mood to chow down. Can definitely recommend. For entrees, I had the Pasta Carbonara with chicken  while my friend had the Factory Chopped Salad. The pasta had a creamy, rich garlic Parmesan sauce that, I think, dried out into a thin glaze over the course of my meal. Overall, both it and the chicken were quite good, but nothing stellar.  I only had a few bites of the salad, but I can say it was a delectable menagerie of all sorts of flavors and textures: tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, bacon, bleu cheese and apple just to name a few. I can definitely recommend that dish. One issue left a little more to be desired: the silverware was very poorly washed. My knife had marks all up the blade and the rest of the silverware was only a little better.  Overall, I had a good experience and I can recommend Cheesecake Factory to anyone looking for a healthy or hearty meal. If you want finer dining, there's plenty of other places to look, but Cheesecake Factory has the charm and the wherewithal for you to have a good night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=20

Lindsay D.,"Riverview, FL",193,64,715,4.0,11/22/2017,I went to the cheesecake factory this week in the first time in years. I must say every time I go there I am surprised at how many menu options they have. I really believe anybody could find something to eat here. This time I got the steak Diane and the meat was tender and paired well with the mushroom maderia sauce mashed potatoes. My boyfriend got the truffle honey chicken and it was extremely tender. I convinced him to split his leftovers with me after trying it.  My Dad got the chicken carbonara and loved it especially the cream sauce. For dessert I got the Adam's peanut butter and fudge ripple. It was very good and I loved the butterfinger inside. There food isn't the best I've tried but all of it is very good and the large variety helps.

The place was packed, but we happened to walk in right as a high top was leaving.  Awesome!

Heather S.,"Tampa, FL",38,80,91,5.0,6/24/2017,"Curb side review: We cautiously ordered take out as we have never had a good experience at other restaurants with take out. CF knocked it out of the park! They took care to present the food well and not just throw it in the container in a haphazard way. Presentation is key to set up the mind for a good bite and I cannot say enough how impressed we were. We ordered the meat loaf and bang-bang chicken and shrimp along with adam's peanut butter cheesecake and the new coffee cheesecake.  The entrees were delicious and a large portion neither of us could finish. The cheesecakes were fantastic and the packaging was impressive to have a texture on the bottom so it doesn't slide when eating it (I hate when things slide around in a take out dish!) For curb-side the order was ready in 20 minutes on a Saturday night during dinner rush. I pulled up and called the number on the sign. Food was ready and hot. Service was great! I know, I know how good can it be at my car? The waitress did little things that matter.

Tim K.,"Brandon, Tampa Bay, FL",74,260,457,2.0,3/12/2017,"Tried the local CF w/a $25 gift card I received.  Nice ambiance - a bit loud, though. Sunday.  Busy.  Understandable. Sat at a recently vacated high-top in the bar for 10 min, didn't get bussed and then my beeper went off so I let them seat me. Ordered the Farfale with chicken and roasted garlic.  It was miss ordered, so I waited about 40 minutes for meal.  By the time it came I wasn't really hungry.   Even if I had been, the flavor wasn't great.  It's done in a cream sauce that lacked any real punch.  Plus, I struggled to find the chicken in the dish.  If I'm paying $17 for a meal there'd better be enough for leftovers. I was offered a salad while I waited for my meal to be fixed, but wasn't interested in salad.  When I received my bill there was no adjustment for the wait - I would have discounted the bill for the inconvenience.

Not sure why they were not as hot OR barely hot, but I didn't make a fuss about it. Barry was very attentive and offered to replace my food. It was edible and wasn't entirely cold, just not hot.

Nadine S.,"Apollo Beach, Tampa Bay, FL",87,344,998,4.0,3/22/2015,Arrived pretty early and already a waiting line but had loads of empty tables. Usually see that when not enough staff to cover all the tables. When called they took us to an outside table but clearly not ready so they asked us to go back inside so they could get another table ready. In the meantime several other parties of 4 were seated while we continued to wait. About 10 minutes passed and finally we were seated. The waiter was very prompt and efficient and came right over with water and menus. Food came out quickly and was piping hot and fresh. All 4 of us had something different but we started out with the garlic cheese bread that came with a yummy oil mixture and a red sauce. Delicious!!! I had the small Cobb salad which was massive yo say the least. Could have fed a family of 4. One person had the bacon cheeseburger which he said was delicious and piled high with bacon. Another had a quesadilla which was big as well.  To end the meal 2 got cheesecake of course. White chocolate raspberry and Godiva chocolate. Way too sweet for me but because the waiter brought an extra fork I didn't want him to feel bad so had a taste....they earned their name of Cheesecake Factory.

Ariel T.,"Tampa, FL",91,134,788,2.0,1/23/2016,"**Review is based off of To-Go Experience** I have frequented this Cheesecake Factory's location plenty of times, however I should note I rarely order anything to go from this establishment. Every time I have visited, it is usually for a sit down meal. All of the meals were I have sat down, or have even ordered from the bar have highly surpassed the level of poor service that I received from their carry out service last night. To be quite honest, I'm highly disappointed.  Especially because I spent $40 on to-go food, which to me as a college student isn't cheap by any means.  But alas, I'm highly in love with the Cheesecake Factory's guacamole, the amazing salads, and the addictive appetizers. So, I thought it would be a good idea to order myself some to go and watch a movie in the comfort of my own home. So I did what any would, I ordered ahead while I was at my house, and then proceeded to drive to Brandon to pick my food up. Well, 45 minutes later in the parking there I was-foodless, hangry, and calling them wondering what happened to my order. I was over it. Waiting out in the cold and wind forever, was definitely not Netflix and chilling like I'd intended. I was wondering why the heck everything took an eternity to prepare. I'd just ordered guacamole, Luau salad, and buffalo chicken blasts. Two things that are cold, and a fried appetizer should never take that long!

When we asked to be seated outside we were told they weren't seating outside. When I questioned it, the manager said it was because he was having "" trouble "" with wait staff. We would have to wait 20 minutes. ( vs. 5 minutes for inside seating.) We patiently waited the 20 minutes all the while watching 5 tables finish & leave on the patio. Finally after the 20 minute wait I again went inside only to have the teen hostess dismiss my request. I then said I would definitely be writing a yelp review on this experience. The manager then magically appeared. We were then seated on the other empty patio. Poor customer service. We have been to Cheesecake Factory restaurants all over the US and have never had such a strange and rude experience as far as the staff. The assigned waiter was courteous. The food was not prepared to the usual Cheesecake Factory level. ( The Santa Fe salad lettuce was not chopped and the chicken was undercooked.)

Now, when I finally got my table I was seated in an area that was uncleaned and as noisy as hell. I finally ordered my drink and after that when the bread came, THE WAS NO SOUR DOUGH BREAD! I was really looking forward to trying it but they only had wheat bread which paired with butter is pretty good. So when I got my spaghetti and meatballs, the pasta and the meatballs as a whole were pretty good except for the fact that the meatballs where kind of overcooked on a few sides but that wasn't really a problem. So for the food itself, it was actually pretty decent and the Oreo cheesecake i had was very good! However the atmosphere there is really the pits. It tries to be something classy but doesn't do that good of a job and it's EXTREMLEY noisy especially on a Saturday night.

Ok I understand you are a waiter and know your job but we have been burned before at this location. So my wife request that her dish be served spicy, and Mr McBeardface comes to the table and slams a bowl of chili flakes and says, ""this is all we have.""

He doesn't comp the order, or even take off my drink or anything in which I believe is a ploy to not get in trouble with the management.

I would assume, given the name, that their specialty is (every type imaginable of) cheesecake, for which there is also an abundance of options...unfortunately I have never tried any of them. Today we had the nachos appetizer, and I stopped at that because 1) the plate was rather large for two people, and 2) I still could not make up my mind. The nachos weren't bad. My companion ordered enchiladas, which she said were good (when I want Mexican food, I want to go to a Mexican restaurant).

I recently went to the Brandon location this past Saturday with my parents. for my birthdayI've been to CF in Chicago at the base of the John Hancock building before, and besides the structure itself, the food , service, ambiance were similar. CF could be accused of having a Dissociative Identity Disorder since their entrees range from pastas, chops, seafood, pizza, sandwiches..etc IMO, most of the dishes seem to be covered well. I ordered my staple, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and a mojito.  The mojito was cool , crisp, and great. The pasta was nice and spicy, shrimp fresh, and as is the course with CF, enough for 2 meals. My parents were surprised because they thought it was primarily a dessert place, but were shocked at the dizzying amount of entrees. For dessert, I ordered the Caramel Pecan turtle cheesecake. It was awesome, but cheesecake in any flavor was awesome.  Service was good and the servers decorated the cake plate with ""Happy Birthday"" in syrup and sang which was nice.

Crystal H.,"St Petersburg, FL",437,436,1512,5.0,11/13/2012,"We recently had dinner at the bar at this Cheesecake Factory and I must say it was one of the most pleasant dining situations we have had recently. Our Bartender/ Server Ronnie was on the ball. He had drinks in front of us before we had really even settled into our seats and he kept them full. We like to eat at the bar because it is typically more private than some of the tables, you get a t.v. and you have the bartender (who rarely leaves the area directly in front of you) to wait on you.  We ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and Stuffed Chicken Tortillas for our entrees. They were both extremely delicious. The Stuffed Chicken Tortillas came with 2 delicious corn cakes (sort of like spoon cornbread formed into cakes) that I could not get enough of. The meal had a green sauce that is a little different from what I would traditionally eat (aka red sauce), but it worked out nicely. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta was my Husbands. It is bow-tie pasta covered in a creamy and slightly spicy sauce with fried pounded chicken on top.  We grabbed dessert to go and we were out of the restaurant in less than 40 minutes.

You would think that the service would be bad on a busy night, but our server was very attentive, checking up regularly if we needed anything. Their menu is a bit heavy but I am a fan of their Cajun Jambalaya and Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. However, Cheesecake is the name here an they definately deliver in that department. From their original traditional cheesecake to their many specialty ones, they have one for every sweet tooth. My preference is the peanut butter cup fudge ripple cheesecake.

The service here has always been great, much better than the other location at the International Plaza where the waiters are schizo. It's the place where my nephew tried his first cheeseburger when he was a toddler, birthday parties, and numerous other events have occurred here, it is filled with memories. I love most things on the menu. The avocado eggroll sliders and tuna tartare are my favorite appetizers. I previously ate their burgers regularly, but have found them to be a little too salty in the last few years. The caramel chicken is an awesome choice and is inspired by Vietnamese cuisine with just a touch of spiciness. The four cheese pasta is always great. Their factory burrito grande is no joke, never order it alone unless you plan to box it. Brunch at Cheesecake Factory is always a great thing as well. The factory huevos rancheros are awesome. Like I said before, I will eat almost anything on the love Cheesecake Factory menu. Is it healthy? No. Is it tasty? Yes. The portions are huge, so it isn't a bad idea to share them and then also save on price as well. Finally who can leave the Cheesecake Factory without a waiter or waitress suggested you take some cheesecake home? My favorite cheesecake choices are the fresh banana cream cheesecake and Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Delicious. The bartender always makes great drinks as well and despite the huge crowd, you still get seated in a reasonable manner.

We waited, waited and waited for food.  The waitress stopped by and said its taking a little long on the Thai wraps.  We continued to wait.  Total time 45 minutes, the tuna tartare and mine were brought to table, and she said it would be a few more for the wraps.  My Renee's special was not like the one at International Mall, it was a plate of lettuce, 3 tomato wedges, less than 1/2 sandwich and luke warm soup.

There have been numerous occasions of very slow service; messed up orders and skimpy servings.  Yes, we've noticed Cheesecake Factory servings getting much smaller over the last couple of years.  Tonight, we are done!!! We ordered items and after waiting 20 minutes, we were informed that they were out of a key ingredient. There is no reason for that. If you cannot provide something on the menu, then that is a call that should be made early. Further, this is not some family small business. This is a major chain restaurant and it is lame to be out of something.  Done. This is our last visit to the restaurant. We'll go somewhere else.

James P.,"Apollo Beach, FL",67,459,57,3.0,11/2/2014,"Brandon Cheesecake Factory is truly a mirror of everything Brandon is all about - it's in a mall, the clientele is entirely moms and elderly, and it is completely chain-restaurant vanilla.  Huge portions, expensive domestic beer, and cheesecake galore.  A few notes: - Burgers aren't a great value.  They run $12-14, but the fries that come with are in a little tin cup.  You get BIG BURGER little fries. - There is basically every type of food available through their menu, so if you want something not listed, you can probably get it anyway.  As long as it includes the ingredients they have, you can Frankenstein something together. - Their menu is 30something pages long, but many of those pages are ads.  But who has ever sat down at the Fac (what kids in the know call this establishment), seen an ad for customized Warhol-esque pop art, and gone ""YES I NEED THAT!""   - White napkins shed on your fine clothing.  Ask for black.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=60

Robyn B.,"Orlando, FL",66,157,126,4.0,2/17/2015,"I've visited this location once before and enjoyed my experience. During my most recent trip, the review is the same . I'm going to guess that this location fairly busy all of the time, as it is located in the mall and during both of my visits there was a wait. Thankfully during this visit, we were there strictly for cheesecake so seating in the bar was appropriate. I'm not sure if this is true to all locations, but at this one, you are able to seat yourself in the bar area. They are also full service in the bar so just an FYI for those who don't like to wait :) Our waiter came to take our orders shortly after we sat down and he was very nice and patient. I was with a friend who was slightly indecisive and had several questions about the different cheesecakes that they offer. Our waiter was very well versed in the cheesecake menu and made great recommendations for all of us. We were all very pleased with our choices.  Each time I visit the Cheesecake Factory, I try to order a different flavor cheesecake. On this visit I chose to try the pineapple upside-down cheesecake. Now I've often shied away from this one because when I want cheesecake, I really WANT cheesecake and this particular cake has 2 layers of pineapple cake with pineapple cheesecake in between. BUT I am SO glad that I opted to try this one because it was soooooooooooo delicious! I was extremely pleased with it.  Now, if you've never had a piece of cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory, please know that this isn't your typical thin, petite, restaurant portion of desert. These portions are huge and easily enough to be shared by 2 or 3. If you just want a little taste, make sure you plan to share. One of my friends opted for the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake which had a lighter flavor than the pineapple upside down but was very tasty as well. The other chose the red velvet cheesecake which is extremely rich and sweet. I've had this one before as well and it's an awesome choice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=60

She showed-up and was hungry, it was MY Birthday...she ate,  I was not hungry , she had the chick and shrimp with rice in peanut sauce. It was ok.

I've never really had bad service here, so that's a huge plus. Portion sizes are HUGE. I normally split a meal and still have left overs. The menu is a novel so they have a little bit of everything. Normally with large Menus quality of food can suffer. I have not found that to be the case with CF. The only real downside to me is seating can feel a bit crowded, especially the tables near the bar.

When we were finally seated after a LONG wait where we felt we got skipped, with no apologies we were seated in a small but crowded section with no privacy. I could see they were closing off sections due to short staff or closing in a few hours but I had to ask. As it happens, I asked a person who looked like a server if we could move and it was actually the manager. She sat us alone in the closed section and she must have remembered our wait and personally saw to our needs.

I decided to dine here for a nice hot lunch when I received a room temperature meal NO GOOD! when you order steak and potatoes you would expect it to be hot right. Unfortunately mine was not the plate it arrived on was hotter then the food in it. When the manager came not at my request but the waitress (must be their policy) he assured me the heat on my meal would be corrected. Round 2 the meal was brought to me by the manager nice man mind you he didn't need a towel to hold a so called hot plate and hot food. He waited while I tasted what turned out to be the same temperature as the first plate and I told him so. He apologized for this. I tried to get through the meal but damn it mashed potatoes are suppose to be hot as well as my steak. I asked for my meal to be bagged I wasn't interested in finishing it. At least the manager offered to compensate me with a slice of Cheesecake to which I declined. I guess today was not my day at The Cheesecake Factory.

The wait wasn't too bad and we were seated in the corner of the store next to the silverware guy who rolls the silverware. (First red flag) Our waiter approached us and we ordered, he came back with our drinks and then disappeared. We saw him literally that one and only time. He wasn't busy because his other tables were being treated to, but we were left to nothing. Our drinks were empty and we kept trying to wave him down at his other tables, so I walked up to the nearest hostess and asked to flag him down for us, she said ""no problem I'll get him.""

This past Sunday I was invited to the Cheesecake Factory for some brunch. I had never looked at the menu with the vegetarian filter and let me tell you it wasn't particularly easy. Now, the Sunday brunch menu is navigate-able (yes, I'm making up words) when it comes to meatless options- but there's a lot of cheese/milk products and eggs everywhere. I decided not to get breakfast and ended up settling on the new Skinnylicious Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread and it was (not surprisingly) delicious! At under 490 calories it was a great mid-morning breakfast/early afternoon lunch treat and at only $5.99 it really topped the charts. Laura, my friend, went with the Bourbon Street Omelette with a side of tomatoes and a bagel. Obviously it had a little (read: a lot) more meat than I was looking for, but she said she really enjoyed it. I don't remember what hers cost, but the whole breakfasty list was relatively low cost. Coffee was two thumbs up and service was lazily relaxing. Not that he wasn't a good server, mind you, he just wasn't rushing us and on a Sunday morning I appreciated that. I would definitely look to trying out more of the selection, but I fear my diary-less diet may get in the way going forward.

THE GOOD: My friend and I walked into Cheesecake at prime dinner time on a Friday night. There was a huge line, and of course, the place was packed. However, we were able to snag seats at the bar (why don't people like to eat there with no wait?!). We ordered two drinks, mine a mojito. It was very good. Not authentic, but tasty nevertheless, and the bartender did not skimp on the rum. The service was friendly, prompt, helpful, and great. They deserve 5 stars alone. THE BAD: The food was so terrible. I ordered the fish tacos and I just can't begin to describe how disgusted I was. The fish was fishy (which any seafood fanatic would know that is not a sign of fresh fish...) and the toppings were just out of control, and tasteless. The flavors were not very good, and the soft taco shells tore before I could even pick them up. I ate what I could of them, but wound up eating more bread than anything else. The rice and beans on the side were also disappointing, but I think that was more a personal preference than the actual preparation. It was yellow rice with sweet corn and peas (do not want sweet rice...) and black beans. Not very appealing.

Cons: The wait time tends to be long as peak hours so unless you go on an ""off time"" expect to wait.  I think the thing I dislike the most is the way the seating is arranged.  I don't like ot be seated so closely to strangers when I am trying to enjoy dinner and conversation.  And if you are dining for two this is bound to happen.  I am disappointed they took the crab cake sandwiches and the chicken and dumplings off of the menu!  Both: The HUGE menu- this is good and bad... it can be hard ot decide what you want with so many options! But it is good because again, no matter your mood you should be able to find a food you are craving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=140

This particular cheesecake factory has always had great service and hasn't disappointed me yet. I like that they have a ""skinny"" menu with just as many options as the main menu. My biggest gripe with Cheesecake Factory is that they don't offer ""bites"" or ""samplers'"" of their cheesecakes.

The waitress offered a free cheesecake that she would bring right away. She asked if I wanted whipped cream on it and I told her no.  Of course, it came out with extra whipped cream on the side.  My co- workers joked about it and said they would probably charge for it.  The bill came with my meal and the cheesecake.  They removed the cheesecake after talking to the manager for the fifth time.

Jason H.,"Tampa, FL",3,11,3,1.0,6/6/2014,I had a terrible experience with a hostess at this location. We utilized call ahead seating which I understand is not a reservation but we wanted them to know that a party of 10 was coming with a baby in a stroller. It was a Thursday night and we ended up watching parties of customers (2 to 4 people per party) be seated ahead of us. My wife went up after 20 minutes to check on how much longer and she was told only about 10 more minutes. After another 25 minutes I had lost my patience. The hostess was smug and after I asked for a manager she would not answer any questions I had while we waited for the manager. I would have walked out at this point but my neices and nephew really wanted to eat there. My brother and his kids were visiting from out of town. We had not seen them in almost a year.

It's a huge piece of pounded down chicken cutlet lightly breaded and sauteed with a lemon sauce, yummy!

Keshia J.,"Tampa, FL",2,1,,1.0,9/19/2016,"Went to this location on a Friday night with a party of 18. Expected there to be a wait and had no problem waiting. We were quoted an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. After waiting our allotted time, we asked the hostess how much longer. She told us about 15 minutes. I was annoyed but we had already waited that long so what would 15 more minutes be. After 30 minutes went by, I asked to speak with a manager. The manager (Justin Fletcher) came and said it would be another 15 minutes. I asked him to explain why it was taking so long to get us seated and he stated there were 2 spots in the restaurant that he could put us but they were waiting on tables to leave before they sat us. I then asked why this was not communicated to us after we waited the hour and fifteen minutes, to this he had no answer. I said to him that we had already waited 2 hours and by the time our dinner would arrive to our table it would have been 3 hours that we hadn't eaten. To this his response was ""well we do have to cook the food."" That was the most disrespectful comment. It was then that I told him the party would not be eating here and asked for his name. At first he was reluctant to give it but once I informed him I would be contacting the corporate office he gave his name and this is when he offered to buy our party appetizers. I said no thank you we are done. Never was there an apology given.

It's a huge chain that is known for it's cheesecake and its super diverse menu.  However diverse the food items are, everything on the menu is always really good. It doesn't matter what you order, they do a pretty good job of mastering a lot of genres. I had the Grilled Salmon which was cooked perfectly and it came with a heaping side of Mashed Potatoes (which were delicious) and some Asparagus (cooked perfectly). Someone else ordered the Burger (looked good!) and Fries (crispy and yummy), another, Shepard's Pie (HUGE and tasty) and a Grilled Chicken and Spinach (also perfect). This place is good for kids as the options are plentiful and the plate sizes are""just right"". My 82 year old Puerto Rican grandma ordered off of the kid's menu and said her Grilled Chicken and Mashed Potatoes were ""Berry goodt and no too salt!"" Although we were seated right away, we unfortunately got seated near a birthday party table of 15 people which used up like 6 servers, including ours. We weren't greeted for 15 minutes, were never checked up upon, had to flag our server down for every little thing and waited forever for our check. As I said, it's the service that keeps me away because the food is always tasty. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt b/c we went on St. Patrick's day so they were probably unusually busy. Prices are on the high side depending on what you order, $19.99 for Salmon, $8.95 for the Burger.  Go with a lot of time and an apetite, portions sizes are huge.

Rebecca K.,"Valrico, FL",166,117,47,4.0,5/19/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory for days when I decide to treat myself and indulge in a 3,000 calorie dinner. The fresh warm bread is always a winner. I have had slow service a couple times on very busy weekend evenings, but nothing to really complain about. The food on their 100 page menu is a plenthora of tasty items to choose from no matter what mood I am in. Although, I'm not a huge fan of their light/skinny menu and I'm sad that the past couple times I didn't see the portabella sandwich anywhere on the menu. The flavor seems to be lacking a bit on the couple of dishes I have tried from the light menu. I ordered the light lettuce wraps, but it seemed that I needed to drown the wraps in the accompanying sauces to get any burst of flavor. If you like spicy like I do - try the Black Pepper Jamaican Shrimp entree or the Sante Fe Salad from their regular menu. Portions are enough for two days of eating.  And of course the reason why most tourists or sweet tooths visit is for dessert. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert and their tiramisu cheesecake is absolutely delicious. I never want to eat all of it in one sitting so I can savor it for days, but I always end up cleaning my plate and feeling like a porker waddling out of there. The couple times I've ordered a drink, I have not been overwhelmed, but not underwhelmed either.   PS.

Francesco C.,"Sarasota, FL",2046,176,345,4.0,1/21/2013,"Coming to a popular American Icon, I promised myself not to be too critical to a place in which the name of the business describes as to sell, just multiple variety of ""cheese cakes."" However, when I walked up to the restaurant, I was already in awe with the colorful and fancy outdoor decor and art deco type of building.  So my curiosity had increased to try something new.  Walking in I noticed the long line just to add in their names in a large service book and in hope to be called soon.  While waiting I took a menu and glanced through it to find 6 full pages (12 counting both sides) of food items and only one and a half of cheese cake pictures and variety with their description.  Now, I was stuck to chose.  I had no idea it would have so much to gander.  When I was finally called and sat in a square table, I ordered a sweet drink, the Raspberry Lemonade, my girl friend ordered a Mint Tea.  Soon after they brought out our drinks, warm white bread and pumpernickel bread with butter was given while trying to decide.  Of course, I had to try to convince my 115 lb friend not to read from the ""SkinnyLicious"" menu and actually get some grub.! Finally and surprisingly she agreed and decided on a ""Chicken Piccata"" and I order also from the chicken coup, I ordered a ""Crusted Chicken Romano."" Crusted Chicken Romano was great to the taste, chicken was cut like fillets and tender and breaded nicely, although this was a lunch date, the portion was perfect in size.  Came with Angel Hair pasta with marinara sauce.  On her plate, I found it a little better tasting with creamy lemon sauce dressed with mushrooms and capers, had plenty of shrooms on top and her cut was similar to mine and very tender. Hers also came with angel hair pasta in the same mushrooms lemon sauce sauce.  Food was good!  Finally we ordered the sinner!  A huge piece of Oreo Cheesecake!!  Wow!  Rich and more rich, but great tasting and it marbleized my stomach!  I love this place!

The food is hot, tasty, and you get a fair to large size portion as well.  This place also has takeout if you want to grab your meals to go, also if you order takeout you will not be stuck waiting for your meals for eternity either because they have to do something special for your takeout, with their cheesecake service they are used to the concept of takeout.  Also since this is located at the mall I have placed my order when I enter the mall, do my shopping, and then pick up my meal when it is time to leave.

Bianca A.,"South Bay, CA",17,148,4,5.0,9/10/2009,"I visited the Cheesecake Factory on Labor Day for dinner. The restaurant was full, but to my surprise there was no wait. We were greeted & seated right away by a cheerful hostess. Our server had passed by our table and said he would be right with us. I'm glad he acknowledged that we were there. He returned momentarily and he introduced himself & told us what the specials were as well as his recommendations. He was very thorough and detailed when he explained everything. He definitely knew the menu. After taking our drink order, he dropped off a bread basket which tied us over until the food arrived,which did not take long. I had ordered the Caramel Chicken. It consisted of crispy chicken pieces in a spicy Vietnamese caramel sauce with vegetables and rice. The chicken was very moist & the vegetables were crisp. The caramel sauce was tasty and not too spicy at all. The rice was just right, not overdone to where it was almost gelatinous and not dry either. Nice & fluffy, as I like it, as it should be. The Cheesecake Factory is known for its huge portion sizes & this was no exception. However, unlike other dishes I have eaten, I was able to finish a majority of this in one sitting. Our server was very attentive & checked on us often and refilled our drinks before we asked. Once he cleared our plates, he came back with the dessert menu & again told us his recommendations. I'm glad that he did because there are so many different flavors of cheesecake to choose from as one would imagine. I went with his recommendation of the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake which consisted of original cheesecake, fudge, and chocolate truffle. The cheesecake arrived shortly and it was delicious. It wasn't overly rich at all. It definitely hit the spot. I'm glad I went with his recommendation and it was a perfect way to end the meal. I would definitely come back to this location again. The restaurant was very clean, the hosts were always smiling & the servers were very attentive and knowledgeable. The manager even walked the floor several times, something I hadn't noticed at most of my restaurant visits as of late.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=180
Kristy J.,"Tampa, FL",1,11,2,4.0,9/10/2011,"I really like Cheesecake factory there is always a huge wait so we try to work around the busy times, but the food is really good. You also can get it to go if you are in a hurry. The floor is super slippery though and I almost bust my butt in heels everytime we go there. The staff is usually friendly and we choose a bunch of appetizers and share because they are so good  and for desert do the Godiva choc. cheesecake or the red velvet cake they are amazing!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=220
Jennie T.,"Riverview, FL",0,1,,5.0,3/4/2011,"This restaurant is simply amazing. Everything on their menu is absolutely superb. I believe that everyone should try their ""SOUP OF THE DAY"" because they make something different every single day, and its delicious. The waiters and waitresses are all nice and know a thing or two about at least everything on the menu. I give a 5 out of 5 stars for this restaurant and their service. Everyone should at least try this place out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=220
Katie B.,"Riverview, FL",82,66,5,5.0,4/9/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those rare restaurants where you can satisfy your cravings for both an impeccable dessert and a filling and delicious meal. Its atmosphere is a perfect combination of casual dining and relaxed elegance.  Whether you're taking the kids out or celebrating an anniversary, everyone is sure to enjoy the food, service, and ambiance.  My favorite dessert item is the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake; it's the perfect blend of rich, creamy cheesecake and smooth, mouth-watering chocolate.  The Cheesecake Factory also has an impressive variety of meals ranging from seafood and steaks to chicken tacos.  The chicken and biscuits nearly knocked me over when I had them. The warm and buttery biscuits nestled atop the country gravy, mashed potatoes, and veggies was delicious. I hadn't expected such a down-home delicacy from a place like The Cheesecake Factory. I couldn't recommend this restaurant more highly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brandon?start=220
