Mimi A.,"Riverside, CA",4,27,,2.0,11/6/2016,"Okay so...for starters i gave 2 stars because my waitress Crystal was really nice. If it wasnt for her understanding nature, i would have given 1 star.  So my best friend and i came here to eat a dish that we always order...the 4 cheese pasta (add the lemon sauce from the lemon picatta dish) if you're reading this, try it! Sooo, the waitress comes back to inform us that the chef refuses to add the sauce to the pasta and he will charge us $4 to put it on the side.....(never have i been charged for adding extra sauce) I was appalled and asked to speak to a manager....a manager named Derek was sent our way...he proceeded to argue with us that if we are adding more sauce and not removing sauce then there has to be an additional charge...but he said he agreed that $4 was too much, so he did us a ""favor"" and charged only $1.50 for the lemon sauce ...(kinda disrespectful to charge at all) We figured might as well just stay cuz at least our food will be good....well it came out and it was warm..not hot like we usually like to eat our food. Derek came over once again questioning the temperature of our food. He said the chef handed it right from the pan....and he went as far as sticking a thermometer into my pasta to check the temperature. He agreed that the temp had dropped slightly however he felt it was still hot.   First of all, who are you to tell me how hot my pasta should be? If I like it hot, I want it hot, especially since I am paying for it. At that temperature we pretty much had to inhale our food otherwise it would have been cold within a few min.  We didn't send our meal back, nor did he comp anything. I have been to many restaurants and I've never been treated with such disrespect from management. It isn't about the 20 dollar meal, it's about principle.... Being a former business owner myself, I know that customers are always right (even when they are not, its our job to be respectful and understanding and make sure the customer walks away happy) I wont be returning to this cheesecake factory location ever again....because ive had the same order at other locations and i have never been charged extra, nor have i experienced such disrespect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=120
Mimi L.,"Torrance, CA",3210,1017,9804,4.0,6/3/2015,"It's been a while since we have been to any Cheesecake Factory locations, I really like the cheesecake factory, the food, the relaxing atmosphere, above all? The cheesecakes, I rarely eat cheesecakes, in fact I rarely eat cakes, so I don't mind indulge in some whenever we come here.  We chose to sit at the bar on a Sunday afternoon after shopping, so we didn't have to wait at all. Had a draft blue moon to start, later on I had a Mojito, one of the best summer drinks, very refreshing and tasty.  I ordered off the skinnylicious menu cause I have been on summer bikini diet lately. Edamame was light and yummy as usual, fresh salmon rolls were so good, loved the sweet chili sauce. Veggie burger was delicious, the veggie patty was a little too mushy because it was made with brown rice mostly, but I still enjoyed it so much. Hubby had garlic noodles with chicken, I was surprised he picked a healthier item on the menu, he loved the noodles.  The highlight of my meal was pineapple upside down cheese cake, oh MY, it was so yummy! Pineapple upside down cake is my favorite flavor next to red velvet, it was heavenly sweet and comforting! Didn't care much for the whipped cream as usual. Our early dinner was relaxing and pleassant, the service was friendly and attentive. Definitely a nice spot for a casual meal after shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=120
Cindy L.,"Walnut, CA",178,7,22,4.0,8/7/2016,"The hibachi steak was really tender, and the mashed potatos had a very rich flavor. The jambalaya had a spice that really gave pasta a nice punch! Although the pasta on the chicken bellagio had a very strong pesto flavor, the breaded chicken that topped the pasta was extremely tender and juicy. All of the food we ordered had very large, plentiful servings. We also ordered a slice of key lime cheesecake, which was delicious. Would highly recommend the key lime cheesecake if you enjoy a bit of sour creaminess. Definitely ate our fill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=120
Triplet C.,"Walnut, CA",64,10,5,3.0,7/28/2017,I was disappointed with their Asian cuisine dishes. I ordered the spicy cashew chicken and it's more like teriyaki chicken. It was soaked with sauce and very salty. There wasn't a single cashew nut which I was expecting. The dish should have some vegetables and none was present. My dinner was very unsatisfactory except for the  waitress which she was really nice. I rather go to elephant bar but there's none around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=120
David B.,"Whittier, CA",20,6,5,2.0,1/16/2017,"Very disappointed.

Hannah K.,"La Habra, CA",448,33,5,3.0,10/8/2016,"Say no to banana cream cheesecake.  Generally overpriced, but tasty-ish food. I had Renee's Special with Loaded Baked Potato soup and a turkey sandwich. I'm a fan of rosemary, but there was too much in the soup and the best part of the sandwich was the slice of tomato inside! My husband got the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken which is his go-to (tasty but a little dry).  We got the banana cream cheesecake for dessert which is a plain cheesecake topped with a layer of banana cream, topped with banana slices and whipped cream. The banana cream had a gritty texture and it tasted of artificial banana flavor. Husband commented that it was like eating a banana Now & Later.

Daniela A.,"Oakley, CA",0,11,7,5.0,2/12/2017,"By far the best dining experience we've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. My boyfriend and I came on a Friday night around 6:30, right in the middle of rush hour. We were told it was going to be 40 min wait and we were sure that the hostess was being ambitious with that wait time compared to all of the people still waiting. But we actually were sat before our forty minute wait! Very impressed. Our server Roxie was hands down phenomenal. She brought our bread basket to the table when she first came to us to take our drink orders. Ah! Wish all Cheesecake restaurant servers did that. Our food came out quick and as perfect as could be. She was amazing with our drink refills and took excellent care of us on this busy night. 5/5 for this Cheesecake location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=120

Nicole J.,"Orange, CA",195,17,4,5.0,7/12/2017,"Nicole at the to-go counter is extremely professional, caring, and kind. When doordash' system was down, Nicole made sure to get in touch with me and make sure that she would take care of my order until someone got there- (It took 3 hours for doordash to get in touch with me from the time I placed the order). I really appreciate a good server when I come in contact with one, since I used to be in the food service as well. I know how hard it is for such a big restaurant to stay on top of everything, but Nicole definitely satisfied everything I needed, and still managed to keep my pizza warm when I eventually got it..

Matt L.,"Lakewood, CA",128,17,4,1.0,6/2/2017,Absolutely worst dining experience ever. So the dish I ordered was missing half the menu listed ingredients. But they did over compensate with burnt pepperoni and hair. Tasted like a day old dominos pizza that I ordered at midnight the night before. Just literally came home and threw up. Absolutely disgusting. Oh yea and I also had to was my arm off after the server dropped used silverware on me and didn't bring extra napkins or anything. Then a different server dropped a plate on me and didn't even acknowledge it. This place should be shut down for the worst possible food and service and the biggest cluster fuck in management I've ever seen.

Ed M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,82,214,4.0,7/11/2016,Clean restaurant. Excellent server. Great selection in the menu. The only complaint is the Loud music. If they would bring it down a bit then it would be a great place to chat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=120
Maria T.,"Anaheim, CA",53,3,1,4.0,1/5/2017,"Only reason this restaurant is four stars and not five is because of the 45 minute wait on a Wednesday night.  Everything else was absolutely perfect. The restaurant gives of a caesars palace vibe which is perfect for any formal dinner or celebration. From the beginning, the food exceeded my expectations with the soft,warm, and tasty bread that was served while waiting for our meals. This place has a VARIETY of food like no other. American, Italian, Seafood, Vegetarian, a little bit of Latin and Asian. Also I was pleased to find a separate menu just for slim eaters, and the items on it appeared tasty.

Honest R.,"Anaheim, CA",2,46,8,2.0,9/23/2016,"This chain is in a downward spiral.  The factory nachos came out burned and rock hard so they were sent back. After getting someone else's nachos, which were super cold, our second batch came out rock hard and burned again (although slightly less). I'm really not sure what is going on with the chips, but don't get the nachos. It's the same at other locations too.  The other items were just ok. Not up to their usual standards. At least the portions are still the same I guess. You go to chain restaurants because you know what to expect, right? Well, the only thing to expect now is subpar food.

Brigitte O.,"Yorba Linda, CA",274,474,2248,4.0,7/23/2015,"Love the lettuce cups! Comes with cucumbers, carrots, bean sprouts, chicken, cilantro, peanuts, and three sauces to pour on your self made creations. This is technically an appetizer meant to split among several people but if you eat it yourself it constitutes a hearty meal.  The burgers are surprisingly good here.  Beware the dark bread and butter pats. It is very easy to polish off more than you planned especially it is busy and your meal takes a while to come out.  The cheesecake? I haven't been the biggest fan. We used to make cheesecake homemade when I was little and so the cheesecake here is too sugary to me. On more than one occasion I've been excited to try a new flavor only to eat less than half and not want any more than that. Thankfully I shared on all those occasions and the other person was more than happy to eat more than half ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=120

The wait time can be long depending on when you go, ie dinner time on a weekend or and time in the evening when graduation is near.

T W.,"Long Beach, CA",0,12,,3.0,1/8/2018,"The staff is literally awesome to be able to work through crowds that gather in the lobby around the desert and pick-up area.

Absolutely delicious and worth the carbs. For my entree, I got the four cheese pasta. This is my favorite. Nice, tart marinara sauce with cool, creamy cheese. The pepper was el dente and sauce was delicious. Ordered it with chicken for some protein. For my cheesecake, I ordered the tiramisu. I love their tiramisu cheesecake. Not too sweet and it taste like tiramisu. However, the surprise of the evening was the birthday celebration cake. I did not expect to like the new cheesecake so much. It was really good.

My husband was very upset and just wanted to go back home. Cheesecake Factory was just across the way, but it was dinner and the restaurant looked busy, so his concern was that it was a school night for our kids and the wait would probably be long. After some convincing we walked over and indeed very busy--long wait. But since we dine there often, I recognized the Restaurant Manager and pulled her aside explained the situation and asked if there was anything she could do to help. She was so warm and receptive. She checked the floor and had us seated in less than 5 minutes. She saved the day! The Birthday Celebration back on track.  Our server Jaime was AMAZING!!!

CF's Ad on Insta worked and enticed me to go O_o. We went on a week night 8:30pm, and it was very busy. That's a good sign! We asked for a table for 2 and told us the wait was only going to be 5 minutes. They offered bar seating and we said no. They gave us a buzzer/pager thing and we waited for 15 minutes. Not a big deal. We were not in a hurry, but what annoyed me was after the pager vibrated, we went back in and they didn't have a table for us.They offered bar seating again, which we already declined in the beginning! They apologized and gave us another buzzer and waited for another 10 minutes.  At the table, our server was very nice. I liked that she made lil conversations and even teased me a bit about how much I love their MOLASSES BREAD ^_^. (sooo good!). It was going great until she messed up El hubby's order. She put in the wrong one. Awww man...I got my food and we had to wait for 15 minutes for his food to come. It also didn't help that we were seated next to a large group of loud teens. Siiiigghh.... As for the food, it was delicious. I tried their KALE and SALMON SALAD. Sooo good, healthy and filling. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the salad had the right amount of dressing. El Hubby had their FRIED SHRIMP with coleslaw and french fries. Perfectly cooked and seasoned shrimp! Yum! We also had their CALAMARI. It needed more salt. Probably wont get it next time.

First I got there right on time, and called the number posted there for curbside pickup but no answer. After waiting fora bit I walked in (which I don't mind doing but what's the point of offering curbside pickup). I was surprised by the amount of $41.38 but since my wife ordered I figured she got more than the 2 entrees we planned on. Unfortunately it was just the 2 ""specials"" and 1 slice of cheesecake. As you can see from my photos I was flabbergasted at the price of $15.95 for the miso salmon, $13.95 for pasta with sausage and $8.50 for 1 slice of cheesecake ( more like whipped cream w cheesecake on the side) lol. Those prices I could understand at the right portion but seriously both entrees looked half eaten (the full price dinner price is $17.50) looks like we got half the portion for $3 off. The online menu I found had cheesecake priced $6.95 to $7.95 of course ours is $8.50 (although this might be outdated) still the slices are clearly cut in 1/12 which places a full cheesecake at $102.00 nice.

A pet peeve of mine, are crumbs on the benches. These had many. Tacky. Not to mention we all nearly fractured a tailbone or sphincter muscle, on the thin, hard benches.  The server was nice, the drinks and food good. The skinny shrimp tacos were amazing. The side salad it came with, was nasty, but the Caesar was done well.  I'd return, with its great location, aesthetic decorations, and food selection/quality, but not during an in-between time, and never in a bench!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=160

Jocelyn A.,"Fullerton, CA",4,5,6,2.0,7/24/2016,My friend and I went for dinner last night. We were seated outside upon request. The plates and linen on the table had dirt or dust all over them. Our alcoholic beverages took about 10 minutes to come out to us. The waiter kept going to the other tables around and kept looking at us saying I'll be right back.. Took about 20 minutes just to order food and then the food took about 40 minutes. A table that arrived half an hour after we did received their food before we did. And to top it all off the presentation of the plate was not up to par. There were sauce marks around the edges and some of the shrimp looked like they were just throw on the plate.

Alex G.,"Placentia, CA",4,141,21,1.0,7/14/2017,"Curbside to go! What a joke! Ordered our food over the phone and was told 25 minutes. We arrived at the 20 minute mark, called in and waited 10 minutes before someone came out. When the person arrived at the vehicle he was carrying only my cheesecakes. He then gave us the bill and charged us for our order. He stated you order will be out in about 5 minutes and then asked if we would like some water while we waited. We thanked him and said yes to the water. 20 minutes later our order was finally brought out but, the water that waiter agreed to bring never showed up. At this point our cheesecakes, which are supposed to be refrigerated, have now been sitting out for about 20 minutes. My first question/issue is, why would you bring my cheesecake out 20 minutes before my food? My second issue is the excessive wait, I could have gone in, sat down, ordered and finished eating in the hour plus it took to finally get what we ordered. We now drive home, start eating and find that my four cheese pasta is SALTY and has only 2 tiny pieces of chicken. When I ask for chicken to be added to my order and pay 3-4 dollars extra, I expect at least a small breast. There must be a chicken shortage going on that I'm not aware of.

Ok I thought.....but having tried several other Cheesecake Factories all over the place, I had a horrible feeling there was going to be a long lunchtime wait with the lobby area packed and flowing all the way outside the door. But to my surprise, no, not at all. I did show up at around 11.45am, and the person I was meeting was going to be late, so I waited till 12.30pm. Still to my surprise, there was hardly a crowd all this time. Sure, it got a bit busier after noon with people slowly trickling in, and the large mall parking lot was starting to fill up too....there's plenty of parking, but the later you come, a little further away you'll have to park and walk. When you first walk in to this Cheesecake Factory, you can immediately tell that it's so Cheesecake decor.....very nice, clean, and impressive. So, we had no wait at all and were seated right away by the nice and friendly hostess. We were already familiar with the menu and I pretty much knew what I was going to order. Whatever it was it had to include the Avocado Egg Rolls....yum! I ordered the Pear & Endive salad.....and as usual it was very good....perhaps a little skimpy on the chicken, but it still tasted good, and the portion was extremely generous.....as usual. Everything was delicious...including the free bread...hot and fresh out of the oven. I'm truly impressed at how consistent they maintain their quality at all the CF outlets. Our waitress was friendly and attentive....nice ambiance....very good food. I'm not sure how often I'd come back to this area, but if I do I'd definitely come back to this CF. Oh, there was a table nearby with a birthday celebration....the servers did their birthday song routine, but it was kind of out of tune.....as fun as it may be, I'd pass on that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=160
Carissa J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1144,196,2846,4.0,8/15/2014,"I now come here for the cheesecake and ONLY the cheesecake. I was on a mission to try every single one of their cheesecakes to find out which one I liked the most; I got about half way through their cheesecake menu and fell in love with the ""30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake"" and the ""Godiva Chocolate"". I will eat these two flavors until I get sick of them and then continue on with the rest of my cheesecake mission. The ""30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake"" is made with layers of original cheesecake, fudge cake and chocolate truffle cream, while the ""Godiva Chocolate"" is made with layers of flourless Godiva chocolate cake, Godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse. The cheesecake here is rich, creamy and can be very, very sweet (depending on the flavor you order). Your wallet and scale will not be happy, but indulging yourself in delicious cheesecake is worth it! I have dined in several times for brunch, lunch and dinner at this location, but have yet to find an entree that is worth ordering more than once. They have a large menu selection, so it is a great restaurant for picky eaters or those unsure of what they feel like eating. Although the food portions are large, the food is mediocre and priced higher than it should be. I do enjoy the complimentary bread and butter that they give before your food arrives! The servers here are friendly and help to make your dining experience more enjoyable. Hopefully I can find an entree that is worth coming back for, but if not, a slice or two of cheesecake will suffice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=160

Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,4.0,4/7/2015,"I met up with two of my friends for dinner at The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) recently on a Sunday around 6:30 p.m. For a regular March evening, the eatery was pretty crowded--more crowded than I had expected--but the hostess told me that the wait for three was only 15-20 minutes. I got my buzzer and waited for my friends, who came later, but it worked find because I think we ended up waiting about 25 minutes total.   We were quickly ushered to our table once our turn came to be seated, but I was grateful for one of the booths toward the back of the restaurant -- away from the loud hustle and bustle of the front. Our server was friendly enough, asking for our drink orders and bringing bread right away. She didn't check up on us too much throughout the evening--only once right after our meals came (we hardly had the chance to dig in and maybe one more for drink refills--but we didn't really see her again until we were ready for our check. However, we were really wrapped up in our conversation anyway, so it was fine not to be bothered.   I usually get the ""Grilled Cheese"" sandwich (that's no longer on the menu) or the ""Macaroni and Cheese Burger"" (one of the Glamburgers), but I felt like trying something different. My two friends hadn't been to TCF for dinner in a while, too, so it was a night for us to try entrees that were different from our usuals.   I was pleased with my sando and would definitely order it again. Despite the restaurant feeling busy, we had a great leisurely dinner and didn't feel like we were being rushed out of there. This is still one of my favorite CF locations ... definitely a convenient place to hit up if you're ever in the Brea/Fullerton area.   Here's what we got:   ""Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich"": I love crispy chicken (though grilled chicken is healthier), and I love the slight spice from buffalo sauce, so this sandwich was right up my alley. It featured crispy coated chicken breast covered in melted cheese and your choice of spicy buffalo or chipotle mayo sauce. It was served on a brioche bun and accompanied by French Fries or a green salad. I asked our server if the buffalo sauce was really spicy, and she reassured me that it wasn't and that she preferred that sauce. I was so glad that I ordered it! The sauce had a slight kick, but it was definitely fine for me to handle and I didn't feel like my mouth was burning for the entire evening. I didn't touch the onion and tomato that also came with my sandwich; it had enough flavor in of itself. I also opted for French fries ... I love the fries from TCF because they're thicker and always well-salted! The chicken's interior was tender and soft, and I enjoyed the sufficiently crispy exterior. Since I had a huge lunch, I ate half my sandwich--but downed all of my fries--and savored each and every bite.   ""Veggie Burger"": My friend's a vegetarian but had never tried the veggie burger, so she decided to give TCF's version a go. This ""burger"" was made with brown rice, farro, couscous, mushrooms, black beans and onions. It came on a toasted bun with melted Fontina cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and mayo. My friend took the onion out of her ""burger,"" but said that the combo was actually very good. She especially liked the blend of the brown rice, couscous and melted cheese (gotta love that Fontina). She also ordered her meal with fries and said she would definitely order it again. Like me, she's a sucker for those addictive fries from TCF.   ""California Omelette"": My friend's husband felt like ordering breakfast for dinner, so he opted for one of the omelettes. This one came with avocado, mushrooms, green onions, tomatoes, garlic, shallots, sour cream and Jack and Swiss cheeses. It also came with a choice of starch (I believe), so he opted for toast (instead of potatoes, which is what I would have ordered). The omelette was a decent size and it came with four halves of toast (so two pieces of toast cut in half). My friend's hubby said the omelette was delicious--it sported lots of gooey, melted cheese, and he liked the flavors and textures from the mushrooms, garlic and avocado. This isn't an omelette I would order personally because there are too many ingredients that I don't like, but it's a good option for those who love avocados and mushrooms (there are plenty of other omelettes I would choose instead, if I felt like ordering breakfast for dinner).   ""Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake"": I ALWAYS have to get cheesecake if I'm dining at this place--no matter how full I am--so I ordered a cheesecake to go. I always debate between the ""Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake"" or ""Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple,"" but the Reese's version won out on this particular trip. I love both cheesecakes, but I was just craving those peanut butter cups. This cheesecake features chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups in the ""Original"" cheesecake, with layers of moist, delicious fudge cake and caramel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=220

Natasha P.,"Fullerton, CA",3,60,4,5.0,5/9/2017,"My family of four has frequented Cheesecake Factory for many, many years. It's down the street from us, has a great menu that satisfies everyone, and has easy parking. We've sat on the patio and inside; both are great. My only qualm about seating is that sometimes the tables are so close to one another that you feel that you're on a date with another couple! The Vegan Cobb Salad is ridiculously good, but Louisiana Chicken Pasta is where it's at. It's massive, so I always have enough to take home for breakfast and lunch the next day. But the most important part of this review is the service...River was our server on Sunday night and he was just absolutely fantastic. He's been our server before, but he was extra awesome on Sunday. As soon as he started talking, I felt like he was at Disneyland. Perky, attentive, and great customer service. He also said some really nice words to my family as we were getting ready to leave, and it made all the difference. I'll do my best to sit in his area next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=240

Went in said party of 11 and they said the wait was 50 minutes and it wasn't even busy. So all of my party was there we went into the bar and got some drinks and appetizers. Our buzzer went off at 1hr 10minutes. We all got up and took our drinks with us. Then they tell us that our table is still not ready. They make us stand there with our cold drinks all 11 of us in the walkway for 10 minutes. We finally sit down! The table is sticky. We asked the bus boy twice to wipe it down and he never came back. Finally the waitress had to wipe it down quickly for us. We ordered and got our food. Then, everyone's food was mildly warm and just mediocre. For $20 a plate I expect the food to be atleast hot or decent... My orange chicken was super dry. Finally the desert comes for my sisters bday. It's a tiny wine glass with a scoop of something chocolate and all whipped cream on top. She finished it all in 3 bites. The bill comes and she puts her 18% tip on there as well.

Nidia S.,"Winooski, VT",144,29,47,3.0,1/25/2015,"I always feel like this place can be a hit or miss.  So typically the wait time for this particular Cheesecake is always long so make sure to get there early, especially on a weekend. Also there isn't much seating if you have to wait so be prepared to stand.  Okay here's my thought on the food: it is delicious and always well made but unfortunately the service here stinks! Terrible service.  It took us an hour to get our bread. Our waitress kept telling us she would bring it and then forget it. We finally got it when our main entrees came out so what was the point ? I know the menu is huge with lots of options but here is what I got: If you are looking to be healthy start off with the Kale Salad (small plate). It was absolutely delicious. The kale was fresh and was lightly drenched in an amazing salad dressing.  Main dish: Katsu Chicken. It was a tad bit spicy so if you don't like spicy beware. The breaded chicken and rice tasted delicious. I got my white rice switched out for brown rice. The meal comes with a creamy hot (spicy) sauce with pairs well with the chicken, rice and veggies. No need for Sriracha.  Dessert: The RED VELVET CHEESECAKE is a must! It totally made up for the terrible and slow service. The cheesecake was absolutely delicious. It was so smooth and not dry. The texture was very moist. Great cheesecake with very fresh coffee. This is the best cheesecake type in my opinion. You will not be disappointed   This place is great. I just wish the service was better. When my party had our food we realized they brought everyone's plate but our waitress forgot my Dads plate. He had to sit there for her to find his food. She also took forever to get our check (over 20 minutes).

It was a Saturday night and we had a party of six, including my toddler. There was a 45 minute wait that ended up taking more like an hour (at least it felt that way). The place seemed chaotic near the host desk. I was not expecting to have a pleasant dinner. But then we were seated, the host apologized for the wait (even though he had nothing to apologize for, the crowd there was insane). The waiter came right away, took our drink order, brought bread, and soon after took our order. To my surprise (and delight) he offered to bring the kids (my 1 1/2 year old and my 11 year old nephew) their food right away. YES PLEASE! That was our saving grace.  He continued to surprise us with quality service (something I didn't expect on such a busy night) and he never seemed overwhelmed with the crowd. None of the service did, in fact. They were so calm, I barely noticed how busy the restaurant was.  The kids were happy, we were happy, the food was great. They even have a ""low calorie"" menu which I ordered from. Delicious.

If you go to this restaurant for lunch or dinner and you want to enjoy a meal + a dessert, I really recommend you to order a small meal to be hungry for the cheesecake because otherwise you wont have the chance to eat the best dessert ever ! I order a small plate called ""Fresh basil, tomato and cheese flatbread"" for $6. It was perfect because after I was hungry enough to eat my favorite cheesecake : the original !! (I ordered it with strawberries toppings , it is called Fresh strawberry cheesecake) for $7-$8. Another thing to know is that it is a very fat dessert, very high in calories, so after eating only 1 cheesecake (without meal), you will feel completely full!!

We knew what we wanted so we ordered right away. It was a while and still were waiting for our food. Our waiter said he would try to speed up the salad. We ordered Fried Zuccini and an Asian Salad. About 5 minutes later, people who were seated 5 minutes after us got their salad, same as ours. The people next to us, seated after us, got their Pizza!. The table behind that was seated about 10 minutes after us got their burgers and apps, including zuccini.  We still sat with no food. Our salad came out, no zuccini. Then our zuccini.

There was a table in the shade next to us, so we asked to move. The server said she could try to move us inside, as the one table in the shade, that had been vacant since we sat down, might be taken. She was gone about 5-10 minutes, during which time the before mentioned table was untouched ( there were also the shady tables we saw when we walked up, but we were told that they weren't currently seating anyone at those tables.).

The reordered meal had tough chewy shrimp and the tips of my asparagus were cut off. I just had asparagus stems. Wow!!! I will never eat there again. I am advising everyone to stay clear of this particular Cheesecake Factory unless you like eating shrimp with poop still in it. I also told the hostess as she showed us our table that it was my daughters birthday.  She nodded her head and said ok and that was it. Love the Cheesecake Factory but this location you should skip.

(closing out check)  once finished and presented with my bill , i promptly handed my visa card to my server isela v. in attempt to leave quickly.  after receiving my receipt i noticed i was double charged for my child's corn dogs ( the one which was improperly cooked). after noticing this i personally walked up to my sever and informed her of yet another mistake of the over charge.  isela v. then related this was a mistake mad by her manager (derek beck).  at this time i followed my server to her manager in order to have the error corrected. upon contacting the manager - it seemed as though he did not know of any of the mishaps which started from the moment i entered your restaurant.  this is when he finally asked about the whole experience did he seem to have concern( also due to the fact i was asking for contact information for the corporate offices). i feel it is not the customers responsibility to bring up any inconsistencies with the restaurant experience.  if i was approached : upon being denied patio seating, not receiving my beer and having to ask for it a second time, my child's food not being properly cooked, and being overcharged for my order, then possibly further mishaps could have been avoided. 5. fixing the over charge.  this was possibly the most uncomfortable experience off all. my initial charge with the over charge was -$97.52.  the manager told me that in order to fix the over charge he would have to run my visa card a second time.  he stated that first charge would not go though but would have to run the card again for the corrected amount of $93.20.  prior to this second transaction i used my smart phone to access my online banking which showed the first charge of $97.52 already pending.  the manager derek beck told me he had to charge my card again and this was my only option.  so i did the secondary charge of $93.20.  after both charges i then had a total of $190.72 pending.  this is unacceptable. the customer should not be bering the burden of a dining experience.          after further conversation with your manager about my discomfort - a $25 gift card was given to me to hopefully smooth over wrong doings.  really? a $25 gift card when you have over $190 of my money pending?  this has left a bad taste in my mouth. from beginning to end i feel your restaurant staff at the brea ca cheesecake factory -failed as a team hospitality staff = fail / did not accommodate to requested patio seating server / bar = unaware of errors with drinks orders not being delivered.  and not checking bills for errors prior to charging guests. bartender not noticing a drink order sitting on there bar top not being delivered. kitchen = fail not properly cooking a child's meal.  corn dog with batter inside and hot dog cold to touch. management = fail not stopping by a table to check with such errors as beer/and food orders. and not taking off the overcharge of the second corn dog order. having the customer to walk up to the manager to have errors fixed and having the guest ask for management information and corporate numbers instead of offering this information. this will not stop me from coming back to the cheesecake factory but has and will make me think twice if this is were i really want to eat at again. hopefully i will not be double charged for both charges that are pending and this can be where it ends. hopefully your company will read this and stop this from occurring again. j. ortiz",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=300

Mona A.,"La Mirada, CA",112,121,399,5.0,4/13/2015,"fourth time at a cheesecake factory, and i must say this location by far is the best.  When i walked in i was greeted by 5 people at once, all very nice young employees. The lady at the stand asked hkw many and i told her 5 for my youngest sister's bday. she quickly sat us and asked for my sisters name. and the location was pretty full housed. maybe only 6 areas open. and about a total of 7 groups outside sitting for dinner.  i my family and i sat at our table and were quickly greeted by another smiling face George our waiter. we explained the 5th person was on her way. so he came back with waters foreceryone and said let me know when you're ready. very kind gentleman and excellent service.  the group finally became 5 and we then placed appetizers first... my crusted macaroni balls yummmmmy and roasted asparagus.. after we all placed our entree orders. George was very honest of what to order asked what we liked in flavor and what we didn't. we all ordered based off his recommendations.  as we waited he made sure our fresh bread basket was never empty. food overall was well worth every penny spent.. my Chicken Romano parmesan crusted entree was AMAZING. everyone enjoyed their plates and George serious was one of the accomodating waiters by far.  i believe weekdays are better then the weekends because the service is 200x's better and its not over crowded.  that and just Brea location has a better staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=300
Jasmin M.,"Long Beach, CA",120,32,8,1.0,8/8/2015,"My friend and I came to dinner after stopping by at bjs for a drink. We got sat, the server finally got to our table and took a while for our drinks. I get it, were 2 girls ( I'm a sever, this means 2 girls is less priority than your 4-top) but the fact that Christopher ( is what the check stub said) never came back to check on us is crappy service, and everything came out wrong. Yet he could check on the table, literally right next to us. He was obviously avoiding us.  We then stopped a runner to call for a manager because ""Chris"" never came back. Complained to the manager Veronica. She was really polite, apologized for the mistake. However, the manager then tried to blame the runner, as if it was her fault it came out wrong. Then she explained that Chris was busy that's why he never checked on us. But he checked on the table next to us? All around. The experience was not good. Service was horrible. Food didn't even come how we ordered it. And the management obviously didn't care enough to take care of the problem. And the table next to us agreed, they however, got checked on numerous times and had an OK time.     Next time, go to to bjs.

Glen M.,"El Segundo, CA",63,312,580,4.0,3/20/2015,"Really good food but if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, be ready to wait. We got there early (so we thought) at 5:30pm and had a 30 minute wait. They don't take reservations because there's always enough people to fill the place.  Their menu is probably 20 pages but half of it is advertising. They added a number of combo plates (pick two) and many of us decided it looked good. However, for most of us, it was disappointing. If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory in the past, you get used to fairly large portions. These combos were smaller than expected, especially for the price. Maybe they are now downsizing their portions but for us, as mentioned, it was disappointing.  Service was good however we did have to flag down the wait staff more than once for refills on our drinks (we may have had a newer waitress as our orders also came out in waves and two of us were waiting four minutes for meals while others at our table were eating).  But, really, overall, nothing said will impact their popularity. The place is almost always packed and their food is usually very good. We just had one of those less than stellar experiences. I'm sure our group will choose to go back again one day but the next time we're in Brea, we may try one of the other places in that same area.

For the appetizer, I decided to try out the Sweet Corn Tamale Cake and it was very interesting..lol The consistency was kind of mushy ? Like mashed potatoes, and personally I loved the avocados on the dish, but my boyfriend didn't. Also the presentation was nice, but I'd only recommend this dish if you want to try something new.

A slice of cheesecake is pretty pricey but it IS the CHEESECAKE factory so you have to save room for a slice for yourself or to share.

Thank goodness for my persistent husband who called them directly. The manager opened the restaurant doors a half an hour early just to make sure we got the cakes to our destinations on time! Since we needed the cakes for each of our family's Thanksgiving meals, we were so grateful for the wonderful customer service! I can't say we always receive the same great service from the wait staff when we eat inside the restaurant, but the customer service at the bakery here is always amazing. Each time we've ordered from the bakery, Sonya has helped us. She is always really friendly and even remembers our names. Now that's great service! We've also received wonderful service at curbside when we've ordered food to go. The convenience of having curbside is wonderful for those parents who have kids asleep in the backseat and want food to go. I also love the fact that everyone who brings the food to us is really friendly and helpful.

We both laughed at the situation and called the server over and he took our plates back to the kitchen. The Manager came to our table to apologize and offered free soup or salad. We accepted the offer but it still didn't change the fact that we were hungry and had to wait once again for our food to be properly made with chicken. How does one mess that up?! 15 mins later we receieved our food on the same plate with  the  same side dish of black beans and cilantro rice. You would think for sanitary purposes that Everything would have come out Fresh! It sucks that more wasn't done to alleviate the situation at hand.

Pamela M.,"Brea, CA",459,304,1025,4.0,12/18/2013,"I will never say no to eating at Cheesecake Factory. I don't care if this is a chain restaurant; Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. Their menu is so big, it could feed everyone of any preference. Except maybe vegans.... but they're probably used to that. My favorite item to get at Cheesecake Factory, regardless of location, is the chicken bellagio. It is one of the cheaper specialty items on the menu at around $15. It is a HUGE portion too. Everyone on the menu is a big portion but trust me when I say you'll have enough to take home to feed you for dinner and make you full. It's two big pieces of breaded chicken breast on top of a California king sized bed on pasta (don't know what the sauce is, I forgot) and topped with an arugula salad. It is so good. I literally get this every time I've gone here for the past 5+ years and I haven't gotten sick of eating it. My cheesecake recommendations are the red velvet cheesecake and their anniversary cheesecake. I can't remember exactly what the anniversary one is called, but I know it's in the menu and described something along the lines of their cheesecake to celebrate their many years of success as a restaurant. Look out for it on the menu because it is chocolate cheesecakey goodness. The red velvet cheesecake is bomb diggz. Just trust. Of course Cheesecake Factory is nada without their addicting bread. I personally like the wheat bread most because when paired with butter, it tastes slightly sweet and its so good. It doesn't taste anything like any other wheat breads I've had before. I thought it was like molasses bread or something intricate for the longest time ... but no its just wheat. Their sourdough bread is good too. Best when served piping hot out of the kitchen with loads-a-butta! ""Keep the bread comin'"" is my motto. The service at this location is usually very good, unless they're extremely busy, like it was yesterday when I went. it was lunch time and it's near the holidays ... the place was packed, even to the patio. The waiters had so much to do for so many tables and the kitchen was getting backed up with all the orders. I noticed they had a bunch of large parties too. My waiter this particular visit was very MIA and our food took a whopping total of 40 minutes to come out. The manager came out to apologize to us for the long wait because there were so many large parties, but still. 40 minutes?! Insanity. The food was good nonetheless. Luckily I had no time constraint, otherwise I would've been royally pissed.  I love getting cheesecake for parties and birthdays at their little bakery section. They have all the cheesecakes on the menu for purchase, frozen and ready to thaw in a couple hours. I DO NOT, however, recommend purchasing their customized chocolate plate where they write ""Happy Birthday ____"" on it for you with chocolate because they totally messed up mine. This was supposed to be a nice presentable cake and I feel like the woman that wrote on the plate played around with it and made it look awful. Not to mention, it's pretty pricey to get that plate too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=320

But they are so much more than that. The food before the dessert are tasty as well.  The menu, in fact, is very thick and packed with a large amount of selection from salad, pasta, seafood, steak, rice and all of the between. They offer two types of unlimited bread.  Both of them are delicious especially when they are warm and fresh out of oven.  My favorite dish that I often order (always order) is the Shrimp Scampi.  So good! Love it! Price is fair and I think it is worth splurging with entree and dessert because you gotta make room for the cheesecake.  Save space for cheesecake! I can't do anything too sweet and I find all the special flavor cheesecake can be pretty sweet.  I always would choose the Original.  Sometimes when I like to be fancy, I would ask for Strawberry Cheesecake A La Modé (a scoop of ice cream).

Andrea Y.,"Walnut, CA",419,196,278,5.0,3/23/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has to be my favorite ""American"" chain. I always have a good experience. My friend introduced me to their shrimp and chicken gumbo, and I've been ordering it ever since. IT IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Creamy, spicy, filled with tender chicken breast and chicken and sausage. It is an explosion of rich flavors that goes perfect with the white rice! I also love that rye bread that they serve (meh about sourdough though) at the start of your meal. It's so sweet and soft and so damn good with butter. Is it possible to come to the Cheesecake Factory and just have the Jesus diet? (Jesus diet = complimentary  water and bread....) I also tried my sisters shrimp and sausage pasta (lunch special menu) which was actually surprisingly good and really saucy! I tend to avoid pasta at restaurants because it always tastes bland to me but this one had a lot of flavor. I enjoyed eating her leftovers the next day. Her dish also took a while so they offered her a free loaded potato soup (very nice of them)...and it was also delicious. Tasted like baked potatoes with all the toppings (including bacon and cheese!) but just in a soup form. The BBQ ranch salad and Chinese chicken salad are both spot on too! Really huge portions and lots of dressing. For cheesecake, I always order the red velvet cheesecake. Pure cheesecake can be too cheesy for me but the alternating red velvet cake layers really helped to balance it out. My only gripe with this place is that it's overpriced :/ The menu is also insanely huge too and can confuse and frustrate you (paradox of choice, anyone?).

Diana B.,"Orange County, CA",636,241,561,4.0,3/27/2015,"I've been pleasantly surprised with my recent visits to the Cheesecake Factory. This wasn't my go to restaurant, but I'm starting to like it more and more after each visit.  Service: there were a lot of people waiting in line as we entered the restaurant so I expected a long wait, but the host told us that we only had to wait about 15 minutes. They gave us a buzzer, which was really confusing because they ended up calling our name instead of using the buzzer to call us back to the host stand.  Tonight, we decided to get: --buffalo blast: a twist on your traditional buffalo wing appetizer. We were expecting to get just wings, but instead, we got a plateful for large fried chicken. Once you cut into it, the shredded chicken is coated with some light buffalo sauce. On the side, there's blue cheese and buffalo sauce, with celery. The blue cheese was a little strong for me but the dish itself was delicious. --chicken Madeira: had to get this because it was the most mentioned dish on Yelp. Even the description says ""our most popular chicken dish"" so I knew I had to try. The sauce is somewhat tangy, which compliments the melted cheese on top of the chicken. The thoroughly cooked asparagus and sautéed mushrooms adds a light touch to the heavier dish. The side mash potatoes was delicious as well.  --hibachi steak: I definitely think this is underrated. When I tried a piece of this, my tastebuds exploded. The meat was so juicy and lightly seasoned. What put it over the top was the slight hint of wasabi in the mashed potatoes, which pulled the entire dish together. There's also deep fried asparagus on the dish as well.

It took 15 minutes to get us drinks, didn't even offer us water. The food took forever. My sister and her husband ordered a salad before their meal that never came. One the food finally came, they forgot to put it my salad, I assume, it took another 15 minutes for them to bring my salad, meanwhile all of my family was half way eating. I was talking to my niece and when I turned away the waiter had taken my salad and placed more plates on top of it. I wasn't even done eating!! Rude rude rude!

I had ordered a steak; well-done, and was absolutely delicious, best steak ever.  My friends were really proud of what they had ordered (chicken fried steak and bacon macaroni burger). My friends absolutely fell in love with their meal, stating it was better than our last time. As for me, I'm definitely coming back tomorrow.  I had ordered a Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple cheesecake. My mouth watered like a waterfall. It was delicious. I couldn't stop talking about it.  Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, and was very quick on if we needed more napkins, ranch, or sauce. Amazing.  I bought more cheesecake home for my family and they absolutely enjoyed it.

The lady on the phone was a bit rude when I was asking for an average wait time but once we got there, the wait was only about 10 minutes and we got seated quickly. We were placed in a extremely dim part of the restaurant, but I guess you could say the rest of the restaurant was dimly lit to uphold the classy atmosphere which I appreciated. However, the light was so dim I had to squint and stick my face into the menu in order to read it. Ordering drinks, we asked for a round of waters, with myself asking for a Shirley Temple as well. Turns out I didn't get that water and had to ask again for it. The menu, is too darn long. I think if they split the menu up into different menus according to the different services, the menu wouldn't be so large and daunting. It was extremely hard to choose what to eat as waitresses never give you enough time to really look at your menu. I got their pasta, as I love pasta, but I was a bit disappointing with my pasta looking like a brown gold pile of pasta with mushrooms and chicken. Yes the pasta was delicious, but I honestly was hoping for something that looked a bit more appealing. I couldn't finish the dish, so our server took my plate and boxed and bagged my food to take home with me.

The rice was so good and the salmon cooked well but wth?! around the salmon and rice they have a white sauce with small circles of teriyaki-like sauce surrounding the entire dish. The sauce was sweet and it did not go with the salmon at all. Not too sure what they were thinking pairing the sauces together. My friend also got the miso salmon and we both thought it was so gross. Can't believe I spent $20 on that crap but at least I had a gift card. It made me really really really super duper appreciate salmon from California Fish Grill. I wish I got anything else... Nothing could have tasted worse than the salmon and sauce combo.  One stars for the friendly service from our waitress.

Whenever we're at the Brea Mall, this is one of a couple places we like to dine in. The place is spacious (over 300 maximum capacity, I looked lol) they have indoor and outdoor seating. The decor is very elegant and with the high vaulted ceiling, it's a really nice place to eat. Here's the rundown:  Miso Salmon - They have this dish down pat. And for some reason, this location makes it the best. I always get the lunch size portion, which is already a big portion. I can't imagine what the dinner portion would be. I can barely finish the lunch portions. lol. The fish is cooked perfectly. The miso glaze is just amazing. It comes on a a huge bed of rice. Yum! The sauce that surrounds the rice is just delicious! A perfect dish in my book!! Marhgarita Pizza and  Caesar Salad (Lunch Pizza and Salad - Special) - It was a dollar more to get the Caesar salad, but it was worth it. The pizza was a nice sized, heck it's probably good for 2 maybe 3 people and it was good. Yum! Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Kids Menu) - This one came with fries and a drink (milk for the boy). The grilled cheese was very good and it was also a big portion. Yum. We requested the fries cooked well done and they complied, Yum.  The complimentary bread was awesome!! Specially the wheat. DELICIOUS!! Service has been always good here. Regarding the Cheesecake, we didn't have any this time (so full). But my favorites are the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Macadamia Cheesecake. You can't go wrong with either of them. This location has a little cheesecake shop inside. You can order a to go cheesecake there. And during the holidays, they also set up a table where you can get gift cards. Their current promotion, get a gift card, get a free slice of cheesecake. Win Win. Parking: I have an issue with them on that. Since it's the holiday season and they are outside of the mall. You have to park where the mall people park. Why, because their Valet closed off 4 rows of parking. That's BS in my book. There were 4 rows of empty parking spots when we got there and we could not use them. We had to park with the general population peeps. No Bueno. Aside from that, I really like coming here for brunch. You get a good meal, good service and the cheesecakes are just Delicious!!

Tiramisu: Delicious! Probably my favorite! It isn't as rich, so I ate this a lot faster than the others. Tuxedo: Delicious! Friend-recommended.   Chocolate Raspberry: RICH. Tastes good, BUT I could only have 1 spoon. Kahlua: RICH x 2. If I thought the Chocolate Raspberry was rich, this just surpassed it. Seriously, I could eat 1 spoon at each meal and probably have a single slice last me 3 days.  I still can't believe we spent about $34 on sugar. ANYWAY I think I liked the ones that were less rich simply because I could eat more of it (yes, I'm a glutton).  But I think the rich slices would go a long way if you just order one instead of 4.   I hope to come back and try the other cheesecakes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=340

She was constantly dropping by to check on us, despite the fact they were swamped with customers. All of my friends had a different dish and if I could see what they ordered, I'd describe it to you - too bad I couldn't! Food: We stuffed ourselves silly with wheat bread portions (the brown ones) and man, were they good.. as for the main dish, I ordered a salmon and steak combo ($19.95, no S&H.. ba dum dum..? No? I tried) and it came out pretty good. It was comprised with the salmon (and asparagus) on the left side of the plate, along with a vinegary type sauce underneath the fish. The steak (fillet portions, so they were already cut and rather small) adorned the right side of my plate, and were laid with mushrooms and onions. The two were separated by a line of mashed potatoes straight down the middle. The portion was rather small, and after I finished it, I craved more food. Much sad.

The service was ok, but certainly not of the really friendly helpful variety, just more the do the minimum. Two of us ordered glasses of different Pinot Noirs - one was drinkable, but not good, the other was REALLY bad, and was sent back to the bar to be replaced. I blame myself for ordering an inexpensive Pinot on the not good one, but the other one should not even be carried. It's THAT bad. The waiter acted huffy about us sending back the one glass, didn't seem that interested in our opinions. I had a shrimp/white wine sauce sauteed pasta dish, and was really surprised to find the shrimp had a little bit of a coating on them, like a very light breading. Not expected or enjoyed in this type of dish. I didn't dare complain, though, as 2 of my co-workers ended up with Shrimp Scampi that had BREADED and FRIED shrimp with a little sauce and a pile of dry linguine on the plate.

The bacon plate was extremely hot (she was warned) and the bacon very hard and dry. So, we assume that, like the dried out potatoes, they made all this stuff early in the morning and re-heated it. Hmmm. Not really top quality.  Another aggravating thing they do is drop off the plates that contain dry toast or muffins and leave without furnishing butter. When the overworked waitress returns to ask if everything is OK, the toast is cold. How hard is it to just put extra butter on the plates, or, better yet, butter the toast/muffins in the kitchen?

Afterwards, we came to The Cheesecake Factory. I knew a party of 30 would be difficult, and we weren't the only large party, even on a Thursday. But we came in, put our name in, and were seated in less than half an hour. I anticipated much longer, but we got beautiful patio seating under several heat lamps that fended off the cold preceding a forecasted storm coming the next day. The servers were extraordinary. My large group, though stressful, is always joking and smiling, and the two waitresses devoted to our two long sixteen-person tables immediately followed suit. They laughed and joked along with us, while serving us quickly and without a single mistake. I wish I could remember their names, but the only thing I can say is that my server looked like a short haired Rachel Bilson. Obviously I can't speak for all thirty people on the food specifically, but I'll speak for me. Part one: the lemonade. I wasn't feeling boozy so in my search for something virgin I saw the words ""house made"". Best lemonade I've ever had at a restaurant, with a sugar-rimmed glass to boot. Then, appetizers! Spinach artichoke dip. Fried calamari. Both delicious and addictive. Then came my shrimp scampi. I always get the shrimp scampi. Throw just a twist of lemon juice over the top and you're in garlicky shrimp heaven. And, of course, the cheesecake. My Rachel Bilson inspired waitress suggested the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake. OH MY LORD. Best ending to a meal I've had in a long time.

The hostess gave the person behind us a buzzer first, but she apologized for the mistake afterwards. About 30 minutes later, we got a table outside. We ordered: - Fish Tacos: Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Crispy Tempura Fish, Avocado, Tomato, Onions, Cilantro and Crema. Served with Black Beans and Rice. $13.95 - Chicken Romano: Breast of Chicken Coated with a Romano-Parmesan Cheese Crust. Served with Pasta in a Light Tomato Sauce. $16.95 - Factory Burger: Charbroiled with Cheddar Cheese, Tomato and Grilled Onions on Sourdough French or Wheat Loaf. Served with French Fries or Green Salad. $12.50 - Tomato Basil Pasta: Grilled Chicken, Fresh Mozzarella, a Touch of Garlic and Penne Pasta. Light and Fresh $14.50 When the waitress took our order, she had repeated it back correctly, but when our food came, it was not exactly as we ordered it. My coworker had ordered his tacos with avocados on the side and I had ordered my salad without dressing. They brought the avocados later but didn't get me a new salad, so I ate the salad with dressing. It was OK, but for the price I expected better.  For dessert, we ordered:  - Lemon meringue cheesecake: Lemon Cream Cheesecake Topped with Layers of Lemon Mousse and Meringue. 25 cents from every slice sold through 7/29/15 will be donated to Feeding America and the 2015 Special Olympics World Games (yay!). $7.95 - Chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake: Layers of Our Fudge Cake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Vanilla Mascarpone Mousse and Chocolate. $7.95 The lemon meringue cheesecake was fabulous. The chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake was very good, but it had more chocolate cake than cheesecake (One of my coworkers really likes chocolate cake, so it was OK). Overall, I felt the service was friendly but not very attentive. (As noted, they made several mistakes, but they were nice about them.) The wait was long, both for a table and for our orders.

Our actual server was nice but I don't understand why there is always a long wait at all hours of the day?! We waited one hour and finally got seated around 9:00PM ish. I think by then you really just want to punch out all your orders: drinks, appetizers and main entree since you waited an hour and they have the menu on display outside.  It's a nice location where you can find parking especially after the mall has closed. I did noticed some people who we were getting impatient with the valet taking a while looking for their cars. We ordered the avocado, portabello, zucchini fries which was small in portions but yummy. My friend ordered the Shepherd's Pie and I can't remember if she thought it would be in an actual pie form. It comes with a large dish and it looks like a mashed potato layer on top. I thought it was okay. It did have flavor and the meat reminded me of chunks of hamburger paddy but at least the gravy had some flavor. My friend loves Jambalaya so he has the past version of it. Big chunks of shrimp and he said it was okay. I went with trying to be healthy with the seared ahi tuna salad. Big chucks that were seared all around well but maybe like 8 pieces. Drink wise we just asked for ginger whisky and you do taste the Jack Daniels. Overall, it's a chill experience and we sat outside on the patio even though it was kinda chilly out. Heat lamps did their job or is it because we sat up against one? We went traditional on dessert and got the strawberry cheesecakes.

Tom I.,"Walnut, CA",46,28,12,4.0,6/14/2014,Pretty much love this place. Nothing but positive experiences. EXCEPT for today. It wasn't really that bad. The Hostess didn't seem too friendly or even personable to my Dad who was listing our party etc. She could have just been having a bad day. Oh well not my problem. Im just here for to eat. We sat down at some tables instead of a booth where we usually sit. It was a little different. Being out in the open and people staring at you like your the only black guy in the cheesecake factory...oh wait...(skin check)  Nevermind. Now where was I? Oh ya So we sat down and we waited and waited for for someone to greet us and take drink orders water bread and such. So we waited for like 5 mins. Then a couple seats to our left. They get served. Two ladies sit to my right and they get bread and served.( DONT WORRY THE RACE CARD IS STAYING IN THE WALLET) LOL JK.  My mom jokingly said to the two ladies next to us we haven't been served and they felt so bad they offered us some bread like we were homeless. We kindly declined flagged down another hostess and she was Very nice and got someone right away. The food was bomb as Always. Can't complain. I had the fried shrimp platter (Cheat day) and it was good. I also have a Peanut butter cheesecake currently on the green mile of my fridge and shall be dealt with a little later tonight. Overall great experience. Love it here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=440

C A.,"Irvine, CA",1,24,18,1.0,3/16/2016,"WORST Cheesecake Factory location! Every single time I come here, the service is terrible. My food comes out cold, or wrong. I typically get either filet (medium rare) or a sandwich (w/no mayo) and 10/10 times, my sandwich has mayo & my steak is cooked well-done like a piece of leather. The servers try to be fancy & appear educated, so they don't write orders down.... Maybe they should! Why do I keep coming here, you ask? Well, it's centrally located & convenient, but honestly I would rather drive to the Cheesecake Factory at the Garden Walk in Anaheim! The service there is top-notch & they're so friendly- unlike this place. Today was the final day that I come here. It took 45 minutes for my sandwich to come out. The server never brought us bread or gave me a refill, and ... Wait for it.... My food came out completely wrong (and cold)... Our server didn't tell us her name, so I can't put her on blast if I wanted to but all she kept saying was ""oh okay sorry"" and then walked away. Wow! I'm a fan of this chain but seriously the Brea location SUCKS!! The hostess/hosts are snobby, the servers are not friendly, the chefs clearly don't know what the heck they're doing & the managers probably obtained a managerial role because of mommy or daddy. Basically, don't come here. 100% of the time I go, my meal is a disaster... And I'm not even picky!!! Get it together brea",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=440
Ivy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,58,24,1.0,2/19/2014,"I was here several weeks ago because I was craving their fried Mac and cheese. I ordered the appetizer when the server took our drink order. It took the server about 7 minutes to bring out our drinks, still no appetizer. The server had to drop off other drinks before returning to our table to take our order about 5 minutes later. After ordering our entrées, we waited about 15 minutes the entrees to arrive, still no appetizer. At this point, 25 minutes had passed since we had ordered our appetizer.  Let's get this straight, we ordered our appetizer with our drinks and still our entrees arrived before the appetizer. I had to flag down the server and inquire about the appetizer because she didn't even stop by to see if our entrees arrived correctly. She looked surprised when I brought it up and asked if we still wanted it. She left to check on it and came back with the response, ""I just checked and the kitchen burnt your first round of fried Mac and Cheese, but they're working on another one. It should be out any moment.""  We actually waited 15 minutes for the appetizer to arrive--totaling in about 40 minutes since we ordered it. By then my boyfriend had already finished his entree and I was too full to actually enjoy the appetizer. To my amazement, she still charged us for the appetizer.  Clearly our server forgot to place the appetizer order. She was surprised when I reminded her about it, and had the audacity to ask if I still wanted it. If the kitchen truly burnt the appetizer, it still would have arrived significantly earlier than our entrees. Had the kitchen also made a mistake, she would have taken the app off our bill. It was her mistake and she didn't want to own up to it. She didn't even apologize. Please don't blame the kitchen for your mistake.

Evelyn V.,"Los Angeles, CA",367,289,567,5.0,1/9/2013,"I am obsessed with the dulce de leche cheesecake, I have written many reviews about it. I just can't get enough of it. This location is pretty nice, not as loud as other ones,the area is pretty quiet. I went on a Sunday at 9:00pm so that may be why. They always bring yummy bread to start off with, white one and some other wheat one. I love the wheat one better, there's so much more flavor. We started off with the chicken croquetes, they were pretty good. A little greasy for my liking. They're very similar to chicken empanadas except these are deep fried instead of baked.  For the entree, we split a chicken madeira (as usual) best way to eat asparagus! grilled and topped in yummy madeira wine sauce. The chicken has melted cheese on top! By the time we were done eating, we had no room for dessert. I took a piece of the dulce de leche cheesecake and I wanted to eat it on the way home but I didn't. I ate it half of it the next day with a hot cup of coffee. Yummm I recommend black coffee for extremely sweet cheesecake. It's a nice balance. Anyway,. this location is nice.

Jason T.,"Los Angeles, CA",286,66,42,3.0,5/1/2016,"Having been to Cheesecake Factory in the past, I know what I was getting into. Coming here the food is normally good and service is ok. Every restaurant has good and bad nights and last night was a bad night. Yes, Saturdays are very busy but I didn't feel I got what I paid for. First, we reminded our waiter for bread and he forgot and had to be reminded again. Second, our food took over 45 mins and our waiter wasn't aware that it was running late until we mentioned it. Third, our waiter was a tad rude on top of being un-attentive. We asked for a substitution for a dish and our waiter obliged, but failed to mention it would be an additional charge while taking away the pasta from the dish. Later when we asked the waiter about it, he tried to rationalize it by saying vegetables are more expensive than pasta. Maybe he was new or doesn't have much experience with customer interaction, but I don't think this was very professional on his part. He could've worded his explanation a lot better and we left The Cheesecake Factory feeling disappointed and with a bad taste in our mouths. Service always trumps food and if a meal is great, but the service is poor you'll feel like it was a waste and that's what we got from The Cheesecake Factory.

She told us she would come back to refill our waters and never did, we had to flag another server down to get us some condiments since she was nowhere to be found, it only bothered us because there were only 3 tables in the bar area at the time where we were seated and we saw her in the corner talking with other servers and then she disappeared .

I ordered a chicken piccata which was cooked with too much oil that made the meal unpleasant. From the very beginning all our appetizer and salad plates we ordered our server forgot to pick up the dishes which made our table cluttered.

A little mango salsa, black beans & rice, fried plantains! O-M-G this is it! I've discovered the best thing on the menu! The small-sized shrimp were spicy and tender, the mango salsa very mild.

What I do know is that I am a mother of a newborn and getting out is very difficult. We were friendly, I didn't expect to have such crappy service from such a normally great restaurant.  We ended up walking out...which is something we've NEVER done. We went to Lazy Dog where we experienced the exceptionally wonderful service we always get. I am not sure if we will ever go back to Cheesecake Factory after tonight. I also wish I would have gotten the waiter's name so this was a direct review of him and not of the restaurant...but that is not possible.

Also, the chicken avocado sandwich came with a pile of lettuce, when the menu (which mentioned tomato) did not list. That really bugs me. If it's something you're going to pile on, say it on the damn menu, so I know to tell you I don't want that on there. The chicken was too lumpy and cumbersome, and just didn't blend with the sandwich. Then the thing that really bugged me was their HORRIBLE FRIES. Truly one of the very worst I've ever had in my life.

I always find the cheesecake amazing-- my personal favorite being the white chocolate raspberry truffle. However, why do they put that much whipping cream? It's not only on the cake but the side too. It's just adding to its deadliness (which I suppose might be why there's two dollops; you're already clogging your arteries anyway so a little more won't hurt). I can never finish a slice by myself (especially after dinner), so it's best to share with someone. The reason I'm posting a review is because I've been to many of them-- SF Union Square, Marina Del Ray, and this one just doesn't seem up to par. Don't get me wrong, the service is outstanding and the atmosphere is great but the food is a little off.

I have tried a lot of the dishes here, and so far the only one I have not cared for was their Orange Chicken. It tasted too much like orange rind to me. Go figure. My ex loved it though, so maybe you will too. Portions are huge (and so are calories) so I usually take half home. -Menu. Lots of variety, and low calorie entree options. Nutritional menu available upon request. -Service: Always professional and friendly, no consistent problems. The bad: The main thing for me would be the calories. If you're watching your weight either come here on a cheat day or (do what I do:) order from the ""Skinnylicious"" menu and take half home for later. Otherwise, dishes are easily over 1000 calories. My favorite orders: Steak Diane and the Factory Chopped Salad.

I used to always go to the Glendale (Americana) location, but ever since I've moved to the OC area, I haven't gone. Today, I came to this location and I was incredibly SO disappointed and shocked at how salty the food was and how horrible the service was.  I basically had 5 different waiters because the first, original waiter never came back to my table and she only came to put down my order and of course give the paycheck. It's like she expected me to tip her for doing absolutely nothing. LOL. It was frustrating trying to get every server's attention because literally no one came to my table. I asked for an extra plate, more bread, and a water refill SO many times and it took literally forever. I had to ask a worker who was cleaning up the table, he wasn't even a server and he seemed to do a better job than the actual waiters. And another thing that bothered me was the first female waiter. She seemed like she looked down on me because she was very rude the short time she served my table and when I asked for more bread she went off to her male waiter friend and pointed at my table and held the bread basket up, and they both chuckled. It was very demeaning and I felt very offended. And the worst part, she never brought me my bread. And so I asked her male waiter friend for more bread and he went off to her and told her and they laughed again. I don't know what was up with those two, but I ended up just leaving because I was just so offended. Never coming back here. Also, the extra plate they gave me was super gross. It had food marks and it was just nasty. Seriously worst experience.  I got the 1. Barbecue ranch chicken salad ($14.95): comes w/ avocado, tomato, grill corn, black beans, cucumber and romaine w/ all tossed with BBQ ranch dressing. Topped w/ thin crispy fried onion rings. It was surprisingly pretty sweet and not the same as before. I was a bit disappointed. The dressing was way too much.  2. Spicy chicken chipotle pasta ($15.95): comes w/ penne pasta, honey glazed chicken, asparagus, red and yellow peppers, peas, garlic and onion in a spicy chipotle Parmesan cream sauce. This was very salty and not as good as I expected. The asparagus was the best part. Overall I'd give this a 1.5/5.  Oh btw, I went around 11:30 AM and I got the lunch size plates and they were both smaller and cheaper!

The sandwich is dense and quite filling, so splitting between your wife or husband is wise with this plate. The experience can make or break a place. Although the brunch was pretty good, the wait upset us. And there were others around us that were unfortunately told the same wait time expectation but we're also waiting longer than expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=100
Cat B.,"Orange County, CA",187,288,617,3.0,9/15/2016,"5 stars for service.  We had the friendliest and most accommodating waitress and wait staff last night. They constantly refilled our bread basket (the kids love the ""chocolate"" bread) and our drinks.  2.5 stars for food. Hubs beef dip was quite good. The bread was soft, the meat tender, and the sandwich was nice and warm. Super comfort food for sure. The kids enjoyed their salmon/rice and fettuccine dishes.  I would have given the food 4 stars but for my jambalaya, which used to be my ""go to"" entree and also happens to be one of their signature dishes. For lack of a better word, it really sucked this time. : ( You could tell they cooked the noodles then plopped them on the plate before adding the chicken & shrimp jambalaya sauce on top. It was also room temperature which means my dish sat under the heat lamp where the noodles had time to clump together.  Once I separated the noodles and stirred the sauce in, my dish was bland. Did they salt the water for the pasta, or add salt to the sauce?  Fortunately, our awesome waitress quickly brought out some more sauce for me to stir into my dish, and after adding some salt, it became more reminiscent of the dish I once loved.  Don't think I'll be ordering this anymore since I also noticed that they really skimped on the serving of shrimps which were small and overcooked. Boo hoo for my lost relationship with CF's jambalaya. It'll take me months to get over this breakup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=100

If you're a fan of the tv show ""Big Bang Theory"", the inside looks nothing like the place Penny worked at, nor are their uniforms yellow. The Brea location is located right on the outskirs of the Brea Mall, on the corner of Brea Boulevard and Brea Mall Way.  While there's plenty of parking, you have to carefully cross a busy mall road to get to the restaurant.  During the day, its easy to cross, but there didn't seem to be much lighting to help at night. We arrived a little after noon on a Sunday, and the wait was estimated at 20 minutes.  We were told that the bar area was open, and also offered the full menu.  We decided to eat there instead, and sat on high table near the bar. and most of the patrons were watching the Vikings vs Seahawks wild card game.  While we were looking through their menu, our server took our drink order and brought a basket of squaw and french bread.  If you have never been to the Cheesecake Factory, the menu is massive. Most of the spiral bound menu is filled with advertisement, but there's pages and pages of food from salads, sandwiches, comfort food, pizza, and every version of chicken and fish you can think of.  Their portions are as big as the menu, also massive, so I was happy to see they had a lunch portion of their more popular food items. I decided on the lunch portion of their popular fish n chips, which came with a side of cole slaw, while Stephen had the falafel salad, which was a mixture of romaine lettuce, kale, feta, pita chips, and a yogurt dressing.  I would not rave about the food as being the best (hey, its a chain) but we left satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=80

I am giving them a better rating only because they took care of my issue. The meatloaf I would rate with no stars. Anyway beware of their Factory Meatloaf.

They say shrimps are pretty much the bugs of the sea, they eat the junks from the oceans. If you think about it, that's pretty gross, but true.  With that being said, I would eat them at Cheesecake Factory. I always order the Shrimp Scampi, I trust having them here because I know they prepare and clean them well. Everything about this place is perfect, customer service is always outstanding. The place is always immaculate. Even the price to me are decent for great foods. So why not five stars? Like I said, I think the price is decent.  The one problem I have is that they are kind of cheap with their pasta portion. With a plate over $20 bucks, you would think they give you a little more. Especially when you know pastas are cheap as hell at the market. Anyway, it's still great, but could've been five stars.

I tried to place a to-go order today, labor day 2017, and first off the phone call intake person hung up on me twice or more because they couldn't hear me because their phone headset wasn't working, either that or the background in the restaurant was too loud. So then I called my brother right after to check it wasn't my phone acting up and he could hear me - my phone was just fine.  Finally I call back and get through and the guys like; ""Hold on, I can't hear you very well, let me use this other phone over here."" And then he picked up the other phone, I told him what I wanted, and then he transferred me to the bakery so I could FINALLY order a little to-go food. Then I was I was placed on hold forever with the bakery and couldnt get through.  This sequence in the last paragraph happened twice.  Eventually I gave up because they obviously didn't care about my business enough to place a small to-go order which I probably would have even tipped on. Oh well.

One of my must haves is their avocado egg rolls. So crisp and velvety all at the same time. texture overload. Oh and that sauce that accompanies it -- sweet and tangy. what a perfect compliment to those eggrolls. Their bread basket is awesome. Simple yet such a butterylicious way to start a meal. And I use lots and lots and lots of butter. Side note, their rib eye is flavorful, marbled goodness.You gotta try it. On a recent visit, I had the chicken madeira and herb crusted salmon comb with mashed potatoes for $19.95. What a freakin rad deal, especially since I spent the first 15 mins agonizing over what I should order. More often than not, I'm usually pulled in a tug of war between two items i really want to try.  Thanks cf for letting me have both. Serving was a nice large portion, tons of mashed potatoes. In fact it acted as a barrier in between the fish (and its butter sauce) and the chicken (and its wine sauce). Both were very good, but I wasn't too fond of the sauce the salmon was sitting in. It was completely drenched that it took a bit away from its texture. Still great though, finished everything. I've tried many many variations of their famous cheesecakes and of course have my favorites. Dulce de leche, tiramisu, white choc mac nut are all fatteningly yummy.

My daughter had the child pasta with butter and Parmesan.  I knew something was wrong when baby girl asked for my food.  The bow tie pasta had a hard texture and seriously lacked flavor.  Had this before way better.  Our server replaced it with spaghetti and marinara.  Baby girl was then happy and gobbled up her food.  We also had to replace her Shirley temple drink.  She said it taste like medicine.  I tasted it and it did taste medicinal.  Because of my server's inexperience we had some trouble getting my cheesecake order right.  I wanted the Chris outrageous cake.

She asked my godfather if he wanted more cranberry juice and he said sure. I felt deceived that she didnt tell us we would be paying for two. Servers should be honest and disclose if there are additional charges or fees. Also, i told her i needed a voided receipt for the wrong check that i paid for. She takes my credit card, charges me for the correct check, makes me wait 10 minutes, then comes back and tells me she cant give me a voided receipt until the other party pays for their bill. I tell her i will wait. Then she goes and takes other tables orders and ignores me for about another 20 minutes before coming to me and giving me the voided receipt. I did not get any compensation for this error or any of my time wasted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=560

Everyone loved their food! The staff is very knowledgable and friendly (I let our waitress know it was someone's bday) they brought out the cheesecake and sang her a happy birthday! Super fun! Now the cheesecake...was interesting. We ordered the red velvet cheesecake. Wasn't a big fan. It was really sweet and decadent. They were both great...by themselves.

Ron V.,"Placentia, CA",0,9,1,2.0,1/19/2016,"So my wife & I went out to for dinner at CF because we've always enjoyed the food. It was pretty busy (Sat eve 1-16-16) so we had to wait around 50 mins. That was fine, but when we were finally called for our table, they asked if ""heated patio"" would be alright. It was a cold evening but we said it was OK because of the heaters. We were led to a table for two on the edge of the patio but our heater was off. (Every other table's heaters were on) I asked if someone could turn it on, but that's when the waitress told us it was broken but we should be fine since the other heaters residual heat would be sufficient. Seeing that we were already seated and we waited for close to an hour, we reluctantly stayed. It was fine for about 15 minutes, but my wife was getting really cold to the point of being uncomfortable. We both had light jackets on but the ""residual heat"" wasn't cutting it. I got up and politely stated our dilemma to a waiter who told me to ask the manager. (who just arrived at the table with our meals) I told him my wife was very cold and uncomfortable without a working heater, but all he said was ""Can I bring you some hot water?"" I didn't know how to respond to that, so I said NO and off he went.  Now i am not one to leave a negative review, especially when the food was delicious and our waitress was prompt and friendly, but I was taken back by the ""hot water"" comment. At least he could have offered us some hot coffee or tea, maybe a dessert & coffee or something to at least make us feel like you are trying to rectify the situation, but ""hot water""?  What were we supposed to do with hot water, soak our hands in it to warm up?

I then looked at the menu and asked for a different dish that I was hoping would at least he edible. 25 min. Later while everyone had finished eating and all plates were cleared I was still sitting there waiting for my dish. I then asked if they could just put the dish in the to go box when it was finally ready. After they brought the dessert my dish was finally ready... a total of 35 min after I had sent my original dish back. Then when we got the bill they charges me for the dish that first was not edible then was brought out as we were ready to go! I then told the manager he could take the food back and to take it off the bill... and he did.

Perfect amount of sauce, for once a place who doesn't drown the enchiladas in sauce, chicken was moist and perfectly cooked plus the side of beans and rice tasted great. In regards to the chipotle chicken pasta that is great also. I could be bias due to the fact of I love chipotle sauce or anything of that sort but the combination of creamy Alfredo but with a little kick from the chipotle sauce makes it a must have everytime you visit. Only cons I have on this location is the seating. I understand it does get busy but where we had been seated the tables were so close together we were practically sitting with the other tables and conversation between the both of us was almost impossible. Overall I would go back in a heartbeat. Giant menu and great atmosphere, with drinks expect about a $35+ bill but it is well worth it.

Japen G.,"Anaheim, CA",182,402,559,4.0,7/11/2012,The menu is still very overwhelming but I am quite impressed with their efforts to provide lighter meals and a good selection for lunch portions. The Lunch Pasta I ordered was the Pasta Carbonara and it was delicious.  I totally enjoyed each bacon filled mouth full of pasta.  But I know my heart wasn't too happy because this pasta was loaded and was just a hearty slop of goodness.  They used a thin noodle pasta almost angel hair pasta.  The pasta had an oil based sauce that was rich in flavor and wasn't creamy.  So when you look at the pasta it looks deceiving because it looks light.  But once you stir the pasta a bit you start seeing all the goodness that was at the bottom start to mix and all the bacon dancing the tango on your plate. I am still not a big fan of Cheesecake Factory because of the usual wait you would encounter especially during weekend dinners.  But going here for lunch on a weekday was pretty painless.  We waited no more than 5 mins before our group of 6 was seated.

Jenn L.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,22,,4.0,6/19/2013,"I've only really had a few of the same things from here but that's because they never fail to disappoint me. Beginning with the wait - depending on when you arrive the wait can range from being seated right away to an hour for a party of two. They don't allow you to call ahead to be placed on the list nor do they allow reservations. Weekend dinner time is usually the most packed.  The complimentary bread - they give each table three rolls (usually two wheat, one sourdough). The wheat bread is by far better than the sourdough, in my opinion but I will still eat the sourdough. They come with butter as well.  Stuffed mushrooms - pretty basic. Six mushrooms stuffed with herbs. They're simple but we order them almost every time. They're fairly reasonable for $3 worth if I remember correctly.  Buffalo wings - we usually get mild. Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan but I don't really like them. My boyfriend loves them so it's not that they're bad it's just like I can't seem to acquire a taste for them. And they're about $9 so pretty pricey for buffalo wings to me.  Side of fries - completely random but there's just something about their fries that have us ordering them with our pastas every time.  Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - the one and only dish I order here. It's honestly not that spicy and I love that they include yellow and red peppers along with asparagus. Their chicken is pretty good but if possible try asking to replace the chicken with the Louisiana chicken (it's kind of like fried chicken) but it's not overwhelmingly huge. The lunch portion is well worth getting if you're not too hungry but I usually opt for the regular.  Jambalaya - my boyfriend always gets it with pasta (you can get the option of rice instead). The chicken is always more tender than the chicken in my pasta so I like to steal his. The shrimp is cooked just as well as the chicken. During the past few visits, though, we've noticed that there isn't enough sauce so we've had to ask for more on the side. They're usually nice about it do don't hesitate if you feel like you need more sauce. This is definitely a must try.  The Cheesecakes - I've only had the Tiramisu and Original and I will definitely pick the original all the time. I felt the tiramisu was too sweet and basically full of cream. It didn't taste like a cheesecake, it just tasted like foamy sweetness. The original did not disappoint. It was perfectly creamy with just the right amount of crust. It's always hard to order a piece of cheesecake considering their pastas are pretty large in portion but the cheesecake is definitely worth trying!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=580

Hanz W.,"Yorba Linda, CA",201,231,81,2.0,8/19/2012,"Cheesecake factory is more for tourists, visiting friends/family, hs dance dinners, business luncheons, or celebration of some sort.  They don't specialize in any particular fare, they have more of a sampling variety of all sorts of cuisines, so more like a little bit of something for everyone.  BJs, Cheesecake factory, Claim Jumpers, OG, Yardhouse, etc etc big chain restaurants. The namesake section is a tiny little section near the front entrance that most people just stare at while waiting to get seated.  For a place called cheesecake factory, I'd probably support more of a cheesecake theme mixed into all their dishes somehow.  Like if they took that cheesecake and turned it into a smoothie drink. Anyhooo, got a Meatloaf dish with mashed potatoes and a corn/squash hash sorta side.  The meatloaf was astoundingly bone dry and I didn't want to ask to send it back because it took a really long time to get so I just asked for several sides of gravy to douse the meatloaf with.  In addition the mashed potatoes while plentiful was provided with like 3 spoonfuls of gravy.  I ran out of gravy in no time and had a whole mound of gravyless mashed potatoes, so again, asked for more gravy.  Might as well give me a pitcher if I need to properly balance the sauce/food myself. The worst thing about being seated in a corner is that other servers won't walk by so if your server disappears for prolonged periods or comes to the area but serves the table behind you and next to you and doesn't even glance at yours and leaves, then you are SOL.  I do prefer high traffic seating just because the likelihood of your server being less than attentive is decent so if someone else can help you, you flag them down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=580

Went there at 4 pm waited 10 minutes for a waiter, he came by, took our drink and food order then we waited 10 minutes for water. I saw our drinks on the service bar sitting there for 10 minutes. Finally went up to the waiter and shift manager and asked for our drinks. The shift manager came up and apologized and said that there were only three staff (boo hop). People that came in 15 minutes after us got their food before us. Guy came up and said that he was the owner and apologized and said that he was going to take care of the check and later brought us a piece of cake (not cheesecake) that we tasted but didn't like. Pissed off super by this time. Asked for the check and paid $42 for three of us. Obviously he didn't pick up the check. Having managed major restaurants before, he was not the owner but a bad general manager.  Don't eat at Cheesecake BREA. BAD, BAD service. Used to be good but they have gone in the toilet.

But, this particular location has disappointed me the last two times I came here.. Came in on a weeknight, not too busy, we get seated immediately only to realize that our table was still dirty. Of course the hostess didn't notice so once we sat down I put my elbows on the table and realized something sticky was on there... I look over and there's a folded used towel and some rice still there... I ask for them to clean it and they cleaned that spot only! Open the menu - menu is dirty...  Waitress was awesome but had way too many tables... They seated her 4 tables one after the other... This brings us to today. Blonde guy as a host, not very friendly and asks us to wait 40 minutes for the patio even though the place is slow... Finally 30 minutes later we get seated and yes, there were only two other parties out there so what was the hold up? Anyway... What really drove me crazy was the other host who simply threw the menus on the table... Of course, no side plates on the table either! Oh and two dirty tables that were not picked up until 10-15 minutes after we were seated...  Waitress was good once again!  Basically, I love Cheesecake Factory as a brand, but this location needs some work on Hostessing and Bussing!  Excellent ultimate margarita though!

There was no organization, lines were all over the place, blocking the waiters' access to the cheesecake kitchen, waiters were bumping into other waiters, people were confused. It was a hot mess.  It was crowded of course, but we stood in the to-go cheesecake line. As we were in line, we heard a waitress say to another waitress, ""Such animals! It's only cheesecake!"" She then yelled at another customer (who was inadvertently in her way), ""DONT stand there!"" We figured it was a grumpy lady having a bad day and continued standing in line browsing a menu.  When the line didn't move for a good 15 minutes, we decided to check out the situation. Turns out we were in the pickup spot and the order line was on the other side. I'd say about 15 waiters passed us while we were in line. Nobody had the sense to tell us we were in the wrong line. When we finally got to order, there was more attitude from the cashier. And then we were told we'd have to wait 30-40 minutes for our cheesecake.

I've always had a pleasant experience with cheesecake factory because the way they compensate their customers when they're lagging is amazing! Last time i was in a rush to get to a movie and i put in a rush order, but it took so long for my pizza to come that i had to request it to go. Turns out that they had burnt my pizza and was in the process of making a new one, so the manager came by and gave me a free slice of cheesecake of my choice for dessert and the waitress to show her apologies gave me and my two friends free sodas to go on the house!  Then second time was when the kitchen was lagging on the food so it took a while before my dish came so the manager came over and compensated me with a free slice of cheesecake!

I waited over 30 minutes and the burger was clearly inedible. Hesitantly, I returned the burger and the waiter told  me it would take another 20 minutes for them to remake the burger. I agreed to the 20 minutes for a new burger and then the manager came to the table. She was the most condescending person I've ever met. She made nothing but obvious, unhelpful comments. Finally I said to just cancel the burger, as I was afraid they would spit in my burger. I waited more than 30 minutes for the check and then not one thing was comped.  I was shocked, so I asked the waiter if he could comp my glass of wine. He rudely told me he would get his manager. She came to the table again and offered me dessert, even thought diet restrictions do not allow me to eat dessert (hence the protein burger). After sitting here for more than an hour and a half I did not eat dinner and finally they comped my glass of wine. I will never come back here.

Tiffany L.,"Walnut, CA",906,346,695,3.0,6/5/2015,"SEAFOOD IS NOT FRESH!!!!!  Today I came in for brunch with my family and we ordered about 4 dishes and 2 of them had shrimp in it. The shrimp sandwich and the cajun jambalaya pasta. Although there wasn't a lot of shrimp in both dishes, but I can certainly tell you it was not fresh at all.  Personally, I'm more sensitive to UN-FRESH seafood, so my body can tell. I will get small bumps and rashes or my throat will feel itchy. You might be thinking ""hey she's probably allergic to shellfish?"" SORRY I AM NOT! I guess you can say I am allergic to cheap and not fresh shellfish? Than yes I guess I will agree with you! Anyways, we got the avocado egg roll, cobb salad, shrimp sandwich, and cajun jambalaya pasta.  The cobb salad was delish as usual!  This was our first time ordering the avo egg roll, it looked really good in the picture, but honestly it is not worth that $11, esp when the egg roll skin is so thick and I think there are better egg roll skin to choose from like the clear rice paper ones.  The shrimp sandwich, had wayy too much mayo or whatever and not enough shrimp and the tomato slices were ginormous!! Not a well made sandwich.  As for the pasta, it tasted good, but I thought it needed a little bit more sauce and i think there was only 3-4 tiny shrimps!!!  Sigh -___- did I just pay $18 for mediocre pasta LOL. So basically our bill was like $75; I think thats wayyy to much esp if there wasnt even any alcohol or dessert in our bill We all know that their cheesecake is obviously delicious!

Daniel S.,"Walnut, CA",68,7,2,4.0,7/26/2015,"There's only one thing you should ever order here. CHICKEN AND SHRIMP GUMBO. That's it! Not steak or pasta. Just CHICKEN AND SHRIMP GUMBO. I'm typically not a fan of American cuisine because I really prefer Asian food but the gumbo at Cheesecake Factory is amazing.  The gumbo has tender chicken, shrimp, and sausage drowned in a thick, creamy sauce that's filled with great spices. A bed of rice sits on top of the gumbo which soaks up all that flavor from the gumbo. Also, DON'T ORDER STEAK HERE!! They just can't seem to get it right. I came here with my family, and my cousin ordered her steak to be medium rare. It came out way past well done. She asked the waiter to have it remade. For the second time it came back WELL DONE. The meat looked as dry as the California drought. The manager then came out to ask her if she wanted to get something else which my cousin did do. One great thing about American restaurants is their customer service. You can't get that kind of service at any Chinese restaurant. The manager let my cousin get a new dish free of charge, and then she took the steak off the bill. She basically got three free meals! .   Lastly, the rye bread they serve here is the best bread I've ever had. You can really get caught up in eating more and more bread as you wait for the food. It's so ADDICTING. It has a subtle sweet flavor  Tip: Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations but if you have a big party you can try coming half an hour to an hour earlier to get them to prepare a setting for your group at the time you want.

My daughter ordered a cheese pizza. The wild mushroom soup is the best mushroom soup I have ever had. Probably one of the only ones I've ever had, but it made me a believer that you're never too old to try something new. It had a real deep, rich, meaty robust flavor. It was excellent.  My daughter's cheese pizza came out extra cheesy and she loved it.  My 4 star is based on the soup and the friendly staff. On another note, I was upset by the fact that you are allowed to bring animals inside a restaurant. Apparently, all you have to say it's a service animal and the staff are trained not to question. There was a lady who was 60+/-,  who was well dressed and appears to be of some wealth, came in with a poodle inside of carrier.  The dog carrier did have a tag showing it was an ""emotional"" service animal.

Our complimentary bread was extremely late... so late, that it arrived a few minutes before our entrees arrived.  Second of all, they got my order wrong and they had to send it back to the kitchen. My husband wanted to wait to eat his food until my food came out so we can enjoy our dinner together, but it would have been cold since I had to wait an extra 15 minutes. Third of all, we ordered low carb cheesecakes to end the night and wait for it.... our waitress said it was FROZEN. So we can wait an hour for it to be ready or take home FROZEN CHEESECAKE.  We came to Cheesecake Factory for the  cheesecake. Needless to say the manager, Joey, was useless when we called to complain about our dinner. Our Saturday date night dinner was ruined. The least they can do was comp a part of our meal for the inconvenience, nope. Nada. Paid full price for awful service. Go to a different location to enjoy your dinner, like Cerritos or Irvine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=200
Danielle T.,"Brea, CA",30,27,,1.0,6/9/2017,"The last two times I have come here, food and service have been sorely lacking. Last night it seemed like our server was spread way to thin and had tables inside and outside. We were seated near a heat lamp and promised it would be warm, but the side of the table that was not next to the heat lamp was freezing. We ordered the salmon rolls and kale salad to start. When they came out the salad did not come out with the modifications I had requested. It took our server over 10 minutes to come check on us and I sent the salad back. The food was delivered about 10 minutes later and the salad had still not come back out. We asked for boxes when the dinner was delivered because it was just too cold. After we had eaten a bit of our food and boxed the rest up, the salad had finally come out and I asked if our server could just box it for us. Our server brought the boxed up food back with the check and said, ""I'm sorry I didn't realize you were in a hurry."" And just walked away rather than asking if anything was wrong. We paid and left and we were charged for the salad. I myself would have told a manager how long the salad had taken and asked them to take it off of the bill. When we got home we realized that there was hardly any dressing on the salad, hardly any sauce on the lemon garlic shrimp, and the steak medallions came with hardly any meat. This Cheesecake Factory use to be on point, but now I cant see myself ever coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=200

Our two favorites:  Chicken Madeira, the potatoes were completely cold and hard a hard ""skin"" on them from sitting out waiting for the chicken I guess.

Our server was nice but in a sarcastic way from the beginning. She also kept forgetting to bring things to us or pretended to not hear me. She even attempted to charge us for extra bread when I ordered 5 items for 3 people. I complained to the manager right before I left, and he kind of just shrugged and was like, ""I guess I can 'give' you extra bread right now... if you want..."" in a very fake, caring tone of voice. I will never go back! At least until they decide to shape up their staff and management. It's sad to think they are opened by the same people as Grand Lux Cafe.

We kept saying excuse me excuse me and nothing finally we asked  for a drink and she said ok not asking the rest of the group for their drink order we asked her. Then after 30 minutes of waiting for a drink she brought us our drinks and check. To add insult to the matter she gave herself an 18% gratuity for a party of four so we were force to tip for service we did not receive. The manager apologized and brought us a slice of cake which was nice but at that point it was a little to late.

Art B.,"Kilauea, HI",0,9,,4.0,12/28/2013,"Four of us just returned from lunch at the Brea Mall Cheesecake Factory Restaurant. Priscilla was our server and was very sweet and friendly but did not listen to what we ordered and three dishes came out different than what we wanted. We sent those three back and the manager came out to see what happened. We told him and he was right on top of the situation. He made sure we had the correct dishes as quickly as possible, checked after they arrived to see if we liked the meals and offered us a free dessert for the mix up and delay.  You know that anyone can make a mistake. It is how the mistake is handled that shows  a truly great restaurant. Not only the manager but several other servers were checking in on our table to ensure we were happy.  We were all impressed with the manager and how he runs the business. We highly recommend this Cheesecake Factory to everyone. The only reason I would not go 5 stars is because of Priscilla. She does not listen well. Even after the botched meal order, I was still eating my lunch and she came up to ask if I was done. I told her ""no"" and she still tried to take my plate away.

Aleyna L.,"Fullerton, CA",103,125,7,4.0,1/24/2012,"I'm a huge fan of The cheesecake factory. I've been going here for more than 3 years and i usually come twice a month.  When i first tried this place, they used to be better for some reason. I always order strawberry lemonade and it just go way too sweet like few months ago and it didn't change till the last visit.  Their portions are mind boggling large at dinner time and just right when you order lunch portion. I recommend spicy chicken chipotle pasta and Fettucini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and garlic noodles. I've also tried Evelyn's favorite pasta and it was meh.. something that you could make at home! They give you white and brown oatmeal bread before the main food. But lately i discovered that they only give you brown bread now! Or was that just me..? i don't think so because i saw so many bread coming in and out only with those brown bread in the basket. Well but i guess that's pretty reasonable because brown bread was the most popular bread and people always asked for that over and over again.  Their service is very good. Never caught a day when they were mean or inattentive!  Just my favorite place to eat for decent price! I can't really say anything about dessert menu because i get stuffed when i finish eating pastas.. But I've tried original cheesecake and obviously the best because it says in their sign board..

Heather B.,"Carson, CA",94,41,7,3.0,3/27/2012,"This place has its potential to be better.. First of all, it is bad mistake to go during the weekend around dinner time because a lot of hugnry people who just finished shopping at Brea Mall don't want to have dinner at the food court. I don't think they take reservation on the weekend and only take walk-ins.. So if you go around 6 or 7 pm on a Saturday, you'll see at least twenty people waiting to be seated. If, after 40+ minutes of waiting, you are seated and have ordered, it'll take another 20 minutes to be served. I feel like the food tastes better during the weekdays... Probably because they don't have to rush.. I ordered what I always order, Farfalle with garlic sauce, and the pasta was undercooked. I didn't even bother asking for another one because I knew I'd have to wait some more. Another thing is that it's really loud... and dark!! It was hard to have converstation :( The cheesecakes are always delicious~ I tried the lemon raspberry for the first time. It's very tangy (almost a little too sour), but if you're not a huge fan of cheesecake.. try the lemon raspberry. It has half cheesecake and half lemon pound cake :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=640

There's always a crowd coming but when we got there with our table of 4, we were seated immediately (around 11:30 on a Sunday). Our waiter was attentive, the bread was warm and the entrees are huge. My appetite has been shrinking a bit so it may be good to try family style next time you're there (unless you really want to bring back appetizers). I ordered the fish burger which actually tasted like a better version of the filet-o-fish. Since they have a huge mound of coleslaw in the burger, I opted for fries with my dish. SO ordered a turkey sandwich, salad (and it came with a soup of the day although I don't think it was mentioned on the menu). It was still filling. My dad ordered the jambalaya pasta and ate it up. He even asked for mild spicy. My mom ordered an omelette breakfast platter with yummy roasted potatoes.

Right?"" lawl, no. I went to the cheesecake factory for a fellow yelpers birthday and I just thought the place was ok.  We came on a Friday night around 6:30 and it was PACKED. Good thing one of my friends made reservations so when I got there we were able to go right to our table. However, when we were waiting near the front for our friend to come get us the hostess didn't even ask us if we need any help and no greeting whatsoever. Rude much? We sat around a large table in the back corner near the patio and we were all bunched up together. Right off the bat I noticed that it was WAY TOO DARK IN THERE! One of my friends kept cracking jokes about how it was way too dark he couldn't even see the menu.  We got our menus and I give them props for having such a large variety.  The price for pasta ranged from around 12 bucks to 25 bucks. The burgers were around 10-15 bucks and I didn't really look at the rest of the menu, but lets just say there's alot to pick from. Maybe TOO much.  Our waiter brought us some fresh bread since my boyfriend and I came a little later so that was a plus. The bread was probably the best part of my meal. Loveeeee their bread and it's also really light. I ended up ordering the Bistro Shrimp Pasta and my boyfriend ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken. The Bistro Shrimp pasta according to the menu had ""Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce."" However, mine had WAY too much tomatoes and not enough spaghettini. Overall, it was pretty good and HUGE I just wish they didn't put so many tomatoes so I could have enjoyed the sauce more. My boyfriend's Carbonara wasn't so great. There wasn't alot of flavor and it tasted very plain to us. He even had to add my leftover tomatoes and sauce to his dish to make it taste better. He said it tasted way better so I guess the extra tomatoes worked out in his favor. Overall the food was just ok and it was way too dark. Good thing my friends were there with me so it made the experience much more enjoyable. Will I be back? Probably since they're giving a $10 gift card for me since I did an online survey. After that?

Jennifer F.,"Los Angeles, CA",437,246,279,2.0,3/7/2011,"Our party of four arrived without reservations and were seated within minutes. We were brought to the patio but our table was still dirty (sticky with crumbs and fries), and our waitress swept everything to the ground. The same thing happened to a larger party. Patrons should only be seated at clean tables!  It was much too dark outdoors. The lights were very weak and the candles weren't helpful. Actually, the waiter forgot to light our candle so we had to ask him to.  Service is friendly but very hasty. It was difficult flagging down a waiter even in such a tiny area. Though, three of them came out to sing us happy birthday which was nice.  The bread was good but very inconsistent. Our first basket consisted of a single loaf of white bread and two loaves of brown grain bread, all of which were room temperature, chunky, and crunchy. Our second basket consisted of three freshly warm and flat (sat on, perhaps?) pieces of brown grain bread.  For entrees, I had the Wild Mushroom Burger with a Kobe patty which I quite enjoyed. I also like the original Kobe Burger. The burgers are gigantic and I was too full to touch my fries.  My friends ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano and Pasta Carbonara, both of which were unimpressive and boring. Different pieces of noodles had different temperatures! The portions were huge and we took about half to go. It would be a nice change for the restaurant to offer half-portions at half-price! $7 VS $14.  For dessert, we had the Red Velvet Cheesecake which was quite good. The whipped cream was fresh and light, but the white chocolate on the outside tasted like plastic!  I like their Godiva Brownie Sundae and Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake as well.

He's no where to be found in plain sight"".  If I would give this location a letter grade, I would skip F, and go straight to letter Z.       We skipped out on the Happiest Place On Earth (gasp, what a bad decision) for my sister's 21st and decided to just grab dinner and cocktails since she just turned legal.  I have an above average tolerance span for waiting for food, but not this time, it took our server 20 minutes to bring out all our food.  At that time, my four cheese pasta that was suppose to be served with sizzling melted cheese blanketing over my pasta, but instead, poor pastas were covered in hardended plastic looking cheese, I didn't know Cheesecake was the FakeCheese Factory.  I was very unhappy.   Buffalo Wings appetizers were good, until I realized I wanted ranch instead of blue cheese, this was when our server was no where to be found.  What a downer when ranch and buffalo wings fail to unite.    When my sister ordered a mojito, our server asked her for her ID, and I, with no shame, blurted ""it's her 21st birthday!"" and a smart, considerate, supurb server would automatically have a lightbulb shining on top of their head with ""this calls for a birthday dessert"" marquee scrolling round and round.  But no, he didn't get it.  I was too irritated to ask for it, and my sister was too nice and she said ""it's ok, I don't want it.""  Seriously, who doesn't want to feel special on their birthday, I mean, come on. Oh, on the free bread, did you know we had to ask for them?  He didn't bring them out, we had to ask.  That's a big nono, Cheesecake.  Honestly, if I can give them a 0 star, I seriously would, but I guess folks at Yelp are just nice people that doesn't want to put what is suppose to be excellent chain restaurants to shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=640
S L.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,173,,4.0,2/21/2011,"This restaurant is in the Brea Mall shopping plaza near the end of the parking lot  Has it's own valet parking service. Just to clarify, cheesecake factory serves food other than cheesecake. Whenever I go, there's an inherent desire to purchase cheesecake. But the driving force that gets me there is often the entree. Environment: Similar to the more frequented restaurant in Sam Diego's Fashion Valley Mall, it's always loud. Cheesecake factory is one of the few restaurants that does not take reservations yet still manages to fill up for dinner and most times for lunch. Amazing! If they started allowing for public purchases of franchises, I would definitely invest. The tables are distributed well and at night, the restaurant is dimly lit. For lunch, lots of natural light penetrate the many floor to ceiling windows. Not too bright with just the right amount of light. Upon arriving, you head to the front desk to get seated or pick one a beeper. Gets crowded and some people don't understand how to form lines. Otherwise, no problems. Waiter/waitresses: all very friendly. Most of time, they're a bit younger. They come by frequently to check on you throughout the meal. Occasionally, they take breaks during your meal but their temporary replacements are more than adequate in providing service. The service here isn't quite as good as that it's San Diego counterpart. Things just seem to move a little slower. Food: the best part of this culinary experience. There are several pages of appetizers and entrees to choose from. Have tried a good number appetizers including firecracker salmon rolls, thai lettuce wraps, spinach artichoke dip, and the cheese and crab dip. The favorite is probably firecracker salmon rolls which are served with a spicy thai flavor sauce on a bed of shredded radishes. The entree I always order is the thai chicken pasta. Only once has it been merely satisfactory. Otherwise, always tasty. Green noodles, large chunks of chicken, peanuts, some sort of bean, and bell peppers covered with a slightly spicy peanut sauce. So darn good! Desserts are alway a slice of cheesecake. The favorite is the kahlua coffee cheesecake. Hard to explain why. Maybe it's the perfect combination of coffee and cheese flavor that makes it so irresistible. Drinks: mostly stick with water. On occasion, will order the strawberry lemonade which is a bit sweet (might be from concentrate). No strawberry chunks within the drink. I think we've ordered a blended drink before. Not sure what it wa but there were no complaints afterward. Recommendation: EAT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=640

Carrie D.,"Littleton, CO",156,336,10,3.0,9/1/2011,"I'm rating this based on a pickup experience, so maybe if I ever eat in at this location, I can update my review. This week, I wanted a good, healthy meal and since I'm traveling alone, I wanted to be able to pick it up and take it back to my hotel. After browsing the menu online, I saw that the Cheesecake Factory has a 'Skinnylicious' section of their menu for weight-conscious meals. PERFECTO! So, after figuring out what I wanted, I called to place the order so I could pick it up after work. The guy who took my order was somewhat helpful, but told me that neither of the things I wanted were available for take out, which was disappointing. So I had to figure out something else. Eventually I placed my order for the weight management spicy chicken salad and the crispy crab bites, which were both within my calorie budget! Right on time, I pulled in to CF, and parked in their curbside pickup area to wait. After close to 15 minutes, I actually had to call them to see why they hadn't brought my food out yet. They took the description of my car and everything and anytime I've ever done this with other places they come right out pretty quick. When I got my food it seemed like it had been sitting in the containers for a while. The crab bites were soggy. The salad was good, but the chicken was a bit dry. Just not the quality I'd expect. Anyway, I realize this probably isn't indicative of their service, which is why I gave 3 stars. But I was disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=680

With that out of the way...  The food just delicious. With such a diverse menu, you might think they cooks wouldn't be able to get it all right. I've been CF numerous times and with copious amounts of people. No complaints. For an appetizer, I will usually go for the Avocado Egg-rolls. For the entree, I typically order off their breakfast menu (served all day!). It's all good, but I just recently had the Morning Quesadilla. It's one of the ""healthiest"" options on the menu at just under 600 calories and it's pretty filling.  Good food, great service, love it.

She was understanding and I was happy she made the effort to accommodate us. She said we would have to wait BUT would try to make it as quick as possible.  on the Sunday we arrived, it was packed. We only had to wait 15 min. Our waitress took our order quickly and keep things moving which was very much appreciated.

Jenn S.,"Santa Fe, NM",9,72,3,2.0,2/14/2011,"I debated writing this because honestly I love cheesecake factory's food. I don't enjoy admitting my love of a chain restaurant's cuisine, since it's one step away from calling a Big Mac a work of art. I would consider eating the incredible eggplant sandwich at CF over spending time with my family. It makes my days brighter, the homeless look a little cleaner, and the fact that taxes make up most of my pay check since I moved here not so bad. I have ordered it on dates and tuned them out while I ate this amazingly messy monstrosity and ended up wearing it.  But.. the service has seriously sucked at this location. I've gone in twice (alone!) and sat at the bar and been ignored, when people who come in groups and sit at the bar received attentive service. Just annoying and rude.

I have had their factory nachos as an entree even though it is an appetizer, and I'd have to say that that could feed a whole family as an entree. I barely made a dent into it and I was full.  Cheesecake factory is really successful, and I can see why. You get a lot of food, and you don't have to end up spending an arm and a leg. Service here is alright, I heard two female bartenders talking about how they'd rather go home and complain about how they were open past 11 o'clock. This really bothers me because they should really staff people who want to work rather than people who would complain on the job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=280

Haven't been here in a couple years up until last night. We were seated outside as it was the first available seating. There was one heat lamp near us and we asked our severe and FOUR times if they could turn it on because it was so cold. They never turned it on, we ended up turning it on ourselves, which we would have done to begin with but the person who seated us said he would have to get someone to turn it on.  Also, we waited and waited for our bread, but it never came. We asked them and they were like ""oh you never got it?"" So, dinner comes out and we still don't have bread, kind of defeated the purpose l, but we reminded them again and we finally got our bread...after dinner!  I ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp with town rice instead of the white rice it usually comes with. It was surprisingly delicious!! I will get it to go next time because I would rather not deal with their service, luckily I had a good time with friends and we were too busy catching up to get hung up on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=280

I like the flavor combinations on that plate.  Ok first of all we were seated way at the back near the kitchen. Which meant every few seconds we hear the loud band of servers slamming the dishes into the sink. There was a disgusting odor of either dirty mop or nasty dish rag. This was the ongoing argument between me and my boyfriend on and off through the dinner. He thought it was dish rag while I insisted it was dirty mop..anyway.... The server came and took our drink orders rather quickly but after bringing our drinks she dissapeared for a long time. After our order was taken we waited about 15 minutes for them to bring us bread which was rock hard and cold.  We got our  appetizer the ""firecracker salmon"" this is the biggest rip off ever. We got a plate of four greasy pieces of deep friend wonton like pockets. The taste was bland and way over priced for the amount you get. Do not order that appetizer. Plus it took forever for this to come out. Over 20 minutes.  I have been here before and this experience was not good at all. We asked for more bread and a server ran by and slammed our bread on the table and ran off. We had to flag someone else down for more butter. Either way the service and the fact that it smelled so gross in there ruined this dining experience. Its way to expensive to have such a bad experience.

Y T.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,17,,2.0,3/16/2016,"most of the time when I dine at a cheesecake factory the food is fairly descent but I just dined at the brea location and the breakfast potatoes (cubed) with onions was horrible! they were over cooked, burned, and none of us could hardly find any onions. the scrambled eggs were also over done and dry. the english muffins were under toasted as they were almost as white as they come in a package. service was also slow as it took some time to get some of our water refills after asking several times during our time there. the coffee refills came steadily though. we were there for a birthday and we were told we would receive a complimentary dessert but it was never offered to us even though we brought a small cake of our own. It's not a huge deal about the complimentary dessert but you would figure you would be asked anyhow. hopefully the corp. chef of the cheesecake factory will look into this overcooked foods as we were a little taken back by the fact that the runners and even management didn't question the cooks back there that the potatoes were obviously burned, etc...

I liked the grilled chicken and the curry noodles along with the sauces they provide. The lettuce that they provide usually fresh.  Cheesecakes Recommendations *Snickers Bar Cheesecake *Kahlua Cheesecake  *Tiramisu Cheesecake!  Service is usually good. The servers are pretty attentive. Sometimes they'll box our items.

The menu is huge and I know I have tried a few different things that I have enjoyed. I never really choose to come here on my own, as I would rather try new places than continue to frequent this chain. On Saturday we were in Brea and wanted breakfast. I remembered having a good breakfast here a couple years ago so I suggested we come here. Well, they do have breakfast, but a limited menu. It looks like Sunday is the day to go, because that menu was much bigger and had better options. BF ordered the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich which was eggs, bacon, ham, tomato, cheese and mayo on a Brioche Roll. It was pretty good, I should have ordered that. I got the Sunrise Fiesta Burrito (the waiter said was a very good choice) which is a massive burrito filled with eggs, chicken chorizo, potatoes, peppers and onions. It is topped with salsa, an avocado and tomatillo cream sauce, and cilantro. When they brought the burrito they also gave me a separate plate with black beans on it. For this burrito having so many ingredients that sound awesome, the flavor just wasn't there for me. I ate about half of it and I only saw a couple pieces of chorizo (which wasn't spicy at all) and there were way more potatoes than eggs. The black beans on the side were kind of weird to me, so I tossed some on the plate and mixed it up with the burrito. I don't know, it just didn't do it for me.  Breakfast, with an iced tea and a Mocha Milkshake, was $40. Ehhh, this seemed more like a $20 breakfast to me, but again, this place is overpriced. I'm sure I won't be back again until my boyfriend's family wants to go here to celebrate a birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=280

Our waiter looked like he was around our age and had an attitude problem. It took almost an HOUR for us to get our food (I don't think it takes an hour to prep and make a couple orders of salads, pastas, burgers and fries, thanks). A table that came after us got served before us and by the time they were paying the bill, we were still waiting for our orders to be brought to our table & served. -__-   When I FINALLY took a bite into my burger, I realized it was cold and nearly spit it out. The fries were soggy. I would have been better off going to McDonald's and getting a Big Mac and fries, and would have been more satisfied.  When I tried food from other peoples' plates, I found the food to be disappointingly bland and just ""meh"". They should stop charging top dollar for subpar quality food, or maybe put the money they make from their overpriced food towards better training their servers to be more competent and less douchey.

The food was four stars. (Too many choices!)  It's noisy inside, so it's not a place to go to chat, because you will have to scream, then duck your ear near their mouth to hear. But the waiter, was just stretched too thin. We waited 20 minutes to order. He didn't refill coffee, and we had to ask for creamer. He didn't bring ketchup for fries, or other condiments for other food. He could have saved himself from running around to fetch those things, if he had just brought them in the first place. I noticed that the table next to us was also asking for things like more salad dressing and soy sauce. We waited forever for him to bring the containers for leftovers and the check. He was friendly and polite, but was not a seasoned waiter who minimizes the number of trips to a table. Maybe if the they had a person for just refills? Maybe if they had ""waiter school"" for newbies? Maybe if they put sound absorbing materials on the walls and section dividers? Maybe if they routed diners waiting for tables in one area, and diners trying to leave go out through another area?

Brought it to the attention of the manager and she explained that she does have the staff wipe it down org Lysol wipes and such which I think is a complete lie because it wouldn't look that way once we are seated.

Our group consisted of 8 people - relatively a manageable size I presume.  Service: Our server was definitely on something - we are still figuring that out. He completely creeped us out, but aside from that... really ""how many times do we need to ask for lemons?"" We asked for lemons for our water when we placed our drink order (ordered cocktail + water w/ lemon). To make a loooooong story short we asked him whenever he walked by (not that many times) & finally politely asked 2 other servers - very sweet lady who was always smiling brought them half way thru our meal. We should've initially asked her.  It took ""messed up hair spike here & there guy"" close to an hr to take our order & this is bc we kept asking & he would in return say, ""I'll be back give me a couple of minutes."" What really got him to FINALLY take our order was... My friends flowers were sitting there in the heat so one of the girls put them in the water cup. He saw this and freaked out... He lectured her & touched the bouquet saying it could spill nevertheless it fell right after he touched it. He went off on her (leaving us speechless in shock), he wiped spilled water off with my sisters dinner napkin & LEFT IT THERE ALL NIGHT. Then proceeded to say, ""Ugh... I'll just take your order now."" FINALLY!!!  Never did this guy check on us, he completely looked out of it & easily snapped. A whole cheese cake was purchased & he brought us HOT plates. When asked for a box for the cake - he came & left it on a chair. I mean he really went out of his way to make us not want to tip him - too bad gratuity was included.

Wendy W.,"Rowland Heights, CA",206,12,9,1.0,5/7/2011,"Please bare with me, but today is my first YELP!  It's sad that it had to be a negative one. Don't get me wrong b/cuz of my star rating. Me, my husband, family and friends go to Cheesecake Factory all the time. I love their cheesecake variety and or we go there to just chill and hang out for drinks or dinner. BUT, where do I start but to say, OMG! There was a small thin piece of metal in my husband's ""California Cheese Steak!""  He took his second bit and to his luck he chewed right onto it. I have to admit that doesn't sound like the most pleasant thing to happen but I'm glad he didn't end up swallowing it. He made this funky noise while chewing and the next thing I know, he's trying to spit it out immediately. We both looked at it and was was trying to figure out what it could possibly be.  It was shiny, slightly edgy, thin piece of metal. Now, of course we are NOT going to continue to eat this sandwich because who knows what else could be in there or even where that piece came from. So, we told the waitress to take it back. She was a actually a sweet thing and apologized and seemed fairly concerned and apologetic to the situation. The kitchen manager also later came over and acknowledged that he was addressed of the situation and apologized that this had happened to us. And that we would not be charged for that sandwich. (Cause there is no way I would be paying for a sandwich that was barely touched, not alone finding a piece of metal in it) Which later asked that we can fill out a form of the situation.  Which is all good because he was doing his job and I can understand it's all protocol. But, as a customer's perspective I don't feel they really cared about finding out how it got there or at least making us feel reassured that they would investigate on it so that it would not happen again. Which is a bit irritating cause I would be worried about why is there bits of metal in food. Or at least reassuring the customer at least. Instead their only response to us was, ""I'm sorry to hear that this happen to you. We are shocked. Fill this out form so there is a record of it.  But, I don't know where this could of come from. Because, it couldn't of come from our kitchen.""  Paused with a few secs of silence and looking at us like we could of possibly known where it came from.   Now, this is where I am HEATED about the whole thing. Throughout the remainder of our meal, Me & my husband noticed that many of the host or either floor managers basically watching us eat. I literally felt uncomfortable to even finish my meal. I felt as if we were being observed because they were starring at us in groups of 2 or 3.  As if we planted the dang metal piece. Or as if the answer would magically appear by watching over us. Now, seriously... we just wanted to be acknowledged and concerned for by telling them what happened to our sandwich. Instead of having a fun Friday night watching the game, getting dinner, drinks & dessert. I felt as if they just wanted us to leave so the situation would go away with us.  I think we were quite good customers.Overall we didn't complain, get mad, or give the kitchen manager or the waitress a hard time about the metal piece. Other than just tell them to please take it back. However, it seemed like we were suspects. Seriously!!??? Over a sandwich we barely touched or ate?  Now the whip cream to the 'cheesecake' (excuse the pun). As, we were leaving I went over to the hosted table to ask for a business card. Now this isn't shocking. But, it happens to be that all people watching us eat were all gathered together in hosted area. As if they were waiting for us to leave.  What a coincidence, that the kitchen manager and I am assuming the floor managers happen to merge all together as we were exiting. When I asked for a card, 1 gentlemen replied. Sure, let me get you one. While another gentlemen sharply snapped at me, ""IS THERE A PROBLEM?!!!"" Now, if you can hear the tone. It was intense and rude! As if I was an obnoxious customer causing a scene or causing trouble from the beginning. Come on. I was just asking for a business card. Based on that remark alone and the attitude through the remainder of my meal. It was HORRIBLE!  I don't wish it upon any other customer. Seriously, that experience shocked me! This is why I am 'Yelping'... for the very first time! Crazy as it may sound, though their food and environment is nice to hang out. Seriously! NOT WORTH the customer service provided by the management tonight!  I rather paid double somewhere else to get dinner or drinks than to feel like this.  WARNING TO ALL THOSE THAT GO TO THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION!!!!! If you have a problem with your meal. BE CAREFUL, they probably thinking your scamming out of it. EVEN when u barely touched it!

The green beans, meat, fish, mashed potatoes, even the corn. Perfect seasoning, perfect proportions, the chef did a bang up job kudos. The server was also very attentive and helpful.

Vodka tonic was very weak and the Pinnaple Mojito was delicious but the mint could have been mettled more and the contain more ALCOHOL.  Once we got to the table, bread and water came out fast and the food did as well.

Cons: The price of drinks and the dim lighting outside. Notes: The wait was a con as well but it was a Saturday night at 7-8pm. I didn't expect it to be slow at all. The pro though was we wasted 45min walking around the mall across the way. I had fresh grilled salmon with large, juicy asparagus and a large mound of mashed red potatoes. The salmon was cooked well and wasn't crunchy, the asparagus wasn't over cooked and was perfect with the potatoes. They had some Georgia Peach drink that was addicting and tasty, couldn't get enough of the peach flavor. The server was very kind funny and made the night enjoyable and the experience that much better. It almost felt like I was on a date with how smooth things were going.

Liz K.,"San Francisco, CA",8,108,40,4.0,3/7/2011,"MMmmmm.  Oh how I hate that I love the taste of fat.  Okay, so I know it's so very big-box and if you eat here regularly, you'll need a stint placed in your neck to siphon out and clear your blocked carotid arteries, but, that being said, I can't help but return to CF when I'm visiting my mom down in SoCal / Brea area and I don't have any plans for dinner.  It's my default for grindage when I have a hankering for some downright heavy, mood-altering food.  I only go after a thousand-calorie-burning workout and I use their published calorie info.  You can still come out with a deficit in calorie expenditure for the day if you are careful.  Their health management salads are tasty.  Hibachi steak is fabulous.  Blasted farmhouse burger is downright dangerous.  Eat half and save the other for next day.  Alternatively, take up marathon running training and eat the whole damn burger in one sitting ....but see your doc about Lipitor.  They used to have a short ribs dish that we'd order for my mom but it's no longer on the CF menu.  The waiter said it was too expensive for the amount of meat you got (it was a $30 dish and I didn't think that was too expensive-- too bad they discontinued offering it - my mom loved that dish).  Personally, the miso salmon is one of my favorites, but at 1673 cals, make sure you can afford that intake. Then, fuhgeddaboudit and enjoy! :) Aside from the food, service by servers her has been fabulous every time we've been over the years.  Just recently, we went on a bustling Friday evening with the restaurant bursting with peeps.  Overflow of hungry people waiting outside with beepers in hand.  Even when so busy, we were served with patience and conscientiousness -- which is always much appreciated and noticed by way of tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=800

My mother also ordered a well-done burger with onion strings in it. The first time, the cooks forgot the onion strings; the second time, the cooks made it a medium grill. My mom didn't want to eat anymore because she lost her appetite. My pepperoni pizza wasn't as good as usual because it was burnt, and a couple of the slices were soggy. I could barely finish half.

I got the BBQ Salmon served with corn succotash, mash potatoes, and crisp onion rings. A steal @ 16.95. All the items work well together and I just love BBQ sauce on my salmon. My wife had Chipotle Chicken Pasta. Quite tasty, but a little too savory. To finish the meal we tried the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake.

Setting- very nice and spacious. Lights were very dim my bf kept asking if the lights were going to get ""turned on"". I am not sure if its always that dim or maybe its just a romantic vday thing. You can sit inside or the cute little patio with lights twinkling. Service/server- Took about 8-10 minutes for us to meet our waiter. He was very busy so It was okay. He took very long to assist us or to check up on us but we were okay at first because he brought us bread. Second time around he took about 10 minutes after we decided on what we were getting to take our order. Came back once for refills. Came with my parmesan halfway after I was done eating my pasta. He literally gave me and my boyfriend like 10 minutes to enjoy our food then asked if we were ready to box them up...  inside my head I was thinking ""Uhh..actually we're just resting so we can eat some more!"" but I wanted to be a lady on a nice little date and not eat all the food haha.  Food- I was in the mood for shrimp and got the shrimp with angel hair and the shrimp was just big and juicy looking. My bf got the Bistro Shrimp pasta which I thought was amaaazing. I kept picking on my bf's food. I really wanted to switch plates but I felt bad for my bf. My food was okay. I was expecting a creamy white sauce pasta but instead got a red tomato pasta. The Bistro has crispy shrimp and it was creamy. I am def. coming back to get the Bistro pasta. We told ourselves we'd get dessert but we were too stuffed.  Although I didnt get it this time, the Red Velvet Cheesecake is to die for. Its my favorite cheesecake so far and Im not even a big fan of cheesecake. It red velvet with cheesecake and white chocolate shavings.. yummmm! Can probably do three bites then its too much goodness to eat in one setting. I love it though.

I walked up to check my name on the list and complain and the girl couldn't care less. Her attitude was pretty much ""shut up and keep waiting"" I kept on waiting and I saw this group of five (that I saw come in as I was waiting) get their table pretty much right away: that really pissed me off.

Katherine H.,"Pomona, CA",22,12,2,4.0,4/20/2011,"I'm a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, though I do feel weary of corporate chain restaurants,this is an exception. Notorious for their huge portions that swiftly and sneakily overwhelm your daily calorie intake, you can easily avoid bulging waistlines by sharing a generous plate of almost any entrée on their menu. Their bread is also a favorite of mine, I love the multi grain one, and I try to to steer clear of the sourdough but its just too  good. Entrée-wise I preferably am very keen on their Chicken Madeira which I'm sure everyone and their mother has tried. Also the Lemon and Herb Chicken was pretty good since I'm a huge fan of anything lemon-y. A slightly newer dish that I've tried was the Chicken Bellagio which was topped with generous amounts of angel hair pasta with garlic pesto topped with two generous pieces of crisp breaded chicken and garnished with two or three slices of prosciutto, really delicious, but be careful, sometimes this dish varies on its sodium count, so this dish can be a hit or miss and will come out too salty sometimes.               A really good appetizer, which I mostly consider an entrée in itself are the Thai lettuce wraps, for $10.95 it comes with carrots, bean sprouts, a choice of three different peanut-based Thai sauces and grilled chicken strips that leave you completely satisfied, I assure you. I also commend this place for having great drinks, especially their caffe lattes which are similar in price to Starbucks but seem to tone down the sweetness of the syrups without sacrificing the taste of coffee. Also their smoothies, especially the Strawberry one is so good, every sip is completely gratifying. On desserts, I've tried the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, which is pretty decadent but I like my chocolate dark and a bit on the bitter side, but thats me. Favorite cheesecakes: Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake, White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, and Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake (say that 5 times fast!). Overall, been going to this place ever since I was 12 and though nowadays I am a bit more health and also budget conscious, I always come back here when I expect instant gratification.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=820

Ashley W.,"Walnut, CA",85,143,97,3.0,10/19/2008,"So far I've been to the Cheesecake factory at Newport Beach, Redondo Beach, Santa Anita, and last night I was at Brea.  They sat us outside and I gotta admit it was pretty warm due to the heater next to us. However, the bad thing about sitting outside is: 1) Smokers 2) Forgotten by waiters and/ or waiters do not return for a long time  3) Bread comes first before the untensils and plates This Cheesecake factory is VERY SMALL so expect at least 30 mins wait to be seated on busy days, and that's for TWO people only. The bigger the group= the longer the wait. ( at least 45-50 mins they say). I had the Chicken tomato basil pasta, and it was alright. There were small slices of chicken breast on top of tomato pasta mixed with cubes of tomatoes and mozerella cheese. I thought it was a little bland, so you're better off ordering something else.  I always eat the strawberry shortcake in the end, and I was surprised with what they gave me. It was HUGE and LOADED with strawberries, unlike the one at Newport Beach were there were barely any. However, the cake itself was barely noticeable in sight and taste, so it was kind of disappointing.  I think I'm better off sticking to other Cheesecake factories simply because it's not as cramped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=820

It's heated so it was still warm. They start you off with some white bread and a honey oat dark bread with butter.  The honey oat is the better of the two. For an appetizer we got the buffalo blasts.  There's about 7 strips and its more like finely chopped chicken marinated in buffalo sauce breaded, then deep fried. I love these and they served it with ranch and buffalo sauce with celery sticks on the side. For the meal I got one of the specials which was the salisbury chopped steak.  The steak part had a mushroom sauce on top with carmerlized onions and it was pretty good.  They give you two big scoops of mashed potatoes that are really good.  The green beans were good except they were slightly over seasoned and they didn't chop off the ends.

My boyfriend's office had their lunch party here a couple hours after mine started, so the timing worked out. I only tasted some of the food and had a ""mug"" of water. Parking is a pain in the freakin' rear here! I've been told that even when we're not in the holiday season, the parking is kind of a pain. One lady I talked to in the restroom said that she attempted to get valet, and despite two open spaces, they refuse to let her valet. How bizarre. She said that now that she has had two lemon drops, she's ready to go back and slap them silly. The wait for food took fooooooorever. Granted, they were pretty busy but geez, it was already 2:30 in the afternoon. I didn't care as I already had lunch, but everyone seemed to care. The service was very friendly, but hunger pangs cut into that. The food is really no different from the Spectrum's CF, which I've already reviewed. The steak here was nicely cooked to order (the medium rare actually came out tender and medium rare) and the food portions are huge, although I rather get good food in normal portions then average food in giant portions. My boyfriend also got the apple crisp which was more mush, less crisp. The highlight was the ice-cream. That's sad.  I didn't like the way they set up our big table because if you were sitting on the bench area, you had to move 4 people out of your way to use the restroom. With the amount of liquids being consumed during the long wait for food, a lot of people had to go repeatedly to the restroom.  So, for the average food, looooooooong wait for food and the horrid parking, it's only 2 stars. Nice servers though, and at least the steak is cooked to order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=820
Isomer I.,"San Diego, CA",5,31,38,5.0,12/26/2007,"We have held a Christmas Dinner here for the past two years for a party of 25 - 30 people on a Saturday night right before Christmas. Of all the places where we have ever gathered, this Cheesecake Factory in Brea has, by far, handled it with more aplomb than all the other restaurants put together. Not only does it have the space, but we have always been seated on time or ahead of schedule. They warn us to arrive 1 hour and 30 minutes early to get a place holder in the queue for a group this large, but the few of us that arrive early, hang out in the bar and when it comes time for our group to be seated, it has never been late. On top of that, they assign us at least two waiters who are attentive to every member in the group. There is no need to flag down someone for a refill and with a group as large as ours that means they are staying on top of over 30 drinks! Our food arrives hot and delicious and the bill is never hard to decipher. In fact, they have no problem with splitting the bill into reasonable chunks. The seating is more than spacious and easily accommodates groups larger than ours without having to split us up among different tables. Having had our Christmas Dinner at places where a restaurant claimed to be able to accommodate us, but to arrive and have our group crammed into corners with no elbow room, the spaciousness here is a welcome change. We pick places central to all of us, so we don't always have previous experience of having eaten at them. I have seen the lines for others waiting to be seated here and I can certainly sympathize. But this restaurant wouldn't be so popular if the food wasn't good and if you're going to arrive on a busy night, deal with it. I have rarely eaten at a popular restaurant on a busy night and have NOT had to wait at least an hour to be seated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=820

Five minutes or so later she came back with a cup of warm water and said she'll try to find some honey or lemon.  Another 10 mins+ or so passes and she came back with some lemon.  More time passes, by now the water is getting pretty close to room temp and she came back with some honey.  She really have no excuse for taking that long since there were barely that many people in there.    Our waitress came back, took our order and said she'll bring out some bread for us in a bit because she's waiting for the fresh hot batch. Customers start to slowly come in and were seated to both sides of us (we were sitting in the row of booths that were facing the bar).  Their server came with their drinks AND the bread basket before us!!!  We sat and waited for a while and she finally came back with a bread basket.  At this point, we thought maybe she went off and took a break without telling us about it.  Was it hot and fresh out of the oven like she claimed it would be?! ABOSLUTELY NOT!!!  it was COLD!!  At this point we were getting pretty irritated.  We had to ask a different waiter to get us a basket of bread that are actually hot or at least warm.  This waiter was kind of enough to do so for us and did so pretty quickly.   All the waiting and what not pretty much ruined the meal for us.  Did we wanted to leave a tip? Heck no!! but did we? Yes we did give her the 15%...  did she deserved it?! ABSOLUTELY NOT.  We were seriously thinking of getting of name down and file a complaint.  I guess it's her lucky day.  Would I want to come back to this location and get the horrible service? ...

I was quoted a wait time of 45 minutes. My party and I patiently waited. When the time reached closer for us to get our table we were told that it was going to be about 10 minutes more; however, the manager made a mistake. He quickly came over and apologized for telling us that it was sooner than he thought. He came to us twice to give us an update on our table. He could have not told us anything and make us wait longer. He personally walked us to our table and gave us some free appetizers for waiting. There was a table next to us that opened up as soon as we sat down and the manager insisted that we spread out more and brought the table closer to us. It was great. The chef came out and brought out our appetizers and even checked on us during our meal to make sure everything was tasty. The manager also checked up on us during our meal. I will definitely visit this location again and no longer be hesitant about planning dinners for large parties at the Brea location. My party of 11 as well as myself was truly taken aback by the customer service at this Brea location. This is something that is a rarity especially with large parties and during the holiday season.

On my last visit, Kassidy R. accompanied me for what was explicitly to be a Cheesecake Tasting Adventure.  See, I don't just focus all my energy on pancakes.  My personal goal is to pretty much try every type of cheesecake listed in the menu, but not all on the same day.  Takeru Kobayashi, I ain't.

Leilani B.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,7/7/2013,"Bottom Line: Other Cheesecake Factories are better than this one. I came here last night with some friends; hoping to experience the same A-plus service I have received from the many other CFs I've been to before. We were seated after maybe 15 minutes of waiting, which was a big plus for us since it was a Saturday night! One star for that! This CF is one of the most beautiful I have ever been to! They have gorgeous high ceilings, and cheesy yet cute paintings and props. Though the Egyptian theme is a little hokey, people like me love when restaurants make you feel like you're in another world -- one star for that! Once we got to our booth though, we were surprised at how rock hard the cushions were! Seriously? This CF seems pretty new, how on earth could their booths be that worn out?! It seriously felt like we were just sitting on a wooden bench all night. One star off for that, you want your guests comfortable -- right? Now, our server. She was, um, friendly I guess. I don't even know what her name was because I don't think she told us. She didn't offer to answer any questions about the menu, which totally sucked because we all were a little overwhelmed with the options. Sadly though, due to the fact that she disappeared for like 20 minutes, when she did come back to take our order, we just wanted to put our order in before we ended up spending all whole evening there. When we finally got our food she didn't check up on us until we were done; which sucked because my friend needed some ranch for her fries, but eventually gave up on her request after spending 10 minutes looking for our waitress. What also bothered me was the fact that when it came to dessert time, the waitress just dropped one menu at the table and then walked away. Hello? There were five of us seated; wouldn't it be considerate to at least bring enough menus to go around the table? Oh, well, maybe this CF just doesn't train their employees to be like most other restaurants in this chain. One star off for that, I would at least want good service, because that's what this chain claims to be all about. And now the food, I ordered the chicken medeira. It was delicious as usual, until I got to the asparagus. I took one bite of it expecting the usual savory flavor, but no, not this time. After one bite of the asparagus I nearly gagged, it tasted so sour! I have never had asparagus taste that way before, so since I was concerned about how old it was, I just skipped on it all together and left it to the side of the plate. One star off for that, all restaurants should ensure that the food they cook is fresh. All-in-all, this place is a lame Cheesecake Factory. I would not recommend going to this location. If you like bad service and spoiled food though, this place was made for you! Good luck, Yelpers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=660

Jason A.,"Cerritos, CA",1079,700,1631,3.0,12/30/2008,"This Cheesecake Factory was the closest one to Cerritos before the one at the Anaheim Gardenwalk opened up.  This stand-alone unit is pretty good in terms of attractiveness, but being a stand-alone unit is also its downfall. It's not directly connected to any shopping center, so if you decide to change your mind or find out that the wait is two days, you'll probably have to get back in your car and continue your search for food in a vehicle.  It also doesn't offer any diversions while you wait for your pager to go off. The Brea Mall parking lot is the worse shopping center parking in Orange County and one of the largest. It would take half a day to cross the damn thing. Not to mention, you'll be well out of the range of the pager's signal radius. The food here is comparable with most other Cheesecake Factory's: Large portions and good quality food. I've only been here once and it was as a welcome-back dinner for my dad after traveling abroad. The service was great that night, but then again, it may have to do with the fact that the terms my family used was server jargon (I have brothers who work as servers). I would recommend coming by here if you're in the Brea Mall vicinity and you're looking to eat at a nice sit-down restaurant. Oh, and to get the most out of your money, always ask for a to-go cup of whatever it is you're drinking.

The hostess (I think her name was Katie) who picked up was very friendly and told me that there was no need for a reservation, that I would be able to be seated when I got in. True to her words, she had saved a table for us even though there were other people. We were seated immediately and our waitress, Michelle, was very accomodating to my group. I hadn't realized that my friends had invited more people than I had expected, but Michelle didn't hesitate and had more chairs to be fetched for us (although the restaurant was pretty much packed). She then personally went to each person describing what kind of food we might like and what not. She was very attentive, along with Christopher, whom replaced Michelle when she went off. The food was alright, I ordered the Original Hamburger, and it was like any other burger, but much larger with extra cheese. But no less, it was still pretty delicious. The order also came with fries, that were too fried for me personally, but they came with it so mind as well eat it. If I may suggest, it's much better to get their steak- it's unbelievably delicious, but the price is a bit much, I'd admit. It's tender and super juicy and if it's not made to your liking, they'll have no problem in making sure it's made right. At the end, our bill came out to about $210 dollars for my group.

Grace S.,"La Mirada, CA",168,55,322,3.0,9/26/2009,"Despite its name the cheesecake factory serves more than just cheesecake. In fact it serves a variety of dishes from burgers to pastas to Asian inspired cuisine. For dessert, aside from the dozens of different types of cheesecakes that seem to be available you can also have things like warm apple crisps topped with vanilla ice cream, tiramisu, sundays, and a variety of cakes.  My husband and I had a couple of gift certificates to use so we decided the Cheesecake Factory was a perfect place to eat (and it would be free). Normally, I wouldn't eat at the Cheesecake Factory. The average price of all the dishes is a little high for me for what you get. The food is good, but not great. Unless you have a reservation, I've never had to wait less than 20 minutes for a table. It's only worth the wait if you don't have to do it often.  The cheesecake lives up to the name. Now, it really is outstanding cheesecake. There is a cheesecake for every taste, whether you like chocolate or fruit, plain or low carb. Pumpkin cheesecake? Carrot cake cheesecake? Lemon raspberry cream cheesecake? They've got one for you. A slice of cheesecake from the factory is nearly a meal in and of itself. It's rich and creamy and makes me savor each and every single bite.  The service is outstanding. Every single time I go there every server is friendly, cheerful, quick, helpful... I'm just a little stunned how good the service is for such a busy place. Great, I've hyped it up for you. Let's just say they are well above average when it comes to service. The food comes out fast and hot and my drink glass never seemed to get more than half empty. Sometimes I would turn away for what seemed like a few seconds and suddenly, the glass was full again.  To tell you the truth, I don't actually like the food at the cheesecake factory I ordered some spicy crispy beef thing with rice. The texture of the crispy beef was perfect, but the sauce was more sweet than spicy. No, I was not expecting ""Thai"" spicy, but I've had mild salsa spicier than that dish. I was just hoping for a little more kick. I've had the shrimp scampi and fresh grilled salmon and the seafood always tastes and smells fishy as if it isn't fresh.  Randy ordered the wasabi crusted seared ahi. I was shocked how big the slice of tuna was. It was really good, but still just lacking the kick I was expecting from the wasbi. Despite this, I think it's a decent deal for the price.  The decor is great, but the tables are a little too small. Granted, there were only two of us, but they stuck us at a table the size you normally see at a fast food joint for two. Thank goodness we only ordered an appetizer and an entree for each of us in addition to the drinks and breadbasket. We were struggling to find room for all the dishes. The restraurant is also usually a little too crowded for my taste no matter what time I've gone there. All in all, this is a good place to bring a date or have lunch with a group of friends for a slightly more special occasion than just plain hunger.  Picking up a cheesecake to go is a breeze though. There is a counter right up front and the service is quick.  Even though I do tend to eat here, I would really recommend eating somewhere else and just coming here for the dessert. The food deserves a 1 star, the cheesecake is a 5 star for sure, and so this place averages to a 3 star for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=660

Nancy T.,"Orange County, CA",405,1218,301,5.0,9/28/2010,"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants...but I do occassionally go to them. Cheesecake Factory is one of the few exceptions I'll make because they have such an extensive menu, so it's perfect for going to in big groups or small ones. All of my friends actually make fun of me because I pretty much have the entire menu memorized here, but I'm actually proud of my skills! ;) The portion sizes are outrageously large! About a year ago, they added a ""tapas"" menu, which has smaller bites for less money. These have become some of my staple items because the portion size is far more reasonable and the quality of the food is really good. I love the tuna tartare - the fresh tuna (none of that canned junk) tastes amazing against the right amount of avocado and comes served with these homemade chips. I also love their fried zucchini. It costs about the same amount as the one at Carl's Jr, only they give you a much larger quantity here and the quality of the zucchini is obviously much higher! The pizzettes are decent too - they have a really good thin crust, but they're a bit scarce on the toppings. In terms of entrees, I have a couple of main staples I always come back to. The factory combination of shrimp scampi and chicken madeira is my all-time favorite dish! The shrimp scampi is super buttery, garlicky, and just freaking delicious against al dente angel hair pasta! The chicken madeira has a really nice tangy sauce and comes soaked in mushrooms, melted cheese, and asparagus. If you do get this combo, make sure you ask for the pasta instead of the mashed potatoes - they'll usually let you substitute this for free; trust me, you'll want to because the pasta is SO yummy! I also really like their fish and chips, chicken littles, steak diane, cheesesteak, and the everything pizza. You can't really go wrong with any of those dishes! Btw, they have a really good chicken corn chowder soup, so try to get it if you can - it's usually the soup of the day on Saturdays. Onto the most important part! After all, this place IS called CHEESECAKE factory for a reason. They have an absurd variety of cheesecake here, but I like to keep it simple. My two favorites are the fresh strawberry and the oreo cheesecake. I go with the former when I'm in the mood for some fruity flavors and the latter when I just want some chocolate. There is another oreo cheesecake on the menu, but it's way too rich for my taste because they glob on a bunch of other chocolatey flavors too, so make sure you distinguish between the two if you decide to order it. I know I'm going to sound like a pig, but I've tried almost ALL of the cheesecake flavors here. If you like more indulgent cheesecakes, then I would recommend the white chocolate raspberry truffle (everyone always seems to like this one) or the chocolate tuxedo cream if you're a BIG chocolate lover. If you're a fan of coffee, the kahlua one is also really good, but again...just too strong for my taste - I love sweets, but I don't like desserts that are TOO sweet if that makes sense. I've also had their tiramisu, which wasn't bad, but definitely not like one I ate, which was made by chefs from Italy - so obviously, it'd be a bit unfair to compare. They have a really yummy warm apple crisp, but I think the one at TGIFriday's is comparable. Yeah, so I'm just a tad obsessed with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=660

I've eaten at Cheesecake many times often for birthdays with a huge party.  Nothing really impresses me with the place I feel like all their foods are good but not great...I did enjoy the ahi tempura roll last night which was surprisingly good but their salmon was bit dry and the steak (I ordered it rare) was over cooked.  I've had their pastas before and they are pretty good.  In the end I know I'll be going back to this place since someone will want to eat here for their birthday.

We had to wait a while (Memorial weekend, and prom night for many), and we were finally seated outside, which was fine. I had the barbeque ranch chicken salad, which comes with onion rings on top instead of croutons, and was enormous. Hubby had the spicy crispy beef, and ate every bite (except the bite I took - it was delicious!).  Their bread basket contains both warm sourdough and pumpernickel, and is wonderful.  The cheesecake was the only thing that I was a bit disappointed with; my husband had the tiramisu cheesecake, and neither of us was thrilled with it (yes, I had a bite, are you surprised, really?).  It had a shot of mocha whipped cream on top, which really didn't add much to the taste.

Anyway, about 20 minutes after we ordered, an expo came out and asked if it was me who ordered the shrimp pasta. I said no, i ordered the chicken and biscuits - which were subpar at best. The expo looked confused, walked away, then returned to tell me he thinks my order may have been deleted but i would probably be ok and my food would come out on time with everyone else's. My plate arrived 15 minutes after the first plate at our table was set down. I didn't complain because i know that won't solve anything except get me more fired up. So i tell you all, cheesecake factory is too busy for its own good. It's overpriced, its food is nothing to scream about, and its customers are easily forgotten in its madness.

Chris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3238,810,14322,4.0,2/25/2013,"Cheesecake Factory. Reminds me of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but instead of candy, they make cheesecake. There's 3 things you notice immediately about the restaurant. VARIETY, GINORMOUS PORTIONS, and of course, CHEESECAKE. Some people talk mad smack about this restaurant chain but I can't say that I remember having a bad experience unless the wait was too long. That usually happens in Marina Del Rey, Redondo Beach, or Newport Beach.  Maybe, it's because these locations are more touristy than the others or cause it's an upscale neighborhood. Whatever the reasons are, I enjoy the restaurant as well as their decently stocked bar. Recently, I also visited the Grand Lux Cafe in Las Vegas and got this weird feeling of deja-vu. They're sister restaurants from the same company, but that's another day, another review. Here's what gets my taste buds going when I visit the Brea location. @ Bread - wheat, white, and don't be shy about the butter. @ Boston House Salad - Boston lettuce, chopped bacon, egg, blue cheese, croutons, tomato, and of course, RANCH dressing. Basically, it's a cobb salad and sometimes I add chicken. @ Chicken Madeira - Sauteed chicken breast, asparagus, melted mozzarella cheese, covered with mushrooms and madeira sauce, and mashed potatoes. I soak the white bread into the madeira sauce and drag it around the plate. I've tried other versions of the Chicken Madeira at different restaurants and it just doesn't compare. @ Bistro Shrimp Pasta - Crispy battered shrimp, mushrooms, tomato and arugula, tossed with spaghettini and basil garlic lemon cream sauce. I smother the dish with tabasco sauce. YUM! @ Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon - Salmon with lemon sauce, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. Simple, clean, and my choice before a night of drinking debauchery. This dish just digests well for me cause it's not heavy or oily. @ Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake - How can you turn down this classic dessert? They're starting to promote this SkinnyLicious Menu with dishes that have fewer calories, but with the same familiar taste and I just disagree with that. I'd rather order something on the original menu and then work my ass a little harder at the gym.

A sweet & savory snack! -Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic: bow-tie pasta with chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce. It usually has great depth of flavor but past 2 times it has been kinda watery and bland =( -Renee's special: 1/2 sandwich, soup, AND salad. Really good deal!  I get the chicken-almond salad sandwich with their soup of the day, and caesar salad for $1 more. Bread is buttery and toasted. The chicken salad is delicious and flavorful. The caesar salad is well dressed and my favorite soup so far is their clam chowder (usually on fridays). Huge portion! -Caramel chicken and kobe burger are my boyfriends favs.=p Oh and don't forgert to save room for dessert!! It's called CHEESECAKE factory for a reason! My favorite is their WHITE CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY TRUFFLE! Raspberry swirl cheesecake with a cookie crust and topped with shaved white chocolate and whip cream. DELICIOUS! I always try to save room for this dessert. Service is usually good. Place is busy during lunch and weekends, so plan accordingly. Ambiance is nice and low-lit at night.

Which was unacceptable due to arriving 2 hours ahead of time for a no way dinner.  Other than that, dinner was amazing! We had two waitress's to take care of both sides, and the waitress's was soo nice! I wish I caught her name to recognize her on here, but she had short hair like a bob cut, and super sweet!

Neville T.,"Chino Hills, CA",87,22,30,4.0,8/9/2014,"So we went on July 30th, which was National Cheesecake Day, and it was moderately crowded. With that said, our party of four was seated fairly quickly, in around 25 minutes.  The food was what you would expect from a Cheesecake Factory, enormous portions that take a while to finish. The Jambalaya Pasta is really good and really spicy. Also, we ordered the Shepard's Pie and Seafood Gumbo and both those looked really good as well. For dessert, I went with the Red Velvet Cheesecake, which is what I always get. I recommend getting whatever cheesecake sounds good to you, because I'm sure that all of them are good. Unfortunately, the waitress we had (who's name slips my mind), was kind of slow. And she wasn't only slow for us, she was slow for the whole section of tables that she was serving. A total of 2 hrs passed from when we were seated to when we left because of the slow service. The time it took to get the food out was really long, but we had the free bread so we were satisfied.

My brother also got off the car to have a cig while waiting.  Quickly found parking with luck, and see my mom waving at me and my bro. Yay, no wait! Walked in, looking for the wife and kid who had seated, couldn't see them (big place), and my mom started asking around and was IGNORED by two busy waitresses. So it end up with us three each going down an asle like idiots to look ourselves.  4 adults and a baby on high chair, two sets of utensils on the table. Friendly waitress with a poker face quickly took our drink order and left, came back with drinks and announced she will be back with my coffee, then came back with my coffee and cream, no sugar. Waved the waitress back for sugar and TWO more sets of utensils, we have annoyed the waitress at this point judging from the poker face growing fearsome. Another waitress brought the table bread, still no utensils. Finally got my sugar and ONE set of utensils, my brave wife asked for another set. I kept my head down when the friendly waitress brings the fourth set and announced ""here you go"". My wife whispered ""she looks mad""... Yes, I know.  Round of main entrees served by other waitresses, handing us the plate, oily plates, for us to put on the table ourselves. While the waitresses quickly turned around attending to the busy lunch time, left us struggling moving the appetizer plates out to fit the entree plates. None of them thought of to clear the table.  Halfway through the meal, our waitress stopped by querying for coke refills and left before I could stop her, as I was waiting for her inquiry on coffee refill, I had 1/5 of cup left.  Potatoes with the two Sunday brunch orders were over fried, dried, and tough to bite. Angel hair pasta had an 1/8 inch oil left on the plate by the time my bro was almost done with it. Fettuccine was too salty.  Monte Cristo and Crab-hash was good, though we've given up on its accompanying potatoes.  Finally saw smile on our waitress' face when she brought our check. I guess she was happy to see us go. No regards on the empty coffee cup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=720

Sergio I.,"Orlando, FL",112,18,24,5.0,1/22/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is located in the Brea Mall. it offers late night dining. the property entrance is magnificence. They have a nice out door seating and the landscape is well cared for. we had a 20min wait on a late friday night. The service was decent. The staff behind the bakery was very cheerful and friendly.  The design of the property both outside and especially inside were magnificent. Lighting is dim and intimate. Dress code is casual, but most guest are well dressed. Children were present and well behaved.  The menu was overwhelmingly desirable with plenty to choose from and something for everyone. We ordered the Ahi Carpaccio, Delicious, but tiny in portion. The Chicken Bellagio was on the special menu and prepared to perfection. The Thai Chicken Pasta had a strong peanut sauce taste but subtle and good!.  Warning: The cocktails are way overpriced for the amount of alcohol it contains. I didn't care for the caribbean cooler but the Pomegranate Margarita is flavorful. our bill came out to about $90 with 4 drinks and key lime cheesecake which i have yet to taste.

Now let me begin by saying my main pet peeves are as follows: (A) chain restaurants and (B) smörgsbord menus cluttered with 'Chipotle' this and 'oriental' that.  Stick with a couple things and do them well.  Here's the rundown: Avocado egg rolls- the sauce was waaay too sweet. Willy Wonka himself would have died from diabetes upon tooth- to- wonton contact.  Otherwise, its a fried shell stuffed with avocado.  Live like you're dying- challenge thy palate! the Navajo- fry bread? Really can't see anything wrong with further infusing grease into refined carbs (my poor poor intestinal tract).  But dear sweet baby Jesus, I needed a weed whacker to get through all the damn vegetation. I'm a fan of lettuce, really I am... on those rare DIEt stints, but if it looks like a salad and taste like a salad... by golly, its a damn salad!  The chicken.... so unremarkable I seriously though about omitting my two cents on the matter. White choc macadamia nut cheesecake- I glanced at the calorie count on this bad boy and asked the waitress, ""Is this for the whole pie or a single slice?""  She looked at me like I was boo boo the fool.  I'll take it!  The whipped cream was delightfully frothy but it garnished the entire plate!  The slice was minute in comparison. The crust was a nice firm Blondie and the cake was packed with nuts and caramel.  It was rich!

Eugene K.,"Irvine, CA",11,34,,1.0,3/8/2008,"I'm generally not that picky about food and I've been to 2 other Cheesecake Factories (one in San Jose and the other in San Diego) and this place kills it for everyone.  I loved Cheesecake factory until I went to this particular one.  Since my friends and I live in the OC, I kept suggesting to go eat at CCF and my friends were like, ""Why?  Cheesecake Factory isn't that great.""  I was so surprised that anyone would say such a thing until they finally wanted to give it another chance.  OMG that was a big mistake!  This one in the Brea Mall really stinks in ALL ASPECT of having a restaurant.  The Pasta Di Vinci is one of my favorite dishes that I used to get in San Diego and I've also tried it at the one in San Jose and they were both really good.  In Brea, not only was the sauce dry and the pasta slightly harder than I expected, the chicken really tasted like it was frozen and thrown in the microwave for a couple minutes.  I was patient about my initial tasting and asked if I can have it fixed, but the manager in charge of the time said that the other Cheesecake Factories were cooking it wrong. The waiters were also unhelpful.  They would rarely come around asking if I needed a refill and after they sensed that I wasn't having even a decent experience, they ignored me completely!  I wasn't even showing any form of distaste towards the waiters since I know it's not their fault if the food wasn't to my standards.  The service was so poor that I had to walk up to them and get their attention if I needed anything. I'm taking my friends to the Cheesecake factory in San Diego to nullify their belief that the food at the chains are horrible, but I can't blame them for thinking this way because of this one in Brea.  There is quite a distance to drive all the way down just to try their food, but if you can go to another restaurant while in Orange County you should really avoid this particular place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=880

First off, I called in to make a reservation. They said they don't do that but they will take my name, desired time, and number in my party... sounds like a reservation but the woman on the phone assured me it was not. So me and the two others in my group arrive. It was absolutely PACKED. like shoulder to shoulder, sliding my way toward the front counter congestion. I told her my name and that I had phoned in earlier. As she looked me up, I noticed the other hostess explaining there would be an hour and a half wait to another patron. I was worried and prepared to leave if my hostess uttered the same unfortunate remark. To my surprise, she looked up, gave me a pager and said it would be 15 minutes. So much for the ""no reservations"" idea. I was happy to have called. So we waited... and waited. I asked her where we were at in the line after about 30 minutes. She said we were next without looking at her computer. I figured she was guessing at best and asked the manager. He said ""coming up."" Well, that doesn't help me. Anyhow, we were finally seated after 40 minutes. This was the most annoying experience due to the fact it was so crowded in the lobby and outside. The food was mediocre. The cheesecake is quite good but you can just as easy order it from the front to-go. I chose not to dwell on the food or waiter service mostly because it was unremarkable and a bit boring.

I ordered medium well steak diane and my friend ordered the steak diane medium well and chicken madeira combination. When our meals came some of our steak pieces were way over well done and if I had to compare it to something it would be as if you were attempting to saw through a block of cardboard. Shortly after the waitress took our plates to replace them, the manager came out and made the comment that they cut into all of our steak pieces and only 35% was over done but (at this point he rolled his eyes at us) they were going to replace it anyways. If he was replacing our meals anyways was it necessary to roll his eyes at us and make a snide comment about how only 35% of our steak were way past well done? As far as I'm concerned if you order steak in a restaurant and your steak is near cardboard status it needs to be replaced.

The service is generally very polite and friendly, if at times a little slow. We usually don't notice unless our drinks get exceptionally low and nobody comes to refill them.

Michael H.,"Walnut, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/17/2012,"Today I went to Cheesecake Factory with my girlfriend to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and everything was great until we found out that our utensils were already used by some previous customer who dined before us. It started when we sat and our utensils looked a bit dirty; however I just cleaned it with my napkin and didn't really think much of it. Things went well as our waiter gave us our bread; however after I used my knife to put butter on my bread and eat it, I realized that my spoon had remnants of chocolate stuck to it, Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I just assumed that they may have missed washing it and that only the spoon was used. So I asked my girlfriend about her utensils and her spoon had dried chocolate stains on her spoon and other marks on the rest of her utensils, which makes me really believe that these were used by someone before us. Realizing this after already using my knive and fork, I lost my appetite and spoke to the manager. Atleast the manager was really nice and said that we did not have to pay for the meal which we did not eat because of our lost appetite. The only reason I gave this place a 2 star was because the staff was friendly and the manager was nice. I would NOT return to this Cheesecake Factory. I never had a problem like this anywhere I have eaten in my life. I expected a slightly upper tier restaurant like this would never have this sort of problem; however I was wrong. My girlfriend and I just ended up leaving and left us in a bitter mood; making this an unpleasant night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=860
Mermaid Princess A.,"Torrance, CA",0,12,,5.0,9/30/2008,"I really enjoyed this CF location.  The restaurant's outer and inner design is unlike anything I've seen... it's very creative and unique.  Very beautiful.  Our server was really nice, and she checked on us as needed and not too often (I hate servers who interrupt your meal every 5 minutes to check on you).  The food was really really good.  There is another CF location I went to a few years back and the food was just okay, but I was pleasantly surprised with the food at this location as it's superb. I really recommend the avocado roll appetizer.  It's really good and I liked it a lot.  I would DEFINITELY go to this location for special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries because it's fancy enough to dress up if you want, but still a chain restaurant if you wanna go casual.  The ambiance is great too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=860
Lynn S.,"Brea, CA",0,10,,3.0,6/2/2010,"As usual, the food is amazing as ever at The Cheesecake Factory. Why the 3 star review then? This location seems to always dissapoint me. From the lackluster service to the inability to cook steaks/cheeseburgers to the requested temp. That being said, I would suggest that if you ever visit this location to know what you want quickly, get it in, and get out (oh and don't order a burger or a steak haha).  My favorite appetizers are the avocado eggrolls and the buffalo blasts. They are both exquisite. I would even suggest getting both and saving half your entree for lunch the next day. My absolute favorite entree is their Chicken Bellagio. It is on their seasonal menu but has stuck around for a while so hopefully it becomes part of the regular menu! It is served over pasta and has this flavorful but not too heavy sauce topped with arugala and prisocuitto. I could easily get this dish each and every time I go to Cheesecake. Another entree to try out would be their Bistro Shrimp Pasta.  And of course, you should always save room for dessert when coming here. If you get the Godiva or the Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake you won't be dissapointed. However, I have heard that their other dessert options (not cheesecake) are also good, but haven't gotten around to trying them yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=860

If i had known that then i would've ordered something else off the regular dinner menu.  If the meatloaf was good, then I would not have cared as much.  But, my food tasted and looked like it came from hometown buffet.  To top it all off she forgot the soup, but I just wanted to leave.  My cousins and I didn't even finish half way, and just asked for the check.  I am NEVER coming back here, and no one else should.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=860

Customer Service, in my opinion sets apart a good from a bad restaurant. Not to mention, we spent less having complete dinner here for 3, than a not so decent dinner at the Yardhouse in Brea for 2, with a not so good service all together. It's not the same kind of place, I know.  But consumers, do spend money to get good food, and good service.  It doesn't matter what kind of restaurant, the concept of dinning is the same.  Our server definitely earned 22% of our tip that night.  Can not wait for the CheesCake Factory to open in Cerritos, which will be closer to Downey.  This will definitely be a choice for dinning in my book.  Hopefully, the servers they hire would be as good if not better than Jennifer in Brea :') Thanks again for the outstanding service & for serving great food.  We definitely had a good dinning experience with CheeseCake Factory!

John P.,"La Habra, CA",5,40,451,3.0,3/26/2014,"This was only my second time coming to the Cheesecake Factory. Well we will start off with the wait not so bad it was a solid (15) fifteen minutes not that bad at all and we waited for maybe 15-20. When we were called in we walked up to the desk as two other parties walked in after us however the other two parties kind of made their way up in front of us and with out even really looking at the tickets both of these parties where sat before us. Now I know I could have said something but I did not want to make a seen been with my family. The hosts really did not seem like they even knew we existed leaded us back to our table sat us and walked away uttering a quick word of your waiter will be with you soon. The waitress was a girl by the name of Taylor and she was awesome and wonderful really took great care of us the whole time. My Kids had the chicken strips with fries and fruit bowels that I know of the kids had no problem with their fries or chicken strips however the fruit bowels looked like some one in the back might have been opening up sealed packets from the nearest grocer and putting them in their bowel (not to tasty or fresh tasting either). My wife had a good dish called the Crispy Chicken Costoletta in many ways this was a good choice it was very tasty. I was not so lucky one of the many things I don't like about restaurants is choosing my dish because you just never know what to get and you want to enjoy what you get but you are worried that you are going to spend a lot of money on something you will regret that you ordered. So been the fact that this is only my second time here I always think to my self I will order the easiest thing on the menu thinking to my self that there is no way they can miss this up. Well I was wrong I ordered the California Cheesesteak and it was like something I could have made at home dry, dry and dry not. The meat was tough and over cooked really did not enjoy it at all. Well lets get to the desert cause I will be honest if you want a great desert then go to the Cheesecake Factory one of my kids got a regular kids Sunday he loved it I got the Rocky Road Sundae with House made Marshmallow it was what dreams are made of oh awesome if you go get this for desert. However my wife got the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore and again a huge hit for our family we loved it. Again our waitress (Taylor) was awesome in every way she really took care of us how ever she could. So to be honest with you Yelpers it comes down to this if you want desert and want it to be a date or something special go to the Cheesecake Factory. But if you want a good main course be choosy and make sure you pick something you know you will like and hope it comes the way you wanted it to. The place is loud and looks like something out of Los Vegas it does get busy. Kids will be ok here I think my kids seemed to do ok and they are the ones to not want to sit in one place for to long. The atmosphere is very dating kind of girly and rich feeling along with the price of the food. Anyhow again like I said I have only been to this Cheesecake Factory two times in my life fare warning.

J H.,"Brea, CA",0,25,1,1.0,9/15/2008,"My friend and I met for lunch on 9-9-08 and most of the tables were empty, which is a surprise for this place.  Maybe we learned why the place was empty when we were seated at a booth on the west side of the restaurant.  There were flies buzzing all around us and we complained to the waitress when she arrived to take our drink order.  She said she was aware of the problem and has complained to the management herself, but she said management won't do anything about it.  She also said that the flies seem to be worse on the west side of the restaurant.  As she's talking to us, I count 6 flies landed on the post behind by friend's head.  We asked to move to another part of the restaurant to see if it would be better.  It was better in the middle, but we still had one fly land on our table.  We requested to see the manager and he said that he was aware of the problem and they were going to have pest control come in that evening (after what the waitress said it was hard to believe this).  He said that this is a problem he doesn't know how to fix because the flies continue to come in even after the ones inside have been killed.  It didn't sound like he really intended to try and fix the problem.  Needless to say, the thought of how many flies might be on the food in the kitchen just is too gross to contemplate.  I think it will be a long time before I can venture into this place again.

Rae A.,"San Diego, CA",21,110,435,4.0,12/26/2017,"Can I just say this place is lit for the holidays? We waited maybe 30/40 minutes which I guess isn't too bad? Our server was super cheery which made it fun and she also hooked us up with like 3 baskets of free bread, which is always a win. Our food did take some time to come out but it was understandable.  Fried Zucchini:  4/5 It was crispy, not that oily and served with ranch. I personally have had better fried zucchini for cheaper but you know, you're paying for the atmosphere. It wasn't a huge serving and it as small slices of zucchini, very petite and cute. Fried Calamari: 4.5/5 It wasn't oily, squid was tender, served with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Was a good serving size and came out pretty hot. It was well seasoned, not really sure how much it cost but rentals said it was pretty good.  Bistro Shrimp Pasta: 4.5/5 It was a huge portion filled with lots of mushrooms and shrimp. It was creamy and coated with the pesto sauce but it wasn't overwhelming. It wasn't a heavy pasta dish but it was filling and it was hard to stop.  Miso Salmon:  3/5 It tasted more like teriyaki than miso. It was a little sweet. It was served with a lot more rice to salmon ratio. If you're asian, you've probably had better rice.  Cajun Jambalaya 4/5 Well, I wasn't able to try this for diet reason as per usual but my father finished it and it looked like there was a lot and also that's all I can say.  Eggplant Parmesan:  3/5 It was a little oily and had a lot of cheese, which to some people is not a bad thing. It comes with three slices of eggplant heavily coated in breadcrumbs and topped with mozzarella and marinara. It comes with a small side of pesto that was pretty much just empty carbs. It was not hot surprisingly.  New York Steak: 5/5 Wow who would have thought that steak here was pretty good? She ordered it medium well and it came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Pretty good I think because again, she finished it to the last bite.  Cheesecake Factory is another American food chain that has great service, great bread, and a great ambience. It's a good place to celebrate and as much as I try not to eat sweets, the cheesecakes are honestly, the icing on the cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea

She was completely patient and explain to me how it would work and was so nice I felt the compulsion to write this.  Update: So disappointed, went through curbside pick up and grabbed my order only to return home and realize that no utensils were included.

I didn't get to look at the menu too deeply because I was having a conversation but I saw that they offer a Veggie Burger in their Skinnylicious menu. It comes with a green salad a light dressing. I am not sure if this is a vegan because of the bread but I made sure no mayo or cheese was added. As for the taste, the veggie burger is really delicious.

He could have taken a different route in dealing with guests but he chose to be rude and disrespectful. I will start going to a different location. 1 Star was for the customer service by the MGR only. Btw managers name is CHRISTOPHER. Customer service skills are needed by this guy so deal with the other MGR's or go to a different location.  Update to above.... food was actually bad. I had that lemon chicken and angel hair pasta dish. The chicken seemed like it was microwaved then thrown in a pan of oil to give it some sort of ""grilled"" feel to it. Was really fatty as well. Poor dish, I don't recommend that. To be honest, the only thing I liked, was leaving. That whole night was shot from the beginning. The OTHER manager later took only half our bill off essentially saving us only $50 on the bill. That didn't help. Terrible customer service trumps everything else. Your food could be terrible (like above), but if your customer service is on point then my review would be positive. Wasn't the case.

The cheese was perfectly melted. It was accompanied by some crispy, salty fries. It was an excellent meal and I can't wait to come back and try something else.  Out of the three main dishes I tried I liked all three. Tried the burger, some pasta, and chicken tenders. The tomato based pasta sauce tasted home made and the chicken was good quality, though a bit under-seasoned. Still very good with the BBQ dipping sauce though. Just don't like ordering bland items and having to resort to sauces to enjoy it. Should be good on its own and the sauce should be there for a kick if desired in my opinion. Didn't like the dessert. We went with their Dulce De Leche cheesecake, but it tasted like caramel. Big difference! Next time I'm picking the Original! Best burger I've had all year!

I love Cheesecake Factory! Their menu is endless!! I kid you not, their menu probably has 15 pages minimum lol. Anyways, I go for their pasta because they honestly have the best pasta dishes. AND THEIR BREAD! I love their bread!! Apparently they just released a new specialty menu last week, so we were able to try some of their new dishes!  I ordered a Peach Bellini blended for my drink and my bf got a Whiskey Smash (*strong!). Both drinks were really good! Sweet and fruity.  For starters, my bf and I ordered the avocado egg rolls and the truffle bacon grilled cheese sticks. The egg rolls were okay -- the avocado to egg roll ratio was too much. I thought it had a little too much avocado. The truffle grilled cheese were good! I loved how they put whole strips of bacon instead of pieces of it. As for my main dish, I first ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. I'm never picky with my food, but this dish was really sweet for my liking. I was hoping for a more savory chipotle flavor, but it was definitely not the case. As much as I was embarrassed to ask if I could change my dish, Lou was super nice about changing it for me anyway. (super plus!!) He let me change my dish to Pasta Nepolitana, one of their new specialties and Bo0o0O0o0o0YYY this was soo good! I loved it so much, it is a must try!!

Meg K.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,10,,1.0,1/3/2018,"TL; DR down below.  There were 2-3 big parties that were arriving shortly after we arrived. We got an estimated wait time of 20 mins for myself and my husband. They handed us a buzzer/pager and we decided to wait inside closer to the entry way. Why? We didn't want to block the walkway for people exiting or block other people from coming in to be with their party or to put their name down for a table. About 30-40 people were waiting to be seated, but we put our names down before they did, had a buzzer, were only two people, and the restaurant was clearing out A LOT of tables anyways. We waited for 45-60 minutes. Did not hear our name and our buzzer did not chime, light up, buzz, or signal to us that we were being called. After seeing all the parties go before us and many others who arrived way later than us, my husband went up to the host desk to ask them what was going on. They said that they had called our names already, but that they would put us at the top of the list for a table and would be about another 5 minutes. We were then FINALLY called by the host, but I asked them why we weren't actually told about our table being ready (buzzer or in person) especially since we were being very courteous to them, other patrons, and I'm pretty sure the fire codes/regulations. The host then apologized and said that sometimes the buzzers don't work... As we were talking, the person (who would later be seating us) didn't get the memo that we were already at the desk trying to get answers as to what happened. We noticed that she was calling for us with a normal volume that would not have reached to anyone unless they were REALY listening near the cheesecake display case and maybe the one seat in the waiting area. She just stood near the host desk, said the name as if she were talking normally, and gave up. No walking closer to the guests waiting near the entry way...no walking in general...  She gave up after saying our name three times because we ""didn't arrive"" and told the host that we were a ""no show"" all annoyed. The host then had to break it to her that we were already right here... A considerable amount of people have now left the restaurant and there were still about 7 people waiting to be seated. She tries to quickly change her attitude to a cheery one and sat us in a booth. We tried to forget the whole ordeal because who wants to ruin date night? However, as we were in the middle of us being seated, a waitress then complains to this person in front of us behind our booth's tiny pillar. We hear every word and this lasted for a minute or two. The person then says that a waitress will be right with us. It took 15 minutes for that waitress to come by to ask us if we wanted anything to drink. We asked for water and gave her our order right away. She came back with the waters and our bread. Our crab bites came sometime later after we had already finished half of our bread. So maybe 10-15 minutes after we ordered? No offer on any bread refills throughout the entire time. Our entree food arrived 45 minutes after we were seated, 30 minutes after we ordered because of that 15 minute wait time with our waitress.  The food at the time was good, but this entire experience wasn't. We basically complained to each other the entire meal about how this whole experience was basically about 2 hours waiting for food. I also opened my leftovers today and saw that they had my asparagus heads sticking out of the take out box when there's clearly room for it to be entirely in the box and a 2 inch white hair on top of/slightly embedded in my mashed potatoes... TL;DR: Don't trust the buzzers/pagers. Don't trust hearing your name unless you camp out near the host desk. Don't be surprised to see staff drama/attitude. Don't expect to be seen at a reasonable time after being seated. Expect the food to be okay-good, but if you get a takeout box, ask if you could pack it yourself. If they do it, don't be surprised to find extra unwanted things or bad packaging.  If any of this happens to you at the restaurant, demand to talk to someone right away. Don't think the bad experience will turn around because it likely it won't. We didn't complain right away for this reason and because we didn't want to spend any more time than we already had there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=20

Ken S.,"Brea, CA",0,44,,2.0,11/29/2017,"Wish I could give this a better rating because I go here so often but there are a few things to note about this particular location. 1. The food. I always order the same thing every time, a pasta dish. But no matter when I go, it always tastes different. It's great, don't get me wrong. But it's inconsistent. Sometimes it's spicy, sometimes it's light, sometimes it's rather tasteless. But I crave that pasta dish, so I continue to eat here. 2. The servers (for the most part) Many of them seem to hate their jobs. I get it though, serving in the food industry is one of the most stressful jobs but man, it's obviously difficult for some to maintain a smile or even a positive attitude. The service is hit or miss. 3. The food runners. Some in particular are just the worst. They just leave the food and go... there's no proper manners or simple respect. Not even a ""enjoy your meal"" or ""can I get anything else for you?"" It's just very cold and almost insulting; as if we are dogs getting fed kibble. It's pretty lame and I guarantee many people feel the same. I get it though, they have other orders to take care of, but it's not rocket science to have a positive attitude and treat customers with respect. Also, if you order a pasta dish, don't expect them to ask you if you need shredded Parmesan cheese. They don't care and you won't get it unless you wait there for an hour trying to flag down a server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=20

They do their best to cater to your needs, whether it be with food or anything else, and always have a smile on their face. Their portions are HUGE - I got full off a salad to the point that I didn't have enough room for a slice of cheesecake (which are also all phenomenal). What does occasionally worry me mid-meal is the amount of calories in everything they have (salads often are almost, if not over, 1000 calories), and their cheesecakes are over 1000 calories for 1 slice, but these thoughts have never actually stopped me from stuffing my face.  This place can get pretty crowded on special occasions (e.g. holidays, graduations, etc), so be sure to plan accordingly.

Justin H.,"Orange County, CA",419,177,1097,5.0,5/26/2017,"To me, The Cheesecake Factory is one of those few chain restaurants that are tried and true. They consistently serve wonderful foods that are of great quality. It tells you something about a restaurant that has been around for ages and yet still attracts crowds and crowds of people every weekend! I actually tried something a bit different from my usual dishes. I tried the baja chicken tacos. The tacos were actually really really good, and I love that the tacos were homemade. This time I did not get a cheesecake, but um... must I really talk about the amazing cheesecakes that the Cheesecake Factory makes? I think it goes without saying that they make some awesome cheesecakes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=20

Lynette N.,"San Dimas, CA",74,31,9,1.0,9/24/2017,"I just had dinner at this place with my family and I've never been more disappointed... After agreeing to wait 50 minutes to be seated, we were seated along with 2 other groups of people.. Everyone's orders were taken and everyones food came out at the time, except for ours. We waited a good amount of time before asking about our food and when we finally did, the server rudely told us the other tables got their food before us because they were seated and ordered before us which was a complete lie.. On top of all that, we learned she never put our order in so she lied and made a mistake - I can look beyond the mistake but the rudeness and lie are unacceptable.  Overall, the service was horrible and the quality of the food was too.. The Cheesecake Factory used to be a decent place to eat but it is overpriced, the quality of the food is no good and the service isn't either.

There's a lot going on but they also all sound really good! Here are my recommendations: Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic: It's seriously really good. If you like anything garlic and caramelized onions, then this is for you.  Strawberry lemonade: The cup has a rim of sugar so it must be good!

Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,4.0,6/25/2017,"So we went to Cheesecake Factory for an early lunch as business called.  We got there right when they opened to avoid the crush of people.  THe crush came about 15 minutes after we arrived.  and within 30 minutes, the place was packed.  I was shocked. That being said, we were sat promptly and our server was great and very attentive.  We kinda customized our order and she nailed every item on our order so it was done the way we wanted.  That was really great to see. We had the bread served with our appetizer.  The dark bread is really tasty.  However, when will  restaurants know that people do not like ice cubes for butter.  You cannot spread it as it rips your bread to shreds.  There is no excuse for that.  So, as usual we had to smash the butter underneath our plates to make it so we could use it.  Very annoying. The Fried zucchini was honestly one of the best flavored zucchini I have ever had.  Great flavor on all fronts and I wanted so much more. The salads were prepared as we like them and no, we did not have any frogs in them (sorry BJ's) thank god!  LOL The entrees came and oh my goodness, the portions are very large.  Absolutely shareable portions.  We had the eggplant parmesan with the spaghetti with a nice pesto sauce.  THe sauce was on point and the pasta was done nicely.  So, we were off to a pretty good start. To finish off, we had the Strawberry Cheesecake.  I asked for extra strawberries.  Needless to say I was very surprised that I was served eight very large strawberries.  It was a nice touch and we all ate until we were very full. So, I was pleasantly surprised by this visit.  The service was a 5, the overall food was a 4 and the overall experience was a very high 4.  That butter thing, just bugs the heck out of me.  LOL. Needless to say, this place serves good food and the menu has a huge variety and something for everyone.  Go during the off hours or you will be with the crush of people.  I would absolutely recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=20

Service was definitely on the poor side, as we constantly had to wave down the server. The calamari appetizer was very salty. The main dishes, both pasta, had about half a chicken breast (if that). It's sad but this is the why we visit chain restaurants less and less. After a $70 dinner, and a poor experience, we probably won't be returning for quite a while.

Artichoke Dip: Great starter as well, they give you a ton of dip! Really rich flavor! Pasta Napoletana: My favorite pasta dish in the entire world. So rich and yummy. Asian Pear Martini: My favorite drink on the menu, fruity but also strong. Crisp flavor. Overall, I'm here frequently and the food is always great. This location does a good job of keeping the quality in each dish consistent across different visits.

The chicken dish we got was pretty good but i couldn't eat the chicken/mango salad. The dressing combo with the salad just didn't go together well. Experience was just ok.

Also got the green salad with balsamic and a lot of the leaves were way too big. I shouldn't have to cut a salad. The Salted Caramel Cheesecake was ok, nothing special.

We sat at one of the high top tables in the bar area after speaking with the very nice hostesses at the entrance. Our server was sweet and attentive (wish I had caught her name - I think she was also tending bar if that helps. Just want management to know how great of a job she did). Overall the service was excellent.  Drinks: Mom and I ordered mimosas, which were refreshing and tasty. It seemed like they were prepared with fresh orange juice, which made them even tastier.  Food: We ordered the tamale cakes, the Thai lettuce wraps, the ahi tartare, and the stuffed mushrooms. The tamales were our favorite - so flavorful and delicious with a little kick to them. The lettuce wraps are a classic appetizer here and great as usual - I love the array of sauces and fillings, and the chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The tartare with fresh avocado was scrumptious. Mushrooms were awesome - loved the sauce they were in - though they were a bit on the small side. Maybe I just wished they were bigger because they were so good! (On a side note, kudos to the staff for having to remember and be trained in such an extensive menu! I worked in bars and restaurants throughout college and grad school so I know how challenging this can be. I'm always impressed by the staff's knowledge and recall whenever I come here.)  We *almost* ordered cheesecake but we were just too full. Standing favorites include the Reese's flavor, the classic strawberry, and the pumpkin pecan when they have it.  My family and I have always loved this particular location and have never had a bad meal or a bad experience here. Some of the more critical reviews seem to have been written by people whose expectations are kind of ridiculous (like coming in with a huge party on a Saturday night and expecting to be seated and served immediately) or people who have no awareness of or appreciation for how it works behind the scenes at a restaurant.

The portions are so large that you get 2 meals for the price of one with all the left overs you will be going home with.  The free bread is the bomb and service is always good.

They seriously took my review seriously and instead of being petty about it, they decided to make it right. This was actually about a month ago when it happened, so mind you I'm a bit overdue on this updated review.  I was messaged by Craig from Guest Services who apologized for the last incident that occurred when my boyfriend had food poisoning. They sent over a letter explaining that they would look into the situation that last occurred and after a few days, sent me an electronic gift card to make it up to us and give it another shot. I don't know how they figured it out but my boyfriend happened to be in town that exact week and so I took him to dinner with the gift card before he left back home to Vancouver.  This time around, the food didn't disappoint and Neal's tummy was feeling just as good as it was when he took that first bite at Cheesecake that evening.

Will G.,"Brea, CA",46,61,298,1.0,6/24/2017,"Late decision to meet up w friends at Cheesecake Factory. It's been a while since I've stepped into one of these.  It was CRAZY BUSY - but the wait was less than 20 minutes.  I was sat at a booth, which I didn't like - big guy and need a little extra room - and waited all of 15 seconds to be sat at another table. AWESOME!! Waiter is nice but I'm guessing not very much of an active listener. Told him twice to please bring lemon w water. I'll try a 3rd time.  Sat at a table then my friends decided to sit at the bar - so I moved. Usually I wouldn't cause I rather sit and have conversation but I'm good.  Ordered Chicken Pizza Style and after almost 20 minutes - was told they were out of it. My whole party ordered it and so now no one was getting it and its the ONLY reason we all showed up.  So we decided to order the Chicken Romano - which I'm told is almost the same thing...which then asks the question, Why can't they make the original? Maybe the kitchens frustrated.   The Chicken Romano was fine. It looked like it was simply thrown on the plate in a fit of frustration. Finally, in all honesty it was nothing to really write home about. I'll say this...the pasta was cooked well for a chain restaurant so that's the plus.  When the bill came - and after waiting next to several dirty plates as the person next to me left and the area was never bussed by either the bart beer or the bar back (but they had time to chuckle and giggle - not so much as the iced tea was comped for the trouble.  You would think that even after they knew that we had waited over almost 30 minutes BEFORE we were informed they had run out and then waited even longer to get the food they would make some sort of gesture other than simply saying - I just found out we are out of that dish.  But, this is what happens when chain restaurants get so big they don't fee they need to pay attention to why people eat there and what customer service is all about.  Like I mentioned before - it had been a long time since I stepped into a Cheesecake Factory...I guess I was right to stay away.  What started as a pleasant experience quickly became a bad, but salvageable, experience - that wasn't salvaged.  I do hope you folks start paying attention to what is really important when people CHOOSE your restaurant to dine at - and stop taking your customers for granted.  If this is your choice to dine at - the menu is WAY BUSY - but the food, if they don't run out  is pretty good.   I'm obviously bummed about the experience and so my Star count reflects it.  There are better places to go where the service is good and the customer service is excellent - find and frequent those places. You'll experience what a good dining experience actually is. Take care.  Happy grubbing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=60

When it was placed on our table today, the cake looked completely different than before, the portion was half the size and they DEFINITELY changed the recipe. It no longer tastes the same at all. Instead of having more cake, it's just layers of chocolate cream and fudge that's super sweet.  I wasn't complaining or anything I was just so shocked that the cake looked and tasted so different. But our waitress (Kara) immediately starting defending herself and saying that corporate changed everything and it's none of her business. I didn't even say anything directed at her, but as a waitress if you see that your customer is so upset with something, you really should be more kind or try to see if there's something else you can do about it.  And when I was still debating if I should ask if there's something she can do about it, she came to our table and just said ""let me get a box for you"".

The egg rolls are good, but not as good as the ones from cpk or bj's. The miso salmon is allllways bomb! Don't be fooled though- just because it's salmon doesn't mean it's healthy.

Ordered Items: Crab cakes, Ahi Carpaccio, and Sheppard's pie.  I'm not a fan of chain restaurants at all, but I would probably say The Cheese Cake Factory is my favorite. They offer a large variety of lunch or dinner options, also Vegan, Vegetarian, and Gluten free options ad well. They start you off with delicious warm honey wheat and fresh sour dough bread. The service is almost always fast and polite. I'm sorry to report that I didn't catch the person who helped us last night, but she was amazing; she even let us try the soup of the day, which I thought was good, but my mom thought it was the consistency of baby food (LOL). We started off with Crab Cakes, there were 3 large crab cakes served with tartar sauce and some other sauce that I had no clue what it was, but it was delicious. Then our meals came out shortly after, I ordered the Ahi carpaccio, according to The Cheese Cake Factory this is a small plate, but it was a  good sized square plate filled with Ahi Tuna topped with garlic, onions and seasoning pared with wasabi, ginger and seasoned ponzu sauce. I thought it was perfect and fresh. The momma bear ordered a Sheppard's pie, that was a HUGE bowl of meat, veggies, and topped with mashed potatoes. I thought it was salty and she told me she wished the meat was more tender but wasn't completely unhappy with it.

Brianna A.,"Whittier, CA",42,51,49,5.0,12/12/2015,"Came here tonight for my sister's birthday and it was a 45 minute wait. Not too bad for a Saturday night. Service: The service was exceptional here! I wasn't able to catch our server's name in the beginning but she was patient while we all took our time looking through the menu and deciding on what to order but checked in on us in a timely manner. She had such a positive energy that really made the night special.  Food: Last time I came here I ordered the Jambalaya and was totally in love with all the flavors of the shrimp and sausage! But lately I've been really into Eggplant Parmesans, so I decided to go with that. My plate came with 4 eggplants covered with cheese and a side of pesto pasta. The pasta was okay but the eggplant was DELICIOUS. It was such a huge portion for about $14-15 that I was only able to eat 2 eggplants and less than half of the pasta. Well worth it! Cheesecake: Our table decided to order 3 slices of cheesecake and share so we can all try different kinds. My sister loves the original cheesecake so we ordered a slice along with the Oreo cheesecake and the new Salted Caramel cheesecake. The cheesecake slices are big and so rich and creamy that you definitely won't be able to finish one by yourself. The Oreo is verrry chocolate-y and was a tad bit too much for me. I didn't care too much for the Salted Caramel but 4 people at my table loved it! And you can never go wrong with the original!  Overall it was a great experience and everyone was happy with their food. In the end, including the cheesecakes, it averaged to about $20 per person, not including tip.

Janel W.,"Danville, CA",3,26,5,2.0,4/28/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here before going to a Ducks game a couple of weeks ago for a quick dinner. They seated us right away, in an area near the windows on the right side past the cheesecake counter. HELPFUL TIP: if they seat you in this area, ASK TO MOVE.  That seating area was disturbing. There were fruit flies everywhere, and they were flying into our drinks, food, and faces. I think they were coming from the windows. We let the host know that there were a bunch of flies and that we wanted to move. She had to go ""talk to someone"" then came back and told us we could sit in a booth right across from where we were originally sitting. That was no help at all AND we had to move our food and drinks by ourselves. I don't know about you, but that's kind of embarrassing. I've rarely had to move seats in a restaurant, and when it happens, there's normally at least 2 people that move your food. That's just restaurant etiquette. Also, you know what else is restaurant etiquette? AN APOLOGY. Nobody apologized for the fruit flies. They just kind of went ""oh..."" and went on their way. I can't even review the food because the fruit flies swarmed the dishes before we could fully enjoy it.  Good thing I had a gift card and didn't spend actual money. Needless to say, I will NOT be coming back to this location. EDIT  Contacted corporate (as a friend recommended), and they pretty much said ""Sorry you had a bad time, did you talk to the manager?

They have such a wide variety of dishes on their menu from pastas to burgers and pizza. I love the complementary bread they give you before your meal. I always end up asking for seconds. I ordered their Shepard's pie last time, it was absolutely delicious. It's so awesome that an American restaurant known for their cheesecakes would have a traditional English dish, and know how to cook it so well! It's basically mashed potatoes with cheese on top of a mixture of minced beef with veggies. Sounds simple, but the flavors were so complex and perfectly blends in your mouth for the perfect bite! To top off my meal, I ordered a strawberry cheesecake. My only negative critic is that the menu says ""fresh strawberries"", but that isn't true. The strawberries are preserved in their strawberry sauce and put on top of the original cheesecake, but it still tasted very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=180

Called to make a reservation, some guy took all my information down, walked in Monday night and the girl up front pretends to look for a reservation @ 7 (even though she knew they don't take reservations) after she's done pretending, she tells me, they don't take reservations. I start arguing with her because she told me, ""well everyone working here knows we don't take reservations after a certain time."" OBVIOUSLY NOT, dummy!! Another employee steps in and tells me that she can seat us in about 20 minutes on the patio. I walk back, to inform them that there will be one less person in my party. After hearing it would be 20 minutes, the stupid girl I talked to in the beginning told me, oh, well now it's going to be 45 minutes because of one less person! WTF?! I asked How is that possible for the wait time to double with one less person?! Stupid! She asked for my name and I gave it to her, and then she goes ""oh! Your THAT family....""

Pyt L.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,,2.0,2/28/2017,"-Came here on a Saturday night for a birthday celebration, it was way too crowded, we waited for a WHOLE HOUR until we were called, and even when my party was called, we were called to stand around for 5 more minutes rather than being seated right away as there was another line for the parties that were called, which was fine with me but it was definitely not ideal for my grandma with her walker - this would be a 1 to 2 stars wait/operation. -The pina colada was pretty good, and the food all came out to be average (so food and beverage alone would've deserved a 3 stars.) It's not bad thought, just nothing was amazingly delicious.  -Server did an okay job, nothing to be complained about on top of my head except that she brought over some plates one time, and 2 of them were kind of dirty. Also, we've mentioned that the occasion to eat there was for my birthday celebration, and after looking up some posts on yelp & google, it appeared that Cheesecake Factory gives complementary dessert/ or sundae for birthday celebrations. However, all I'd gotten for my special day was 2 blobs of decorated free whip cream with a happy birthday message along with the piece of cheesecake that I paid for. -The mango cheesecake was really kind of below average too, and a bit too sweet..I've definitely tasted better cheesecake else where, so this was disappointing. (perhaps I should try other flavors next time) To be fair, I was a bit ticked off because all I'd received was the whip cream for my bday celebration after waiting for over an hour, so this review definitely took into consideration of that. Perhaps it's not by industry standard that every restaurant is expected to give a little something nice on an actual birthday celebration, but the experience there really just made me feel exceptionally ""unspecial"" dining there on my birthday when I could've gone else where.  Moral of the review - probably go somewhere else if you want to feel special on your birthday. (but it's a bit shocking to know Cheesecake factory can't afford to give an extra scoop of ice cream for birthday customers) (the pina colada was really good though! - maybe coming here for happy hour would be a better idea..I would appreciate 1 extra cherry to be in my cup if I'm there for a celebration - at least it has some nutritional value)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=180

One thing that keeps us coming back to Cheesecake Factory is the complimentary bread (perfect blends of grain in each type - unlike anything I've tasted before) and the large variety of specialty dishes. The decor is very nice, and the restaurant is clean and very hospitable. Another is that the waiters and waitresses are attentive, and will go the extra mile to ensure that we enjoy our meal/dessert. During one of our visits, we asked our waitress if she could put a slice of cheesecake in the freezer for us because we wanted the cheesecake frozen/more solid, and she happily put a slice in the freezer for us. I know it can be an inconvenience when a customer asks for something unusual, but I really appreciated this waitress going above and beyond. They also serve large sharing portions, especially for the pastas, and are decently priced for the amount of food that you get.

Both times they said ""it will be ready in 20 minutes,"" so I get there in 25 minutes. The 2nd time I ordered was with a ""Cory"" who happened to be the manager (I knew this because I called to complain about what happened below) 1. I call curbside and asked for the name on the order and they mentioned someone will be right out. I had to wait 10+ minutes.  2. The girl that came out didn't even acknowledge or apologize for how long it tools come out. She takes my card and comes back.. With NO FOOD after another 10 minutes. But mentions it will be ""right out."" Keep in mind this is past the 25 minutes past the 25 minutes from the initial promised time. 3. Finally the food comes out.  ... So, back to the time I placed the order.. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta WITHOUT mushrooms and extra sauce on the side buffalo blasts with RANCH, and the Cuban rolls. Cory also asked if I wanted complimentary bread. I said ""yes please."" Who then repeated the exact order. He got it right.  When the girl brings my food out she repeats my order and asked if I wanted bread??? At this point I was so irritated and just said no thanks and left to go home. I live a good 10 minutes from this location. So, I open the bag.. The pasta had mushrooms (the wife's allergic to it) and no extra sauce.. The blasts had blue cheese and I hate blue cheese.. NO Ranch. This literally happened twice, the same exact way. I called to notify them of their poor service and was transferred to Cory. I told him what happened and he said he checked the order himself.. ""Did you?"" Just a little bit of advice, don't over promise and under deliver. Don't say 25 minutes, when it's really an hour.

Juvi G.,"Pomona, CA",432,597,4354,5.0,12/16/2013,"This is one ritzy place. And now I know they sell way more than cheesecake. In fact, the other options on their menu, (that which can be characterized as ""real food"") is probably better than the desserts.  Just about everything here is delicious, as far as I know. What I love is the sheer variety they offer. Yes, even healthy options for those of us who need to still fit into our skinny jeans the following day. It all boils down to your preferences. I always prefer to visit restaurants like these with friends or family so that we can order different menu items that catch our eye, and share them. And although the price is right, it certainly doesn't hurt to share the bill.  Curious about some of the menu items? Well, here are some of the delicacies my family and I enjoyed: 1.) Crusted Pretzel Chicken: Crispy, juicy chicken strips on a skewer, made with crushed pretzel bits and served with 2 different sauces. 2.) Chicken & Mushroom Lettuce Wraps: Light and healthy Asian -style lettuce wraps with diced chicken & mushrooms, & dried noodle bits. (FYI: The lettuce is romaine lettuce, so the chicken, mushrooms, & noodle bits are hard to grab). 3.) Parmesan Polenta Fries- Mild & creamy polenta cheese sticks, topped with parmesan cheese, and served with a side of marinara sauce. Don't expect the cheesy mozzarella sticks you find at other restaurants. This is more of a soft, creamy cheese.  4.) Avocado, Mushroom, & Zucchini Fries- Amazingly savory pieces of fried veggies served with 2 different sauces. My favorite are the mushrooms. Those are some juicy little bites of fried heaven. Veggie or not, though, I wouldn't count them as healthy. Even the endless portions of free bread they bring to your table are amazing. My favorite is that black, whole grain bread with oats. I used to think it was burnt beyond recognition, but it turns out to be soft, chewy, and subtly sweet. Try it with a bit of honey that they bring to your table. It's really good. I'm not much of an alcohol drinker, but even the booze looks & sounds great, here. They have almost every cocktail, martini, & beer you can imagine. The service is usually friendly, and as for the price: 4 of us ate to our hearts' content for a little over $46. You can't beat that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=260

Dim lighting, single candle in the middle of your table for two, and even though it was loud everywhere, I was still able to focus on my handsome date.  We ordered the avocado egg roll as an appetizer, we weren't interested. It was kind of bland and the sauce didn't make it any better. I did like the stuff that came around it, looked like styrofoam, but tasted like air, it was interesting.  We both had the combo, salmon with Dianne steak. Fell in love with the salmon immediately! I'm glad I had it first because the steak is more heavy; along with the mashed potatoes. I couldn't finish everything because I just ate too much and there wasn't much left, so I decided to not box the rest.  We ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake. I honestly didn't think it was going to be a chocolate overload, but if you don't think that there's no such thing as ""too sweet"" or ""too chocolatey,"" then this is your cheesecake! But for my boyfriend and I, we won't be getting that one again...our fault.  Overall, I liked that we didn't wait long. The food was good, as well as the service.

Joey D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",155,453,213,2.0,7/13/2014,"Lacks consistency  I've been here so many times and I still can't tell if I like this particular location.  I've had some great experiences and some pretty terrible experiences.  My last visit was not my favorite. This last visit was a Friday night at 8pm.  It was shockingly more crowded than I thought it would be at 8pm- it was pretty packed and held a steady 45min wait. Long wait is fine, but  throughout dinner it was clear that they were understaffed and it made it a fairly unpleasant time. Aside from the regular taking orders and delivering food, we didn't see our waiter much at all.  I'm sure he was busy, but it just wasn't with us- the staff was stretched pretty thin.  Refills and additional requests were very hard to come by.  My order came out wrong- not the waiters fault, the cook added random stuff to my burger that it doesn't come with and I needed it remade.  Normally that's a pain, but even more so that night because of the sparse staffing.  I finally got it taken back, but now other people you are eating with feel compelled to wait.  That's always annoying especially when it's a careless mistake. When the burger came back it was made correctly and the food was legitimately delicious.  That's why we keep coming back- the food rarely disappoints.  It's just everything else that's iffy.  If they could handle staffing better, it would make a better experience for the guest.  Everyone seemed to be waiting a long time for simple requests and the neighboring table chatter indicated everyone was as put off as we were. The bottom line- if you come here during a busy time, be prepared for long waits and have patience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=260

We also loved the Crispy Artichoke Hearts from the small plates menu - 9 for $3.95. They may have been marinated, but they were still good. For my entree - the best of both worlds .... Shrimp AND Bacon Club Sandwich. The bread was wonderfully buttery and if I wasn't totally full from all the appetizers, I could have finished it!

I got the lunch combo but the sandwich was very plain (even though I had to send it back 3 times because they kept putting mayo on it; props to the waiter, Ben i think, for being very apologetic and nice), they could have made it their own with some kind of sauce or different topping than tomato and cheese....the salad didn't even have carrots or cucumbers, JUST red lettuce and dressing.  For a place whose had such a bad health wrap, I'll give them a star for creating a healthy menu under 500 calories, but the ahi tartare left much to be desired with only ahi, avocado and a little sauce (which was good in its own right) but could have had more than 4 chips and/or add cucumbers or onions or SOMEthing.

Lawrence L.,"Covina, CA",515,1037,7335,4.0,11/18/2010,"Spent a nice time celebrating a birthday with some dear friends at the Brea Mall edition of the CF.  Aside from the great company, the experience at this chain restaurant is so typical of most of the locations that I have been to... not that it's a bad thing, there just isn't much to write about that is new... Obviously known for their wide selection of cheesecakes (well... DUH!), you can find almost anything on their menu that is high calorie, high carb comfort food... On this occasion, I did something that I usually don't do -- I ordered the Rib Eye Steak;  I guess I was in the mood for some beef.  It was decently sized, well marbled, boneless cut;  even though I usually go for the bone-in cuts because I feel that they have more flavor.  Grilled with the requisite cross-hatches on both sides medium rare, you could do worse for a steak for $29.95 all things considered. I also had the soup du jour, the Creamy Chicken Noodle soup;  meh... it was ok but I've had better soup du jours from the CF in the past. The most memorable part of my meal was the refreshing red Sangria in a wine glass with fresh fruit on the rocks, smooth.  The other half of the most memorable part was the slice of Italian Tiramisu cheesecake, close to another 1000 calories, but what the hell, it was delish. From my vantage point, a good time was had by all in our party,  so I can't complain too much about anything.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  The place was busy all night but we were seated without too much of a wait at 500pm on a Saturday.  Since we had a party of eight, the bill was padded with an 18% discretionary gratuity but this wasn't unusual... so with tax and tip, with drinks and appetizers too, it came out to around $40 a head... not too shabby...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=420

We have been to this Brea location twice this year for dinner.  Parking has not been a problem.  I do not believe they currently have valet parking.  We have not had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table which is great!  At other locations, the wait is normally 30 minutes or longer for dinner.  The service was terrific during our first visit.  The last visit, the service was not as good.  During that last visit, I believe our server was new so I'll give her a pass for taking so long with taking our orders and helping us.  That is the reason that I'm not giving them 5 stars though. The food is delicious, and they give generous portions.  We always have leftovers good for one or two meals afterwards.  The entree prices are pricey, but the portions help make up for it.  There are many different choices on the menu so you are sure to find something you like.  I have not found anything bad yet. Make sure to save room for dessert!!  That's the reason I always have leftovers is because I save room for the cheesecake!!  Going to Costco and buying their cheesecake at the frozen section is just not nearly as good as getting the cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory itself.  My current favorites are the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake, the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake, Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, and the Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake.  I just wish they weren't so expensive!! If you just want to buy a slice of cheesecake, then you can buy it at the front when you walk into the restaurant.  They have a counter and display there.  The display showcases many of their cheesecakes and other desserts.  The display of cheesecakes is the most beautiful attraction in the restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=420

I have visited this location two times and both times it happened to be during a busy lunch hour slot. Both within the last two months.  I have ordered the same thing every time I go to because it's always great; lunch salmon with all broccoli. Our waters with lemon came out without lemon, had to wait five minutes to see our waitress again to ask for the lemon and then waited another five minutes after that for her to realize we never got our bread basket. We tried to order when she brought us the basket but before I got a word out she was off to another table.  We waited another seven minutes to have her back at our table to take our order.  Food came out promptly and we ate pretty quick because it's always good food. But once again when we were totally finished eating we were sitting there for an extended period of time with no refills or our bill. So when we saw the waitress again we asked for a manager.  This was the kicker. The manager told us she had a few trainees on the wait staff at the moment. I don't know any restaurant management that trains newbies during their busiest time slot. It just doesn't happen for this exact reason. She went to take a percentage off our bill but the waitress had already run our card so later I found out I was double charged by them.

Indy P.,"Fullerton, CA",0,58,,1.0,8/29/2016,"Hubby took me here for my birthday. Quoted a wait time of 15 minutes (we waited 25, which was not great but OK). It took 35-40 minutes to get our food (which was unacceptable). While everyone else around us (who came in much later was already halfway through their meals), we were fighting over the bread. Our waitress (Alejandra) passed our table many times but actually stopped only once to refill our bread because we were obviously starving and had devoured everything in sight that was edible. We had to flag her down after 25 minutes to ask about the food. Only then did it seem to occur to her that we had been waiting a LONG time. She brought out my entree -- Tuscan chicken -- and it was COLD, which indicates to me that the meal had been sitting there for a while waiting to be picked up by her. She told hubby that his dish was going to take longer (he didn't order anything fancy -- beef steak tacos!). We start eating MY meal together and he finally gets his tacos about 5 minutes later -- and it, too, was COLD. Aside from the temperature of the food, neither of us were impressed with the TASTE of our selections either.  Mine was supposed to be ""served over vegetables and farro."" The picture depicted showed a generous heap of farro but I could actually COUNT each grain on my plate. There was no more than a teaspoon! It was my first time ordering this so maybe that's the norm but it certainly did not look like the picture they had.  Hubby is NOT a picky eater AT ALL, but even he was underwhelmed w/ the beef tacos. Overall, a horrible experience. Oh, I had to use a butter knife on my chicken because I asked (twice) for a knife to cut my meat and after waiting 10 minutes, they brought out a knife that WAS DIRTY. The second knife they brought out (I was almost done with the meal by now), was cleaner. The only reason we came was for the cheesecakes which I love. But at $8.59 for a slice of mango key lime cheesecake, I expected a lot more than the thin wimpy stingy sliver that I got -- the 2 heaps of whipped cream (which I don't even like) covered up the cheap portion and we did not realize this until we got home. I couldn't believe it. What a rip off! Further, hubby told our waitress we were celebrating my birthday. She never once said happy birthday, nor did she offer the birthday sundae that many tables around us got.This is possibly the worse restaurant experience I've encountered this year so far -- from the wait time to the despicable portions to the clueless wait staff.

I haven't been to cheesecake factory for years.. probably over ten years. I began to crave it again after seeing a Cheesecake factory box over at Dean's Curry Pizza in Long Beach. I was also craving burger so opted to come here.  I ordered the factory burger with Swiss cheese prepared medium-well. It came on a baguette. I figured this was a bakery so the baguette would be good. It wasn't. Hard as a rock. I even took one side off like an open sandwich and it was useless. Still, hard as heck.  ~Factory Burger- 1 Star  This burger sucked, primarily because of that bread. On the same note..the meat was very dry. Hard to explain. It wasn't juicy at all. What good is meat if it's not juicy meat? Don't get your meat where you get your bread... I should have stuck to the regular hamburger bun. How could a burger that looked so yummy..be so uneatable!  In all honesty, I ate almost half of the burger. I brought the other half back and just gave it to the dog. What a waste. I noticed that my dog didn't eat the baguette either..just the meat. However, this is no fault of Cheesecake factory, as she never eats bread. I just thought it was funny this time.  ~Red Velvet Cheesecake~4.5 stars!  They did a good job with this bad boy.. Yummy and well prepared. Absolutely Delicious. I would order this again, but will do so in another ten years. My bad burger ruined my night.

Just a few of my favorite cheesecake are: White Chocolate Raspberry (of course), Fresh Banana cream cheesecake, Chocolate Tuxedo cream, Oreo cheesecake, and Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Yumm.... They really are the only place to get such amazingly unique, rich, and amazing cheesecakes. As for their food, I really like the Cheesecake factory in Arcadia. I was disappointed by the food in the one in Westwood. As for this one, it's pretty good. I like to stick to the stuff I know they are good at, which is the Chicken Madeira and mushroom (their most popular dish, the one they sell most of), Crusted Chicken Romano, and Crispy Chicken Costoletta. For some reason all their specialite dishes are all chicken. So I guess if you're in the mood for chicken and cheesecake this is the place to go. I also had many of their salads and pastas.

They are infamous for their GINORMOUS portions---but for someone who loves leftovers, I'm definitely a fan. (Granted, what I bring usually lasts me at least 2 more meals!) But if you come for lunch, many entrees come in half sizes. And yes, those are still on the larger side. Sure the wait for any Cheesecake Factory can be ridiculous but we usually call in orders for take out. And with the curbside feature, you don't even have to get out of your car to deal with their crowded lobbies!

Mateo C.,"Whittier, CA",15,28,8,3.0,9/29/2015,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory for my birthday with my family. We were a total of four people. This location is always a zoo. There are so many people here that it's hard to actually relax. The hosts need a better plan to organize the chaos of waiting for a table. The hostess who took my name offered us a seat outside because the wait was shorter. I figured it was a nice day so I agreed to that plan. Five minutes later she ""whispered"" my name to alert me to my table being ready. If I hadn't been standing next to the host desk I would have missed my table. We were escorted out to the table and sat down. The first thing we noticed was that the four appetizer plates were FILTHY. It was like they hadn't been washed at all. We quickly asked for new plates. None came. We finally went to another table, looked at the plates there to see if they were clean and grabbed them ourselves. After 15 minutes waiting, the busboy came with new plates and was embarrassed to find we had handled problem number one ourselves. He left. Our server came to the table and introduced himself. He was a fairly nice guy but he was on the quiet side. He took our drink orders and then gave us a few moments to decide what we wanted to order. When he brought our drinks out some minutes later, he asked if he wanted bread at our table. I would think this should be a given. We waited a few more minutes for bread to come and we reviewed our menu to order. Again the server was kind enough. Not Mr. Personality but kind. He took our orders and we waited for our food. The food was average. I had mentioned that I was celebrating a birthday but no birthday recognition was given. I don't expect a hundred dollar bar tab but a free piece of cheesecake or plate of appetizers or cocktail would have been appreciated. I generally like Cheesecake Factory as a rule but I couldn't help but feel disappointed this time.

Pauls Place's Mushroom Burger ($5) is WAY better than what they feel the need to charge $12.95 for. I REALLY don't think an 8oz glass of Apple Martini is worth $11. You can take the little lemon swirl out and knock the drink down to $4 and we would be in business because that is about what it is worth. Trying to get the check was next to impossible.

While my glass still sits empty I devise a quick plan to ensure I don't interfere with the flow of this bar:  Me, money, and willingness to part with some cash, perform a magic trick that should surprise no one:  I paid for my beer (with tip) and left leaving behind others still sitting with empty glasses.  Before heading home, hunger and money still in tow, I spent some money at another local chain being served by a bartender that interacted and smiled and brought food and beverage.

She was not attentive and barely came to our table. didn't really understand.... because she would go around to the surrounding tables except ours. Also, we asked for NEW coffee....what is the point of asking for NEW coffee??... if you're just going to pour the NEW coffee into the COLD OLD coffee...Also, I wish they would change their server uniforms to black or a darker color. The food and drink stains all over servers clothing...umm not very presentable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=740
Ralph O.,"Chino Hills, CA",253,620,67,4.0,1/20/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those tried and true places.  The place was packed and we ended sitting at the bar. I got the turkey burger with a side salad to try and eat healthier.  It was very good, didn't really notice it wasn't beef.  Then I ended up sharing a sundae with the wife, I did say I was trying to eat healthy didn't say I was actually succeeding!  The vanilla ice cream was good but the fudge was room temperature not hot.  The service was friendly and fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=740
Karney V.,"Studio City, CA",98,309,2,4.0,7/8/2010,"I always order the same thing at certain places I go so I cannot really comment on what else to suggest in terms of main courses. Their chicken madeira is great, and I am one with the belief that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Cheesecakes are pretty good, too, as they don't skimp on ingredients like other places. Reservations are good if you can get one.  Wait time here is always at least 10-15 if you simply walk in, as it is one of the very few decent places in this area that caters to students/faculty from the surrounding high school, colleges, optometry, and law school in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=740
Ryan M.,"Emeryville, CA",783,912,135,3.0,9/8/2009,"This is like what, the fourth Cheesecake Factory I've gone and reviewed? Like all other Cheesecake Factory, this location holds consistent to the rest of its brethren. For a particular reason to review this spot, I took a glimpse at the mighty hype that's plaguing the dessert world at the moment...Red Velvet. For this particular visit, it was to finally put to the test of Feeding America's (a charity to feed the poor of course), recipe on Stephanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. Now after trying so many desserts, I think I have a good hold as to what to look for. Some may consider a nice dessert to be a well balanced delicacy. Perfect in texture, fluff, sweetness, and gluttony all around. For others, the idea of having a Sugar Rush the size of 100 Kindergarteners bum rushing you for Birthday Cake may be another way of perceiving the perfect treat. This item I might add was a whopping 1556 calories, an unprecedented amount compared to the rest of their cheescake offerings. If that doesn't tickle your jelly rolls, the idea of whipped cream, dazzled in White Chocolate Shavings a la Mousse', and a bi-layer of red velvet seduction all in one bite. You gotta hand it to Steph, she developed one enticing edible that made me give it to her, for a one night stand. The price of such whore-riffic antics, $7.50 ($0.25, goes to charity; should be a lot more in my opinion); with $50.00 for an entire cheesecake. Unfortunately, I wasn't up for an inflation so I bought a slice. It certainly lived up to the medium of all dessert fans. Sweet enough with the red velvet and white chocolate in harmony, nothing wasn't really overpowering one element over another. However I love my sugar, so the lack of it made me a bit jaded. So why not a perfect rating? Two things, price (could be justified, if they donated more of it to the charity) and the fact that my birthday friend had to consume it while, I was in wheelchair status (P90x/Bboying made me lose a lot of my alcoholic absorption powers aka fat) the night I was suppose to consume it all to myself. Overall, not too bad it'll be a while unless someone wants to buy me a whole cheesecake or another slice of this stuff to make me beg for their attention. Sorry cashier girl, not enough convincing on your part.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=740
Toni L.,"Los Angeles, CA",907,873,3488,2.0,9/17/2007,"I can say pretty much the same thing about every Cheesecake Factory in the chain, so I will. 1) Long wait w/ no possibility for a reservation 2) BAD service 3) Fattening food that tastes awesome while you're in the restaurant but might give you indigestion after a few hours pass 4) Leftovers galore 5) Half cheesy (HAHAHA) half art nouveau decor which works in my opinion but I can see how it might not for everyone Some notes about this particular location: OMFG. If you thought service was slow at CF, then this will redefine your idea of slowosity. We had to wait nearly 15 minutes to get BREAD (and they didn't even give us honey oat when it finally came!!!). No wonder there's a ginormous line outside!! I'd seriously avoid going to this location if you have other options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=740
Kay D.,"Orange, CA",376,708,719,3.0,9/14/2009,"I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and would normally give the franchise 4 stars.  This location is relatively new, and extremely packed (too packed), so they get knocked down a star. What I love about Cheesecake Factory is that they give you ENORMOUS PORTIONS of whatever you order, so I normally get 2 meals of leftovers after I leave.  Oh, and I guess they have good cheesecake here, too. My favorite entrees here are the pasta dishes.  The Thai chicken linguini is amazing!  It doesn't really taste like a Thai dish, but that doesn't stop the peanut sauce Heaven from dancing in my tummy. Sometimes I come here just for the cheesecake.  I'm not a big chocolate fan (though they have more than enough rich chocolatey goodness to satisfy any chocolate lover), and my personal favorite is the raspberry lemon cheesecake.  I also love the vanilla bean or the dulce de leche, which are so simple but amazing! As a bonus, they also make a mighty good mojito! I would never choose/suggest to come here, but I wouldn't say no if somebody else wanted to bring me.  :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=740
Diana L.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,111,,3.0,10/26/2009,"Service is whatevers. Sometimes you get lucky with a really good waiter. Other than that, you get stuck with high school/college kids who seem to be too busy for you. The food is decent. It's okay for the price I guess. The only realllyyy good things are the brown bread (they give you one amidst all the white sourdough/french bread, so you have to keep asking for baskets of bread). And the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It's A LOT of calories, and technically you only need one bite because it's so savory, but that one bite is heaven!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=740

S R B.,"La Habra, CA",0,14,,4.0,4/3/2013,"We arrived about 6 p.m. on a Friday evening. The greeter said it would be about 10 minutes for an outside table. I like to eat outside. It is quieter too. The buzzer rang only 10 seconds later. As usual, fast service and good food. We had a table on the outside patio by the railing.  A male and female ducks came over to say hello. The ducks were friendly and caught bread pieces we tossed to them in the air. My friend said she had seen the ducks elsewhere in Brea, and they travel around together. I get gift certificates as presents, and sometimes forget I have them, or don't get around to using them. I had a Cheesecake Factory gift certificate from 1998. It was a paper one. I wasn't sure if they would take it. They did. Good for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=740
Daniela M.,"Pasadena, CA",69,108,8,2.0,5/5/2011,"Ok right off the bat, my qualm with CF is that they charge so much for mediocre food.   I do have to admit however that they have a delicious pomegranate margarita.  There's an extra star just for that bad boy. Anyway, we accidentally busted a ""Oh yeah that' us"" and got seated right away.  We heard ""party of 3"" and I said ""yup that's us"" only to hear my cousin say after we were seated ""did she say party of 3? or party for christine?""  Christine- if you're reading this- whoever you are...my bad. So the service was aiight and  the atmosphere was nice the food tasted like hamburger helper.  Nuff said.  I found it ridiculous that they had ads on the menu.  I mean come on, now we can't even eat without having companies bombarding us with advertisements?   Don't think I'd come back unless someone specifically requests to come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-brea?start=740

""Sure, that sounds good"" Once I've spent a couple hours reading their book...uh menu... the gluttony begins! Seriously the  portions    are HUGE!
