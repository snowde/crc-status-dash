Caryn P.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",3,25,23,5.0,1/5/2018,Great food and cheesecake!  But long line on Friday night and won't take reservations after 5 pm. We waited an hour. My fried shrimp was delicious.  Good atmosphere but music too loud to enjoy conversation!  Sara was an excellent waiter and gave us wonderful service and was willing to split the bill into three checks!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park
Che B.,"West Hills, CA",2,77,17,1.0,12/30/2017,"This 1 star is specifically for your bar tender working at 3:45 on Saturday the 30th. Dark hair- all I can say is she was so rude I wanted to fire her myself. Horrible service, doesn't smile! I asked for a water to go and she gave me the dirtiest look and then handed it to me with her fingers all over my straw and didn't say your welcome or anything! There are a ton of people who need jobs fire her and hire Someone who will treat your customers right!  She has terrible customer service and honestly ruined my experience.

Nadia G.,"San Diego, CA",4222,335,211,5.0,12/21/2017,I have been to many Cheesecake Factories in different states and especially all over California over the years. This is by far the best experience I have had at a Cheesecake Factory. They excel at customer service compared to the others.  We were seated quickly which never happens and our waitress was excellent. She was on top of it when we needed drink refills and she was attentive without being intrusive. The food was good - the usual of what you get at any Cheesecake Factory.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park
Nikki K.,"Los Angeles, CA",998,100,225,3.0,12/5/2017,"I'm torn between giving this location a two or three star review. I understand that all Cheesecake Factory's are extremely busy, especially on the weekends, but that should not compromise the service of the staff. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by two hosts backs turned towards us. One of the girls turned around, looked directly at us and continued her non-work related conversation with her co worker. When she finally had the time to do her job, she ""welcomed"" us by curtly asking, ""how many?"" I asked her how long the wait would be for a party of 2, and she let out a sigh looked around and said maybe 10 minutes. I put our name down and we waited on the side of the host's stand.  I was extremely upset with the host's attitude and lack of customer service skills. I understand that everyone has bad days or that you may not like your job, but it's very obvious when there is absolutely no effort being put into your job. We were very fortunate to have a very polite and friendly server named Daryl. He instantly changed my mood when he greeted us with warm fresh bread and promptly took our orders. The food was delicious and Daryl went above and beyond to turn our dining experience around.  If you dine in at this Cheesecake Factory's location, beware of the rude service from the hosts!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park
Evelina C.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",388,401,369,3.0,11/1/2017,"Always super busy and the service is not always the best. It can be really hard to find a table during busy hours so if you are celebrating - definitely reserve a table. Happy hour windows are super slight and the menu is not great at all. To be honest not worth it for food. The happy hour portions are two pieces. One for him one for her.  Our favorite is the habachi steak, my hubby loves it and introduced me- rare with Wasabi mashed potatoes. DELICIOUS.  Our server was cool. But not very attentive and efficient.  Wish I didn't have to ask for my water to be filled- time in and time out. But other than that, sure we'll eat here on occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park
Miss B.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,55,45,3.0,1/12/2018,Usually go to the Grove or Glendale Cheesecake Factory but my boss took us to this one. It was okay but I asked for a egg white omelette and they brought it with yolk. The fruit was meh. My coworker ordered salmon which looked pretty good. I always get the Ahi Salad or skinnylicious Lemon shrimp and am never disappointed. Think I'll stick to those menu items.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park
Kimberly H.,"Los Angeles, CA",583,103,162,4.0,12/24/2017,Came here Saturday before Christmas for brunch. It was busy but only had to wait 10 min for a table. Always love the complimentary warm bread they bring out. I opted for breakfast spinach egg benedict & my husband got burger & fries. They had messed up on my order at first but my waiter was quick to let me know that the server picked up the wrong plate. My husbands fries were cold when they brought out his food. We didn't get any cheesecake this time but my favorite is the Oreo!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park
Tally S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,40,16,4.0,1/9/2018,I love Cheesecake Factory but the chicken piccata was not my favorite dish.

Aaron F.,"Mesa, AZ",240,101,101,5.0,1/3/2018,"What can you say about the world famous cheesecake factory. Be careful ordering as the serving sizes are generous. If you eat too much, you won't have room for that desert you deserve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park
Jenny R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",160,81,108,4.0,12/29/2017,"I go to this Cheesecake Factory a lot mainly because of its convenient location.

Lola W.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,62,17,4.0,11/23/2017,"Stopped by for a quick lunch Friday afternoon and was able to be seated right away. This Cheesecake Factory is located on the outside of the mall with entrance from the parking lot. I always find it odd that parking is a little tricky for this location given it's located by the parking lot.  This location seems clean and well kept. The servers were really nice and offered to take our drink order right away. Bread and butter was brought to the table promptly. Once we placed our orders, we didn't wait long for our food. My all-time favorite items at Cheesecake are avocado egg rolls and buffalo wings. While the menu offers much yummier items, for me, those two are favoriteeee. Which means I order them at each location and judge each location how well they can prepare those items. Oddly enough, yes they do vary in flavor, freshness, etc. The avocado egg rolls were amazing, super fresh. Fresh avocado and really well made. Chicken wings were good too, I personally think they were better/crispier at The Grove location.  Another items I tried this particular day was chicken madeira, which is their most popular item, or so it says so on their menu. Anyway, it was really good. Chicken was juicy and not dry at all, super filling too.  Overall one of the better locations for Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park

Leslie A.,"Canoga Park, CA",40,152,183,2.0,11/29/2017,"First time coming to The Cheesecake Factory since they made the move over from the Warner Center.  *Deep Sigh* What happened guys? Like... what were you guys thinking? When The Cheesecake Factory was located in Warner Center it was worth going to. It felt fancy AF in there. It was clean, the outside seating was beautiful, & it stood on it's own. It was FUN to go out & have a date night. Now... it sucks. It's located on probably the worst side of the mall by the old Sears. ""Outside"" seating is just a joke. You get either: a beautiful view of the Valet Parking lot, so you can watch the snobs too lazy to find parking on their own pay $15. Or you can choose plan B of their outdoor seating by having a beautiful view of the MALL. & by view of the mall, I mean all you see is an old Sears, Wetzels Pretzels, & Forever 21. WTF? Again, what was the thought process here? While I'm sure sales are up because of the foot traffic, the quality has gone doooown. This place is Sizzler quality now. Sucks.

Annie W.,"Anaheim, CA",680,75,458,5.0,11/14/2017,"It's Cheesecake Factory, so of course it's good! The funny thing is every time I come here, I'm so full from their delicious food, that I don't get dessert! Awesome place to come from happy hour! 4-6pm in the bar area only! (Tip: The low two top tables in the bar are seat yourself until 6pm) They have a bunch of great appetizers that are around $5 and few cocktails and draft beers also on special! Some of our favorite appetizers to get are: Avocado Egg Rolls Potstickers  Sliders We also love to split the Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic (it's more calories than one person should probably consume at once) and then get a few small plates to share!  Right now we love the taquitos & Nashville Hot Nuggets! Perfect spot for date night, outing with friends, or happy hour!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park

It's not the location or the service, it's the food. I have tried different things each time I've gone and I've found the food to be very bland and boring. The cheesecake is also mediocre at best. This place is way overrated and overpriced.  I don't mind waiting for a table or paying more if the food is good but this place is so not worth my time or money.

Matias P.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",26,52,118,3.0,11/10/2017,I've come to Cheesecake Factory a handful of times and this place is always PACKED! Not sure why you can't make reservations ahead of time at such a nice looking spot. Their food is ok. Not many WOW factor dishes. Their service is also ok.  Takes way too long to get your food.

Cheri N.,"West Hills, CA",24,197,1647,5.0,7/23/2017,"We love Cheesecake Factory on Topanga.  Friday night we were celebrating my daughter's 11th birthday.  We were an intimate party of six, walked in at 6pm and were immediately seated.  Wow!   This is the second time at this location where we had no wait but it seemed busy.   I love that! The food as usual was great.   Ordered a new item called chicken Parmesan ""pizza style"" and it was delish.  I also love their basic tossed salad with blue cheese dressing.  Their dressings are flavorful, thick, and rich.  The best dressing here is the blue cheese with thick chunks of blue cheese all through out. On the down side: The artichokes appetizer went up in price to $11.95 for one and a half artichokes and last night it was undercooked, tough, and over charred.   The mayo dressing dip was ok but I liked the balsamic that they used to serve with a tender fire toasted choke.    Also, the sourdough bread was tough, it seemed day old and a bit stale.  Boo! On the up side: Loved the cheesecake and other deserts; they made my girl's birthday special with a decorated desert plate, candle, and song.  Sweet! Although the parking is vast at this location, it can be a nightmare to walk through the mall parking lot since there are a lot of zig zag rows and many drivers moving about.    They also offer valet if you'd rather just avoid the stupid parking lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park
Monica M.,"Sylmar, CA",64,88,304,4.0,10/8/2017,"Best thing to do on a busy Saturday night is send someone from your party to reserve a table while you continue to shop, you'll get a txt when your table is up next.  About 45 minutes later we got a txt and heard over to CF. We all ordered lemonades, I had the cucumber lemonade and it's a little to sweet but nothing some water mixed in can't help.

Esther C.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,8,2,4.0,11/29/2017,Ate here for my birthday with my parents and boyfriend. As usual they were packed so service (although they were very nice) was lacking. It was hard to flag down our waiter.  However the dishes I tried were fantastic. We ordered two dishes off of their specialties menu (new dishes that they are testing the waters with). I forget the exact name but it had Asian influences and contained chicken and pineapples. I didn't fall in love with it but my boyfriend raved about it afterwards for a long time. Next we ordered the carne asada medallions. Delicious! Absolutely recommend it for the next time you go. Lastly we ordered the fresh strawberry cheesecake. No complaints there.

I had the Fish Tacos once.   No bueno.  Everything else has been consistently good.  Service is always good.  Nice restaurant inside.  One of my favorite places (to get fat). I wanted Fish and Chips but I also wanted some Fried Shrimp.  Fat guy craving fried food, imagine that.  They don't offer a combo of these two.  They really should, people would go nuts.  So, the Queen of Reseda's #2 daughter and I split the two dishes.  It was perfect. Here's a hot tip for you.  I asked the waiter how many pieces of fish you get with the lunch portion apposed to the regular order.  There's about a $3.00 or $4.00 difference between the two.  He said they both come with the same (4) pieces of fish.  The regular order just comes with more fries!  I never eat all the fries anyway, who does?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=20

Michael T.,"Tarzana, CA",307,174,25,5.0,9/5/2017,"I had a hard time giving a chain restaurant like The Cheesecake Factory 5 stars... but I try to give fair grades based on expectations and on what they are.  While this isn't ""as good as it gets"" compared to an amazing local restaurant with amazing ambience... when you go to a Cheesecake Factory, you have certain expectations of what you're getting... and for a Cheesecake Factory... this IS ""as good as it gets"", therefore... 5 stars. While the food and beverages are amazing and the menu is GIANT, a visit to The Cheesecake Factory isn't cheap... so it's not an everyday place to go for my family.  It has become a tradition for us to visit this location on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.  I look forward to it every year!  This location is nice and relaxing.  The wait staff is very nice.  In the past I've gotten a beer at the bar while my wife did some shopping, and it was very nice.  I highly recommend the spinach artichoke dip and the southwestern egg rolls for appetizers!   Despite the name and what they're famous for... we rarely get cheesecake because we opt for the appetizers over the dessert and are too full for dessert.

The wait is ridiculous at most hours of the day and night but we got lucky and on a Sunday evening and had a wait of about 30 minutes for a table for two.  I enjoyed a mac and cheese well done cheese burger.  It was unique and delicious. Our server informed us of some items that will be going off the menu the first week of February. Some of those items that I was able to remember are: hibiscus lemonade and fried avocado, zucchini and mushrooms.  Of course I had to go for a slice of cheesecake and I went with my favorite, banana creme cheesecake.

It was unacceptable and definitely upsetting that my pregnant sister had to wait over an hour for her food. The food wasn't even warm, food is mediocre and the cheesecakes are less than ok, you'll get a better cheesecake at Vons. This place is definitely not worth the money.

It's Monday through Friday 4 to 6 p.m. at this location. They have a wide variety of happy hour food items and lots of drink options as well. So far, we've tried the stuffed mushrooms, happy hour burger sliders, fries, Greek salad, and summer spring rolls. All are delicious. The soy dipping sauce for the summer rolls was really tasty and refreshing. The salad was fresh with a nice tangy dressing. The stuff mushrooms were really flavorful. The fries and the sliders were well cooked and nice. I also had the happy hour mojito. It's kind of light on alcohol, but for $5.75 it's a decent drink.  I guess the only down side is you can only do happy hours in the bar area with limited amount of tables, it usually fills up fast.

Then what really irked me was when one of the guys bussing the table behind us was hitting the bread crumbs off the seat with his towel and they went flying  right by us slightly hitting my son in the face. The manager came out to our table and apologized how their Kitchen should not be like this. Not only should the kitchen not be like this the people working here should not be like this as well.

I sat down and wanted to order happy hour at the main dining but got up to get my drink but the bar and they came over to stop me and said I cannot buy a drink if I'm sitting else where. Okay I'm sorry didn't know I was being that inconsiderate. The manager Justin is very quick to end the conversation not giving me good hospitality only reason why I'm here because my little brother wanted to eat here so bad and shop at the Topanga mall but this will be the last time I come here.

Cakes are way too rich and sugary.

There was 4 forks under the table I stepped on, and shredded cheese on the table and the menu. There is so many employees working here that I could hardly get back to my seat after my bathroom visit.... but they don't have one to ensure tables are clean?  2. The bathroom. There was literally s____t on the seat of the toilet. Like all over it! 3. They brought my sister the wrong food. Once they did bring her correct dinner (30 minutes later) we were all finished.  4.

She was very accommodating and very quick with our drinks and requests.  LOCATION-4 STARS It's in the mall and sort of outside of that makes sense. You can come eat and then walk off all the calories after.  AMBIANCE- 5 STARS  I  came during the week so it was fairly quiet and slow so I absolutely loved it.  FOOD- 4 STARS  You can never really go wrong at The Cheesecake Factory. The prices are low and the plates are huge!!!! I mean HUGE! Here's what we tried at this location.  EGGPLANT PARMESAN- 4 STARS: it comes with 4 eggplant patties deep fried with tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese melted on it. So filling and go good.

Aryo S.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",420,233,778,5.0,11/29/2016,"---Atmosphere, Service, Parking---- The Cheesecake Factory here now occupies the space where CPK once was; that's now located inside the mall somewhere. With the same look and feel of other locations elsewhere, it's a great setting. Something to make note is that the location has two patios here, one is situated outside, and another patio is inside the mall setting. The restaurant is located at the entrance of the mall where there is also a valet area structured between Neiman Marcus and the old Sears building.  I've found service to be generally pretty solid with a couple misses here and there. Expect it to be fairly busy at all times.  Located at the Westfield Topanga Mall parking is all around you, good luck! --Food, Drinks & Prices--- I'm sure you know what they provide here and at the many other locations; the menu is vast with all sorts of things. Many appetizers, small plates, pasta dishes, pizzas, burgers and sandwiches, soups and salads, tacos, chicken and steak dishes, seafood, and all other sorts of entrees, ranging and hitting many flavors of different cuisines. Portions are large and same with the calories in everything (don't look!).  Love the fresh bread and butter they serve first. I've pretty much loved everything I've had at the Factory over the years, can't go wrong with anything really.  Here's a few things I've tried: -Avocado Eggrolls - Avocado lovers unite! Tons of it obviously with a couple other ingredients mixed in served with a tamarind dipping sauce.  -Tex-Mex Eggrolls - Crispy rolls filled w/spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions and melted cheese. Served with avocado cream and a pica de gallo.  -Buffalo Bites - Lots of breading on this thing but for those who love buffalo sauce these are filled with chicken, cheese and wing sauce.  -Crab Cakes - Three of them I believe and pretty tasty.  -Meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread - Great meatballs and sauce, served with great bread for dipping -Chicken Scampi Pasta - All the great flavors of a scampi, delicious.  -Steak Diane - Medallions of certified angus beef steak covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and grilled onions. Great! -Pumpkin Cheesecake - If you like pumpkin pie you'll adore this just the same.  All sorts of drinks and a full bar is available. Something to note is that The Factory has it's own line of wine, I believe beer as well (I may be wrong on that).  Prices are in the $5-20ish range.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=40
Tasha T.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",2,5,1,1.0,8/23/2017,"Unfortunately, I was highly disappointed in my visit last night. Myself and my family were celebrating my husband's new coaching job and decided to have dinner at your restaurant.  Although I was pleased with the timely manner in which the team was able to seat us, the waitress was a but preoccupied and passed us a few times before bread was presented to the table or a drink order was taken.  Due to the fact that I too work in customer service, I was able to give her the benifit of the doubt understanding she was busy.  Once my order was placed and received, I was highly disappointed in the Mac and cheese that I'd ordered as a side dish. It was extremely watery and lacked in flavor. When expressed to the waitress, she said ok and took the side away.  Not once did she offer to replace it or compensate me for it in any way.  My suggestion to you if this issue should accure in the future is to make sure your customers receive all the food they pay for.   As I may not continue to frequent your restaurant in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=40

Jason B.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",56,296,439,3.0,1/23/2017,"3.5 stars... Let's be honest, the sandwiches and pastas we eat here are just a ploy to get the cheesecakes for dessert... Started out with the Mexican egg rolls... Tex-mex filling wrapped in a crispy wrapper served with avocado dressing...my only complaint was they were a bit greasy. My wife and I split the dip sandwich and BBQ chicken salad. Both were tasty and as advertised. The wait was a bit excessive and I think it was the waitstaff as I had to send back cold fries for fresher reinforcements. Now to the main event... My wife played it safe and ordered her consistent favorite fresh banana, as always refreshing and flavorful. It was a bit icy leading us to believe these might be frozen cheesecakes?!? I opted for Chris's outrageous. Coconut, brownie, cheesecake, frosting, cake...where does it end one might ask...my stomach is always the reply.

Adrienne M.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,76,161,3.0,1/9/2017,"Yelp 100 Challenge: 2/100 ""I don't 'do' chain restaurants or fast food"" says the date who's body clearly didn't come from fruits and vegetables, nor butter and champagne. Although, such a comment was made at the Cheesecake Factory at The Grove many centuries ago, one may never forget. The Cheesecake Factory is where you go to bring yourself back down to size. With the many LA restaurants, dinners at Mr. Chow, driving around MILK only to scurry in and out before the parking people  show up, it is a consistent and tasty place amid all of the madness. The menu is very much book like, they quite literally, have it all! Asian cuisine, some breakfast items served all day, and about a million different cheesecake flavors. This location is almost always crowded and we waited nearly an hour for one of the smaller tables. No complaints there, it's busy most times even on weekdays. I had the veggie burger which Cheesecake describes as ""A Delicious ""Burger"" Made with Brown Rice, Farro, Mushrooms, Black Beans and Onion"". The burger is huge, piping hot and the fries were well seasoned. Not bad for a meatless Monday! The orange chicken an lemon ricotta pancakes are worth a mention her as well. I would return during breakfast hours, they open pretty early at 10am on weekends. Sometimes the bakery staff can be less than savory which is a bit of a complaint, but nothing to go into detail about. I will return if I'm feeling fancy, but not LA fancy because it's definitely one of the better chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=60

We got there at 5:45 on Friday night and the bartender was accommodating at taking our order before 6 pm as that is when happy hour is over but she never asked us how our food was or if we needed a refill ...

I'm a basic man who knows what he wants and rarely steers away from it. I usually like to start with the dark honey oat bread. I feel like they never make enough of it because the waiter and waitress' are always so stingy with it and keep bringing out a white bread or their out of the honey oat bread. I could eat that bread for days.  On to the appetizers, while I'm sure they have all types of amazing appetizers, the best one is the avocado egg rolls. Literally, i can go to this place and just get 3 orders of these things. Dare I say one of gods gift to earth? Lol. Now for entree's they have some AMAZING options. Usually my go to's are the Chicken Fettuccini alfredo, BBQ Chicken salad and last but not least the Santa Fe Salad. I'm sure there are so many more that I would like but never gave them a chance. This place is great for a date and they have valet parking.  Finally, their cheesecake, while it is still pretty good, it is not the best I've tried. Pretty good stuff but for being called ""The Cheese Cake Factory"" I think you can do better than you currently are. I've tried over 7 of their cheesecakes and have yet to be blown away by one.

At all the other Cheesecake Factories, the salad comes with good portions of asparagus, goat cheese, beets, pecans, and mixed greens. At this location, it comes with 5 cups of mixed greens, one spear of asparagus cut into four pieces, a tablespoon of pecans, a tablespoon of beets, and a teaspoon of goat cheese.

Yeah, their food is typical but I do enjoy their portion sizes and how huge their textbook menus are. I'm currently on a diet so it's nice that they have a Skinnylicious menu - all items are under 590 calories and once again their portions are huge! My usual is the Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo with brown rice (sooooo delicious) but since that's a whopping 1600 calories I opted for the skinnylicious Mexican Tortilla Salad which was only 570 calories. It was packed with so much flavor and since it was a big portion I took half of it home. I have to add that Cheesecake needs to add more vegan options to their menu. My friend is currently fasting and has to go vegan and it was nearly impossible to find anything without modifying all the ingredients. Our server Jason was a champ though! He made sure to accommodate my friend and came back to our table countless times to give us modifications. Hands down best server there!

But what I'm most upset about is I order their desserts fairly often (to go) and I've been noticing the slices have been getting more slender, but tonight's portion was just RIDICULOUS ! I ordered a ""tower truffle cake"" and was beyond disappointed! I understand if you have to make cuts here and there, but I feel like I got gypped ! It was literally half of a half slice, for $10.95..absolutely not worth it. If you're going to serve child portions then you should charge something more reasonable, I mean really.

Zayin M.,"Northeast Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,25,,4.0,4/4/2017,"Corporate food and robot attitude to the max, but if you're ok with that, then the various locations may be to your liking.  Personally, I can't stand their cheesecake, but I think they have the best burger n' fries in LA (I don't eat fries; I always substitute their killer mashed potatoes).  Interestingly, they also used to have the best veggie burger I've ever tasted - made with mostly fresh beets, veggies and beans (not 90% soy protein).  But they took it off the menu, and replaced it with the ubiquitous low-quality soy protein kind. They've recently raised their prices again, so I won't be eating dinner at any CF anymore - just the before 5pm lunch specials from now on.   And I never tire of their cobb salad.  I didn't like cobb salad at all, till I first had theirs.  In the 30 years I've been a customer, I've had terrible experiences and great experiences (the one in Sherman Oaks is the most inconsistent; the one in the Marina is the most reliable; the one in Beverly Hills is inbetween) - but overall, I never hesitate to eat at CF.  If we can't think of a place to go, we'll often just end up at a CF.   But why do they call it Cheesecake Factory? - the cheesecake is truly mediocre (I know everyone thinks its great - but millions of people think McDonald's is edible food, too).  Anyway, the high staff turnover tells you something (and not something good, of course), but I'm still solid on giving the whole chain 4 stars all the way (sorry, 5 is out of the question, as that would suggest that the food has been prepared/cooked by human hands).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=80

Lily L.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,116,186,3.0,8/25/2016,"It's the cheesecake factory what else can I say? Depending on when you get here there's usually at least a short wait or a really long wait if you get here at dinner time on most days but especially Thursday Friday and Saturday. I like this location better then where it was previously on Canoga and victory. The service here is OK. Since it's pretty busy here most of the time, it can be hard to get the attention of a waiter or waitress sometimes.  It's nice that they bring bread to the table, my favorite being the brown bread it's usually warm. My second favorite thing about this place is their skinnylicious menu. Believe it or not this is a good place to come if you want to eat healthy. Although I'm sure the sodium count on even their light meals is pretty high. I came here a lot when I was dieting for my wedding and their salads really helped me stick to my diet.  Overall this is a good place to come to with the family and they have a large variety of cheesecakes as well, my favorite being the dulce de leche. Lastly they have outdoor seating pretty much in the mall. It's a nice place to sit if you're lucky enough to come at an off time and be able to get a seat there.

First of all, I LOVE their cheesecake...I can eat it all day long if it wasn't for the calories... I always order a delivery from this Cheesecake Factory location, and after this last delivery, I don't think I'll order again. First of all, we all know that the Cheesecake Factory ALWAYS provides complimentary bread (so delicious!) Anyway...since I only ordered 2 slices of cheesecake (my first time ordering just the dessert because I've had sushi dinner), the delivery person said that they couldn't provide another slice of ""complimentary"" bread (see the photo I added for what I received). I explicitly asked for the wheat brown bread...but they couldn't provide me that according to the delivery person (I received white bread) because one of the staff said my order was ONLY two slices of cheesecake... That is very impolite ... I paid about $18 just for those two slices of cheesecake that include a ""service fee"" So I called Cheesecake Factory and one of the staff transferred me to Veronica who didn't sound so nice on the phone...maybe it was a long day, I understand. Veronica claims that what the delivery person stated wasn't true.. Hmm ok ... How can she know it wasn't true? Now I wonder who handled my order...sounds very defensive to me. Honestly, no matter how good or bad the food is, as long as the service is great and friendly, that's what keeps me from coming back...

Maybe 10-15 more minutes had passed and she finally came back to take our order. She seemed to have great knowledge of the menu, however, the service was AWFUL. She never came to check on us, another server had to refill my beverage, and she eventually came back to give me the cheese that was originally supposed to be added to my salad but instead thrown in a bowl. She had to walk by our table to take care of her other tables so I don't quite understand why she simply didn't stop by our table on the way to the others to check up on us. The food was OKAY. My chicken inside one of the enchiladas was slightly burned but I just ate around it. 2 stars for the prompt seating. Other than that, everything seemed to go downhill.

The honey chipotle pasta with extra chicken, no peas add onions/bellpeppers, and my all time favorite the factory burrito grande. Salads, appetizers, desserts=YUMMYYY.

Christina D.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,64,,2.0,8/7/2017,Was there yesterday for dinner. The service was poor. Took at least 30 minutes from the time we ordered until the food was served. Food was barely warm. I ordered the hibachi steak.  The food itself was good but it was missing the asparagus which the waitress has to bring to me after I told her it was missing from the plate. Also it was NOT wasabi mashed potatoes. Just the regular mashed potatoes. I knew it was not wasabi mashed potatoes because my mom had the lemon herb chicken and we got the same type of mashed potatoes. Very disappointing as we usually love eating there!

The ambience was casual but nice; the waitress was attentive despite being overwhelmed since it was really busy this particular night on Thursday.  I ordered the cheese pizza and mozzarella triangles and my friend ordered the salmon. The wait time for the food was a bit long but while we waited we got to hear the staff sing happy birthday to several different tables who were all celebrating a birthday the same day, the food came and it met our standards and the standards of Cheesecake as I've come to know.

Cheesecake Factory always has HUGE portions, for lunch and dinner. I wish they had an option for a smaller portion at dinner since I'd rather pay less and get less. I always have to take food home!

Ellen I.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,41,1,2.0,1/28/2017,"Generally speaking I leave The Cheesecake Factory with a to-go box, as I have never actually finished a meal there. Last night, however, I left the restaurant hungry.  In short, after an hour wait (not the estimated 40 minutes), which was understandable due to it being a Friday evening, we were shown to a table in the mall. You know the place--next to the closed Sears location. Ordinarily, not an issue, but it was cold last night. Everyone in the section was wearing a jacket. As it was late, and given the fact that it was a busy Friday, we put our jackets on and sucked it up.  Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Three meals satisfactory, mine cold. Not just warm from the trek from the kitchen across several dining rooms to the mall warm, but cold. Pre-prepped mashed potatoes that were scooped out of a bowl without warming. Broccoli that went a tad past crisp-tender to blanched and sitting in ice water. So I sent it back. I told my dinner mates to eat, lest theirs get cold.  So 15 minutes (and three clean platers) later, my dish arrived. The waitress apologized for the issue and walked away. The plate itself was warm, but if it was possible, the food was actually colder than when I sent it back the first time.  I handed my plate to the first person I could find and asked to have the meal removed from my bill. Which it was.  A manager came over to apologize and ask if he could bring me another meal, some cheesecake, a to-go box, something, anything? Thanks, but no thanks. I really did not need to subject us all to another 20 minutes of sitting in the cold mall. Besides, ironically, I had spent a good part of the day baking an elaborate triple chocolate mousse birthday cake, so a slice of cheesecake wasn't going to placate me.  While I appreciate the manager showing up to make amends, I have to say, this chain has been around for a long time, and this wasn't the first busy Friday night. If a plate comes back because the food is cold, the expediter shouldn't send it back to a customer unless there is steam rising from the mashed potatoes! In the main, I find The Cheesecake Factory a fun and satisfying place to eat, especially with people whose palates are all over the place. I had a situation arise about six months ago with a location in New Jersey, and during a call with corporate, I said that I wouldn't Yelp the experience because it was a ""training opportunity"" that I was sure they would address. (Curiosity seekers can reference my Maggiano's review.) Had that situation not happened, I probably wouldn't have bothered with this one because not every service meets the ideal. Someone draws the short straw, and last night it was I.  But this is two strikes, Cheesecake Factory. Three, and you're out.

As I was leaving I know I remember placing my expensive glasses on the table looking for my wallet to pay and I know cause that's where I left them $400 Tom Ford Sunglasses and  I realized walking out , right away I went back n they were gone SUPPOSEDLY NONE of the staff saw them (LIARS BTW) the mgr LAUREN BLONDE VERY RUDE by the way was not being a good manager trying to rush me out after my family n I just ate there n gave our business .... She was very rude n unsympathetic... said she had an honest staff ... just how honest are the staff though ... no other dining customers were sitting near us we were in the back toward the mall , ... I'm sure corporate would love to hear about this supposedly honest staff who takes thing that don't belong to them ... ALL I CAN SAY is Lauren shouldn't be a Manager ... on top of that why I really could tell she was rushing me is because she did not even ask me to get my number in the first place I had to call back in case anybody did find anything she just rushed me and wanted me to leave like she couldn't handle a tough situation, That's not a manager that's just somebody who is lazy and doesn't want to do their job . So be careful when leaving your items even keys on the table because one of the staff members can come by and steal them ... i'm sure corporate's gonna love to hear about this. I'm not one to complain or give  bad reviews, Because the service was phenomenal in the beginning it was until I went back and everybody just lied that's not an honest that and that's definitely not a good manager",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=180

I am a frequent Cheesecake Factory diner, and love all of their cheesecakes, especially ""The Chocolate Tuxedo Cake"". Their service is excellent, however their food quality seems to be lacking. I get their jambalaya pasta every single time, and the past 3 or 4 times the pasta seems to be dry and not so tasty! Maybe a new chef?

Clarissa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",131,222,1617,4.0,10/21/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory always hits the spot. My go-to restaurant because they're open a bit later than other places and I love the wide variety of choices on their menu.    I went to this location a few nights ago for dinner with my friend. Our server was Mario. He's super nice and got us everything we asked for. I come to this location often with my boyfriend and we've had him as our server several times too. Always good service from him.  My absolute favorite on the menu is the pasta da vinci (penne pasta with chicken, mushrooms, caramelized onions, and a Marsala cream sauce). I'm also addicted to the brown, honey oat bread that they bring as an appetizer. When I came a few nights ago, I tried their cucumber lemonade for the first time. SO GOOD. It tastes really refreshing and there's free refills. And of course, their desserts are delicious. Some of my favorites are the tiramisu, white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, and tiramisu cheesecake. A few others are too sweet for my liking.  All in all, I love coming here to satisfy my cravings.

Ferlay S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",215,184,323,5.0,2/26/2016,"Cheesecake Factory has received the honor from my group of pals as the ultimate ""go-to"" place for GOOD food, GOOD service, and all around good times. This location has nestled itself nicely in the Topanga Mall, right smack where the Sears used to be and right across from Forever21. I choose this location as a fave, because if you're familiar with Cheesecake Factory, you know you will most likely wait awhile to get seated. The great thing about this location is that ""waiting"" can turn into something productive. They ask for your phone number so  they can text you. Nope, they don't give you those annoying, useless .1223942 mile radius pagers that just confine you to the waiting area of the restaurant so you can see your life and stomach pass by as the hostess calls out parties before you. That being said, there's a huge mall to walk around in while you wait! Go get your new pair of jeans before you get too bloated after dinner! Take advantage of that sale at H&M or snoop around Apple just to kill time on your facebook games. Orrrr better yet, you can get all your shopping musts done at Target.  It seems smaller than it's former location, but they are very swift with their service. My menu faves are:  -Tex Mex Rolls (appetizer) -Avocado Rolls (appetizer) -Chicken Piccata -Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp -Luau Salad  -Chicken and Biscuits -Hibachi Steak -Miso Salmon (with brown rice!) Cheesecake Faves:  -White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle (rich with a touch of tangy fruit!) -Mango Key Lime (tropical, light, and tasty!) -Banana (light, basic, and delish!) -White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut (richhhhh) -Lemon Raspberry Cream (light and amazing!

We were seated and our server, Erin, was right there to take our drink order. I had the filet mignon medium rare, my wife had the chicken piccata, and my daughter had the spaghetti. The filet was perfect made as requested, extremely tender cut of meat. My wife enjoyed the chicken which I tried was really good as well. Erin was our server and she was amazing.

But service isn't the main thing at these type of restaurants. Food is what we want and sadly the food just didn't taste as well as it should have been. My mother had the Jambalaya and it tasted very bland. My dad had the farfalle and it too did not have the right kick of flavor to it. For me I went simple with some calamari and a sausage pizza. The calamari was too airy and did not adhere to the palettes on my tongue.  The sausage pizza was mainly just a cheese pizza with one small sausage on every slice. I'm not exaggerating either.

We rushed to the main entrance, check in and were told we would be seated. 5 minutes goes by, 10 minutes goes by... It's starting to get packed in the entrance at an uncomfortable level. People were stepping all over each other, patrons were confused which line was to check in, which was to be seated, who was standing around, who was waiting. It was a disaster. This never happens at the other location. After 15 minutes of dodging people, we were seated.

So On Sunday, My boyfriend and I decided to go in and order a 10 inch cheesecake for Tuesday (today) for my sisters birthday since she doesn't really like cake. The girl taking our order was very nice and polite and asked us if we wanted the cheesecake ready to serve because if not it would be frozen but all we needed to do was leave it out for about an hour or two and it would be ready to serve. I let her her know that I would pick it up at 5 and I needed it ready to serve as my sister and her boyfriend had reservations for dinner so I needed it ready to go. I called today (the day to pick up) let them know if be there by 5 and to please make sure it was cut and ready to serve. I show up around 5:15 and they initially didn't know what I was speaking of, they fumbled around looking for it and finally after about 15-20 min the manager came over and explained to me that the cheesecake was still frozen and I would need to leave it out for about 2 hours. I let him know that I could not do that and I was already running late so I needed anything he had ready to serve, mind you I paid almost $60 for this 12 slice cheesecake... He then said he could have another cake but I would need to wait for it to be ready and they could not cut it and could offer me some water while I wait. Yes, water.

I paid through CakePay and they were very quick with bringing the order out to me. I saw that there were two containers of food but didn't inspect them closely. Upon arriving home we noticed that one of the entrees consisted of steak and broccoli, but was missing the mashed potatoes. I called them with the intention of letting them know I was just going to come back to grab it.  I was placed on hold two times with two different people before speaking to the manager (mind you, I never asked to speak with him). They didn't let me finish speaking before transferring me over to the next person.

Tiffany H.,"Calabasas, CA",170,188,366,4.0,8/20/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is my go-to restaurant when I don't really know what I feel like eating. Because their menu is SO large with SO many options to choose from. Just recently, they added a ""Superfoods Section"" that hosts a selection of healthier ingredients. This particular location isn't exactly my favorite because the restaurant is a little too small for my liking. I preferred the prior location on Canoga Ave. due to the higher ceiling and wider space. But I've had pretty good dining experiences here thus far. The service is very good and everyone is friendly. It just gets a little loud and hectic because it is in the Topanga Mall.   My favorite pasta is the Four Cheese pasta! So many different oozy cheeses with creamy texture! I always get this dish when I come here. Definitely worth the try! I also really like the pretzel crusted chicken appetizer served on skewers with delicious dipping sauces.  For dessert, i actually enjoy the strawberry shortcake the most. The biscuits have cane sugar on top for an added crunch and tons of ice cream and strawberries all over. I also love their seasonal cheesecakes such as the peppermint bark and pumpkin pie cheesecake.

Vijay C.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",39,266,38,1.0,2/28/2016,"Where do I begin? I ordered a cheesecake on December 23 and went to pick it up shortly after 5pm. Never mind how expensive it was and that it tasted off for some reason. My problem was the customer service.  I waited and waited and waited for my cheesecake to be ready. As did others. I stood at the bakery growing more and more impatient. Then some server told me I needed to move because I was in the walkway, which admittedly I sort of was but at least a half dozen employees were able to pass me and didn't make any comment at all about it. But for some reason this server decided to angrily tell me to move out of the way because, and I quote, ""I am preventing people from doing their job"". My response was ""I'm not sure how me standing here is preventing the three people who are more than 5 feet away from me from doing their job"". She just made several sarcastic remarks that frankly irritated me given I was a customer and she was belittling me. One of the bakery workers saw this and rushed to get me my cheesecake so I can be happy and leave. I happily took the cheesecake and left the bakery area. Is this where the story ends? Nope. Some very tall individual in a blue dress shirt was behind the bakery register. He clearly looked like a manager. I went up to tell him that I did not appreciate the manner in which one of the servers talked to me. I wasn't going to ask for anything - especially since I already paid for my cheesecake about a half hour ago at this point - but to let him know that what happened. Well he didn't look like he cared at all about what I wanted to say or my feelings. He just wanted to help people in line at the register and ignored me. Normally I'd get incredibly angry at this and make a scene but at this point I had my cake and just wanted to go. Oh and to add injury to insult, this cheesecake which cost more than $40, did not taste right. Something about it was off. So yeah, terrible customer service, including from a probable manager and a lackluster product. Hence the One star review.  Update: 28 days later and no one from Cheesecake Factory has reached out to me. You would think they care about something like this, especially when I outright call out a manager for poor customer service but I guess they don't care as long as they got paid for their goods. A place like the yardhouse in Northridge immediately reached out to me when I left a poor review. I have since become a regular there. I highly recommend the yardhouse and I highly dissuade you from the Cheesecake Factory.  Update. It's now two months later and still nothing. They really just don't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=220

It's so disappointing- anytime my boyfriend and I want to go out to eat we always came to this location (no joke like twice a week). Every visit is worse than the last. My last visit 100% hit the point of no return. My BF always orders the steak Diana a $20 dinner, the last 2 times he ordered it he received a burnt steak- said nothing and ate his plate. This visit his steak came out burnt again, he asked for the manager. Every piece of steak was chard and the manager had nothing but excuses of why the steak was burnt- like they sear their meat. We have ordered this plate 100s of times and never had a problem until recently. After all the excuses and stories, we received no apology and no maters of working anything out. It took us 30 minutes to get our seats and 45 minutes to receive our food and now we have to wait for his food to be recooked. Now I'm sitting with my plate of food, which I ordered the salmon- dry and tasteless. I'm staving but not trying to eat without my BF he's pissed off and starving too. He gets up to go smoke and wait for his food. I'm sitting by myself and the waiter comes us and asked me how my food was, I answered, kinda hard to enjoy considering the situation, he says sorry and walks away. 3 mins later a different manager comes up and says let me take that plate for you, AND TAKES MY PLATE. I instantly felt unwelcome and that they wanted us to leave. WHY ARE YOU TAKING MY PLATE?! WHAT KIND OF MANAGERS DO YOU GUYS HAVE WORKING HERE!?!! So I left.. I've never felt so embarrassed and like I needed to defend myself. Since you guys have moved into the mall, the customers and food don't matter any more.

Ej F.,"Woodland Hills, CA",427,498,1568,4.0,10/19/2013,"(+) Food is great as expected.  Drinks too.  Huge menu (with ads) like any other Cheesecake Factory.  Amazing how much they offer for a factory that makes cheesecake. (+) Better parking availability than the Canoga location (+) Probably since it's a new location, but servers still look a little lost when they are bring out food, questioning themselves if they're going to the right table (this is amusing to me, never gets old). (+) Go shopping while you wait for your table, well not sure how far the buzzer range is but at least you can do more people watching at the mall while you wait. (+) THAT FREE BROWN BREAD THOUGH!!! (-) Limited outdoor seating compared to the Canoga location (-) Bar area could be bigger.  I think it's a first come first serve seating area with full menu available but I'm not sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=240

The hostess said it had been 22 min. & she had me for a 30 min. wait special it would be another 10 min. The hostess  needs to do a better job on timing the wait list.

I feel that the best part is when you are waiting for your table, you can go shopping & they will text you when your table is ready instead of using a buzzer. Our meal started with the famous brown & white bread with butter. Always fresh and crunchy. Our waitress was Sarah & she was super friendly. My family decided to start with the avocado egg rolls appetizer. My personal favorite, I enjoyed how the fresh avocado cubes go so well with the crunch of the egg rolls breading. They also have a sweet green sauce that adds a complicating taste to the all ready good egg roll.  I decided to stay on the healthy path as usual and go with the ""skinnylicious"" turkey burger(no mayo) with a salad. I thought they did a good job giving a dinner dish under 600 calories. I thought the Caramelized onions worked well with the turkey burger. The salad, however, was very disappointing. It was bland, and didn't have any significant taste to it. I ended up taking two bites & giving up on it. I enjoyed my dinner experience and would come back. The salad was really disappointing. I do think the 4 out of 5 was well deserved. Solid meal that filled me up for under 1000 calories all together. Thanks for taking the time to read my review :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=260

As we were about to be seated, our host told us that we had to leave our stroller near the front desk as it couldn't go with us to our seat because it was an aisle seat.  This was very strange as my 4 month old was with us and can't go in a high chair and all of our shopping bags were there. They said that this area is stroller parking and the staff would watch it, but it would just be in the open and I am uncomfortable leaving all my stuff there...so weird! I asked if it could at least go behind the desk or something. So i told them the aisle seat won't work and we can wait, but he insisted that we leave it.  Just very unprofessional and I don't want to deal with this. I ended taking the stroller with me as I saw that others had theirs with them.

I was enjoying my chicken Madeira and trying not to choke because I had nothing to wash it down! All jokes aside, it was kind of annoying. When I ordered dessert I saw her again and she seemed rushed and rushed me a bit when I was ordering. Given the huge selection of cheesecake slices available, it was a tough choice!

The portions are quite large -- we took about half home. Prices are in line. While we tried several different dishes and all ok, but nne were outstanding.

I would suggest coming out for happy hour or lunchtime specials if you want to go easy on your wallet and have as little server contact as possible. We ordered our drinks first, the aunties took a little longer but as a server you have to just deal with it, showing your incapability to wait will not earn you a bigger tip. Upon waiting for the drinks, the kids realized they could not wait too long for their food...again they are kids...its understandable they can not wait for their meals. They flagged down the server and ordered right away, the spicy chicken sandwich and the crispy shrimp platter in addition to the Oreo milkshake and cheesy garlic bread. The server took their order and left without asking if everyone else was ready to order and disappeared for 30 minutes only to return and tell the kids that they had no ice cream left and could not make the milkshake. The server took our party's order in a rude, rushed manner, rolling his eyes with every request. Almost an hour and a half passed before we saw our order, the groups next to us had sat down for their meal and left twice over, very irritating. Finally our food came, this was probably the only good about our cheesecake experience. I ordered the veggie burger with a side salad while my mother ordered the fish tacos. Pretty tasty. The fries that came with my uncle's sandwich were satisfactory, I like the ranch that came with them, not too heavy. The spicy chipotle sauce was good too. The cheesy garlic bread, by the way, was no where to be found and was not presented other than on the bill. The kids were also very disappointed with the waiter offered them ice cream desert and wondered why he couldn't make their milkshake if he indeed had the ice cream on hand. The manager came by and apologized stating that the waiter didn't explain that milkshakes and sundaes consisted of different ice cream. The manager offered to make the milkshake using the sundae ice cream but I told him to forget it as we were pretty much done with our meals and could not wait another 30 minutes for a milkshake that I could get from a Jack in the Box. I flagged down another waitress for my cousin's birthday sundae as I did not want to deal with our waiter again, she promptly brought out the sundae (wish we had her as our server) and sang happy birthday all by her lonesome self. We quickly paid and left after that. The food is good but they need to really improve the quality of customer service. Its pretty disappointing for an esteemed eatery. I will only comeback to this location for a quick happy hour/lunch special with a small party or to pick up a cheesecake slice to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=280

Kimberly at the Cheesecake Factory made our 1st birthday celebration a truly memorable one.  First, Kimberly offered to bring banana slices for the baby while we waited for our food.  Second, when a pacifier fell on the floor, Kimberly brought hot water from the kitchen so that we could sanitize it.  Third, Kimberly kept checking in with us, making sure that the baby was having a good time.  Fourth, Kimberly told other guests, many of whom had babies, that our little one is celebrating a birthday. As s result, another mom and a baby stopped by to say hi (which was very sweet.)  Fifth, Kimberly checked with us on the name spelling to make sure that the birthday cake contained the right spelling.  Last, Kimberly took several pictures of us (all of which turned out very nice.)  Even though she had plenty of other tables to attend to, Kimberly was extra attentive and very cheerful with us.

Michael F.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,39,91,2.0,3/20/2015,"In my experience it was overall bad. I just give them 2 stars because of the bar. Drink was good. First, long waiting line, over 45min and the server was in the rush for order/serve/check. I didn't enjoy my food. Second the quality was less than average, even our chickens was cold they heat it up again and bring it back, it took 15min. And next time the sauce was missing from plate! Third most of the meal was a little bit smaller than normal size. Finally at this class of restaurant you can find better option in this area, with better service and meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=280

Joyce R.,"West Hills, West Hills, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/13/2017,"I guess the heading ""Meh.  I've experienced better"" was automatically generated when I rated Cheesecake Factory two stars.   I should have rated it a 1.  I took my family of four for lunch, three ordered Fettucine Alfredo, the larger portion of the two offered,  and  I was shocked when it came.  If that was the large, you'd probably need a microscope to see the small. And it comes with nothing else.  How can they charge what they do for a few bites of pasta?  Shame on them.  I ordered the Pit Beef Au Jus, side of mashed.  It was all potatoes and a weird tasting roll.  Like the old commercial, ""Where's the Beef?""  And there was no ""au jus,"" they said it was coming.  After 10 minutes or so with everything getting cold, I tried to hail a waiter.  Finally had to get up and  find someone to ask for the rest of my order.  We ordered dessert, the strawberry cheesecake was the only good part of lunch.   I don't remember quality or service ever being so bad, portions so stingy, and food so unappetizing.  Something has happened to the Cheescake Factory, it's not the same, and I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=280

However, the accommodations at todays breakfast was beyond disappointing. Upon being seated, I reached for my napkin only to pull spoiled pits and nuts onto my lap that was underneath my napkin. That being the start of my experience, I received stale bread and a bagel hard , stale and tasteless. My Omelette was not much different. It was bland and tasteless. This establishment might be able to get get away with this sub- standard quality for fly by night tourist.

Came to celebrate my birthday with my aunt. I got the beef dip sandwich and she got a Caesar salad. Big portions. For Dessert we got the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake. They are very good but really sweet,  it could be shared with at least three people. Our waitress was very very nice! Even had some people take pictures for us. Our waitress was even nice enough to write a nice birthday message on my receipt as well as everyone singing happy birthday to me. So cool!!!

I worked at the location in the Trillium nearly a decade ago and I haven't been able to break myself of craving their flavors ever since. Everything is just so good, and I can tell you first-hand as someone who's been on the inside, they take a lot of care with their food and service.  I've been ordering my stuff to-go lately, which I feel is the ideal way to do it, as they are SO busy should you choose to dine in. To-go also ensures that you don't end up waiting more than a pre-set period of time.  They are aptly named The Cheesecake Factory. There's a plethora of awesome (and quite expensive) flavors to choose from for dessert; my favorite is the White Chocolate Raspberry, but they have an option for just about everybody. My only comment otherwise is that this definitely isn't dense New York-style cheesecake, so if that's what you're looking for, you will not find it here.  Their new location has them on the outskirts of the Topanga Mall. It's not necessarily a glamorous location, between mall traffic on the inside and cars passing by on the outside, but I don't recommend going for the atmosphere.

Danis F.,"Chatsworth, CA",155,45,39,5.0,11/7/2016,"My wife, friend and I had an absolutely exquisite experience at this location on Saturday. The valet service was modern and efficient. We parked our car right by the front door, and we were sent a text message with a link to retrieve our car. The Cheesecake Factory restaurant itself was very well-maintained. I was surprised at how clean the men's restroom was despite the restaurant being completely full. While we were waiting for our table, I had the opportunity to visit the bar. There were no available spots, and the bartender went out of his way to approach me. I have some experience as a bartender, and I watched as he made the drinks - all the proportions were by the book. When the time came for us to be seated, we were approached by a very friendly lady who took us to our table. Our waitress was also very happy and cheerful. We ordered a rather complicated order with a lot of modifications, and everything was delivered to our table exactly how we ordered it. The food was of the classic Cheesecake Factory variety: consistent, well-prepared and reasonably priced. We brought our own Champagne, and it was opened for us with proper glasses, put on ice, and a towel was provided. The corkage fee was more than reasonable. As we were eating, we experienced a small problem with our table. We brought it to the staff's attention, and the manager immediately came out, apologized profusely and moved us to another table. When we asked for the check, the manager personally brought it to us and comped a large portion of our order. All in all, I was so impressed with the entire evening that I chose to write this review. I can't believe that this place is rated so low on Yelp. We got Beverly Hills service at Cheesecake Factory prices. Maybe people are upset because of the wait, but ... nothing can be done about that. The food, the service, the location and the attention are great. No wonder people keep coming. I will 100% be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=300

When then proceed to order our food. I order the lettuce wraps my brother order a breakfast plate. after what felt like an hour of wait for our food its finally arrived. My lettuce wraps were something soo different from what i ordered. I told the waiter that this wasnt what i order. that i wanted lettuce wraps, so he took my food, then my brother takes a bite out of the bagel he received with his breakfast plate. The bagel was sooooooo hard he couldnt bite a piece off. So the waiter comes back with my lettuce wraps and turns out all they did was make the food they gave me into lettuce tacos. I told him to take the food back and take it off my bill and we also told him about the bagel. he took it back. Then after we were done eating they came singing happy birthday and he asks out loud where is the birthday ""boy"" my daughter looks at him and says im a ""girl"". like serious dude.

The server was pretty nice. I think his name was Adam. He was very attentive and it sounded like he tried almost everything on the menu and complimented on our choices. :) I recommend getting the brown bread and get extras! lol It comes out of the oven. The sourdough is good too but the brown (i think it's oat) bread is the best!  The menu is unbelievably huge. I just tend to order the same - I usually get the white bean chili with the rice. Their pasta dishes it can be a hit or miss. I got the garlic noodle this time around and it wasn't very garlic-y. It was ok. I think I had something in mind and it missed expectation. I think I was expecting something dry and this was wet just because it was pasta with white wine or something and a bunch of garlic.

My friends got the Fettuccine Alfredo w/ Chicken and the Macaroni and Cheese Burger. They both really liked their food. Of course you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory with having some cheesecake.

Plus, it wasn't a HUGE portion like their regular menu items. The portion size was just right. Not too small, not too big. I was happy. I will definitely order that again, as well as ask for Stephen.  For dessert, I was a fatty and ordered the S'mores and Strawberry cheesecakes to go. The strawberry was good.

I've always known the serving staff to be bright and while she was in no way disrespectful or neglectful, her shift ended in the middle of my meal and handed us off to another server. Having been a server myself, I understand that there are times when you have to leave whether it's a personal reason or the manager forces you off the floor and so I was grateful that she took the time to introduce me to the server who would be taking over.

Sasha M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,28,,2.0,12/21/2014,"Came here to have a nice anniversary dinner. Did not end up that way. This placed has changed a lot since it was on Canoga in Woodland Hills. First, we approached a very nice  host gentleman who told us the wait was 15 mins. Cool. He said we'd get a text when our table was ready. We got the text, came right away, and was told to wait. We ended up waiting about another 15 mins. So i guess our table wasn't ready... Then we sit down and there's still someone else's check with money in it sitting on our table. I tried to give it to the hostess that sat us. She just told me she couldn't take it, or tell our server to come take it. It also made me wonder if the table had been wiped down because the last people's check wasn't moved. So we sat about 15 more mins when our waitress came to take both our drink and food orders. I could have used water a little earlier but what ever. We get our bread at the end of taking our order.  The food didn't take too long, what you'd expect for that caliber of restaurant. It also was pretty good, which is why they get the second star. Most annoying though, was being sat next to the kitchen and hearing people hooping and hollering about the foot ball game on the TV above us. Hard to have a nice anniversary dinner that way. After paying, I asked to talk with the manager. It ended up being an older brunnette (i think) lady. She did not seem to care. She kept saying I should have told her sooner so she could have made it better or done something. I wasn't trying to get anything for free. Then she tried to tell me some of what I didn't like was just the way they did things. I just thought that management should hear about a shitty experience so they can try to improve. She just did not care.  I went back to my table and it had been cleared (funny that it happened so fast because it wasn't cleared when we got there) and my hat I left on the seat was gone. I asked the server, she asked a busser in front of me. Both of them said they hadn't seen it, and I guess that was it. I waited in front of the table for about five mins before i decided to go ask for the manager again.  When explaining it to her, a host over heard and brought me my hat. Once again, the manager did not care that no one would help me find my hat. She just kind of pushed me out the door.

After another 15 minutes of waiting, we again asked what was taking so long and the same hostess assured us that our name was just about to be called. After yet another 10 minutes of waiting (I'm being objective), I insisted on speaking with the manager. When the manager arrived, the hostesses claimed that not only was our name already called (which it certainly was not), but that we had already received a text notifying us that our table was ready (a bold-faced lie). One of the hostesses even had the audacity to claim that she had never seen me before.  Though we were eventually seated and had a good lunch, the lack of professional courtesy and attention was disgusting.

French Country is a nice appetizer of mixed salad greens tossed in a light vinaigrette with beets, pecans & goat cheese Complimentary Sourdough & Squaw bread  I'm so predictable when it comes to my entree, I usually order the Lemon-herb roasted chicken.  The chicken is moist, sits on a good amount of creamy red potato mash cooked in a nice zesty sauce and topped with fresh herbs; portions are generous I recently ordered the Shepard's Pie and wasn't thrilled-its too heavy/saucy, the ground beef inconsistent in texture, with large chunks of ground beef within tender smaller ground beef; mash is always creamy good  Chicken Maderia is decent I've had a few of their cheesecakes.  Most recently: Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake With dessert I usually get a hot cuppa water and the tea selection-NOA & Numi  The patio maybe refreshing for some, it is certainly comfortable as far as tempurature-stays toasty on cold evenings, but uncomfortable as far as seating goes. On my last visit the table behind us couldn't get in an out of his seat without excusing himself and vice versa. Self parking is off Trillium-in the business park parking structure, 2-hours are free with validation. Valet is available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=340

The pieces of chicken were bigger than ever and cooked perfectly. They finally gave enough lettuce wraps, so I didn't run out. All the ingredients tasted fresh. The Avocado Egg Rolls were huge and perfectly cooked. They seemed much bigger than ever before. Also, they weren't cold in the middle. I love the green sauce they come with. The Vegi Burger was outstanding. It was my first time getting this. It was huge and delicious. I would absolutely get this again. The service was amazing. I wish I would have got our server's name.

We usually share a bottle of wine and a selection of appetizers during lunch. We usually are always seated fast here. The last time we went there was no wait at all which was nice. The restaurant is large, clean and they have decent music playing.  The staff is usually fantastic. The reason I write this review is because last time we went our server didn't arrive for over 15 minutes, arrived took our drink order and then didn't bring our drinks for another 15 minutes. We were still waiting when the nicest young lady came over (whom was also a waitress) and went and got our drink order right away, I'm talking 1 minute or less. She then took our entire order. To top it off she brought our original waiter to the table and schooled him on what we ordered and how to run things, I assume he was new. She was truly a gem and I've had her wait on us twice. Her name slips my mind at the moment, but she rocked. Made a bad experience into an awesome one.  Also we spilled a glass of wine and a bus boy helped us in about 10 seconds cleaning it up.

J R.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,30,3,3.0,9/4/2015,"We went for dinner here mid-week (Wednesday evening).  To my surprise, the parking was a bit full.  That is probably due to the location being a shopping center.  Otherwise once we walked in, the wait for 3 people for dinner was 10-15 minutes.  The noise level is dependent on where you sat.  We were near the bar, so it was pretty loud and hard to make a conversation.  If you sit toward the back or outside, it would be a better location for a conversational dinner. They start off by offering you bread and butter (sourdough and whole wheat grain) and it was brought to our table warm.  We started off with fried calamari for appetizer, which was delicious but quite greasy.  It would have been better if they allowed it to sit a little longer to drain the oil.  It was served with a red cocktail sauce and garlic dip.  The cocktail sauce tasted like any traditional cocktail sauce and the garlic dip tasted more like mayonnaise and Dijon mustard with a hint of garlic.  It wasn't bad but this dish and its dips could use a little improvement. My dinner selection was from the skinny menu, Golden Steak Medallion.  It was served with roasted asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and freshly mashed potatoes (not the kind you'd get out of a box).  The steak can be cooked to your liking, I chose medium well.  It was not over-seasoned and I could still taste the flavor of the angus steak.  It's not overly large portion so it was a perfect size for my appetite. The service was good, our server was Adam.  He did an excellent job making sure we got our food on time and checked on us if we needed anything.  We tipped him 19% of our bill.  Don't misunderstand the 3-star rating, the food was mediocre but our server did a great job.

Again, we complained to the manager - nothing. Does anyone think this is acceptable?  We were not seated until 7 PM, 3 of us had to sit in their stupid bar for 2 1/2 hours.  I don't care what the food is like, this is no way to treat your patrons when they are trying to have a special dinner.  I also do not care what their rules are, if they can't offer decent customer service, no way am I ever going back.  No compensation was offered either, you would think the least they could have done is bought the birthday girl a drink or give her a free dessert.  Very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=320

Amir K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",7,59,25,1.0,9/3/2015,"I'm still reeling from this move.  Yes, the Trillium was a complete dump and never caught on because of the hideous pink granite tiles that covered the entire inside and outside of the building, but at least the Cheesecake Factory was HUGE with a great wait staff and laid out better than any other restaurant in the valley.  It's been a few years now since they've gone to the old CPK location and it's simply not enough space nor wait staff to handle the type of business that Cheesecake does.  They've also setup the patio, but it's the valley!  Nobody's going to sit outside for like 5 months out of the year due to the heat/cold.  Anyway, onto this particular experience...  They take your cellphone number to text you when your table's ready, but once you check-in with them you need to then wait another period of time until they seat you.  I can only assume that the point-of-sale alerts the hostess to call you when the credit card for the party vacating the table you're going to be on is swiped.  But some people like to hang around after paying the bill and shoot the breeze, thus causing this bizarre scenario where your table is ""ready"" but not really.  Moving past that, we ended up with absolutely atrocious service from our waiter who was either overworked or completely clueless.  Our drinks took nearly 20 minutes to come out and the food at least another 20.  The kitchen seemed like it was in total chaos.  I also saw the manager berate another waiter in front of us and both seemed visibly distraught over the situation.  Ironically enough, when it came time for us to pay, the waiter who was cut down by his manager helped us out by handling the check. Food:  Typical Cheesecake food.  Quality is good, portions are huge and there's always something for everyone on the menu.  Nothing ever stands out or is particularly memorable about the food, but everyone gets on well with whatever they ordered.  It's a known quantity. I hope for this restaurant's sake that it's planning on moving to the new part of Westfield that's designed to mimic the Grove.  If they signed a long-term lease here and are stuck in this little spot, I don't think I'm ever coming back given the new options that will inevitably open up once the build-out is complete.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=360

Jon B.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,10,,1.0,9/6/2016,"Cheesecake Factory offers a very good classic burger and/or kobe burger. I always eat it without the bun. Unfortunately, they have great difficulty cooking it to your desired request. It seems about every third or fourth visit, when I ask for either medium rare or medium, it either comes out almost completely uncoooked or well done. Today, my wife and I took the gamble again and we ordered the kobe burger, asking very pointedly that we would like it medium rare. We also ordered two cokes .My wife is delighted with her medium rare burger. Mine is nuked and well done.  The waitress takes it back and says it will take five or six minutes. Twelve minutes later, she returns with another burger.  My wife has been patiently not trying to finish hers out of courtesy to me as her burger is now getting cold. The manager asks me to check the new burger.  I cut into it and it's basically still breathing; raw as it can be.  He agrees and takes it back.  I tell him this will be the last time.  He returns about seven minutes later as my wife's burger is now cold and unappetizing. Upon his return, I cut open the burger again (the same burger) and it's still blood red. Manager says he's sorry, and he offers me a slice of cheesecake in place of the burger.  Being on a diet, I decline. Now being frustrated and growing a bit angry, I ask for the check.  The waitress returns about ten minutes later.  I am charged for one kobe burger and two drinks at $3.50 each.  They didn't even have the decency to comp the drinks after all that occurred. I paid and left.  I've had enough of this restaurant that is run like and back alley ""factory.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=360

At the table, our server/s didnt introduce themselves. When i asked they said why? I said so i can address you properly (duh??)  Food is a lot, it was a bit cold. The bread was a little stale.

Eric W.,"Canoga Park, CA",166,672,148,4.0,6/16/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory has been here as long as I can remember. My parents went here when I was in high school -- and that was a long time ago. I've been going here on and off for the better part of the last 10 years or so. It's a really dependable somewhat high-end restaurant -- good food and usually excellent service. I've also been to locations in other California cities. The menu is massive -- pages and pages of items. The adage that a restaurant should have a small menu and do a few things really well is thrown out here. (I've read a lot about Cheesecake Factory through the years including a recent LA Times piece and a Time magazine article. The company is open about their practices, how they choose their menu items, etc. The menu is entirely based on which items sell -- if one doesn't even if the executives like it, it's removed from the menu.) This location is large too. It has a sizable outdoor patio in back that overlooks a deserted small tennis stadium. The bar area is first come, first serve. There's almost always a lot of people waiting for tables in the front foyer. They start you off with a bread basket with both a wheat and French bread. Both are tasty and you have to focus on not eating too much. They'll bring you more. I can't think of a bad meal I've had at any Cheesecake Factory. They're consistently tasty if not always remarkable and memorable. Their drinks are usually delicious.  Their portions are huge. I remember reading that they're designed to take half to go. They now offer a nutritional guide along with your menu. This is helpful because some of the dishes are 2,000+ calories. Their new calorie friendly menu is called Skinnylicious and offers a lot of appetizers, salads and entrees. Some of the items are already on the main menu. Their cheesecake selection, naturally, is huge. Slices are big and rich. Getting one to go after your meal so you can have a few bites at home and put it in the fridge is a good idea. Parking is in the structure in back or valet. They validate. I've heard they train their servers for two weeks before they set them loose in restaurants. Service always seems to be their best attribute over food or atmosphere. I wish other businesses knew how to train their employees like this chain. I've been to celebration events in their reserved spare room. That room seats a lot of people. Whether a romantic meal, a family brunch/lunch/dinner or a celebration, can't go wrong at the ol' Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=360

We had to go up to them TWICE to see what was going on, and to our demise, we realized that they had lost our ticket(our place in line) so they had forgotten about us and had to find us another table.

Christine F.,"Northridge, CA",0,13,1,2.0,5/31/2015,"I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan, but this is going to be a bad review. This was my first time at the new location in the mall. We waited 45 minutes for a table - no problem, it's a Friday night so that's normal. Once we were seated the problems began. The waiter was friendly and polite, but he forgot to bring our drinks. I had to flag him down to remind him. He ran off and drinks arrived about 10 minutes later. Then, he offered us bread which he also forgot to bring. I had to ask again. It took about 20 minutes just to get bread! The food also took forever and my husband's steak was not cooked the way he asked for it but he was so hungry he just ate it. No way were we going to send anything back because we would never see it again. It doesn't end there. They left out one of my husband's side dishes saying they would bring it separately. As you probably guessed by now, another very long wait ensued.  I had to flag down a different waitress because our waiter was too busy talking too long with a group at another table. She said our waiter would bring it. By this time, my husband had finished his meal and got his potatoes separately at the end.  They obviously were extremely busy and understaffed, which is a management problem. I order a lot of food, drinks and I tip well but I expect good service and I didn't get it. What really annoyed me was that our server kept standing at another group's table chatting for way too long while we (and likely others) were being neglected. The servers need to learn how to manage overly chatty customers when they're in a time crunch. The ambience is also worth mentioning. The restaurant is beautifully designed and decorated but there is no escaping the cramped feeling at this location. The old location was far more open and roomy. We were in a booth that felt like those rollercoaster seats. The only thing missing was the belt.

I hadn't even known they had moved from Canoga, where, we had never encountered a problem. This, however, was possible my worst experience at a Cheesecake Factory ever and I frequent CF often, all across the country. We came for lunch around 12;30 on a Thursday. The wait was about 20 minutes, understandable. We were then seated all the way in the back, fine. Fine until we sat and sat and sat for a minimum of 15 minutes before anyone came to take a drink order let alone our food order. We both knew what we wanted before we sat down ('member frequent often). The waiter, who couldn't smile if his life depended on it, took our order and at least another 10 minutes passed before we got our drinks. They are in desperate need of an extra food/drink runner. My lunch companion then notified our waiter that there was gum under the table that was now stuck on her silk pants. His response ""what do you want me to do about it ? "", Oh, worst response ever! She asked for the manager who didn't come. The waiter finally returned and proceeded to scrap the gum off the table and give her a napkin for her pants.  The food took another 20 or so minutes. The food tasted good, as usual. Well, everything except the bread they bring, that was hard :( This was turning into the longest lunch ever and with no drink refills (until the check)!  My friend told the waiter the manager still had not stopped by. When he finally arrived he apologized and handed her a dry cleaners card. HA.

Minnie T.,"West Hills, CA",6,1,,2.0,8/16/2016,"My disappointed and annoyed experience at this Cheesecake Factory. We ordered two Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp to go. Which I was really looking forward to enjoying my food when we got home. Well that was a disappointment by itself. When we arrived home, I went  straight for the food. First let's start off with the presentation it look like they just threw it together rushing. This was the  lightest sauce  I've ever seen on the shrimp. Which was supposed to be blackened. Then unbeknownst to me they change the mango salsa to a pineapple salsa. Which was nasty. We didn't receive our Plantain. It was an epic fail !!! So I decided to give them a call to let them know how disappointed I was. I first asked, have there been any changes to the menu. The lady stated "" no not that I know of "". Ok when working in a restaurant, aren't you supposed to know about any changes when it comes to the menu. So I then asked to the Manager, which took forever. At leased she knew that there was a change in the salsa. End results getting gift card, but will not use it at that location. If I actually received them.

I asked the young man how long the wait would be & he said 5-10 minutes. We thought, ""sure, why not!"" & stuck around. 15 minutes had passed & we asked him how long the wait was & he said it would take another 5 minutes. Now, we aren't impatient or anything, but I mean, if you're going to estimate time during prime-time dinner hours, at least estimate it reasonably. He also had the audacity to say that only 5 minutes had passed. His manager even went up to him to tell him to inform customers that it would take 15-20 minutes to seat them, though he continued to say 5-10 minutes. Whatevs, not a big deal..but then. We we were seated outside - not outside outside, but outside ... as in the mall. I'm sorry, but we chose to eat at a restaurant & not the food court for a reason. Plus, our waiter was such a sassy frass. The food was great, or just the same as any other Cheesecake factory.

Mark W.,"ENCINO, CA",0,17,1,5.0,10/5/2013,"I give the Cheesecake Factory in Woodland Hills a solid 5 Star because it delivers, consistently, exactly what it advertises.  This can't be said of all other CF's that I have eaten (multiple times) in and quality/service/consistency do change across the different locations. Went that last week in September as my youngest daughter (8) picked this place to hold our family dinner for her birthday.  She always gets the Pasta Da Vinci with grilled chicken and the staff, as always, offer up a little song and a free chocolate a cream dessert for the birthday girl. I had the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampy combo - served with mashed potatoe and if you are a garlic lover, the shrimp in the garlic lemon sauce can not be beat. The Tex Mex egg rolls are a ""must have""  and so are the Buffalo Blasts - order extra ranch. There is always plenty of bread and butter, and we have never had any complaints with the wait staff or the wait times.  The place gets busy, if you are not prepared to wait for a table, go out of rush hour, it is simple as that. Also, we like the outside patio in at this location. I read someone who gives the just CF 3 stars because it is an ""Upscale Denny's"" and the that they, the reviewer believes they ""have a better understanding of good food"".   This person is missing the point, in my opinion.  If the CF was being compared to a Michelin starred restaurant (maybe $200 a head without drinks) then, yes, 3 stars would be applicable - but who in their right mind goes to the CF for a fine dining experience?  No one - it is loud, busy, full of kids and people in shorts and flip flops and serves big portions of fattening food - washed down with copious amounts of soda/beer/fruity cocktails. What they server and how they serve it is exactly what their patrons what from that particular dining experience - and that is worth of 5 Stars.

Barbara M.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,38,,2.0,1/2/2014,"Our beloved Cheesecake Factory recently moved from it's ""forever"" home on Canoga Avenue in Woodland Hills to it's new home at Topanga Mall in Canoga Park.  Although the new venue is more convenient to patrons and has more exposure I'm not sure they did themselves a favor.  The atmosphere is warm and exciting, as was the previous location.  The bar area seems to be the biggest hit.  It's not as large as the Canoga venue and neither is the restaurant.  The noise level is very high but, so was Canoga.  That said, we were there during the holidays and the joint was jumpin. Our experience was less than exciting. We waited over an hour, but that was OK.  The host text us on our cell phone when our table was ready and we were free to go about our day in the mall.  We are absolute peppermint bark junkies and when we read the sign on the entrance door, ""Peppermint Bark Cheesecake Is Back"", we were in for the take.   We are now seated and ordered.  Marco, our waiter was wonderful.  The food was not.  I had Renee's special lunch which is a cup of soup (cold), chicken salad sandwich (full of bones) and a salad, which was the best on the plate.  When we inquired about the Peppermint Bark Cheesecake, Marco, our waiter, laughed and said it had been off the menu over a week.  We were heart fallen. It was the reason we decided to have lunch here and wait over an hour, anticipating the cheesecake.   Jodie, one of the managers, was a prince.  He removed my entree from the bill and apologized for the lack of the peppermint cheesecake and gave us a complimentary cheesecake which was, of course, wonderful.  The service, even though they were ""slammed"" was better than expected.  We applaud the managers and wait staff for their attentiveness.  The food, however, may take some time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=460

There's virtually no room and if you're there on a sunny day, people like to take the umbrellas your using and give them to someone else without notice. It's happened twice to me unfortunately. The parking is a lot more difficult too since they've moved to the mall. I believe they do still offer valet, but I didn't see anyone at the time I pulled up.

But I had a gift card so I decided to go to this particular restaurant one day. Another reason I don't like going to Cheesecake Factory as much I used to is because on our table sat the booklet with all the nutritional information. I always knew it was high-calorie stuff, but seeing the actual numbers really depresses me. At the same time, I'm glad I can know the nutritional values because that led me to make a ""smarter"" choice. I ordered the Simply Grilled Salmon Lunch Special and my bf got the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak. We opted to sit out on dessert after looking at the nutritional values. Both the salmon and steak tasted pretty good, although the salmon wasn't nice and flaky enough. I liked the side salad that came with my salmon. Overall, this place wasn't bad.

Sherry M.,"Pasadena, CA",32,117,10,4.0,12/27/2013,"I really loved the old location next to the Hilton, and the fact that this Cheesecake is now at the mall means two things, 1) parking is even more of a headache 2) the wait is much longer, and the restaurant is smaller and more crowded.  Aside from that, the new location is beautiful, very modern, very classy, very new. Our server was Steven and he was fantastic, extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He suggested a few items for us, and even hung around to chat with us for a little, he was extremely welcoming. My friend and I shared the spinach and artichoke dip and the bbq chicken salad, and against his better judgement my friend ordered the 'mac and cheese glamburger' which he surprisingly enjoyed.  Everything was nice except for some not very friendly hostesses at the front, I think it's seriously important to have friendly and welcoming greeters, they are the first impression you get of a restaurant, and if I didn't know any better, I would have judged this place poorly based on a few teenage girls attitudes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=460

Anthony S.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",51,7,,1.0,4/12/2014,"Poor service/bad management:  Arrived at the Cheesecake Factory for dinner on 11 April.  Host took our name promptly and gave us a 40 min wait time (not bad for a Friday night).  After 50 min we receive a text telling us our table is ready.  We check in with the host and he tells us to wait a moment.  We move to the side awaiting a table.  10 minutes pass by and we've now witnessed 6 other groups get their seat.  I go to the group of employees and I ask who here has the time to take my party of two to a table.  They ask the name and take us over to a corner table towards the back of the restaurant facing Sears and Forever 21.  We sat on out door furniture as crowds poured off the escalator in front of us.  If that is the environment we were looking for we could have gone to the food court So I decide to make the best of it and roll with the rest of the evening.  Server comes over.  He was a nice enough guy and did not exceed nor fall below expectations. We place our order.  I choose the grande burrito.  No special instructions just the grand burrito.  Food comes over in a timely manner.  Take two bites and decide to cut it open since it seems like it's missing something.  To my surprise they forgot to put, what I consider the main ingredient, the meat (chicken) in the burrito.   I call the server over who offers to get me a new burrito.  I tell him at this point I'd rather just call it quits on the Cheesecake Factory.  He removes my plate and I wait while the gf enjoys her meal.   The manager comes over and says, ""sorry about your burrito."" I respond, ""not a big deal.""  And then he walks away.  I spent several years in the retail industry as a manager and the entertainment industry and wow does he lack what it takes to run a business.  I highly doubt I'd be back.  I'd rather spend 15-25 dollars a plate at a much better run organization.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=420

I have to say it was fantastic! Unfortunately I didn't get a picture because I drove into it and ruined the beautiful display. I would definitely order that salad again. It had garbanzo beans, quinoa, avocado, lettuce, radicchio, cherry tomatoes, beats and a variety of other things... and was topped with a tangy vinaigrette. Although my stomach was exploding halfway through the salad - because I was so stuffed - I continued to eat because it was so tasty.

Adam G.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,4,3,2.0,2/5/2014,"Normally, I have exemplary experiences at the Cheesecake Factory.  I'm not really sure why this particular visit was different, but here goes. We arrived and were told that the wait for a party of two would be around 45 minutes.  That was accurate.  Patience was rewarded by a long wait at the host stand-- though when the host seated us, she was friendly, full of smiles, and attentive.  Still a chance for remediation. Having been in the restaurant for nearly an hour already, standing and waiting for a table, we were primed for a drink.  The server arrived about 10 minutes after we were seated and asked what we'd like.  We ordered the drinks and an appetizer, and after another ten minutes they arrived. Water took another 10, give or take five minutes. This was shaping up to be a ""hurry up and wait"" experience.  Initially, I thought the server was in a fairly netural mood. We were given a generous TWENTY MINUTES to make our way through the three corn dogs and the drinks we ordered.  A busser came by after about 10 to remove the quickly-devoured appetizer, and the server helpfully stopped by to ask how they were-- but only that.  When she did return to take our meal order a while later, the tired drinks were almost finished and we were still every bit as ravenous as when we walked in the door.  The server herself looked more harassed then when we had arrived. The meals arrived after another decade, and I asked for a refill.  This refill came quite promptly, though my sister made the observation that her pasta appeared to have been sitting for a while due to the more solidified quality of her marinara sauce.  My meal of chicken marsala seemed fine to me.  Being hungry, we gave little thought to it, and began our meal-- nearing the two hour mark.   By the time we had finished eating, we had been at the restaurant for about two hours and were about ready to move on and continue our evening. The finished plates sat for awhile until the busser removed mine.  The server returned a short while later to ask if my sister wanted a box, which was promptly delivered.   The bill took ages. We sat.  And we waited.  And we waited more.  The server appeared- short, and seeming to be undergoing some sort of internal struggle- and left us to determine who owed what.  By the time the server reappeared to take the cards, we were beyond ready to go home, having missed the movie we were hoping to make.  Uncharacteristically, she reappeared within two minutes, and we were free to go. Truly unfortunate, really. All-told, we were at Cheesecake Factory for almost three hours.  Every other time I've been there-- and I mean EVERY-- the servers have been quick, courteous, timely, polite, and helpful... As befits a restaurant of its caliber.  I'm disappointed, and I can't help feeling that they're overwhelmed in some way- despite being at least as busy in their former location on Canoga.  I understand that servers are human and that they're every bit as capable of having a bad day as the rest of us.  However, the mood and the timeliness of the server reflects on the business which employs them, and my sister and I were as polite as we always are to people who interact with our food behind closed doors. I would recommend a field that doesn't involve customer liaison if unable to bear these things in mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=420

It's like going to Donovan's on crack!!! Not to bash Donovan's. But what is the angle here? You tell me Mr Factory. So that is my bizarre impression of this branch. Food - Couldn't really narrow it down from the hundreds of items on the menu, so I just went with the Cali cheesesteak and fries. I mean really...do you need to have a hundred or so food specials in a restaurant? Doesn't that take away from the quality and personalized attention? Just my thoughts here. Cheesesteak was bland, not seasoned. They just added onions, and green bell peppers to help enhance it, but a little salt and pepper would have been nice. Cherry cheesecake a la mode - Yum, at least there is some quality here. However, it was too rich and I couldn't finish it, but still pretty good. I totally forgot the cherries came straight from the can. Parking - Just park across the street where the old Circuit City used to be so you don't have to worry about valet service.

Gexcel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,13,,1.0,3/9/2015,I wad very dissapointed by my service here today. The food was good and everything seemed ok until we left the restaurant. I asked the hubby how much did he pay and realized we were over charged. A meal was added to our order. I went back to resolve the issue and both manager and waiter was non apologetic nor did they seem to care. I know that people make mistakes but this one seems fishy and when you make a mistake apologize and humble yourself. They said they reversed the charge but never gave me a receipt for the back charge because the manager says they don't do that. So after they make a mistake I am just suppose to say ok and leave. I left because there was no point in arguing.  I am just wondering if that meal was added to our bill by mistake then where is the meal? How come it never showed up to our table especially when other servers bring the food to your table??? There is something wrong here???  Last week a friend was telling me that his credit card number was stolen at cheesecake factory and normally I don't check my bill but now I will be doing it so diligently.especially after this experience and my friends experience.

The food is delicious (of course) and everyone I interacted with was super friendly and attentive... I had a wonderful dining experience. I showed up after a long day of shopping to grab a quick bite by myself (don't judge). The place was really busy but I was seated right away, shown to my table on the patio by a friendly gentleman, and was greeted by my server almost immediately. One of the servers noticed the table was a little wobbly so she came over with a rolled up napkin to place under the legs making it more stable. Thanks! The patio was a little chilly but somebody brought an extra heater out - problem solved.  I ordered the fried mac and cheese (so amazing, I get it almost every time). Unfortunately it was cold on the inside, almost as if it had come out of the fridge and wasn't cooked all the way through. I wouldn't have minded saving it for later but fried mac and cheese isn't really something you can reheat at home (and I was already satisfied by the flatbread I had orderd - also amazing), so I asked my server to kindly take it back. I was surprised that the manager came over to personally apologize for the cold food. He was so friendly and offered - no, insisted - to not only take care of the macaroni, but to send me home with a piece of cheesecake. They really went out of their way to fix a mistake and make my day! By the way, if you haven't had the tuxedo cheesecake yet then you're missing out. Even if you don't like cheesecake, you will devour this delicious piece of dessert. Thank you, management and staff, for a lovely experience - despite the cold food :) I will definitely be returning soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=480

BUT........ We were told 1/2 hour wait and waited an hour, I don't mind waiting, I do mind inaccurate estimates,unless of course they tell me a half hour and its only 15 min.  I witnessed the manager reprimanding an employee about a $10 shortage, in front of a room full of customers, I guess the guy doesn't know how loud his voice is. (Because its been tested, my hearing is pretty bad)  When we were finally seated, we had to wait, blocking a busy aisle, for them to finish cleaning the table.  The kids and I sat with the last guys chunks of bread at our feet, but I guess it was fine as long as you didn't look down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=480

Showed the manager and he didn't seem to see my complaint. Basically half the sandwich had NO chicken. He first said its pre-mixed, then he said it's weighed out. I had to slowly explain to him that it's a half sandwich and not a full. My friend ordered the same on different bread and the results were the same. Could of had a better one at Starbucks.

The spinach dip was great and the portion was enough for at least 6 people as an appetizer.  Calamari and the tarter sauce was also good. I would've liked a but more crispy but was still good.  Now, the stuffed mushrooms and avocado egg rolls were definitely not worth it. I have been to other locations as well as tried different chains version and this Topanga location failed. The avocado rolls were soggy and the avocado was quickly turning brown. Definitely much better at claim jumpers.

Nicole A.,"Los Angeles, CA",831,655,374,3.0,7/19/2015,"I'm not a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory in general. I think their menu options are overpriced and filled with empty calories. I came here with friends to grab dinner. I'd say the highlight of the dinner was the bread they bring to the table. That bread is so delicious, especially smeared with butter. I had ordered some chicken quesadilla dish which I found to be overly greasy. My pineapple mule was served in a tall glass instead of the traditional copper mug with tin lining. It was also overly sweet and seemed watered down. The service was good, our waiter was attentive but he was pushing the desserts way too hard. I don't know if I've ever had their cheesecake to be honest because I grew up in a very health-conscious family and since I suffer from my own health problems, I rarely indulge, but you gotta admit that their cheesecake flavors are impressive.

So we all agreed to wait in the hopes that we would be seated earlier mind you most of our party showed up 20 minutes early. While waiting for a table the restaurant was readily able to seat multiple parties of 7 and 6 and we found it very embarrassing that patrons of this place made comments like ""OMG they are still waiting?

Waiter/waitress makes frequent visits to ensure that the eating experience is well worth the time, trip, and money. Prices range from $10-20 but the dishes are large! One dish can feed two people. The menu labels the calories, which is great for people who are dieting. Their cheesecake is a bit pricey but well worth the price. My favorite would be the ultimate red velvet cheesecake.

Laarnii D.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/16/2016,"Bad customer service tonight. Just plainly disappointed that I got cream of chicken soup instead of the clam chowder that I ordered on the phone. The guys ask me what size of clam chowder I asked for a bowl. I got home and my husband was asking why theres no clams in the clam chowder. I called this location to inform and spoke to the manager steven and he said they dont have clam chowder today and that they have cream of chicken. I said I ordered clam chowder and whoever took the order did not say there is no clam chowder today. Steven repetead to me that they dont have clam chowder today! Wow what a manager. He did not offer any resolution right away for this mistake and he asked what do I want. I told him my kids are now eating and I cannot leave so maybe he can just put a clam chowder credit for me and Ill get it anytime. He said no I cant do it any other day only today because he is not there next Friday. Wow again! I am just very disappointed with the way this manager handles this very easy situation. He asked me what I want instead of offering a resolution, I dont really want to ask for anything else besides what I ordered and plus I dont want to go back. TodAy is a long day of swim competition and at 7pm this is our lunch (I ordered Hook Burgers for the kids), so really this manager's work ethic is very unprofessional.  If he said Im sorry for the misunderstanding let me credit you back the soup charge I would have been ok. But he kept on saying what do I want instead, I finally said just give me a salad (which I just ate salad last 2 nights thats why today I opted for soup). What an inconvenience!!!Now I have to go back to the store and get my salad instead of me resting already with my kids from a long day of activity.  I like the food no doubt but manager's ability to handle customer's is way below standards for a restaurant like cheesecake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=500

Hope the management team sees this and recognizes his efforts. He made an effort to check on us a number of times and all three of us left very impressed and pleased with him.

Andrew M.,"Berkeley, CA",16,90,,4.0,11/24/2012,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, if you've been to one you've been to all of them. The amazing thing is the consistency. Literally hundreds of dishes on the menu, granted a lot of them use the same ingredients, but it's surprising that one kitchen can turn all of this out so efficiently and consistently.  Also amazing? Not only that the kitchen can turn out hundreds of different dishes a night, but that most of them can actually be good. In a way The Cheesecake Factory is kind of the Styx or Abba of the culinary world. Nobody wants to pay them much respect but everyone still secretly likes them. Where else can you go for this kind of cheesy opulence and still get a consistently well cooked piece of salmon? Its the culinary version of a casino in Vegas, proud of how shallow it is, admitting that it's not really trying for any kind of authenticity in anything it does, but cranking out a polished simulacrum of the culture that it's trying to ape. Could I ever confuse the Venetian in Vegas for the canals of Venice? Never in a million years, but it has its own thing going on and that has value in its own right. Huge portions, larger than any human should be allowed to eat are served with flagrant disregard for calorie counts or actual nutritive value. Due to Los Angeles law, a separate sheet with calorie counts is brought out with your menu, but if you're coming here you really shouldn't even think about counting calories. Really, even if you do care about calories, you shouldn't look at this sheet, because it's just going to cause guilt and shame afterwards. Yes, your entree is going to be between 2100 and 3100 calories, so skip the appetizer. Really, I'd be shocked if you can have a couple of drinks, an entree and a dessert here and get out for under 4k calories.  The Skinnilicious menu doesn't have anything you'd actually want to eat on it so don't even look at it.  Really, The Cheesecake Factory straddles that line of ""I'm totally only enjoying this ironically"" and ""I'm actually totally enjoying this"" so well that it's best not to analyze it, and besides, does it actually matter? Either way you're having a good time. Most of the cheesecakes are too sweet though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=500

Wayne A.,"Canoga Park, CA",1,10,,4.0,4/13/2013,"If I want to go someplace and eat decadently, there's no place like The Cheese Cake Factory. You don't come here if you're on a diet (even if they do claim to have a ""skinny menu""). You come here because there's a menu the size of a small town's phone book with dishes that are measured in the thousands of calories. And really, that's not a bad thing, if done in moderation. When I was a kid, my father would yell if we went to a sit-down restaurant and I ordered a burger. The Cheesecake Factory has gotten me over this phobia because the burgers are so damn good. More importantly, they'll cook the burgers to order and this includes rare. Most sit-down burger places weenie out when you ask for a rare burger, but this place will serve it nice, pink and mooing. They'll even accommodate your need for meat, nothing but meat and just meat by serving it without the buns.  Of course, there's the cheesecake. Chances are, you'll want the cheesecake, but you'll never get to it because the meals are just so damn rich. My solution: eat the cheesecake first. You might get some weird looks when your cheesecake is followed by a burger or pasta, but hell, at least you know you came and ate the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=540
Steve T.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/1/2013,"Recently visited the topanga mall location, but I do miss the previous location as I celebrated my college graduation there, along with many of my families birthdays. This place is great for a group and they always seem to get our complicated orders right on the first time. There are no reservations from when I last checked, so the wait varies depending on the day. Hosts do their best to seat you as fast as possible, and there is a bar and lounge option as well. The cheesecakes and desserts on display can also keep you occupied during the wait time. I'd give 4.5 STARS if I could, because the only thing they need to improve is the birthday dessert that they give you. I got a cup of whipped cream and chocolate syrup with a candle in it. The place has the word ""cheesecake"" in it, I was only disappointed in that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=540

She offered to take something off of our bill, give us free dessert etc...We appreciated her offer so much.  But, sometimes I want folks to know that if someone is complaining, it's not just because they want a reduction in the bill.  It's because they want the owners/managers to know that something is wrong...  I want them to know...Because if it were my business, I'd want to know.  I suppose I still give them a two (instead of a three for the very cool female manager) because the guy really shouldn't be there.  He made our dining experience quite awful, and I can't imagine that we are the only people he impacts negatively.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=560

Michael N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/8/2014,"Went on a Sunday night. It was somewhat busy, but we did not mind waiting. They had us give our phone number and when our table would be ready, they would send a text -- which was a nice feature but poorly executed (read on for details). During this time we explored the connected mall, staying in shops that were close by. Once we got our text, we came right back within 2-3 minutes. I do not know if our table was given away in this 2-3 minutes, but after getting back they had us wait there for another 12 minutes which was extremely discouraging. Others also seemed to have the same fate of being called back and waiting on the side until the table was really ready since 4 others were called before us after we got back (they were there before us on the side), so I do not think it was just us. Food was fair at best, however I have always had great tasting meals at other Cheesecake Factory locations. So by comparison, it was poor for their standards. I had made a note to my date that the thrown together pasta she made previously was much better than the one she ordered. Service was fine, water was always filled. We did have a little over 10 minutes between the first time the waitress came to take our order and us saying, ""just another minute"", but I will not hold that against her since it was busy. Overall, I give a 1 star since I expected a good dinner out and the food really disappointed us and that is what I care about most with the review. In addition, the text saying our table was ready even though it was no where near being ready started our dining experience off poorly.

So, the tip is going during typically busy times of the day and receive the excellent service you can expect at Cheesecake Factory.

She then brought the food to our table and first mistake was the Renees sandwich. I had order with a side of soup and they brought it with salad instead. Then we asked for an extra plate so she went to grab a plate for us she came back as she was handing it to us she said ""oh this plate is dirty let me grab another one instead"". I appreciate that she paid attention and went to get a clean plate, but even then the plate shouldn't be dirty or at least check before you bring it out. Then the worst happened. As we were eating my sister spit her food out to discover a chewed gum in her salad. She was chewing someone else's GUM that was in our salad. I felt sick to my stomach. We had barely eaten anything from our order. Manager came apologized and said we wouldn't have to pay. But that was honestly not the point. That is just plain DISGUSTING!

Then I ask for a up of water for my son and as he is drinking it notices the cup is dirty with some ort of food stuck in the inside of his cup. Gross, I bring it to the attention of the waitress who apologizes and beings another water. I expressed my concern to her that it was my first time at this restaurant and now I am unsettled regarding the rest of my order. To her credit she told the manager who also came over to my table and apologized, but here is the kicker...He didn't offer me even a 10% discount, piece of free cheesecake...nothing. It seemed very disengenous and matter of fact. Heck when McDonalds messes up they give you a free hash brown or fries.

We won't ever get those again. Plus we waited,and waiting with a 2 yr old is not easy. Also ordered a scoop of ice cream for her & by the time it came to our table it was melted.

From that point I had to wait another 35 MINUTES for a booth. I was so hungry there was no point in leaving. When they finally sat us.

Andy L.,"Pacoima, CA",283,220,6,3.0,8/1/2014,"Just A-OK. Rarely go to Cheesecake Factory, food is decent, cheesecakes are delicious but everything is overly priced. Decided to come here with a friend for National Cheesecake Day. Had to take advantage of slices being half off.  Food: My friend went with the Kobe burger and I got the lunch portion factory meatloaf. Food came out in decent time, didn't feel long but I think the table that came in after us got their food before us, maybe they ordered first? The burger looked delicious, the patty looked juicy, really juicy and it soaked to the bun, not a fan of that though. Stole some fries from my friend, a little bland but was crunchy. It was my first time getting the meatloaf and it was delicious. It was the lunch portion but there was still a good amount of food. The meatloaf was very flavorful and had a little crunchy outside and a juicy inside. The mash potatoes was alright, nothing too special but the gravy gave it good flavoring, the veggies were delicious though, good contrast to the meatloaf. It was good and filing even without finishing everything, had to save room for cheesecake.  Decided to split a cheesecake because we were pretty full. Plenty of choices and couldn't decide, ended up going with the red velvet one. Took a while to come out. Also had a little confusion, server thought we got it to-go when we wanted it there. But got it fixed quickly. Huge slice, thought it was going to be small with the deal they were having, couldn't finish it between the two of us. Always didn't like the cheesecake here since it's way too sweet but the red velvet one was not too sweet. Also to add onto the overly priced items, the strawberry lemonade was about $5 for something that tasted like Minute Maid from a carton. With that price you can get a beer at most places and it would have probably tasted better. Service: Was really crowded, expected being it was around lunch time and it being Cheesecake day. I like that instead of a pager they ask for your phone number and will text you when it's your table is ready. Table took about half an hour like they said it was going to take. What sucked was that they sat us ""outside"" as in not in the restaurant but in the sectioned off area inside the mall. It's weird to be having a meal with people shopping walking buy. At least there were pretty big fake bushes to act as a wall. Server was a little slow with things, didn't check up that often especially when we needed a drink refill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=520

Shannon D.,"Simi Valley, CA",15,48,6,1.0,8/26/2011,"I'll start by saying, that I used to be a regular at the TO location, prior to moving to Woodland Hills. The past two times I have been in to this location, I have been under impressed. The first time, our server was incredibly busy; therefore, she was unable to provide us with good service. My friends and I understand that this happens, as we are all servers ourselves. When our baked potato soup arrived it was cold, so we had to send three bowls back, to get hot fresh ones. By the time we left, we thought we had received bad service, but she was polite and very sweet, and we knew she overwhelmed so we let it slide. Last night, on the other hand, was a complete joke. I went for happy hour with two friends. We sat at a cocktail table, and received horrrible service. Our server had a total of three tables, including us, so I know she wasn't that busy. She took forever to take our order! At one point o ordered a second drink, and it took ten minutes to get to the table! My sister and boyfriend came late to join us, she saw them, and never offered them drinks or anything. There was also a point where there was only one out of five of us that had any beverage left in their glass. When our food came, after waiting a couple minutes, I had to get up and ask the hostess for silverware. It was truly awful. I was so bent out of shape, I could hardly enjoy the time with my friends. The food was what we expected, aside from the burnt chips that accompanied our guacamole. The gauc was tasty, as were the buffalo blasts, and potstickers. The happy hour pricing is def worth checking out. Only $5 for a variety of different apps, all of which are huge.  As much as I love Cheesecake Factory, not sure that I'll return to this location. I'd rather drive 15 minutes to Thousand Oaks, where I know I will receive good service and an enjoyable experience. Edit: Third bad experience in a row. Three of my friends and I waited ten minutes, and were never greeted. My friend went up to the host stand and asked if we could be moved to the patio, where we sat another ten minutes without being greeted. My friend went and spoke to the manager, who took our drink order. It took us another ten minutes to get our bar drinks. So a total of 30 minutes for us to get drinks and place our order. OUTRAGEOUS.

Today, I came here for lunch and to watch the Giants play the Eagles in the bar area after church service. My buddy and I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Salad to split.  Now I used to order this plate all the time and it used to be HUGE!  They used to serve a large  mound of salad that I could never finish in one setting even sharing it.  Now, that's all changed.  We specifically ordered the dinner size and not the lunch size but what we got seemed something closer to a lunch size as it seemed unusually small. They also used to add these thicker cuts of tortilla strips but have changed it to these tortilla chip strings which tasted stale on our salad.  There was also very little chicken in the salad like there used to be. The bread we were served was stale and the butter was also so hard that it was difficult to spread over the bread. Also, our waiter was constantly going over to talk to a female diner at the next table.  We even had to flag him down for the check even after he had taken away our dirty dishes and asked us if we wanted dessert to which we declined.  He then brought back our change with the coinage part missing.  That was pretty presumptuous to not give us our full change back.  It was only 39 cents, but who does that? If they're trying to increase their bottom line, they FAIL!  Although, it could just be this particular location has a problem and skimps on salads since it's happened 3 times now.   Come on Cheesecake, get your act together!  Don't think I'll go out of the way to return back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=620

We went in around 5ish and it wasn't busy AT ALL. We were sweated right away and ordered a salad as an appetizer.  Boy it took forever to come out.  At least 15-20 minutes, and to make it worse, it didn't come until 2 minutes before the entree, which defeated the purpose of ordering it. As for the entree, I ordered a steak, medium well. It came well done. We didn't see our waiter in any reasonable amount of time to even give me a chance to let him know it wasn't cooked properly, so I chose to eat it instead of having to wait even longer for a new order to come out.  We actually didn't see our waiter again after he first brought us the food, until we were done eating. That's when he chose to come by and see ""how everything was"". My drink glass sat empty for half my meal and he never did offer a refill. This is the second time in 3 visits I've experienced this type of service at a local Cheesecake Factory. Food cooked wrong, long wait to get food, poor waiter service. This was sub par food and even worse service.  Dunno if I've just had a string of bad luck at Cheesecake Factory, or if the quality of employees has diminished.  Either way, I leave disappointed, again.  Doubt I'll be returning to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=620

Samantha Q.,"Winnetka, CA",197,149,4,4.0,12/30/2010,New Year's Eve'ish lunch provided by work. A very nice gesture to ring in the new year.  I'm not sure what I got by looking at it. I recognized the staples like the delectable mashed potato's. Made with red skinned potatoes that were very nice and flavorful. There was also a large and fluffy biscuit that was nice and light. The only thing I couldn't name was the actual main course. It was like someone gutted a chicken pot pie. VIOLENTLY gutted a chicken pit pie. I'm not saying it was bad at all but the presentation left much to be desired.  The one thing that I would have loved to try was one of their many cheesecakes. It's crazy that I've eaten here an number of times and yet I've still never had any cheesecake... It's ironic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=620

We waited an inordinate amount of time for simple salads and sandwiches. Our order came out all wrong and the hot items were cold. We had to ask for a manager several times before one came to discuss our concerns. The manager was not equipped to accommodate the situation and our hour and a half fiasco was an extreme waste of time and money. Will not return!

David V.,"Huntington Park, CA",104,20,4,4.0,2/15/2011,"Last night I went to the Cheesecake Factory with my GF for valentines day. She was craving :P anyways first off let me talk about the service. I want to say it was good, but not great. When we first got there, and I got my pager to be called, they told me it would be about a 20 minute wait. to my surprise the pager went off in about 2 minutes, as we were looking for a place to sit at the bar. I figured something mustve opened up quick. I went to the front desk, and they took my pager, and then started calling out someones name, that wasnt mine. Luckily the manager was there and hashed it all out. He apologized, and gave us a new pager, and said that theyd try to get is in faster. Good customer service on his part. We sat at the bar, and bought a couple of drinks, and I have to say the Pomegranate Mojito is REALLY great, although if your a fan of the original Mojito, you might not like this one, because its much sweeter then any regular mojito.  We got to our table in about 20 minutes...so much for being seated faster, but at least it wasnt longer than that, and thankfully the pager snafu, didnt cause them to forget about us alltogether. We got to our table and were given our menus be the hostess, however, we werent tended to, until about 5 minutes later (i believe it was 5 but it felt a bit longer actually), by a waitress. She said ""hi im so and so, ill be helping so and so."" Unfortunately, no one else had tended to us prior to her, showing up, so I was a bit taken aback when she said shed be helping another person which i assumed we should have known about...and all i could say was... ""oook? thanks."" I also noticed most of the tables had bread as a starter. When the waitress first came up to us, she did not offer us any, until the second time she came back. That was also the time at which she took our order. I believe the amount of time between her first visit when she introduced herself and her second, was roughly 10 minutes. Thankfully, though, she was very knowledgable about the dishes, and offered her opinion, and we were also served very quickly. At the end of the night, she offered to box up our leftovers, and graciously asked us if we required validation for the parking. Not knowing, that validation was necessary or available here at their establishment, her suggestion was a nice surprise, in our favor of course, since we did not have to pay for parking :) All in all service was very good, but could be better, thats why i give them 4 stars and not 5.

My noodles always tend to be on the mushier side and it's always a bit more bland than what I'm anticipating. Chicken pasta with sun dried tomatoes: 2 parts I expect: creamy sauce with hunks of sun dried tomatoes, juicy chicken and tons of cheese and garlicy nom nom nomness, with forkfuls of delicious al dente pasta that just absorbs all of that deliciousness!!! What I get: not enough sauce and mushy pasta. Bistro Shrimp Pasta: the sauce had just a tad too much lemon for me. I've had lemon cream sauces before and normally I LOVE THEM, but this one not so much. The tomatoes and spinach (I think) added a nice brightness to the dish in contrast with the heavy sauce. I didn't like the shrimp that much because it wasn't crispy enough for me. The shrimp was fried, but it came out rather mushy looking. The sauce made it mushy obviously, but if its made fresh it should still retain a bit of crunchy at the beginning.  *** I also wish that I had room for cheesecake in the end. :( but I always get too full. sigh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=620

But I do love being able to read the nutritional values now.  My favorites? Boston House salad (appetizer size is plenty) Chicken Madeira Crusted Chicken Romano Louisiana styled pasta Farfalle with peas  Personally, the cheesecakes for which they are famous aren't good.

Isn't she paying attention? We pointed out her error that there were 3 of us. We were found a table that seats all of us but I asked if it was possible if we could have a booth instead. There were several open booth but instead she said that we would have to go back to the front desk and ask the lady if we could switch table. Huh??? Luckily a waiter passing by intervened and said that yes they could seat us in a booth (which was just right across our table). He was our waiter for the rest of the evening and he made our dining experience much more pleasant. Our waiter was very attentive to our needs without being overbearing.

Iza P.,"Atlanta, GA",198,271,398,3.0,5/11/2009,"Saturday night.  Family couldn't decide...so we went to Cheesecake Factory. Sure it was busy....that was to be expected, but first of all, don't buzz us to get seated to only have us to wait 5 more minutes to get seated.   The purpose of the buzz is to let us know that our table is ready, not that we should prepare to be seated. The waitress was really nice, but I guess due to the how busy it was, we were placed in this extra room that perhaps they don't  normally open up, and if they do, it's cause they are packed or it's for private parties.  I really thought I was sitting in some  kind of cafeteria and that we were definitely away from the actual restautant scene. Despite that though, my Shrimp Scampi (my usual for Cheesecake Factory) was good and I even liked how they didn't pile on too much pasta...as I neer really finish it.  Even before the entries, I thought their selection of ""snacks & mini plates"" was excellent. Because we were starving, we had the stuffed mushrooms, crisphy artichoke hearts, and corn fritters to start.  For an average of $5 per mini plate, these dishes were the perfect portion for 4 people and a great price.  Sure beats your usual overpriced appetizers. Because they are definitely a chain, this particular location was ok.  Wouldn't say I'm a fan, because I think I prefer the one in Cambridge Mass the best....however, I have not been there for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=660

I really hope I don't get sick, not to mention I had a toddler with me that wanted to grab my food. Luckily she didn't get any of my salad. I mean really? Check your meat before sending it out.

nicole r.,"Granada Hills, CA",124,101,16,3.0,3/10/2011,"Walking in we were greeted, and escorted through a seamingly semi-empty restraunt where the hostess tried to seat my father and I at table/booth the size of fish tank. While surrounded by dozens of empty tables. When asked to be seated somewhere else the hostess awkwardly looked around and said ""uuuuuuuuuh, sure okay"".... Sat us a more comfortable table and walked away.  Our waitress came by a couple minutes later to take our drink order, which she did and then quickly walked away. Our drinks took a while to come and when she put them down it was if she was about to run away again, while both me and my dad had questions/were ready to order. I had to ask for a dish recommendation because  trying to read the entire 20 something page menu is dizzying.  She told me to get the lemon herb chicken with mashed potatoes and carrots. Okay.  So again she scurries away we sat for about 20 minutes or so before the food came or before anyone came to check on us at all for that matter. :( And once the food did arrive we were again not visited until we had to ask for the check.  Suffice the O.K. service the food is always good. Not OMNOMNOMNOMNOM SO DELICIOUS GUNNA DIE OF DELICIOUS OVERDOSE!!!!!!! but good, stick to your ribs (and your gut) food. I like that the portions are gigantic, not because I feel like it justifies paying 20$ for a 10$ meal but because for 20$ you get to eat for 3 days!!!! Or you can share plates with friends, which I like the most. Yum.  Being inside of this cheesecake factory makes me feel like I'm on  a bad date-business meeting. I feel like the insides are all outdated and weird looking. There are murals all over the place that would appeal to middle-aged cat ladies. Just weird. It was not comforting and relaxing.

Dined for the first - and possibly the last - time at the new Cheesecake Factory in the Topanga Mall. I was very surprised at how large the restaurant was, especially since we were seated at the faaaar end of the restaurant. While the food was ok, the real disappointment was the air conditioning. The temperature was uncomfortably cold. We complained to our server, who said that there was nothing that could be done; all of the tables in the back part of the restaurant are always cold. At the end of our meal, we asked to speak with the manager. We told him about the cold air and he was very defensive, bordering on rude. He basically said that there was nothing that CF could - or would - do to remedy the situation.

Fast forward 15 minutes and still no attention shown and not even a mere drink order has been taken yet. I'm becoming extremely confused as I see all these waiters (a team of about 8) all standing congregated at the register looking lost. I finally get a waitress who asks us for a drink order when I let her know we wanted to order everything as I was already fearing I would not see her again/ Extremely rarely. She took our order and another 20 min go by and we STILL do NOT have drinks yet(don't even get me started on the bread) which never came until the meal after telling the manager about my horrid experience. His excuse is that ""they do NOT serve bread UNLESS asked for prior? ALSO... We had the pleasure of using the DIRTIEST FILTHY SILVERWARE AND plates I have ever seen. They were super greasy and had food particles all over them YUCKY!!! I have been to Cheesecake Factory a minimum of 100 times and have not once been told that once. As for the excuse/perfect reasoning for the drink tardee/ absence was that one person in our party got a coffee in which they had to make is the reason. BUT... This is malarchy because I personally was a Barista at the coffee bean before and know exactly how long it should take to make a simple espresso. About 15 whole seconds for the shot to pour and to tamp/ prep the shot of espresso and to add sugar maybe another 15 seconds ? 15 minutes is NO EXCUSE and the manager was EXTREMELY unhelpful and was FULL of excuses trying to scape goat his way out of any fault that was rightfully his. The main coarse and appetizers came out at the same time therefore my avocado eggrolls were cold as ice and undercooked.. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AVOID THIS SPECIFIC LOCATION!

I've had two of the worst experiences I've ever had not just as a restaurant-goer but as a consumer at this place. One: While waiting for our table, we went to the bar section and ordered wine - but it never came, even though we reminded the bar waiter twice. When we were called to our table, the bar waiter actually demanded that we pay our tab! For wine we never got! Then the hostess tried to seat us at a table that another couple was waiting for and the other couple actually pushed us out of the way, sat down and then told us to get away from them while I tried to explain to the hostess that she needed to call the manager. When we went back to the reception area, I explained to a manager there about the indignities we had just suffered. I kept waiting for her to say: ""Sir, OK, let us get you seated and you'll enjoy a dinner on the house tonight."" But nothing. So I let a few years pass before I returned.  Two: When I did, the crowd was so thick and loud in the waiting area we couldn't hear what the host was telling us about the wait times so we left immediately.  Not to mention the completely unsatisfactory parking arrangement: either valet with long wait times for car pick up or go to the garage and walk five minutes from your car to the front of the restaurant, then negotiate the robot pay station on the way back to your car.

Laura D.,"Northridge, CA",30,47,1,1.0,9/18/2010,"First off, when my boyfriend and I arrived here on a Friday evening, it was too noisy to even enjoy our meal. We opted on take-out since we like to hear each other speak while we share dinner together lol.  I ordered the Chicken Marsala and Gabe had the salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. He complained his fillet was too ""fishy tasting"" for salmon - probably because it was not fresh. He also said his asparagus tips were overcooked and therefore mushy. He even said his potatoes were not thoroughly cooked.  As for the Chicken Marsala - the chicken was rubbery, the sauce tasted like straight up soy sauce, and the bow  tie pasta it was served on was undercooked.  Please read my other reviews and you will note I hardly ever mention cuisine. I only do so if it is bad or a rip off. We felt cheated after this meal...$50 and the best part was the appetizer bread! Cheesecake Factory may have been nice in it's hay day, but it is overpriced for food comparable to that of Chili's.  Oh and parking SUCKS. My boyfriend drives a Dodge 2500 and it was too large to fit in the parking structure so we had to park across the street and down the block. Save your money and go into the city.

Phil L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",37,41,3,3.0,5/11/2010,"Pretty much average in most ways. It's a chain restaurant, so I don't expect it to be awesome, but it is decent and there are worse options. Some dishes are quite tasty, even if they'll have you in cardiac arrest after eating them. The Chicken Madiera is one of their popular dishes that I enjoy, although I never understand why they make the mashed potatoes chunky. Does anyone like chunky mashed potatoes? My wife enjoys the shrimp scampi. We don't go often enough to deviate from our ""safe"" dishes, except the last time I went when I had a mad craving for Hawaiian Pizza. Big mistake. Undercooked, cold and soggy. How the heck do you mess up Hawaiian Pizza? Anyway, that'll be the last time I stray from my tried and true dish. Cheesecakes are good if you have a sweet tooth. I prefer mine slightly toned down on the sugar, but my wife and brother really enjoy them so I'd assume most people would like them just the way they are. Like most chain restaurants, service is all over the map. Wait time for dinner is usually pretty ridiculous - like 45-60 minutes. Garage parking in the back is pretty easy and it's free if you get validation.

The first time I actually enjoyed the food I ordered a cheeseburger. It was GREAT.  After that I gave it a couple more tries - I ordered the shepherd's pie which was okay... maybe good, but not really notable. Then the last time I was there I got a cheeseburger with pork belly... again DELICIOUS.

girlie g.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,32,2,1.0,5/10/2015,"Let me make it clear, the food here is always consistently good, however my review is about the inconsistency in policies and service. I came into this location and was told by the reception that the entire bar area was a ""seat yourself"" section. Okay cool, we sit down and immediately a waitress throws us out saying we could not seat ourselves on the low tables in the bar area...okkkaaaay...so we wait no problem I guess it's only bar top or high top tables that are this way...then when I returned I tried to put my name in for those tables in the bar area (so I could take advantage of their happy hour) and AGAIN the reception tells me it's a seat yourself section. I said ""no I fell for that the last time and was kicked out"" and then she walked me over there and sat me insisting it was a seat yourself section and sure enough we got served no problem, cool. Cut to today when I came in and asked the reception if the bar area was available for seat yourself and they said  ""yes it's always seat yourself"". Great! So we head over and sit down, within seconds a rude male waiter comes over and throws us out and shamed us to boot. I said ""sir the reception informed us it was okay and the last time I came it was the policy, has it changed once again?"" And he snipped at me and said "" these tables have never been seat yourself you will have to wait for a reservation if you ever want to sit in this section that's our policy"" and then took off. wow I'm sorry I don't work here and therefor rely on the information i get from the staff on where I can sit and when I can sit and it's always conflicting and inconsistent. Not to mention the waiter did not have to be so rude about it.  I wasn't trying to cheat the line or whatever I was told I could sit here and actually have before. The whole ordeal is upsetting I really think they need to be clear about their policies and make sure all of there staff are on the same page.

Our waitress was extremely friendly although our food did take quite a while.. for just two salads?? The bbq ranch chicken salad was lacking in onion rings, although I had requested more. A nice young lady offered me more while stating that they were working on a fresh batch at the moment.. does that mean that my onion rings were old?? gross.. anyway I had replaced them with the generous side that she had brought me. As we were leaving I had saw a manager scolding a staff member in front of guests.. unaware of why she was getting whipped into shape, I believed it was a little over the top especially in such a public area.

Jarrod M.,"San Diego, CA",18,43,3,3.0,3/11/2012,"While I really like Cheesecake, I have definitely had better experiences. This particular location is very popular and being located in a corporate area like Warner Center, a lot of professionals frequent this restaurant. Parking is not as convenient as it would be if this were a stand alone location, but that's not really the restaurant's fault. The lobby is enormous, as is the rest of this location. As is the Cheesecake custom, they have the desserts staring at you from behind the brightly lit display cases just as you come in. Getting to your table can be a trek, due to the shear size of this place. They certainly pack the tables close together, which, unless you get a booth, makes you feel as if you are sharing a meal with other diners next to you. I have always found the tables themselves far too small for all the stuff they try to cram on there- silverware, glasses, bread basket, bread plates, etc.  This particular trip was not the greatest due to our lack of a server for the first 10 or so minutes after we sat down. When our server finally did arrive, though, he was pleasant and attentive enough. Our food took a while also, which I can understand due to how busy it was. The food itself is always good and portion sizes are more than adequate. When we were ready for our bill, we had to wait again to see our server for a while. I normally try not to rate too harshly on one element alone, but this time, I just didn't enjoy it as much because of the extremely slow service.

I tried deviating from the normal pasta option that I usually get and ordered the chicken madeira.  It's one of their signature dishes.  It's chicken breast slightly glazed in cheese that comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus dipped in a teriyaki-like sauce.    You have to order their banana creme cheesecake.  It's pretty light in terms of flavoring, as it is not too sweet nor too bland.  It tastes soo good.

I have tried all dishes and many of deserts. now after couple of years I came back to this location and its still the same great cheesecake factory as it always used to be. food is great, it is a bit loud, but thats how it always is. if youre looking for quite restaurant this is not it. their coctails are fantastic, food delicious and deserts are phenomenal! and they do validate the parking for 2 hours. (someone in one review said they did not validate, but they do) great place to go and hang out in the evening, watch a basketball games, have a dinner maybe a drink and chill with your spouse with some class ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=720
Joelle G.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,55,,4.0,8/11/2009,"I know it's a chain, and I know the wait is sometimes unbearable, and I know their portions are made for some giant of a human, and therefore I'm supposed to despise this place - but I hate to admit it, I'm a huge fan.  The Woodland Hills location seems to be the best of the cheescake factory's in terms of service and wait-time. I honestly have never had to wait longer than 20 mins - big groups and small parties alike. Plus, all the servers really seem to be on top of their game, and I've never had a complaint.  Another reason I love the cheesecake factory - does it get any better in terms of variety? I mean seriously, anything you want to order is on the menu. It can be a bit overwhelming at times, but even the pickiest of eaters can find something here. My surefire bet: The BBQ Chicken salad. It's never led me astray. And, it's so big it's like getting 2 meals in one.  So, I'm sorry Cheesecake Factory haters - I know I'm supposed to despise your big corporation ways, but you're just so delicious and accommodating :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=720
Angelina M.,"Glendale, CA",27,35,,3.0,1/26/2012,"I dine here last night with a friend. The service was OK - our waiter seemed a little confused. Instead of red wine, I got white wine, instead of brown rice - white rice (even though we specified brown)... And at the end of the meal he asked us if we wanted to box the left-overs, we said ""yes"", he disappear for 15 min, then came out again and asked the same question. Perhaps he was overwhelmed, because it was a busy night. Food: Avocado rolls - 5 stars! Beets and goad cheese salad would benefit from more beets, there were just a few small cubes... Ahi tuna (I ordered it as a main course, not appetizer) was supposed to be accompanied with wasabi sauce, so I expected it to be a little spicy and flavorful. However, the fish was bland and the amount of sauce, sprinkled around it was so miniscule, that it wasn't enough to add flavor to the dish. My recommendation is - add more sauce or marinade the fish in something that has a taste.  Overall experience - good, but needs improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=720

My 2nd hot piece of ass outing...  I craved a wrap but no dice.  Even on the expansive menu there was no wrap.  I decided on the Blackened Chicken Sandwich.  It was very flavorful, but...  The bottom piece of bread was wet with...  I don't know with what but if it weren't for my hot piece of ass friend I'd have asked for another sandwich.  Lucky server, who was only mediocre.  For dessert...  I tried the Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake and it was a good ending for my meal.

Also not their fault but there was construction going on and trees were being cut down. It was very loud and unpleasant outside. Not their fault though.

For a restaurant with the word ""cake"" in its name you'd expect to be served a decent slice of chocolate blackout, but I'm sorry to report otherwise. My wife and I stopped in to pick up some dessert to go on the way home from the movies, and we had specifically requested to NOT be served one of the oxidized slices from the display case. I have many years of restaurant experience as a server, so I know the difference, and I would never serve a customer something that I wouldn't serve to my own mother, but apparently the staff at the Cheesecake Factory are either orphans or just don't care, because one side of the $7 slice of cake was oxidized to the hardness of shoe leather.

I have a hard time keeping track of how many times they have forgotten a part of my order, taken a half hour after I arrive to pick up, and they've already had a half hour to prepare my food, or just plainly forgotten about me. I have gotten plenty of free cheesecake from it, let me tell you, but it's not really worth the hassel.  The food, on the other hand, is typically superb. I always share because the portions must have been designed by a fifteen foot giant. My lady got me a slice of their choclate cheesecake peanutbutter cookie dough extravaganza last night, and I couldn't stop eating it! It's a slice of chocolate cheesecake, sandwiched inbetween a bottom layer of oreo cookie crust and a top layer of chocolate fudge. There are chunks of chocolate and peanuts dispersed throughout the cheesecake itself. Then the whole thing is topped with a GIANT swirl of peanutbutter cookie dough, and sided with a huge serving of whipped cream! WOW. It was so decadent and exactly what I needed.

David O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",127,1284,937,3.0,11/6/2006,"This Cheesecake Factory is embedded discreetly into the facade of a Hilton hotel off of Canoga Park near Erwin.   In fact, unless you're looking for it, you probably won't find it.   Then again, what do I know?  By the time we left this place, a couple of hundred people had ""found"" it and duels were held in front of the restaurant to try and boost your name on the waiting list.   Man I hope that poor Dutch father of 4 doesn't have to work with his hands, because he'll be on disability for quite a while and I don't really think hands grow back.   Ok, sorry... joking, joking.   Let's just say we were fortunate enough to walk in here at 11:15 AM and we sat at a prime location at the bar and watched the second half of the game (Can you believe Dallas missed that field goal?!?!?)  By the time we left at 1 PM, there were about 50 people waiting nervously around the door, hoping that the dining patrons would throw them scraps while they waited. My wife's worked in restaurants: high end Napa Valley joints that get 2 or 3 Michelin stars.  This is to say she sees things in restaurants the rest of us mere mortals have no idea about.   She said that the bar was seriously understaffed and they were doing a great job.   This was in reply to my statement:  ""WTF??!  We've been here 10 minutes... why is the service so lousy?""   She spotted the number of waitresses, was able to determine that one of these waitresses was working both the bar and the restaurant, and said that the GM was even getting involved....  all observations that quite clearly went straight over my head, since I was merely concerned with getting my beer.   All this to say that the service was actually pretty good, considering the shortage of staff.  In other words, the waitresses worked their butts off and did a fabulous job, but they need to hire themselves some more people. Food was good.   We shared an appetizer of buffalo blasts and we also shared a chopped salad.   I then ordered the Grilled Cheese sandwich and my wife had the Kobe burger.   Hmmm.... I actually thought we ordered pretty well.  Yeah well apparently I'd forgotten all about Cheesecake Factory's Supersize Plus (tm) portions.   That food ended up being enough for both brunch (when we were there) *AND* dinner 8 hours later.   The portions are insanely huge!  Note, however, that the food was not nearly as good 8 hours later, so it doesn't hold very well if you take it home. My wife said that once I'd taste the buffalo blasts, I'd be hooked.   Well, I'm not, but I don't think they were that good, and she indeed concurred.  She said that the outside is typically crispy and convenient to dip in either the buffalo sauce, the blue cheese sauce, or both.  The appetizers we got were pretty much on the soggy side.   They tasted yummy and all, but they didn't blow me away or anything. The chopped salad was huge, but I wasn't impressed.   I, for one, am of the opinion that chopped salad needs a creamy style dressing like ranch or blue cheese.  The dressing here was this italian vinaigrette... I dunno, it didn't really do it for me. The grilled cheese sandwich was also huge.   I mean I thought a grilled cheese was a safe bet.  Basically you picture wonder bread, or any loaf of bread for that matter... let's say you get a mental picture of the bread aisle.  A slice of bread is a slice of bread is a slice of bread.   Well, no, not so much apparently....  The toast used for my grilled cheese sandwich must have the same trainer as Barry Bonds, because that was just the biggest slice of toast this side of the Mississippi.   Anyway, it was good. Drinks... ok.   I got a Stella on tap, so you really can't mess that up.  I had a Bloody Mary to start things off, and that was only so-so. Would I come back?  Yeah definitely.

Ryan R.,"Northridge, CA",36,10,23,5.0,4/20/2009,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory.  What started as a small cheesecake operation in the 1970's has grown into a full restaurant and bar with a huge menu of fantastic food with great interior design.  Each location has a character of it's own.  Some locations are ""Cafe's"" which are a bit smaller.  Brentwood has low ceilings and low lighting which feels more like a fine dining establishment, with a great patio with fountain.  Others like Woodland Hills have large dining areas with huge vaulted ceilings.  No two are alike. I worked as a waiter for The Cheesecake Factory for a couple years in the late 90's.  This experience sparked my interest in the culinary arts.  All the waiters have to know the menu production protocols quite well.    Another interesting bit of information is that The Cheesecake Factory management structure is a ""reverse pyramid"". Instead of the waiters being peons at the bottom of the internal food chain, with the management at the top - the waiters are at the very top of the pyramid - the most valued employees in the company.  The management is there below you - whose function it is  to support you in any way they can.  I loved this.  I have a deep respect for the way The Cheesecake Factory does things and treats their employees.   They value their employees more than any company I have ever worked for. Almost everything on this huge menu is bound to impress.  Very high quality ingredients, huge portions, and great tasting recipes - which are highly guarded by the way.  You must try the avocado egg-rolls which are outright shockingly good.  If you don't love these things, there is something wrong with you!  Avocado, sun-dried tomatoes & cilantro rolled in a wanton wrapper, fried, cut on the bias and served with a deliciously sweet tamarind dipping sauce.  Yummo!  Other good apps to try after you've done the avocado rolls are the Sweet Corn Cake Tamales and the Tex Mex Egg-rolls.  The Santa Fe Salad is amazing and is a must try too.  The BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad comes in a close second.  I have yet to be disappointed with any entree on the menu.   The Chicken Madeira is a solid choice if you can't decide.  Everyone likes it!  The mashed potatoes are the best you will ever have - made from new potatoes, heavy cream, butter and salt.  Heavenly.  One of may favs is the California Cheesesteak Sandwich, served with a side of marinara for dipping.   For steak lovers, I recommend the Filet cooked rare to medium rare with shoe string fries.  Ask to top the steak with a dollop of steak butter (the coulotte steak butter or the cajun butter). It used to come standard with cajun butter, yet they don't do this anymore. They still have the butter as they use it in other recipes.  The butter really makes it something special.  If you like a garlic kick, go cajun - otherwise get the coulotte butter.  If you're going to eat a steak, here or anywhere for that matter, it must be finished with butter, trust me,   It's a culinary tradition dating way back.   This place is not the place to go to cut calories.  It's a special place to go to treat yourself now and then.  Sunday brunch offers additional menu items.  It's fun to eat on the patio Sunday mornings.   Cheesecake here is the best you'll find, and the selection is gargantuan.  It's also fun to dine here just for dessert.  A girlfriend of mine used to insist on picking up a slice of cheesecake to go on our way home after being out for the evening.  The very best cheesecake on the menu is the Godiva cheesecake.  Get it!  Eat it!  Put it in your belly and the bellies of your loved ones!  Trust me!   This place rules.  If you are unhappy, tell them and they will take good care of you.  They highly value you as a guest.   Great food, great drinks and a great dining environment.

Parking is no problem if you use the valet service if not you have to park in the garage in the back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=800
Mortimer M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,53,,3.0,8/28/2008,"I liked my experience here at this Cheesecake Factory. Kind of crowded. Parking is confusing. Food was good, not great. Service was good. Too expensive for my taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=800
Sue L.,"Simi Valley, CA",268,479,25,3.0,5/22/2010,three to four stars. service wasnt the best. had a hard time getting the waiter. took him awhile to finally get us our bill.  i had the tostada salad. wasnt bad. wasnt the greatest either. it was absolutely huge. it can easily feed two to three people. the tostada shell was definitely overcooked. it was a tan color. the dark bread is outstanding. the cheesecake was great. i am a dulce de leche /caramel fan. i had the dulce de leche cheesecake. they overdid it with the whip cream. otherwise really nice. everyone else at the table  enjoyed their meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=800
Daniel H.,"Canoga Park, CA",202,57,42,1.0,3/26/2008,"We often come to Cheesecake Factory, just not this location. This has to be the worst Cheesecake Factory in every way possible.. Slow non existing service, with terrible food. So my mother and sisters started off with a couple drinks at the bar. Once our table was ready they said they would send the bar tab to our table. After them having sent our tab to the table my mom was holding it and the waiter had the nerve just to snatch it out of her hand and say, ""what are you doing with that?""  my mother replied, ""it's our bar tab"" the waiter replied with a, ""yeah.. sure it is."" he then grabbed it and just ran off. After waiting 45 min for the food to arrive, we tried to enjoy the dry meal. When the regular bill came we were informed that the waiter had lost our credit card. So after having to complain about it, they finally said they would look for it in every bill. After waiting another 35 min they finally found and the the waiter had the nerve not to hand the credit card back, but THROW it to my mother. I've never seen such shitty service in my entire life, i would have rather eaten at home with some macaroni and cheese then spend a dollar at that Cheesecake Factory! Never going back again. We even sent an email about the service there, and we have yet to hear anything about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=800
Teena S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",145,236,83,4.0,6/15/2009,"for someone who lives in an area that has such limited food options, this is always a failproof spot.  im convinced that these huge franchise restaurants cant mess up thei food since its all pre seasoned, pre made sauces and things - the food remains the same and never differs, i will base this review on the service cus that could always be a hit or miss.  it was sunday night close to 8 o clock and the restaurant was still full of patrons but there was no wait. we got seated outside as requested and enjoyed a rather nice meal without the loud music or constand hustle and bustle. the waitress was really accomodating and very attentive even though she seemed like she was catering to a full section. again - cheesecake factory is always a fail proof spot if you want to dish out large sums of money are large amounts of decent food~",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=800
Zachary D.,"Marina, CA",0,101,,5.0,7/7/2012,"this is truly a full on restaurant. i have been going to this cheesecake factory for over fifteen years. i love how casual and how classy this place can be. during lunch or an early dinner its pretty casual place. but once that sun starts to set, here come the expensive cars and the louis vuitton handbags. everything here is amazing, the restaurant itself is beautiful, though i have always thought it was kind of dark inside. i just love this place, and you cant leave without getting something from the bakery, their namesake is pretty damn good. the restaurant is really one of a kind, from the kind staff, to the clean restaurant, to the perfect food, and the prime location. where can it go wrong? this place really is a restaurant gem.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=800
Beth F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,1.0,1/18/2010,"horrible service. I asked our server if they validated parking in the garage, and she said no. I walk out after a 2 hour event paying $12 for parking. I later find out that yes, indeed, they do validate parking. I was there for a group event. To give us a quiet space, we requested the banquet room. To do that, we had to select a fixed menu at $25 per person. That is all well and good...I usually expect to pay $25 at the Cheesecake Factory. However the entrees were HALF the regular size, and the cheesecake was only offered in two flavors (both gross..chocolate and key lime...blech), and when the slices arrived, they were a THIRD of the size of the usual slices of cheesecake. The agreement also was to include ""unlimited coffee, tea and sodas"", however my diet coke and water got refilled ZERO times, and our waitress seemed uptight when I requested coffee along with my excuse of a dessert. Probably because they Cheesecake Factory management felt it was OK to only provide ONE server for 25 people. The poor girl was rushing around so bad...then I excused myself to go to the ladies room and saw a cluster of 4 servers (not bussers or hostesses) standing around and gossiping as our poor girl was running around like crazy. And the manager just watched all of this!! I will NOT be returning to this Cheesecake Factory. HORRIBLE ripoff for groups, HORRIBLE customer service, and I am out $12 on parking that their employee was too incompetent to answer my parking question.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=800
Roman T.,"Irvine, CA",478,342,1484,3.0,5/13/2007,"Don't get me wrong, I love eating at Cheesecake Factory. Their Cajun Rib Eye is really good and I love their fried calamari. This location however has horrible service. On Mothers Day, after the flowers and the presents, my sister and I had planned a dinner in bed for our mom. I was planning to order a bunch of stuff from this place, have my sister pick it up and have my mom just stay in bed all day while we get everything for her. Is it really hard to understand that I want 4 Cajun style rib eye's with 3 mashed potatoes and 1 with steamed veggies, 2 medium and 2 well done. I guess it was a busy day over there, because before I even finished placing my order the girl on the phone said ""Ok"" and hung up on me. After I called back because she didn't let me finish ordering the sides, she gave me attitude that she heard me before and that there was no need to call back, and hanged up on me again. Now if I got my food the way I ordered, I wouldn't really care that much. When my sister gets home I check the food and noticed that I got 4 RARE steaks, with fries. Even after I called and confirmed my order a second time, to get it wrong is just ridiculous. My mom doesn't like her steak to be rare, so I had fry the steak myself to make it well done. 3 stars sounds like too much for this place, but I've been here before and the food was good just the service was lacking like other reviews have stated. Even if you order out, their service is horrible. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for ruining the perfect Mothers Day, and pissing me off. You're lucky I love your cheesecake, or it would have been one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-canoga-park?start=800
