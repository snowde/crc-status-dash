Lisa H.,"Charlotte, NC",36,4,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Every so often we get the impulse to go to CCF for dinner because of the variety of menu items that will please all the members of our party. But, after we've waited two hours for a table, wait for bread to come to the table, wait for our entrees, wait for a server to make sure we are ""ok"" with our meals, wait for tea refills, wait for our check to be closed out. One conclusion can be drawn: his place is over rated. Way over rated. The",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=40
Justin B.,"Orlando, FL",117,7,5,4.0,8/6/2017,"My wife and I have never really had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory at SouthPark Mall. Wait staff has always been on point and very attentive. Several times our servers have informed us on options that we were not previously aware of such as paying our bill through the iPhone App, new available Cheesecake options, and even pointing us to the bar for their happy hour specials.  I would give this location a five star rating but there is one issue I have, consistency. The last couple of times we have gone to do the happy hour in the bar area, our apps that were ordered were different in taste each time. My favorite app are the potstickers, but I ordered them three times and all three time they were different. One time they were overdone, next time they were overloaded with the sauce, third time they were near perfect.  Same type of deal has happened with entrees ordered where one time my meatloaf was dry and the next time was slightly undercooked.  My only negative is the consistency of the food sent out. Other than that, this location of Cheesecake Factory is a great one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=40

James M.,"Winston-Salem, NC",2,16,12,4.0,7/29/2017,"First time to eat here. Don't understand why we had to give our name and wait to be called before being seated as we were one of the first customers they had and the place was still empty.  It did fill up fast though.  Over all a good experience. Was busy at opening with people waiting to get in. Service seemed a little slow and we had to wait quite some time for our food.  Mostly the only complaint I have.  Though a slice of cheesecake was a bit much at $7.95,  but I guess they have to make their money someway.

Today we had a great experience!  We started with Tuna Tartare, which was beautifully presented and very fresh. We loved it, and it was a nice diversion from some of their ""not so healthy"" appetizers. For lunch, I ordered my favorite Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the S.O. ordered teriyaki chicken. Both were excellent! Our server was awesome and we really had a great lunch with several drinks.

We gave the hostess our name and she told us to move to the side and we will be called very shortly. She made it seem like it wasn't gonna be long. She also didn't give us a buzzer. We ended up waiting a bit before we were called. Our server was friendly and greeted us quickly. I got the egg roll sampler. It was good but definitely not worth $12 for 4 egg rolls cut in half. My sister in law the the chicken and biscuits and she liked it. My husband got the salmon and thought it was ok.

DeAnna B.,"Charlotte, NC",92,17,2,2.0,2/26/2017,"Starting with the good! I love love love the cheesecake and the variety in both entrees and desserts. You always get plenty of food for the price which isn't going to break your pockets. The staff is always nice, attentive, and quick. That's where the good ends. In the past I frequented this place like every other weekend but as of last year that is not the case. I hate to say this is no longer my favorite place. Cleanliness has become a issue. Barely wiped tables/ seats and crumbs on the floor are too obvious for me to ignore. The food has become very inconsistent and can sometimes be sent back a couple of times before satisfactory or just giving up on the dish completely.  It can be super busy so reservations would be nice but that isn't a big deal if you don't mind waiting.  Overall its just decent at best now with exceptional cheesecake and good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=40

The menu is giant so even the pickiest of your friends will be able to find something. Desserts are always good. The service is always sub-par and you should expect to wait over an hour on weekends just to get a table. We have tried getting takeout during the week and it still took a long time even when no one was there. The three workers at the dessert bar were talking in the back room or texting on their phones. I decreased my review after Cheesecake told me to try going in the morning or later in the evening.

Also my server Courtney was wonderful, PATIENT, and constantly kept our glasses full. The food was as expected (tasteful, large portions and fresh.) Our only problem was a salad containing beets and asparagus arrived without those items. The cooking staff should have informed the patron or the server of the issue. A manager did address it once the mistake was realized and informed us that they were out of beets. As for the other meals, the food was hot and fresh. Well seasoned and the chicken is never dry. Their meatloaf is double the average serving you would receive in other places.  Most people will have enough for a box to go.

Our server was attentive to our table, including our two children, and she made sure we enjoyed our meal and our experience at The Cheesecake Factory. Having seen other people try several other menu items, we each decided to try new things. We started off with the Fried Macaroni and Cheese and Guacamole & Chips. My wife had the Lettuce Wrap, I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and our guest had the Pasta Di Vinci. We will each have these again one day soon...unless we decide to try something new again.

Sapna F.,"Charlotte, NC",110,73,18,3.0,8/11/2016,"So this review was just because of national cheesecake day.  So every year they do half off cheesecakes,  we'll you would think they would be prepared for this day way in advance and make sure they have enough staff to get this process efficiently.  We got there and people had no idea where the kine was or where people were waiting or where to go to get in the restaurant.  Then it took about 20 mins to order.  So we were excited that it wasn't too bad because of all the confusion.  But then we waited and waited and waited...  It took 50 more minutes before we even got our cheesecake.  People who ordered after us were getting there cheesecakes before us and there was no organization to the process at all.  You would think they could have just kept pieces of cheesecake already in the boxes so they could give it to people immediately.   Sorry this review doesn't completely reflect the whole restaraunt because we didn't even eat there so I can not talk about their service at all.  So I don't want this to reflect them Completely...  But I just wanted to let people know not to go on busy days like that!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=60
Bianka M.,"Charlotte, NC",283,441,2117,3.0,10/6/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, initially I'm not a big fan because I've been there done that since high school back home in Chicago. However I have a teenager and this place ROCKS to teens so we end up here from time to time unfortunately. When I'm forced to eat here I enjoy the small plates menu items which include the avocado rolls, salmon rolls & mushroom pizza. Our teenager ALWAYS indulge in the Buffalo Blast as an app and chicken tenders with fries as a main course. The hubby alternates between Jamaican Black Bean chicken and the Miso Salmon. I personally LOVE the Miso however this location is off on flavor and the whole Miso experience.  It's pretty weird that Grand Luxe Cafe and Cheesecake Factory are owned by the same company. I prefer Grand Luxe as its much more upscale and the food options are better and much more tasty and presented better. Grand Luxe would've been a perfect fit for SouthPark mall, wishful thinking as I'm a Chicago girl and we have it ALL. The dessert choices include the Lemon cake/cheesecake, the red velvet cheesecake and the chocolate cake. Enjoy if you like 1,000's of confusing options and the pain of the mall traffic and long waits without the ability to make reservations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=60
Audrey P.,"Louisville, KY",0,2,,1.0,8/15/2017,"My family and I came to this location to celebrate my birthday. I thought it would be a fun celebration with good food but the service was absolutely horrendous. Not only did our server disappear, we had to wait for a whole hour before our food was served. For that whole hour we were also ignored and asked for a bucket of ice for our bottle of wine, which came. We then tried to wait to see if she had said anything to the manger but we realized that she hadn't. So we reached out to the manager about everyone around us were served and leaving before we got served. But the manage handed our check off to another server who never brought it back to the table. Finally we decided to head to the hostess stand to find where our check went. So bottom line, it was horrible service and the management/servers/kitchen was extremely unprofessional and we will not be going there ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=60

I've been an avid Cheesecake Factory fan for years but now I realize why I never compliment the service.  The food is amazing as well as their fantastic cheesecakes. There's a large variety so there really is a little something for everyone. However, I've come to realize that I have the same issues almost every time I come as far as the amount of time I'm waiting on food/service.  Today I happened to want to surprise my family with some cheesecake and tried calling ahead numerous times to put in a to go order and no one picked up the phone. I understood and shrugged thinking that it must be busy. I am a server and working in the food/restaurant industry has given me a very forgiving perspective. Come to find that when I walk in the door, it is completely dead and the hostess is letting the phone ring nonstop without picking it up.  Now this could be the hostess' fault for ignoring her duties and I will always come back for the food--but I urge Cheesecake Factory to put their employees to be the absolute best they can be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=60

I asked if I could just have it on a different type of bread and he said no. Apparently, the ingredients are ""pre-measured"" for the type of bread it goes on....WHAT?!?!? Just change the damn type of bread! If a kitchen can not just make the sandwich fit on a different bread, we have problems. So, I ordered the chicken avocado club, and it was decent. Chicken was cooked well, fries and ranch were very good. Husband got the lunch shepherd pie and he said it was good as well.

There are times when it's absurdly crowded and waiting for an hour for a table.  I've probably had the Herb Crushed Filet of Salmon over a few dozen times. Consistently good, what can I say.  Avocado Egg Rolls for your app is a sure thing, ask for the ranch to dip with, believe me, it will change your outlook.  Staff most of the time are tentative, occasionally there are times when service is slow, but that's expected with high volume locations.  Most definite recommendation.

Rob W.,"Charlotte, NC",10,100,963,1.0,6/3/2016,"OK so why does it always take a bad experience to bring me to Yelp to post a review! I love adding food pictures (944 of them if you want to know) , but tonight there was no food, so inevitably there are no photos of food.      Why you may ask?        Well, let me explain. It was around 9:45pm or so when we entered the restaurant, there were no lines or waiting, so we (my wife and I) were promptly seated in what I will refer to as man bun hell. After being seated between two groups of folks along the bar seating area, we were just getting a taste of the evenings adventure as it took approx 5-6 minutes for our server to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered ONE Chicken Marsala to be split, It was not long after that our bread and water arrived, but that was all.  By now it was around 10pm as this was clearly stated by our guest at the table beside us as it was getting late and they were ready to leave.  It was about 5 minutes later that the table to the  right of us received their meals and they had time to finish their food even after ordering 5 deserts to go.  At last look, it was 10:38, we had run out of time, patience and understanding.  Our server appeared to be distracted by a table we will refer to as ""friends"" since he was at that table for at least ten minutes - socializing. He did bring by an empty plate for us to share our meal should it ever arrive.  We received two refills during this time. At no time was an apology given for the lack of food coming from the kitchen.  The table to the right was cleaned and a new group of four guest were seated.  The hostess stated that they would be taken care of ""she promised""......I stated that ""they should not believe the lies"", as we were obviously not taken care of.  They brought this to their service attention, but our own server arrived and I made it clear that we were leaving.  He suggested that we speak to a manager, however it was too late.  I stopped by the hostess stand but the manager came by. During this time, the server was observed laughing and showing no interest toward any guest. Upon leaving the restaurant I called and was promptly placed on hold for seven minutes.

For our entrees, my wife ordered the smoked salmon which was thinly sliced and doused with a balsamic glaze for $11.95, and I ordered the French country salad with chicken for $15.95. Both were quite good. We intentionally kept things light, knowing that we were each going to do some serious damage to cheesecake for dessert.  As an admitted dessert snob, I did have my doubts regardless of the fact that cheesecake was their specialty. I never consider any dessert unless it's made in house and most of the time they are not. After drooling over the choices on the menu and in the display case, we finally settled on the Oreo and the praline. Slices are huge and run a very reasonable $7.95 when compared to similar restaurants. More importantly, they were other worldly! The Oreo cheesecake had fresh crunchy Oreos baked in, an Oreo crust and was topped with crushed Oreos and fresh whipped cream. The praline was equally as good and was topped with Nutella and fresh creme. No we didn't finish them both but we sure did enjoy them there and at home. I am nonsmoker, and never have, but I almost had to have a cigarette afterwards. Yes it was that good! Hey what can I say, I was wrong. No wonder people wait 2 hours to dine here. I won't do that anywhere no matter how great but I will return for another 11:00 Saturday lunch. By the way, when we left at 1:00 there was a 2 hour wait. Overall, menu was huge, the food was great, the cheesecake incredible, service provided by Melissa was attentive and helpful, and the atmosphere was comfortable and fun. And on top of everything else, it had a 96 sanitary rating. There's no way I can give it anything but five stars! And of course it is a Gotta Try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=20
Raymond S.,"Elliott, SC",0,2,,2.0,11/19/2017,Today was the first bad meal and customer service experience I've experienced at any cheesecake factory. I had my usual dish of cajun jumbalaya pasta and it was obvious my portions were reduced and the care taken to prepare the dish was not evident.  The usual food presentation was gone.  My rasberry lemonade was awful.  They have even decreases the portions for cheesecake as well.  Lastly our waitress was very slow.

Ebony C.,"Charlotte, NC",92,134,78,2.0,10/22/2017,Horrible service! This was my first and possibly my last time eating at this location. I'll probably stop by and get a slice of cheesecake but that's all.  My waitress kept forgetting about us(my daughter and I). I ordered a burger and added mozzarella cheese. My burger was supposed to come with fries but I never received my fries. My waitress later apologized and offered to boxed them up so I can take them to go. She later returned with the bill and NO fries stating that the cost of the mozzarella cheese ($1.50) was removed from my bill instead. She placed the bill on the table and walked away. About 10 -15 mins went by and I was still waiting to pay my bill. I got impatient and walked to the bar area near the patio to pay. At first the waitress standing there was hesitant to to process my bill but I explained what was going on she processed it and walked away. I could have walked out without paying or without leaving a tip but that's not me.  Next time I will stick to just the cheesecake!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=20

Taryn R.,"Charlotte, NC",243,394,1868,3.0,11/2/2016,"Considering I wasn't expecting much from America's most unhealthy restaurant, I have to admit, I walked out not totally put-off. So, first, the obvious... Yes, this place is way over priced. And yes, most dishes have an average of 1,000,000 calories. But, I looked a little harder at their novel of a menu and discovered their ""skinnylicious"" offerings. I question how some of these items (fried samosas, I'm looking at you!) are considered skinnylicious, but I'll let that go for now.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken. The menu touts it as less than 590 calories. I wonder how many servings come on the plate though... It had 3 chicken breasts, for crying out loud! Anywho, I ate about half the plate and boxed the rest to go. It was tasty, with LOTS of oven roasted cherry tomatoes, capers, asparagus and artichoke. Expensive at $16.95 though! The price you pay for less calories? Go figure.  I landed here on an office outing. While I wouldn't ever choose it myself, I also might not shudder at the thought of going back if the need ever arises again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=20
Bruce A.,"Columbia, SC",0,27,,5.0,12/21/2017,Suggestions: Be ready with your cheese cake order when your waitress takes your drink order as an appetizer.  Food takes a little while so don't skimp on appetizer s. Tex Mex egg-rolls are a great real appetizer They have lots of other entries but I really like their hamburgers.  After the cheese cake and appetizer you don't want to be carrying your food to go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=20
Joy R.,"Waxhaw, NC",67,121,49,3.0,6/9/2017,"Last night, I called and made reservations for today at 2pm to celebrate our son's end of middle school time. I was told to arrive at 2pm because the table would be given away at 2:10pm. Our party of four arrived at 1:45pm to learn the person who answered the phone did not record our reservation. The hostess was less than helpful and gave us a pager to wait like the other 25 parties there! Dissatisfied, I grabbed a manager who was gracious enough to rectify the situation.  Our waitress was kind and pretty attentive. Our entree selections included shepherd's pie, shrimp scampi without tomatoes that arrived with tomatoes, kids' pizza and a Cuban sandwich. Everything tasted ok. If you do have the shrimp pasta, know that it comes with five shrimp, not many noodles and barely any ""sauce"". Oh and we did have a good appetizer, the buffalo blasts! Known for their cheesecake selections, you can't go wrong. I have a caramel pecan turtle concoction waiting in the fridge for me now.

Angelia L.,"Newton, NC",0,16,6,3.0,7/1/2017,"I've had Cheesecake Factory many times and each time I think the food is average. It's way overpriced for the quality served. Today I got the fish tacos, $15. The presentation looks great but the I could taste everything but the fish. The fish was unfortunately bland. I've had better for a lot cheaper at food trucks. I think everything on the menu is way overpriced and there are just way too many items to choose from.  I think the cheesecakes are worth the money, they are delicious, but the actual food is really not. I'd enjoy the experience more if it wasn't so pricey. I usually don't dine here but a friend of mine wanted to for the cheesecake.  The service is so so. Our waiter smelt of cigarettes which was a super buzz kill and really unappealing because we were about to eat. He came and went really quickly just to take our orders and serve the food but we never got a refill. We hardly saw him. I'd also like to mention that the floor is always slippery at every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too and this one is no exception. Maybe it's the wax they use but they should reconsider this as it is prone to lead to accidents and injury.  Probably would only come back for dessert but nothing else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=20
Judith F.,"Fort Mill, SC",37,86,9,1.0,2/5/2017,"This used to be my absolute favorite go to restaurant for the last several years. Anytime we had a special occasion we have always gone to the cheesecake factory. My birthday is January 28 and we went there to eat Sunday the 29th. To give them credit it was an insanely busy day, but that was no excuse for the horrific tasting food that they put in front of me. I ordered the sweet corn tamales and I've never ordered anything else there because those are my absolute favorite things. The plate was scolding hot the food was stone cold it tasted horrible even my guests tasted it and couldn't believe how nasty it was. One of my friends ordered the cheeseburger with bacon on it and macaroni and cheese and ordered it medium-well... it came out about as raw as steak tartare!!!! They brought her burger then eventually they brought her bacon and even later they finally brought her fries. She ordered ranch dressing to go with her fries and it tasted awful. She's just a young girl and she was so embarrassed and thought she had done something wrong because her meals so bad that my insisted they take it off my tab. Her mother ordered the chicken Parmesan with carrots and mashed potatoes. She said it was actually quite good except that the carrots or better and not at all what she expected from the description on the menu.  All in all, we were there for four hours from the time we sit down at our table until the time that we finally were able to leave.  Our meal was handled so poorly by the manager that I decided to find a new favorite place for my birthday. This actually makes me quite sad, but I can always order takeout cheesecake, and I found a copycat recipe for my sweet corn tamales. So if I really want them that bad I'll make them myself. Our waitress was actually quite good, it just wasn't her fault that the food was coming out slowly and was not prepared correctly.

Its posted outside. Dim lighting...I love me some romantic mood lighting on dates. My dish of choice is the Louisiana chicken. The chicken is fried to perfection and the pasta is delightful. They serve you bread when you are seated which is warm and delicious. The cheesecake. OMG the cheesecake. I haven't had one I didn't like. They have any kind you can think of.

They have an extensive menu which I have tried a lot of, but Kevin and I have found the two dishes that we love and get every single time!  When we have a gift card, we usually get each dish, but if we don't, we usually get the combo, as these two dishes also come as a combo.  Great amount for us to share!  We of course love it when we have a gift card so that we can have it for multiple nights!  What are the dishes?  Chicken madeira and steak Dianne!  Both the chicken and steak are awesome.  We love the potatoes too!  If you get the chicken madeira, ask for extra sauce on the side because it is fantastic to pour on the mashed potatoes! We are full by the time we are done, so we always take our cheesecake to go.  Can't go there without getting cheesecake as it is awesome and cheesecake is my favorite!  My favorites are the red velvet cheesecake and the apple streusel, which we happened to get both of those this time.  Normally we try out different ones each time, they have some other good ones as well.  I am disappointed that they got rid of my favorite a couple years ago - the oreo cheesecake, but now they have the oreo dream extreme, I've had it once, but just give me an entire oreo cheesecake rather than all the chocolate richness in the cake and other layers!

Our server forgot our bread, did not bring us appetizer plates for our appetizer, then my husband's beef was very undercooked. When reported to the server she replied that ""they won't do anything because there's less than half left"" She, herself realized this was a ridiculous statement as demonstrated when she nervously glanced at the plate which was 95% full and only a couple of bites taken. She had already passed by the table a couple of times, glanced at his plate and never once asked if his meal was ok. I ordered the same entree and also had undercooked meat but less so than my husband, however even though there was also a good portion of my meal remaining she did not ask how mine was and if I was satisfied. She proceeded to ask if we wanted dessert, then brought the dessert before clearing the dinner plates, and without fresh utensils or napkins.  We'd have requested a manager on the spot but we were in with our daughter who is only home for the weekend and we chose to try and enjoy the remainder of the meal with her.

S L.,"Charlotte, NC",0,16,1,3.0,7/5/2017,"The Cheesecake is to die for!  Of course---very yummy!  The rest of the food was pretty good too.   Hostess, Bartender and Server not so much!  I get that this is a busy restaurant and the Host/Hostess are met everyday probably with giving people long wait times, but being pleasant goes a long way. When you immediately start fidgeting with your computer screen punching in buttons with a stressed frown on your face, thankful our parents who have never been to Cheesecake Factory didn't have to endure this rude greeting.  Next, it's on to the bar for a couple glasses of wine and a virgin daquiri (we told the bartender before we ordered we would make it worth his while :)  -- expected that to get a little friendly response.  No instead an abrupt stomp off to make it.  Comes back we ask for a wine list and bartender seems annoyed we are not ordering food.  Ask about the house chardonnay and he tells me it""s compared to Beringer--blick!  That's a first!  So we get our wine and settle up immediately, we were going to hang out, but we felt very unwelcome here.  Decide to sit outside for the rest of our wait, the seating outside is really nice and it was a nice night.  Finally, the buzzer rings and it's on to dinner.  Waiter is pleasant enough but, seems frazzled and not overly friendly.  Takes our drink orders, brings them back with bread basket.  Takes our order and app order.   App comes out, probably good time to make sure everyone has drinks still... nope.  He disappears then, apparently at this restaurant there are no food runners so, the waiter is also responsible for getting your food out to you too.  Seems like a BIG mistake to me--unless your organized and a good waiter/waitress.   We were a party of 6 and like I said first time our parents had ever been here and we were hoping to treat them to a good evening.  So half of our party got our food right away, the other half waited and waited (typically at most restaurants when food comes out seperate like that it is expected that the rest of the tables food is coming up right?).  We saw our waiter take another order, before he got the rest of our food.  No checkback really, and definitely no drink refills, unless  you count the time I flagged him down.  When our waiter finally came back to the table, ingredients from my salad were missing, had to get waiter to go ask for those items.   Like I said food was good enough and cheesecake was awesome, but for what you pay to eat at this place and the wait, you expect better service!  There are a ton of great restaurants in our area and for us this is not one we will be in a hurry to return to.  Best part, we also get the impression that the people who work there don't really care if you come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=80

Your menu is a spiral-bound book.  Take your time and get lost in the offerings.   Beware the ""skinny"" options.  Yes, they are low calorie and low fat, but to me they are so lacking in flavor and substance that one would have to be on a very strict diet to be subjected to the skinny life.   Otherwise, far from the skinny life are many wonderful salads, sandwiches and entrees.  Iced tea is endless and refills are prompt.  The bread is crusty and warm.  I especially liked their soups with the bread.

I couldn't even see the booth or menu and saw other tables using their cell phone light to look at the menu. When did the lighting change? Our waitress was such a disappointment, first forgot the lemon for the water, forgot bread, after two requests, and then brought out of one wrong meal. The wine selection isn't that great and the wine we both ordered was horrible. As for the entrees, again, the crab cakes were blah. My friend got the Chicken Romano and was a pile of spaghetti with breaded chicken, which I found very bland. After attempting to order another drink, not another glass of wine, I never received it. Finally asked for the bill, which reflected that second drink.  The worst part about it, $70 for two drinks and two entrees. Isn't this the Cheesecake Factory?

The Cheesecake Factory is a place of much confusion, but the confusion only testifies to its goodness.  The atmosphere and architecture can be confused for an Indian palace. The kind wait staff are indistinguishable from Chick-fil-A employees. The menu can easily be mistaken for a phonebook.  The bathrooms parallel dimly lit, royal throne rooms of old.  The bill has an uncanny resemblance to the U.S. national debt.  The cheesecake, however, is distinctly unique.

Kandis A.,"Augusta, GA",510,506,2921,4.0,10/5/2015,"While in town I wanted to treat my mother to a lovely dinner because she had never dined at this franchise before. I had been years earlier with friends of mine and I said that time I had to have my mother try this place as well. I told her she would be in store for a great treat and that's what she got. As we entered this place to put our name the list for a table, the line was out the door and there were many patrons sitting outside in the nice sitting area for there name to be called as well. The wait was about 30 minutes for a table. That was fine since we didn't have anywhere in particular to go this Saturday afternoon.  The 30 minutes came and went fast by us people watching others going in and coming out of the mall. Once we turned in our buzzer it was still a 5 minute wait to get seated still. We finally were placed in a busy, small corner of the restaurant by the hostess. This was cool because it was just 2 of us and enough space for both of us. Our waitress came and introduced herself within minutes of us sitting down. We looked over the menu for awhile. After bringing our drinks the waitress informed us that she was leaving for the day and another waitress would handled us from here on out. This was fine as long as we still got top notch service. The menu was filled with all kinds of things, chicken, pasta, hamburgers, and things like that. I had a very hard trying to choose what I wanted to eat. It was either the Parmesan chicken or the Seafood pasta. I ended up choosing the chicken and my mother chose the 'glamburger'. Both were great choices. My dish came with 3 chicken breasts, green beans, and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were out of this world!!!!! They were absolutely amazing. The chicken and green beans were good but I couldn't get enough of the potatoes. My mother enjoyed her hamburger and fries. It was a pretty big burger too. We both had tons to take home.  Then came the dessert!!! How could you go to this restaurant and not order cheesecake?!?!?!?!?!? I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake but I do love a Strawberry cheesecake and that's what I got and my mother ordered the Key Lime cheesecake. Only complaint I have about my cheesecake is the bottom crust. I didn't particularly care of it but the rest was delicious. My mother really enjoyed this little dinner we had!!! I'm so glad that I was able to have her dine here with me for the first time!!! I'm sure this won't be her last because she is now HOOKED!!!! I'm sure she would want me to take care of the tab again also!!!! LOL!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=80

Jess L.,"Charlotte, NC",269,275,160,3.0,6/10/2015,"So listen... it's not BAD. They're just not consistent. And when I say that, I mean it in every sense of the word. You could get something spectacular one night and order the same dish again the next night and not get the same quality. I went there with the lady and another couple to celebrate achievements on all of our parts. The girls ordered drinks, which they thoroughly enjoyed.  And then the food came out. I ordered...uh... some jamaican jerk thing? With chicken instead of shrimp? Jeez, it's so hard to remember when the menu is that big. I'm sure that there are a bunch of jamaican jerk things with chicken. But this one had beans and a mango pineapple salsa! And plantains!  The chicken was excellent, the slaw was good (but room temp, not cold), the beans were okay (they lacked seasoning), and the yucca was seriously overcooked. I was with my Irish buddy who had never seen plantains before and he asked me if I ordered shit (yes, they were that charred and shriveled. I gotta say, I don't blame him). However, it's really hard to mess up the internal flavor of a plantain, and overall, it was fine. The lady ordered Fish Tacos, and she was not pleased. But I can't blame her, they had soaked the damn thing is so much sauce that the actual tortilla broke when she tried to pick it up because it was too saturated. She said it also lacked any flavor, though I didn't try it. The cheesecake IS consistently wonderful though. I do wish they gave a weeee bit bigger slices, but what can you do.  I do enjoy coming here, I really do, but... it never turns out to be as good as I think it's going to be. Phew. Feels good to get that off my chest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=120

Jacqueline P.,"Charlotte, NC",157,219,103,3.0,11/21/2016,"Generally speaking I'm not a chain restaurant fan. This place is decent though. We came tonight for my moms birthday and I get the appeal for her. She's a midwestern bland food kind of person. Nothing wrong with that, but I am the exact opposite so I only find it ""ehhh"". The menu is insanely large and overwhelming. Seriously, I've never seen a restaurant have so many options and I'm not sure that's a good thing either. The prices are also very high, however one entree is enough food for two people so it evens out... Seriously the portions are ENORMOUS. I finally decided on the Parmesan crusted chicken and it came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The chicken tasted good but the Parmesan crust was soggy. The green beans were bland and underdone but the mashed were very good. It did take forever to get our food. This is definitely not the place to go if you're in a hurry. I love their pineapple upside down cheesecake however it's seasonal and not available... I haven't had it in years so it may not even be a thing anymore. I opted for the original; not bad but obviously comes in frozen and then thawed for sale. My mom got the key lime cheesecake and I wasn't a fan. I prefer New York style cheesecake and this was really thin. However if you prefer the thinner version you will love it and huge bonus point the whipped cream is homemade and not from a can!! Overall it's an a-okay place for a meal. It absolutely knows it's audience and appeals to them successfully.

Aastha G.,"Overland Park, KS",15,34,25,2.0,5/29/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory so don't get me wrong as this review is totally about this experience. I have been a regular customer to the Cheesecake Factory in Kansas. However this Charlotte one was my first experience. I didn't mind waiting for 1 hr 15 mins and didn't mind the fading lights. Lights were very dim to read the menu comfortably but I didn't mind as I knew what I wanted to order. I always start with Avocado egg rolls as they are my favorite. However they weren't as crispy as I have had them earlier, it seemed they were sitting on the kitchen counter for around 10 mins after being fried. Which resulted in the lack of crispness.  For the entree I wished to try a new item, the ratatouille toast. The presentation was beautiful and appetizing. The ratatouille was delightful however the toast was burnt and very dry. It was hard to eat but thinking about my prior experience with Cheesecake Factory I gave it a go hoping that the next piece would be better. But I realized it was hopeless cause. This was reported to the manager and he offered to replace it but by then I just lost my appetite. He took it off the bill which was a kind gesture. I wouldn't have mind paying for it as its all about the having a good experience. For desserts it was lemoncello cream torte, which is a masterpiece. Refreshing lemon mascarpone cheese sandwiched between moist vanilla cake topped with streusel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=120
Hashani S.,"Ventura, CA",494,523,769,3.0,8/1/2015,"We cam here on for happy hour during National Cheesecake Day. Happy hour is M-Sat from 4-6p. Sadly, they do not have any drink specials during happy hour. :( The food though, is amazing! $5.50 for actually small plate sizes, which is a lot. I made the ""mistake"" of ordering 3 apps for the 2 of us, so much food! We ordered the mac and cheese balls, cheese and spinach dip and southwest chicken rolls. Everything was really good though the cheese and spinach dip could have benefited with some seasoning. The mac and cheese balls and the southwest chicken rolls were very hearty, we had to take a lot of food home with us.  What I did not like was how much the Long Island Iced Tea costs (I docked 1.5 stars for this), I blew $10.70 for a watered down drink. It did not feel like that much alcohol was in there. I won't be buying drinks from here again.  The half off THE FIRST SLICE of cheesecake was a great deal, my boyfriend and I each bought a slice. I got the caramel turtle while he got the tiramisu. The caramel turtle was amazing, wasn't too cream cheesy and had the right amount of sweetness. The tiramisu was just meh, I wouldn't get it again.  Don't forget to complete the feedback survey, you get $10 ecredit towards your next purchase. Pretty worth it if used during happy hour (there is no fine print saying you can't).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=120
Anthony H.,"Charlotte, NC",168,152,434,2.0,2/22/2015,"A menu that is a mile long and a wait time going to an hour and a half with no ability to make a reservation is asinine. When we finally did get to the table to sit, we weren't greeted for about 15 minutes and that was the best part of the evening. After taking our orders, our waitress didn't check on us again until the food was served but but by that time my wife and I had no water just ice cubes sitting lonely in the bottom of our glass. I ordered the Miso Salmon and my wife ordered the Petite Filet. I wasn't pleased at all with the Salmon because it was pink in the middle and my wife didn't really care for the Filet because it wasn't cooked to order. We decided not to have the food sent back because it would've taken forever and two days to get the food back.  The wait staff seemed like they could care less and on many occasions they were simply MIA. They tried to push desert on us but we were ready to go and get desert someplace else. This is not the type of service I expected because I've been to other Cheesecake locations across the states and this was the worst experience. The staff needs more customer focused training and being attentive not blind to the needs of your clients. I based on this experience couldn't recommend you to spend your money here unless you enjoy mediocre service. I don't write my review lightly because I understand that business can get packed and scheduling issues can affect service but if you're in SouthPark, fix that if you expect to stay relevant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=120

Sure, it's not ""fine dining"", but the food is always good and the portions are so large! With that said, my sister threw me a baby shower at this location on 2/13/16. They don't take reservations per se, but my sister was assured, 3 weeks ahead of time, that they would hold the back room open for our party of 25. My sister called the morning of the shower to make sure everything was still a go. This was around 10:45 am and she was notified that there was already a line of patrons outside the door. We hurried to the restaurant and arrived around 11:30 am and were told that the room and tables we were promised had already been taken!! We decided to stay and wait, as invitations had been mailed out, and it was too late to change locations. Suffice it to say, we did not get seated until after 1 pm.

We shared a waitress and she was extremely pleasant, but much more attentive to the larger party. She told us our food was coming right out three times before we got it, I honestly think she had forgotten about us.

I mean I would find any excuse to go here...but after a while things changed, the food was different and I stopped going. And then my friends came to visit from Virginia and where did they wanna go????  Our good old standby...of course!  And here we go: Drinks:  My favorite for a long time has been their Georgia Peach. Vodka, Peach liquor swirled with raspberries and topped with a mint leaf so it looks like a peach in a glass. Perfect! Always delicious, and most certainly expect to order two! Mmmmmm!  Appetizers: We ordered the wings without the sauce. They were okay. A little dry but we just doused them in blue cheese and ranch. There are plenty of other options so unless you're craving wings try something else. We also ordered the Buffalo Blasts. Now these things are freaking delicious! It's chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce stuffed in a wonton and fried. You can always sign me up for anything with the words ""fried, chicken and cheese"" in the description. They were ahhhhmazing! Crispy on the outside juicy flavorful meat stuffed on the inside (and they are not stingy with the filling) served hot with ranch dressing...like Nike says Just Do It! You can thank me later!  Dinner:  I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon. It comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus over a lemon sauce. I'm a huge fan of the lemon sauce (always ask for extra) but last night the salmon just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, portion size was not the issue. But it was just very bland. The potatoes are chunky with pieces of the red skin, not a favorite for me but that's just my personal preference. The asparagus was cooked perfectly and dipped in the lemon sauce....simply divine!

Boy was that a wrong call especially since this is their slowest night! So I complete and pay for my order by 8:01 and was quoted 20 to 25 mins and waited until 8:42 at which point I asked the same take out cashier who had rang me up what was going on she replies waiting on fries and I said well you told me 20 to 25 she replies back I said 25 to 30 I said no but let's go with that then what's taking an extra 15 by the time that banter is done she had no answer except would you like me to get a manager and I replied yes that and the food you said would be ready within the 30 minutes that's now 45 so I wait for him ( Adrian) I believe was his name and after watching him deal with another customer to whole he gave a free slice of cheesecake because I'm guessing resolving yet another dissatisfied customer I unleash a flurry of choice words on their lack of customer service and kitchen performance because 2 hamburgers and a couple of salads do not take 1 hr worth of prepping because the prep boy that came in at 6am already chopped everything up and it's a matter of putting it all in a box. Meanwhile I have a viewership because I have become irate over the lack of concern as the store manager I believe Brandon to be was just watching with a blank stare and I ask him what's he doing and he states just listening to you didn't want to interrupt so I said you'll have to cause I'm long winded. Had nothing to offer so I had him go chase for his business card so I can call corporate or at least email them with first hand insight to their Monday night standards and hope they can improve on it. See the things that makes me so mad, irate or just blow my lid is unlike most people that complain I wasn't looking for ""free"" anything as I always reject such option. That's a band aid on an open wound. What I want is for you to take the time and go look into the issue and fix it and not give me this blank stare like you are surprised to see a customer so upset over a couple of burgers taking an hr to be made. Are you freaking kidding me! I've seen junior chefs make complete meals in an hr and yours can sling out some burgers in 30 mins. Time for training session or new cooks. They're a dime a dozen I'm guessing since it's not a restaurant where you have the liberty to make your menu as you go. Hope this helps you Brandon with what the issue was and you jump on it and get it taken care of. I know it's not the first time service has been lack luster and that's putting it mildly!

Sasha R.,"Charlotte, NC",158,313,2010,4.0,9/25/2013,"If you can't find something you love from Cheesecake's extensive menu, something is wrong with you. The white sangria was strong, sweet and delicious.  Avocado egg rolls are perfect. Crispy exterior and soft flavorful interior. I like it dipped in their homemade ranch better than the sweet dipping sauce the egg rolls come with.  Chili Rellenos were somewhat disappointing. The hot, melty pepper jack cheese inside is awesome, but the pepper has a very green pepper flavor rather than any spiciness. The crunchy fried outside is good but overall this was a miss for me. Not really worth the calories.  The veggie burger was made with beets (along with brown rice, farro and black bean) and was not good at all. It was cold and sweet and bland.  You can't go wrong with any of the desserts. We had the banana cream cheesecake, which is our standby favorite. And I also tried Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, made with layers of brownie, coconut cheesecake, chocolate cake, coconut frosting (similar to the topping for German chocolate cake) and whipped cream. It was good, but I've had better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=140

Kris G.,"Goose Creek, SC",41,67,4,3.0,9/6/2015,"OK, I went in with really high expectations from everything I've heard about this place. We went on a Friday night around 8 and only had about a 15-20 minute wait. We were seated and our waiter seemed very nice at first and told us to take our time and soak in everything. I was amazed at the menu, it had anything and everything you could possibly want and then some.  The fried Mac & Cheese balls were AMAZBALLS and our food was delicious.  I was very disappointed with our service though, he started off great, and I don't know what happened, but it seemed like we were bothering him by sitting in his section. He treated the other two tables he was waiting on very different and was super friendly but any time he came to the table we had to request refills on drinks and he just never checked in at all. This was a huge disappointment because like I said I had super high expectations coming in.    Bad Service aside, the Cheesecake is to DIE for!!!!! Oh My Goodness, My husband tried the original cheesecake, but I had to go all in. I got the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake and let me tell you it did not disappoint.  It was a layer of brownie, topped with a coconut chocolate chip cheese cake, topped with chocolate cake, and if that wasn't fat enough it also had a coconut pecan frosting on it.  Yes it was a completely fat *ss item, but it was so worth it. I would stay on the elliptical all day to have that once a week.  Overall it was an ok experience.  The food was AMAZING, but the service was very disappointing. :( I will definitely  give it another try and for sure at least get some cheesecake to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=140

Corbin M.,"Charlotte, NC",104,3,,1.0,9/25/2016,"Suggested Cheesecake Factory for a birthday dinner meetup with family from out of town.  We've been coming to CF for years, all over the country for several reasons.  One, variety of the menu.  Two, consistency.  Three, convenience.  You don't go to CF for its uniqueness or specialty menu, you go because you know exactly what you (should) be getting . . . This local CF failed at 2 out of 3 tonight.  Convenience: 30-45 minute wait at 5:50 pm on Sunday that was every bit of 45 minutes, yet plenty of open tables in our section.  Understaffed perhaps.  Followed by excessively slow service.  Forgotten items (missed an app and a side), too long to take orders, too long to bus the table, if at all mid service.  Water refills nonexistent.  This is restaurant 101 stuff. Consistency: failed here too.  Steak undercooked and cold (credit where due, at least it wasn't overcooked), menu items I've had elsewhere simply not the same (a cardinal sin of the dreaded chain restaurant), and in one case the dish was served with a significantly different setup than described on the menu.  All prepared with minimal adequacy.  It was edible but nothing remarkable or even good by CF standards. Saw another table leave in frustration after walking up to the service station for a drink refill for the same reasons: slow, incompetent service. I guess what this Cheesecake Factory has going for it is an anchor location in the local high end mall and a captured audience.  They simply do not need to perform at restaurant fundamentals to continue as a business, people will still fill the place up.  Which is a shame, because CFs can be quite good, when they're not failing at basic functions. Do yourselves a favor and walk over to many of the other almost as close options so this store can just end it already and give up the space to someone who will execute as if they care about their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=140

The menu has plenty of burgers, sandwiches, steaks, burritos, etc. good selection of salads as well.  The downside to Cheesecake Factory is the wait to get a table.

Danielle P.,"Columbia, SC",267,162,404,2.0,5/30/2016,"Ive eaten at Cheesecake Factory at other locations and had a much better experience, so here we go....We arrive around 12ish on a sunday, which was a horrible time at the South Park mall, dont do it, unless U are jus that bored.  We waited approx 1hr, didnt leave because we knew all the other restaurants would have the same wait time. Once we were seated it went all down hill from there. We didnt get a ""hey how are U"" nor good afternoon, The waitress Whitney K. acted as if we were a bother the whole time. I ordered the veggie appetizer, had to ask for sauce, then I ordered the fish and chips-  asked her if I could substitute the the cole slaw, she said ""no its a Garnish and we cant do that"". She never asked if I wanted to maybe pay extra for a salad or maybe another item. I had to ask for vinegar for my fish, not really understanding at this point why I didnt jus pay and leave. I was so done so no matter what she said or did I wasnt hearing it. Next I asked for the manager, he proceeded to listen and apologize.  The food really wasnt good after all this mishap, we paid and I left no Tip, which I have never done, this could have been my child. But I feel U should give 100% at work at all times, if not GO home, plenty of people need a job. Im not always happy at work either but I make sure I dont reflect this in my service to the public. Once a manager or owner of a business has mastered this with there employees U will have happy customers who will wait and return. I went to Olive Garden the next day, and the staff were all 100% my waiter earned the 20% I left him. I never asked for anything, he was very professional and they were busy on Memorial Day!! Now this tops it off, before leaving I saw Miss Whitney show my receipt to the manager, I left no TIP, she made a weird face to him....really do U expect me to leave my hard earned money to someone who was rude to my family???  I wont return, my coins will B spent elsewhere....ENUFFSAID",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=100

The falafel was good but there was something about the dressing that I can't put my finger on that I didn't like, but the veggies tasted fresh and was good otherwise! Of course I couldn't leave there without getting myself cheesecake, and tried the pumpkin pie one which was absolutely delectable! Only other critique I have is that the tables are a little too close for comfort, while the others surrounding us were very friendly my friend and I couldn't have a conversation without one of our neighbors chiming in.

Our cocktails tasted like dirty dishwater and I was not alone in that thinking. Big fan of cheesecake and sweets in general. Tried the new nutella cheesecake but should have stuck with the classic.

Mike M.,"Fairfax, VA",1312,108,110,4.0,7/17/2013,"I'd first like to preface my review by saying that I prefer to eat at non-chain restaurants too.  But of the chains, I have a special fondness for the Cheesecake Factory. Back at my old job in Virginia I would take clients out to lunch quite often, and where did they always want to go? The Cheesecake Factory. Have gone there so much, I really got to try a variety of different dishes, from the salads, to the pastas, to the steaks, salmon, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I tend to order the louisiana chicken pasta or a steak. Or one of their great salads if it's lunch time.  I was never a fan of restaurants with such an extensive menu, but Cheesecake does a good job. I cannot recall ordering anything that I didn't like. Don't get me wrong, I can't recall ordering a dish and thinking that it was my favorite ever, but Cheesecake is pretty consistent. And their portions are large so you feel like you're getting your money's worth. That's why I think it's always busy on Weekends for lunch and dinner. There really is a lot to choose from, which is good when you have a group of people that can't decide on cuisine that night.  The service isn't bad. I think that people in general need to understand that when a restaurant is super busy sometimes the level of service dips a little bit. And not all server is created equal. In every restaurant there are servers who move more efficiently, make few mistakes, and...well...for a lack of a more eloquent way to put it...are just better than others. And unless you're a regular you probably won't know who's who. Having waited tables in the past I probably tend to have more patience with service. That being said I've had great service on weekends and off-peak hours here than I did on the weekend dinners that were had here. coincidence? I doubt it.  Not much needs to be said about the cheesecake. It's always terrific.  You know what to expect with the cheesecake factory... huge menu, diverse selection, decent service, great cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=180

By the time the food came I didn't want it cause the party of 4 I came with to eat was done with there food. I will never come here ever again food is over priced and over rated. Only good thing was my White Russian and the over priced small price of cheese cake. Then the manager didn't even comp our ticket or any thing. Not that I'm cheep out of being a good business to make some one want to come back if your ever in South Park Charlotte don't come here.   This place is terrible waste of money and didn't enjoy crap at least I had a hour drive home and a new Mac Pro to play with,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=180

First the waiter was so busy she never even looked at us or give us ant real atention. She was rushing us to give her the drink order and pushing to order our food as soon we sat down. I hate waiters to rush me before I even have a chace to look at the menu. I ordered a Cesar Salad  wirh Chicken when I started eating I found a long black hair tangled the the lettuce. So gross. Then my daughter's meatball and spaghetti pasta came. OMG! Horrible no taste completely cold and the plate all dirty with this disgusting tomato sauce. Sent it back asked for them to write off from check and the only thing they took out was the salad. The supposed Manager came to the table, a very sloppy looking blonde older woman, never gave eye contact or an apology, just told me she would get me another salad. Another salad? Forget it!  One hair was enough. Our family will never be back to eat here again. A $90.00 check was a complete slap on the face.

The service was great, very attentive and friendly.  One thing I do like is the variety of food offered which is both good and bad, I guess.  We had the avocado eggrolls which are pretty tasty, I don't want to know how many calories were in them but nice chunks of avocado fried in an egg roll wrapper were complimented by a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. I had the mushroom burger which frankly was very good.  It was well put together with very flavorful mushrooms and swiss cheese.  The cover the burger in some kind of wine sauce which was welcomed.  Fries....nasty.  Too much salt ruined them.

Rachel O.,"Columbia, SC",208,207,924,2.0,11/17/2012,"I don't usually review chains but this was my 1st experience there & I was very disappointed. First off,  the restaurant is very nice looking.  I liked the ambiance from my point of view in the lobby.  When we were seated... not as much.  We were tucked in this little alley off to the side of the bar that led to what I'm sure was a nicer room that looked out into the parking lot.  We couldn't see much from where we were sitting except the waiters running back and forth and the little area where they entered orders on the computer.  But I'm jumping ahead... we got there a few minutes before 7 and had to wait 45 minutes for a table for 2.  Some people coming in after us were told up to an hour and a half! I know this because the pager/beeper they give you is only active IN their lobby.  So there were about 50-70 people all standing around this lobby starring at each other and the cheesecake in the case.  Not cool. Finally our beeper went off and then we were told to stand in a certain spot to wait for our name to be called. More waiting.  Then we were taken to our little alley table. The menu is 21 pages long.  And then there is a Skinnylicious menu on top of that. Ridiculous.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip.  It was fine.  I've had better. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken.  It was OK. Again... I've had better. Boyfriend got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta: Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce I didn't taste it but he said it was fine but nothing he would crave again later - and that he liked another pasta dish from another restaurant much better. We each ordered a slice of cheesecake.  I got the Chocolate mouse cheesecake which I thought would be light and fluffy but no.  It was very heavy. It was very expensive in my opinion.  We both got water, we shared an app, each had an entree and a piece of cheesecake and this came to $71 after tip.  For what we got? It was not worth it at all.   2 stars on Yelp means ""Meh. I've experienced better.""

However, that is where the good news ended. Our server lacked attentiveness. I fully understand being busy; but she definitely made a judgment call and decided our table didn't merit as much attention as other tables. Our food was not hot and had no flavor (I ordered a chicken avocado club). I informed the server and she shrugged, complained about the kitchen and then went back to her other tables. At no point did she make any offers regarding our poorly prepared food. However, she gave the table next to is free cheesecake because they had the same issue. Look, I don't need free cheesecake, but I expect you to acknowledge a complaint about my meal. She then failed to ask us if we needed anything else.  Instead, she brought our checks and moved on. Poor service. I tipped her more than I should have (she deserved a penny, but I gave 10%). I live in the Southpark area and will never return there. Also, it took over 2 hours from start to finish.

We sent an appetizer back because we misunderstood what it was. After that she transferred us to another waitress. By that time we had already been waiting for our food for 45 minutes and by the time we got it, it was all wrong.  So why the positive review? This was an isolated incident.

For my 21st birthday all I wanted to do was eat at the infamous Cheesecake Factory. We went around 3ish so the wait was only about 5minutes.  Being my 21st I kind of expected for the server to at least notice when I got carded and ordered drinks that it was my birthday and he didn't. The drinks were good though. My boyfriend told the server as he passed by that I was a little hurt and the climatic moment I had been waiting for was ruined and he admitted that he only checked the year.  Overall the food was meh. I got the steak Diane and shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes. They must pre plate the potatoes when you get the combinations because it turned into a molded shape in the middle. The shrimp and steak were bleh and I can't even complain that I only received 3 shrimps and 3 steak medallions because they weren't very good. Boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken and it was fatty. He said it was alright but the menu says it comes with a plantain. They had a grilled banana on it- maybe they expect people to not know the difference?  Cheesecake was very good though.  I will never be visiting again. The server did the bare minimum. We left spending $115 including tip but the boyfriend was charged $121. Even though it's $6, that's sketchy. Boyfriend called the manager and the manager said to call his bank because he saw that we were charged $115 but he had to keep explaining that he was over charged.

My salad was excellent but my girlfriend wasn't a fan of her sandwich. We also got two apps and cheesecake afterwards. What I really want to talk about was our service. It was incredible. I think our waitresses name was Lynn (could be wrong). She was very engaging and knowledgable about the long menu. We asked a lot of questions I mean a lot and she answered all of them and was very patient. We eat out way too much and this was the best service we have had in a long time. I'm done. Food was good service was fantastic! We do not eat at the cheese factory and only went because we had a gift card.

This time we got the appetizers after 30 minutes and then only got 2/3 of them and then they served the first dinners with the 3rd appetizer. We had to ask the waitress 3 times for our bottles of water before we got it. The manager came out and apologized for the appetizer coming out so late, and that's fine, of course no problem, that stuff happens. But then the waitress had to be asked three times for the water and we never got out coffee with our cheesecake (which of course was awesome!). I'm shocked at the service and quality.

Bruce K.,"Knoxville, TN",420,649,1234,3.0,1/20/2012,"Cheesecake. Yes, that's what they're famous for.. And probably the only thing that I will eat here as everything is overpriced and the food is just okay. I came here with a group of friends weeks ago for a get together. I just ordered a drink and my brother ordered a cheesecake and calamari which I shared with. The calamari wasn't bad as it was deep fried like any other restaurant that serves calamari. Cheesecake was wonderful, apple caramel streusel. It was sweet but it wasn't to the point where my mouth was dry (then again I had Long Islands that helped me wash it down.) One of my other friends ordered a burger, and honestly to come here to order a burger isn't really a bright idea. The portions are definitely not worth the amount that you're paying, however this is a ""high class"" restaurant. And be sure to watch out on the floors. They're super greasy/slippery, as soon as you walk out of the main area and to your chairs. It seems as if you're walking on some dried oil or grease, it's kind of nasty to not think that they would not mop the floors every night. Overall, I would give it a 2.5/5 but since Yelp has stars I'll round it and give it a 3, just because that cheesecake was pretty good.

Elizabeth A.,"Charlotte, NC",167,109,235,4.0,4/7/2013,"I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory is definitely way above par for your normal chain. The menu is a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for.  The menu is also HUGE. Part of that monstrosity is advertisements (annoying!) but there really is a ton to choose from. I have weekly (if not daily) day dreams about the Avocado Egg Rolls. Holy moly this appetizer rocks my world! Yes, it's an appetizer, but I actually order it as my entree, whoops. These rolls are chocked full of crazy amounts of flavor and texture. The middle is gooey and savory and the outside is crispy and delicious. And the dipping sauce, some sort of cilantro chutney... SHUT UP! It's amazing. I also really enjoy the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes appetizer. These little babies are sweet and salty at the same time. Very filling. Nice presentation. My favorite appetizer salad is the French Country Salad. Veggie friendly and delish. The only thing I've had here I have NOT enjoyed was Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. It's pretty boring and lackluster, I do not recommend. And last but definitely not least, their namesake... the CHEESECAKES. Oh lord. Yes, It's okay to come here just for cheesecake. No one will judge you. I would like to say I've tried them all. Unfortunately I'm in love with the Tiramisu and order it EVERY time.

Ana O.,"Charlotte, NC",116,328,28,2.0,8/28/2013,"I am sure that this is a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory as far as things go.  Maybe I'm not a fan of this location or maybe I'm not a fan of this chain period, but my last few experiences here have left me disappointed. One positive thing I can say is that they have an extensive menu.  In general, you would be hard-pressed not to find something you are in the mood to eat.   However, I've gone in there before and nothing has sounded appetizing - maybe it's just too many selections.  I can say that they have decent (but pricey) salads and I had good fish and chips from there.  I went there with a party and my boss ordered the barbecue salmon, which was WAY too salty for her. This was a day we were out to celebrate a co-worker leaving and had a party of four.  We waited almost 20 minutes to get seated, and then another 20 minutes almost before we could order.  By the time our food had arrived, we had been there over an hour.  This was lunch time, which was frustrating.  Our lunch there lasted over an hour and a half by the time we got dessert. As far as their cheesecake goes, this has been the biggest disappointment.  It used to be you paid $8 and got huge pieces which were big enough for two to share.  However, my piece last time was about half the size it had been before.  It looks like they are trying to scale back on the sizes.  And when I thought about it, I got one of the specialty cheesecakes and so only about a third of it was actual cheesecake, and the rest of it had toppings woven in.  Not on TOP, as you would expect, but cutting into the piece of cheesecake itself.  The cheesecake part was not as good as it should have been for the price. This location is swanky and nice, but every time I've been the service was very slow.  And since getting dessert and a lunch special was over $20 at lunch time, it seems a little too pricey for the quality of food and service you get there.  For me, ""meh"" just kind of describes how I feel about this Cheesecake Factory location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=200

She took the pager and called the next name so I proceeded back in line. A guy calls my name and I tell him the same story so he said he was getting me seated since he can't hold tables and would have my order transferred. He said they were busy. Then he asked if I needed a menu and I said no.( I knew what I wanted. Not the friendliest guy. So as I get seated, there was a five minute wait for a server to ask me what I had so I have her the receipt and she took my drink order. I was starving at that point and saw how busy it was I knew I didn't want to eat there. My cheesecake was finally brought to me after my drink and surprisingly I wasn't asked if I wanted anything.

Having spent the entire winter, and well into March in a snowy DC mess, it was great to sit on the outdoor patio at 4:00 in the afternoon with a Root Beer and a cool breeze blowing in my face. -Minimal wait. Maybe no one wanted to sit on said patio, but the waiting area was 50 people deep of couples, families, etc and we only had a 10 minute wait for first available.  -That wide variety of menu items you know and love from CF, including a nice selection of lunch portions (and lunch prices).  -Friendly staff. Something I miss once I moved to the DMV. -Quality ingredients, and tasty food. I ordered the lunch grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes for $13.95. The salmon was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. Other dishes ordered at the table included a cheeseburger, cobb salad, and chicken wings. All were devoured.  -Food presentation is great. I love the way they serve the dishes to you with thought and care. -Happy Birthday! My cheesecake plate had Happy Birthday written on it, with a pink candle for me to blow out! They also sang Happy Birthday to me. Ahh never gets old even in my late 20's! *Cons* -My broccoli was served cold. I mean ice cold.  -The fountain drinks all tasted flat no matter what you ordered. -When my husband ordered after dinner coffee, and she asked if he wanted a refill she did not tell him refills were not free.

Unlike the name suggests, you can order more than cheesecakes here.  Even though we were originally going to have lunch here, we decided just to stick with cheesecake for dessert. Looking at their menu (briefly might I add and going on when I actually did have dinners here), you can get your typical dinners here (chicken, stekas, pizza) and price wise, it is the about the same as other dinner places you might go to.  The menu does seem overwhelming (as we were only looking for desserts) as this particular location was also running ads for other businesses in the area (not aure if all locations do this as well).

A meal can range anywhere from $12 (for a burger) to $30 (for the filet). $20-25 per person is the usual on how much I spend.

You can quickly turn to the lunch menu, page 8. The portions are plenty and will run you around $10, give or take. However, their regular beverages will run you a solid $4. A nice perk is that they serve their ""chocolate and vanilla"" bread (that's only how my friend's daughter describes it, not the flavor) anytime of day, whether you eat lunch or dinner. They do not have very many vegetarian options, but they do have a veggie burger filled with brown rice and beets.

Nikki W.,"Charlotte, NC",68,68,26,4.0,8/1/2013,"This review isn't about the Cheesecake Factory themselves but a props to their happy hour. We all know Cheesecake Factory... big portions. An extensive menu. Stark white shirts that I have no clue how every server keeps them bright white all shift. But have you ever been by for happy hour?! Best in Charlotte. Hands down.  Post up at the bar (HH only at the bar) and grab a menu. About a dozen different options, all from the Cheesecake Factory's regular appetizer menu all for $5 each. Chris and I decided to get the tex mex eggrolls and the buffalo blasts. They delivered the dishes and damnnn... full-sized plates. And if you've ever been to CCF you know how much food that is - and for $5! I couldn't believe it wasn't smaller HH portions! The buffalo blasts were piled high - 8 to the plate. And is a crispy, fluffy, deep fried pocket. Bite in and it is filed with juicy grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. And as a huge lover of all things spicy, I was in love. I recommend with sour cream. Awesome cooling effect to the buffalo. We ended up eating 3 of the blasts and 4 out of the 6 eggrolls. Packed a to-go box and left highly satisfied.  Only downside, I work in Uptown and the happy hour here goes from 4 to 6pm. To get to South Park after work is always a challenge so if I have my heart set on some buffalo blasts, need to slip out a bit early. And you must sit at the bar. Which consists of 10 seats. Not always the easiest seat in the house to get!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=240
Victoria W.,"Charlotte, NC",58,767,1166,4.0,3/29/2013,"This place is 4.5 stars for me. I've been coming here for many years ever since they opened. This place is ALWAYS crowded during dinner time, if you come around 6-8 you will probably have to wait unless if you made a reservation, this is particularly true on the weekends. I have tried numerous appetizers, pasta entree, burger entree, and cheesecake desserts. Overall, the flavor of the food is great, the presentation is also commendable and the portion is very large. Because of the large portion, on some of their dishes they offer 1/2 sizes. The interior decoration is very nice, 2 floor high ceiling, golden deco, very spacious and many different sections. They have a full bar overlooking a great view. When you order pasta, they always bring out parmasan and shred it right in front of you. Love their pesto and sundries tomatoes. They also always bring put a basket of wheat and white bread after you order. Entrees range around 12-18 dollar. Appetizers around $8-12. Their appetizers are pretty big too, i ordered the avocado spring rolls once and i was able to eat it as an entree. The avocado spring rolls are amazing, i highly recommend them. They are different than any other spring rolls you've had. Perfect flavor and consistency over a crispy shell. If i remembered correctly, there are 6 large half pieces of spring rolls. The cheesecakes are around $6-8 per piece. Very large size served on a large plate, can be shared among 2-3 people. Drinks are around $7-12, pretty good as well, great mixed drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=240

Jeremy P.,"Marshall, NC",3,55,3,4.0,7/28/2013,"Me and my family visited The Cheesecake Factory for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  First off, we are not from Charlotte and we do not have a Cheesecake factory near our house.  We are Big Bang Theory super fans so when we saw it we knew we had to try it.   If you are like us and have never been or saw one other than on the show, then you will be in for a big surprise too!   Atmosphere:  We arrived around 8:30pm on a Sunday night.  The wait was minimal even though it was pretty busy.  We requested outside seating since it was a perfect night for it, and were escorted right out.  Tables were nice, and had a small candle on it for a nice little touch.  The building the restaurant is located in is very nice as well.  Very upscale looking and a classy place overall.  Much different vibe and style than was in the show.  ( Hang with me through the BBT show comments, I am sure others are wondering the same as we were. )  8/10 Menu and Price Point:  As most others have mentioned the menu is very very extensive.  You would be really hard pressed to not find something that you like.  Very detailed which I like because I am a picky eater, and nicely laid out considering the size of the menu.  As for price, I got the Penne, My wife got the Chicken and Biscuits (think chicken pot pie), and my daughter just wanted cheese sticks.  We also got 1 piece of the Oreo Dream cheesecake and the total bill was 53.00 and some change.  Not too bad considering the portions are huge and the food was very tasty.  7/10 Service:  When we first walked in the greeter was not super friendly like most places of that caliber but, when we were seated things changed.  Our waiter was extremely nice and super helpful.  He was very attentive despite being pretty busy, and took the time to talk to us and offer suggestions.  He even addressed my daughter who is 10, which most of the time wait staff just look at us for her order.  I liked that and i think she did too.  8/10 Food:  The food was very good.  Like i mentioned above my daughter got an appetizer for her main meal which was the Cheesesticks.  She liked them and even made the comment she wished there was more.  On a couple they were overcooked a little but she didnt complain and just peeled off the coating.  My wife had the Chicken and Biscuits and she really enjoyed it and gives it a 8/10.  She could only eat about half a quarter of it due to the sheer amount she was given.  I got the Penne Pasta, and it was cooked perfect for me.  It was a little short on sauce but really was very tasty.  I did add a little salt, and I asked the waiter for some Parmesan cheese and he brought out a block and grated some fresh for me right at the table.  Im a big guy and I couldn't eat it all due to the portion size.  8/10 for me on the pasta.   I will definitely be back for me on my next visit.   P.S.... Haven't tried the cheesecake yet but its a massive slice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=240
Scotty S.,"Concord, NC",103,173,360,4.0,1/3/2014,What's not to love about Cheesecake Factory!!! Been there several times (due to my fiance dragging me to South Park for shopping) and every single time the food was awesome. I tend to order their sandwiches as my fiance tends to get their entrees. I've only had one complaint (plain onions instead of the caramelized ones advertised on the menu) but it was minor.  The service is awesome and the wait times have been short for us (under 5 mins). The star of the menu is the dessert selection. Can't go wrong with any of their cheesecake options.

Sydney A.,"Charlotte, NC",209,137,148,2.0,9/14/2011,"Overall I don't really mind the cheesecake factory.  I just think that if you're looking for a nice place to eat there are MUCH better options that something attached to the South Park Mall.   The wait is always atrocious and even when you do have reservations it's doubtful that you'll actually get seated on time.  The food is overpriced for the quality you are getting.  The waitstaff is nice but they are busy because the place is enormous. The atmosphere is corny.  I can't think of any other way to describe it. Do yourself a favor and take a look around when you walk in there.  Stop being a stereotypical American and go eat at an independently owned shop.  My bet is you will be much happier, eat about 2,000 less calories, and get out the door for a heck of a lot cheaper!

Rachel B.,"Charlotte, NC",209,211,92,4.0,1/3/2013,"Best chain ever. Yes, it's a chain and yes there's tons of local eats, but I argue that there is no place where a party of 20 people can get everything they're looking for, no matter what they like, what dietary restrictions they have and what they're in the mood for. The mood lighting at night is great for a romantic dinner that isn't too intimate (no pressure!) or a nightcap and cheesecake (sexy!). The hours are later than most other places in the area, too, so if you're running to grab a bite after a movie or something, the Factory is a great option. I tend to battle between getting the Thai Lettuce Wraps (fresh, quality, delish!) and the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, no cucumbers, but almost always get both because I can't stop myself. Sure it's way too much food but these are things that I sometimes DREAM about. And sure there are vietnamese and thai places that carry the lettuce wraps in town but I've tried and every time I'm left yearning for that tamarind cashew sauce.  BRB, drooling. --------------- And, I'm back! So yes, the service is always attentive but the waits can be long, especially at peak dinner hours and all day Saturday & Sunday during mall hours. The bar is fully stocked, bathrooms always clean (and posh!), and the outdoor patio makes for a pretty nice summer lunch spot too. They've got a bar bites menu that's available to keep it light on the pockets, and of course more cheesecakes than should be legal to tempt you into ordering just 1..... ok, 2 slices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=240
Steve B.,"Bamberg, SC",0,32,6,4.0,1/8/2016,"We were going to be in the area and my wife wanted to eat here. Wow, what a beautiful Resturant. We took the advice of another Yelper and ate dinner at another restaurant and stopped by for desert. It was around 2:00, and were seated immediately. As stated in another review the wait staff was indeed ""stuffy"", but that's ok. The Resturant decor is beautiful. We both had a drink,mixed to perfection. I decided to have the Ahi tuna Tatar appetizer, and we split a slice of 30th anniversary pie. The tuna was 1-3/4"" of avocado with 4 pieces of tuna, no bigger then the end of my little finger, on top. But that's ok. The Resturant is beautiful. The pie was the real hit, and was enjoyed to the last crumb. The bill for two drinks, 1 appetizer, and 1 slice of pie $38. When we left the Resturant we both busted out laughing. We couldn't imaging what the bill would have been if we had eaten lunch. By the way a slice of pie is just under $9.00. A whole pie is $$50.00.

Amy C.,"Charlotte, NC",71,355,145,3.0,7/15/2013,"I have to say, first, that the customer service that I received at The Cheesecake Factory went above and beyond, definitely.  My server was excellent and after an issue with a dish, the manager who visited my table also went way beyond what most would have bothered with, in particular since it's The Cheesecake Factory and losing one customer would seemingly not be a big deal, since I arrived at 5:15 on a Thursday evening to a packed house.   I haven't been to the Factory in years.  I don't like going to the mall and I don't like waiting an inordinate amount of time to be seated.  I had a craving for cheesecake, so I made a run here after work.  Since it's attached to SouthPark mall, there seems to never be any down time at all.  Even upon my early arrival I had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  No biggie, I was seated within 5 or so minutes and instantly greeted by my server, Bonnie, who was absolutely fantastic.  She had her hands full and the section was completely booked, but she did a fantastic job.  I heard a table near me compliment how well she did, after she returned to thank them for what I assume was an extra-large tip. The food: Fried cheese sticks:  6 triangles.  Thick breading, nice melty cheese.  Marinara that was served with was meh.  Tasted weird, kind of plain, but nothing offensive.   Fried chicken salad:  When they first opened this location, this was my go-to order.  Huge ""normal"" salad with fried chicken on top of it.  In the many years it has been since my last visit, the recipe has changed and I was not a fan of the new way.  The menu said ""mixed greens"" and I forgot that kale is no longer just a garnish.  Too much kale, way too much kale.  But the fried chicken served with it was quite good, as was the corn and pecans with the honey mustard dressing.  I picked through the salad, but it was mostly kale, so I just ate the chicken.  My server noticed and said she would bring me something else, but I told her it was my misunderstanding, no big deal, I ate all of the chicken and a few pieces of lettuce and that was fine.   Turtle cheesecake:  Eh.... it was okay.  Creamy cheesecake with a healthy swirl of whipped cream.  Large dollop of a thick chocolate cream on top, plenty of nuts.  It was fine.   The server let the manager (I believe he said his name was Johann) know about the salad and he came by the table and told me that had been taken off of my bill.   I told him as well that it wasn't necessary as I ate all of the chicken and what I could of the salad.  He again said it was taken care of and if I had any other problems to let him know.  Very nice and totally unexpected.  Excellent customer service. I don't know when I will return, but the great job by my waitress and the manager on duty definitely left a very positive reflection on the place, I just wish the food was as good as the staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=240
Cindy A.,"New Orleans, LA",16,80,17,5.0,1/5/2013,"I love The Cheesecake Factory.  I used to work near one in Seattle and was somewhat of a regular.  After moving to Louisiana, I have to travel a minimum of five hours to get to one.   On my way to Virginia over the holidays, we drove through Charlotte specifically so that we could go to CF.   This location of CF is by far, the best I have ever been.  We had an awesome booth all the way in the back (read -- away from all the noise).  Our server was friendly and helpful.  The food at this location was great!  Hot, huge portions and there was no skimping when we asked for extra sauce for our dishes (a must if you are a sauce freak like we are). My daughter had her usual farfalle pasta (chicken, mushrooms, peas and some other stuff) and I had the chicken madeira (chicken, mozzarella, madeira sauce, asparagus and smashed taters).  It was all soooooooooooooo delicious!!   We ordered one cheesecake -- the banana -- which is served with freshly sliced bananas.  It's now my second favorite to the lemon with raspberry glaze.   When CF comes to Baton Rouge or New Orleans, my life will be complete.  Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I will be stupendously thrilled. My recommendations --  Thai lettuce wraps (enough for a meal or appetizer to share) and then something from the specialties page, pasta or salad.  Skip the stuff that you can get anywhere any day of the week (burger).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=240

This particular location feels too large, like I felt like I was getting lost in my booth b/c the place was so large.  The food was on par with what I have come to expect from this chain, but it was the service that warrants the deduction in stars. Throughout our experience the service was fine- not particularly good, not particularly bad- but that all changed as we were getting ready to leave.  I had asked for a box (b/c the portions are just too large here) and was in the process of placing my leftovers into said box when the waitress came back after running our credit card. As I still had my hand on my plate, picking at the last few fries that did not fit in the box, she swopped in and took the plate from me. Really????

Chad E.,"Charlotte, NC",187,2236,1436,3.0,11/4/2009,"Walking into The Cheesecake Factory (at night) reminds me of a Las Vegas Casino.  Not the downtown casinos that are all closed in and almost claustrophobic, mind you, but the expansive Steve Wynn casinos on the strip.  It's huge.  It borders on gaudy, but in a nice way.  You also can't really tell what time of day it is - probably so you don't mind how long you wait for your server to come back to you (though we did). I'd imagine that during the day, the monstrous windows in the front of the place give it a ton of light, and it would be a completely different feel, but at night, it just gave that vibe.  The noise is pretty incredible too - like the old noise of casinos (they don't have noise any more, sad to say). As to the food - pretty impressive overall.  I just wish that they didn't have 300 items on the menu.  And I didn't count, the server gave that number when I asked for a suggestion since I didn't feel like opening the tome of selections.  I eventually settled on one of the items from the specials list (Caramel Chicken). We also had some crab cake appetizers, a massive double BBQ burger, a chicken sandwich and an order of popcorn shrimp.  The fried food overall was the worst.  The burger was good, but huge.  The crab cakes were surprisingly good.   It was really the service that did them in, but to their credit the manager (or someone doing an imitation of a manger) came out to tell us that the food would be out some time.  Then we had to also wait on the bill, and to pay the bill, and so on... If I had any suggestions, it would be for them to go on ""Kitchen Nightmares"" with Gordon Ramsay.  Not because the place isn't clean - it's immaculate.  But the size of the menu, coupled with the portion size, is insane.  Cut the menu in half (or quarters), and do the same with the portions.  They could even shave something off the price at the same time. That way every person wouldn't be walking out with leftovers and they wouldn't have to spend so much time at every table trying to help diners navigate the menu.  Not to mention, there would be room for dessert.  You know, the cheesecake?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=280

Jimmy D.,"Charlotte, NC",190,295,28,3.0,6/8/2011,"Hi Cheesecake Factory I like you but I'm not in love with your crazy wait times, or giant sized portions. Your place looks pretty cool though, I like high ceilings, and I can appreciate the sizable outdoor patio area, but can we get tables that are a bit bigger please? It's really crowded! Adjoined to Southpark Mall is the ubiquitous Cheesecake Factory. Every time I go for a shopping spree I see tons of people waiting their turn to get into this place like an exclusive nightclub and people leaving with bags of food. So I finally decided to try it out after a shopping spree one day. The place feels very cavernous walking in with super high ceilings and some paintings to gaze at as you're looking up wondering how much their power bill costs. Well then the waiting game begins, first we checked in to the hostess station and was told there will be about 45 minutes wait which turned out to be about an hour, okay no big deal I thought. Turns out the buzzer thing they gave me was to announce that I could now wait in the shorter line to actually be seated! What a tease! So now we're finally seated and hungry looking at the huge menu. Some bread came out I guess to sate your hunger a bit from waiting an hour+ to get a seat. I ordered a frozen mango smoothie and appetizers took that took a while to come out by this time I'm wishing they gave me some more bread. The spicy ahi tempura roll that came out is huge and delicious but not spicy at all. Then came the main courses which actually came out on time! I had ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta and was totally unprepared for the size of this thing. I mean seriously it would have taken 4 meals for me to finish this thing off, it was very delicious though! The sudden influx of food at once left me feeling really bloated though so we opted for taking dessert home and bought a tiramisu cheesecake for later. I've probably rambled on too much at this point so I'll just summarize. Come prepared to be hungry in 1-2 hours and not while you're actually hungry. Prices are a bit high for the type of food but they give you enough food for 3-4 meals. I just don't really understand this place the food is nice but I there are plenty of dining options around this area where you don't have to wait for 2 hours.

Our server, Kenneth, was extremely enthusiastic, although he kept referring to my counterpart as ""m'lady,"" which was pretty great and also slightly emasculating. I ordered salad with my burger but got fries; whatever, the fries were great, and there was enough ketchup for both the burger and the fries, which is SUCH a rarity at places without self-serve ketchup. She got pasta, which was also really good, and we shared a Turtle cheesecake. ""I mean, the place is called the Cheesecake Factory. We ought to get some cheesecake.""

L J.,"Boone, NC",0,41,12,2.0,2/29/2016,"First of all, they do not take reservations.  That is a big negative in my book and I almost didn't go as the last time the wait was very long.  They also do not take call-in-advance.  So upon arrival, we were told an hour and a half for a table for two.  The menu is huge and they have lots of options.  The food was okay but nothing special - definitely overpriced for quality.  It was no better and no worse than any other chain joint but significantly higher priced than something like a Sagebrush or Applebys and not better quality.  Five-star prices, three-star quality, one-star service is the best way to describe it.  My date ordered the shrimp and mushroom dish which was served with no mushrooms.  I order the ribeye which was slightly overcooked (ordered medium rare - served medium).  The worst part was definitely service.  Our waiter disappeared for extended periods of time and in fact, never checked on the food which was delivered to the table by someone from the kitchen (I assume), so we never had the chance to explain that the dishes were not exactly correct (I was okay with the steak, but my date specifically wanted the mushrooms in the ""shimp and MUSHROOMS"" dish.  We waited over 30 minutes for the check and another 15 for the cheesecake to-go (which I order before the check).  I will say that the cheesecake was delicious later that night.  I would go back for the cheesecake - probably to-go, but I would definitely not wait for a table when the food is only average at best.  The atmosphere was crowded and chaotic so definitely not a great experience.  I only give two stars because the cheesecake was excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=280

However, this past experience was terrible. The wait was ridiculously unjustified for the quality of food we were served. The coke was without syrup twice in a row, basically watered down coke. I didn't complain the second time, the third time the coke was brought, the glass was so dirty I was disgusted to have drunk out of it. When the food finally arrived it tasted bland and almost as if it had been reheated. The angel hair was stuck together to the point where it needed to be cut into squares.

As much as I loooove good cheesecake (really, I'd eat it off the floor a'la Friends) I rarely get any b/c I'm so stuffed from my Chinese Chicken Salad (or Caesar), the addicting bread & butter and sampling whatever delish dish my hubby ordered. Maple glazed pork tenderloin is excellent (and I do not eat pork.) Spicy Cashew Chicken has been a favorite of mine for years. However, when I do get dessert I will likely order the ADAM's PB CUP FUDGE RIPPLE. Oh sweet jesus..if I were still single, this cheesecake could easily make up for the lack of a man! Cheesecake Factory is great for dates, brunch (HUGE omelets), girl's night out and business meetings. The only reason I did not give this location five stars is b/c (in my opinion) it's hard for any chain to achieve that status but most important, they did not go above/beyond w/a very special request to just this once take a reservation from an out of country visitor. The woman flew all the way from Trinidad, here's her passport and ticket, just got off the plane and the first thing she wants is to eat there; can we NOT make her wait two hours???

After eating one, I asked the bartender if they were indeed the skinny ones. She said no, they were the regular ones but the only difference was there was more and they are bigger.  She asked me if it was too much food. I told her yes, that was why ordered the skinny ones.  She said oh sorry I didn't hear you say that. I get the bill and they charged for the regular ones.

What a scrumptious delight it would have been to get a slice of Snickers or the Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple cheesecake. Hmmm, those so good I want to slap my momma.

S R.,"Pineville, NC",0,52,8,1.0,8/14/2014,"This  CF location has gone down in the last year or so. We have noticed several service issues, especially when dining in the bar area.  At our last outing, our server took almost 10 minutes to come to the table after we sat down to greet us, pass out menus and take drink orders. She was slow to bring drinks, didn't bring a side salad that was requested before the meal. The food was subpar, and they totally botched my order by giving me the wrong dish.  Everyone's food also arrived lukewarm, like it had been sitting for a while. We did address it with the manager who was apologetic and discounted the bill. We were treating an out of town guest who had never been to CF before and were totally embarrassed that we had brought him here. We walked out thinking we should have gone somewhere else in the South Park area. Eating out is becoming more and more of a luxury and it is disappointing when you got out expecting a nice dining experience and  get bad service and bad food. We will not be returning to CF anytime soon and I can no longer recommend it. UPDATED :10/13/14- After making a complaint on the the company website regarding the above visit, we were sent a $25 e Gift  card. We redeemed the card at brunch  about a week a ago and had a good meal and great service. We intentionally sat in the restaurant, not the bar area.

The restaurant was crazy busy and it's huge, so it was really loud.  The tables are like a faux-marble type material, so when the bus-boys were setting the tables and throwing down the utensils repeatedly, the sounds got real old fast. We went here for lunch  and got the nachos with chicken as our app.  There was literally 5 random pieces of chicken on the nachos and it was gross and the flavoring was super sweet, which is weird to put on nachos.  The chips were saturated in grease and I'm not really sure why... I ordered the Monterrey Burger to be cooked medium.  It was burnt/charred in some spots and completely brown throughout the burger.  It wasn't that great.  The arugula it came with was put on top of the hot burger, so it was all wilted and not the best consistency.  I only ate half my burger.   We all got cheesecake since we felt like we kind of had to.  I ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it fell short IMO.  The cheesecake itself was delicious! However, it was covered in thick chocolate cake and it was so rich - I didn't eat that part.

Marshall R.,"Columbia, SC",7,8,2,4.0,2/11/2014,"I've been there twice and it's a good place to go on a nice date. I prefer the places that are more casual or they have their own thing going on, but I won't hold that against The Cheesecake Factory. This place is obviously known for their cheesecake, in case you couldn't figure that out by the name of the restaurant, so I will start by talking about what they do best and move onto the meal from there. All slices of cheesecake are big and rich enough to share. These things are huge and if you're eating one by yourself then you are either a mammoth or your pig. Don't hate! Just embrace the truth! My wife and I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, which had Hulk testicle size chunks of cookie dough inside of the cheesecake. With two big squirts of whipped cream on the top and the tip of the cheesecake to complete the imagery that I'm shooting for. It was simply amazing! When the waitress first stopped by to ask what we would like to drink I asked for water and an Old Fashioned. To which she replied ""How hot would you like that?"" That's when I learned that one of their burgers is called The Old Fashioned. As I write this I now realize that I should have ordered The Old Fashioned to go w/ my Old Fashioned, but let me tell you what I did get before I get too carried away. I got Renee's Special which consisted of a Turkey Sandwich, the Soup of the Day (Clam Chowder) and a House Salad. Very tasty! My only complaint on the food was that the bread, I believe it was Sour Dough was too hard. Not stale or anything, just the crust was hard as a Hulk sized... ...never mind. My Old Fashioned was very tasty and helped me take my mind off of the man taking his three disrespectful daughters out. This good man was taking his daughters out for an early Valentine's Day dinner and all three of them were on their phone and iPads. Hopefully it doesn't take him having a heart attack from the cheesecake he ate for them to realize how disrespectful they were being. I would give 5 Strong stars but I'm going to subtract one for how close the tables were. I didn't even have to lean over to take the food from the person next to me.

Yes they do make good cheesecake and it's a treat... it's also very filling... most of their portion sizes seem like they are trying to feed 2 or 3 people with each plate.

We should've known then that it was too good to be true. My husband ordered a beverage, but never received it throughout the course of our meal. We ordered our dinner around 10:30pm and it took about 45mins to receive our food. We were told by the waiter that it takes a long time to cook a steak well. Really? First of all, you don't tell your customers an excuse like that. It doesn't take that long to cook a steak well either. Then when the food came out, my entree was cold. So that tells me that most of our food was already done but not brought out. Once we receive our food, we saw the waiter one time, then never again. We waited at least 15mins after we finished eating just to get the check. At this point my party is very irritated and just want to leave. We finally asked 2 other servers for a manager. One server stated that the managers were very busy. I told him that they shouldn't be too busy if a customer is requesting to see them. The manager comes out and asked if everything was ok? We all said no, not at all. As he walks over to me, i hear him mumble under his breath, ""everything hasn't been ok for me tonight either."" Or something to that effect. When I asked him what did he say for clarification, he changed his words and said ""what's wrong?"" Like he really cared. Well after explaining to him about all of our problems and he could see that our table was full of dishes, meaning no one had been by to clear the table, offer dessert or coffee. He apologizes for everything, comps my meal but didn't offer anything else for the rest of my family that traveled out of town and are here for the first time.

I am a completely understanding person, especially when a server is seated too many tables at once, but she was talking with other servers, joking around, our son had asked her for some extra dressing and she clearly forgot ( but realized when we had pre-bused our table.) Not only did our drinks were not refilled, she did not once check on us to see how our food was until we we're wanting to order dessert. It took an additional 15 mins to get dessert, which we kinda regretted ordering to have to wait that long. Not only did I leave 20% gratuity, because I am in the tipping business and I do unto others. But I never normally complain on service, and I felt like I was a bothersome to her, I have never had issues at any Cheesecake Factory other than today. But I don't think this woman liked kids or liked us because we are ""young parents"" with tattoos that we would even tip. She probably shouldn't be in this business of customer service.

Holly M.,"Oakboro, NC",0,11,4,4.0,2/9/2015,"If you're dining at the cheesecake factory as a party of one or two, they will often try to stick you in one of their tiny, little tables. You literally sit five inches from the guests beside of you. This may not be a problem for some, but I always make sure to ask for a booth to avoid these tables. This place has a HUGE menu. I don't think you can go wrong with what you choose, though. My favorite dish is the shepherds pie. It's a huge portion and so delicious. I like that, during lunchtime, you can get the half portion. I usually still end up taking some home! If you're not starving, I recommend getting the cuban rolls, which are an appetizer. I enjoy the cuban sandwich, but actually love these even more. They're so crispy and come with a great dipping sauce. Oh, and the cheesecake is a must- duh. Even if you have to take it to-go. I've had so many of their cheesecakes and just can't choose a favorite. You seriously cannot go wrong!

Quite interesting to see a big change in the service and quantity of food.  I remember the service was poor and the food quantity  was very less for the price at all other locations. May be it's just this location. I went in a group of seven and ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entrees. Entrees came in big portions. Especially the jambalaya dish was huge. I loved the bourbon street omelette.  Chicken marsala, calamari, chicken dumplings are always my favorite here. I highly recommend angel hair pasta for all the pasta dishes.

Definitely enjoy the avocado egg roll appetizer.  Fresh, ripe avocado mixed with some diced tomato, red onion...  They are quite good.  As far as their namesake dish, cheesecake, I'm not that big a fan.  Not much of a dessert fan but I do love a good slice of cheesecake and find the Factory's to be a little to fluffy in texture for my tastes.  I prefer something more dense.  They have a large the selection of flavors however and my wife swears by the ""Dulce de Leche"" version.

George K.,"Charlotte, NC",1,33,4,3.0,10/24/2010,"I have changed my mind several times as to whether to make it two stars or three... The food is occasionally very good, but most often it is merely serviceable--you'll eat it, you won't be hungry afterwards, but two days later you won't be able to recall what it was you ate. I suspect that has something to do with the extensive ""something for everybody"" menu, which makes me think no single kitchen could prepare all of these dishes with equal skill. Thus, some items might be sort of roughed out in the kitchen by the cooks, while others are done with flourish and panache. It is a ridiculous amount of food presented on the plate, and I would be a more frequent guest there if the food cost 2/3 as much and the portion was proportionately reduced. I likewise won't bother with a 20-40 minute wait--I'll eat in the food court, save myself about $30 for the wife and me (especially with no wine), and stop by on the way out for some cheesecake slices to go. Finally, I prefer eating outside when the weather permits. It isn't a great view (the parking lot) but the noise level is much lower than inside. Modern restaurant designers seem to have a fetish for hard surfaces within the dining area, reflecting kitchen noise and patron conversation into an enormous dull din. Supposedly, this creates a sense of energy in the place; for me, it is more like eating in a construction site. If inside is all that is available, I'm heading back to that food court...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=300

I knew it was going to be expensive when I saw the 40 ft high ceilings. Someone has to pay for all this air.  The noise level is amazing. I could barely hear the bartender when I ordered a drink. As I sat there sipping on a glass of wine I noticed massive portions of food being served. I saw salads that could feed a village in Afghanistan. What is with the massive portions? I ordered an Angus burger that had to be 3/4lb to 1 lb,  loaded with onions and mushrooms. The place is also pricey but then............ It finally hit me. When you go to the Cheesecake factory you order an entree you want to eat at your next two meals. So you really need to focus on which items are a good for reheating  and taste good as leftovers. By spreading the meal over two or three meals makes the high prices seem very reasonable. So this is why people wait 45 minutes to 2 hours to eat at the Cheesecake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=300

We had sun dried tomato pasta and a pizza. Finished it off with Red Velvet Cheesecake....big enough to share, and OMG delicious!

The soup was so bad I didn't eat it at all.  I ate the salad or there would be no lunch.

The way the tables are positioned, all of the vegetation, and not to mention the ceiling is amazing. I don't like the little tables though, there really isn't enough room for 2 people and all the dinnerware, it seems crowded. The food? Fantastic! I have eaten here many times and I try to get something different every time I go and I have not been disappointed. The crusted chicken romano is a must, so is the stuffed chicken marsala. For some reason, when I've had a dish with marsala sauce, it seems over powering with the wine, but not at Cheesecake Factory. They get it just right to where you can taste the mushrooms and other flavors with your meal. Their garlic mashed potatoes are to die for! They use red potatoes instead of russet or yellow potatoes. The texture is a little lumpy, yet smooth all at the same time.  Let's not forget their cheesecake. That's the reason why you came right? There are 2 pages of cheesecake selections in the menu. All of their cheesecake is wonderful, but make sure you have a glass of water or milk handy because most of their cheesecakes are RICH! They range from your traditional cheesecake with strawberries to a carrot cake cheesecake. If you're a peanut butter fan like myself, fear not, they have about 3 different kind of cheesecake with peanut butter. Let's not forget their carrot cake!! The 1st time I had their carrot cake was at Barnes & Nobles and it was like my mom used to make. Dreamy! As for the wait, be prepared to wait 15-30 minutes on the weekend at least and during the week about 10-15 minutes to get seated. Never have I gone to the restaurant and gotten seated immediately. It's well worth the wait and what better way to wait at the bar? I'm a Long Island kind of girl, but I have had their cranberry and vodka. Their liquor is all top shelf and I always had a well mixed drink, nothing overpowering in 1 liquor.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and very polite. I've had only 1 server that was pretty bad, but that was because we were his last table and we were taking our sweet time. Yes, it's still not an excuse to be rude and try to rush people out, but overall, I haven't had really bad service. Cons:  Long wait to be seated.

Ordered two alcoholic drinks one of which was a mint mojito never had anyone butchered the drink that much it was awful. After waiting an hour after finishing our appetizers our food still wasn't out yet nor was the server anywhere to be found, it being not busy and also a Monday night we didnt understand why it was taking so long, finally the manager came over and told us that our food was accidentally sent to another table, understandable we was patient and said its ok 10 mins later someone other than the server brought the food over to our table and it was not what we ordered. Not touching the food we waited a while til the server came to check on us told her the issue she took the plates away and returned with our order, I'm guessing my food was sitting under the warmer in the kitchen for a while bc my steak Dianne was over cooked and dry when I ordered it rare, and the salmon was fishy and cold. The only thing that was truly acceptable was the cheese cake I guess if they messed that up they shouldn't be called the cheese cake factory!

Megan B.,"Union, SC",6,125,27,2.0,8/6/2014,"Last weekend while running some errands in Charlotte, my husband, daughter and myself decided that it was time to hit up The Cheesecake Factory. Any other time we have gone, the food is always okay but pricey and we always get two pieces of cheesecake to share. This time around, my husband ordered the meatloaf lunch and when he got it, the meatloaf was dry and he compared it to chow hall food in the military. He said chow hall food was better than that! When the waiter came back like 15 minutes later, I told him that the food as gross. He took it away and never said a word. The manager popped up about 10 minutes later and offered him a menu but told him that everyone's tastes are different and they have never had a complaint about the meatloaf before. My thoughts were, ""it's dry and tough....Who would eat that?"" My husband just ordered a soup and salad lunch combo after he got another menu which was priced at like $15. The salad was horrible and the soup tasted like vegetable water almost. When our waiter came to the table, of course I had to be the one to call out the issues because my husband won't and I didn't want to have to pay for something that he didn't eat. Of course they did nothing about it. They just brought out the cheesecake and made us pay for a meal he did not eat or enjoy. Since I'm heading to Charlotte for my 24th birthday next weekend, I will definitely remember not to go back there and they won't get our business again. We will just mosey on over to Maggiano's for our next big business meeting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=340

Their food is just okay and a little bit pricey, but you do get your money's worth in terms of food portion.  They are usually very busy and there will be at least a 15-60 minute wait to get a table. Service will be kind of slow since the place is extremely huge. They do take reservations on the weekdays, but not on the weekends. It will be first come first serve and they recommend you coming in at least 45 minutes early with half of your group in order to sign in.

It's attached to Southpark Mall.  The atmosphere is surprisingly warm despite the just-under-montrous size of the restaurant; maybe it's the high ceilings that make it seem so big.  The menu is also big. If it's your first time, make time before you're famished beyond repair to browse the menu. They are gracious about making substitutions. They are smoke-free inside. When I first arrived in town 2 years ago, this was not the case. I'm happy to see places around town popping up with smoke-free air- fun for the whole family! There is also a bar area. They offer curb-side-to-go  - (704) 770-0915. It is crowded at peak hours. The wait staff has ranged from efficient to friendly to comedian (in a good way).  Oh yeah! They have a HUGE selection of cheesecakes! There are plenty of other dessert choices if you don't happen to like cheesecake.

I said thank you and was continuously polite throughout my visit and she never said ""you're welcome"" or anything very polite back. Whenever I said ""thank you"" she just turned away.

You CANNOT pull out shredded lettuce from a taco...  He did take them back but it took a very long time to replace.  The quality of the taco meat was good though, not the normal ground generic beef.  The mixed drinks looked good, but my husband and I just had a draft beer (only 3 or 4 to choose from, but good choices) bc we were getting ready to spend ALL day shopping in the South Park mall.   I don't mind spending money for exceptional food, but I thought this was just a little over priced for the quality and service.  We would probly go back, but mainly bc the kids loved it so much, not for the quality of the food or value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=340

At first this seemed fine but 10  minutes later the hostess started setting up the table next to us (the tables were about 12 inches apart) with 2 highchairs and a booster seat then seated 2 couples with 3 small children. They were not happy being squeezed into a bench seat with the highchairs etc. but even after they complained to the waitress and the hostess, the hostess seemed unable to come up with a solution.  Seems they could have just moved them to a table where they could move the chairs to accomodate the highchairs.  The menu is overwhelming.  I'm always a little suspicious of a menu with so many items.  I feel like more often than not, everything just ends up being okay and nothing is really good.  My sister ended up getting the burrito and I got the bbq chicken salad.  The burrito was the biggest portion of food I've ever seen in a restaurant.  It could have easily fed 4 adults.  I could only eat about 1/3 of the salad and it was the lunch portion.  The food was good, not great.  The service was good.  I would go again but would request a table, not a bench seat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-charlotte?start=340

I would never, ever wait three hours to eat anywhere were it not my granddaughter's birthday wish to eat at the Cheesecake Factory for her birthday. Upon getting ""beeped"" I approached the front counter where I was confronted with YOUR POLICY that made YOUR HOSTESS RUDE. She informed me that ""policy"" said we could not be seated because all 6 of us were not there. Two were at the bar closing out our check and one was in the mall because as a 73 year old, he needed to sit. YOU do not have anywhere near the seating needed for waiting guests. Are you kidding? Do you really expect everyone to be there immediately upon beeping after three long hours? My lord, I wonder why the fire marshals have not ordered you to clear the doorway of scores of people waiting to be seated. Your food staff had huge difficulty navigating the immense crowd. Think guest safety. When Saturday night crowds are big and it is 10 degrees outside, perhaps you can isolate a better waiting area. Everything about The Cheesecake Factory gets high marks but not your corporate policies or customer accommodation  (therefore the 2 stars as an average for food vs. ""policy"").

You expect consistency and at least passable quality when going to a chain establishment, but not the case here at this location. Wednesday night last week stopped in for a late dinner (9PM) after a long day. The server was great very attentive, but unfortunately the same couldn't be said about the kitchen. Ordered Thai Lettuce Wraps  and my friend ordered a burger - one hour in an empty restaurant to grill some chicken - and plate it with lettuce. Kind of crazy, no apology from the waiter on the wait.  Food finally came out - there were three chicken pieces on the plate - 3 about the size of two of my fingers side by side. - $14 for that? Sauce was missing from the plate and the lettuce was rotting. I wish I would have stopped to talk to a manager, but after a long day all I wanted was to eat and go home especially after an hour wait in a basically empty restaurant.

This was only my second time there but every time I have the hardest time picking out what to get because I want to pick more than one!  We started with Buffalo Blasts as an appetizer and they come with 8 giant pieces! I was shocked when I saw the amount! They're basically fried Buffalo chicken dip and man were they good! With all the food that was yet to come, we probably didn't need to get them, but I'm still glad we did.  My boyfriend and I each got a pasta dish which were very generous portions and both were very very good. My only complaint about the entire experience is that I could tell that my pasta was sitting out for a little while, so I guess we were waiting on my boyfriends meal before they could serve it to our table. It was still good and pasta is always a good leftover choice.  Of course we ended the meal with Cheesecake. We decided to split one and got the cookie dough cheesecake. It was so so so good. In the words of my boyfriend ""I'm glad I've had plain cheesecake before this or I would expect all Cheesecake to taste just like this"". It tasted exactly like cookie dough.

I had the pleasure of taking my entire family (wife and 5 children - 14, 10, 10, 7, 5) plus a 6 yo friend of my 7 yo daughter to eat at CF for my 7 year old's birthday dinner. I realize it was 7pm on a Wed night (not a weekend night), but it was still busy. So - it was crazy, to say the least - loud, annoying, yelling, constant battles between the boys, unnecessary comments and touching, eye rolls and sighs...you know the drill. But CF and my server were FANTASTIC and handled it all with serious grace and professionalism.  Look - the food at CF is good. Very good. Yes, the Factory Burrito is flippin huge and enough for an entire village to eat. Yes, their cheesecakes are absurdly large and delish. Yes, their menu is a bit overpriced, especially some of the kids' meals. But it is truly hard to complain due to the quality of the food. But my issues with CF in the past have almost entirely been about service. Not THIS time, however.  I got there early to get a table (b/c they still have that stupid ""no reservation"" rule, ugh). The Hostess was very nice and went out of her way to help, even making sure my name stayed at the top of the list while I waited for my family to arrive (2 cars). We were settled into a large, round booth-thing. ONE SERIOUS ISSUE - the booth's seat fabric was TERRIBLE. It was literally missing in multiple places with stuffing popping out. Unreal. It wasn't uncomfortable or anything, just VERY ugly and not what I expect for Southpark and the prices they charge. Anyway - our server was amazing. She was constantly there, getting constant refills for my camel-like kids, never getting upset about all the yelling and things being spilled. She got our food out ASAP and was always (somehow) happy to help us with the (stupidest) requests from my children (including needing crayons to color - which she somehow found - and paper).

What made me love this place more besides the delicious food was that the manager (forgot his name) brought out my plate personally and stated it was totally shellfish free. I really appreciate the fact that he took the time to bring my plate out and acknowledge my special needs. We joked around and he was very nice and accommodating. He was awesome!  Now on to the food. I love coffee so I know good coffee when I taste it and their caramel macchiato was amazing. The fish tacos were really good and omg the Mac n chz are a must Have!
