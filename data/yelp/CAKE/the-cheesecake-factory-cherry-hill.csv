Ray D.,"Audubon, NJ",6,13,13,4.0,12/3/2017,"I was here last night on a Saturday in December during holiday shopping season. As expected, there was a long wait, but we were seated before the estimated wait time. The hostess and server were very friendly. The food came out much quicker than anticipated given the hectic conditions. The menu is a little crazy considering the types of food they offer. I don't know what you'd consider their ""specialty"". I got the Spicy Cashew Chicken and it was tasty, so that's all that matters!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill
Prashasti A.,"Philadelphia, PA",152,95,107,1.0,1/7/2018,"Yikes! My family comes to the Cheesecake Factory frequently but each visit has slowly decreased our appetite for the restaurant. The menu changes frequently, each time cutting more and more vegetarian options.  We went for a late lunch and alas, there was a wait. We expected as much.  After being seated, our server came out with water for the table but no straws. I had to actually ask for straws? (Question mark for the incredulous tone of the statement) We were waiting on two more people, so I had asked for the appetizers to be brought out when everyone had arrived but he replied that we would have to wait until everyone was here to order them or we could order them now and he would bring it out when it was ready. I don't think our request was too complicated but still, unfulfilled. After the rest of the group arrived, we ordered out meals.  Because the menu had changed since our last visit, my parents asked for the vegetarian dishes (my mom's favorite falafel salad was cut), and he said they had 3 vegetarian dishes. Now, I don't claim to know the entire menu at the CF but I know for a fact that they have more than 3 vegetarian meals. What's up with that? She decided to order the tomato basil pasta, the vegetarian version. Also, please note that this was an entire conversation, and not a simple Q & A. Our server knows very well that my parents do not eat meat. After some time, he brings the food to the table and doesn't even notice the empty waters. Once again, we had to ask for more water???  Lo and behold, the tomato basil pasta my mother ordered has chicken in it. We flag him down and ask is this chicken? He says yes. He then proceeds to ask if it's ok that the kitchen remove the chicken and bring the same food back. Personally, I was offended that this even happened in the first place. But then he has the audacity to ask if she wants the same meal, minus the chicken? WTF? It would be one thing if she had asked for the tomato basil pasta without chicken but after the conversation where they asked him for a vegetarian menu and whatnot, it was absolutely unacceptable, and he did not even seem apologetic. Honestly, it feels like he was trying to spite us or something because nothing made sense. I know for a fact that this was the Final visit to the Cheesecake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill
Matthew B.,"Monmouth Junction, South Brunswick Township, NJ",1,5,11,5.0,11/19/2017,"Great place to catch up with old friends and split lots of different types of food.  It is avrry busy restaurant so it may be best not to go during prime time.  But you have the ability to walk around Barnes and Nobles and the signal still reaches.  First off, the service was great.  They were kind and considerate.  The server recommended their favorites and they were all great suggestions.  They were capable of answering questions about their extensive menu. Many of the pastas are great choices, but read the description to make sure you enjoy what it contains.  I would recommend the cauliflower apitizer, it will surprise you in both bold taste and melt in your mouth texture.  I would not recommend the cheeseburgers for those who do not like greesy burgers.  The cheesecake is fine, but can be overwhelmingly sweet.  Recommended to share a slice. The pricing is a little high, but to be expected for the location and food portions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill
Natasha B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,18,10,4.0,1/13/2018,"Pretty good. Though there is so much on the menu, and it can sometimes be hard to choose, the food is satisfactory. The atmosphere is nice, service was good, and food was yummy. The food took a little while to come and was a little pricey, but it was worth it.

Bob H.,"Byberry, Philadelphia, PA",50,446,527,4.0,6/17/2017,"I am a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory. It's one of the few chains I will eat at. We were here this past Thursday for an early dinner. I like this location. The server was extremely pleasant and helpful. We started with the crab cakes and the mozzarella wedges. The crab cakes were delicious and packed with crab meat, I actually bit into a shell. The mozzarella was just as good. Very fresh and not your typical fried junk. For entrees we went with the chipotle chicken sandwich and the turkey burger. Often turkey burgers are dry, not this one. The burger was amazing! Moist and flavorful, I did seek a bit of spice. The chicken sandwich was also very good but it was very very large and heavy. The chicken was a bit on the greasy side but hey it's fried chicken. The buns on both were perfectly toasted. We opted for salad instead of fries. The citrus dressing is to die for!  We will be back! 4 stars..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill

Mal S.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,28,16,4.0,6/26/2017,"4 stars for the apps and service. 1 star for the ""Sheppard's pie"". It's not even a pie. Sheppard is supposed to be the sheep not ground beef. It's just beef stew and mashed potatoes on top. It was greasy and the flavor was not good. I just ate the mash potato cause I love mash potatoes but the meat was not the correct meat. Why are they advertising shepherds pie if you're gonna get this trash. It ruined my meal and I left very disappointed.  Don't get this trash food. Cheesecake Factory has very delicious food and the service is excellent so I'm not bashing the company on why it's bad, I'm just ranting on this dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill

I skipped the app and ordered the Crispy Chicken and Shrimp in a sweet and sour sauce. It had mushrooms,scallions, snow peas and cilantro.

Mary T.,"Glassboro, NJ",0,8,5,2.0,9/26/2017,"I really went back and forth with myself over writing this review, but I feel obligated to forewarn other guests. My friend and I stopped here for a late dinner after work on Sunday, and it wasn't as busy as it usually is when I go. We had a wait of barely 5 minutes, and were sat in a little corner.  I totally understand that servers work for tips, and sometimes it's hard not to judge people based on appearance, but this is probably the first time that I've felt that what I was wearing significantly effected the quality of my service. Mistake number one, was wearing jeans and a T-shirt. I felt like we were stashed in a corner to not take away from the overall vibe of little dates and dinner gatherings that were going on around us.  Our server brought us out two waters and greeted us, ran down dinner and drink specials and asked if we'd like to put in an appetizer or get anything else to drink. In retrospect, this was where we made mistake number two. My friend decided to just go with water, no alcohol to bump up the tab, and told him she was gong to have an appetizer as her entree. We asked for a few more minutes, as I hadn't decided on a dinner yet. This was the turning point of our visit.  The soda that I ordered took about 20 minutes to come out, when he then asked if we'd like bread while we wait. The bread took another 10-ish minutes, and the meal came almost immediately afterwards. No inquiry about a refill on any drinks, and we didn't personally have his attention after the food was dropped for about another 45 minutes. However, he was gushing over the table seated immediately next to us, who appeared to be on a date. They ordered alcohol, appetizers, meals and were dressed very nicely. He stopped two or three times to have full 3-5 minute conversations with them, while totally ignoring us. No three bite check in, no refills, nothing. He was consistently present and attentive to his other tables, just not us.  Maybe he thought we were a couple and didn't like that? Maybe the casual, young adult in jeans and a messy bun appearance causes unintentional judgement because we look like we don't tip well? Maybe our not ordering $100 worth of food made him feel as though we were a waste of time? In reality, we were saving room for the $50 in cheesecake that we wound up ordering at the take away counter, because two hours for a quick meal was too long to be there already, and if we didn't ask for the check when we did, who knows when we would have seen him again. We didn't drive 30 minutes to this establishment to be treated worse than a minimum wage fast food worker would have treated us. On top of everything else the bathroom was a disaster. Do better, Cheesecake Factory. This was such a disappointment. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill
Robert O.,"Millville, NJ",53,577,284,3.0,9/10/2017,"There's nothing wrong with this place, but I am not a Cheesecake Factory fan. My daughter and I had dined in one in Baltimore a couple years back.  We were totally unimpressed.  My wife has wanted to go, but after our review, she's been a bit gun-shy.  We visited here when we realized we were kind of trapped in the area for some time and were hungry.   The menu in this place is entirely too large.  There is no reason to have so many selections.  This tells me they want to cater to everyone, but excel at none.  And that pretty much sums this place up. This was a better experience than the Baltimore store, but the food is very generic and nothing I would ever say, ""Hey, you have to have this dish.""  You can visit and find something that isn't horrible and overpay for it.  Other than that, I'll pass from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill

Shaun E.,"Philadelphia, PA",129,113,46,3.0,8/20/2017,"Why am I reviewing this place? Because I need to pump up my reviews. Why are you reading this? Either your sitting in Cheesecake Factory and waiting for your waitress or you're really interested in someone's opinion who you really don't care about. Either way thanks for reading! Stopped by on Saturday around 10:30pm. There was no wait. We got sat immediately. There was a big woman sitting by herself on her phone. To the left of us and a couple making out at the bar. A no name boxing match was on. I will reveal who won the fight (4 time welterweight champion vs some guy, spoiler alert someone got knocked out round 3).  We got drinks. I got a smashing whiskey something. It was delicious. My wife got a blue moon. Drinks came out very quickly. We skipped appetizers and went right in for the kill. Unfortunately even with no crowd the wait time for our food was 30+ minutes. Do not go here if you are in a rush.  I got the steak Diane and chicken medeina which is apparently their favorite dish as a combo. My wife got the chicken parm pizza lol. The calories weren't listed because in sure listing a 3500 calorie bomb should be illegal. Mine was good. Steak was perfectly cooked and the chicken was moist. I like the cheese on top. When the mashed potatoes with the skin were to die for. The waitress never asked if we wanted a second drink. Oh well her loss! When we finished I couldn't find my waitress. We waited another 20 minutes before she emerged. I asked for a check and a box for the remaining 2/3 of the chicken parm pizza (which was essentially a huge patty of chicken covered in pizza sauce with some noods on top).  She asked if we wanted dessert and oh yeah we're at the Cheesecake Factory! I ordered the classic with the cherry preserves with some ice cream. It came out with two dollops of whipped cream! I totally forgot! Too much cream. I'm lactose intolerant. I would regret this choice.  Bill came out to $68. Not bad. If we didn't order drinks we'd have been okay. At least we shared dessert! Still working off those calories. The waitress took another 10 minutes to come over after we finished dessert. She immediately got the check then walked away (should've waited the 3 seconds for me to give her my cc) 20 minutes go by and I finally see her chatting up another waiter. I literally need to waive the check bill in the air to flag her down before she realizes I'm ready.  We leave by 12:10am. Could've been done in 30 minutes but I could never find the waitress. That is why they get a 3 star rating rather than 5. Other times they have been way quicker. The boxer won by knockout in the first 3 rounds. He essentially won before our food came out! Also when we left the big lady was still texting with her empty plates in front of her! Must've been one intense text sesh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill

Austin L.,"Philadelphia, PA",139,55,123,5.0,6/10/2017,"PARKING: Free parking lot outside!! Came here with 11 other friends(not including me) for a surprise birthday dinner after coming from skyzone... so yes expect this review to be more about if me and my friends were filled up! We had balloons which were '18' that we wanted to put on the birthday girl's seat and the employees were very nice about it. We were a big group so I was a little hesitant if one waiter will be able to handle all of us. Starting off with the beverages... I got the Iced Mango Drink($6.50) THIS DRINK IS A MUST HAVE... 10STARS FOR THIS DRINK!! The waiter then proceeded to get the rest of my friends their drinks and their UNLIMITED free bread with butter. Not sure the exact names of the bread but some are white and some are brown. The BROWN ones are the best in my opinion!! Always a fight to see who get the brown one. The wait time was 20-30minutes but it was expected as we were a large group but the unlimited bread complemented the wait time with jokes and story telling between my friends.  The food all came out at the same time which was good because no one wants their food to get cold while waiting for their friend to get their meal. For the main dish I got the Shrimp Bistro($18.50) with shredded cheese on top. AMAZING.... usually people look for the shrimp taste but I rather eat the pasta without the shrimp. The pasta was soooooo creamy and delightful. This has to be the BEST pasta I have every tasted in my entire life. After we finished, the employees sang happy birthday to the birthday girl and handed a Cheesecake to her.  The food did fill me and my friends up... I had to take the left over pasta home. Another plus about this place was the waiter split the check between 12people... they have some amazing employees at The Cheesecake Factory. HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone and highly recommend the Iced Mango drink and Shrimp Bistro to everyone!! I will be back to this place with friends and family members next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill

Frank B.,"Fairfax, VA",0,4,,3.0,9/14/2017,"It was a busy Saturday night so I understand that things will be busy and chaotic.  After an expected 30 minute wait for a table, I ordered the classic bang bang chicken and shrimp.  Being a busy night, it took almost an hour for the food to arrive...but I again understand.  The problem was, my chicken and shrimp arrived SANS chicken!  It was pretty obvious too since the plate consisted of a mound of rice with a few shrimp and sauce.  It was clearly half the normal portion. After letting the waitress know, she was very friendly and offered to correct the issue.  Apparently though, my order went to the very back of the line again since it took about another 45 minutes before I received my corrected order.  By the time I got my food, the rest of my party was finished eating and ready to go.  So let's hope the food tastes okay reheated since my dinner out involved picking scraps of food from the rest of my party.   The manager did come by to say ""Sorry about how long it's taking.  The kitchen is very busy tonight"".  While I don't expect the manager to give free food because mistakes do happen...but ANYTHING, even an appetizer or more bread would have been nice...rather than begging for leftovers from my companions.  The scraps of food I had were tasty though and our waitress was very friendly.   Manager definitely could have handled the situation better considering after around two hours waiting, I never did get to eat what I ordered. Update:  While my experience with this location was lackluster...I have to say that Cheesecake Factory corporate did an excellent job.  The Guest Relations Department with corporate read my review and contacted me right away.  They apologized and asked for additional details to allow them to investigate the problem to prevent such occurrences from happening to others.  The fact that they actually read online reviews and address potential issues is impressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=20
Patty V.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",8,105,130,4.0,6/17/2016,"We always enjoy our visits to the Cheesecake Factory, but I will admit we have to be in a certain frame of mind for it.  It's a very busy, loud, noisy, crowded place and frankly, the noise and chaos grate on our nerves and gives us indigestion.  As others have mentioned, if you go at prime meal times, there is almost always a wait.  This restaurant is steadily busy ALL the time, even on off hours, although on off hours you might not have a long wait.  They don't take reservations, either, which is a pain. On the plus side, the food is very tasty, portions are generous and service is usually friendly and attentive.  I love all the varieties of cheesecakes offered, and the cheesecake is pretty good - maybe a little on the dense/dry side for my taste, but still good.  I think the most appealing thing about their cheesecake is that huge number of varieties available.  One of my favorite desserts they serve is not a cheesecake at all - it is the strawberry shortcake (see my photo).  It's a biscuit shortcake piled high with vanilla ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream and it's the bomb.  Be aware - this dessert HUGE and can easily feed 3 people. I also love the Fried Mac & Cheese and Avocado Egg Roll Appetizers.  For entrees, my favorite is the Bistro Shrimp Pasta.

Priscilla P.,"Morristown, NJ",55,158,96,1.0,7/14/2017,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory location I have ever been to.  I used to love this chain and felt that they had reliably good food.  At the Cherry Hill location, the food was just inedible, restaurant itself was unsanitary, and the bad service did not help either.  My cousin and I came for lunch on Thursday 7/13 at around 3pm.  The restaurant was nowhere near full and it appeared that most tables were available.  We were told by the hostess that it would be a 20 minute wait if we want to have a table with service (??there is an option for table without service??), otherwise we could go sit at the bar.  We browsed around at nearby shops and waited the 20 minutes... When we got buzzed for a table, we were seated in the far corner of the restaurant (awkward spot where there were A LOT OF FLIES!!! EW) and on our way to the table, there were so many empty tables that had not been cleared/cleaned (this could be what is attracting flies? and causing a wait at an off hour?).  I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta... and it was so terrible... it was pasta floating in so much oil that I caught myself SLURPING the three bites that I took!  I ended up just eating the chicken cutlet part of it.  My cousin got an everything pizza... and it looked and tasted like a frozen pizza that was not microwaved all the way! The cheese looked like individual shredded pieces that did not melt... and I heard loud crunching as she bit into the crust (which was not ""crispy"" but more from being stale).  Our waitress was so hard to get a hold of and with all the flies, we were just anxious to get out of there.  She never made eye contact or asked how our food was, just dropped off the check and walked away quickly.  I will not be returning to this location and certainly do NOT recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=20

I luv their mojito's and they have a pretty large selection of vegetarian food. Not, just the typical vegetarian meals, but something that took some thought to create. On this visit, my daughter and I came in an hour before closing. I started with my usual pineapple mojito but ended up with two by the end of the night. I decided it was to late to eat a large meal, so I stuck with the small plate menu. I was craving a Greek salad, and it truly can't be appreciated unless you add extra feta cheese, YUM!! I also enjoyed a variety of fried sticks, that included zucchini, avocado and port mushrooms. All fried to perfection with two dipping sauces, I was in veggie heaven. Overall, this was a very healthy and inexpensive meal. The customer service was great and we opted to sit outside, since the AC was blasting.

Mariella S.,"Camden County, NJ",446,284,4658,3.0,10/10/2015,"The portions are huge not as large as the wait though. I find the menu overwhelming. The bread basket that comes out with a variety of breads is nice especially with the butter. Being the menu is so large I make up my mind and then change it 3 or 4 times before the servers makes it back. The cocktails are not anything special. The cheesecake options are always promising. I love cheesecake so it's pretty hard to mess that up in my opinion. I don't find myself craving the food that often and mostly it's due to the wait the food is not worth waiting 1.5 to be seated. I usually go with the ceasar salad which is HUGE and well dressed. Their margaritas leave much to be desired flavor wise but are pretty strong.  Also, I tried arranging a dinner with a large group and they do not take reservations so I decided to wait the 2 hours they asked me to wait in order to put together a table large enough for us all but then they changed their minds once I arrived and we had to go elsewhere.

Tom P.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,63,9,1.0,8/2/2017,"Was planning on taking my party of nine to have a casual birthday dinner.  I attempted to call early in the week to get a reservation since the party was large, however, they stated they didn't take reservations.  hmmmm... so went there in-person the day of and was told it was over a 1.5 hour wait.  Seriously?!?! So you don't take reservations, and if you come in person you have to wait that long.  One-star for not having weekend reservations set up.  Just because you KNOW that you have enough business to not have to deal with reservations doesn't mean you degrade the customer experience in such a manner.  Instead we went across the street to get AYCE sushi instead and had an amazing dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=20

Allie A.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",84,1854,486,4.0,5/2/2016,"3.5 but I'm being generous. This place is a zoo.  It was my first time ever in a Cheesecake Factory, so I didn't know what to expect.  It was a Sunday and our big family had a lovely gift card we wanted to use, so we tried to be smart and make reservations in advance and come in for an early dinner, but THEY DON'T TAKE RESERVATIONS ON THE WEEKENDS. ""Expect an hour long wait time,"" they said.  So we waited just over an hour (luckily, part of our family arrived early to ""take one for the team"" and get on the list and the little buzzy thing) while we came with my 86 year old mother a bit later so she wasn't too inconvenienced.  The food itself was fine. We ordered 10 different dishes and no one complained. My coconut shrimp curry thing was pretty good. What was over the top, though, was the service. Our waiter was bouncy and energetic and really happy.

Vince S.,"Trenton, NJ",302,589,902,3.0,8/23/2015,"I am not ashamed to admit that before today I was a 40+ year old Cheesecake Factory virgin. I had nothing against the business, but no real desire to lose my chasteness. Now that I am no longer pure, I can honestly say that I can see the appeal this place has on people from all walks of life.  First of all, the decor in this location is quite interesting. We both remarked that it had something like a Disney and or resort-ish effect. For some reason you just feel good, and at ease too. Second, the sheer quantity of choices should be able to appease even the pickiest of the picky. I can't comment on the quality, we were here for dessert only. And last but not least, their namesake option does not disappoint. My friend chose Godiva chocolate, and I opted for salted caramel. What I'm leaving out is that it took us ten minutes to narrow our selection down since the choices are vast. We enjoyed both slices. The tastes were fresh and intense, with lovely plating. Almost as lovely as my desserting companion, but not quite. To sum up, I would recommend CF to families with younguns, or those looking for casual fare with an ending that is sure to be happy. I think people from other cultures visiting the U.S. might also enjoy the experience of dining or at least desserting here. 3.75 sweet cheesy Yelps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=40
Kelly W.,"Pitman, NJ",0,7,2,1.0,7/25/2017,"We are not difficult to please, and this is not our first visit to a Cheesecake Factory. In fact, this is my first negative review EVER on Yelp. However, it's hard to describe how disappointing today's lunch visit was in this Cherry Hill Location. We were seated quickly, as the restaurant was not too crowded. Our waiter, Eric, was friendly when he took our drink order, and gave us plenty of time to study the menu. I did not realize that was probably because time apparently didn't matter to him. We made a simple order--Asian lettuce wrap apps, a macaroni and cheese burger (medium well), and a soup and salad.  Eric left, and two other couples came in and were seated near us. We sat and waited for our appetizer, and time started ticking away. The appetizer took FOREVER to come out, and Eric apologized for the wait. We were fine with that. Then, it came time to wait for the meal. We waited and waited, and watched the other two couples receive their meals. They had burgers and salads too. Their burgers had so much meat that they looked like they did not fit on the bun. Their salads had lots of fresh looking veggies, and their burger came with an abundance of fries on the plate. Eric walked by several times, but never with any food for us. He apologized again for the wait, and left and came back, but still did not have our food.  We had been in the restaurant an hour at this point. Eric walked by again, and I said, ""any luck yet?"" He said, ""Yes, soon."" I said, ""I don't understand, those two couples came in and ordered long after we did, and are almost through with their food. We only ordered soup and salad and a burger. I don't understand the delay.""  Eric left, and the next time we saw him he had our food. I look at my husband's burger. It was half the size of the bun, and look like it was cooked to the point of being a hockey puck. There were no fries on the plate, and Eric said the fries will be right out. Eric lay down my stupid salad as well, the soup looks fabulous but the salad was nothing but greens tossed in a light dressing. I was surprised that there was not even a cucumber or tomato or a shredded piece of carrot in sight.  My husband and I just looked at each other stunned, and started eating. He could barely chew his char-burnt burger that was supposed to be medium well. Several minutes later a table runner brought out a small cup of cold french fries.   My husband and I were quiet the rest of the meal, and did not see Eric again for a while. No asking how the food was, no offers for refills, nothing. He finally showed up, and spoke just one word, ""desserts?"" My husband and I responded simultaneously with a somber ""no"". Eric quietly gave us our check in and we paid and left. To add insult to injury, The cloth table napkins had shed white lint all over my black sport, my husband's shirt, and his shorts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=40

We asked for a table for two. First she said we were standing in the wrong place. She was clearly frustrated. She proceeded to give us a poor attitude. Finally I became irritated and asked if there was an inconvenience? We came in at 9:55pm so I wasn't sure if they were trying to close. She told me they closed at 11. I told her she seemed unhappy that we asked to sit and she responded by saying she didn't feel like being there. Wow... that left me speechless. When we sat down to eat, I'll admit the food was still great. The waitress was nice at first but then became a little snippy when it came to boxing our food. I felt like we weren't wanted there. I would usually chalk it up to a one time thing but i visited there 3 weeks ago and noticed the customer service was declining then.       Personally, I love a friendly atmosphere. I love to tip. But I couldn't bring myself to leave more than the average tip (15%) and I rarely ever do that. In the future, I'll probably love you guys from afar and just buy cheesecake.

While I love going here and just sitting at the Hi Tops and ordering apps and drinks with friends, I find they usually screw up every other time. It's mainly the kitchen, you either get a chef who can cook or you get a chef who just doesn't get it. We never try to customize our food orders because the menu is so extensive that you can find something that fits your palette without a problem. Yesterday after a business meeting we decided to visit CF before heading home. I ordered my usual Basil, Tomato and Cheese flat bread and opted to try 2 new things: the cucumber mint lemonade (amazing!) and the parmesan cheesey garlic bread (fail! There was no cheese at all on there). Sent the garlic bread back and just asked for an order of fries.  Just a note about their French toast for brunch. Just say no! Or go to Grand Lux across the street. Their French toast is horrible. I needed a steak knife to cut it! Not cool! They don't use proper bread for french toast it's more like a hard shell sourdough.

Others needed more coffee, and were complaining about not having enough syrup. There was a long wait for the server to come back, then another long wait for coffee, syrup, and to have my sour tomato juice replaced with supposedly fresh squeezed orange juice. I stopped eating for quite some time, because I had nothing to wash down dry pancakes. The orange juice at least wasn't spoiled, but I have a hard time believing it's fresh squeezed, when my supermarket brand orange juice that comes in half gallon cartons tastes much better.

While Eric was waiting other tables, another server noticed my empty salad bowl and asked if she could take it.   Onto the food.. I ordered a Caesar salad and a lunch portion  of a rigatoni dish with shrimp and sausage. One thing I HATE about a predressed salad is almost no dressing or too much dressing. This salad nailed it spot on.. Just enough without being watery or soggy.  However, this dressing tasted more like mayonnaise with pepper. Wasn't a big fan but a little table salt and freshly cracked pepper saved my soul. Up next was my lunch portion of rigatoni with shrimp and sausage. Pretty tasty.

And yet that's what virtually Everyone comes here for. Seems logical, i know. The decor is nice as usual, but it's getting a bit dated/run-down from all the hordes of patrons. The service is spotty; sometimes you get an energetic smiley server, and sometimes you get an aloof one eager to finish their shift. Once the obscene portions of the food are overlooked, the food is actually pretty good. I am a big fan of non-boring flavors-- bitter, sour, pungent, umami, etc. So that narrows the chain's encyclopedia-sized menu down a bit. I recommend any of the cajun, thai, and comfort-style meat dishes for these types of flavors. Some lemon-based Italian dishes too. I say the comfort dishes (shepherds pie, chicken madeira, chicken & biscuits, etc) due to the umami flavor caused by the jus mixed with the starch.. The Mexican-style dishes are mostly Tex-Mex which are not interesting. Arguably, only a few cheesecakes are really worth getting: purist related. Original, orig. + strawberries, oreo, vanilla bean, white chocolate rasp, & red velvet. That's pretty much it. Nothing too complicated, nothing chocolate-centric--if you wanted to cover up the cheesecake flavor, just get sponge cake.

At that point of the meal I couldn't get the thought of the dead fly out of my mind. The issue was when the bill was brought to our table I was charged for the salad.

I've been to the cherry hill cheesecake factory multiple times.  Now- for any of you who know anything about the cheesecake factory, you can expect a wait when you go during prime times. Off hours the wait time is not bad at all, particularly for late night bites.  Drinks can be a little expensive ( draft beers run ~$8)/ but cocktails are fresh and usually pretty good. The menu is HUGE. You can get jut about whatever type of continental food you would like to order. I feel like I am never disappointed. The staff is courteous and friendly. Your meal always starts with delicious fresh bread (pumpernickel and white). And then of course the dessert, I usually don't even like cheesecake but give in and order while I'm here.

Amanda M.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",373,375,35,3.0,4/16/2015,"What is it about this place that draws ENORMOUS crowds everywhere?  No matter the location, I've never walked into a Cheesecake Factory and been seated without a wait. My recent visit to the one in Cherry Hill was no exception.  Thinking we were ""early"" for dinner on Saturday evening, we were told to expect a 50 minute wait by a very efficient hostess.  Thankfully it didn't take quite that long (more like 25 minutes) before we were seated.  Busy restaurants means tight tables, no matter how big the interior may seem. We were nestled next to two couples on either side, which wasn't too big a deal, although it's always awkward to hear every word of other people's conversation.  I'm always overwhelmed by the mish-mosh of offerings at CF (which seems to match the decidedly un-themed, lavish decor).  This time, I decided to stick to appetizers, allowing me to try a few different things.  We split the fried mac and cheese balls and the crabby bites, which were both delicious.  I then ordered veggie fries (fried avocado, zucchini, and portobellos), which were unfortunately very disappointing.  I've had awesome avocado fries before, but the breading seemed all wrong on these.  Luckily I'd also ordered the pear and blue cheese flatbread, which was excellent - the arugula on top had a lemon-y drizzle that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Despite being stuffed, we couldn't leave without cheesecake, so we ordered it to go. I don't think you can go wrong here, as they're all delicious, but my Adam's peanut butter/caramel/brownie concoction was perfect, and actually lasted two days. Perhaps next time I'll skip the wait and just order cheesecake to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=60

She screwed up my dinner order and while everyone else ate, I waited for my food 20 more minutes due to her ERROR. At least she offered a soup which I declined since it was 92 degrees outside? Who eats soup when it's that hot? By the time my meal finally came out of the kitchen, everyone else was finished the meal. At that point I took it to go.

By the time they brought it the water had gotten cold. The cream had started to turn, and sodas were flat. Total fail). In general, it annoys me that they don't respond to customer requests-- CF policy prevents customizing orders, and if you ask for a meat salad without the meat you still have to pay the full price, despite the fact that they offer few vegetarian salads.

I'm all for crusty, hearty bread but this was insane. Fast forward to appetizer.. delicious! We got the crab wontons, they were fresh and hot and tasty. Now, on to my main dish. Sigh. I ordered the fish tacos and the plate was at-best lukewarm when it got to the table. The ingredients in the tacos were weird. It almost had a sour/bitter taste and the ingredients were piled into the taco so high that it was difficult to pick up and eat. The black beans were salty and the rice that was served with it was so weird. I can't even explain the flavor, all I know is it didn't go with the dish. Should I also mention the tables? They have so many tables crammed in there, when the girls next to us got up to leave their bodies were actually touching our table because there simply was not enough room to get by. We could hear their conversations and I'm sure they could hear ours. I was probably sitting 12 inches away from our neighbors. So much for an intimate dining experience.

The Oreo cheesecake was a chocolate lovers dream. And the cocktails at this place are exceptional as well.

I brought my wife here Sunday night for an early anniversary dinner(seeing on Tuesday i am at an interview) We have eaten at their other location in King Of Prussia and i must say seeing this is the second time.. no complaints.. We had outside seating seeing the weather was Gorgeous and the wait time was 1 min, compaired to 15-20 min for inside dining. Which is common for this place, also its not as cold as it was inside.. felt like a cold box once you walked in. My wife as much as i LOVE her she is always cold.. it could be 85 outside and she can still complain about it being cold.. Don't know its her Latino blood.. but thats besides. The outside was perfect, light breeze, beautiful scenerie.. a look of the stores and how it was lit up by the lights and florals outside. (Not saying inside was bad, that too looked comfortable, easy on the eyes) Our service was great, our waitress was friendly recommended some specials there were doing. They also have a newer menu out its their 500 calorie or less menu(for those of you who want to enjoy the great food, but not to worry about gaining weight)I saw the menu, i looked over it , i must say i was impressed, the meals they had on there.. you wouldn't think they were 500 cal, or less. OK now lets get into the goods...  We started off with some drinks, wifey got the Pina Colada, i got the Pomegrante Mojito.. (very very good) , our appitzers we both went salads, my wife got the veggi salad,(this is one big salad) and myself a Boston salad.. Lets say Boston won this battle of the salads, very tasty, had bacon on it so you know its a winner hands down, shredded and little chunks of  blue cheese and ranch dressing.. I reccommend that salad if you guys like salads..  For our main course, which i gotta say the portions are incredible.. more like HUGE. My wife and i both went with steaks but she had the shrimp scampi with a fillet cut medium, with wasabi mash, and veggies. Looked great , cooked to her likings. Myself i went with the Hibachi steak, medium with tempura asparagas, also wasabi mash, shitake mushrooms in a sweet, but not overbearing sauce.. gotta say they knocked it out of the park with this... Phenominal.  Our waitress did a great job, made sure if we liked evrything, or any problems.. it did get a little cold outside(for my wife) i enjoyed it... but i did ask if she could turn on the heater they have, she did, without any hesitation or surroundings people. I think the wives/gf's around us were also grateful of this..  We didn't get any cheesecake  because we were full , but i know she brought home 2 slices, dulce de leche, and a vannilla bean.. do you think i will get a taste.. ERRRRR wrong lol .

For two weeks in a row, I have shared an app and a salad with the parties I was with and gotten a slice of cheesecake to-go. I ordered the skinnylicious chopped vegetable salad two weeks in a row, and it doesn't disappoint.  One week, my group ordered the factory nachos, which I found mediocre, and the other week, the tex mex egg rolls, which were a hit. One person ordered the four cheese pasta which was absolutely amazing, and another, the black pepper shrimp, which was okay. Their passion fruit martini  and Asian pear martinis are always a hit, and although they are pricey, they are pretty strong, so it is a good deal.

Fooood time! For starters: ' Buffalo wings ' Crispy Crab Bites ' Stuffed Mushrooms The Stuffed Mushrooms had a Garlic and Herbs in a Wine Sauce which was good to dip with the complimentary bread that they gave you. *Side story: About that bread, I love it! The brown one. We even got another basket with just the brown ones. And when we were almost done, we asked for some more so our waiter went and got us a whole fresh roll! I was so excited! Thank you!! So for the main course, we had: ' Cajun Jambalaya ' Shrimp with Angel Hair ' Farfalle with Chicken & Roasted Garlic & some kind of chicken salad with blue cheese. Jamabalaya = ""Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce."" I wouldn't say it was VERY spicy but it was a little. I felt like the angel hair was a bit bland so we mix the jamabalaya & the angel hair pasta and you get a nice new little pasta dish with more taste. For dessert: ' Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake ' Mango Key Lime Cheesecake ' Pumpkin Cheesecake The Mango Key Lime was pretty good. I didn't try the rest but everyone seemed to enjoy it. We'll be back.

Granted, there were a couple modifications to them. However, messing up an order twice is completely unacceptable. The second attempt, the cheese was so burnt that they wouldn't have been edible even if the order was correct. Then, the manager tries to tell me that the item I ordered can't be prepared that way when, in fact, someone in my party has ordered the item that I ordered the exact same way on numerous occasions. I preemptively rejected a third attempt due to the fact that I had lost my appetite during this fiasco. Any other restaurant would have, at least, credited a portion of the check due to their poor execution. I feel I was lucky to get credited for the botched part of my order.

They only take reservations during the weekdays, weekend is first come first serve and that means anywhere from 45-hour and a half wait. We waited hour and a half. Their menu is the size of a library book they offer probably a good 200 items I have been here a handful of times and still always get the same appetizer user after trying a few. Thai lettuce wraps. Huge portion deliscious always. This time I got a bacon date pizza and my wife got the pasta carbonara. I would call this place more of a gourmet diner. Kids are still present its super loud the menu is extensive they offer brunch on the weekends but the food quality does not lack at all. I give four stars bc of the wait times, not food quality although this time I went I did have to send an appetizer back because it had a hair on it but honestly let's face it that happens everywhere.

Their alcoholic drinks are made well. Their dessert is good, but eight dollars for a small piece if cake is outrageous! Not worth it, when it costs that much to make an entire cake. Their food is hit or miss. My friend got fish tacos once and then shrimp scampi, and didn't like either. I tasted a friend's French fries, and they were over salted. That's annoying coming from fine dining. My sweet corn tamale cakes were too sweet and lacked a good contrast in textures - the cakes should be crisp with a crunchy exterior, but they were super mushy. I've found their pasta and salad dishes to be the only consistently yummy dishes. The pumpernickel with oats served right away and warm are a favorite as well.  They also don't put the prices on the menu for the alcoholic drinks...not a fan of not knowing what you're getting for the price. If you're going here, I say stick to the classics. They don't pull off trendy, unique dishes very well at all.

All of the cheesecakes. And surprisingly, Cheesecake Factory also hase some of the best salads. I especially love their Cobb salad and their Santa Fe salad. Be warned if you've never been though because their salads are huge! Imagine the biggest plate of salad you've ever seen...and then double it! Yep, that's about right.  Actually all of their food portions are pretty huge. This is why foreigners have bad impressions of Americans...it's because of these gluttonous food portions LOL. Don't fret--just take the rest home and pig out the next day. Their complimentary bread basket is also something I look forward to...and dread...since I could scarf down the entire mini loaf of honey at bread if someone didn't hold me down.

We met some friends for brunch on Saturday and were seated right away (we got there when it opened - 11am..ideal) and ordered some drinks.  The cafe mocha, a rich chocolate and coffee blend, is one of my favorite coffee-style drinks.  We were planning to start off with our all-time favorite CF appetizer, the chicken croquettes, but were saddened to learn that they had been removed from the menu.  (deep breath) but we had to move on.  It's actually a good thing that we didn't since we filled up on bread and still couldn't finish our entrees. I ordered the breakfast fiesta burrito; loaded with cheese, potatoes, scrambled eggs, chorizo sausage, peppers and onions, stuffed inside a giant tortilla shell and served on top of a very spicy and delicious tomatillo sauce.  They also present it with a side dish of black beans, but I barely touched the mundane additives; I'd ask for the burrito without them next time.. or substitute some fruit.  Either way, the burrito was amazing and I almost finished it, but remembed to save room for dessert. My wife was feeling more lunch'ish and went with the chicken littles (an oxymoron if I've ever seen one).  Her plate came loaded with fresh (easy to tell it's not factory compressed) chicken tenders, mashed potatoes and a corn/zucchini succotash.  The chicken was delicious, especially with the bbq sauce. Our companions chose the same style of entress, one got a hamburger and the other a breakfast sandwich.  Both reported them as tasty. Dessert brought the next round of disappointment.  Maybe they moved it, but they used to have an awesome chocolate cake, layered with chocolate and coconut.  By far, one fo the best non-cheesecake desserts in their repertoire.  It, along with the chicken croquettes, will always be remembered.

When you finally do get a table, settle in, because the menu is TWELVE PAGES LONG. Yes. The food menu....for a restaurant....is 12 pages long. Its like a phone book of food choices. It is an obnoxious amount of choices.  When you make it past your 2 billion choices and settle on something, I hope youre hungry. My little brother got a starter salad, AND GOT THE HALF PORTION, and I think they brought it in a wheelbarrow. Do people seriously eat this much?!

The food is good and the dessert is transcendent. The decor is nice, but spacing between tables is kinda tight. Prices are pretty standard for going out to eat; $10-12 for a burger, and $9-12 for mixed drinks. (Full bar is a plus.) Overall, Cheesecake Factory is a very safe bet.

Kathryn C.,"Woodstown, NJ",87,61,118,3.0,4/13/2014,"My daughter, mother, and I visited this location after a morning of Prom dress shopping at Jan's and the Cherry Hill Mall. We arrived around 1130, just before they started seating for lunch. We only had to wait about 3 minutes for the wait staff to wrap up their shift meeting and were quickly sat a very spacious booth. Our waitress was great and patient as their menu is a small novel! We ordered to much food but it was all delicious... Especially the. Sweet potato fries and nachos. We didn't eat much of our main courses because we wanted to save room for dessert... Opting to box those up for dinner later! Desert was good, my main complaint is on behalf of my mom who cannot eat walnuts. What is with all the walnuts???? I mean, even the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake has walnuts!! So if you have a but allergy just be aware your cheesecake options will be very very limited. All in all, good food, little pricey but a good experience.

First time eating here at this location and I will probably never go back. It was very disappointing and a big let down. From all the entrées ordered, 2 out 4 were okay. The other 2 were nearly inedible. The chicken was burnt, dry and so difficult to chew. Chicken on another platter was served over pasta but on the bone. So gross. The pasta was bland and overcooked. Our server was friendly but very inattentive. We ordered immediately after sitting because we were in somewhat of a hurry. Still took over 20 minutes for our food.

I love their new ""Skinnylicious"" menu, which gives lighter versions of menu favorites.  Most of the time I don't even realize it's been lightened up, since it's still so tasty.  There are also some great lunch specials that won't overwhelm your GI tract too. One thing I was impressed with was our server, (I believe his name was Jeremy?), who was not only crazy friendly, but looking out for us as well.  My mom had ordered a sandwich off of the skinny menu, with a bowl of soup as well... and he informed us that it would be cheaper (and the same exact thing) if she were to order the lunch special of soup and sandwich.  What a guy!  Most servers, I feel, would have just let her go with the more expensive option since a bigger bill = bigger tip.  Two thumbs up! I love, love, love the factory chopped salad (although disclaimer: the skinny version doesn't have bacon.  fail).  I've also had the chicken and avocado sandwich (phenomenal), and the chicken salad sammie (rockin).  I love the pumpernickel bread they bring out to munch on, and I also love that since Momma W. and I both ordered from the skinny menu, he asked if we wanted the bread.  OBV we want it... but it was nice that he was being conscious of our choices.

Thuy H.,"Philadelphia, PA",150,384,227,3.0,5/21/2013,"Came here on a weekend and was shocked on how fast we were sat. Normally, I'd be waiting at least half hour to over an hour, so definitely A+ to that. I had my baby with me so they were also very kind enough to give us a nice size booth so the car seat would fit in with us. Service was excellent! Everything we ordered came out at a decent time. For apps, we ordered mini crab bites and these chicken wonton things. Skip the crab bites if u plan on getting them! Extremely overpriced and they were so tiny. The chicken wonton things (forgot the names) was delicious though. It had a somewhat curry taste to it. For main meals, I ordered fish tacos and my husband ordered this spicy pasta with shrimp. They both weren't that great. I ordered my fish tacos tempura style, but when it came out, it was this heavy fried dough. Tempura is supposed to be light. They should not ask if I want it tempura or grilled. It should be wiuld u like it fried or grilled. If I knew it wasn't tempura battered, I would have gone for grilled. The tacos weren't horrible but could have been better if I actually got what I wanted. My husband's pasta was good, but he didn't like it much. He didn't think it had enough spice to it. He said he remembered it differentially. Upon leaving, we decided to order a whole cheesecake. They didn't have it ready and was completely frozen. I was a bit upset bc I couldn't eat it right when I got home, but once defrosted, it was quite delicious!! Go for the banana cream.

Kelly H.,"Stratford, NJ",23,72,44,4.0,10/29/2013,"Typical Cheesecake Factory. Amazing portion sizes (you definitely get the bang for your buck), extensive menu, and delicious cheesecakes for eat-in or to-go. For $10, they even let me take home a big container of this cilantro sauce there that I am in love with. It comes with lettuce wraps, which are also amazing, by the way. Service here has always been good to me.  I just don't trust the fresh fish here. My boyfriend got the ahi tuna that they had as a special once and had warned me of its mushy consistency and bland taste. The ahi tuna tataki salad caught my eye though so against my better judgement I went against his word and got it. And low and behold, a mushy mess of tuna. And a very bad tummy ache later in the night. I firmly believe you should stick to ordering what the restaurant is good at, i.e. don't get seafood if its not a a seafood place.

I ordered the tomato basil pasta- always delicious. I also ordered an app of tempura shrimp. It said it was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't spicy at all- which was fine with me, but could upset someone else since it is advertised that way. the other person with me had the lunch portion of orange chicken which was done perfectly- portion was way more than any lunch portion should be- perfect for leftovers.

Kathleen L.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,28,12,1.0,4/21/2013,"THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! My boyfriend and I just left the Cheesecake Factory and it was by far the worst dining experience ever. We were seated and only had knives for utensils. Then we ordered appetizers and drinks. Our drink order was right the first time and then after that the server, Nicholas M brought out the wrong drinks - not difficult, we both ordered a diet coke.  Our table was never fully cleared after our appetizers were finished. Then for the really ""great"" part of the night, our meal. After waiting for over 45 minutes (the restaurant was not nearly as crowded as I have seen it before) our food arrives. My boyfriends was right, mine on the other hand was not. I ordered the fettuccine with chicken and sun dried tomatoes. My ONLY request was to have penne pasta instead of fettuccine. Surprisingly enough, they gave me fettuccine.  As my boyfriend finished his meal, mine finally came, this time only about 35 minutes later. Neither time did our actual server bring us our food. I ate about three bites of my food and was so angry that I wanted to leave. I even wanted to have dessert but was so annoyed at how poorly our service was that I opted out.  But wait, it still gets better. Our bill came to $54.84, which another waiter brought us the check, maybe our original waiter saw the sheer look of disgust on my face and didn't want to hand it to us. I wish I could say the mess-ups were over but they continue. Our original waiter hands us the receipt back with our 15 cent change, clearly he couldn't do math since our bill was $54.84, making it 16 cents change. Not that I give a crap about a penny, but at least after completely ruining our evening you could hand us the right change.  Needless to say, this was the worst experience ever.

Picture this: three relatively health-conscious girls out to dinner.  Nobody was trying to get all South Beach or anything, but it was clear that we wanted healthy meals so we could splurge a little on dessert.  Two orders of wasabi tuna and an order of miso salmon seemed like a safe enough bet. Not so much.  My friends' wasabi tuna entrees were really delish, but the wasabi crust had a fried consistency to it-- good for sure, but totally not necessary.  My salmon dish had an absolute river of thick creamy sauce going around the plate.  Luckily, the salmon itself was on dry land, located on top of an island of rice.   I just don't understand why the people behind the menu at Cheesecake Factory think that healthy food has to be bombarded with fat before people will order it.  The salmon was fantastic with just the miso glaze-- and the tuna didn't need such a thick, greasy crust.     Oh, the CF does have healthier selections on the menu.  You'll know what they are because they are listed with the words ""Weight Management"" before each item.  What genius came up with this idea?!  Can I take his or her place on the marketing team when he or she gets fired?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=200

Everyone enjoyed their dishes.  We ordered the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake and the Oreo Cheesecake and shared it.  Also one of my sons ordered the milkshake.  I deducted a star for service because I felt that our server took forever bringing us back the dessert menu and then we waited a long time again for him to take our dessert order.  Considering that it was a pretty slow night for the Cheesecake Factory, I felt that the desserts could have been emphasized a bit more.  I will return to this restaurant again.  The food was good, overall a bit pricey.  Dinner with appetizers and desserts for the four of us cost $173 (inclusive of an exactly 18% tip).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=200

EricaLynn J.,"Elkins Park, PA",387,793,34,4.0,5/20/2008,"I think sometimes people forget what defines a chain restaurant as a chain!  A chain restaurant, even the most high-end ones, needs to maintain its identity no matter where it may be located.  The food needs to pretty much taste the same on your plate as a person's plate across the country.  That being said, The Cheesecake Factory in Cherry Hill is one of the great ones, that stands out from its other identically-dressed sisters.  Why? Because of the x-factors:  the service is usually top-notch, the parking lot is ample, and since any seasoned Cheesecake Factory diner knows that there will always be a wait, no matter what day it is (unless you go for lunch on an off-hour...seriously, try that) it helps that there is a budding shopping center growing around it, that keeps opening up new stores at a rapid pace!   If you're not familiar with the menu, here's the real deal:  you can basically eat any cuisine there.  So if you are in the mood for anything, and you feel like plunking down some money for a somewhat costly meal, head on over, put your name on the list, grab a menu, and find your match.  You wanted Asian? There's a salad and entree that will be good for that.  You wanted Italian?  There's an entire page of that.  Thai?  Go right ahead and turn that page... there it is.  Once you've browsed the menu, go outside and shop!  Or look at some of the interesting people you'll soon be dining with.  This *is* South Jersey, you know.   By the time your name is called, you'll have a fantastic meal planned out and, adding to the mystery of the long wait, your service will be pretty darn quick!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=220

Donald L.,"Mt Laurel, NJ",37,6,,5.0,1/8/2013,"A year ago, on the occasion of our 20th wedding anniversary, my wife and I had a great dinner at The Cheesecake Factory in Cherry Hill. One year later, on our 21st anniversary, we went back. A tradition has begun! Here are my thoughts from our most recent romantic visit. We dumped the kids at the home of some excellent friends, and arrived at the restaurant about 2PM on a Sunday afternoon. Incidentally, though kids are welcome at the Cheesecake Factory, I think it would be hard to enjoy myself there with our 4 kids in tow. Our kids are pretty well behaved, but even still, I'd worry about them disturbing other restaurant guests, and that would keep me from relaxing and enjoying myself. Also, it's a bit expensive to take kids there. Honestly, my kids would be just as happy at the golden arches... We were told our wait would be 20 minutes. Turned out to be only 8. Not bad. That's just enough time to peer into the cheesecake cooler and decide what to have for dessert. (More on that later....) The atmosphere is loud, but that actually works to your advantage inasmuch as the noise level allows your conversation to be private. Surrounding conversations are simply part of the room noise, and that's important since tables are spaced pretty close together. Some reviews I've read complain about the 19-page menu and the insane number of food choices. I personally love lots of choices. Heck, this is America, and freedom of choice is what we love, like one of those inalienable rights! I chose the Sausage and Broccolini Pasta. That was a real winner. Perfect pasta, fresh veggies, good flavor. The dinner portion was a lot of food, but I could handle it! My wife chose the Hibachi steak, accompanied by mash potatoes with wasabi butter and tempura asparagus. I sampled her steak, which was good. But I don't get the idea of deep-fried asparagus. Whatever. Our server was very pleasant and did a fine job. Knowing that we loved that brown bread they serve, I think she included some extra bread in our doggy-bag.  And then, of course, there's the cheesecake. My wife went for the Tuxedo Cheesecake, which she loved, but I took a simpler approach: the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.  My wife commented, (but without a trace of criticism) that my selection seemed a bit ""boring."" Maybe so. I admit to being much less adventuresome.  But for me, I needed purity of flavor at that point. And vanilla is never wrong. Remember that. I was quite satisfied. Based on a fantastic experience of great food and a new yearly anniversary tradition with the love of my life, The Cheesecake Factory is nothing but happiness for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=220

We went here for a special occasion and we were seated immediately; surprisingly,  it wasn't overly packed and/or busy. I did not like our server, Desiree, at all. She had a very flat affect, standoffish attitude, and seemed to pre judge us maybe because we looked young (possibly). I'm not sure, but I'll leave it at that. She walked past our table so many times before introducing herself as our server. We waited patiently and I even went to the bathroom and she still hadn't stopped at the table. She is the worst server at CCF I've had in the past 5 years. Desiree finally asked us about drink orders after about 8 minutes and it took forever for us to receive bread. Desiree may require additional training with serving and cultural diversity. We ordered the Fries Mac and Cheese balls which were scrumptious! For entrees we ordered the Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi and Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp & Chicken (my absolute fav). I rated the visit a 3 only because the food was very tasty. Now that I think of it, Desiree never even asked how everything tasted or if everything was ok. Sadly, I have to change my rating to a 2. She had absolutely below subpar service. I usually order my Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake and eat a little while I'm there and take the rest to go, but I didn't want to increase her tip by anymore because she SUCKED. So I purchased cheesecake at the counter. I usually tip minimum of 20% because I was a former server... The only reason she got over a 15% tip is because I don't believe in not leaving a tip...

The food, though, was very good.  Their portions are HUGE and I could barely finish half of the burger I ordered.  And the cheesecake is out of this world, as it should be, given the name of the place.   So why three stars?  Well, minus one for the close proximity to other guests and the loudness.  But you also have to take into account the price - The two of us got an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert for $75.  It was yummy, but for that kind of cash, you could probably go somewhere a bit fancier, quieter, and non-chain restaurantish and leave a little happier.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, and intend to go back....  But only once, maybe twice a year.  And only after being paid a bonus or stumbling upon extra money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=240

One of the better ones is defiantly The Cheesecake Factory. I usually order the same thing when I go, but my friends order different things all the time. Not once have I or any of my friends ever been disappointed by this particular location. I order the Chicken Romano which is a GIANT piece of breaded chicken with spaghetti and some kind of blush gravy. The chicken is kind of on the bland side, but that pasta more than makes up for it. If you order it, just ask for a little side dish of the gravy and put it right on that chicken! It has an amazingly good flavor that I'm addicted to. The little bread they give you with the oats on top is super yummy and the cheesecake (if you have room after those huge portions) are no joke! They're damn delicious. I usually take half my meal and half of my cheesecake home for lunch the next day. Service is always fast and friendly and the prices are right where they should be.

Try to get there between 10-1030 and there is no wait which is generally NOT the case. They have a brunch menu along with the rest of the menu.

I said, maybe but it's really rather cold now. She rolled her eyes AGAIN so we decided it was too 'chilly' for us, excused ourselves and as we were turning to leave she SLAMMED the menus on the counter. We would have stayed to eat if she hasn't kept rolling her eyes at us... We were just wondering where the warmest spot was. It really is one of those places where they keep it way too cold. I understand the staff gets hot when they work, but since when does the comfort of waiters come above the paying customers.

Jesse I.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",2,8,13,2.0,4/29/2008,"At first glance one may think that the Cheesecake Factory is something more than just another chain restaurant. The interior and exterior is beautiful, from the giant pillars to the hot waitresses--beautiful.  But in all seriousness, when it comes to food the Cheesecake Factory is your average chain restaurant. The food is plated in a lousy fashion most of the time. I mean, with the beautiful atmosphere, I would expect the food to at least look better on the plate rather than just being plopped onto it and given a rushed garnish. The food is very inconsistent, which goes along with being an average chain restaurant. The last time I went I ordered the pasta chicken dish and the pasta was not fully cooked. The menu definitely offers a ton of things, which is good if you are going out with a crowd that cannot decide on what type of food they want. I had a particular problem with one item on the menu--the Kobe beef burger. This is very misleading since it's only called Kobe beef because it's from one of the tough parts of the Kobe beef cows. Real Japanese Kobe beef is illegal to import into the States. Wagu Kobe is domestic, and the good parts of this beef go for around $15 per ounce on restaurant menus. The Cheesecake Factory has average food. The service is good, and it should be since to become a server one must undergo a rigourous written test. The food might be heavenly to a student on a tight budget or with an average palate, but it's below par to a person who really appreciates food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=240

On to the entrees, I got a seafood pasta dish which was okay until I found a chunk of beef in it.  I don't eat beef, or any other red meat or chicken, at that.  And dishes should never be cross-contaminated like that.  I flagged down a waitress, and she wasn't sorry about it.  She took it and later some manager type person came and asked me to tell him what was wrong.  He said things like this ""should not happen"" - well right! they shouldn't! but he wasn't exactly sorry either. They obviously comped my dish, but for the rest of everyone else's stuff, consisting of either deep friend appetizers or pasta ala oil, the charge came to be much more than it was worth.   The only halfway redeeming quality of this restaurant is obviously the cheesecakes.  Which are pretty good and packed well to-go, since we didn't want to spend anymore time there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=260

Jacquie B.,"Toms River, NJ",35,11,2,1.0,3/11/2014,"So disappointed in my visit yesterday.  I've been to the one in Freehold many times, this was my 2nd time to Cherry Hill.  Ordered my favorite dish that I've had at least 5 or 6 times over the years at Freehold - the Wasabi Crusted Tuna.  It's one of the higher prices meals at $22, but so worth it.... But NOT yesterday.  My mother was with me & we both ordered the tuna.  Server was pleasant & attentive, very nice.  Wasn't a long wait to be seated or to get our meals.  It was early - just before 5pm (body clocks at 4pm with daylight savings) - so it was not busy yet.  Meals came & the tuna (which should come rare - as described in menu & how it's always been when I've gotten it before) was cooked well done - I'm talking the look of canned tuna well done!  It happens, our server sees, apologizes & brings both dinners back.  Manager comes over apologizes & says he will assure our meal comes out correct.  Not too long a wait & our waitress is back - the tuna now has BARELY touched the grill & is completely raw & cold - not cool/room temp, like I've ALWAYS had it before, where it has a nice sear on both sides, but red in the CENTER - nope!  Red Raw all around the edges.  I could not cut through it with my dinner knife raw! In the past I've worked at fine dining restaurants, and I know the kitchen can get pissy when food is sent back.  Like it's a personal insult.  I really felt like the Raw Tuna was an FU to us - ""these bitches want rare?  I'll give 'em rare!""   No, what I wanted was it how it is suppose to be prepared!  How I've had it so many times before!  Someone should really get ahold of their staff with attitudes!  Allow me to enlighten the average restaurant patron on something... MOST patrons will take this out on their server - who has NO control over the asshats with egos in the kitchen!  Those very asshats get an hourly wage - they get paid no matter if you like your food or not.  But your server, who bears the brunt of your frustration due to receiving two plates of ill prepared food, gets yelled at, gets the complaints...and usually in the end - gets a crappy tip!  You know they only make $2 -$3 per hour, heck 20 years ago, when I waitresses, I made $2.25 per hour.  They depend on tips! But those asshats in the kitchen get minimum wage at least, most get more!  It's WRONG!!! The waitress apologized again, took the food.  I was over it!  Tried not to take it out on her, I ordered a dinner salad.  Great ""dinner"" at Cheesecake Factory"" - NOT!  Manager came back, apologized, offered to have asshats in kitchen make it a 3RD TIME.  No Thanks!  Spit comes with a 3rd dish, or a swipe on the floor before it hits the grill - I worked in restaurants... I've seen it happen!  I tried to explain this concept to the manager about retaliative kitchen staff(I didn't call them asshats to him), but he replied, ""well, I don't know what kind of restaurants you worked in before, but it's not our policy"". Yeah, NO KIDDING!  It's nobodies policy!  It's the asshat in the kitchen of your upscale CHAIN RESTAURANT, who thinks his mistake is my problem to choke down.  It's his inflated ego, thinking he's actually a ""chef"" who knows how to create new & flavorful, delicious gourmet meals...when in reality, he is a connect the dots ""cook"" - take meat A & add premade sauce B, cook for x minutes with C cooking method - dump on plate!  That's why it's always been good when I had it in the past!  Follow 3 or 4 steps - comes out exactly as it should!  My guess is someone didn't pay attention to the ""x minutes"" the first time - but PURPOSELY under cooked the second time... To show me!  I just wanted it done how it was suppose to be done!   So my mom ate 1/2 her raw fish, saying - I like sushi, and I've never had it before...so I don't know the difference.  Well, I like sushi too...but I didn't order sushi. The waitress got tipped on a dinner & a salad (but they didn't charge me for my salad), even though she technically did the work of waiting on us twice & brought us 4 dinners... So you see, she lost out - her pay was docked....but the ASSHAT in the kitchen will cash his full paycheck on Friday!  It's just wrong!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=180

Nik K.,"Newark, NJ",0,49,13,2.0,9/13/2015,"Visited cheese cake factory in Cherry Hill because we had a $100 gift card. I remember when there used to be only one cheese cake factory in the area, and that was in King of Prussia. I used to love visiting this chain. However, the quality has gone down significantly. During our most recent visit we ordered the firecracker salmon appetizer, which was pretty tasty, so we were excited to get our entrees. I ordered the jambalaya with white rice (instead of pasta). My boyfriend ordered a special pesto tilapia which came with mashed potatoes, tomatoes, in a pesto sauce. He liked his entree. Mine was below mediocre. My entree arrived and looked like chicken, tomatoes, shrimp, with peppers, and onions on a bed of rice. There was absolutely no spice at all. If I had a stomach virus, I could have eaten this entree with no problem. It was bland, unseasoned, and just a big plate of nothingness. I asked our waitress for extra sauce. I was told it would take a few minutes. A gentleman arrived 10 minutes later with a bowl of hot liquid with more tomatoes. Great, is what I thought until I poured the alleged sauce over the jambalaya. I tasted the entree again and was met with the same disappointment. More blandness with even more tomatoes. I finally asked for a to-go container so I could take the entree home and fix it myself. I sat while my boyfriend finished his food. The waitress returned with a to-go box and never even asked if we liked our entrees. I'm pretty sure she didn't really care to hear what we had to say. She was more interested in offering desert. Needless to say, we spent $97 out of the $100 gift card and don't care to return to this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=180
Sok P.,"Philadelphia, PA",6,11,26,1.0,4/17/2014,"Arrived at 830, 10 minute wait, that wasn't bad. Placed order at 850. Now it's 930. That's ridiculously long, server told me my fish and chips order ""was not to his or her liking, so it had to be remade"" not too happy after the long wait.

Nicole G.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,2,3.0,9/27/2013,"The food here never disappoints. However, my 3-stars is for poor service. The waiter seemed overwhelmed. My husband and me had to constantly remind her to bring our drinks, napkins, utensils, etc.  She kept forgetting to bring things that we had asked for. As one example; I requested extra sauce for my side order of calamari but of course she forgot to bring it. This happened about five different times. I understand the place was packed (t was a Saturday evening and our wait time was 40 minutes). However, that is never an excuse to be incompetent. I love the Cheesecake Factory. It's really the only chain restaurant that I like to go to but I prefer the one located in the King of Prussia Mall. They are always crowded but their SERVICE is always GREAT!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=180
Shellie W.,"Philadelphia, PA",16,24,4,4.0,8/27/2014,"Always delicious and food coma inducing, just like it should be! Went with a party of 9 for my birthday and they told us that they don't take reservations after 5, so a table large enough to accommodate us may not be available. Pretty weird to me! However we did get a table, had a great server, and a great time. Best part is, I have enough leftovers to enjoy it AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=180
Scott K.,"Haddon Heights, NJ",1,2,1,1.0,10/6/2014,"Absolutely inconsistent and disgusting.  I ordered orange chicken which I've gotten before at a different location.  This order was nothing like I received in Atlanta.  Half of the pieces had sauce on them, burnt at the edges, crunchy and stale.  Worse representative of orange chicken I've ever witnessed.

Laura C.,"Bangor, ME",0,2,,2.0,9/12/2014,"Food was awesome and was immediately seated.  The service however, sucked. The service was so bad that we asked for our check and to take our food to go shortly thereafter being served.  We wanted dessert but didn't wanted to be waited on the said sucky server so we just went to the to go counter and took our dessert home.

Nicole G.,"Berkeley Township, NJ",4,17,1,3.0,6/2/2014,"First time ever eating at a Cheesecake Factory. It was good! My daughter and I each had a Little Caesar Salad (not on the menu, our server Quentin told us about it!) and we shared the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip and the Buffalo Blasts. Portions were very good, especially the ""little"" salad, it wasn't little at all! Quentin was very attentive and friendly. Large menu to choose from, a bit overwhelming. Unfortunately our food was so filling we didn't have room for cheesecake! Maybe next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=180
Rizwan A.,"Philadelphia, PA",82,199,32,5.0,8/24/2011,"That's right- I gave the cheesecake factory 5 stars. It is exactly as the description for 5 stars says- as good as it gets. This is my idea of a perfect restaurant. Affordable, GREAT food, great ingredients, great desserts, tons of booths, so many different kinds of food, great for any occasion, great service, and tons of locations.  First of all- I have never been to a place where out of 500 entrees, every entree has been delicious. Not only that, but whether you get American, Chinese, Mexican, Thai, etc etc, it is actually made really well and rivals any restaurant of similar ethnic food. The Guacamole here is some of the best I've ever had. If you think that's a joke, go try it for yourself. If you still don't believe me then you just don't know guac. The nachos are also great. The avacado egg rolls, the southwest egg rolls, and calamari are pretty great too. Some people are all about the bread- I don't see how it's so amazing but I do like it anyway. Another thing I love- consistency. I can order the same entree any any cheesecake factory all across America (and I have) and it tastes just as good anywhere. Same thing goes for the cheesecakes and the entire menu. The portions are huge, I usually end up taking food home.  Some of my favorites (including everything above): 1. Baja tacos 2. Green Chile Cheeseburger 3. Chicken and Biscuits 4. Thai Style Chicken Pasta 5. Key Lime Cheesecake Everything here is awesome. Hands down- my favorite restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=180

Anna F.,"Charleston, WV",1,5,,5.0,8/17/2014,"I was so surprised that the Cheesecake Factory has the best veggie salad I've ever had and a fabulous veggie burger!  So if you are a vegetarian, you can eat here and leave full.  A burger is still a burger but it's meat free!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=180
Karen F.,"Media, PA",2808,3911,7,3.0,8/28/2009,"The food was surprisingly really GOOD for a chain and the decor was nice enough.  Service was good as well - but the noise level?  Deafening and the place was loaded with kids - mine included. The veggie salad is great - and it's enormous - 2 of us shared it easily with leftovers. And for $7 a slice - the ginormous piece of Red Velvet Cheesecake (sooooo good) was enough for 3. This was (shockingly) my first EVER visit here - and I really liked it.  Not a healthy place, as Michelle C. says - but tasty grub for sure and not too pricey.  (Save for the cheesecake.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=180
Mini P.,"Society Hill, Philadelphia, PA",61,42,84,5.0,11/5/2013,"Yes its a chain restaurant but by far, one of the best chain restaurants out there! I have only been to the location in Cherry Hill. The wait time is always ridiculously long and everytime  we ridiculously wait! The restaurant itself is huge! It has some pretty interesting decor to look at as well. Huge romanesque pillars with touches of egyptian architecture really make this place look exotic but it has a more casual, warm and inviting feel. The menu is vast! I never know what to get which can sometimes be good and bad! I like the creativity and thought behind all of the menu options. They have everything from mexican to italian choices with all american dishes as well! Pretty much whatever you have a hankering for, I am sure you will find it at TCF. Besides all of their yummy choices, they are more known for their cheescakes! Every cheescake combination you can think of, I am sure they have it! Im a simple gal so I always go for the plain cheescake topped with strawberries and whipped cream which is always oh so good! When I am feeling a little naughty, I go with the red velvet cheescake! Ultimate yum! Everything is well priced and the portions are HUGE so you might want to share with someone. Service has always been above and beyond! Even though the wait time is long, once you are seated everything comes out promptly! I really love this place! If you must chain, link into this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-cherry-hill?start=180
Alyssa T.,"Kensington, Philadelphia, PA",0,3,1,5.0,3/3/2013,"I am never disappointed when I come here. I've gotten the filet mignon, which was butterflied and it was DELICIOUS.  They serve you a roll of some kind of brown bread (honey wheat, I want to say) and white bread, the brown bread is SOOOO good. Every time I go, I get the crab bites (tiny crab cakes) as an appetizer, it comes with a delicious dipping sauce. If you go, try a sour apple martini.
