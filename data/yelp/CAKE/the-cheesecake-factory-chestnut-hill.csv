Bob L.,"Boston, MA",69,80,587,4.0,8/8/2017,If you've ever been to a cheesecake factory then you'll know precisely what to expect. Service was pleasant though not anything special (they were prompt in refilling our drinks which I always appreciate). The menu is huge (normal for cheesecake factory) and is also littered with ads which doesn't really bother me.   Overall if you like cheesecake after your meal this is the place to go since they have me huge selection! Ironically the only real complain is there listing of the calories in each dish since the meals can be ridiculously high in them (ignorance is bliss!).  Ample parking here!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill

Julia L.,"Boston, MA",71,5,23,5.0,11/14/2017,"Great place to grab lunch or dinner after shopping. Many options, plenty if tables, rarely a long wait. Love the skinny menu options.  Plenty of options for kids. They also have outdoor sitting which is nice in warmer weather. The only complain about todays lunch - don't bring kids meals while they are extremely hot. Its very difficult for a parent to try to make a small child wait while the plate is right in front of them.. its unpleasant experience for a child.. keep it on the kitchen for 5-10 min if kids plate is untouchable with bare hands.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill
Paul S.,"Newton, MA",923,257,247,1.0,12/4/2016,"Took my Son & Wife here for my sons Birthday. Not very happy with this place. Thought the portion to price ratio was off. Our portions were just average. I expected more from a higher end restaurant like this.  Our table wait wasn't bad. But our wait person was awful. Our drink order taken the wait person came back & accidentally split a drink on my Wife. I know accidents happen but the drink spilt all over her new coat. Not Happy! We didn't order any appetizers so we just ordered out meals. They came out in roughly 35 minutes. thought it was a bit long.  Our food tasted Great, but like I said our portions weren't that impressive. Could have gone to Panera Bread or the Olive Garden and could have had much larger portions for less money. But my son wanted to come here for his Birthday. Our wait staff person never came to check on us. When we were ready to leave we had to flag down a wait staff person to wrap up our left over food. The Person took our food. I ask for a slice of Cheesecake to go. The wait person said they would be right back. We waited roughly 20 more minutes. We flagged another person down they said I will be right back. The person came back only to tell us our Leftover food had been thrown away... Plus no Cheesecake either.. We paid in Disgust & Left $80 spent & it was a Bust.  Also we realized that after we left we were never given our Dinner salads that was supposed to have come with our meals & no bread was brought to our table. Needless to say I won't be going back to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill

Kimberly A.,"Boston, MA",326,376,,5.0,3/27/2017,The service here is friendlier than any Cheesecake Factory location that I've ever been to. There was absolutely no wait to be seated unlike the Braintree location which is in a bigger and busier mall and there is usually at least a short wait there. I wasn't in the mood for much so I ordered the nachos. They came out perfect and I really enjoyed them. My server brought out a bread basket for me to munch on while I waited for my food to come out and the bread was very delicious and freshly baked. I'll definitely hit this place up again on my future trips to the shops at Chestnut Hill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill

Jon G.,"Branford, CT",6,54,,5.0,9/2/2017,THIS IS JUST REALLY HARD FOR ME TO EVEN SOMETIMES PUT INTO WORDS HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS PLACE! The staff are extremely friendly and it's definitely worth checking out sometime especially if you live within walking distance of this place in one of the Chestnut Hill Apartment Complexes! So I'm not a cheesecake person myself but the Linda's Fudge Cake MY WORD IS SO DELICIOUS! You have to try this whether or not it's the first time you've been to this place!

Angela S.,"Boston, MA",119,117,173,3.0,11/5/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always one of my favorite spots to go because their menu is endless and their food is pretty consistent, however my experience this time wasn't as great.  Came here on a Sunday night with a group of 7 people. The hostess said there will be a 45 minute wait, but we only waited for 15-20 minutes (so that was a plus)! We got seated in a booth, couldn't fit 7 people so the hostess had to put an additional chair in the middle.  The reason I gave three stars is because I felt really rushed. Once the food came, I think halfway, she already offered us boxes. I can't even remember if she ever offered us to see the desert menu. I thought that was unprofessional and rude! I can't even enjoy a night out without being rushed! Shame!  The food here is good, like I said, pretty consistent. Some of my faves that I think are worth trying are:  Shrimp scampi  Louisiana chicken pasta  Cobb salad  Renee's special  Burger",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill
Judith T.,"Boston, MA",1,40,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Called not once, not twice but three times to place an order for pickup. I was supposedly transferred to the cashier each time but each time after waiting for 5 minutes there was no response. I don't mind waiting and it wouldn't have been a big deal if they'd at least acknowledged that I was waiting. Needless to say we ordered from another restaurant. Not sure if we will be ordering from here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill
Eli s.,"Brookline, MA",0,87,,2.0,5/2/2017,"Food was as expected. It tasted, you know, pretty good. Flavors were definitely there. Portion sizes were shockingly large. For example, my mother got a main dish that she shared with three other people at the table. We then brought it home and had a dinner for two the following night. That means two things.  1) what quality meat are they using if the can afford to make close to 6 portions out of one $13 dish? 2) cheesecake factory is unhealthy Cheesecake slices range from ~1000-1600 calories per slice. That is also unhealthy. Now, if you add an appetizer and a drink to your meal.. forget super size me.. you wouldn't last a whole month. Cheesecake factory. Get your act together. Make your portions healthier (smaller). The skinny menu is a good start but your core menu has to be healthier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill

Lizzie S.,"Boston, MA",0,17,5,1.0,8/2/2016,"I ordered a salad for lunch, one that I like to order at other Cheesecake Factory locations, expecting it to be really good. Instead, I was served a pile of lettuce with a few tiny shriveled up pieces of asparagus that looked like they had gone bad and I could not taste any dressing. I at least wanted to ask for more dressing or other edible/fresher toppings, but our waitress was nowhere to be seen - she didn't serve us our food and didn't ask if everything was ok. It was not busy in the restaurant whatsoever, so I can't explain why our table was neglected.  My fiancé had ordered the lunch pizza and it tasted like a bad frozen pizza. We were both disappointed to say the least and wished we had eaten somewhere else. Our waitress eventually appeared with the bill (over $30), but she put it on our table so quickly and left. We didn't even have a chance to tell her about our experience.  ***If I had seen the yelp posts (a few posts down) about someone finding glass in their food and seeing mice running all over the floors, I definitely would not have eaten here in the first place.***",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill
Chiraag B.,"Boston, MA",74,60,68,4.0,8/30/2016,"Stopped by at this cheesecake on the spur kind of moment - plenty of parking outside the mall so always convenient. We didn't have a wait and service was also pretty quick. We ordered 3 apps for two of us - spinach and cheese dip, chicken pot stickers and Tex Mex Egg rolls. As always HUGE portions so we couldn't finish everyone. The chicken pot stickers were wonderful - nice tangy taste to them. The other two apps were ok - nothing to write home about - we were in and out within 30-45 minutes.

House gin martini was well-made. Attentive service too. Décor seemed unusually dark. One surprising no-no:  the bill had the usual three suggested tip amounts up to 20%...but the tip calculation was based on meal + taxes. Come on.

Vivian C.,"Boston, MA",126,1440,14550,5.0,8/11/2014,"This five star rating is for the newest addition to their cheesecake line up - the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake. For the longest time, to me, dessert at the Cheesecake Factory meant their luscious and light banana cream cheesecake.  But now, finally, there's a serious contender for my precious tummy real estate and dessert calorie count - the smooth and sweet lemon meringue cheesecake... yum! There are worse things to be troubled with than which terrific slice of cheesecake to order! *** 10/2014 visit *** Come here for their terrific honey wheat bread, which is particularly good when served warm, and some delicious cheese cake.  If you need something else, consider the Hibachi Steak $19.95 ~ Certified Angus Hanger Steak with Shiitake Mushrooms, Onions, Bean Sprouts, Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and Tempura Asparagus.  Sure the meat portion was rather light on my plate, but what meat there was was cooked medium rare as requested, tender, and so tasty with the sweet marinade. The chicken was tender and tasty in the Chicken Madeira $17.95 ~ Our most popular chicken dish! Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes.   Although it seemed the smallest plate at the table, which was also graced by the pretty layered Luau Salad ~ Grilled Chicken Breast Layered with Mixed Greens, Cucumbers, Green Onions, Red and Yellow Peppers, Green Beans, Carrots, Mango and Crisp Wontons with Macadamia Nuts and Sesame Seeds. Tossed in Our Vinaigrette.  The Famous Factory Meatloaf, Served with Mashed Potatoes, Gravy, Grilled Onions and Corn Succotash was pretty good, though higher accolades went to the variation at Rox Cafe. Entrees rate a 4 here. Annoyingly, they don't seat you till the whole party is there. *** 10/2015 *** The warm crab and artichoke dip app $11.95 was pretty good.  The eggplant parmesan rounds surprisingly arrived alternated with breaded and fried mushroom caps.  The Hibachi Steak $19.95 was still quite good and well worth ordering. For lunch a number of their menu items are available at a luncheon portion for a price that topped out at $14.50 for the salmon vs $18.95/$19.95 .  But consider your appetite.  The DC who ordered the dinner portion of the Luau Salad was the sole member of our party to finish their meal (not inclusive of the one who ordered the mac & cheese burger $13.50). For birthdays, if the birthday boy/girl selects a dessert, they'll decorate the plate.  If no dessert is selected, they'll bring out a scoop of ice cream with whipped cream and embarrass him/her with the staff singing a birthday song. *** 10/2016 *** HUGE Apple Crisp dessert!  Generous for 2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=20

Tina B.,"Needham Heights, MA",0,6,2,3.0,6/21/2017,"The night started off fine with a drink at the bar while waiting for an outside table. Also if our waitress  wasn't such a delight this would be one star review. We ordered a salad , and two ribeye steaks , our food did take a little longer than usual to arrive but we were enjoying our conversation so we didn't mind too much. A ""manager"" came over to apologize that they have run out of ribeye steak -seems odd to say that now it's been 45 mins and the kitchen is just making our food now? Hard to believe. No worries my friend wasn't upset she ordered the filet , rare. The manager or whoever she was comes back to tells us she wants to bring the other steak out and salad so food doesn't overcook, okay fine. Our waitress comes by and sees we're missing a ribeye and wasn't told of the kitchen mistake. Very disappointing that the lines of communication at this place are in total disarray. The real reason no ribeye, it went to the wrong table. How frustrating. And what's with the lie? Put on another ribeye. Maybe they did run out. Oh! During said chaos we gave our compliments to the male manager on duty about our waitress, she tells us he told her we said she was weird! Totally wasn't what we said!

Laurel C.,"Hartford, CT",0,4,,1.0,9/3/2017,"We've been here many times and had minimal problems with this place. But this time, when we came for Sunday brunch, we were completely taken aback by the rude and indecent service. The receptionist at the front (who we found out was named Emma) led us to a seat at the bar area, and not just the bar area. It was the darkest, most concealed part. Not to mention we had two kids and we found it very inappropriate that out of all the seats available at this time of day she led us to such an indecent seat. When we voiced our complaint to her and told her we wanted to sit at the terrace, she led us to, again, the very edge of the area and the darkest place possible. At that point we were fed up, and made a specific request to sit at a table at the center of the terrace, and the look she gave us was extremely rude. We asked to speak to a manager, and her explanation of what happened was completely ridiculous. She made an excuse of ""Here in Massachusetts it's alright for anyone to b seated at the bar."" We've been living here for over seven years and my father is an attorney and knew what's he said was complete bs. Then she tried to explain why we were placed at the very edge of the terrace. ""Every area is sectioned off to each server, so we wanted another server to be able to serve our costumers."" That one was also pretty ridiculous. Of all the times we've been here, nothing like this bad ever happened. We even considered leaving the restaurant altogether since we were so done with this place.

I ordered sliders for food, and was constantly pressured to order more food, even though their sliders are essentially 3 overcooked (despite asking for PINK center) mini burgers with no toppings and bun that came out of a plastic bag a few minutes ago. While I was waiting for Burger King delivery from their kitchen, I was treated to ambivalent service from our waitress who pressured us for more food, but kept forgetting our drinks. I also had 2 bloody mary's which tasted 'skunky' (not sure how you do that) but I suspect their tomato juice went bad and overall it was a terrible experience. The fact that it was sunny out and I was in good company saved the experience, but despite the fact that we were the only people there, Cheesecake Factory managed to screw up something so basic as Sunday Brunch in suburbia. The only redeeming quality about this place is that you can observe suburban russian jewish girls here, discussing #firstworldproblems and talking about their plans to marry a financial analyst that went to brandeis and their plans to go get drunk in Boston.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=80
Lauren L.,"Fall River, MA",48,176,12,4.0,2/15/2013,"Well, I'd never been to Cheesecake Factory before, but my boyfriend thought this would be a great Valentine's Day dinner location. Yeah, him and about half of outlying Boston, apparently. We got there around 730 and were told it would be roughly a half-hour wait to be seated. Taking the initiative, and because I was excessively thirsty, we made our way to the bar and self-seated immediately at a four-seater high-top with a view of the Minnesota/Wisconsin game. It took a while for a server to find us, but that's more than excusable on a holiday. Our server, Rachel, was a gem. Funny, informative and very attentive, she was always in the periphery if we needed her. We started with a chocolate martini - not on the menu, but they'll make it for you - and a Long Island iced tea, plus waters and the quintesential bread basket.  Head's up to the bread baker, and I know they have one because I saw a guy walking around with a giant platter of breads, but that is the hardest, least palatable Italian loaf I have tasted that wasn't on the clearance rack at Stop and Shop. The multi-grain was fantastic, though, and we devoured it before our apps. Word to the wise, this is an amazing date location. We shared a Boston Cobb salad, which was well garnished and portioned appropriately to share. We then had the Hibachi steak, and OH GOD, can you say perfect medium rare? The best temperature for a skirt steak, which I know it was, but hey, cooked with that marinade the cut was great. The wasabi mash, tempura asparagus and roasted mushrooms were perfect. Delectable. Amazing and fantastic, and we have half of it in the fridge because there was just so much. We got two slices of cheesecake to go, thanks to Rachel's suggestions. Coffee and the end of the basketball game were compliments of the manager, whose name I never got. A very pleasant, smiling lady, and I appreciated her attentiveness. This business is in the Atrium Mall, and while the rest of the structure is vacant, I hope they stick around. First visit but not the last!

Tuna avocado salad was tiny, but good and fresh. Salmon firecrackers were a little overcooked, but good. Mini carb cakes where very cheesy - yes cheesy - where is the crab meat? Calamari were okay, albeit unremarkable. Red velvet cheesecake was to die for. Their tab water is filtered and drinkable.  Knock though - club soda was unbearably loaded with chlorine. I sent it back and got a new one. I told waiter David that it is not fit for human consumption and asked for more regular water instead. I still was charged $3 for the soda.

When we arrived we were told that there was going to be a 15-20 minute wait, and we ended up waiting for 40 minutes. When we were finally seated it then took about 10 minutes for our waitress to even come and take our drink order. When she took our drink order it took about another 15 minutes for her to then bring them to us. By the time she returned we were ready to order both our appetizers and entrées. Our food took about 30 minutes to come out, and when it did it was lukewarm, and very dry. Our waitress barely came over to our table to check in with us, and when she did she would forget things that we had asked her for. After the horrible meal we ordered dessert, since that's what The Cheesecake Factory is mostly known for. After ordering it then took another 20 minutes to receive our already made desserts. This may have been some of the worst service and food I have had at any Cheesecake Factory. We walked in at 2:10 and didn't finish eating until 4:45 due to the horrible service.

I checked in at the front desk and told them i had reservations....for 7:00PM. I was told it'll be a 30-45 minute wait. But wait...don't we have reservations why would we have to wait? Apparently no one at the front desk knew Stacy had made this exception. And finally when Stacy did realize we were there and checked in....we've been waiting for a good 20 minutes already. 7:20...7:30...7:45..8:00....we did not get seated until an hour after our FAKE RESERVATIONS! This is unacceptable. A table of about our size gets there at 7:45 and they get seated before we do. Terrible! Either take reservations or don't! Because my family would've happily went elsewhere and made REAL RESERVATIONS so we didn't have to wait an hour to eat. I've had bad experiences at this specific location before and normally they offer complimentary slices of cheesecake to make up for it, but we didn't get didly. It was my grandmother's birthday atleast send out a special slice for her! nope nada. Don't come here unless you have time to chill at the cheesecake factory. Plan to spend an hour waiting to sit to down and then another 30 minutes for your food, and then another 30 minutes just trying to flag your waitress down for the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=120

Keith C.,"Cambridge, MA",19,25,2,4.0,1/6/2008,"I was intending to review their location at the South Shore Mall in Braintree, but since it wasn't listed there and was too lazy to create a new listing, I decided to post it here (where I've also eaten).  Here goes. For someone who tends to be skeptical about food quality at a restaurant chain, this place has impressed me with a consistently good meal at three different locations.  This last time (Braintree), I was told it would be about a 35-minute wait, which was accurate to the minute as I waited at the mall's bookstore. They have a very extensive menu, as evidenced by the fact that the server came by three times before I finally decided upon the California Cheesesteak.  Despite the restaurant being packed, the food came promptly (right after we finished eating the bread).  The meal looked so good that the people around us asked what it was, and although they didn't order it themselves the taste definitely lived up to the expectation: Fresh, not greasy, and just the right combination of steak, cheese, onions and peppers. This tends to be the status quo from the other times I've visited (I think the cheesecake speaks for itself), so I'd definitely recommend going here, just try to pick a time where everyone else doesn't have the same idea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=120

MY ONE complaint, is that he manager was pushy, rude, and tried to take over the waitresses responsibilities and make her look like she wasn't doing her job. It was so bad that i put in a complaint. I can't handle men thinking they can be totally rude and domineering over female staff, or any staff for that matter! it ruined the entire night to have that cloud of superiority on the dinner table.

Rick S.,"Newtonville, MA",1,77,,2.0,8/25/2014,I have to say that I do not see the fawning praise people give the food at The Cheesecake Factory.  My wife and I went here for brunch and found the food mediocre and the service below average.  Our orders were taken promptly and things went down hill rapidly from there. My eggs were moderately warm.  They probably would have been served hot if the server/bus person hadn't walked around the restaurant for 3 to 5 minutes trying to find our table.  Someone couldn't give them a table number??? The next big issue was that I received my toast both dry as dirt and burnt as did my wife.  I had to ask twice for butter which resulted in us getting 3 slices of butter.  I did not realize The Cheesecake Factory was so hard up that they couldn't butter toast and tried to prevent customers from doing so.  Our waitress reappeared at check time but was sorely missed when we needed her!

So now you know that this place is one of my guilty pleasures.  I mean, you can't offer me Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, or on this visit, Caramel Pecan Turtle cheesecake, and expect me to resist.  This was my first time with the Turtle, and whoa was it freaking delicious.  I am sure it's one of the worst things for you to eat, but hey, without stuff like this what's the point of living?

Becca M.,"Boston, MA",13,22,4,2.0,5/4/2014,"Last minute get together with my brother and tonight I just did not feel the ""welcome"" from beginning to end. Got here at 9PM and the host gave us an option to sit where ever so we ended up sitting at a high top table and was served by Shane. He seemed pretty rushy and observing what tables he had I could understand he had a big party full of guys and a couple high tops (including us) and a few booth tables. He took our drink orders- I had the peach smoothie and my brother had the tropical smoothie. DELICIOUS! He brought out bread, but it was missing the sour dough white bread and I didnt really like the wheat brown ones and was pretty disappointed and noticed the next table that came in had both. Another server had brought our drinks over since it was sitting at the bar counter for about 5 minutes. Our server then ran over while our drinks were being placed down and the way he asked what we were going to order I felt rushed. He didn't ask us if we had questions or needed a few more minutes, more like ""What have you guys decided on for food?"" Uhhh ok.  My brother already ate so he just ordered loaded potato tots and I ordered the chicken alfredo. When the food finally arrived, once again the same lady ran our food and I'm just confused as to why is she catering to us? Might as well have her serve us then? His big table was pretty much done and I see him attending to his other tables and to our right there's some staff that is either on break or just ended their shifts and I see him chit chatting. Dont get me wrong, I understand y'all had a long days work and barely had a break, but work is work and its rude to ""neglect"" your guests. What I am the most upset about was when he came over to check up on us and I asked our server if he could pack the rest to go, his response was ""Sure, but did you want me to bring a box for you to pack it yourself?"" Wow. Speechless. As a server myself that IS horrible hospitality. First of all, what did you really do throughout our whole entire visit? 2 second table visits for the max 5-6 times, did not run any of our food/drink, busy attending ""more important guests"" (pretty much 3+ more guests because their table equals more tip?), and chit chatting. Just because its only 2 people with almost $40 worth of food, you don't think we are worth your time? That's how we felt the entire time here tonight. Tipped him 15%, but I felt he didn't even deserve that percentage due to poor service and it annoys me how servers automatically assume whatever the check total will be they think they will get a minimum of 20% gratuity off it. Shane was nice, but his service needs some improvements and not just asking to take our orders and checking up here and there. I shouldn't have to pack the rest of my food when I go out to enjoy my day off from doing that to my own guests!

Janina T.,"Boston, MA",21,108,1,3.0,4/19/2011,"I've generally had decent experiences at this particular Cheesecake Factory. This past Sunday was a tad bit unpleasant. Our waiter seemed friendly enough to start with. After we got our drinks and bread, however, it took SO. FREAKING. LONG for him to come back and take our food orders. I would say it took him a good 10-15 minutes to come back. On top of that, it took maybe 20 minutes to bring my food out which consisted of two appetizers; one was edamame. I didn't know that they planted the pods out back and waited for them to grow, because at the rate they were going, they might as well have. On the whole, I always enjoy going to Cheesecake Factory--their chicken caesar salad hits the spot every time. This time however, every time our waiter would leave, he would take years to come back, even to process our check which, in my opinion, is usually the fastest process since they're ready and willing to take your money and have you out the door.

Jen B.,"Tewksbury, MA",72,44,3,3.0,1/11/2011,"Pros - huge menu, large portions, excellent service Cons - Typically long wait time I have been to The Factory both in the Burlington location and this location. I have to say I prefer this locations service and ambiance. I had the Carbonara pasta the lunch portion which was plenty and my friend had the mini pizza and the beet salad. Everything was delicious and filling. We had a slight mishap with a salt shaker that was not filled properly and the top came off spilling salt onto my friends pizza. This was quickly rectified by the wait staff by bringing her another pizza. Also I have to say that the Manager also came over to make sure everything was ok. All in all a great experience. If anything could be improved upon it is the way they do the seating. If you have a buzzer and it goes off this should automatically mean that you are going to be seated right away. This should NOT mean that you will be put in another line to wait to be seated.

Kevin F.,"Belmont, MA",6,3,,2.0,4/26/2014,"Food was fine. I got a chicken quesadilla.  Great. I ate two of four pieces and left a bunch of salsa, sourcream and more than half my guacamole on the plate. I then made what turned out to be a big mistake by letting waiter box the meal. I figured it was pretty obvious that when I get something boxed to go, I'd like everything I paid for in that box.  If its on the plate, it goes in the box. Low and behold I get home and I have two triangles of quesadilla, yet nothing to dress it with. I don't keep guac in my fridge sorry. Nor do I have fresh pico de gallo laying around. Usually have sour cream, but naturally, I don't now. When somebody asks you to box their meal, put everything in that freakin box. That seems obvious to me but maybe my expectations are out of whack, I don't know. I do know that I'm home and hungry and disappointed at how miserably plain my quesadilla is about to taste.

Yes, the wait is long, but what can you expect with high demand? It's not like they drag their feet. At least they're accurate. Thirty minutes means thirty minutes. And for personal tastes, well, they really don't make a food bad. (For example, these are the same people who would rate a Blonde Hair Dye as terrible because it turned their black hair into an orange. Haha, I've been reviewing too much lately...) I've enjoyed many of their entrees. The meatloaf is a bit funky, but then again who makes better meatloaf than a mother? The cheesecake is great, and I am not the biggest fan of cheesecake. My personal favorite is the Pineapple Upside-Down cake, it tastes more like party cake than a cheesecake. The drinks are AMAZING, and damn fast. The bar is a fun area to be, and most of the bartenders are pretty cute. ;) I think the environment is great. Relaxing when you don't want the chaos of a TGIF bar. The Egyptian decor is charming.

Rachael M.,"Dallas, TX",238,447,109,3.0,12/30/2009,"*sigh* Did I really come to Boston to eat at a chain restaurant?  Apparently so.  In my defense, I was eating with some locals who love the place, so that has to count for something, right?  That's what I'll tell myself anyway... This Cheesecake Factory is pretty standard in most aspects: there is usually a bit of a wait, you get decent service, fairly comfy booth seating, and a wide variety of dishes from which to choose.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table on a Saturday evening (around 6ish), so it could have been much worse.  Upon being seated, I noticed how large this restaurant is - definitely bigger than any other CF I've visited before.  Our waitress was sweet and helpful, though a little slow on the refills.  I'm sure she was swamped with many other tables, so it wasn't a big deal.   For dinner, the people of my group ordered all kinds of meals, all of which were massive in size.  I tried out the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which always looked yummy, but I never had an occasion to order them.  I definitely was not going to starve with this plate - even the lettuce was oversized!  But it was oh so tasty.  The chicken was cooked nicely and had a good flavor to it, though a tiny bit tough.  I loved the variety of dipping sauces, especially the peanut sauce which I'm a sucker for usually.  I enjoyed the fresh veggies even if the bean sprouts did keep getting stuck in my teeth.  Attractive, I know ;)   After all of that, I was stuffed full, but who goes to CF without at least looking at the dessert menu?  Kudos to the waitress for pushing the menus on us... She clearly knows how to make a sale.  I decided to take home a slice of the Pineapple Upsidedown Cheesecake for a late dessert, which totally hit the spot.  It has to be one of my favorites that I've tried thusfar *nom* Overall, this CF wasn't too shabby for a quick meal.  It was in a good (re: convenient) location & our time there went smoothly.  I certainly wouldn't be opposed to visiting this location again sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=100
E W.,"Newton Centre, MA",6,1,,1.0,10/12/2014,"We had the worst restaurant experience last night. I am still mad after ""sleeping-on-it"".  We took my daughters and a friend to dinner last night.  We got to the restaurant at 6:30, sat at our table at 7:30.  We ordered two burgers, a pasta, a salad, and a steak dish.  While we were waiting for our food, the waiter dropped off 5 pairs of chopsticks for us, which got us all confused since we don't see any of our food will require chopsticks.  That to us, was racism (as we are an Asian American family) disguised as service. I am really mad that my kids had to encounter this. After complaining to the manager, he immediately took the blame and offered us a small gift card to apologize.  He said some other table in our area asked for chopsticks, but we can't find anyone around us who would have used chopsticks for their meals. When the waiter came back, he took the chopsticks away without saying anything. We got our food at 8:30 and my medium steak was so burnt and dry that I can't help but think it was revenge. When the waiter came back and asked how everything is, before I could get a word out, he said 'That's great"" and left.  So, should I go back to this restaurant again?  If I don't, the waiter probably had gotten his wish and he doesn't have to serve 'us' again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=100

The last time I went there was a couple of years ago with my sis and it was quite a baffling experience. We were seated quickly and given menus. However, although we saw a waiter attend to all the customers immediately around us, he never once came to my table. My sis and I waited 45 minutes for service, watched the people around us being attended to, while we were blatantly ignored. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I will say that the only difference between us and all the patrons around us were that we were the only visible minorities. Anyway, I spoke briefly with the manager about what the rules of his establishment were in terms of who could be served and who could not be. He gave some insincere apology about what happened to us and offered to send gift certificates for us to return. It was pretty clear that he couldn't care less about our experience and in fact we never saw those gift certificates.

The food was good but our waiter didn't know how to split up the check and we waited 45 minutes while he tried to do it, over and over again. Finally we settled up and our party was short $5. I told them that after waiting almost an hour to be rung up we were wondering if we could just call it even, and they FOUGHT us on it .  I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO GO THERE AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=140
Mary H.,"Boston, MA",7,7,,3.0,7/5/2011,"the good thing about cheesecake factory is their huuge menu, large portions and excellent service i think the only downside was a typically long wait because the restaurant is so busy! everytime i go there is a long wait for a table.

Elizabeth K.,"Frisco, TX",4,37,,4.0,12/14/2008,"love the Cheesecake factory.  The one in Natick is probably my favorite due to the size (very spacious).   The Ahi tempura rolls are top notch.  As are the Avocado egg rolls.  Their cobb salad is one of the best out there and the lunch portion is large enough to feed two.  Their portions are just enormous.  Wasnt so crazy about their chicken club, the chicken was too thick but everything else I  have had here is great.  The decor is realy pretty I think, very Californian, I disagree with one of the previous people saying it was cheesy, its not very New England but not cheesy. It is a breath of fresh air compared to all the family style dining around MA. They have great drinks and of course desserts.  The tiramisu is great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=140

Hope L.,"Brighton, MA",0,7,,1.0,3/1/2011,"My friend and I were super excited to go to Cheesecake for dinner, since we have had great experiences at the one by the Prudential in Boston. When we got there, we waited for 5 minutes at the host stand, before being given the ""1 minute"" finger. The restaurant was empty..but we were seated at an awkward 4 person table in the middle of the room. When my friend asked to switch to a booth, she was told everything was ""reserved"". Sidenote: All the booths were empty for the duration of our meal. Our waiter took 5 minutes to come over to us. And another 10 to take our order. Salads reeked of fish and were DROWNING in dressing. We ordered Sweet Potato Fries- Mcd's style with too much salt. Also, the ""fried mac and cheese appetizer""... I thought I was at Cheesecake Factory, not Sonic. We were thinking about dessert, since we were just SO disappointed with our meal and didn't want to leave on a bad note. But after waiting for him to bring the dessert menus for another 20 minutes, we decided we needed to get out of there. We got a cheesecake at the bakery counter- Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Oh, and no mention of the fact it was full of pecans. The music was WAY too loud, the crying baby ruined the appetizer, and our waiter was just creepy with a retainer.  Almost makes the 12 dollar parking at the Prudential location worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=140

April K.,"Newton, MA",170,339,122,4.0,6/28/2014,"Sure, it's a chain restaurant, but it's still really good. They have a million things on their menu so it's easy to accommodate everyone. Food is good and portions are huge. We got the spinach artichoke dip and it was incredible. Prices are really reasonable and the decor is nice.  The only thing that was lacking was the service. Although our waiter was super nice, he seemed to skip all the details. He brought us our drinks without straws, and he forgot the cream and sugar for my coffee. He also took a very long time to come around to acknowledge us. I don't mean to sound petty, but these are little things that we shouldn't have to ask for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=40

Michelle C.,"Douglas, MA",91,138,41,4.0,3/31/2015,"Nothing wrong with CCF if you go during the week or any other off-peak dining times.. Nothing worth waiting any real length of time for. Consistent, way too big portions.. but if you can sneak in before dinner time you can get a lunch sized portion of most of their more popular dishes. The spicy chicken chipotle pasta I had today at $12.95 is a good deal. I still had half of it to take home. At $17.95 for the dinner size it's a rip off. You'll get a pound of penne vs the 1/2 pound you get before 5PM. And it will need salt regardless of the time you have it. Service is always decent, moody hosts and servers here & there but that happens everywhere. The clientele in this particular location can be a bit ridiculous so I do consider that...

The female seemed  to have no idea what she was doing. She was completely useless...I can't stress this enough! One of the so called hostess was so arrogant and rude.

David T.,"Revere, MA",0,18,2,1.0,11/20/2015,"Nothing is worse than sitting in a restaurant and seeing multiple mice racing across the floor. Actually, what might be worse is the restaurant manager we spoke to telling us she knows about the mouse problem and they ""are working with the mall to find a solution to it."" Seriously? The manager, who was very apologetic and friendly, said that the mice were coming in through a mall door but assured us that the kitchen was mouse-free and and extremely clean. Even one of the waiters told us he wouldn't eat in the area where we were sitting at because of the mouse problem. The restaurant should be closed down until you fix this problem.

We shared the avocado eggrolls, really good! Then I had the Chicken Madeira, which was also great. Think I order the same next time. My boyfriend enjoyed his turkey burger. As dessert we ofcourse ordered some cheesecake (cookie dough and 30th anniversary) and took it with us. Min: we had to wait for our turn and the waitress didn't ask us if we wanted another drink or some water. I also like if  they clean the table after the main course when it's dirty.

Hillary M.,"Boston, MA",65,243,2,4.0,9/9/2015,"I'm happy to report that the wait wasn't long at all and the food and service were both as great as I've come to expect from the CCF. The waiter was cheerful and very accommodating and the layout was perfect to maximize table space but still let you have a private convo with your dinner guest. It was a little weird to be in the MALL during a dinner out, especially when Uniqlo's giant display TVs are still showing wonkus visuals the whole time you're eating. I suspect this is only an issue at certain tables. I have no idea why, but I've encountered some seriously disgusting stuff in CCF bathrooms. This place lost one star because when I reported the grossness in the bathroom to the hostess she said ""oh, you mean that thing in the handicap bathroom? We're working on it"" and DUDE, you should've gotten that taken care of ASAP. Blech.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chestnut-hill?start=40
East Coast C.,"Boston, MA",4,40,,2.0,11/19/2015,"This review is not about the quality of the food, but the service. This location is highly disorganized. When you order takeout, which I do frequently, they ALWAYS omit something from your order: napkins, silverware, bread, sauces that go with your order, tomatoes, the list is endless, It is so difficult to have to open and check EVERY order.

The menu is endless and you can pretty much try something different each time you come - that goes for appetizers, entrees, and cheesecake. They have other desserts too, but I don't see why you would come to the cheesecake factory for something other than cheesecake. The only major problem is their waiters need some extra training. They can be a little slower than expected sometimes, but I experienced one of the bigger mistakes last night - he forgot my onion rings that were part of my entree and when I asked about it, he didnt even apologize. That's probably the only thing that me from all the times I've been.

I thought maybe it was me so I let it go. Then the waiter came and asked if we wanted bread. We said yes, normally they bring the 3 peices of bread. Maybe this place was different then she brought 2 pieces of bread for 2 people so I was like oh I guess they give the amount of bread to match how many people. But then they sat a guy with kids on the opposite side and didn't ask if they wanted bread just placed it and brought 3 peices of bread. I felt so uncomfortable. The only reason that I gave them 2 stars was because the feruchini Alfredo with chicken was good but wouldn't come here again. Maybe they don't see many Hispanic people.
