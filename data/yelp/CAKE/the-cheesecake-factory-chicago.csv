Justin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",70,199,3755,5.0,8/23/2017,"Who doesn't love a good cheesecake after a pizza dinner? At least that is what 4 out of the 6 of us thought after we enjoyed a Chicago style pizza in Avondale, Illinois. We hopped in an Uber and ventured to the Magnificent mile to walk to the Cheesecake Factory at the John Hancock Center. Once there, we drooled over the selections in the display cases as you walk in. We went to put in our name and they had a table ready for us at 9pm. We ordered some cocktails and waters all around. After perusing the extensive list of 33 types of cheesecake and 9 other specialty desserts we made our choices. We ordered the Original cheesecake ""The one that started it all,"" the Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple, the Reese's peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake and last but definitely not least...Craig's Crazy Carrot cake Cheesecake. We all sampled each other's so people could try cakes they had never ordered and only two of us could finish the cakes. Thank goodness for togo containers!  Always a 5/5 for the cheese cakes and the service was exceptional and very attentive 5/5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago
Jonna N.,"Chicago, IL",129,148,450,1.0,1/2/2018,"I went for the first time for my birthday dinner and it did not sit well in my stomach. We waited 45 minutes and spent most of that time in Water tower killing time waiting. I knew I would have to wait so I wasn't bothered. When we walked back in near the hostess, a busser asked us if we were just 2 and sat us down near the kitchen. So we didn't have to wait more. That was nice to be seated so fast. We got bread, drinks and our food in a timely manner, but halfway through eating my food my stomach hurt and I had to run to the bathroom. I got the bow-tie pasta with chicken and it did look greasy. I wouldn't go here again. I avoided the cheesecake, too. I didn't have an appetite to eat it. For birthdays, they only decorate the dessert cheesecake plate with happy birthday and you don't even get a discount or free cheesecake. Not worth going to again. I should have avoided this chain from the start.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago

S K.,"Queen Anne, Seattle, WA",0,14,13,2.0,10/20/2017,"Dinner started well. Table of 4.  Sodas. Ordered. Good.  Food was brought out. One person got a burger, but server said 'fries on their way'. Later, server came back and said, 'fries coming'.  Then server never came back. We flagged him down and asked for a refill of Coke Zero.....but they ran out in the time we'd been there.  Never came back to refill other drinks. After we were ALL finished eating, server brings fries. My friend said, 'it's too late now. I needed them with my meal.  Please take them back.'  She suggested they comp her meal b/c she had a plain hamburger and promises of fries, but no luck in the 40 min we were eating. It really did set a negative experience.  Server came back and said no comp, but could have a piece of cheesecake.  Not a great solution for a diabetic.  Service was terrible.  It's like they're always busy so they don't care if you're happy or if you come back.  Luckily they don't need our business.....because we're not going back.

Aaron R.,"Chicago, IL",12,45,85,1.0,9/30/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory on Michigan Avenue is really something. Don't get me wrong, having a nearby Cheesecake Factory with its massive menu and variety of food can really come in handy to quench whatever your fix is at any given moment. Unfortunately, I came here with my wife and nothing about the experience was delightful.  After being seated we didn't get bread, we asked for it, three times, to three different waiters and eventually got it. I waited over an hour for my food to come out. The manager said only a few more minutes, which turned into 20 more. When the food finally came out, the teriyaki chicken was undercooked and filled with crunchy tendons, gross! This was not farm to table...how about frozen dinner to table, anyone? Ultimately, the manager did everything he could to rectify the situation but the damage was done. I know the restaurant can get quite busy but a restaurant must, always, do their utmost to be attentive to their customers and, follow through with what they say. I ended up getting the chicken pineapple salad, which was pretty tasty. But again, I really can't get over the lack of quality service here, much room for improvement!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago

Sure the wait time can be unpredictable but after a while you kinda know when it's peak time and when it's not. With that being said my cousin and I went on Monday, National Cheesecake day, with the intention of trying the funfetti cheesecake and to catch up. I decided on another flavor which was absolutely exquisite and my cousin tried the funfetti one and she really enjoyed it. We also had meals. My cousin had the chicken parmigiana sandwich and it looked pretty good, she said it was good. I had the beef pit dip sandwich and it was REALLY good. The bread was soft, the au jus was good and the meat tender, flavorful and plentiful. Our waitress was attentive even though it was crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago

Sabrina S.,"Chicago, IL",85,61,240,2.0,12/15/2016,"I really wanted two slices of cheesecake for my birthday tomorrow. Since we were only two blocks away and I have my final tomorrow, my boyfriend and I decided to stop by today to get them.  The cashier wasn't friendly, or welcoming. She was blah and like a robot doing her job. She could've been nicer. But whatever, maybe she was there all day? They gave me a crumbled slice of cheesecake, and the other was a small slice. When my boyfriend asked the cashier about the slices, Paola, the cashier, said ""Maybe this one"" and took the slice that wasn't crumbled and exchanged it for a slightly bigger piece. My boyfriend spent nearly $20 on two small pieces of cheesecake, and there wasn't an apology or understanding or anything. The lemon raspberry cheesecake is ehhh. Do not recommend. The bottom was a little soggy and while it has an acceptable lemon flavor, so does the raspberry sauce on it. Could've tasted the actual raspberry part of it more. 1/5 The white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is bomb. We get it every time we stop by. The raspberry and white chocolate work amazingly together, and while the raspberry is a bit tart, the flavor really comes out. 5/5 The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is why they're getting two stars.

I loved it when I was vegetarian and would order the Portabella burger and the Japanese eggplant burger and STILL LOVE IT.

Bring your patience as there will be screaming kids. And you can expect the food and dessert to be just like any other Cheesecake Factory.

Event just going there for a slice of cheesecake is a fun outgoing where you won't leave hungry or disappointed. All of their dishes and drinks are delicious Unfortunately I had to update my review. We recently ordered delivery from here and I got my go to which is the barbecue chicken salad. On the receipt it clearly reads no tomatoes ( THATS IT). In this $16 salad, it's missing the avocado, apple, and bacon. I've had this salad numerous times and know what comes in it. Safe to say I'm extremely disappointed. Also, there's little pieces of tomatoes. WORST PART! It's missing the crunchy onion rings on top. This is more like a McDonald dollar menu salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=20
Ga Hing C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,83,420,3.0,10/21/2016,"Let's start with the good part of the review first.  I love their complimentary bread. Distracts me from thinking about when the ordered food will come. We ordered the Luau salad. Let me tell you something, that salad was GIGANTIC AND DELICIOUS. The portion was good enough to share with 2-3 people. The second dish we ordered was the Chicken Picatta, it was good but a bit too sour for my taste (had lemon in the sauce).  As for appetizers, here comes the bad part of the review. We ordered the portabello, zucchini and avocado fries and the blue cheese pear flatbread (Pear blue cheese flatbread?). I expected shaved pears on the flatbread but instead there were this huge chunks of pears which made the flatbread disgusting or maybe it was the taste of those chunks of pears. I took all the pears out and it was a bit better. The avocado zucchini and portabello fries, they tasted pretty good. It was hard to tell what I was eating but my mom had an incident with the dish. She took a piece and started chewing and few seconds after I see her face change and pull out something from her mouth and seconds after a second thing from her mouth as well. She found TWO pieces of wire (one was probably 5cm long and the other one was 1cm long). We were all shocked and immediately called the waiter. I was so upset because it happened to my mom and if she swallowed those pieces of wire it would have been a bigger deal. I informed the waiter we found two pieces in the food while she was eating it. He called the manager and she spoke to us. She told us she knew exactly where they were coming from (fryer baskets).  The mananger kindly apologized and offered us complimentary dessert. We didn't want to make it a huge deal since my mom was fine and it was only the shock at that moment and a lot of customers sitting around us noticed the incident, so we took a piece of cheesecake and left things that way. We asked if the item could be removed from the check since we barely touched it and her response was ""of course, absolutely. I will take care of that"". When we asked for the check... THE APPETIZER WAS CHARGED! It was probably miscommunication but we told the server that the manager clearly stated that we were not going to have to pay for that appetizer. The server took care of it and we tipped him accordingly since the whole thing was not his (or the manager's) fault.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=20

Sandra S.,"Toronto, Canada",5,57,106,3.0,5/17/2017,"The only time I have cheesecake is on rare occasions when I go to the US. This was one of the occasions. My husband and I ordered the lemon and raspberry cheesecake as well as the ultimate red velvet cake cheesecake for take away to eat at our hotel room. The cheesecakes were good, however the red velvet cheesecake was a little too sweet for my taste. The other one was also sweet, although the sweetness was balanced by the slightly acidic raspberry coulis it was served with. Flavour-wise I give the cheesecakes 3.5 stars. For a really really delicious 5 star cheesecake, check out my review for Texas de Brazil! When it comes to the service, the guy who took our order, I believe his name was Juan, was very nice and friendly. He happily answered any questions the customers had about the different cakes and also came with suggestions based on your preferences. The service is a clear 5 star rating.  Although the awesome service brings up the rating, I would like to base this review on the food experience alone, which is why I give it 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=20

I have not been to cheesecake since I have lived downtown ( 2 years or so). but I woke up in the morning and all I wanted was a chicken caesar salad from the Cheesecake Factory, and now it was my mission.  I came for dinner with a friend on Friday and it wasn't super busy ( we were expecting an hour plus wait) there was a table ready but we opted in for sitting in the bar. We sat down and started looking over the cocktail menu and then our waiter popped by. He helped us out narrow down our decision. I ordered the Blood orange Margarita ( without sweet and sour). I was not a fan whatsoever it was way too sweet for me so for my second drink I went with the safe choice of champagne. We were ready to order pretty much right away because we were starving. I ordered the appetizer chicken ceasar salad and my friend got the sliders with fries. I know the menu is extremely overwhelming with all of their options but I typically order ONLY the chicken caesar or the miso glazed salmon.   While we waited we noshed on some yummy cheesecake factory bread. the second best part to their caesar salad :).

You know, because that's what they're named for. It took over 20 minutes for someone to speak to us, then they said they'd rush the kitchen for us since we'd been waiting. They brought out a brownie sundae with almost frozen brownies that were stale tasting. It was horrible. We sent it back and said we'd just take the hot fudge sundae. By the time we got it we'd been in the restaurant an hour! And it was utterly mediocre. How do you screw up a $9 ($12 with tax and tip) hot fudge sundae? Well, start with a tiny, tiny amount of hot fudge smeared on the glass to make it look like a lot.

He looked at us and continued talking to the hostess. We just left. It was really bizzare. I felt like I was in a parallel universe. It just ruined the evening.

Harpreet S.,"Irvine, CA",6,6,,1.0,7/9/2017,It is pathetic place. We were first placed a table that could fit just 2 people and then when we got the table it was highly unhygienic. The person cleaning the table used wet cloth with no disinfectant and then he used the same hands to give us cutlery. The table also had wet spots.  We went with 2 kids and we were told there was no kids menu and they served my kids with adult glasses.

Thomas T.,"Chicago, IL",47,125,,3.0,5/2/2017,"Well, it's the Cheesecake Factory. If you were looking for a very unique dining experience, this isn't it (although I've yet to receive a definitive answer on the vaguely anthropomorphic decor. Is it mushroom-inspired? Turkish? Honestly so many of the big wall coverings look like giant tongues and elbows and whatnot). The steak is always good. The cheesecake, without debate, is excellent too.

I don't get the whole concept of it. Our waitress was super nice but she had so much tables to attend she nearly came to check ours. I went with my husband and my younger to celebrate his 10th birthday, you will think an over priced place will at least give a free dessert for the birthday boy!, nope you had to buy the stupid cake so they can sing happy birthday. Our waitress told us they don't t do anything for birthdays at least you buy the cake -_-. I think if we are paying $15 per plate at least they could be nice about it and give him something. After she gave us our check she came out with a Sunday for my brother, ok that was nice of her but it was a slap on the face. There was no nearly any ice cream and it's was topped with lots of heavy whipped cream.  Now that's what you call cheap, my brother even started to cry when he got that nasty ass piece of shit ice cream. Now for the food I had the meatloaf, it was good but a bit salty, my younger brother has the pizza now that was the only good thing of the things we order. My husband had the burrito it tasted like chipotle not good sigh!!!! We had a nasty experience will never go back!!

Carla was mine and my friend's server she's really friendly and always checked on us if we needed anything and she was also very fast with getting stuff situated.

Mark G.,"Montreal, Canada",52,638,23,3.0,8/3/2016,"My 3-star review is an average of the best and worst in one sitting.  Our server, Andrea, was new and very bubbly (in a good way). She was attentive to my daughter and to me and did her best to provide excellent service.  We were seated outside, and were served within a reasonable amount of time. The food was alright. My daughter's kid's meal salmon looked excellent and cooked perfectly. My pork chop took a bit longer and was tough.  Mid-meal, with a young child, it is only normal to go to the bathroom. As we were seated so close to a public area, I took my kid and my bag and we went inside the restaurant. We were gone for 4-6 minutes, and returned to see our table had been cleared and set for the next guests. The restaurant was no longer full though!  I went inside to share this news with the hostess whose first comment was ""it's because you didn't leave any personal belongings"". Ummm.. of course I didn't. It's a big city.  Manager was called over by our server and he was nothing but polite and apologetic. Pure class and professionalism. Not only did they comp the meal (naturally.. who would pay for something they didn't get to finish) but also re-fired a new chop for me and threw in 2 pieces of cheesecake for the road.  Moral of the story: sometimes, mistakes are made, but what's important is how you recover from them. This manager won me over despite an unfortunate situation, and it is to his (and the restaurant's) credit.

I've always been a fan of their pastas, specifically the Pasta Da Vinci (Sautéed Chicken, Mushrooms and Onions in a Delicious Madeira Wine Sauce Tossed with Penne Pasta and Parmesan). Cool to see that their menu looks relatively unchanged for the most part. More recently I tried the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce), and it was delicious and definitely enough to feed two. Prices still seem to be the same from what I remember years ago as well and great to see they don't hike up the prices for being in a tourist heavy spot along Michigan Avenue.

I'm sure by now you want details. Well, I am about to fill you in.  To begin. Me, My Aunt, and 3 nieces sat for about 10 minutes without being offered water or ANYTHING.

Yes, you heard that HE DID NOT LIFT A FINGER TO CLEAN UP THE ENTIRE MUG OF SPILLED LEMONADE. My aunt and niece cleans up this mess and he returns close to 5 minutes later with a new lemonade. He had the audacity to look irritated when I asked for a wet cloth so that we can clean the table and it not be sticky. After receiving the wet cloth HE WATCHED MY AUNT WIPE THE TABLE DOWN. I thought the situation was comical and said to him, ' I cant believe you're just going to watch her clean the table."" After my joking statement he still DID NOT HELP MY AUNT CLEAN THE TABLE.

Mash potato is awesome, Broccoli was just dipped in hot water (very crunchy with no seasoning at all). friend salad (BBQ chicken - replace chicken with shrimp) was very very good, however they charged 7# extra for ~ 8 pieces of shrimp and didn't put the chicken!! i thought that i a rip off since we asked for replacement (i know shrimp can be more expensive but they were small and only 8 pieces). but anyways we enjoyed the seating. Cheese cake was awesome like always (Godiva)  Waiter was out of this world and I mean he came a couple of times to confirm order, Napkins translated to more silverware.

However, the chicken tasted like a very basic home economics class recipe from a beginner. The mashed potatoes were very chunky and not creamy at all and a little salty. I also ordered chicken nachos that my bf liked but, I wasn't overly impressed with those either. The guacamole was bland, just tasted like mashed avocados. My bf ordered the fish and chips but, didn't like it because the batter was too airy and the fish was extremely soft and had no texture. For dessert he ordered the caramel cheesecake to go.

The cheesecake is 4 stars but again balances to 2 stars at such a ludicrous price. The service is quite good at 4 stars and overall look of the place was so bizarre that it is 2 stars.

He was running around like a maniac which made us feel hurried and on edge. NOT a relaxing meal. He did keep our glasses full.  We ordered our cheesecakes to go. Paid and left.  Within 20 minutes of leaving all four of my kids were sick with upset stomachs and diarrhea. Not a good experience when you have one bathroom in the hotel and they are fighting over who has to go worse. Something they used in the food destroyed their bowels. After an hour they were good again.  We brought back two slices of cheesecake. A cherry and a dulce de leche. Must say ""super disappointed"". Very little flavor, whipped cream was blah- had absolutely no sweetener in it and might as well been butter on top. Couldn't finish either slice.  For $77 with a tip on top of that- I will go eat elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=180

After walking in drenched from the soaking rain and the restaurant not being very busy we were ignored for a few minutes...and were finally seated. The next thing the bread that was brought out was totally hard and stale, and they did not bring any of that brown oat bread, just the white stuff (everyone else got a mixture)  Suffice to say after one bite we moved the bread to the side. The meal and Cheesecake were good, but when finished the meal we had to wait 15 minutes to order Cheesecake even though the restaurant was not busy.

Though it could have been a tad bit more spicy. The kiddie meals (cheese pizza n chicken tenders) were also nicer than most places. The kids had fudge sundaes which were great and the cheesecake slices (keylime n original) were melt-in-ur-mouth. Overall, a great meal n a wonderful experience for 2 adults n 2 kids in $65.

This location is a favorite of mine to stop in because it's very convenient. Cheesecake here is always 5 stars, although it is pretty expensive (easily 8-12 bucks a slice). Unfortunately, I find service to be really inconsistent and often slow. There have been multiple instances where I have waited 30 min to be seated, been assigned by the hostess to a table and then told that I will need to wait because there has been an error with the seating.

Kelly D.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,23,1,2.0,3/28/2015,"After visiting this location a few times I finally picked my birthday to express my sheer disappointment with this location.  In short, a friend and I just wanted cheesecake. We specified this to the host and she gave us a pager w/ my name and told us it would be 20 minutes.  30 minutes go by, and after lingering around the bar and stepping outside for a cigarette I decided to go check on the time at the host stand. Apparently my name and pager wasn't on the list. They had done a shift change so the hostess was not the one I was dealing with before. She explained to me that our name wasn't on the list anymore. I requested a manager. I knew it wasn't her fault.  So Julie, the manager, comes and speaks with me and I explain the situation. She checks the host stand with the hostess and the previous hostess had noted that ""we walked away"". What? Like, you think I want to take this pager to-go with me? No, I was walking around the bar and hanging by the front of the restaurant. I am aware and I made it clear that I knew it wasn't the current hostess's fault. I work in the industry so these things happen and it just sucks. Fortunately Julie was able to seat us immediately.  Unfortunately, the waitress we had must have caught wind of the situation and wasn't very pleasant. We were very nice to her so it was a shame she didn't greet us and introduce herself like she did to the other tables around us. My friend even told the hostess and manager that it was my birthday, but I didn't get a candle or any kind of ""happy birthday"" from anyone.  I've had issues with this place before in getting seated and not stellar service. But I guess that's what you get with corporate chain restaurants.

Giselle V.,"Irvine, CA",213,282,1596,1.0,3/23/2014,"This is a chain restaurant so the food tastes the same as it does at every other Cheesecake Factory. However, the service leaves A LOT to be desired.  When we sat down our waiter said that he would be back to take our drink order and when he came back he brought waters for all four of us with him. (The waters aren't significant now but they will be). After he took our drink order (two iced teas, one diet coke, one strawberry lemonade) and appetizer order, he came back with the two teas and said that he had completely forgotten the diet coke and needed to pick up the lemonade from the bar and that he had put in our order for the appetizer.  We didn't see him for another 10 minutes, that is, he didn't come to our table to check on us. He served the table across from us the lemonade we had ordered, that they had ordered after us and he stood at the computer most of the time shaking his head and punching buttons.  Our appetizer came out before the other half of our drink order came. When we were done with our appetizer he brought the other two drinks that had been ordered. We waited another 50 minutes for our food to come. During this time our waiter visited the aforementioned computer several times and continued to punch more buttons, shake his head in frustration and talk to himself.  The one time he did come to see how we were, he brought a water pitcher to refill the waters that we had to drink because our regular drink orders were empty, but he didn't refill any of the drinks we actually wanted. It took another 20 minutes after we finished our food, and had requested boxes, for us to receive said boxes and the check.  The only way this restaurant would be worth visiting is if someone came at a time that was not the busy dinner rush.  We sat next to the kitchen and saw how small it was and that the kitchen staff was trying their hardest to pump out orders while the wait staff stood around joking with each other, dropping plates and cups (6 dropped plates/cups occurred while we were seated, God knows how many there are every other day) and scavenging off of plates of food that had been returned.  As a patron I honestly do not appreciate seeing my waiter, and the rest of the wait staff, eat off of the same plate, using their bare hands and proceeding with their duties without washing their hands at any time during the whole process.  Also, the kitchen was rather small and I am not sure if it was responsible for serving both stories of the restaurant, which would not be wise on behalf of the restaurant chain itself, which could have accounted for it taking so long with our food to arrive.  Either way, if I am in the Chicago area again I will not return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=220

The service is ok but nothing special, I usually find that the waiters are doing a lot more running around than actually waiting on people and tend to slack on the extra stuff you might request, like more water, extra dressing or more bread. I've also found that if you're having a more ""basic"" dinner (meaning no appetizers or fancy drinks) that they tend to really leave you alone and often leave you with empty water glasses. On the flip side, if you both order a drink when you first meet the waiter, they're never going to stop hounding you.

Hai L.,"Chicago, IL",3,6,,1.0,11/25/2016,"I have always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I thought it was a great place that always aimed to please. Until I went to the Michigan ave location in Chicago. Now I get it, I was there on the Friday after thanksgiving. They did do some things right but they def need to make sure the do some training of the staff.   Something around the lines of even though it's really busy doesn't mean we take each customer for granted.  So I finished some shopping and stopped into the bar area. Yes they are busy. No I don't expect presidential treatment. Just the normal I would normally get from a place that has always treated me well. Well where things went right, like I said it was busy. So the wait was long. But someone came to me to explain the situation and I did think that was a very nice gesture. I told him that I understood it is very busy and the food was out a few minutes after. That was good. What went wrong.  The food was very late and no bread was EVER offered while waiting. In fact I forgot that was even an option until they served me some AFTER my meal at which point I said I'm good. No need to waste food.  The breakfast sandwich finally came out on what looked like hard toasted buttered white bread. I asked the bartender about this and she said that's the way it is. Not wanting to cause a fuss I said it seems like white bread but whatever. I ate the inside and left the bread in a pile on the side. The bartender just grabbed it without a second glass and took it away. I don't know but if I were a waiter and saw a half eaten meal that was just questioned i would ask if everything was okay with the meal. Not a peep. I guess i as the customer is supposed to raise hell and be the bad guy?  Anyways finished my drink and left. Will not eat at this particular location again.  I know it was busy but some things should just be obvious from a server point of view.  Maybe I gave a tourist vibe out that they will never come back again or something.  To end maybe after DNA testing it would be found that it was brioche. But I clearly was not happy with the meal.

Anthony M.,"Chicago, IL",3575,1312,9475,1.0,11/16/2012,"Tourist Trap located in the basement of the 4th tallest building in Chicago.  Sounds like fun doesn't it...NOT!!! I feel like I have grown up beyond the Cheesecake factory.  I am so tired of the menu.  It is so big that it takes about 20 minutes to look through it before you can finally decide what to order and then the waiter comes over, after 20 minutes to tell you the specials. Honestly!  Just print them up and insert them in the front of this massive book they call a menu.  I believe less is more and the menu here wants to make everyone happy and in the end it makes no one happy!  And the evidence is in the lossy food they push out of the kitchen. On my most recent visit I asked the hostess to have a booth because this was going to be a working lunch and we needed some room to layout our documents and make notes.  She took me to a table that had benches...I asked her if she considered it a booth and she said yes.  I then informed her that my colleague was not going to be happy but she insisted it was a booth.  So we sat down and literally our chest were at the table height.  There was no way we could even write or take notes. I hate to say I told you so but I am going to say, ""I TOLD YOU SO!"" So we got up and asked her again if we could have a booth.  It was already after 1pm and we had missed the lunch crowd, so there were plenty of booths in the back.  She then took us to a booth that had been half cleaned but not on my side.  I grabbed a clean napkin from another table and picked up the dirty tray and moved it to the next table. I then used the napkin to wipe up the mess.  It was awkward with me just standing in the aisle and I was not about to sit on top of a mess. The bus boy arrived and started to clean our whole table again.  He then grabbed his dirty gross full of wet food tray. Next he took silverware from the table that the dirty gross full of wet food tray was sitting on top of and placed it all in front of me.  Honestly I was so grossed out.  Someone call the health department!  How oblivious could this guy be?  This is just bad management and a corporation that does not care about keeping things clean for their customers.  I got up again and went to a different table to get myself some fresh silverware, a new plate and a clean napkin.   We ordered our food and made a few simple requests.  For example, I ordered my turkey sandwich to have mayo on the side.  Guess what?  I got mayo on the side and also got mayo on the sandwich.  Really?  Again the kitchen did not care enough to read the notes of the waiter.  I did not send it back because we were having a business meeting and I just needed to keep working and eating at the same time.  I also got my salad dressing on the side too and it never came to the table.  I had to remind the food runner about it and eventually the waiter brought it. My buddy got the fish tacos and when I asked him how they were he made a face that told me they were not really good.  I am so glad we did not share them because I would have been mad.  He then said, ""I do not even like this place it is just so close to the office!""  Not to self...find a new restaurant to have our lunch meetings in! So yes this place is a tourist trap.  It is one of those chains that all of the hungry shoppers on Michigan Avenue from out of town end up in because it is familiar to them.  Now do not get me wrong there cheesecake is good and maybe cheesecake on this visit would have made me feel better or even 4 star-ish but cheesecake and business lunches do not go together. The food here is not that great.  In all of the years I have still not found anything on this menu that just jumps out and says, ""Order me all of the time!""  In fact, I just give up!  This place is a cheesecake place that happens to serve bad food too.  And when I say bad food...I mean food that is not even special or good.  I was also not happy with the service.  A hostess who could not actually give us a booth even though there were a bunch available.  A busboy who really did not care if his dirty disgusting tray was touching clean silverware and plates.  Someone could get sick because of this.  Food that had special requests made but none of the special requests were even carried out correctly.   This place just keeps packing people in and does not care to make it the best experience ever!  And that is sad with all of the amazing restaurants in downtown Chicago.  I wish you would clean up your act cheesecake factory and have a little respect for the product you are serving the public.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=200

Okay, I'm back-- so what else about this joint?  Highlight comes via the hostess station: these girls is a bunch of sour pusses, for real.  The only time they smile is when they swing through a server station to flirt with a guy or talk trash about the one coworker also seating (possibly manager) who is obviously not like the others. I'll just leave it at that. They clearly lack knowledge about the concept of situational awareness, too. I've seen them give the gasface to at least a dozen families/groups because, I imagine, they're ""not sitting down fast enoughjustsitdown,God!"" If you work here a few times a week, and stand at a crappy little podium with a map of the joint, you'll likely be more comfy there. Customers, on the other hand, particularly ones that don't frequent the place, want to gauge the light, or whether or not they're sitting under the full blast AC, or are identifying exits, or who knows what but why is your sour little gas face in such a hurry to get back to the podium?  You ain't smilin' or greetin'. You just gasfacin'. And you get paid by the hour, not by the guest (or gasface). Look, the food's good, right?  But I can't imagine ever coming back to this atmosphere. Above comments are completely exclusive of my server, Lauren, who was rad. Although she kept calling me 'sir' when I'm obviously not that kind of customer, made it known, and she must've known anyhow because it was weird EVERY single time. I think this place breeds that sort of weirdness, though, and I encourage her to at the very least be aware it, best case scenario get outta there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=200

We waited an hour, granted it was a Saturday night, so I don't mind waiting, but we were put at a tiny table where I could easily have bumped elbows with the parties on either side. This should have been a red flag, but we were hungry so we gave it a shot. We saw how busy it was so after waiting to be helped (for the first time) for another 10 minutes, we ordered our drinks, and an appetizer. Our waiter returned with our drinks 5 minutes later, but forgot to get my wife her water. I asked him kindly to bring the water as soon as he could, and we also ordered our food. The water never came, and neither did the appetizer, our food was out 20 minutes later. It was primarily cold. We left never having received the appetizer or water, but you better believe they left the appetizer on the bill. Don't worry, I had it removed before paying. Maybe we had a bad experience because went at the wrong time, but there are too many good restaurants in Chicago to waste money and time at a place like this. Truly disappointing.

Colin M.,"Crown Point, IN",2,40,6,3.0,12/17/2014,"Came here with a group of co-workers on Saturday night. My first ever Cheesecake Factory Experience, and only because someone else picked it. Honestly, after reading the ""Eat This Not Thant"" horror stories, I wanted to run screaming from this place. They have arguably the ""Worst Dish In America"" with their Bistro Shrimp pasta, clocking in at over 2200 calories per serving. That's more than a days worth of calories in one gloppy plate of pasta! Que horreur! But, it was either beg off dinner or join the group. So I joined the group. Kudo's on the Skinnylicious Menu. They have a number of selections advertised as less than 590 calories, so I guess that is acceptable. Mostly these selections are salads or fish (or a combination of both).  I had the chopped salad, which contained chicken, apple, corn and avocado and it was pretty good. I didn't trust the calorie count so I didn't finish it. My seatmate to the right had the grilled ahi tuna salad, which he was very pleased with. He literally ate every last morsel of salad on the plate. I personally don't like raw tuna, but he really found the meal excellent. His wife ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and again, she said she really enjoyed it. I was told that she never likes anything she gets at a restaurant, so this was really a victory for The Cheesecake Factory.  One of my table mates had the appetizer chicken Caesar salad, and it was enormous. We all said, ""This is the appetizer size???"" Honestly, it was entree sized. But good, reportedly.  There were other, acceptable dishes on the table, none so good that they warrant inclusion in this review. The only other thing to note was the size of the desserts. Again, one slice of cheesecake was as big as the entree. Ginormous. And the very slender woman who ordered it dispatched it down her alimentary canal with alacrity. I don't know how a very slender woman can eat 3000 calories worth of food and stay slender. So all in all, I would have to say that the Cheesecake Factory wasn't bad. Service was decent. I don';t think I would drive downtown for a chain restaurant, but if in a similar situation, I would have a lot less trepidation about the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=240

The food is pretty consistently fresh and of good quality, and there is enough variety for everyone to find something that they like. When I've gone alone, with a date, or friends, it has been 90% satisfactory, as well. (I miss you, Avery!) With all of that being said, I went again tonight. I told myself that it was for the Pre-National Cheesecake Day deal (1/2 off dessert slices), but I digress. I am taking the time to be the bazillionth reviewer of The Cheesecake Factory because of water! Yes, you read me correctly. Water is the the reason for this review. I just couldn't take it anymore! The food, the ambience, and the service are all laudable, but the water SUCKS DIRT! I don't understand how a fine dining establishment such as TCF can serve its guests such AWFUL water! I had to squeeze almost an entire lime into my glass in order to make it palatable! About 3 visits prior, I went with a very outspoken friend, who, upon being asked by our server if he needed anything else, said,""Yes. Get rid of this nasty a** water, and bring me some GOOD water! I was a mortified, but the server returned shortly with a glass of perfectly delicious, and, apparently, purified water! He mentioned that he'd gotten it from another part of the restaurant. Hunh?!? You KNOW what I asked for on my next visit, right? Unfortunately, this server must not have known about the secret source, because he brought me a bottle of Fiji and a glass, and tacked on a hefty $5 for the pleasure. It's needless to say that I didn't try that one again, as I don't particularly care to pay so dearly for a glass of water worth drinking. My dearest Cheesecake Factory, can you PLEASE remedy this one major flaw?

I usually do not have complaints with the cheesecake factory but this occasion was the exception. We ordered to corn tamales as usually because they are so good it has to be a sin. I regret not ordering the red velvet cheesecake because I I did nto like my past at all. The sauce was water and thin and did not coat the past so I felt like I was eating dry season pasta. I would never order that meal again. We asked for extra sauce but that dish is just not a winner. We sat in these booths in the back and my friends seat was wobbly if that makes any sense.

This is not a place we would usually get lunch or dinner at. What a horrible mistake! The worst burger experience of my life. Also the decor is hideous!  We came in around 1:45pm and had to wait almost 45 minutes to be seated.  After being seated we placed our order.  We had a lot of time to look over the menu when we were waiting 10 years for a table. We both ordered the Factory burger - I requested my burger well done with double tomato and no onions.  My boyfriend requested his burger medium rare and with only cheese. About 30 minutes later our server comes back with our food and plops it down and runs off.   Just by looking at my burger I could tell it was the wrong order.  Instead of the Factory burger I received the Smokehouse BBQ Burger (WTF I HATE BBQ SAUCE! HATE IT! The smell makes me sick)  My boyfriend's burger was fine and started to eat.   I tried to flag down a waiter or a staff member and there were none to be seen.  Finally 15 minutes later I was able to grab a bus boy and get him to grab our server.  After waiting another 10 minutes our server finally shows back up and I explain to him that I have the wrong burger and he admits he wrote the wrong thing down on our ticket. Wtf?  How do you mix up a factory burger and a BBQ burger?  He offered to bring me another burger and I refused because I wasn't going to wait another 30 minutes to get a burger when my boyfriend had been done eating for 20 minutes!   The server barely apologized.  I asked for the burger to be taken off our bill as I couldn't eat it.  He said he couldn't do that but could give me a piece of cheesecake for free.  Ummm wtf?  Are you serious?  You messed up my order, delivered a burger I couldn't eat but you are still going to charge me full price for it?  Hello! I'm starving!!!!!!!! The server brought us a tiny piece of cheesecake after we paid.   Thank god we didn't have to pay anything out of pocket for the crap the Cheesecake Factory serves. Service was horrible and non existent.  I didn't get to eat anything for lunch.

Followed by three meals that were incorrect / under cooked. The waiter dropped bread on our table and expected us to still eat it . I ordered the kale salad and the Diane steak which was delicious ( Thank God ). But I just feel like the service could have been much better than it was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=280

That being said, I think I've been offered free cheesecake every time for that very reason. I will say the menu here is pretty extensive, great HUGE salads (I'm talking like, a whole head of lettuce in one serving) as well as steaks, tons of appetizers, single plates, sandwiches, pastas, pizza, and of course their many kinds of cheesecakes.

Case in point, I went to Cheesecake Factory today(4/3/17) around 2 pm during lunch it was not as busy as usual and I placed an order to go at the dessert section. The Indian lady who took my order said it would take about 10-15 minutes to get my food. I waited and after about 30 minutes, during which there was almost no one waiting at the counter I asked the girl at the front desk about the food. I explained to her that I had been waiting for a while and her reply was that she had nothing to do with it and that I should ask the lady from the bakery who wasn't there at the time. I have been here many times and I  knew that it was unusual to wait this long especially when it wasn't as busy. After a few minutes the Indian (lady came back and I asked her about my food (which was already sitting on the shelf) She then packed it for me without any explanation or apology. When  I asked her what took so long as the restaurant wasn't  busy, she rolled her eyes at me and said the kitchen was busy. I told her there was no need to be rude and that an apology would have been nice for keeping me waiting.

Of course I love the desserts!  This Cheesecake is fun to eat at because it is located below street level in the Hancock building. It can be very crowded and is a smaller location. Unfortunately, one of their wait staff spilled food all over by suit and shoes when I was there on business and when I attempted to send the manager the cleaning bill, they never responded.  Besides this, the reason this establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated.

Customers are standing and waiting to be seated in line. They get pagers to know when their table is finally ready. And it can take 15 or even 30 minutes. To my mind the place is not the most delicious or prestigious or anything to spend so much time waiting. Time waiting for to go food is enormous too. And I heard the clients were not very happy with the service. Of course if it's called the ""Cheesecake Factory"" - their cheesecakes are good. But as for the food on the menu, it's absolutely ordinary and there is nothing to droll that much about, it's a chain restaurant and besides in some other their locations the service is much better. And the prices are a bit above the average there to me for the quality of food they offer. There are tons of different and more interesting and delicious places around there to visit.

Personally I'd rather if they just told me, seems simpler. When I was ready to leave I had to wait about ten minutes before my server stopped again so I could settle up. To his credit he got the tab out and ran my card lickity split, but I was surprised dessert was not mentioned.

As a usual consumer, I am interested in well-cooked dishes, high quality of food, unusual atmosphere and relatively acceptable prices. I would recommend you the Cheesecake factory, as it includes all of those options. To begin with, I want to highlight a wide range of dishes and their unusual big portions.  The Cheesecake Factory has his own extraordinary atmosphere. It creates a special mood among guests. I was really impressed by a unique décor, which makes you feel like you are in a fairytale: the nicely subdued light, pleasant music playing on the background, white-dressed waiters.  It is very clear from these observations that the Cheesecake Factory has all options to serve guests best and exceed their expectations. If you are interested in high service, appetizing food, unusual and out-of-the way atmosphere, so the Cheesecake Factory is a great alternative for you. When I came to the Cheesecake Factory, I liked immediately the service of this place. The stuff find to you a table and they present a menu. Before to take the order, they bring to you a glass of water and than I ordered pasta. A big plate of pasta Fettuccine Alfredo, that could be divided among 3 persons, surprised me. It is a common fact that the bigger the size of portions the bigger the price. The Cheesecake Factory is an exception to this rule. In addition, the dishes are not just large they are extremely tasty. It is an indisputable advantage that makes consumers happy.  The Cheesecake Factory has the most various and delicious range of cheesecake flavors such as: Oreo, Pumpkin, Red Velvet Cake and so on. I ordered the Strawberry cheesecake, which was so delicious and looked really beautiful. Deserts make people happy and the Cheesecake Factory knows how to do it best. The Cheesecake Factory is considered as the most popular place to have good time with family and friends, celebrate birthdays, family events.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=300

It was a last minute decision on a busy Saturday night to come here for a drink and appetizer. We had 5 people and the host was just about to write our name down for a 1.5 hour wait when the most wonderful little waitress came over and said ""hi I have immediate seating for 5 in the cafe"". We'll take it! She was fantastic! Then our waitress for the evening was also just wonderful. She gave us recommendations, never rushed us, and when a bigger table opened up after 10 minutes she moved us quickly over to it. What service! The cafe part has a more limited menu than the restaurant. We had the lettuce wraps and I had the sangria. Yum yum! Everything was delicious.

There are Cheesecake Factories all over the country, and if you're going to be downtown Chicago, why not eat a  restaurant unique to the area?  The last time I went here was with some family from out of town, and they really wanted to eat here for some reason .... Anyways, went here around lunch time and the tables smelled really weird, the smell of old dishrag water. It was pretty gross. The prices of the food are pretty pricy for the quality. Maybe I'm just biased, but the Cheesecake Factory is nothing special.  But if anything, I do enjoy their cheesecakes.

We were seated in a booth, and I instantly noticed that our lamp was amazingly dusty. Like, I was scared if someone ran past our table, dust would fall into our food. I ordered a red sangria, because I love sangria and I want to try it everywhere. Their sangria was OVERLY sweet. I know it's the cheesecake factory, but there's no reason my sangria should taste like a cherry jolly rancher. My friend got the chicken caesar salad.

Just a tip: the Cheesecake cafe upstairs serves the same food but from a limited menu. Since the main restaurants menu is a little ridiculous anyway, this ""top 75"" menu is perfect. Service is great and portions are HUGE. I ordered the chicken Madeira which is so so so good. Chicken breasts topped with asparagus, mozzerella, and some mushroom sauce. It comes with mashed potatoes and it is so yum. My boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and it was ok. Good flavors, very spicy.

I got the spinach artichoke dip to start and wasn't the best I've ever had, but was very delicious. I then got the americana cheeseburger which was very meaty and hit the spot for my craving.

Celebrating my 50th birthday and wondering where to celebrate, I was lucky I spotted this location, which also happened to be close to the hotel we were staying at.  The first thing that really struck me was that we were able to get a table right away and this being a Friday night!  The waitress seemed to either be new or totally overwhelmed because she kept forgetting things and had to keep calling her back over and over. Food was typical Chessecake Factory fare, so no real surprises here.  While having dinner, an employee carrying a container with ice dropped it close to our table making a whole mess... When it came time for dessert, my wife asked for a slice of cheesecake and she expected to have it with a birthday candle like the so many other times in other locations but to her surprise, they were out of candles.

We were stuffed!  Everything was really delicious, the gravy on my mashed potatoes had mushrooms in it so I think it was the madeira mushroom sauce that normally comes with the Steak Diane (which I would have ordered - maybe next time).  My only beef (pun intended) is that there was gristle on my tenderloin, which I just can't forgive for a 29.95 price tag.  And what was supposed to be medium rare was medium, boo.  But it's a chain, and I refused to bitch about anything.  I was just happy to be eating because I saved up all day and was very hungry.  So that's where that point went.

Caitlyn P.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2016,"We've gotten takeout from this specific location a couple times before, with no issues. However, over the weekend, our experience with this Cheesecake Factory was almost unbearable. My boyfriend and I both ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with chipotle mayo... Everything looked ok, nothing special about the presentation, but the moment we both bit into the sandwich, it was like biting into a piece of chicken coated in soggy breading. And had no flavor whatsoever. Literally tasted like fried, soggy buttery bread. Horrible. Not even the ""spicy"" mayo did anything to help it. Literally took one bite and threw it in the garbage. My son ordered the macaroni and cheese burger. When I looked at the presentation, it had to be one of the most unappealing things I've seen in a long time. The fried macaroni should be a nice golden color sitting on top of the burger, but instead it looked like a rubbery gray-brown ball. My son could barely stomach one bite. My other son had the kid chicken tenders; they were just as bad as our chicken sandwiches. The only redeeming factor about the meal was our appetizer of the fried avocado egg rolls. But even those were mediocre. My experience picking up the food was also unpleasant. Already waited in a line for close to 10 minutes and when I got to the register and told her my name and that I was here to pickup my order, she looked around almost confused, then found a receipt and told me ""she couldn't ring me up because she didn't take the order."" She proceeded to call the other waiter to come to the register which took about another 6-7 minutes. Both girls at the register were rude, and unapologetic.

I have been with groups of 10+ people, all sharing dishes, and have yet to try something I didn't enjoy. The portions are large enough that you'll be stuffed, yet will still have plenty of leftovers.

Lindsey A.,"Chicago, IL",71,329,24,2.0,7/24/2011,"I've lived in Chicago for six years and have never once had the desire to endure all that is the Cheesecake Factory. But, my partner having received a gift cert for the chain, and us already being downtown on Saturday evening, we ventured in with patience.  It's not that the Factory has bad food or bad drinks or bad service or bad anything, really (it's actually all mediocre). It's just that it is exactly what its title says - a factory. You wait 45 minutes with 1,000 tourists to grab a seat in a restaurant that easily serves hundreds. Your waiter or waitress will immediately saunter up and say they're really busy (because, well, they are) while you pour over a 10-plus-page menu of everything from tacos to pastas to pizzas to sandwiches.  When you finally decide on an over-priced dish, your waiter will ask if you need anything. You'll suggest water and it'll take 10 minutes to come. Servers, hostesses, bussers and other members of this food manufacturing facility will sashay by - busy as bees. Your food will arrive semi-quickly, a portion so huge it might as well be stamped with ""America!"" on it. If the factory cut their portion sizes in half, they could also cut their prices in half, which for the actual food itself, would make sense, because it's nothing we haven't had before.  My chicken and biscuits were indeed chicken and biscuity, just as they should be, but my partner's salmon packed much more flavor (I wanted comfort food, though, and it did meet that expectation). Service? Meh. Our guy was nice enough - when he was around. We ended up with a hybrid approach to being waited on - a woman who filled in when our guy kept forgetting things (water, an explanation of the menu, etc.)  The factory is exactly as I expected it to be, nothing more and nothing less. They should consider slowing down a little - I suspect that 45-minute wait is standard busy or not - and cutting portions (nearly every table I spied had take-away bags) and besides, shouldn't we all just be here for the cheesecake, anyway?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=340

Ndidi B.,"Chicago, IL",1,19,5,4.0,12/27/2013,"Last night was my first time ever dining at The Cheesecake Factory. I had read a few Yelp reviews prior to and the mixed feedback had me skeptical. But my boyfriend had received a CF giftcard from his job, so we decided to have a date night here. I knew the restaurant would be packed because several Yelpers coined this place as a ""tourist trap"", so I decided to call ahead to get an estimate of the wait time. The lady said it was a half hour wait and kindly informed me that I could not put my name on the list over the phone when I tried to. My boyfriend ended up arriving before me, so our table was ready by the time I got there. I asked him how long he had been there and he said it had only been a 15 minute wait.  We were escorted to our table and given menus. I have seen some pretty large 'multi-paged' menus in my lifetime, but never had I seen a menu with ads! I chuckled to myself as it became clear why this place was labeled a tourist trap. As we were perusing, a female server named Liz came over and introduced herself. She asked if she could start us off with drinks and I asked her for two ice waters and two cups of hot water. [The hot water was for the silverware, which several Yelpers had pointed out would be filthy and to my suprise, were correct.] A few minutes after she left, a male server named Ryan came over and introduced himself. He then proceeded to ask if he could get us any drinks. Suprised, I told him we had been greeted already. He then explained that the previous server had been confused about whether or not we were her table, and apologized for the confusion. After recieving our drinks, being served warm bread and Ryan patiently answering all of my boyfriend's redundant questions about salads, we ordered our entrees. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio while my boyfriend ended up going with the Ceasar. Our food arrived in a timely manner, long enough for me to discover that each bathroom stall has its own personal sink and us to eat all of our bread, and looked absolutely delicious. Once we began to dig in, we both were pleasantly suprised. His Ceasar was generously portioned and well-dressed, while my pasta had my tastebuds rejoicing. I begged him to taste my dish and he, being born in Italy and a Italian food connoisseur, was also impressed. The overall evening was better than I expected, and my complaints were few and far apart. Sadly, it was my night to pick up the bill and last night's budget did not allow for me to try an cheesecake. Lol. In conclusion, I realize that The Cheesecake Factory is not a five-star restaurant, as should anyone else considering eating here. The food was tasty and that is all that matters. P.S. I took off a star because of the silverware. I'm a slight germaphobe, and icky silverware makes me feel uncomfortable. The managers of this restaurant really need to pay more attention to this issue, because I'm sure that is some sort of health code violation! :c",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=340

I love Cheesecake Factory, of any place I've ever been in Chicago, their lettuce wraps are hands down my favorite. After letting out my inner child at Navy Pier all day, I wanted lettuce wraps and I was up for the long jaunt down Michigan Ave on a Sunday. Upon getting there, as always it was packed, but only a 20 minute wait. This location under the Hancock building is pretty large and they get people in and out in a timely manner. I am a fan of their wheat bread, I can't get enough of that stuff! The staff is super friendly and chipper, which I think is even more impressive when you work somewhere that is always so populated. The staff is really always up on their A-Game. My Thai lettuce wraps were amazing, and huge! It's been probably 8 or 9 months since I've had them and they were delicious! I strongly recommend these!

Nick started with us, very informative, great smile, pleasant attitude, and was very composed in the middle of a huge dinner rush. He definitely possesses a very valuable professional work ethic where I can see him in management. He also informed us later that Tinos would take over, where as before he had his hands full. That shows great communication amongst the co workers and I applaud that! Tinos also was wonderful, very warm welcoming attitude, great smile. Even the bussers wished us to enjoy our meals which was refreshing.  The food was fantastic, two thumbs up. I had the Sun-dried tomato pasta with a red and white sauce mix (with chicken). Perfect combination of sweet and savory. My husband had the jambalaya pasta which he loved. He said ""This is the first time I am eating from someone else's opinion and it was very good! He was on point with this!"" I don't have to say much about the cheesecake, we all know it's good! Only thing negative is I do not recommend sitting by the window, there was a strong cold draft I had to wear my winter coat and scarf the entire time with my husbands jacket on my legs.

Adela V.,"Miami, FL",42,5,,1.0,7/22/2014,"HORRIBLE.  I've been to various locations across the country and always loved the food, service, and overall atmosphere. I always go to a CF for my birthday since cheesecake is THE best dessert and their selection is amazing. Yesterday was my birthday and I was craving some orange chicken (which is what I always tend to order) and birthday cheesecake. So, my husband and I headed over for some birthday fun (or so I thought).  The location is great which is also why I wanted to go, the view and the breeze while sitting outside are amazing! It was a Monday night and was surprisingly busy (tourists maybe?), so we waited about 30 minutes for a table outside, which was fine, I don't mind waiting so long as the experience is a good one. Once we sat down, a waiter did not come by to take our order for about 15min. We already knew what we wanted to order since we had decided during our 30min wait. When the waiter came by, FINALLY, we ordered our food (spinach and cheese dip as an appetizer, orange chicken for me and pasta carbonara for my husband). Our waiter asked if we wanted some bread, we of course said YES! The bread took about another 15min to arrive, and by then our appetizer arrived too. Ok, so far so good. Then, about 20min later, our food arrived. We were about ready to eat a whale at that point, we were super hungry! That's when the disappointment comes. The food was bland. The white rice that came with my orange chicken was cold, the orange chicken itself was also cold and hard, not nice and chewy and flavorful like I remember. My husband's pasta was watery and was cold as well, no salt, no flavor. We tried to make the best of it and tried to eat it as is, but stopped about 1/4 of the way through and just could not take another bite. We were waiting for the server to come by to tell him, but he didn't come by for another 30min. By then, we just wanted to go home. I told him that the food was horrible and we just wanted the check. He said that we should've told him earlier so that he could've told his manager and the cooks and given us other options. (Um, maybe if you didn't take 30min to check on us?) But, apparently we had eaten some of it and we no longer would be credible. WHAT? We ate 1/4 of the plate because we attempted to deal with it. If it were good, trust me, the plates would have been CLEAN, no food left on them. My husband and I are huge foodies.  I heard the waiter talk to his manager behind us, trying to get us a discount I guess (nice of him), but his manager just shrugged his shoulders and we were given our $70 bill for the appetizer we ate and 1/4 portion we could stomach down. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK TO CF. I don't know if it's just this location because it's downtown, but it really put a dent in my loyalty to CF. Utterly disappointed.  Worst part, it ruined my birthday. Thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=400

I don't have anything particularly negative to say about the Cheesecake Factory, but there was a bit of a sticker shock when we got our bill.  Were those martinis really worth $10 a pop?  Um, no. For  two entrees, two drinks, two slices of cheesecake and a tip, I walked out $80 lighter.  That seems disproportionate.  If the prices were more reasonable, I could notch this baby to 4 stars, easy.

Man, pasta with pesto sauce, chicken and cream sauce on top. If you think that's not enough, they PILE a a beautiful bed of Arugula on top. It's such a nice compliment.  Cheesecake factory has quite the extensive menu. There are pages and pages and pages of menu items. For all taste buds. I find it really hard to believe if you say you can't find something on the menu you like. But, I wouldn't necessarily blame you if you just got tired of searching. But, PLEASE, keep trying. It's stellar!  Of course, you can't go here without having it's namesake! Personally, I recommend the Banana Cream Cheesecake without the extra whipped cream (I gotta be good somewhere). It's awesomeness!  So... 1) Food is banging. The portions are HUGE! Definitely enough food to share and take some home!  2) Service is always awesome. I always get the best servers, and I'm one to chat it up with them, so I do so.  3) THE BROWN BREAD! EAT THE BROWN BREAD. I always tell them, ""don't bring any of that sourdough stuff"".

This was my first time coming to any Cheesecake Factory in the US. My wife and I wanted to have a great experience all around but that dream came to a halt.    It came to a halt in several ways. The first was when the manager mispronounced my name when calling our reservation.    The next was when the manager sat us next to an area where cold air was being brought in through the back doors. I told the manager we couldn't sit there but while he was listening to me, he had his hand on my shoulder. It was kind of like a in the animal kingdom asserting-my-dominance power play. It was really passive-aggressive and so I did the only logical thing and proceeded to put my hand on his shoulder. He told us that he would get us another table but that we had to go back and wait for him. Bad move on his part.    As if, the manager wasn't enough we were greeted by our waiter. I abruptly told him that my wife and I needed to move and we were waiting for the manager to come pick us up.   Now, I'm a kind man. When I do a job in the service industry, I come from a place of peace. This waiter told us to leave because he had to make tips. It was in the most condescending way possible.  He made us feel like dollar signs.  Even if we were dollar signs to him at least give us the illusion that we are not and actually provide good service.    He then later apologized but it was too little, too late.    Good food yet such lousy service. I really hope the district manager trains the individuals mentioned in the review.  No mercy for those who don't know that good service is key to a businesses' success.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=400

Not so good: - Strawberry Lemonade; you're pretty much just drinking a glass of sugar. Just a hint of lemonade for me. - The wait, part 1; they told us an hour, gave us a buzzer that went off in an hour, we turned it in and were told to wait in a line for our name to be called, which was an additional 30 minutes.... - The wait, part 2; .....because they lost track of people's names, including ours. - The wait, part 3; A manager put in an appetizer to appease us....but didn't tell our waiter. The appetizer was delivered to the wrong table while the waiter was heading to the kitchen to check on it. Since we were already waiting, we added a second appetizer to the mix. A waiter-helper brought the original appetizer (!!!) plus an appetizer...that...we...didn't...order. True story. - The bill; We were told by our waiter the the manager wouldn't take anything off. We told him we need to talk to him/her. We explained our experience to the manager that came, and the bill was cut in half. Then the waiter said that THIS manager was the one he was hoping to get initially, not the one that first denied our claim. So there's a rogue manager roaming the premises and pleasing the customers...ok. - For the love of God, I would love to actually see the person sitting next to me. Mood lighting is one thing, nap lighting is another. Irritatingly dark in parts of the restaurant. Final thought: The food is, and has always been, excellent for us.

Annie H.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,,1.0,7/3/2015,"Wow.  This place is terrible on so many levels.  I've been to other Cheesecake Factories and have always had a positive experiences but this place is just so poorly run... if they were in any other location than Michigan Ave. they would surely be out of business.  I checked in with the hostess and was told it would be 15 minutes for outside seating.  So we waited for 15... 20... 30 minutes.  Finally I went up to the hostess stand and asked (nicely) how much longer it would be.  The hostess said ""Oh you're next on the list.  Should be 10 minutes.""  So we waited for 10... 15... 20 minutes.  So I went up to the hostess stand and said ""Look, we were told 15 minutes and it's been 45 minutes.""  And the hostess said, ""Yeah I know.""  And walked away.  Here's a little tip for you sweetheart... if you're going to be a little C U Next Tuesday then you should probably work in a different industry than the HOSPITALITY industry.   Anyway.  We finally get seated and I ask to speak to a manager.  He comes over 10 minutes later and says, ""I'm sorry that happened!  I'll get you started off right!""  Meanwhile, our waiter is nowhere to be found, we have no waters, and no bread.  Waiter finally shows up with a plate of some weird, fried greasy avocado egg rolls (which we didn't ask for and didn't want).  Not exactly a great way to get us ""started off right.""  Food finally comes (we never got bread and had to ask 3 times for water) and it was also greasy and gross.  We ended up being comped for the nasty avocado rolls, which we never asked for and didn't want.  So gross food, bad service, incredibly rude host staff, and clueless manager.  Stay away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=380

Since we wanted to try a little bit of everything we ordered 4 apps and she literally scoffed at us and said, ""woah!""...as if to food shame us for ordering 2 too many apps for just us two ppl! SO MAD! she never once asked if we needed anything in the meantime, she then took the order of the table next to us and the faces/looks she was giving this mother/daughter was horrible! she took her time in talking and getting food for the other tables in her section but not us. our food came in 2 cycles which was fine however, she never once came to check on us and then when she noticed we weren't eating anymore, she just took our dishes away and we had to flag her down to give us the bill.

My husband and I had breakfast/brunch a few days ago at the Cheesecake Factory. The place wasn't too crowded, which was a plus. We got a seat right away and our server was at our table within minutes. We were really craving eggs, so we were thrilled to see that these guys serve breakfast ALL day. First, we requested some well needed coffee. It was delicious! My husband ordered a cheese and sausage omelette. I ordered something called the ""energy breakfast,"" egg whites with spinach, tomatoes and toast. Both meals were decent.  We took some slices of cheesecake to go (I took the low carb cheesecake while my husband ordered the peanut butter cake cheesecake). They were very tasty (even the low carb one)!  My conclusion is that this place isn't known for its food, rather, its all about the cheesecake here. Don't be disappointed if the food isn't phenomenal.

For crying out loud... It's the freaking Cheesecake Factory in the Hancock building.  Were you expecting anything else? There are, however, a few tips to getting in, getting sat, getting a good meal and getting on with your life. First, NEVER come here on a weekend.  Just don't do it.  I know you don't want to sit next to a sweaty dude from Kenosha wearing jorts and a fanny pack any more than I do.  And if you come to CF on a weeknight, you just may avoid the influx of crazy tourists.  I mean, you'll still probably see some Kentucky-fried bangs and Reeboks, but probably less on a Wednesday evening than a Saturday, right?  You'll also avoid a fairly hefty wait.  Seating tends to come more quickly on the weeknights. Second, order the raspberry martini.  Just do it and don't worry about the stigma of drinking a pink drink.  My dad is the manliest man ever and he tucked into that pink cocktail like it was his job.  They're good.  Lethally good. Third, eat the Navajo sandwich.  Calorie-bomb?  YES.  Flavor-bomb?  YESSSSSS.  Grilled chicken, shredded lettuce, lush tomatoes, red onion and a bit of mayo on fry bread is just heaven.  You can do a double spin class tomorrow, ok? Finally, just get a piece of cheesecake.  If you ask your server nicely, they'll even cut it in half for you and serve it on separate plates.  That means double whipped cream, ya'll!  I'm partial to the fresh strawberry. Sometimes you have to eat downtown.  Cheesecake Factory can certainly be a more than acceptable place to make it happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=380

It's at the end of Michigan Ave. right under the Hancock Tower (which is cool!) So, if you are done with your shopping excursion, you can come straight here. The layout and decorations of this TCF were interesting and well put together. It seemed clean, if memory serves correctly, and comfortable.  The waiters/waitresses were nice and attentive. And that's saying a lot seeing as how crazy busy this place got! Now, onto the food. Which can make or completely break a restaurant... and I'm happy to report that it made this place.

Oh and get over yourself too. If you were that much of a foodie you would have never stepped foot in this place to begin with. Okay! So now that we've got that out of the way on to the review... :-) So, I've been to Cheesecake plenty of times. Overall, it's not a bad spot. I think the ambiance is cute...in a weird but whimsical sort of way (Yes I said whimsical).  The menu is overwhelming and it's hit or miss. Once you find something you like you should probably just stick with it every time. Keeps the disappointment down you know? Last time I was in this place I had the most excellent server. She was amazing. Every recommendation she made was spot on. Oh and they have a new pineapple upside down cheesecake that is TO DIE FOR. I rarely eat their cheesecake but this one is definitely worth a trip back. Overall, this place isn't bad. It's super crowded and touristy so I'd say stick to going during off peak hours.

I'm a fan of all the cheesecakes that incorporate some type of chocolate cake.  - The restaurant is huge so the wait is not as long as it may seem when you walk into the place. On a busy Saturday my friend and I only had to wait between 20 to 30 minutes.  - The employees, from the waiters to the busboys, here always seem to maintain a positive attitude even when they are obviously swamped with the amount of tables they have to juggle - Depending on what you order you can get a large meal that is probably at minimum two servings for a reasonable price.  Cons:  - This location it's always packed with tourist so you're always guaranteed to wait no matter the time of date.  - If it wasn't for the Cheesecake I don't think anyone over 18 would eat here. The food quality is sub par at best so they give you a serving size that could feed a family of 4.  - Due to this location always being so busy you always have a 50/50 chance of your food being cold.

Cynthia was our waitress, she was a nice enough lady but a terrible waitress. It took close to 10 minutes to come over and greet us. She took our drink orders and got those over to us but forgot the water, the first of 4 times asking for water. Then we ordered our appetizer and dinners. The app came and we still didn't have silverware or plates until she came and checked on us and we had to ask. The guac was great, but we had to wait another 35-40 minutes for our meals. For our second round of drinks she brought me a margarita instead of Sangria and said ""they are both Mexican drinks""....(FALSE). When my meal actually came out she forgot my creamed corn.. I believe the main issue was that she decided to not use a note pad so she had to come back and confirm what we actually wanted. The most aggravating part of the whole experience was that every time she made a mistake she would make up some long excuse to try and make us feel sorry for her. She even mentioned that her son was at another table and that they were caught up talking. The dinner was hard to enjoy because we were getting increasingly more upset with our service as the night continued...  A manager stopped by our table to check on us: Manager: ""How is everything this evening for you?"" Me: ""......um just alright"" Manager: ""Alright, well I just wanted to check to make sure everything was going well. You're  welcome."" **briskly walks away** SOOO AWKWARD!!!

My experiences at the cheesecake factories has not been good overall, but I was hoping since they specializes in cheesecake, this would be different. It was not! First of all, customer service here is not very good and it may be due to all the tourism. For example, the register guy was on the phone for some time taking an order while we waited to make an order in person. Shouldn't someone else do that? Shouldn't you take care of the customer in front of you first. We were not the only one's with this complaint. They did serve us some huge portions as you can see from the picture.

Don't know why they asked how I wanted to cook because they overcooked it anyways. Burger was kind of plan after the Mac and cheese was gone.

The waiter will visit your table a couple times an hour, when they get around to it. Our entrées this time took around 45 minutes. The manager came by but offered no explanation or recompense.  The cherry on top was when, on finally seeing our waiter again after dinner, we asked to see the dessert menu.

I get my carryout in half the time, and it's stuff like pork chops or burgers or something they really have to cook. Also to watch people who were seated much after you receive their meals before you. I mean seated after the waiter has already taken and supposedly put in your order. The redemption for this visit is the food. As I said, the food is always consistent. Everyone at my table thought their meals were very delicious. My salad, even after waiting an hour was perfect.

Like other Cheesecake factories, the menu is huge, and the portions are too. You better come hungry, because the food is ridiculous. It's a little bit pricey, but it's worth it considering you pretty much get two meals out of it. Plus, the honey wheat brown bread is amazing all on its own, and it comes free to the table. The service is always great at this location- they're always working fast and hard, and are always friendly.  Most recently, I went with two of my friends. We started with an appetizer, the Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread. It was unexpectedly awesome. It was super cheesy and garlicky, and is one of the best garlic breads I've ever had. I'd definitely order it again. One friend ordered the  Grilled Pork Chop with applesauce, mashed potatoes, and spinach. He devoured it, and thought it was exceptional. The other friend ordered the Fried Shrimp Platter, which is the only thing she ever orders there, so she thought it was great. I ordered my favorite Chicken Madeira, which was delicious as always.

I guess it's all about packing them in like sardines.

There was all that dining space upstairs - empty...  Our waiter didn't pull the chair for me, which I thought was what was supposed to happen in an upscale ""downtown"" restaurant, especially, when the older person is closest to you. And speaking of age... although, not major, my daughter who does have a young face, wasn't carded! Her pride was offended - but not their fault - she's getting older and looks 21+. The silverware wasn't clean as was the menu. The food was their regular, (like the Oakbrook location) - so I'm of the mind they can do this with their eyes closed. It was tasty, once home the avocado rolls didn't re-heat too well - again this is not their fault, however, since I had eaten lite I was looking forward to a dessert, so I was shocked when the waiter assumed we were not having a dessert and came with the check. No dessert menu. I didn't request the check. I got the feeling he thought it was time to turn the table over for his next tip - I don't know what he thought but I did want my dessert - really it's my main treat for going out - especially to the CHEESECAKE FACTORY! I asked for the dessert menu and ordered my dessert, paid, left a decent tip, even with poor service. The end. I'll return to the Oakbrook location, even though it's a trek now that I'm a Chicagoan again, but the service is better and that is huge on my list - next to quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=100

Went on a Tuesday so the place wasn't insanely crowded or anything so we were seated pretty quickly but only after snob city president (the hostess) took our party info. Oh and when you first walk in, despite employees running around like ants, no one tells you where the hell to check in at. The setup is a little funky. After being seated and waiting for an eternity we finally get to meet our waiter who is a first class AHOLE!Just an angry young man with a negative, snippy vibe. We were out and in a good mood and this guy just murdered that. Our drinks took, you guessed it, forever, to get there and they were obviously rushed. After having placed our order the manager, I think, comes over and tells us 2 out of the 4 items we ordered aren't available per the chef- so we just say thanks but we're leaving and he seems to have trouble processing this because his eyes roll and he repeats 'so you're leaving 'like 2-3 times . He doesn't ask why or for feedback. Oh, and we never got our bread. The Chicago chain should be ashamed of themselves. In the heart of the city with options all around and they aren't on their A game?! Y'all are gonna end up like Applebee's if you're not careful. Bottom line is that, again, with all the options so near by this can't be your go-to for a meal out in the city. Totally bummed I wasted my hard earned money on parking when we didn't even stay. Oh and it's super dark inside- like a little too dark. Almost need your cell phone flashlight to read the menu dark. What are they hiding in that low light?

Alan F.,"Hercules, CA",67,383,62,4.0,12/29/2015,"Located on the sunken plaza at the base of the John Hancock Center.  A somewhat dark room, with daylight from windows on the plaza not penetrating far into the labyrinthine interior.  Decoratively a bit unsettling, full of pink, bulgy organic shapes--Jonah might have felt right at home. We arrived around 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was crowded to the point of discomfort, but we were handed a pager, and seated within about 20 minutes.  Our server came at once, though the food was then rather slow to be delivered. The menu is typical of the Cheesecake Factory chain:  Lots of variety, most things dependably well-executed, portions probably too damned big.  We ordered a couple of old favorites, and a couple of things new to us: - Taco sampler.  Four different kinds of tacos with four dipping sauces.  Adequate as an appetizer for two, and could serve as a perfectly satisfactory entree for one. - Thai lettuce wraps.  My wife's go-to Cheesecake Factory choice.  Delicious and messy; a few toothpicks might help with some of the structural engineering problems. - Cashew chicken.  Big chunks of sautéed white-meat chicken, cashews, green onions, white and black sesame seeds; rather dry, but what sauce there was, was mildly spicy.  Choice of white or brown rice.  Pretty good, though many Chinese restaurants do this sort of thing better.  Probably not something I'd order again, with so many other dishes waiting to be tried. - Mango Key lime cheesecake.  Our usual favorite from among the large selection of the house's eponymous specialty. Restrooms clean, but at least one of the stalls in the men's room was out of toilet paper; this had not been corrected fifteen minutes after being called to the attention of a server.

We wanted to sit outside and then she told us that there would be wait for a table (but we clearly saw that there was available seating outside and NO ONE in line to be sat), then she continued her conversation with her co-workers about some lady that was super picky about seating (NOT a conversation you should be having when guests are around you #sideconvos).  When we finally did sit, our server was extremely inattentive. We didn't even receive cups of water until a buser came by to ask us if we were okay.

However, I've been informed that I was missing out.\ So, during my trip to Chicago, when I spied a Cheesecake Factory at the base of the John Hancock Observatory close to my hotel, I decided to pick up something for dessert after my evening meal. I headed to the bakery section and was confronted by a bewildering array of cheesecakes. Apparently, they have more different types of cheesecakes than Baskin Robbins have flavours of ice cream. I can well believe it! I asked the server for advice and he recommended the red velvet - that way, I had the cake layer of red velvet to eat and also the famous cheesecake layers between the cake. Well, the portion was enormous! I'm not sure how people eat a main course and then fit one of these in. I actually ate the cheesecake over 2 days. It was tasty in a sinful sort of way. However, too much of it would give you a major sugar rush! So, I've finally done it and eaten from the Cheesecake Factory.

My friend and I went on Wednesday night and the place was pretty busy, not to mention...it's HUGE. It was freezing outside and snowing heavily. They seated us at a nice table right by the window (which in my opinion is one of the only spots I would ever sit). The views are nice and with the snow falling it was nice and peaceful.  Our waiter was really friendly and he helped us narrow down some items on the menu. Did I mention that this menu has the most serious case of A.D.D that I've ever seen? They have Italian food, Asian, Mexican, American...possibly more..but I started losing patience. I've never seen so many random items at one place. I guess they have over 200 menu options. I would much rather go to a place that specializes in one type of cuisine (otherwise I wonder about quality control).  We ordered some Pot Stickers, Thai Lettuce Wraps and Roasted Stuffed Dates. I was impressed. The stuffed Dates were wrapped in Bacon and they had a great combination of sweet and salty taste. The Thai Lettuce Wraps is what I really enjoyed. The Peanut sauce is to die for and the chicken had a great marinade on it. All of the apps were pretty simple. After the apps, we were stuffed, so I can't comment on the entrees or sandwiches but the Cheesecake is something I was personally looking forward to!  I get excited when restaurants have a nice list of coffee drinks (especially when it's collld out). I had the Cafe Mocha with the following Cheesecake selections: Lemon Rasberry Creme, Peppermint Bark and the Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple. Of course the Peanut Butter was my favorite...but they were all SO good. Bad news for those of us trying to stick to a healthy diet, but a little slice of heaven here and there wont kill me! The overall ambience of the place wasn't bad either, but for the most part I try to stay away from the tourist-trap dining establishments on Michigan Ave during most times of the year.  If you're wondering what all that gold chrome all over the place is, I was wondering the same thing. I felt like I was inside a pie (the waiter told us it was supposed to be the inside of a Cheesecake) hmm..either way, cool place for a tourist-trap chain.

I guess its like Moroccan under a big mushroom. Not sure, very dim and dated. I thought it was an upscale place, but they serve water in a plastic mug and offer generic american food. We ordered a pizza and burger and shared. I didn't know something so basic could end up so wrong. The pizza had literally no cheese and tasted like it was frozen. The burger was the worst. the bread was so hard I bit down and thought I chipped my tooth. The processed cheese seemed like it was left out for days and harden. I just took everything off and picked at the meat. We ordered a cheesecake which was great, but didn't make up for everything else.

Theresa C.,"Naperville, IL",137,427,51,2.0,1/3/2011,"I was surprised on a busy Saturday night (and New Year's Eve no less) the wait for a table was only 45 minutes. My friend and I decided that Cheesecake Factory would be a perfect base for our night of drinking ahead. That's where the pluses end. We must've had the biggest space cadet for a waitress. First it took a long time for her to come over and take our drink/dinner order. But she was forgiven for that since it was so busy. We then get our drinks and a promise that the bread would be right out. Normally I'm not into bread but since both of us were hungry, we were kinda looking forward to it. So here starts the crisis: the waitress comes by three more times to say the bread will ""be right out if the oven."" She then goes on to say how the whole wheat bread is delicious and it's so good but she's still waiting for it to come out. Seriously what the fuck? You don't tell a table of hungry people that the bread is delicious but sorry you don't have any yet. I could really give two rat asses about the bread but it was built up so much, I wanted some. So we were figuring the entrees would arrive before the bread, which they did. And the fresh baked bread? Cold. But wait, I thought it was right out of the oven? My entrees wasn't any better. When I go to CF I usually get the Baja chicken tacos because they're consistently yummy. These tacos were so bland, it wasn't funny. The portions were huge but had no flavor. Such a disappointment because the entree is really delicious when made right. The beans and rice were the highlight of the dish and that was sad. All in all, the service sucked, the place was about 500 degrees and the tables were so close together. Nothing like putting my ass in someone's face when I needed to get out to use the restroom.   The only plus is there's a bevy of hot guys. My friend got a good look at one of the blondes.

Ordered Godiva cheesecake to go, which should come with a square of Godiva chocolate, nowhere to be found. Awful service, I'm highly disappointed.

Love their fries, sandwiches, and their pasta carbonara in particular! I don't branch out much on the menu because we really just go for the cheesecake. They have this one covered in caramel right now that is to die for. Honestly (and perhaps sadly) still one of our favorite places to eat in Chicago after living here for years.  Unfortunately, there is just about always a huge wait (45-hour) but it's a huge chain and its in the heart of Michigan ave. so it's honestly to be expected.

Luckily, my mother and I grabbed a table in the bar section (first come/first serve) within about 10 minutes of arriving.  SERVICE: BAD! Our waiter seemed to be out of it. Every time we asked for something he forgot. It would take 2-3 times asking or having to ask another sever before getting something.  FOOD: I ordered a Kid's gluten-free pasta with Alfredo. My mother had Spaghetti with Meatball which she liked. When my pasta came out it was not done with a hard texture. I know GF has a different texture but this was terrible! I sent it back and within 10-15mins I had a fresh bowl. This was somewhat better but not the best GF pasta I have had. Thankfully the manager took off my pasta! CHEESECAKE: This restaurant has one cheesecake that is currently gluten-free: Godiva Chocolate. It is delicious and definitely the best part of the meal. Also, because it is National Cheesecake Day it was half-price!  I would recommend skipping the food and maybe going for dessert.

We were sat at table 70 something.  Then we watched as two other tables were sat nearby and greeted quickly. We came hungry and left hungry and without service 15 min later.  We let the hostess know and all she had to say was ""That's weird."" Very disappointed.  I understand mistakes happen but each of the past few time we've been there we have seen fellow diners walk out without service.  We come for the food but we won't be back because the service is subpar.  Also they should invest in a person to polish the  silverware. This time I actually had chunks of food stuck to my cutlery.

The tomato, basil, and cheese pizza was soggy (like fall off the crust soggy) and the Cajun Chicken ""Littles"" were dry, and trying to eat them was like attempting pound down charred bark mixed with broken glass, and the included mashed potatoes were the consistency of kindergarden crafting paste.   So, the one good thing that is constantly good about this Cheesecake Factory is the service.  The waitstaff is typically always upbeat, regardless of how busy the place is.   So, given the opportunity, skip it.  The foods expensive for what you get, regardless of portion size.  Plus, there are far better eateries within a block of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=460
Nicole W.,"Baltimore, MD",34,33,4,1.0,9/16/2013,"I was on my way shopping and tried to convince my boyfriend to go to The Cheesecake Factory because from my experiences in other areas, they aren't ""that bad"". I should've just kept walking! To preface, I am NOT a picky eater nor do I like to complain at all. Went in, sat near the bar, he ordered a Fat Tire (bottled) and I ordered a Goose Island Draft (the 32 oz). Since we were sitting near the bar, I sat and watched the bartender pour my draft which just foamed up. All foam. Top to bottom. Guy just left it there. Server came by and said they had to switch the tap so I said, ""Sure, as long as I can get a new beer and not the one sitting there."" He agreed and eventually I got my beer. But, the issue was, the bartender decided to just ADD to my foam that had been sitting there as foam slowly turning into beer for 15 minutes. The beer was rather warm and nasty. Server came back, I asked for a new beer, and received new beer somewhat correct (the bottled beer was WAY colder than the draft beer). By then it was after my apps came out that I finally received my beer. It was 20 minutes to receive a beer. It was also very weird that when I went to tell my server about the beer all I had to do was say ""excuse me"" and he goes, ""Is your beer warm?"" like he already knew.... For dinner, I ordered the Chicken Tacos. They brought out shrimp then came back with the correct ones after saying that I ordered chicken. Bit into the tacos and started to wonder why they tasted funny. Turns out the taco shells were stale! Told the server, and the poor guy just can see it and feel it.... the look on his face. Thankfully he comped the tacos because by then, I really did not want to eat there. The people were nice but it is rather clear there is something wrong with their managers (a bartender who can't pour beer and a kitchen that can't keep taco shells fresh).  I say go anywhere -except- there. TL;DR: Ordered beer, got warm foam-beer. Ordered tacos, got stale shells.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=460

I was pleased that I only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table because when I saw the brouhaha inside I was assuming at least a 30 - 40 minute wait. Once seated, we ordered a few drinks, strawberry and raspberry martinis, both incredibly tasty. As a guy, by social pressure and choice, I don't usually order martinis but I was on vacation, so I gave in and was not disappointed. They make 'em pretty strong so be prepared for a nice long meal. At lunch, be sure to look at the specials in addition to the normal offerings. The menu is so expansive that it took me several minutes just to order a drink. Once our food arrived, I heard only compliments about each dish: ""This pasta is glorious!"", ""I thought you could only get jambalaya likes this in Louisiana!"", ""It's like every food I like is partying on this sandwich!"". Stuff to that effect. And of course, we had to order at least one slice of cheesecake, chocolate mousse.

Sat at the bar and was greeted immediately by the bartender. Order a Titos Vodka with cranberry and a fresh lime. The lime never made it on the glass. No big deal I would survive. Decided on the grilled fish tacos. By this time my glass was empty! Gave the bartender my food order with the hopes that he would notice the empty glass. No such luck today. I give it a few minute more and finally I ask for a refill on the Titos. Again no lime! Fast forward 20 minutes and still no food. I notice a few people who came in after me getting food, so I ask are the tacos coming soon? ""yes I sent someone to check on them."" the bartender replied as he turn to a passing server and says ""hey can you check on grilled fish tacos?"". About four minutes later a runner appears with the tacos. I dig into the black beans n rice, and they are luke warm at best. Okay you got me. They were cool at best. I attempted to eat the tacos, which were flavorful and well presented. I picked one up and the tortilla fell apart and the fish was cold. Warning! These tacos had been setting under a heatlamp for sometime getting cold and saturated with moisture. If I had more time I would've waited for them to fix the dish. Unfortunately I was meeting a friend at another location so my quick dinner turned into a ""I wish it was a better experience"". The bartender sends for the manager and this took forever. Finally he (manager) arrives, but the bartender had left to find him. The who's on second scenario. Long story short I recieved no apology from tha manager and he seemed annoyed that his system that clearly failed me created more work for him.

Kate S.,"Memphis, TN",0,13,3,3.0,11/27/2012,"We went to this place last night and it was packed to the max! We were told that we would be waiting for approx. 30 minutes, which ended up to be 50 minutes. The good thing was that we were given a beeper, so we could go outside to take pictures in front of Christmas tree and the little train installation at the second entrance. As at every Cheesecake Factory, the menu was extensive and it took me another 15 minutes to decide. The Avocado Egg Role was as expected delicious, particularly with the sweet sauce it comes with. The Hibachi steak I ordered was decent, so were the wasabi mashed potatoes. Everything a little unspectacular, but we didn't expect more from a chain like this. However, the selection of ice creams was a bit disappointed, but once ordered the Godiva chocolate brownie sunday ice cream thingy, it made up for it in size. It could've fed two tables actually. At the end we ordered two cheesecakes, the low carb and the banana one, and they really were the highlight of our breakfast table next morning. All in all, our waitress was friendly and casual, the food is decent, the selection extensive, but nothing special. The waiting and the place being so packed, was not great though, to say the least. Just order some cheesecake here and take it home to enjoy with a good movie. P.s. Don't take your date here! Although the lights are dim, there're more romantic and private places.

I have twice ordered the Thai lettuce wraps which are incredibly difficult to eat but the flavors are so good, I love them.  Yes, your hands will be sticky but just ask for a wet nap and they provide you with warmed wet linen napkins.  Very nice, thank you very much.  The lettuce wrap is colorful and fresh and light but filling.  It comes on a large platter with piles of julienned carrots, chopped cucumbers, cilantro, marinated chicken pieces, bamboo shoots and three Thai dipping sauces, the peanut butter chili sauce being my favorite. Of the three cheesecakes I've had on my last three recent visits, Chocolate Reeses Peanut butter cheesecake, Red Velvet cheesecake and Chocolate Candy Bar cheesecake; the Red Velvet was definitely my favorite.  The other two being just a bit too dense and rich even after fresh salad.

The first time I visited this chain I had to wait about 50+ minutes or so to be seated, which strikes me as a ridiculous wait time for a chain restaurant. Will I wait 50+ minutes for a table at The Aviary? Absolutely. Will I wait 50+ minutes for a table at the Cheesecake Factory again? No way.  To be fair, the Cheesecake Factory does, well, as you would imagine, have decent cheesecakes. I tried the Godiva cheesecake and well you can't go wrong with anything that has Godiva chocolate in it. Yet in general, the size of portions is simply off-putting - someone described it well in a previous review - it's like they're yelling ""AMERICA!!!"" in your face x20. I have a tough time eating that much in one sitting, and I usually have a large appetite. Also, I hate low ceilings and overly crowded places - so The Cheesecake Factory is really not my cup of tea.

Javier Q.,"Chicago, IL",70,70,1,1.0,4/7/2011,"This review is not about eating here but working for Cheesecake Factory. I was excited to work for such a big company and show case my skills as a cook. I learned about 20 items for the particular station, but the only main skill would be is BE EXTREMELY FAST. More of an intense labor, I didn't feel respected as an individual, but treated more like a number, or a robot of some sort. Breaks here DO NOT exist, you would work your whole entire shift without a break. I felt extremely bad for the employees who stayed in the back and rolled silverware all day without being offered drinks or food. I remember working 14 hours, and ONLY having a 30 minute break.  May I add that the pay is not good, I did expect more of Cheesecake Factory to pay their workers more money than a ""slow commercial restaurant"" As fast-paced and POPULAR this place is, PENNIES are giving to their employees for all the hard work they do on a daily basis. I'm sorry but the owner's of Cheesecake Factory seem to be very selfish and find it RIDICULOUS to not pay employees for holidays. You expect ME TO WORK ON CHRISTMAS DAY WITHOUT getting paid more? HA! You must be joking! This place is not worth applying nor working for. If you enjoy being a ""ROBOT"" go ahead and work here. This place was by far the worst place I ever worked for, my voice has to be heard as I don't allow big companies not appreciating their employees for all the work they are doing to keep it running. REMEMBER, if it wasn't for the worker's there, there won't be no successful business as the worker's are the one's that bust their behinds for the pennies that they get because the Owner's of the company are very selfish individuals that don't care about no one else but themselves.  And some advice, DON'T come bring your family when it's very busy  here as if the food falls onto the floor they will pick it up and put it right on your plate. They simply have no time to make a brand new order.  This is simply my opinion, and freedom of speech.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=460

I find this place hard to rate because it varies so much. I've had some experiences better than others.   I do love their cheesecake and will pay the $6-7 for it.  I normally always get the Strawberry because it's classic, but this time I ventured out of my comfort zone and got the White Chocolate Blueberry. Amazing!  Somehow when people visit, they always want to come here since no one has been.  If it is going to be a chain, I'd prefer this one over others. We went for a late lunch is to avoid all the tourists (at 1:45 it was still busy but no wait).    Their service (2 stars)... is medicore. This past time it was okay, but the waiter seemed rushed to get us out. When you want to enjoy lunch and good company, the last thing you want to be is rushed . There isn't enough staff for the volumne that they get there.  The food was decent. I had the BBQ Chicken salad which was pretty tasty although it could have been more favorful.  The dressing was good but the greens were too plain for what you pay for. I did not like that some of the lettuce did not seem as fresh (NOT GOOD).  My friend ordered the pasta carbonara and really enjoyed it.  Had the food not been on the pricey side, I'd probably get 3, but for that, the stuff should be more than decent. I should no better though since it is on Michigan Ave. Overall, I would definitely go back for their cheesecake.  Most likely, I'd eat elsewhere and get it to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=460
Blanca S.,"Chicago, IL",31,17,23,3.0,12/22/2013,"I have very mix reviews and feelings about the Cheesecake Factory. This review is for the downtown location which I visited this past week. We grabbed lunch around 12 o'clock so we waited a tad few. No biggie. Mind you I could see that the restaurant wasn't at full capacity, but I digress. Our server seemed very heavy footed and I could feel him reading me like a book. As if he somehow knew these two Mexicans weren't going to tip him the appropriate amount compared to his more sophisticated white tables. Turns out he was just a flat out horrid server. He did these super long pauses between dropping off drinks, bread, appetizers and taking our lunch order. Last time I was here the waitress was so helpful. She told us about the soup of the day the specials and even recommended her favorite dishes. So friendly and attentive. Total opposite from my most current experience.  He didn't tell us anything but the soup of the day. He said the sod was clam chowder and that it was the only soup available in a very harsh monotone. As if saying we better not even think about wanting something different or else. Yikes. We started off with stuffed mushrooms and the crab bites. This day the mushrooms had a funny taste, sort of like old mushrooms. They didn't taste fresh which it why I usually order them. The crab bites are always delightful. Very crispy on the outside but moist on the inside.  When dinning at The Cheesecake Factory I usually get the pasta carbonara. The sauce in the pasta is very delicious. Very very calorie filled but very delicious in deed. Peas and bacon, How can you go wrong?  I decided to try something new. The Shepard pot pie screamed my name. Mushrooms, carrots, squash, ground beef, mash potatoes , yum! The dish was very savory. I really wish it had some sort of pastry crust. That would of definitely brought the dish together.  I forgot what my bf had. He liked it. Something Cajun maybe I can't remember. Ha.  To quickly sum my experience up I had a nice lunch for the exception of our server. I only saw him hovering over us when he wanted us to pay the bill.

Completely different experience. The staff wasn't as friendly. Food was overly salty. I got the petite filet and the outside was charred and burnt. Side choices are poor. No option for baked potato or side salad. Couldn't read the menu because the light above us was burned out. We mentioned it to our waiter and 3 others. One employee said it has been like that for awhile and it bugs her too. Had to wait over 15 min just to get our cheesecake at the end.

I tried two different pastas, and I really liked both of them, especially the Chicken Chipotle Pasta which I thought sounded okay, but tasted pretty great.

Courtney W.,"Brandon, FL",1216,580,84,3.0,12/3/2012,"This place is like tourist central in Chicago. It's below the Hancock and people just can't help themselves. Personally, when I travel to a city I try to eat some of the food that has made it famous or is unique to that location so I don't quite understand the rush to this place but who am I to judge. I've been here and I've waited almost an hour to be seated since they don't take reservations. Unlike other locations, you can stray too far from the bar area or your pager won't go off. It kind of feels like a cave in here since you are pretty much in the ground and the base of the Hancock. They have everything that all of the other CFs have and I normally go with quesadillas or the bow tie pasta chicken dish. It's easy to split something here or order an entree for yourself and be prepared to have lunch for at least a day or two on leftovers alone. The menu here is ridiculous. If you can't find something on it, you need to never eat out again because you will never be happy anywhere. The cheesecake is slightly overpriced but they come in way too many flavors to count.

My friends ordered a pasta dish to split between the two of them. Our food was ready in about twenty-five minutes. About 5 minutes more and I would have passed out from sheer hunger.

Their menu is abnormally large, which can be great, but if you don't necessarily know what you want, it can take a while to make a selection. The service is usually very good; however, they are usually always packed so expect at least a 30-40 minute wait. They do not allow reservations after 5pm.

Jordan Mozer's cartoon interior isn't holding up so well with time, starting to show a bit of age and wear. I had such a crush on Chicago's Bad Boy of Architecture in the 80s.

I ordered the chicken madeira and steak diane combo and had a slice of caramel apple cheesecake. Oh and also a peach bellini. I can say that the drink was enjoyable, although I suspect it had very little, if any liquor in it at all, and this is from someone who rarely drinks.  The chicken dish was more cheese than dish and the steak was not done the way I had asked it to be. The crab appetizer tasted like toast. The cajun chicken pasta was very heavy but not too bad. The service could have been better.

Lisa B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",298,393,3,3.0,12/31/2009,"Why do people wait an hour or more to eat here? That is the question. My excuse was that I had signed up with a secret shopper organization, and was getting a $40 gift card for my trouble. I figured, I'm reviewing things anyway, might as well receive some remuneration, right? One of the rules was I had to go for dinner at a particular time, and apparently 6:00 p.m. was when everyone in the world came downtown to hit the after-Christmas sales. I was not thrilled to wait an hour for a table, but rules are rules. The nice lady at the hostess desk informed me that the buzzer would not work outside the restaurant. She did not inform me that the upstairs cafe -- with its shorter menu and shorter wait -- was an option.  I had to figure that out on my own. The decor of this place is so bizarre -- the puffy tubelike ceiling made me think of intestines, and all the food moving through them. Ew.  Our service was delightful and the food was not half bad.  I really enjoyed my Cashew Chicken Salad, though I would venture to guess that about half the cashews were peanuts. And the cheesecake?

The place is huge and it looks like you are walking through a maze, but all the tables are so close to each other that it gives you a feeling of chaos.  They do not take reservations on the weekends and we waited for about 25 minutes, which was not too bad. They have a lot of seating available for people waiting for a table, but it literally looks like there are 50 people ahead of you. I was hungry and seeing all those people was a cause for concern. Anyway, we got to sit at a booth and I immediately felt claustrophobic. While the tables are quite large, the seat area is very cramped. We had our winter coats with us and had to hang them off the side of the booth, otherwise, we wouldn't fit comfortably. Our waiter was nice, but clearly busy, but we are not ones to make small talk anyway. Our food took a while. Probably around 40 minutes... I dunno, I lost track of time. The food was a hit for 2 out of 4 in our party. I guess the menu is a hit or miss. By the way, the menu is incredibly long. Most of the items there are 2000+ calories, but if you are not one to diet occasionally, you have nothing to worry about. My choices were limited to fish and salads.

Jacques M.,"Chicago, IL",89,220,38,3.0,2/27/2010,"Let me first start by saying I'm not big on the whole ""rate chains low"" anti corporate sentiment.  For me good food is good food.  That being said Cheesecake factory has its high and low points.         As other reviewers of have stated Cheesecake Factory offers large portions of standard American fare.  Despite the large portions, I'm still not sure I want to shell out $14 to $16 for Fried Fish, Chicken Fingers, and other easy to come by standard dishes (although I have).  The dishes, while not a great bargain, are always pretty decent (albeit nothing to get excited about). However, Cheesecake Factory (at least this location) features one of my pet peeves. I simply can't stand it when restaurants do not put prices next to their beer. It puts you in that awkward situation (if you want beer), do I ask for the price and look like a cheap skate (especially on a date) or do I risk paying $7 for a bud light?          As far as the cheesecake goes, it is really good. I've had the Godiva Chocolate & Some type of Cookie Dough Cheesecake both came in generous tasty portions. This is the restaurants strong point (hints the name Cheesecake Factory).           The service at this location is excellent. The hostess was very friendly and the server was also friendly and attentive. If you hate tourists (or at least eating with them) don't go here.  Atmosphere is strange in an interesting way (I think it's supposed to be cheesecakes coming out of the walls and ceilings??)              Overall, I give it a solid 3 star rating.

I have a friend who had never been and i'm sure going was on her ""must do before I die list"" so we went.  The cheesecake is quite good and they have tons of different ones (snickers, ahem). BUT the food is absolutely terrible. The one in schaumburg had better food and that isn't saying much. I ordered pasta and it was undercooked and crunchy, the sauce was watered down and it was flavorless and gross. I immediately asked to order something else and the staff was very nice and accommodating (read: I don't think they spit in my food).  My new order was a turkey burger and while it wasn't gross it just wasn't much of anything: turkey and buns...no WOW unless tomato and sad looking lettuce is their idea of wow.  If you can order the cheesecake to-go then please do. The food is really not worth it and there are better places within spitting distance of this place.

Rob M.,"Overland Park, KS",160,309,1,4.0,8/13/2012,"This location of Cheesecake Factory, located at the base of the John Hancock Tower, must be a gold mine for the company!  It's absolutely packed all day long.  We decided to give it a try after a long day of sightseeing -- it's only a block from our hotel.   At 7:45 p.m. it was still crowded, but the wait was only about 20 minutes, and they have plenty of places to sit until your buzzer goes off.  Service was a little spotty when we first sat down -- the table wasn't completely set and the coffee I ordered was just lukewarm.  But things improved rapidly after that.  Our server was good about bringing anything that was lacking, including more bread and a new pot of good, hot coffee.   We split the ""appetizer"" size Caesar salad -- it's merely humongous.  NEVER order the full size Caesar here, unless you've brought along the Mexican Soccer Team to share it with you (the salad was invented in Tijuana, so it's not Italian, despite the name and ingredients)!  My BF ordered the wild mushroom burger, which came with a more-than-bountiful fountain of fries, and he just loved it!  I ordered the carbonara, made with fettucine instead of spaghettini, and it was good and filling but a bit blah, flavor-wise.  The sauce needed to be cheesier, I think.  True to form, it was an enormous portion that I couldn't finish.  We wrapped things up with a slice of their chocolate coconut cheesecake, which came with two giant dollops of whipped cream.  The cheesecake was dense and rich and coconutty, on a chocolate crust.  We finished about half of it and brought the rest back to our hotel for a midnight snack.   All in all a pretty good experience.  Cheesecake Factory is good for basic kinds of foods, mostly well prepared, with a rather wide variety of choices, so it's especially good if you're with a group that's not quite sure what it wants!  Entrees are certainly more than large enough to split.  The cheesecake, of course, is excellent and available in many, many flavors (the Godiva chocolate one is total decadence).  Service is good, and prices are moderate to pricey, depending on what you order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=540

The clientele was coarse, and ill-mannered. The 3 individuals seated in the neighboring booth had an occupant who kept shaking her leg. When my husband leaned back to stop himself from being shook, the female reprimanded him for doing so, and started yelling very loud.

Joe B.,"Chicago, IL",0,24,,1.0,6/25/2014,"My late wife and I had eaten at Cheesecake hundreds of times after Cheesecake opened in the Hancock. We worked late night. So it was a great place to dine on quality food. When our daughter was born, we stopped going, and later, we went to more neighborhood restaurants. But last night, because we were out after 10,  I decided to bring my ten year old daughter to a place where her late beloved Mommy and I shared so many wonderful meals and times. As we left, my daughter asked me if Mommy and I had considered a divorce. Wow! Has this place gotten awful. The place had all kinds of open tables in rooms where people were seated. Yet we were told it would be a five to ten minute wait, which turned into fifteen minutes. The wait was the best part of the meal. It is clear that the staff culture has fallen off the cliff as witnessed by a group of staff members exchanging inappropriate chit chat/salacious gossip by the coffee bar despite the fact that we were within seven feet  ear shot.  Then there was the food and service. When we sat down, my daughter immediately spotted a dirty bread plate, for which I pointed it out to the server. It took five minutes, but eventually he replaced it. Never got regular water despite my request for it. (Hey. I am not interested in refilling my much smaller than it used to be Virgin Pina Colada.). Waiter took our order separately. Why I don't know. And then there was the food. My Tuna Ahi was the worst meal I have had in over ten years. It was the worst piece of tuna I have ever encountered in my life. I am truly ashamed of myself for having eaten it---such shame I have not felt since 30 years ago when I picked up a sweat hog at 2:00 am at Katzenjammers a long since closed Lincoln Park bar and spent the night with her. (And yes. That was the last time in my life when I ever got drunk.) And then came the fin de sicle--the cheesecakes. Not that bad. They seem to be a little lighter than they were, but they were OK. But the waiter (""Houdini"") should have sensed that all was not well when I ordered my check to come with the cheesecakes. Plain and simple.

Being late, I hurried to the Cheesecake Factory and entered through the upstairs entrance. The entire upstairs was abandoned, nary a sole and the lights were off with about a dozen or more tables and room to sit but no one manning the door. Getting the hint, I walked downstairs and saw empty rows of seating everywhere for noontime. I knew tourist season was over, but how could Cheesecake Factory be THIS empty!! After walking down through more of the restaurant I found someone who asked if I needed help, I kept on going and found my fam waving at me but was confused as no direct path was available and had to navigate through more zig zags and around the corners. When I sat down, the other table started waving trying to flag down their waiter and made fun that they had finally got his attention. I quickly ordered some  Tropical Iced Tea and we waited for our bread. Eventually the waiter came back and we ordered two platters of fried shrimp and a crab cake appetizer. The food came out relatively quickly and our drinks were refilled but the lunch entrees came before the bread did doh! The food was standard bar food and wasn't anything special in my opinion. It is typical American dining out fare, you will find much of the same at Red Lobster, Appleby's, TGIFriday's, Ruby Tuesday, etc. I kind of lump them all in the same category, nothing especially unique, but still good atmosphere and tasty unhealthy food when you feel like it.

The first restaurant we decided to dine at was the lovely Cheesecake Factory. Although it seemed busy, we were seated in a matter of minutes. The inside is dim but very nicely decorated and a lot of seating. We sat down, looked at the menus and... wow. Pages and pages of items to choose from, it was a booklet. We ordered our appetizers, I believe three of them. Holy cow they were good! As a seafood lover, I was pleased to see so many dishes available, and the prices were reasonable. No complaints about the food quality whatsoever. Next, dessert. You haven't seen a desert menu until you've looked at theirs. You will need more than a couple minutes to pick one or two out. Our cheesecakes were absolutely delicious, and we were beyond full. As I mentioned earlier, prices are reasonable, so our checks were average.

We waited over an hour to get a table which was fine, however when we were sat we waited an additional 10 minutes before we were even noticed. The sever asked us if we wanted water and then brought it to us after another longer wait. It got worse after that. He was inattentive and dismissive from then on. He never introduced himself or went over any specials. When we had planned to order 2 appetizers, but after my girlfriend ordered hers, the server ran off before I could order mine, and before we we could order our cocktails. We ordered our cocktails from another server because we could not get the attention of ours, when they were brought to us one was wrong.  The server alone made this night one that I wish to forget, he cost himself at least $30 in sales due to the appetizer ordeal, not telling us about the specials (we overheard another server explain that Clam Chowder was the soup and we both would have gotten that had we known) and it taking so long to get our cocktails.

Lucian I.,"Dearborn, MI",0,4,,2.0,5/28/2012,"Don't believe the hype. We went there on a visit to Chicago, because everybody told us we had to go there. The restaurant is a tourist spot, crowded, but we didn't have to wait long, about 10 mins. I hated the decor, they go for whimsy, it comes out tacky. The waiters are dressed in all white, and it makes them look like orderlies from a mental institution. The food was very unimpressive. The menu is huge, and you need a few minutes to get through it, especially if it's your first time there like it was for us. We had a BLT salad as an appetizer, which was good, and ordered 2 entrees from the seafood menu. The portions are huge (even the soft drinks came in a huge glass, probably somewhere around 30oz), and the food was ok, but nothing to make me go back there. I doubt that I will ever eat again in a Cheesecake Factory. It is overhyped and overpriced, especially since what they serve seems to be just glorified fast food. The cheesecake was good, but very, very expensive, at about $7-9 a slice. It didn't blow me away like I would expect for that price. You can find better, cheaper desserts at local Chicago restaurants. We ended up spending about $80 including tip and dessert, for something that was probably worth about half of that amount. In my opinion, you'd be better spending your money in a local restaurant, trying some of the local fare: there are lots of gems spread all around the city, where you can have a more pleasurable and satisfying experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=620

Jason S.,"Muscatine, IA",53,35,,3.0,1/18/2009,"When I lived in Chicago, I was so entranced by the thousands of choices available to me, I looked down my nose at any chain restaurant and seldom ate here.  However, now that I've spent the past eight years in culinary isolation in a smaller community, I don't mind this as much. So, while I enjoyed visiting some old favorites when back in town--I did enjoy making a trek here for what I knew would be some reliable tasty food and a good dessert. As all of the other reviews mention--portions here are gigantic. Unless you are absolutely starving, I'd skip appetizers and go for the main course and cheesecake--or go for apps and main dish, but no dessert. Or, you could do what I did, ordering apps and a main dish and getting my cheesecake to go (a decadent breakfast!) The decor is odd at this one, as well as other CF's that I've been in. I describe it as ""Help, I'm trapped in a cheesecake"" decor. Our server, when asked, described it as a dessert fantasy. I'd call it cheesey, but the pun is too obvious. The fried Macaroni and Cheese balls sound disgusting, but are actually very good. The Thai Lettuce rolls are also a good choice. I was with a group of eight, and we ordered two of the ""factory appetizer favorites"" for the table--a good way to sample the wares. For dinner, I've had great luck with the pasta dishes, meats, and specifically the meatloaf. I'm not sure why someone would come here and not order the cheesecake! My favorites are the dulce de leche, white chocolate raspberry truffle, Key Lime, and Dutch Apple Caramel. We were here on the night of a blizzard warning which appeared to thin down the crowds considerably. In fact, it might be my only visit here that didn't come with at least a 45 minute wait. There are a ton of better options in Chicago. But, if you are here for a few days, and want one-night to be a no pressure day that will please everyone in your party with its diverse menu, the Cheesecake Factory will be a good choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=620

Tam T.,"Louisville, KY",29,19,,1.0,8/1/2012,"So the update to the less than expected service. After writing the review and sending it to Cheesecake, I received a phone call from Nick (their manager apparently who doesn't seem to be in office that often), who informed me of his sadness to hear my bad experience. He gave me his number and told me to call back to discuss the matter. Upon receiving the message, I proceeded to call Nick back to be greeted by one of the staff, who told me that she does not know of anyone by that name that works at the Cheesecake. I listened to the message again and tried the other number instead of the caller ID number, which went to Bryan (a staff member). This time Bryan placed me on hold for 10 minutes after he said he will try to find Nick for me. I was then disconnected. I gave them a benefit of a doubt and called back. Bryan responded by saying Nick was not there.... The PLOT THICKENS! I called back next day and got a girl (Jessica), who said that Nick was not in again. Surprisingly, a manager seems to not do much at the factory. As I type this update, I am on hold for 20 minutes already on the following day after Bryan answered and told me to wait while he tries to see if Nick is in. Now this is just purely amusement on my part at this point. Let's see what corporate will do when this is sent to them.

Unlike the Oakbrook location however this location is a bit on the tight side. tables are very close togather and it almost feels more like a mess hall than a resturant.

My friend joked that we would get it after our auntrees and that is exactly what happened. The best part was she claimed it was in the oven but when it came it was cold... That must be the fastest cooling bread ever. I honestly think she kept forgetting to bring it and it was New years eve so I can totally let this one slide by. I ordered the Cheeseburger. Little did I know what kind of Beefcake I really ordered as my meal was delivered by a super hot blond food runner. Honestly this location gets points just for that :) My food came fresh and hot.

Kate N.,"Chicago, IL",85,47,,1.0,6/19/2008,"Caveat: This review goes for all Cheesecake locations, and I'm writing it because my friends and family are done listening to my rants on the subject. If you have a strong loyalty to the Cheesecake Factory, perhaps you should go read something else. Just a thought.  I remember the first time I went to a Cheesecake Factory -- it was in Jersey, in a mall. Even as a surly 13 year old with the palate sophistication of an alley cat, I was entirely underwhelmed. There was no sense of being momentarily welcomed into a respite from the world, like you experience at truly good restaurants at any price range. There was a weird taste coating my mouth when we finished.  This uneasy feeling -- as if I'm dining on a movie set and everything looks real, but isn't -- has only grown with the numerous work-sponsored ""team bonding"" lunches at CF's I've had to endure over the years. The conclusion I've come to is that, like so many other restaurants, CF is pure mediocrity and it simply exhausts me.  CF should accept the fact that it is on par with an Applebee's or Friendly's. At least those places don't attempt to be anything they're not! The food is no better and neither is the service. And at CF, you have to try to stomach that Wal-Martized version of fine dining decor.  Larger portions do not = better quality. Really. The price might be right, but those massive piles of cardboard doused in fat and sugar are all that is wrong with America.  Why on EARTH would you want to eat somewhere called a ""factory""? Go out and pick up Pollan's ""Omnivore's Dilemma."" Try and tell me, after reading it, that you want to put something that ADMITS to being straight from a factory in your mouth! (Even if you're not going to tell me anything of the sort, read the book anyway.) As I write this, I realize that many will wonder why I care. ""If you don't like it, don't go there!"" (You were thinking that. I know.) And you have a point. However, I think what I'm really railing against here is the sense that people don't demand better food, atmosphere, service. No one thinks twice about spending their money on something perhaps temporarily tasty but ultimately insubstantial, and that's why these places exist. These mediocre restaurants keep popping up like mushrooms, and eventually people start to think its the norm.  For the price of a CF meal, you can easily feast somewhere more genuine, if you're willing to look. So, no, I won't go to CF anymore. I'll skip the office birthday and ""so sorry you're leaving us"" celebrations. I'll just hope that people start putting their feet down before all the real places are stamped out by these alien, heartless, species.

Blair M.,"Chicago, IL",174,20,1,5.0,3/2/2010,"Few restaurants are as distinctive and memorable as the Cheesecake Factory. While they are a restaurant chain, Chicago has one unique from all others. It's #12 in the chain, making it one of the older, more original designs, according to a Cheesecake employee Chicago's Cheesecake Factory brings about thoughts of a whimsical fairy tale. Low lighting brings about ambience, and a generally warm environment is extremely welcoming. People have described it to me as ""A real-life Fern Gully,"" ""The underground level of Mario Bros,"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.""  Mushroom-shaped lights sit on the tables, and they alone cost a couple thousand dollars, according to an employee. The rest of the restaurant is made of flowing, non-linear shapes. A 21-page menu (with its own advertising) furthers this feeling of coziness. Offerings vary from appetizers, and light meals to hefty full-course offerings. They boast over 200 menu items. My buddy and I sampled the Calamari, which was served with a creamy garlic sauce and a marinara sauce. The Calamari was perfectly crisp, although the serving size was a bit small. Service at the Cheesecake Factory is notoriously amazing, and for good reason. Employees go through a 400-question test, and they have to get a 90% of better to pass, according to Jennifer Sotelo, a waitress and trainer at the Factory. ""What I tell all my trainees- 'you may be part-time, but during training you must be full-time,'"" Sotelo said. Our waiter, a young man by the name of Tom Schabow, has been with the Factory for a month. He described his experience as ""scary,"" though he has grown more comfortable in his position. He took excellent care of us, and was extremely gracious as we took a ridiculous amount of time to select our food. There is, of course, the cheesecake. They have over 30 varieties. Every offering is excellent, although our waiter recommended the Adams Peanut Butter Ripple. So. Good. We split the cake, and still found it to be a lot to eat. The total came to $27.71, which included Calamari, a soft drink, a beer, and a large piece of cheesecake.

Xavier R.,"Chicago, IL",3,3,1,1.0,1/2/2011,"Wow, what to say... Let me first say that this place isn't even deserving of a single star.  I recently came here for my friends birthday. Out of the three of us who went, neither of us had tried the cheesecake factory, so we thought we should see what the big deal is. The wait was 40 minutes, but I expected that, especially from a chain restaurant. I had a gut feeling this would be a bad experience from how noisy it was, not to mention we were seated right by the kitchen where they drop dishes every minute. We waited about 10 minutes for the waiter to come by and take our orders for drinks. He takes another 10 minutes bringing our drinks.  This is where it all falls apart. I ordered the meatloaf (don't ask), the birthday girl orders shrimp pasta, and my friend orders a grilled cheese. So after he takes our orders he tells us he would bring us bread, about 10 minutes go by and no bread. We had to pull him out of his way to ask him for the bread and refills, then he says ""Oh, You wanted bread?!"". We just sat there looking at each other like ""REALLY?!"".. So eventually brings us some damn bread, but no refills. Then my friend's pasta finally comes, while me and my other friend are still waiting for our food. They told us our food would be ready in just a couple of minutes about 3 times, like I really believed that bullshit. They FINALLY bring out my friend's grilled cheese (We were waiting for about an hour and a half since we ordered) how long does it even take to make a GRILLED CHEESE? Seriously??!!! So they have their food and I still don't have mine, and neither of us have our refills!!  As I was waiting for my food (still), my friend is dissatisfied with her pasta, so she, in all honesty, puts a hair in her pasta and tells the manager. Yes, we cheated them, but we waited two hours and got the shittiest service you can imagine. So she asks for soup instead of another entree. She gets her soup, but with NO SPOON. She was left eating the bacon bits with her knife, because they also didn't bring her another fork. Meanwhile I still don't have my fucking meatloaf. About 15 minutes passes by and the bring me a sub-par meatloaf. I only took two bites of my meatloaf when, upon further inspection, I find a ACUTUAL hair. It wasn't mine, because I have long hair; this was about half the size of mine. I was disgusted. Karma is a bitch. My friend complains to the manager about the crap service and the shitty food, to which he tells us that it's no excuse and offers us a free cheesecake slice and a happy birthday song. Honestly we felt so offended by that, it was basically a slap to the face. We did not want to spend another minute there, we had half the mind to leave. Just as we put on our coats, our waiter (who we only saw 3 times) comes by and tells us its on them. DAMN STRAIGHT IT'S ON THEM, I wasn't going to pay for any of that! We storm out of there, and as we are leaving, the manager tells us how this isn't their standards and blah, blah, blah, bullshit. But we just blew him off and ignored him.  It was seriously THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER. I was honestly waiting for someone to give me $100 for being on MTV's boiling points, it was THAT BAD. Not even kidding, I was looking for hidden cameras. It was surreal; how could a restaurant give service like THAT?! Especially for a restaurant downtown?! Especially for someone's birthday?! And the excuses they gave us? HA! Like I really believed them, they were so ridiculous. But for some reason, when we past the revolving doors to leave, we busted out laughing. It was just one big joke, and has since then become the butt of all our jokes.  And if we learned anything, it's that;  1. bring a spoon 2. never order the meatloaf 3. only go for the cheese cake, I guess.. 4. chain restaurants really are the devil (and are made for tourists) But hey, at least the food was free.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=600
Michael G.,"Newington, CT",88,29,1,5.0,2/9/2010,"All you haters giving this bad reviews are obviously those people that find something terrible in everything that is good. This place is top of the line and hopefully these five stars will boost it up. The food is absolutely delectable and ambiance is comforting. The free bread is very good and for an American cuisine place, I have absolutely no complaints.  Next up was the boneless buffalo tenders and let me tell you, I consider myself something of a wing connoisseur and these were some of the best I've ever had. A huge portion of chicken with a tangy sauce and blue cheese. Fantastic.  For dinner it was the shrimp scampi and it wasn't your typical dish, as the shrimp were on the side but the shrimp alone were awesome! The sauce that the angel hair pasta and shrimp lay in was a buttery-garlicy goodness that even being an Italian, really blew me away. But what we all came for was the cheesecake, which, quoting Ron Burgundy, ""is simply the best there is."" Millions of flavors for every kind of person and occasion. If you've never had it, you're not living. It's one of the seven wonders of the worlds - the pyramids and cheesecake. If you go just for cheesecake, you're getting your money's worth. I've eaten cheesecake there, never dinner until this time and I now qualify the cheesecake factory as one of my top dining areas. Little pricey, but if you're efficient with what you order and don't stuff yourself like I chose to, you'll be alright.

Marjorie F.,"Chicago, IL",240,280,6,2.0,1/25/2009,"Living in Chicago aka ""land of many options"", I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants.  The few times I've been here have been 1) for work (I used to work in the Hancock), 2) because an out-of-town visitor insisted on coming here, and 3) when a friend has a craving for their cheesecake. Last night a friend had a craving for their food.  This is something I just don't understand because of all the wonderful restaurants we have in this great city!  But anyway... We started out with the avocado eggrolls.  Strange, but tasty.  I ordered the meatloaf while my friend ordered a salad.  The portions are GI-NORMOUS!!!  Good grief...  I forgot about that!  No wonder we have an obesity epidemic in this country. The meatloaf was OK...  Not the best I've ever had.  When I saw the plate, I knew it was too much.  The portion was too big, sauce was overflowing on everything, and once I tasted it, there was too much salt.  We also ordered dessert - the tiramisu.  Holy whipped cream!  There was a small slice of tiramisu with FIVE huge dollops of whipped cream on top and on the sides.  Yuck...  Too much whipped cream.    Ummm...  Are you noticing a theme here? Yes, TOO MUCH. The service was friendly and fast, which was nice.  I'll give them that.  Our server even went the extra mile to get the tirimisu from the main kitchen since they didn't serve it in the cafe section (on the 1st floor) where we were sitting.  Bonus points to him! The decor is very much like Alice in Wonderland.  I recommend laying off the hallucinogenics before coming here. Parking in the area is terrible, so you have to pay a high fee to park in their garage.  It's something you can't avoid unless you have access to public transportation ( ). Overall, my experience here was OK.  Will go back?  Only if you make me.  In the meantime, I will continue my practice of avoiding chain restaurants as long as I live in this town!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=600
Deana L.,"Chicago, IL",73,80,7,3.0,1/1/2009,"I usually dislike chain restaurants, for high prices on packaged/canned food, however CF is a slight exception.  I didn't want to like it, at first but it has grown on me for its food choices and bread and butter refills.  And it's not that I have been to many Cheesecake Factory Restaurants; it's that I have eaten at 1 or 2 of the stores many, many times.  Tonight, I expanded my repertoire. The Chicago CF is on the bottom floor of the John Hancock building.  The color palette is the same as every other CF, but the décor is different.  There is a sexual vibe to it as my CF partner-in-crime/good friend said.  The women's bathroom is especially interesting with ornate door handles and beautiful doors.  Check out the ceiling too.  It looks like rows of dough rising.   The food is typical CF-fare with good-sized portions.  I had what seems to be a new addition to the menu: the vegetable chop salad.  I asked for the pomegranate vinaigrette dressing on the side so the salad was fresh and crisp with a lot of 'stuff': beets, tomatoes, cucumbers, edamame, apples, white cheddar.  I added the grilled chicken too.  The salad dressing on the side was a little strange; the salad is mixed with a pom glaze and then a honey-ish, sesame-ish dressing is added.  Since it's fairly involved, ordering it on the side was weird. Overall, the salad was yummy!  Sidenote: The wait for a table was long, but that is the same at any CF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=600
Aaron S.,"Chicago, IL",251,254,69,4.0,10/19/2008,"Despite the waits and the occasional slow service, I can't bring myself to give this place anything less than 4 stars.  This is probably because I'm not a gourmet - I'm a gourmand.  We prefer our food to be served ""en masse"" and never walk away from a table feeling anything but stuffed and satisfied.  Quality is something we can accept to let slide in exchange for guaranteed quantity, and luckily Cheesecake Factory serves up enough of both to make it worthwhile. I've only been there twice this year - mostly because when you get the benefit of decent quality with a good amount of quantity, it comes with the challenge of being annoyingly expensive. I don't think I've ever been to this place and had a bill less than $50 for two people dining. Once you've made it past the inane waiting process with a vibrating light-up coaster that will sit blankly in your lap for at least 30-40 minutes if you've come between the hours of 4pm and 9pm, you'll possibly make it to a table.  Of course, you could just end up at one of the annoying too-high-up tables at the bar because they're out of REAL tables and it'll pressure you into getting a drink while you wait an insane length of time for your waiter and/or food.  Don't fall for it - you can get a 750ml bottle of liquor for the price of one bar drink that contains maybe a shot or two of actual liquor in it.  And yes, some reviewers have it right that the bathrooms can get downright atrocious - though I must have visited once when it was freshly cleaned and once when it hadn't been cleaned in a while, because it runs the gamut between funky and fine. The bread is excellent.  Makes the wait for service and ordered food not that bad.  I admit that almost every time I'm here, I get the same thing.  The steak.  It's pricey, but it's one of the few things on the menu I'd never be able to find in a store and cook to the level of deliciousness that they manage to do.  The fries are okay, but the fried onions are delectable and pair so nicely with a good steak. And the cheesecake!  The Oreo is one of the ones I've had the pleasure of trying, but I have to personally give a shout-out to their 6-carb cheesecake, which was the perfect gift for my Atkins-dieting girlfriend's birthday surprise.  They even spelled Happy Birthday and her name in sugar-free chocolate. My girl returned the favor for the waitress's bonus decorations by letting her know that she felt sorry for the Cheesecake Factory's coffee machine, and that it sounded like they had a clog in the milk steamer or something, causing it to squeal annoyingly.  She thanked us for the tip and made sure to tell the staffer at the coffee machine. This place could make it to five stars if they lowered some of the prices, or reduced the menu enough so they could begin to truly excel at cooking a smaller array of dishes rather than churn out less-quality results from the nightmarishly-long menu.  I can't fault them for the long waits or the stressed-out servers, though.  If you go, and you're not a tourist, just punch any tourists you see in the stomach until word spreads that they're not tourist-friendly and then we Chicagoans can take back this awesome restaurant and get to enjoy the food without a 40-minute wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=600

My past two experiences with this place have signficantly increased my feelings towards their food. I once thought of this restaurant as pretty mediocre. The Thai Lettuce Wraps keeping me coming back. The three sauce combination is heavenly, the chicken is always smoky and tender and the butter lettuce cups are very refreshing. I would eat this great low carb dish all the time. More importantly, the past couple of times I've been extremely impressed with some of their other menu items that are pulling me away from my regular wrap order. The cashew chicken is served piping hot and has a delcious sweet and tangy sauce - really yummy! But once I tried my friends Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo order I was hooked. I stopped eating my own meal and just kept reaching across the table for more of his. Lucky for me, he liked the cashew chicken better and we switched. I'm obsessed with the gumbo and have searched long and hard for a copykat recipe. Perfection! Other appetizer options are tasty and worth mentioning, but they are too numerous to describe. You really can't go wrong. Beware of portion sizes on salads and entree items! Additionally, you should definitely get cheesecake! However, since you will be so full from your meal, I recommend doing what we did last time and ordering the cheesecake to arrive first. Take a few bites to tantalize your taste buds, and then set aside for after your main course. If you're still hungry, eat away, otherwise take it to go!

It was my birthday. My S.O. wanted to take me out for dinner and when He asked what I wanted, I told him steak. He had me flip a coin and though I had no idea what that meant at the time, My choice had led us here.  We got itnand had a long long wait. The booth however was pretty comfortable, and we were really in no rush so the wait didn't bother me. It was kinda fun to people watch and listen to the different crowd noises. I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory so I had no idea what to expect.  When we finally sat down at our table we were greeted by a really friendly waitress. All smiles, and as far as I could tell she was not faking her friendlyness which made it all the more nice. She made great conversation with through our meal, even listened when I told her that the milk steamer on their espresso machine was clogged. ( I had been a barista for a couple years at that point...they make a very loud distinctive noise when they are clogged and I know that noise when I hear it)  The menu was huge, which I think would make it a good place to bring a group to, because there is bound to be something for everyone on it. We each ordered our steaks. They came out at just the right temp and mine was perfectly medium rare. It was a really good steak! I was really surprised who knew that with a name like ""Cheesecake Factory"" they could make a good steak? (Glad my S.O. knew that though!)  During our meal my S.O. had wondered off, he said he wanted to see if they had his favorite kind of cheesecake, well when it was time for dessert I found out the real reason. He went off to tell our waitress that it was my Birthday, and convinced her and a different waitress to sink happy birthday to me. Here they come just after we finished our meal, carrying this plate that said ""Happy Birthday Char"" on the edges in chocolate syrup, and a big piece of cheesecake with a candle in it. After I blew it out, I was told it was the six carb cheesecake. How lovely! He had told them that I was on Atkins. (at the time anyway!)  I gotta say...It was really tasty!

I had been to this particular Cheesecake Factory before with positive results so I convinced him to go. Side Note: If you're shopping on Michigan Ave, this is a great place to wrap up your day.  When we checked in the hostess said their would be a 30 minute wait, so we tried the bar area and found a table top right away.  Service - Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. While we waited for food, a manager came over to apologize for the wait and I'm pretty sure was about to offer us a free appetizer, but we declined and just asked for more bread. What's funny about this is we didn't think at all the food was delayed. About 1/2 minutes later our food came out piping hot.  Food - The last few times I came here I order a delicious salmon dish (so good I figured out how to make it at home), bi this day I opted for the chicken enchiladas. Good Choice. It was a different taste than I was expecting from other times I've had enchiladas, but it was a good different. Very earthy and savory flavor. I finished every morsel. We also order cheesecake to go - and of course that was wonderful as well. Atmosphere - Set up like most Cheescake factories. A little dark here though, but once your eyes adjust, it's okay. It was a bit noisy in the bar area, so steer clear of there is you want quiet time.  So...the bathroom. Pretty clean, but it has complete stalls (toilet and sink) all together behind a door you can lock. So I and others had to wait a long time for a stall.

My mother ordered the Southern fried catfish, which was overcooked. My chicken maderia was prefect as usual, however the shrimp scampi was not freshly made. It was obviously prep and left to sit, the shrimp texture was soggy and room temperature.  I am really disappointed  in the lack of attention that went into the food and drinks.

And I am not a mojito person.  Sometimes the menu itself is overwhelming, but I usually like whatever I order. Clam chowder is always good. And the pastas are always good, too.

Liz K.,"Chicago, IL",6,270,219,2.0,3/1/2012,"Going to the Cheesecake Factory on a Tuesday night, I thought, finally I'll be here once when it isn't over an hour wait to sit down and I'll be able to enjoy my meal because it won't be so crowded! Well, we didn't wait for an hour, and it wasn't crowded. But we did have a group of 15 and apparently that waves a giant red flag for them to lower the quality of service. For a restaurant that consistently deals with a packed house on weekends, I was disillusioned to see that they couldn't keep up with our table on a practically empty Tuesday night. And it's not that our expectations were unreasonable, either; the things that I expected (greeting within 5 minutes, water glasses for everyone, drinks within 10-15 minutes, food to get to the right people) were completely within reason, in my opinion!  In terms of food, I was just underwhelmed with my dish. I got the Stuffed Chicken Tortilla, which comes with black beans, corn cakes, and sour cream. To me, that sounds like a Mexican/Hispanic dish, and I was looking forward to having some strong flavors come at me...but it was impressively bland. Not even more than a few shakes of salt could bring out an ounce of flavor. Really disappointing. I will give them one positive note, however, and it's that the cheesecake was wonderfully light yet rich. I got the Dulce de Leche variety and it was just fab. While I won't be back here to dine in, I would have no problem with dropping by to pick up a slice or two to enjoy at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=580

The taste was OK. Needed more croutons. The dressing was a little on the light side. Now to the cheesecake...ITS SO YUMMY!! I'm committing a sin just thinking about enjoying a slice of Oreo cheesecake with a side of vanilla ice cream...mmmm. The cheesecake is always good here and I've never been disappointed.

Alicia P.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,1.0,2/13/2013,"First off I'd like to say I do not use yelp and signed up just so I could explain to the public and the restaurant how awful this experience was! This was the worst dining experience I have had in a long time.  We went mid-afternoon to the Chicago cheesecake factory.  It was 4 friends and myself; the service was awful.  The male server serving us (I cant remember his name he had blonde longer cut hair, his name started with an F and it was a foreign name) was completely rude the entire meal and didn't even give us the time of day.  From the drinks to the bill I was disappointed.  We are in our mid to late 20s and locals.... We were out shopping for the day and ready to get some drinks and yummy food.... He sold us one drink each and when we drank them right away he came around took our dirty glasses, said nothing and walked away.  You would think a server would ask if we would like another drink.... Not only is that GOOD service but it would increase your bill as well??  He answered all of our questions rude and some questions couldn't even answer and said things like ""I don't know"".  Being a Chicago restaurant manager myself it took a lot to ignore this situation...  I tried hard.   However when our food all came out at different times, items were cold, the server was MIA for the entire time and the server never cleared anything besides the ONE drink order I was fed up.  I get very upset when I have a bad meal and even more upset when my friends are not enjoying their meal especially when we are PAYING CUSTOMERS!   I then decided I wanted to talk to a manager...  The manager was rude too!!  He said sorry however did nothing.  I told him ""If this was the restaurant I worked for this server would no longer have a job... I am not trying to get anyone fired but it's clear he has no respect for his job!""  The manager replied ""What can I do for you"" my reply was ""Nothing!"" and walked away.  The experience was already by far ruined!  And what type of management team member says ""what can i do for you?""  Your a manager sir and your job is to make sure your staff is doing a great job and giving customers the correct experience; if this fails then it is your job to embrace the customer, take in any problems and help assure the customer this was  fluke and would never happen again.  It is your job to make sure that the customer leaves happy and understands that the performance was unacceptable and engage in correcting rather than asking what the customer needs....  You know what we needed.  And you failed to do so.  There for you have now ruined a dining experience for your customers - one that actually could have been saved at that very moment.  Every place has bad staff members and its moments like this where a manager has the opportunity to a) correct and coach said employee of b) replace said employees with a staff member that wants their job and enjoys the service industry.   At the end of the day the food was sub-par since it was cold coming out at all different times, the server was the most awful - not only server but human I have ever interacted with and the manager should reconsider his life path.... Maybe consider a field where he actually isn't in charge of individuals and sits behind a desk and doesn't have to deal with customers.   I will add the only good experience was the bartender while we were waiting for our table.  It took him a long time to come over to us however once he did he was very pleasant and engaging....  Maybe they should consider moving him to management position or hiring more employees like that rather than Francisco or whatever his name was!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=580

She was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly and sociable. Everyone we came into contact with was very friendly also.  The food did not really impress me as i thought it would. we started out with the fried Mac-n-cheese. Which was good but really didn't wow me. For my main meal, I had The Romano crusted chicken with pasta. Once again, it was good but it just did not wow me. I was pleased with the portion size that I received. They did not cut corners on the portions.  Now it is time for the cheesecake. I was looking forward to the dessert because obviously, this place is known for the cheesecake.

Meow P.,"Munster, IN",68,84,4,2.0,7/23/2007,"This place is so nostalgic of dinners following high school dances, but you know what? I've never liked it. Not even the cheesecake. The food is average. It's pretty much the same exact stuff you could get at Houlihan's or any of your ""fancier"" Applebee's-type places. It's not bad, but nothing is ever very memorable and there isn't a single dish that I'd return again and again for. THAT's what I look for in a restaurant, and obviously The Cheesecake Factory doesn't have it. I really don't like heavy cheesecakes at all. I'm probably a bit of a cheesecake snob, but I much rather prefer the real deal. I like the light, fluffy Italian-style cheesecakes made with mascarpone and ricotta--the kind of cheesecakes you can actually savor throughout the process of eating a slice! Here, you have 6 pounds of cream cheese mixed with some sugar. I mean, obviously it doesn't taste bad, but it's just so gosh-darn rich that after one bite, your mouth goes numb and you lose all taste.  And for me, the worst part is, they always get me on these awesome-sounding cheesecake flavors, so of course, I have to get a slice. How could you pass up chocolate coconut or chocolate peanut butter cookie dough or even fresh banana? But then I try a bite or two and I'm sick of cheesecake for the next year-and-a-half.  I don't know. Maybe I just don't have enough estrogen flowing throughout my body to truly appreciate The Cheesecake Factory. I'll probably love it once I hit menopause.

Cheesecakes, an even more overpriced item, are alright; tiramisu was one of the least tasty once I've ever tried. I don't know what the big deal is about this place? Why the prices? To cover overhead for the rent, perhaps...that's the only excuse I can come up with. Btw has anyone else noticed that the ceiling of the restaurant at Michigan kind of looks like you are sitting inside of a fat person's colon? lmao. I think the servers are pretty good there so that's one plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=680

The chinese chicken salad is my favorite- just order it without the heaping pile of crispy foam wonton thingys. The pastas, sandwiches and other entrees are excellent and perfect for sharing. Even the cheese pizza is pretty tasty. The thai lettuce wraps make a great appetizer to share, also. They also have a great drink selection... and if you still have room in your stomach, you must order a slice of their signature cheesecake. Anything chocolatey gets a 2 thumbs up in my book.  (Not to hate, but I just found out that  one slice of the Outrageous Chocolate Cake has a whooping 1,380 calories!!!! DUH)  While some dishes are better than others, you can't go wrong here. Just be prepared to wait a while for a table on any given night of the week, or score a smaller table in the bar if you can.

C M.,"New York, NY",267,454,791,4.0,6/25/2009,"When an establishment names itself as the ""Cheesecake Factory"", all other edible offerings ranging from appetizers to entrees should be secondary (if not tertiary) to the Cheesecake.  Of course, having been rendered as the Cheesecake that trumps a certain Chicago staple (for which I will omit), a visitation to the highly renowned Cheesecake Factory must be partaken. The Decor:  Situated in the subterranean level of the John Hancock building, the cavernous modeling of the Cheesecake Factory provides a strange yet welcoming atmospheric feel.  At first entry, patrons will have the option of indoor or outdoor seating.  Immediate entry into the restaurant will reveal the delicious cheesecake offerings available for purchase.  Options ranging from the Classic Plain Cheesecake to Strawberry Shortcake are on full display for purchase either by slice or as a whole.  To further enter the establishment is to understand the cavernous nature and design of the establishment. As patrons further enter The Cheesecake Factory, the lighting of the establishment is engulfed by low lit tungsten fluorescent, thus enhancing the cavernous design of the walls.  Patrons may find the interior to possess a subtle claustrophobic and blinding feel.  What's also daunting, but slightly attractive (with respects to the design), is the echoing capacity of the facility.  Given the excess of 300 patrons that dine during any given second at this establishment, the echoing roar of sporadic conversation increases the decibels levels of the establishment. The Food: Entree - Energy Breakfast:  The ""Energy Breakfast"" consists of 3 Scrambled Egg Whites that's served with 3 oz. of Grilled Chicken Breast, Sliced Tomato, and Sauteed Mushroom &amp; Spinach.  At first glance, the first visually disturbing site, with respects to the execution of this dish, is the rendering of water from the cooked spinach.  The bottom of the plate was littered with the liquid excess.  This aided in the diluting of the simple seasoning used in the preparation of this application.  Upon consumption, the Egg Whites contained a supremely coarse texture, thus indicating overcooking.  The Chicken Breasts were excessively overcooked and under seasoned, with the texture of the chicken to be coarse.  The sliced tomatoes were the victims of the excess liquid flow as they become mushy and inedible.  The ultimate welcoming aspect of the dish was the sauteed spinach &amp; mushrooms.  Both were cooked perfectly and contained the earthiness found in both ingredients. The Dessert: Strawberry Cheesecake: At first reception, the excessive portion size of the Cheesecake spoke wonders to the receiving eye.  Patrons will notice that the 10 oz. to 12 oz. serving size of the Cheesecake will force any patron to seek a take out box.  Luckily, the excessive offerings produced a welcoming satiety to those seeking gluttonous punishment.  During visual inspection, the Cheesecake was observed to have the proper white color that's accompanied by an elegant soft texture.  The graham cracker crust, acting as the base of the foundation, contained a semi-firm texture.  Finally, the Fresh Strawberries and syrup produced an excellent color contrast to the application.  At first bite, patrons will find that the primary taste observed is from the light, velvety, and fluffy cheesecake.  During consumption, the creamy texture of the application engulfs the palate by releasing the notable cream cheese flavors.  Further tasting will reveal notes of vanilla, brown sugar, and butter, which enhance the creaminess of the cheese by providing a subtle sweetness.  All ingredients used in the creation of the cheesecake work harmoniously to create both an abundance of flavors while keeping the subtle soft texture of the cake.  To aid in the textural contrast, the semi-crunchy graham cracker crust provided the scrumptious texture and cinnamon flavors to further enhance the cheesecake.  Although the Strawberries provided the round about freshness and earthiness to the application, it acted secondary to the palate consuming flavors of the cheesecake. Perhaps perfection is observed through The Cheesecake Factory's rendition of Cheesecake.  By creating an edible that embodies the palate clasping flavors of the ingredients used while keeping the integrity and structure of the creaminess of the cheese, the application stands above the rest in both the complexity and tasting of this application.  Few remarkable words can be noted regarding the superb execution of the cheesecake, but the ones rendered should be emphasized for it's extraordinary flavors and execution. Notes on Cheesecake Factory: 1) Cheesecake = $6.00 to $7.00, but well worth it. 2) Avoid the long wait...  Simply get the Cheesecake to go. 3) Avoid the food!  A lot of my party felt the food was lack and the star is the Cheesecake. 4) Service was chaotic due to the increased customer to wait staff ratio. 5) Seriously...  Just go for the Cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=680

Lee C.,"Toronto, Canada",4,10,25,1.0,9/3/2012,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory in Buffalo and have had a pleasant experience each time.  On a trip to Chicago, I wasn't expecting anything less and sadly the experience was way below par. The floor was slippery from my table all the way to bathroom... the Blackhawks could have held a practice session on this floor. The restaurant was jam packed and obviously understaffed because the service was terrible.  The food was horribly timed as well.  Our table had ordered 3 fish tacos with 1 grilled and 2 tempura.  How could they serve 1 tempura while the other 2 didn't come out for a good 20 minutes?  At the very least, the 2 tempuras should be served at the same time.  That was the story for everybody else's dinners; nothing came out at the same time.  The tempura taco itself was completely overstuffed and the first taco itself was soggy (and an absolute mess to eat) as a result.  The last taco you eat will be the soggiest since it's been bathing in its own juices the entire time.  Simple requests like salad dressing on the side were completely ignored, as were requests for lime wedges that weren't bone dry. As for dessert?  Somehow they still managed to mess that up by serving the strawberry shortcake long after the rest of us received and finished eating our cheesecakes. Our waiter apologized for the service and said that the weekend before school starts in September is when they get slammed the hardest.  This is still no excuse for the restaurant if it were properly run.  Save your money and skip this location; it was a complete disgrace.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=700

When we asked when our food was coming, he said it hadn't been that long and that he would check. Instead he walks by and brings the manager. This is unacceptable at any restaurant. No one should ever have to wait 50 min for food that never came out. The server (Brian I think -bar area) should be fired. The food was terrible. The manager apologized and assured us he would make it right next time. Too bad, we will not be returning.

Erin C.,"New York, NY",42,203,6,3.0,11/2/2007,"The proliferation of Cheesecake Factory locations is making the country fat.  I mean, the portion sizes are out of control!  And the weight management salads are those UNDER 590 calories?  Really? That's not to say that the food isn't good, but it's just on the not so healthy side (which makes sense given the name of the restaurant).  Portions are more than generous; I ordered the lunch size pizza and side salad which was more like a personal size pizza and a full size salad.  I took half the pizza home and didn't finish the salad.  The good thing was that I was too full for dessert. The cheesecake IS delicious though, and I recommend trying it (splitting with someone else is probably the best option).  I love the pumpkin, tiramisu, and godiva cheesecakes.  And the chocolate raspberry truffle is heavenly.

We started with an appetizer of stuffed olives...which really should have been called deep fried sausage balls with a portion of olive somewhere in the middle...ick.   I asked our server for some recommendations for dinner my youngest daughter decided on the adult entree fish tacos so I split them with her...had the tortillas been cooked properly (they were soggy chewy) this would actually have been a really good meal (you had your choice of ahi tuna and mahi mahi and we went with the mahi mahi).  My husband got the meatloaf dinner and ate half (which means it wasn't good...usually he'll eat his meal and help one of us finish ours).  I didn't taste it so I can't comment on it.  My older daughter got the soup (mushroom....she is a soup lover and would usually like mushroom but she didn't really care for this one) and onion rings (which we sent back because the batter was not cooked all the way through).  Also somewhere in the middle of our meal we all of sudden had another server....no explanation why???    The cheesecake was the one hit of the meal and we did polish it off and discuss ordering another to take back to the hotel for later.  Bottom line....go somewhere else for dinner and definitely stop here for dessert!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=740

Tim J.,"Manteno, IL",16,210,72,1.0,1/8/2012,"We just got back from my wife's birthday dinner at the cheesecake factory in Chicago. We waited only moments to be seated on our reservation, but I watched 21 minutes tick by watching as tables all around us got seated with bread and water. When the table immediately to our right got their order taken and a moment later the table just beyond got their starter(both seated after us), I grabbed a waiter and asked to see a manager. We got an apology from a second manager and finally a waiter. After, starters arrived quickly. First the fried egg rolls with Guac, clearly fried in a hurry to get to us fast. Therefore very greasy and undercooked. After, the Thai lettuce wrap, which was the highlight of the evening. Although I imagine it is hard to screw up a raw appetizer plate. She had the orange chicken, a dish she had the previous day at the Cheesecake factory in Niles and said this portion was half of what it was in Niles. I had fettucini alfredo with chicken, which was incredibly dissapointing. It had about three oz chicken, the noodles were wide egg noodles and way way overcooked. They were just floppy. I ate about three oz of it and couldn't stand any more of it. Our seven year old had the chicken strips and refused to eat them, they were so over cooked. I tried them and she was right. They were as dry as cardboard....clearly pre-cooked. She ate none of them and only french fries. My wife stated the orange chicken was ok, but, ""not as good as Panda"". The cheesecake deserts were pretty good. My coffee was horrible and about on the level of dunkin donuts. Our bill came to $80.00 and we left a %12 tip. This was the worst money I have ever spent and I was highly disgusted with the food. I would not return to a cheesecake factory if cooporate contacted me and offered me a free equal meal. I plan to tell as many people I know what a terrible experience this was. Seriously, the orange chicken was not as good as panda?!?

They give you SO MUCH FOOD. They are pretty expensive but you can definitely take it home and eat just as much the next day. It's like two meals. My boyfriend got the personal pizza, which was essentially a medium sized full round pizza you would get at a pizza place. They give you a lot of food. The cheesecake is very good also.

Janet N.,"Chicago, IL",4,17,,4.0,10/14/2006,"Come for the cheesecake, stay for the food. Really. If you love cheesecake that's probably the reason you're going to go. But you simply can't ignore the food. Set aside a few bucks and skip lunch, because you're gonna want to eat a LOT. Even the meatloaf is spectacular. If you can, end your day there so you can get a doggie bag and your cheesecake to go, because they really do give you that much food. Just be careful not to go for too many additonal sugary elements to the cheesecake--some of them will practically rot your teeth off instantaneously they're so sweet! Here's what I don't like about this location--it's always so terribly packed and when it's not the best weather you can't just wait outside for your buzzer to go off. Not to mention once it does you have to go inside and wait again. Plus, if you have a stroller or wheelchair you have to go around to another entrance and may well get lost trying to get to the place. Having to search for the elevator in the main building and walk through the hallways to the back door made me feel a little second-class, just because my friends had a stroller with them.  But there is a reason it's so packed, and there's a reason that I will take my friends there. If it were only about the cheesecake, the line would be longer for the bakery counter than the seating.

Harley W.,"Woodland Hills, CA",60,12,4,1.0,11/18/2010,"I was in Chicago as part of a road trip with my brother and two sisters. Which means we were having a great time having all the time in the world to be together, but we were also on a schedule to see all the things we wanted before us sisters had to go back on the road and my brother had to catch a plane back home, back to work. We had plans to see a show together on our last night in town and made the mistake of stopping at the Cheesecake to eat before the show. First, we were informed that my brother's order was somehow stolen from the kitchen. That's the first time it ever happened to us in all the years of eating out, but we were kinda amused, and decided we can still make it to the show, so we waited some more.  My brother got his order and said it wasn't amazing, but it tasted ok, but me and my sisters had to send our Pasta Da Vinci back to the kitchen twice for being undercooked. It was really doughy. We felt bad for doing that. We're usually not the kind of people who complain. It makes us feel uncomfortable. But even the poor waitress (who we felt bad for, I know what it's like to work in the service industry and apologize to clients about problems you yourself did not create. We were happy to leave a tip for her when we left) had to relay an apology from the cooks who agreed  the dish was below standards. We decided to get a plate of fries so we can leave and go to our show already. We ended up paying way too much for my brother's dish, the fries and our drinks, and left the place hungry, after a long  long wait, with no time to make it to the show. Complete disappointment. More than anything, I was angry that I entrusted this place with my last evening it town with my family, and that I kept waiting, hoping they will get their act together.

Moni K.,"Evanston, IL",195,508,118,2.0,10/2/2008,"I am going to be very honest about my recent experience here: I had a glass of wine CHIANTI - RUFFINO, Italy ,TEX MEX EGGROLLS, and THE INCREDIBLE GRILLED EGGPLANT SANDWICH I waited 30 minutes for my wine, and I know that the wine that I got was not a chianti from Italy (My husband also ordered a beer and he waited for it patiently for 30 minutes too) Tex mex eggrolls were very good THE INCREDIBLE GRILLED EGGPLANT SANDWICH was ok...But the sad thing is that  I asked for ketchup  for my fries and I NEVER got it. So here is the service story: When we finally got our drinks 30 minutes later, we ordered our meal, my husband ordered a clam chowder soup. Our waiter said I will bring it right out...he never did took another 30 minutes and brought everything all at once. For his excuse he said the soup is made from scratch... my ass from scratch...you were not making it from scratch right now...it was prepared in the morning and all you have to do is heat it up, but you forgot. The sad part is that our waiter was not busy he had 4 open tables. Not only that he kept on patting my back whenever he came by, took requests and never came back with them. Pretty much he tried to bullshit his way of being of any help.  The patting on the back was just plain inappropriate and insulting. He was so obnoxious when he came by that another couple next to us started staring at him whenever he approached our table. The waiter also ignored my father in law's calls after him to remind him of the forgotten stuff. NOW, when the bill came, the waiter came by kneeled by our table and said that he knows his service was bad but the restaurant is understaffed. I am sorry but how can you be understaffed when you have 4 tables open, next to us. You see my dear father in law is a good soul (he also did not visit the bathroom)  tiped this man as usual but oh dear this was an experience Let me mentioned the BATHROOMS Filthy and dirty While I used the toilet I had to stand  in pee that was on the floor. Now tell me how a company like the Cheesecake Factory if they know they are so busy  and always understaffed why not take care of the bathrooms.

Tara M.,"Chicago, IL",124,243,2,3.0,10/20/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is what it is: an overpriced chain restaurant with the most ridiculous menu I've ever seen. But everything on it is pretty solid and the service has always been acceptable. For the purposes of my review, I want to note two recent experiences here, both of which started with crappy service that was ultimately remedied. 1.) My mom and I went to CF for lunch one day a couple of months back. Within 2.5 seconds of her greeting us, I noticed that our waitress' nails were filthy. I mean FILTHY. I couldn't take my eyes off of them and lost my appetite on the spot. I didn't say anything to my mom about it so as not to ruin her meal, but a few minutes later she made a comment to me about it. So we ordered our respective entrees and the fried mac & cheese appetizer, the whole time praying that our waitress didn't touch any of our food. Our appetizer came out cold and apparently that was the last straw for Mom. She asked for the manager and complained mostly about our waitress' nails, and just a little about the cold appetizer. The manager offered to comp our appetizer and apologized profusely for the waitress--I really hope that the poor girl didn't lose her job. But hopefully CF checks their staff now before sending them out on the floor! 2.) My parents came down to the city last week and, as usual, wanted to hit up CF. Everything was going fine--our waiter (Scott) was friendly and attentive. We ordered promptly (Dad had the crispy beef, Mom ordered some sort of pasta and I ordered fish tacos). My dad's and my food came out just fine, and my poor mom sat there and waited and waited...finally the manager came out and explained that her pasta had gone to another table but that she would have it shortly. So about 20 minutes after my dad and I got our food, my mom got hers. Not really a big deal and we all dug in. My fish tacos suuuucked, by the way. Anyway, our waiter came back later to apologize again and my dad joked that my mom should get a free dessert for having to wait. Totally kidding. But a few moments later my mom was told she could choose any dessert she'd like. Thanks, guys! Overall, CF has good food (I will never stray from the Bistro Shrimp Pasta again) and I am sure that due to the sheer size of the restaurant and the menu that mishaps are bound to happen.

The calamari is cooked to perfection, but if you want to try something new order the avocado egg rolls. Crispy, fried on the outside and warm avocado filling on the inside. Perfect way to start off our meal. For my entree I ordered the Chicken Madeira, which is their most popular chicken dish, and definitely exceeded my expectations. Unfortunately I could not finish the whole meal, but if you love mushrooms, asparagus, cheese and chicken in an extremely yummy sauce, you should get that dish.

Just outside was a large Christmas tree, which they erect yearly, it was magical. We went inside and there was barely room to walk. It was immensely loud and everyone was overbearing. We received a buzzer and ended up waiting about two hours. It was worth the wait, when we were seated, it was in a large booth to accomidate our large party. The menu is quite diverse and I had a very hard time deciding. Our food was timely and was quite delicious. Dessert was outstanding, they have a slew of different cheesecakes and much more.

I when to college where there was a cheesecake and ate there once every few months and love love love the bistro shrimp pasta. I moved to Chicago last year and this was my first experience at this location - and even though it is super touristy (don't hate it for that - most people do not have this restaurant in their town and the menu is more that big enough to accommodate even the pickiest eater) it was an overall good experience. My drink, a raspberry martini, was $10.50 and not very strong, so I wouldn't suggest it. We ordered three small plates from the bar menu (prices range from $2.95 to $4.95) lettuce wraps, pulled pork sliders and fried calamari. The pork was not pulled, just chucks, but good bun and sauce, but the pork itself really needed some work and some fat trimmed. The lettuce wraps (3) were good, fresh vegetables but the calamari was by far the best. I highly recommend that dish. Our service was great and the food was cheap and good - we thought we found a close place a get some food deals and drinks but the drinks were too weak for the price - probably would go back, but we are not running there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=800

The cobb salad is absolutely delicious and instead of the fattening ranch dressing that a cobb is normally doused in, the Cheesecake Factory cobb was dressed with a light, tangy vinaigrette. I would also recommend the eggplant sandwich. The sandwich was perfectly savory and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. If you are watching your weight, consider substituting the fries for a baked potato, fruit, or vegetables. Last, but certainly not least, the 6-carb cheesecake. While it does not sound appealing to those not watching their weight, it's actually delicious. It's lighter and fluffier than normal cheese cake and has a walnut crust which is actually a better compliment to cheese cake than graham cracker.

When we got to the table we noticed the silverware was DISGUSTING. There was traces of food on each and every single one of the utensils. Fortunately we were sitting near a window so we were able to see the appalling state of the silverware. Most of the restaurant was dim so I doubt others would have been able to notice the leftover food on their forks and knives before sticking them in their food and mouths. After having our utensils replaced TWICE we got our beverages, which also left something to be desired. After taking a few sips of my water, I found a long black strand of hair in my water.  Don't get me wrong; I am not a fussy, demanding customer but this was just too much. I asked another waitress to replace my drink and she got the manager. The manager apologized a dozen times before leaving us alone and then kept coming back to our table to check back on us, which became rather annoying. The food was alright, nothing particularly amazing . We asked our waiter for the check and offered us a slice of cheesecake on the house for all our troubles. I don't understand why the entrée portions were so big and yet we got this tiny morsel of cheesecake. We decided to get the brownie sundae cheesecake and we took it home. For a restaurant that calls itself ""The Cheesecake Factory"" I was expecting the best cheesecake I've had in my life. It was extremely decadent, in an inedible-without-a-glass-of-milk kind of way.

Even though I'll be staying within a block of this place for the next few weeks, I would only come back if I have a cheesecake craving, and even then, I would order take-out.  I'm writing this review to vent partly, but seriously, I enjoy dining out and spend good money on it, so places should not be allowed to treat people this way for no good reason.  I hope others will find this helpful and either call these waiters out or demand their bread and straws!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=760
Dillon C.,"Chicago, IL",3,2,,2.0,1/8/2010,"Writing a review for this place is kind of like writing a review for a $6 hotdog at a ballpark: If you like the overall experience, you'll probably like the food and it'll be worth it.  If you're just after a good dog though, you might be better served looking elsewhere.  The Cheesecake Factory is right on Michigan Ave; big-time downtown Chicago location.  And not only is it there, it belongs there.  Anyways, it took a year of convincing for me to believe this place served more than cheesecake.  It also took more than a year to go through the diner menu once I got there: it's huge. First, we got a couple of drinks that were 10 bucks apiece.  It was fun to be indulgent but what came out really wasn't that great (or strong).  Next, we ordered the lettuce wraps (bib lettuce, grilled chicken, carrots, noodles, cucumbers, bean sprouts, ECT) from the app menu.  They were my favorite part of the meal (really, just one of the three 1oz dipping sauces was my favorite part of the meal).  For my entrée, I got a combination of shrimp scampi and ""Steak Diane,"" which was peppercorn encrusted steak w/ mushrooms.  My GF got a pizza.  Both entrees were unimpressive and left me thinking about what I'd do to change them.  Regrettably, I don't really like cheesecake too much.  I tried (and shyly liked) both of our cheesecake deserts.  I hear from LOTS of people the have ""the best"" but I'm not one to say either way.   I'm not an ""anti-chain"" person but, somehow, this place falls into the negative mold.  There's just something about the taste of the food... kind of a salty, unsatisfying background that's always there.  Still, the food certainly isn't as bad as a Bennigan's or something like that so it didn't send me away screaming.  The service was fine.  What was painful were the prices.  Way, way too much for the value of food.  And that's the bottom line. I really like going down to Michigan Ave. in the heart of downtown Chicago.  I love the bustle and perpetual motion of it all.  The Cheesecake Factory is a fun, indulgent spot that belongs right there in the mix.  If you have guests coming in from out of town who want to experience Chicago by shopping downtown, peering out of tall skyscrapers, and eating somewhere fun afterwards, I think that they would really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.  But the fact is that, somewhere else, you could be getting better food for  1/2 the price and incredible food for the same price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=760

I don't generally love cheesecake and it would never be my first pick for a dessert.  But the things they do to it here make it so good! Split the dutch apple with my sister and sort of wished I had just ordered a piece as my lunch.  I would say don't bother with the food here and just come for dessert!  2) The food is also good enough and reasonably priced for how much you get.  I ordered the lunch size of the thai something or other pasta (which was good but really reminded me of the taste of a lean cuisine I like, which made me think I would have been better off having the lean cuisine for lunch!).  It was still ENORMOUS after downsizing- I can't imagine what kind of monstrosity they bring you for a dinner portion! I ate maybe 1/2 at most.   3) Huge menu should mean that there is something for everyone, so its a good place to take picky eaters you can't take somewhere better 4) The outdoor seating.  Its nice in the summer as a break from shopping.  Granted the line is huge then, but you can sit out on the steps and wait and its not a huge deal.  Cons:  1) Seriously- downsize the portions a bit more! There is a reason this country is morbidly overweight and this has to be part of it!  2) the decor.  There's something ALMOST cool about it, but it also reminds me of intestines and is overall way over the top and tacky.  I don't want to be thinking about the digestive system as I eat.  Its just too much.  Also the floors are very very slippery.  My heels almost couldn't take it, I nearly wiped out (and it wasn't because of the rain) 3) The huge menu.  While in some ways a pro, I find it to be a con as well.  To me it means they just can't figure out what they do well so I'm not sure what to get- do I get something Asian? Italian? A sandwich? It seems like they do all of these things well, but not great.  But I guess there's nothing really wrong with ""good.""  This place is bad for the indecisive, as well as the arteries. Go for lunch rather than dinner I think- we got there before noon so didn't have to wait a long time. I wouldn't wait an hour for this- I agree with those who say its probably best to save this place for a take out dessert!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=760

Now I understand that this place is in the mag mile so is overloaded with tourists. This would be fine except there are often many open tables and the college kid waiters are just immune to noticing. Zero sense of emergency!! In addition to that the food is just OK. Nothing special. It's definately aimed at the unadventurous bland american palette. There is just something so generic about it. The cheesecake for which it is named isn't that great either. Again it tasted mass produced and artificial. The only saving grace is the martini menu which are actually quite good - although pricey.

J D.,"Chicago, IL",82,291,12,3.0,11/3/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is, well, it's The Cheesecake Factory. The food is reliably okay, anywhere in the country. I do, however, love their new small plates menu. Thus our epic begins. The first time I visited this location, they didn't even give us a copy of the small plates menu. They just gave us the regular one. Since we were all tired and hungry, this led to a lot of whining and being pissy because we thought we'd come out for no reason. The server didn't do anything to remedy that, either. After finally settling on some regular food to order, we were told that the artichokes in the kitchen were no good and so I would have to order something else. Shouldn't the servers be told that before the dinner rush? Anyway, my food finally came and it wasn't great but it was passable. My companion spilled her drink and a manager who came to check on us told her he'd be right back to clean it up for us but never returned so she sat with a lap and table full of ice water for her whole meal. At the end of the meal we spoke to another manager who then discounted the enter meal save for the cost of drinks and we were pretty much satisfied with the kind and professional way he handled the situation.  Last week we returned and 'lo and behold, the small plates menu had been added to the main menu, avoiding any future confusion. Thank you, Cheesecake Factory! We ordered our meal and in the process of bringing things out, our server dropped both of my roommates' items. The food, when it came out, was tasty and I enjoyed it all (stuffed mushrooms, beet salad, garlic knots, a perfect assortment). Then the server got kind of creepy and starting trying to talk to us about the death of John Coltrane and asking my barely 20 year old roommate about her interests (he was closer to late 30s/early 40s) in a way that made us uncomfortable. So, I guess it's up in the air. Food can be awesome or terrible, service can rock or blow. Who knows?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chicago?start=820
Melissa M.,"Chicago, IL",89,334,1,4.0,12/7/2008,"Wow, I can't believe I haven't written about the Cheesecake Factory yet. This has been my unofficial favorite restaurant for probably fifteen years now, if not more. I remember when it first opened in the Hancock building, I was in maybe second or third grade and I read about it in the Chicago Tribune Kids section, KidNews. And I begged and begged my parents to take me. And ever since then, I have loved it. This Hancock location is definitely my favorite but I have eaten in Cheesecake Factory's all over the country - seriously, any time I go on vacation, I always end up there because I love it so much. I almost always get the Chinese Chicken Salad - oh so good. Their burgers are also delicious, as is the pizza. The last few times I have gone I have gotten this Meditteranean mahi mahi special that is just delightful. The strawberry martini - heaven. And of course the cheesecake. My usual is white chocolate raspberry but I had key lime last time and it was also wonderful. Everything can REALLY add up though - I try not to go there too often. I always end up splitting an app, plus an entree, plus a cocktail (or 2), plus my cheesecake and coffee.... you can pretty easily spend $60+ just for yourself! I have heard complaints about bad service and stuff but overall I just feel that people have crazy high expectations of servers. I have thought this even before I WAS a server but being a server solidified my feelings.
