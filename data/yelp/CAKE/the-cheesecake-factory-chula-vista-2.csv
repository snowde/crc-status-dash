Laura B.,"San Diego, CA",136,63,211,4.0,8/16/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has a very good selection of food items on the menu. I like the variety of appetizers, salads, pastas, Mexican, Asian, and American foods. Lots of choices! There's also a kids menu too with food items the little ones are sure to like. I chose Mexican on my most recent visit. The beans, rice, chicken, tortillas, green salsa and avocados were fresh and delicious. My daughter ordered Chicken Marsala, and my son ordered Shepard's Pie. They were also pleased with the quality. Our appetizers included fried macaroni and cheese balls. They literally melt in your mouth. Delicious! I like that they start your meal with complimentary warm bread and butter too. My favorite is the darker bread, that has oatmeal sprinkled over the top. It's a little on the sweet side, which satisfies my sweet tooth. The best part is the excellent cheesecake choices! We purchased a whole carrot cheesecake to eat at home. I got the 10 inch and was surprised when I found out how much it cost, which was about $52.00. Yikes! Next time I'll ask the price before ordering. It was so big, that the 7 inch would've been just fine. Regardless, it was very good.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the noise level. It's hard to have a conversation. It's pretty loud inside of the restaurant. Other than that, it's a nice place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=60
Madel C.,"San Diego, CA",69,1,1,1.0,4/8/2017,"Basically went to this location during lunch time and got fish and chips. Didn't finish my food so I asked to take it to go. Server didn't give me a bag the first time I asked and kind of gave me an attitude when I asked the second time. Then the server took my plate to box it to go while I paid for my meal... WITH TIP... because this is America. Went home and around dinner time I decided to eat my fish and chips. HOWEVER.... when I opened my to go box, it was BREAD!! Like c'mon really!! Do I really have to double check my to go box meal before going home! And let me remind you again... it was lunch time! It was less hectic for this horrible server to make such careless mistake.

Ronald R.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,16,5,2.0,9/27/2017,"We come here occasionally when looking to eat a hearty meal. We've come to expect the long wait to get seated and the long wait to get our food (more than 20 minutes).  Today upon arriving, we got seated in less than 10 minutes. But getting our food took a lot longer than usual. Why, because our server forgot to place our order! We ordered appetizers with our meal almost immediate after getting seated. After waiting a while, we asked our server how much longer before we get the appetizers. She went to check with the kitchen, and came back to tell us that she forgot to order out appetizers. She then asked if we still want our appetizers because our food is almost ready. So I told her to forget. Our food took another 20 minutes to be served. So, I came to the conclusion that she forgot to place our order altogether. Because how can she forget the appetizers but not the meal when she wrote them on the SAME TICKET???  I can tolerate incompetence, but not getting lied to.  If not for their awesome always-fresh brown bread, I will never come back to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=60

Avocado egg rolls and crispy crab wontons were excellent.  I tried the Thai Salmon lunch portion for $14.99 which was a great value.  My favorite is miso salmon though.  Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake lived up to its name.  It was outrageously good!  The new Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch cheesecake was good too.  My all time favorite is still White Macadamia Cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=60
Jayme D.,"Spring Valley, CA",247,20,8,4.0,4/19/2017,"My family comes to Cheesecake Factory when we can't decide where else to eat because the menu offers a wide range of food choices for each one of us. It's a sit-down place right by Barnes and Noble. You park in the mall parking lot and, if you're just walking in and depending on the time of day, can meet a wait time of anywhere from fifteen minutes to over an hour. The attire is pretty flexible; you can come dressy for an event or casual for lunch. The restaurant also accommodates group parties, although usually in a group event we've been seated outside. The food is usually somewhere between $12-$30 depending on what you order, and the wait staff are always really nice. Portions are generous. You get free bread and butter to tie you over before your entree comes out, and it's always a warm and welcome addition to your meal. The food itself can be a hit or miss because of the broad range of dishes they offer. I really like their salmon, broccoli and mashed potatoes dish, so if you're into fish I suggest you give it a try. For an appetizer, definitely try the tex mex eggrolls. As for seating, you can either sit at a booth/table inside or a table outside. The noise level is average (conversations around but not to the point that you can't hear yourself speak) and the seating is pretty intimate; the booths have high backs so you're pretty much in your own space. The cheesecake is also really good. If you're a chocolate lover, I suggest the Godiva cheesecake; it's rich and comes with a little Godiva square on top.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=60

The crew and service are magnificent; however, the food quality to my liking has changed. The Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls had way too much rice noodles, and I could never find the shrimp. I will not be ordering them again. The Jambalaya entree that I ordered and am very familiar with did not have the same consistency as before, and when I as ked the server for spicy, when it arrived at my table I had to beg for water. Besides those issues, I would recommend this family restaurant to anyone, the happy hour from 4 to 6.00 pm is very doable!

Eddie A.,"San Diego, CA",28,17,,3.0,1/8/2017,"As any Cheesecake Factory this place gets really packed especially on the wknds. Although there's a lot of parking areas, you will find that it is hard to find one nearby. (suggestion -  park by the library and just walk) Wait time average 30min to an hour (personal experience) Cleanliness - silverware sometimes have residues from poor washing, and the floor seems to be slippery. Food - Steaks are great!!! but hibachi steak is too sweet. Thai wraps are bomb. If you're going to order cheesecake ensure that it's freshly made (baked) The one they gave us tasted like a week old Service - expect to wait after you sat down. Your waitress might be too tired to provide the proper service (after taking your drinks and appetizer order about 10-15min wait). After taking your order (main entre) 10-25min wait for main food to arrive (always forget steak knife). Then, your waitress will disappear 'til you're almost finish with your meal so if you're looking for any assistance,... you have to ask someone else.  Overall - the food is the only thing that this place offers!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=60
Ros A.,"University City, San Diego, CA",540,269,761,3.0,8/21/2015,"I do like the food at Cheesecake Factory. Service and wait times aren't that great. Came on a weekday evening with a party of 12.  Service: - Our server seemed nice, but since he had our table plus several other tables he would often forget things. There were a few things we had to ask for 2-3 times. And during the wait in between appetizer and dinner, he didn't check on us.  Waiting: - Once we ordered our entrees, it took over 40 mins for our food to come. Some restaurants give kids their food ahead of time, but not at Cheesecake. - My aunt doesn't like spicy food. She had ordered the fish tacos and asked if the salsa/sauce was spicy. The server said no. When her food came out, for her it was spicy. So we asked them to re-make it since the sauce/salsa was on all the tacos. Her food took about 10 mins to re-make. Some were already done eating. In my opionion, the server should have put it on the side just in case.  Food: - To start off, we had the calamari. These had a good crisp and was served with two different sauces.  -I ordered the Chicken Picatta. It had been years since the last time I had piccata. The chicken was moist and had the right amount if sauce. The portion was a good amount, so I had enough for lunch the following day. - I tried the Classic Burger. This too was good.  Overall I would give 3.5 stars.  If the service was better, the food would make up for the long wait times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=60

The spinach tasted a teeny bit soggy, and the whole dip overall was pretty flavorless. I had to pile on the salt.

My all time favorite Pasta Da Vinci... They make it either too sweet or too bland... Today it was too sweet... The mix of wine and parsley and other ingredients just didn't set in well together.

But when you take that long drive down the Toll 125 fwy and Chick Fil-A across the street won't cut it, you have to keep this place in mind.  After you park your weather beaten SUV and take that long stroll to the neon sign, you are instantly greeted by a fresh faced college co-ed who promptly seats you among the dozens of leather booths and wicker chairs.  The dimly lit ambience arouses your senses, the flashes from the large LCD monitors above the bar attract your attention, the all-white dressed servers impress you with their fast paced efficiency that is accompanied  by a never ending smile.  I've been a fan of this restaurant chain since 1993. I've always ordered the Chicken Jambalaya Pasta. The quality has wavered from location to location but I'd say it plays well here. The dishes are always filling and you'll be tempted to conclude your meal with a slice of their award winning cheesecakes.

I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and the linguine was not cooked. Normally I don't send my food back but this time I had to unfortunately do so. The waitress (who was very sweet and polite) returned to the table to tell me that the chef said,"" that is how the pasta is prepared."" I let the waitress know that this is a dish I have always ordered and I know what uncooked pasta taste like. She went back to the kitchen, and after talking to the chef came back to let me know that it'll be about 10 minutes. When I got my Cajun jambalaya I notice there was a lot of water in the bottom of the plate, the shrimp was over cooked to a rubbery texture. It tasted watered down. He may have just added water and reheated it in the microwaved. I have worked in a restaurant myself and I will say that if the customer doesn't like something you do everything you can to make the customer happy. The Chef seems like he doesn't like criticism.

First, I tried the Crispy Crab Cakes with Mustard Sauce which was D- wait for it... licious! It's nice, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside of the crab, and putting it on the mustard sauce was a nice touch! Oh, and I also tried the fried cheese triangles, which were pretty good too. Next, I got the Fresh Basil, Tomato, and Cheese Flat-bread Pizza which was so good. It has a nice, thin, crispy crust of the flat-bread, and the fresh basil, juicy tomatoes and gooey cheese, just marvelous! and I also tried a bit of mom's Shrimp Scampi, or whatchamcallit? But, is still pretty adequate. And Finally, here it comes... CHEESECAKE!!! Eeyup, My Favorite Part! I got a piece of the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, and it is ""Hands Down"" and ""I'm in Heaven"" GOODNESS! It's always Moist, Indulgent, Creamy, Sweet, and best of all, YUMMYTASTIC!

After taking our pager our party of 9 was left standing at the front. Some blonde lady in pink, didn't say who she was or if she was a shift lead or manager or whatever told us that they were ""just checking in"" with us and that there was no way to know how long it would take for the people at the table to get up and leave. She said it would be rude of her to tell those patrons to leave but then in the same breath told me that my toddler could be fussy and would probably be better off waiting at Barnes at Noble until the table was ready. Do the pagers even extend that far? I think they did tell the patrons to leave though because a huge party walked out and none of them looked happy at all.  We were hungry and we're ready to put in our main order with the appetizer but our server insisted that he would take that order later. While waiting for our mains to come my mom finds a huge fly sitting in the bottom of her sweet tea! They brought us a new tea and that same blonde in pink came over and asked us how we were doing, didn't apologize or acknowledge the fly or anything!!! We asked the waiter if he had told his manager and he said he did but she didn't say a word about it.  Also my fiancé ordered a medium rare burger and they served him medium well. This has happened every time we come here and I don't see the point in asking customers if they're just going to cook it however they want.  They didn't comp anything or apologize at all when clearly they were at fault for a lot of problems. Also when I went to the bathroom the hostess checked the stalls but didn't wipe down the counters which was sucked because I needed to get my toddler on the counter to wash his hands.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=20

But, due to a severe lack of really good, locally owned, restaurants in this area of Chula Vista, the hubs and I have stopped in a few times on movie nights. I can't speak on other Cheesecake Factory locations, because I've never been to any others, but this place isn't half bad. The menu is massive, so prepare for a bit of a read. The portions are ridiculously large so prepare to take leftovers home or just leave quite a bit of food on your plate at the end of a meal. Given the menu and portion size, my meals have - so far - been well prepared and seemed fresh compared to other chains. The beer selection is small, so if you're looking for craft brews to choose from, you're out of luck. Despite the place seemingly always has a line, we've never had to wait long.

The menu is too big.  If you live in the area of this specific place, you know it's always packed at certain hours. If you still go and you're making the ""I just farted, but I don't want to make a noise smell"" face - that's your fault.  Plan ahead! The free bread is always a plus and the servers are always super nice!   The cheesecake selection is ridiculous, but dope! Their Oreo Cookie shake is my favorite!  It's pretty much the only rival to Jack In The Box.  Jack In The Box is cheaper though.   Beer selection could be better but it's not a bar so it's okay.   The only thing I never understood is why are the uniforms White???   Seems like the company should be adding a detergent expense to their employees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=20

We were quoted a 25 min wait and given a pager. We requested outdoor seating since if it was available first and noticed no one was being seated outdoors anymore. I had my teenage daughter go to check in and let the staff know we'll take any available seat. My daughter comes back to tell my husband that they had paged us and called out name. That was a flat out lie. My husband was livid and said the pager didn't go off. We were also sitting outside and our names weren't called either. I went back inside to tell the staff what my daughter told us and they said we'd be seated right away. After 5 min of waiting we were finally seated. When it was my turn to place my order, the server mentioned that they didn't have that dish available. She hands me a paper that listed the unavailable dishes... I swear there was about 20 of them! I told the server to take my husband and daughter's order and to come back for mine. When she comes back, I choose another dish. That was also unavailable too. I was starting to get frustrated. She just explained that the restaurant underestimated how busy it was.  If a restaurant knows IN ADVANCE that more than 10 dishes are unavailable, this should be announced at the time of checking in. Customers should know in advance the menu is limited, especially for the popular items.  If that were the case, my family would've left at eaten elsewhere. My husband wanted to get up and leave, but we already waited 30 minutes and were seated. Not very happy with tonight's dining experience.

Our waitress was very polite and attentive. If your bringing your significant other the lighting really sets the mood haha  I got the Mac n Cheese balls and jambalaya pasta. It was super delicious. The Mac n Cheese balls had the right amount of crisp. The jambalaya pasta was pretty darn good. I was kind of curious how they would pull that off but it had a nice kick to it.

Desserts: Skip. The last time we had room for dessert and got the red velvet and 30th anniversary cheesecakes. I wasn't impressed. The cheesecake was in between slices of cakes (red velvet and chocolate respectively), but the cheesecake part was too whipped and even too salty for me and may have resulted in less cheesecake flavor.

Shanel S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",704,827,917,5.0,6/18/2014,"Yes, this is your typical Cheesecake Factory. One that makes mistakes, and can sometimes bring your food out cold. However, their service is superior to all the other Cheesecake Factory's I have been to. We came here on Father's Day with a party of five. It seemed fairly busy, but we were seated at the time that was quoted. That's always a plus! After being seated we were waited on by Davon H. He was outstanding! He brought all of our drinks promptly, and even brought out all of my annoying requests quickly. They were out of sourdough bread at the time we arrived, so he kept following up and remembered to actually bring it after it was freshly baked. That almost never happens at a Cheesecake Factory. I ordered my usual Tomato Basil Pasta and loved it of course. My friend got the Fish and Chips and unfortunately the portion was skimpy and very cold. They tasted like they were sitting under the heat lamp for too long. I'm not sure how Davon took notice that he wasn't satisfied, but he quicky came over to ask what he thought. When he saw that my friend wasn't happy, he offered to replace the meal with no hesitation, brought his manager to recover the situation and even offered a soup or salad while he waited for his meal to come out. The new portion was much better...and actually hot. My other friend got the Chicken Bellagio and loved it! Their fettucine was just ok, and their Ribeye meal had no complaints all around. For dessert I splurged and got a slice of Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple. It was stuffed with fudge, PB, and even Butterfinger goodness. The slice was skimpy like most Cheesecake locations and there was a large portion of the cheesecake that didn't have any filling which kind of sucked.

A co-worker and I always used to get the Luau salad. It was always delicious, until it wasn't. Can't pinpoint exactly what's different. Our guess is there's less of the good greens and more iceberg. Plus they don't glaze the wonton skins anymore. Then on the light menu, the balsamic chicken with farro used to come with at least 2T of farro, and then the last time it was like 4 little grains! And the manager came over and tried to say that's how much they usually put. He seriously tried to come over and point at those 4 little pieces and say there's the farro.

There wasn't anyone waiting in the lobby and when the host team asked me how many in my party I said ""three and may we please sit at the tables in the happy hour area."" They directed me to seat myself and I walked over and waited at a 4 top table that needed to be cleaned. Finally after about 10+ minutes, I walked back up to the host station and asked if they could have someone come clean the table so we could sit. The male host said with an attitude ""Miss (which is incorrect--I am a ma'am) these people just came in and I am going to sit them there."" I then replied, ""I've been waiting here for over 15 minutes now for the table to be bused as per your instruction."" He said ""no miss...you requested to sit at the bar not at a table."" I then said, ""no, I requested to sit in the happy hour area at a table. I have two elementary aged children--I wouldn't ever sit at the bar!"" He replied very rudely and in an aggressive tone, (and when I mean aggressive...he stood up taller--which he was about 1 foot taller than me, tightened up every muscle in his face, took a step towards me, glared down at me while answering me in a scolding tone) ""No you requested to sit at the bar and now if you want to sit at a table, you are going to have to wait until everyone has been seated. And, as you can see, there is now a wait."" I turned to my kids who looked so confused and said ""Let's go."" My 9 year old son said ""why was he so mean to us? Why didn't he let us sit. He told us to go sit at the table and he pointed to the table when we walked in."" I just walked out and said ""we will find somewhere else to eat."" I work full time with a 2 hour commute with my children in tow. I am tired and frankly wanted to beat the Friday night rush, eat out and enjoy a nice early dinner with my 2 kids (since my husband has to work late). My money is accepted everywhere else...so I guess we will support some other establishment. We eat out a lot and I will not be going to Cheesecake Factory for a long time...not that they need my business...they are always busy.

Also the shrimp scampi was breaded instead of cooked with wine & garlic! Perhaps there must be new cooks?!!

We were turned away from the restaraunt we originally intended to dine at-""NO DOGS"" on the patio (no sign, they just told us) Went straight to Cheesecake Factory where they welcomed us and our dog as well as another group with their dog.

B. Ellen I.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,4,1.0,4/17/2015,"We came to this restaurant Thursday April 16th about 7:45pm. We walked in just ahead of a large party. We approached the host at the front (young Hispanic guy with a bow-tie) and were told a 15-20 min wait. He offered for us to sit immediately at the bar, but I hate bar benches and wanted to relax. We were given a buzzer and since it was crowded in the lobby, we sat ourselves outside on the bench. As we are leaving, I hear, ""we have a party of 6"" from the group after us. My husband sat on the bench with the buzzer directly next to him on the wooden seat and I got up to look at the menu. There is an open patio with approx 4-7 people in it with 2 different waiters attending to them. 10-min goes by...we are now sitting together on the bench talking, the buzzer directly between us on the wooden bench...15-min goes by...we are playing Candy Crush and Bookworm, respectively. I happen to glance up and there is a couple who is entering, the man with a walker...they go in and come directly out and sit...20-min goes by, I look up and I don't see anyone in the lobby so I get up to check and it's empty. I call my husband over and we go inside. We wait...I tell my husband, ""the party of 6 that came after us is already seated""...He goes up to the counter and talks to the same young, Hispanic guy with the bow-tie. My husband asks about our table. The bow-tie guy tells him, it's going to be 15 min. My husband says, we've been waiting for 20 min. The bow-tie guy tells him, ""it's only been about 4 minutes"". My husband says, ""no, we've been waiting for 20 min...here's our buzzer..it never went off"". The guy looks at it and immediately says, ""we rang it for 5 min and no one answered"".  He then said that he would put us at the top of the list. I'm watching this all transpire from the back of the lobby and my husband then tells me what went on. Since we still have to wait, I tell my husband ""forget it!"" As he walks up to tell the host we aren't going to wait, the couple with the walker is being escorted back to their table. When I was walking out of the door, my husband was giving the buzzer back and all the guy said was ""are you sure?""...SMH. I find this unacceptable. He basically lied and was in-turn, saying we were liars. I will SWEAR under OATH that the buzzer never went off (I mean, have you ever had a buzzer ANYWHERE that DID NOT keep buzzing and buzzing and was lit-up until it got your attention?!?! Besides, it was on a wooden bench...which would have amplified the buzzing to pure annoyance!). His response shouldn't have been that he had done his job and it was OUR FAULT we didn't hear the buzzer!!! He should have called to have us seated IMMEDIATELY! Anyhow, I was so fumed I told my husband there was no way that I could eat there being so upset. So we went to P.F. Changs. MUCH better service and they even comped us an entree when the server mis-ordered our order! Now THAT'S what I call SERVICE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=220

You'll always have leftovers or you can always share with a friend. They have a skinnylicious menu for those with calories on their mind - go with the shrimp pasta!

It's lightly coated breaking was perfect enough for a slight crisp but the Zuccini was cooked perfectly, not hard but not too soft just right! Their ranch is tasty too.

Make sure if you go, you double check your receipt because if it's 6:01, by the time you order something it's getting marked at full price. I've been during non-happy hour times and the cooking is just as mediocre. I got some fried mac n cheese that was still cold in the middle. The Fettucini Alfredo I ordered tasted like preservatives. The cheesecake is shipped in from somewhere and kept in a freezer somewhere until they thaw the slices and serve em up. It's good if you live in Chula Vista and can't drive anywhere.

My favorite cheesecake is the fresh strawberry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=240
Jade D.,"Fredericton, Canada",3,79,29,2.0,6/15/2014,I normally would have nothing but good things to say about Cheesecake Factory but they've really dropped the ball the last 2 times I've ordered from them.  Both times I ordered on a holiday (mothers day and Father's Day) and ended up with half assed dishes with missing sauces or ingredients.  I've also noticed from experience that presentation greatly suffers when you order take out.  Make sure if your ordering out that you open and check all your dishes to make sure everything looks right. It's a pain in the ass and you shouldn't have to but its less aggravating then getting home and realizing that they messed up.  I don't think I'll be coming back for a while.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=240

Amanda B.,"National City, CA",0,5,1,2.0,8/19/2017,"So I usually love the Cheesecake Factory. It's fun and upbeat and the food is always great. However, I'm at dinner with my gf. Who keep in mind is younger than me. I'm 30 yrs old. When I showed the bartender that I only had my paperwork from the DMV and a picture of my old license, she denied me a drink. Even asking her manager if they would accept it in place of my picture ID. She was so consumed with arguing the fact if i was really my age that she never bothered to look at my friends drivers license. She asked but never looked at it. So this to me is unacceptable. You are sure that you cannot serve me a glass of wine but you serve my younger partner a drink without ever glancing at her ID..? To top it off, after telling me she could not serve me and it was against the law, she adds the favorable comment, ""oh well DD it is."" WHO SAYS THAT TO AN UNSATISFIED who customer?!?! Incompetence at its finest. Understandable she couldn't serve me, just doing her job.

Dinner never came out, manager brought it out after we were all done eating saying sorry for the delay, at that point we talk her to box it up.  We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go, waitress came out with box dinner and said sorry and she would comp the cheesecake for our inconvenience.   Long story short,  the chicken plate was thrown out Monday night at home.  Rice was so hard and chicken was soft and falling apart.  Definitely not a dish to take home and attempt to reheat.  I'm very disappointed in the managers attempt to make it better for our experience,  I really think the right thing to do was take that chicken dish off the bill and offer dessert on the house.

Andy A.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,74,168,2.0,10/7/2016,"The only reason I'm writing this review is simply because the manager was definitely not on point this time. Our waiter was excellent! I want to make sure he gets the best credit unfortunately I do not know his name but in speaking with him he loves his job there and he's a great employee!  I ordered the meatloaf because that's what I wanted to eat. not a problem if you have something that  happens and the last piece crumbles I understand. However everything I wanted with the meatloaf; like the sides is what what I wanted. So, the manager tells me there was a mishap and the meat basically disintegrated. That if I wanted to order something else. I told him not really I really want meat and nothing else. I then ask him if he could just throw a steak on the plate because I don't want to change the sides that it came with. The manager then tells me he cannot reinvent the menu because his name is not on the building. I tell him that's obvious but if there's an error way after I ordered my food that they should of came immediately and told me and not waited so long. Again I tell him just pick any steak and drop it in the middle cooked and we'll be done. He says he cannot do that that I have to pick a steak item from the menu. So then I say fine get me that ribeye steak. Well that steak is $27 he says. I don't care give me the $10 steak just put a piece of meat on my plate with the sides of the meatloaf.I don't understand why it's so hard for him especially after waiting so long to get my food which I didn't get. I pretty much will not be going back to this place and will continue to go to the number one cheesecake factory in fashion valley. And I will tell all my friends not to go to the Eastlake cheesecake factory because of this manager who does not know Customer service.

The main focus which was the chicken and tasted under seasoned and reminded of of those sandwiches you get at 711. My wife got the mac and cheese and she also had issues with her dish. The macaroni they used was the bigger shell. Not the standard elbow style some are use to. And the cheese was a bit to salty for one person. Tasted like kosher salt or parmesan got dumped in.

B)  Some of my Yelp friends gave this Cheesecake Factory less than stellar reviews. C) They don't take reservations D) All of the Above You guessed it, it's D.  If you don't know already, Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations.  This is bad business, especially for this one.  Our wait for a table was well over an hour.  Add another 15 minutes for them to take our orders, another 25 minutes to get your food (some of which was delayed), and extra minutes to eat it.  In all, expect to be here 2+ hours for food that is just okay.  We ended up missing our movie because the wait was so long.  As for their food, no huge complaints here.

Their drinks are really good too! My favorite is the pineapple mojito!  I wish they would try to stand out from the chain through their service or something.

I've never had a bad meal here so it's pretty unfortunate for those who have; i.e. while waiting for my table, I overheard a family complaining about an issue with the hostess, yikes. I guess that speaks volumes to Cheesecake Factory's inconsistency, but I'm giving them 4 stars because I've always had a positive dining experience.  I recently came to this location for Easter Sunday brunch with family. We were expecting a wait and were told it would be 30 min (got there around 10:30am) which wasn't too bad. We ordered the egg roll sampler as an appetizer and it was actually pretty good. It came with 4 types of egg rolls and 4 dipping sauces, see picture below. My favorite one was the pork! For my entree I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes since I was craving something sweet and was also looking for something packed with carbs to give me energy for the gym later lol. I'd say these were probably the fluffiest pancakes I've ever had. They came topped with sliced strawberries and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. My only complaint would be that it wasn't lemony enough. There was lemon zest on top but it definitely wasn't enough for me to taste in any bite. Might as well have been called Strawberry Ricotta Pancakes haha.  Our waitress was incredible, very nice and accommodating. She always made sure we had everything we needed, along with each of the other employees that dropped off food at our table.  I guess based off of everyone else's reviews, this location is a hit or miss.

Sometimes I really enjoy it and sometimes the food isn't that great. We took my dog to the dog park and afterwards eat and cheesecake was the only restaurant that let our dog eat with us. plus we like cheesecake for the most part so we came here which worked out for us.  We waited for like maybe 7 min to get seated outside. There was one other family eating outside and I don't know how they felt, but we felt pretty neglected. Yeah we're sitting outside, but shouldn't you check up on us and see how we're doing too.  Anyways I ordered the barbecue ranch chicken salad lunch portion and my mom got the pasta carbonara lunch size also. You can't really go wrong with salad so I enjoyed mine although I do wish it had more dressing. But the pasta she got was way too salty. We didn't even bother to ask our server for a new one because that would have taken another 5 years. It's a good thing I ordered the salad though to even out the saltiness.  I feel like you just have to be lucky to have a good meal here. Other times I come here for pasta it's fine and then other times it's too salty.

The service from the hostess, bartender, to waiter is always exceptional.  The draft beer is always I've cold, and the mixed drinks are always high quality.  I stopped here today to take a little Chtistmas shopping break at the bar. The 22 oz draft Stella was served perfectly. And I'm not a big ""greasy food"" type of eater, but for some reason the Macaroni and cheese cheese burger really caught my attention from the menu. The bartender told me I wouldn't be disappointed. And boy was he right. The medium-rare meat was cooked to perfection and the burger was amazingly good. Loved every single bite of it.  This is definitely one of my favorite places to come out and east when ever I'm in the Otay Ranch area. It can get a little pricy though. The Burger w/ fries + a 22 oz and 16 oz Stella ran me $32.  But hey, you get what you pay for and I'm not complaining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2

Michael M.,"San Diego, CA",2,4,2,1.0,8/12/2016,"Came here for my uncles 30th bday and was shocked at how bad the environment was, how bad service was, and how bad the food was. Maybe my impression of the cheese cake factory was that it was a bit more upper scale but I guess I was wrong in that aspect. My bad. The noise and operations of the restaurant were so loud I had to yell to the person across the table from me just so they could hear. Most the time it just sounded like there were a bunch of dishes being cleared from tables and utensils falling on the floor.  We waited about 50 minutes to be seated which I was fine with. We didn't have reservations and it was prime time on Friday so I knew there would be a wait. The problem was that we were a group of 12 being served by 1 guy and it took 15 minutes to get our drinks and an hour and a half to get our food. Maybe I'm missing something here and that's average time for this size crowd. But the guy couldn't even get the right food in front of the right people. Why even write it down if you're not going to review your notes.  I had high expectations for the food because everyone seems to make a big deal about it. My mistake again. I ordered the chicken bellagio because the ingredients were boss level. It took the hour and a half to come out like I had mentioned before and I was upset at that. When it came out, it looked good and smelled good but it was like licking the ocean floor because it was so salty. It was more salty than this review. Then the waiter reassured me that it would take another 10 minutes to bring out another one. It took nearly 30 minutes and my whole family was already done eating. I tasted the food to make sure it was not salty and BAM!!! Good news. It tasted great. But by that time I lost my appetite and had them put it in a box for me to eat later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=160

I used to work in food service, so I cut servers a lot of slack and I make sure to tip well because I'll always remember how hard it was to be a waitress. But I also give 3 strikes for bad customer service and our waitress definitely hit 3 strikes.  Strike 1: She didn't bring the bread, we were so caught up in our conversations, we didn't realize until hunger hit that we weren't given any bread. It came after the appetizers and after we asked. Strike 2: She never refilled our waters. When we had 4 out of 6 empty glasses, we finally asked whoever was nearby. Strike 3: She never came by to check on us, which is probably why strikes 1 and 2 happened. We couldn't find her most of the time, and when she was within our area she'd visit nearby tables but couldn't be bothered to check in with us. When she was nearby, we tried to get her attention, but she must've forgotten the fact that she was our waitress because she wouldn't even look in our direction. Drinks needed refills, plates were stacking up, and we needed boxes and the bill. Luckily, two other waiters helped out (Chandler was one, but I didn't catch the other one's name). Otherwise, I would've asked for the manager.

My hubby ordered the jambalaya which is his usual meal that he loves from there.

I had to wait an extra 5 to 10 min for them to correct it also my hubby's order didn't taste nearly as good as it usually does so at this point we were very disappointed! Again with some more apologies and we're told there were some new chefs in the kitchen.

Amy L.,"Lake Forest, CA",331,377,288,3.0,10/3/2010,"Love how its right by the mall, but the food is just okay. I definitely go to cheesecake factory more for their desserts and cheesecakes as oppose to their food. There appetizers may actually taste better than their actual dishes. Cheesecake factory has a myriad of tastes and choices, you can get something Asian inspired to Italian pasta.  I love their avocado eggrolls, its definitely enough for lunch if you want something light.  Dishes: jambalaya pasta: disappointing. I ordered this and there was no sauce on it. It was dry, they put sundried tomatoe in it and it was still hard and inedible.  They do however, give a good portion for a good price. It's a great place to go with a huge group of friends who has different tastes and preferences.

Danalee D.,"San Diego, CA",22,195,6,1.0,6/7/2011,"I really like Cheesecake Factory but recently they haven't been so great. What sucks is that they don't take reservations. So if you have a large party, you best hope you don't get there at a busy time. Some past experiences that led me to give them 1 star: - They gave me a water glass that was dirty at the bottom and chunks were floating in it. EWW! Did you not see that as you were filling the cup!? Double EWW! Shame on you! - I ordered a Pasta Di Vinci and the pasta was not even cooked. Yes I know what al dente is. That wasn't. It was just hard. I ended up just eating the chicken and my free bread & butter. I'm always scared of complaining and sending the food back to the kitchen. What if the waiter spits in it!? You will never know! - Another time I ordered the meatloaf. Burnt. Need I say more? - I know the sun is setting but can you not sit us in a booth where it's shining so bright you're blinded by the rays that are reflecting off the menus, plates and silverware. It's a weekday and you have more than half the restaurant with open seating. Oh, it's either this booth or the one next to it? Really!? They're both the same!

Ashley G.,"Fort Pierce, FL",3,22,32,1.0,8/9/2013,"We have come here a few times, with decent service and the food generally good. The last visit, will be just that. I ordered the club sandwich, which came out in about 20 minutes, first bite into it, I notice something extremely difficult to chew- so I spit it out and out comes a broken toothpick. It's as though the expediter broke it off the first time, left it in and just put another in without bothering to take out the original piece. This is extremely dangerous and with such lack of care toward their job, I can no longer trust the  preparations of the food.  The manager came out, apologized and offered to get me a new sandwich (seriously?), and said ""Don't worry, you won't have to pay for this one""- well I hope not! He was only planning on comping my meal, not my husbands nor our 4 year olds. So now, what was to be a family dinner is me hungry, watching them eat and being pretty pissed off. Thankfully our server (John) was more compassionate and understanding and comped our entire bill and gave us a free Cheesecake! Super awesome and kind, definitely wish this guy a great future! I feel like the manager didn't really take into account the severity of a costumer possibly swallowing a toothpick nor that his staff was completely careless and irresponsible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=440
Cesar M.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,12,2,1.0,8/27/2012,"Let me start of by saying that we are avid fans of Cheesecake Factory. Unfortunately, our recent experience at this location has left a real sour taste in our mouth. Upon arrival we had kindly asked the greeter/maitre d to seat us in a certain location of the restaurant in which we like. He gave us an attitude and told us that it would take a while because ""they had to clean the table"" I understood that we would wait 5-10 minutes to get to our table, but the attitude and tone was extremely unnecessary and rude. Upon seating we had noticed how hastily and ill - prepared the table was in comparison to the others around us and was shocked to see food in the crevices of our forks. We had alerted our waitress and she had brought us fresh silverware. After we ordered our food, it arrived at a temperature that seemed colder than it should.""(The Green Sauce  Carnitas Chilaquiles"" Was very cold and tasted very 'cafeteria' like) However we tried to enjoy our brunch the best we could, but we were shocked to find out that  this restaurant has a major FLY problem. 5-10 flys were next to our table, swarming around. Landing on our straws, food, and even table. They were climbing up the windows, and landing on our hair. I & my wife were repulsed by this atrocity, and alerted one of the bus-boys. He claimed to have told the manager, however nothing was done. We ordered over a hundred dollars worth of food, beverages, and cheesecake for our small party of 3, and we left a good tip like honest people. We went into this restaurant hoping for a great Sunday brunch. But ended up getting very bad food, and TERRIBLE service. We really love the food at cheesecake factory and hope to return, but some serious action, and even Pest Extermination, needs to be done. I really hope that someone listens to this comment, because as a paying customer, I feel like I did not receive the service I should have for the hundred dollars I spent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=440

J K.,"San Diego, CA",2,27,19,3.0,12/3/2008,"I ate here on Sunday with my family for lunch. We were seated right after we walked in. While sitting down and browsing through the menu, the first thing I noticed was that everything was a bit expensive. It was also hard to pick something because there were so many different dishes to choose from! Even though I had a hard time picking something, I ended up settling for the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip and the California Cheese steak. The wait for the food (including my family's) was about 30 minutes, so I made a number of trips to the bathroom to kill my boredom. I think that their bathrooms are fairly nice too- they're dimly lit and the sinks make washing my hands more fun! Childish, I know..but it's true. Haha. When we got our food, I wasn't really impressed with my cheese steak. I thought that it tasted plain and that the cheese and meat didn't blend at all. However, the fries were really good. The Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip were to die for though! Even though I wasn't given enough salsa (on the side), they gave me a second serving of it after I asked.. and it was A LOT.  MMMMMM. I suggest that you give it a try, though I prefer the one at Chili's more. xP Here is what my family ordered: Little brother- Double BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger. - All I must say is..WOW. That burger was bigger than his face. He really seemed to enjoy it though. Mom- Fish tacos and some kind of sundried chicken tomato pasta thing. - I didn't try the fish tacos but the pasta thing that my mom ordered had just the right amount of seasonings- it wasn't too little or too much. The flavor was just right. For dessert, we ordered a Chocolate Truffle Cake of some sort but since I was borderline full, just one forkful made me sick. We ended up taking it home but once my stomach settled down, I was able to eat it and actually enjoy it. xP Overall, I like this place. Even though the prices are a bit high and the food is generally okay, I would consider coming here again... just not anytime soon. I thought that the atmosphere was pretty chill and that the waiters were very attentive and polite (ours, especially--such a happy girl!)

When I go I have flashbacks of Gordon Ramsey telling some restaurant owner that his restaurant is a failure because menu is too large and unfocused....it works for Cheesecake Factory! There are some low cal options but I usually go here for a guilty indulgence. I can blow out 2000 calories on accident! I have more favorites than I can even speak of. It is always a delight to be able to take a dessert home. If you and your wife/date/friends all have a different craving, you can all find something on this menu. Great for groups. Just great. I'm not always in the mood for it but it is a my go to when we can't make up our mind. Cheesecake was not for me. Here you can get cheesecake with training wheels. They have flavors that take the bite out of the ""cheesecake"" flavor and soon enough...bam! You like more of the ""cheesecaky"" flavored items.

James C.,"San Diego, CA",531,311,129,3.0,7/1/2008,"I was debating whether to give a review to a popular restaurant like Cheesecake Factory, hereinafter referred to and wrongly abbreviated as CCF, and decided that I would add some trivial advice in the form of outline (or you can use outline as lyrics to a song draft). So here goes: If you are a mall rat  (under 18 and can't find social spot to hang out at besides the theater), go to CCF. If you are desperate, go to CCF. If you are really hungry to the point you see your ribs in the mirror, go to CCF. If you fancy the hostess in the front of CCF, go to CCF. If you want more food, than the money you have in your bank account, go to CCF. If you think your too chic to eat at a fast food joint, go to CCF. If you want to look douche, go to CCF. Bottom line: the food is decent and inexpensive; the atmosphere is bustling like a train depot during rush hour; and the decor is pre-fabricated, cookie-cutter template you would expect from a place like CCF.

I had ordered my 2yo the macaroni from the children's menu, good portion, looked tasty, but I noticed small black pieces in the food.  At first I thought it was pepper but didn't recall them, or any restaurant putting ground pepper on a child's macaroni.  After further inspection and digging through the food, I found larger pieces of what was metal! I pointed it out to the waiter, who offered to bring out another one.  We got the second plate...and same thing!!  I found little pieces of black metal in the food!!!  Granted we were almost done with our meals, my two year old was hungry and couldn't understand why I kept taking his food away when all he wanted to do was eat it.  The waiter never offered to bring out something else on the house.  We politely asked for the check, and mind you I was pretty patient with them during this whole process even though my child was now fussy from not eating, but when I saw he had charged me for a child's meal that wasn't even edible, I made the decision to boycott this place for a while.  I had him remove the item from our bill and explained to him that in my opinion, the least they could of done was offer my son something else to eat free of charge for our hassle and patience.   I never reported these incidences to the Health Inspection Agency, but they are both note worthy to be complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=440

I usually order the same thing every time i come here which is the Louisiana chicken pasta. This by far has to be my favorite pasta dish. The flavor is amazing. Has a little spice to it but not so overwhelming where you're not able to enjoy your food. Highly recommend this pasta. It comes with mushrooms, bell peppers and onions. I usually hold off the onions from my pasta.  Today, my date ordered a Kobe cheeseburger. Words cant even begin to describe how amazing this burger tasted.

Ofcourse it was sweet, but it was perfect, lots of chocolate flavor.   Overall it was a great experience for me. Food and dessert was yummy and our server was very kind. My boyfriend says otherwise, he says ""that place is too pricey for basic food"". Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=140

Paul S.,"Spring Valley, CA",128,414,2841,4.0,11/12/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is a place I go to on occasion. They have a menu (book) that is just huge. The menu is so big that there is something for everybody. From burgers to sandwiches to burritos to pasta to pizza to salads. Cheesecake Factory has you covered even for the real picky eaters. The place is usually packed with wait times of up to 15-20 minutes. Which isn't too bad. The key though is to go to the bar. If your lucky there is empty high table and bar stools. The bar is open seating. You don't have to put your name on the wait list. Just find an available high table or even sit at the bar. At the bar you can order anything off the menu. So that's what I did. While people were still waiting for a table. I just walked in. Sat at a high table at the bar. Got a beer and put in my order for food. Why wait to eat when you don't have to? I ordered the fried mac and cheese in a marinara sauce for my appetizer. It is so good. Crunchy on the outside and hot and cheesy in the inside. So addictive. Couldn't decide off hand on my main course but settled for the Kobe beef burger. Which I was glad I did. Having the burger cooked medium well with onions, mushrooms, melted swiss, tomato and lettuce. The burger wasn't complicated but just plain good. Washed it down with a pint of Karl Strauss Octoberfest. My meal was satisfying. The food was good. The service was friendly. The bill was a little high but not super crazy. I will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=140

And I've never had an awful, low rating warranted experience here.  Located in Otay Ranch mall, great location... Large parking lot, shared with AMC theater.  Their food is typical with food at any other CF... Last night I ordered the Bellagio Chicken (breaded chicken breast over a basil pesto and pasta with prosciutto and arugula greens. The serving was huge and it tasted pretty good. I think I ruined my appetite with all the yummy warm bread they give us! The busy dinner crowd and customer service is consistent with any other CF as well. But our server was awesome and very accommodating to our little ones. She brought them out their own plate of sliced bananas and sliced bread to occupy them while waiting for our order... She also offered hot water in case I needed to heat a bottle... My kids had Mac&Cheese and mini corn dogs. OMG I stole a taste of their corn dog, and i was impressed! It was pretty good!  And of course you can't go wrong with their huge selection of cheesecakes and other cakes for dessert...  I love their food.. The quality and serving sizes are understandable for the prices of their food... But the cheesecakes to me are a little overpriced..

Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4069,28010,4.0,9/20/2014,"I stopped in this Cheesecake Factory to celebrate National Cheeseburger Day and ordered their Americana Burger with a side salad, and of course, I rounded my eating experience with a decadent Red Velvet slice of cheesecake.  The burger came with American and cheddar cheese, crunchy potato crisps, lettuce, tomato, tender grilled Onions, pickles and their house made secret sauce on sesame egg bun ( ). I asked them to prepare the meat at a medium or pink all the way through and they delivered nicely ( ). The beef was juicy, tender, and had a very good beefy flavor that lingered on the palate. I liked both cheeses on the burger because the American melted easily, but the cheddar held up well and stated firm and sharp, so I got best of both worlds. The potato crisp added great texture and salty element to the burger, and the secret sauce brought the burger together nicely ( ). I was quite fond of this burger and was happy I had it on National Cheese Burger Day. The side salad was fresh and crispy, and I ordered it with their balsamic vinaigrette which was very good. It was the perfect go between the rich burger and such. The red velvet cheesecake was bliss. My sever Mitra I believe her name was, which I will correct when I find my receipt, if I am wrong, recommended it as her personal favorite. The slice was beautifully layered with cheese cake filling, white chocolate, and of course red velvet cake ( ). It was very rich in a very good way, and the red velvet cake was moist and flavorful. I was impressed with the great flavor and creamy texture of the actual cheesecake ( ).  On the outside, there was some curled up white chocolate morsels that added nice texture but not much flavor ( ). I was hoping they had that sweet white chocolate flavor but they did not. Nevertheless, a nice slice of cheesecake. My server was great. She had a friendly personality and was well verse in the in and outs of the the menu, especially their abundant of cheesecake offerings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=140

It's nice to get the same experience sans the fight for parking or the 30+ minute wait on a Friday night for a table for 4. Spent many a family lunch and dinner here when it first opened. The most recent visit the wifey and I rolled up at 5pm. No wait for a table for 4. The table location was a booth but we got neglected by our waitress for the first 25 minutes. I suspect we were the furthest table she took care of and it wasn't until she gave the table to another waitress that service improved. Complimentary bread was and still is amazing.  the white bread is sourdough - I think it's alright but never been a fan.  The dark wheat bread though - addicting. One of the few restaurants that does free bread so well. Especially when it's fresh baked and warm...yummy. Food is always delicious but a bit pricey. $11.50 for a plain hamburger and salad w/ balsamic dressing. That was off of their skinnylicious menu where all items were 590 calories or less. Lunch prices were in the same range with dinner hitting the $15-$25 range. I'll still be back occasionally. The bread and food is always solid but a bit pricey. Service is not perfect but still good, on other occasions it's been consistently better.

The rest of the pieces seemed fine.... or I just didnt notice. But the last piece was cooked liked ""Seared Ahi""..... cooked on the outside and raw in middle.  I'm not the type to make a huge deal of things, so I politely informed the waiter that the chicken was raw and I showed it to him. I just let him know to let the cooks know to cook the chicken more thouroughly, so that they wont have trouble with other people.  The manager promptly came over and wanted more details on the incident. He took the item off the bill, without me asking. I wasnt even looking to do that because I had eaten the whole thing practically. I just wanted to inform them so the cooks need to watch it in the future.  If they didnt take me seriously, then I would've made a huge deal of it. But they were very professional about it and profusely apologized for the incident, which was nice.

Erica P.,"Chula Vista, CA",54,45,5,3.0,3/5/2009,"This review would've been higher if it weren't for the fact that I enjoyed my appetizer so much more than my main course.  So, my boyfriend and I decided to go here for our anniversary. I had heard that the location at the Fashion Valley Mall had some ghastly wait times and that they didn't take reservations! :( I called ahead anyway (to our Chula Vista chain) and I was surprised to hear the estimated time to be 15 minutes or less.  We arrived, and were seated almost immediately. I really liked the service and the atmosphere. We went ahead and ordered after browsing the huge menu. I decided on the Chicken Carbonara Pasta and my boyfriend, being the Southern Boy that he is, went with the Chicken and Biscuits. We also ordered an appetizer of fried Macaroni and I ordered a small bowl of their soup of the day, which happened to be Cream of Chicken and Artichoke Soup. When the appetizer and my soup arrived, I was so enamored by the presentation. The Macaroni balls were so elegantly placed on the plate that I dorked out and took a picture. (I'm BIG on presentation). I reluctantly took on from the plate and took a bite. I can't even describe how wonderful the flavor was! It was perfectly fried and the macaroni was so savory. My soup paled in comparison, but was still wonderfully delicious.  After my wonderful appetizers, I was anxiously anticipating what could be next! When our meals arrived, my pasta looked fairly simply laid out, but my boyfriend's Chicken and Biscuits had us cracking up. They made the nice country comfort food look so high class and elegant. I think it partially put off my boyfriend for just that. I tried my pasta, but found it to be lacking in flavor. A few more bites had me craving another round of Macaroni balls and soup. I noticed my boyfriend picking at his dish, and I found he was experiencing the same issue I had; the food was just too bland.

If anything stood out it wouldve been the ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"". I'm not a fan of red velvet cake so imagine my suprise when I tasted what had to be the best cheesecake ever!!!! My second experience didnt fare any better then the first. For appetizers I ordered the cheese triangles, stuffed mushrooms, and crab artichoke dip. I didnt taste the cheese triangles as they were meant for the kiddos. But, you know its pretty bad when a 5 year old comments that its burnt and refuses to eat it. I love stuffed mushrooms and lets just say I took one bite and decided to pass. My 11 year year old on the other hand found it tasty and ate about 2 or 3 of them. The crab artichoke tasted like watery claim chowder. I took one bite and decided to send it back. It was supposed to be crab meat and artichoke but from the taste and looks of it I would say it was shredded tilapia with chunks of potatoe. Now on to the main dish. I ordered the Steak Dianne and Shrimp Scampi with mashed potatoes. The steak was ""okay"" it tasted like a heated tv dinner drowned in gravy and sliced mushrooms. The shrimp was horrible! I've never had battered, deep fried, shrimp drowned in tomatoes and spinach classified as scampi. Lets just say I ate less then half of one shrimp. You know your meal is pretty bad when your staring at your childs cheese and pepperoni pizza as if its the best dish on the table. In hopes of saving what had already been a total loss I ordered the red velvet cheesecake to go. I was not disappointed. In my opinon if your looking for a decent meal in the area. Go to Chilis and fill yourself up with those honey chipotle chicken crispers. Or if your into Asian Cusine stop by P.F. Changs and order a few barbeque spare ribs. On your way home stop by the Cheesecake Factory for the Ulimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. In all honesty they need to stick to what they know, ""Cheesecake"". The food is horrible.

Why 4 stars, well the server was slow, they didnt even acknowledge it was my birthday. I obviously wasnt expecting anything free but a ""happy birthday"" would not have gone amiss!

Today, I had a hard time picking something to eat over the phone. I called and placed an order and then called back to change my order to a salad because, I decided I didn't want to eat a bunch of carbs after eating three scoops of icecream.  As I waited on the phone for about 7 minutes then I finally spoke to someone and changed my order and then he wanted to place me on hold again to have me speak with a manger and I told him that I was put on hold, and I will be picking up my salad in 25-30 minutes and he said okay, thank you. My sister picked up my salad and there was no cheese on the endive salad, no butter for the bread, I wasn't hungry anyways and had given it to my mother.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=340

I love their soups as well, they are pretty tasty. Lunch/Dinner: Tied for my #1 spot are: Miso Salmon (has the miso sauce with a bit of sweet teriyaki on the salmon), Shrimp Scampi pasta (large shrimp with a special crust and the roasted garlic and the delicious creamy garlic sauce) OMG I fell in love the first time I ate it and keep falling in love, every time I eat it!!) #2 spot would have to be their Chicken madera, #3 would be the Steak diane (with the grilled onions) ooh my, their herb crusted salmon.   Dessert: My ultimate favorites are the red velvet cheesecake and the caramel macadamia nut cheesecake.  OMG!! Just amaazing!  But if you are on a diet, share the low carb cheesecake! It's pretty darn good too! Drinks: Non alcoholic would have to be the sweetened Green tea!  OMG it's free refills.

She: Traffic is awful at 5:30 Other She: Wait a minute, last time we went somewhere close to Mikey, and before that close to you...it's time that it is close to me. Me: So Cheesecake Factory? She: There or D'Lish... OS: or Zorba's? She: Let's do Zorba's for lunch some other time...let's go have cheesecake Me: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY! (I always get my way) Yeah, it's a chain.  But it is always consistent no matter which location you go to.  The service is always pleasant, not much personality, but friendly and efficient.   My favorite dish is one of their most popular ones: CHICKEN MADEIRA Sauteed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce.  Served with Mashed Potatoes. That night I realized that this is the only dish I order when I'm here, and this is the only dish I will order.  But I don't come here very often for obvious reasons...I'd weigh a zillion pounds.  This dish is so good, that my friends order it as well and share.  Whatever you do, DO NOT order the Asian food...if you want orange chicken...go to Peking Chop Suey in North Park. We also order an appetizer, and I really wanted the fried macaroni and cheese...who ever came up with this artery clogging, fat inducing dish deserves a Nobel for coming up with this.  If you fry it, people will eat it.  The girls didn't want it, so we settled for the hot dip of Spinach, Artichoke Hearts, Shallots, Garlic and a Mixture of Cheeses Served Bubbly Hot with Tortilla Chips and Salsa. (Okay, so sometimes I don't get my way.) We then ordered a BLT salad: Crisp Iceberg Lettuce Covered with Fresh Tomato, Bacon, Chopped Egg and Blue Cheese. Served with Our Bacon Dressing.  This was really good...it was like the sandwich without the bread.  I normally don't have a salad, but we split it, and I didn't have lunch so, WTH. For dessert I ordered the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.  It's the only one I consistently order.  Except for Hawaii, where they have some kind of passion fruit thing.  Speaking of which, they serve this tropical iced tea which is pretty good.  The girls shared some macadamia nut thing...I'm selfish and never share my cheesecake, well except with the partner...and even that's hard for me to do.  What can I say, I just loves dessert.  I like this location because it's never really that crowded and it's adjacent to a mall.  The only thing that sucked was that I needed to pick up something out in El Cajon.  I took the exit to the 125 and then I got hit with a toll for taking the expressway.  I couldn't turn around and go back, and I couldn't blaze through without getting a ticket.   So I paid the 3 bucks...I know it's not much, but I wasn't prepared...so there I was scrambling in my car for loose change, on a freeway on ramp, with a couple cars behind me...WTH?  What happened to just getting on a freeway???",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=340

What did I have?  I had their Wild Mushroom Flat bread only 440 calories and oh so tasty.  The flat bread was crunchy, there was plenty of gooey cheese and large slices of mushrooms.  The flavors blended perfectly.  I also had the White Bean Hummus, this was absolutely delicious (I didn't check the calories).  I don't believe this came from the Skinny menu, but I was with a Vegetarian and this was a great starter for us.  my Veggie daughter ordered a grilled eggplant sandwich and LOVED it.  My french bulldog just loved sleeping on the warm concrete in the sun, it was a cool day and this helped her warm up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=180

Went on a Sunday afternoon withy wife before the dinner rush so we were able to get a seat right away. Only problem I had with that was there were plenty of seats and the host just had to seat us directly next to another couple in the dining room... So my wife and I had about 20 minutes of awkward conversation until they finished and left. I'd have preferred some socially acceptable space so I didn't feel like I was eavesdropping on their conversation, or them on mine. Just weird and unappreciated. Food was good as usual though. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal; one minor thing I noticed, they did get a little cheap with the dipping sauces for our appetizer. We split an order of the buffalo meatballs, with there was hardly any sauce with it. Is dipping sauce really that expensive that they cut back on that now? Jeez! Anyway, my wife had the Chicken Madeira and I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich. Both meals were very satisfying. And since it also happened to be my birthday, we also ordered dessert. I had vanilla cheesecake, my wife had lemon meringue cheesecake. Both were very good, after all it better be for their name sake! The only other feedback I have is the service could have been a little more attentive. I only had my drink refilled once and would have liked a third glass of coke zero but the server dropped off & retrieved the check without asking/noticing.

I have had great meals and the very next time have everything completely horrific. I have had wonderful waiters and waitresses and I have had servers not check on us for 20+ minutes, forget to bring bread, take their break in the booth behind us without anyone else covering. So what does it tell me? Poor management and inconsistent service. It's too bad, because it has the capacity to be a very good restaurant.

Renee R.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,45,5,1.0,1/18/2016,"This was my first time at this location and probably my last. Hubby and I came here to check the place out because next month we are treating a friend for her birthday and wanted to see if this would be a good place to go. We came here Sunday around 3:30 pm. Before we got seated, I used the restroom, and had to complain to the desk that the restroom needed attending to. It was filthy! I use a walker, and had to maneuver through paper towels that were strewn all over the floor Waited 10 min. for a table, was seated, waited another 20 min. to have our order taken, I asked for water ( I was informed that they don't serve straws with their water and was asked if I wanted one, I said Yes, and never got it. No biggie) I ordered a Grilled Chicken Avocado Club sandwich and sweet potato fries ($1 extra). Hubby ordered Roasted Turkey Sandwich and fries. We waited over 30 min. for our food. The place was pretty packed and all around us were tables of 4-13 people, so I knew it would be a wait. When our food finally came, my sandwich was cut in half, piled with thick cut tomatoes-3 halves on EACH half of sandwich! There was 1 tiny piece of HARD bacon on each sandwich, a smear of avocado, and a piece of cold chicken ,which had NO GRILL MARKS ( thought it was a ""GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICH""?) and the meat on each was the size of a 50 cent piece! The sweet potato fries were barely warm, and tasted like they had been microwave re-heated, and the plate was scalding hot! Hubby said his fries were barely warm too. The only good thing was the cheesecake. We ordered the Hershey's cheesecake and split it. I didn't bother complaining because they were so busy, and we had already spent 2 hours there, and had had enough. I was really disappointed. Guess we will find somewhere else to take our friend to for her birthday.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=380

Angel C.,"Honolulu, HI",92,223,265,4.0,2/1/2009,"I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory one too many times thanks to family or friends..though I'm not complaining. My last visit was a week ago for my birthday. Here are the dishes I'd recommend: Miso Salmon - The flavor and texture of the salmon was just right with that miso sauce..mmm. I loved how the salmon sat on a bed of rice cooked just right. The four snap peas served as nice garnish and an extra crunch. Chicken Bellagio - This dish is best if you're not on a diet. It's part of their limited-time menu, so order it while you can. The dish is basically two breaded chicken breasts, topped with prosciutto (Italian ham) and arugula. All of this sits on a small bed of spaghettini and some sort of cream sauce. Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo - Filling and comforting, period. Other notes: I'm a huge fan of pasta, but I'm not fond of CF's pasta dishes, besides the Chicken Bellagio. I'll order their smoothies only if I feel like splurging since they're a bit pricey. One of the servers named Josh still works here, and he is as friendly and prompt as ever. Overall, I love CF!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=380

I believe her name was Victoria or something, who knows......after we moved, she came and took our order and that was the last we saw of her, she never came and checked on us at all, altho the guy server next to our table was kind enough to ask if we were doing ok.  Obviously we left him the tip.  on another note, we usually get the chinese chicken and share and they kitchen is always so kind to split it unless its our waiter/waitress that does it but this time it wasn't and i was like WTH......Im not even hungry anymore after waiting a half hour to order.

We were finally seated and service was amazing. Our server Tammy was so helpful. So damn quick. Everything came so fast. We did end up ordering way too much food.  We started out with the calamari. After eating the bread and calamari....I was already full... Then here comes the ""ultimate eggplant sandwich.""  I took a look at it and was full. The sandwich is MASSIVE. I always have this problem when I go eat out. I try to order food that is not messy. As I was saying.......they should have an option next to the menu that says ""M"" for messy. My sandwich was too big to eat so quickly. It got a bit soggy and I could not finish it. It was tasty but too much.  The lover ordered the meatloaf and he was not even hungry. The portions were ridiculous. So much food. We could of just had 2 appetizers and called it a night.  Overall.... I had a great time here.

In the time I've been gone they added some new items to their already huge menu. This time I had the Monterrey Burger. The Monterrey burger is big, so open wide, really wide if you want this one to fit in your mouth. It's presentation really impressed. Abundant greenery and thinly slice onions just the way I like them, Woah! is that half an avocado, sliced and shaped like a sea shell? All of this sits on a large sheet of cheese, and a fat patty cooked to your specification. Perhaps the biggest appeal to me was the ""secret sauce"" that comes with it.  What's in it? Option of fries or salad. I took the salad option with blue cheese dressing. Wow, there was some huge chunks of blue cheese in there. I was absolutely fabulous.

We tried the Tex Mex Eggrolls which were delicious and the Bud Light was $3 a bottle. Our appetizer came out quick and they also gave us their complementary bread. We then ordered our entrees which I asked for the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich which came with fries and my choice of spicy buffalo sauce. It was definitely on the spicy side however was good none the less. My boyfriend had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta which he enjoyed as well however mentioned it seemed like it had been sitting under the warming lamps for a while.

We got the outside patio on a perfect weather night. Our server was the delightful DESIREE D. This young lady was very knowledgeable on the menu items. She was very attentive and courteous with us. Considering some of the people running around on this very busy night, she was calm and confident (no hectic running) with us and her other tables. My sister commented to DESIREE that she must have a great memory as she was not writing down any of our order. Everything from drinks, entrees (with modifications) and desserts came exactly as ordered with no concerns. This is the server I want everytime I dine out.

This is only the third Cheescake Factory that I've been to.  Until this one, when I was in the San Diego area, I/we usually went to the one at the Fashion Valley mall.  I've also been to the one in Las Vegas in the Caesar's Palace mall.  I haven't eaten at the ones in NJ for some reason. On this visit with the folks on the last night of a recent trip, I ordered the seared tuna with the wasabi topping.  It was a very satisfying meal like all other meals I've had at other Cheescake Factory restaurants.  I also could not stop eating the bread.  My parents split the herb-crusted salmon salad which they seemed to really like.  I also had a microbrew but can't remember the name.  It might have been an ale and it was pretty good.  For dessert, I had a few scoops of the cheesecake made with splenda.  It was ok.  I much prefer the caramel cheesecake which I had at the Vegas location.

Then another hostess seated the couple that came in after us.. I brushed it off as a miscommunication between the hostesses and didn't say anything. Then the original hostess walked right by us ( after what seemed like talking to the other hostess about the mix up or something and looked straight at me) and grabbed the other couple that came in after us, I stopped and asked her when we would be seated and she told us it was getting worked out then proceeded to seat the couple that came in two couples after us.

How do they expect to turn tables when it takes at least 10 minutes for someone to read the entire menu let alone decide if they want Italian, British, Mexican, or Chinese food.  Oh yeah, they also have sandwiches and burgers and steaks and breakfast. I had the Shepherd's Pie which for some reason was a meat concoction in large flat bowl with some mashed potatoes on top...it didn't even appear to have been baked and certainly wasn't baked in the bowl like I had hoped.

We had dinner at this particular Cheesecake Factory location after the movie screening and sat at the bar. We were greeted and waited on by Jeremy. He was very pleasant and attentive and just gave overall great service. My friend and I had a comfortable, overall great experience with our food and drinks (btw, the summer rolls and the White Chicken Chili on the Skinnylicious Menu are DELICIOUS!).

Timothy B.,"San Diego, CA",80,132,17,1.0,8/10/2010,"My daughter wanted to eat here for her birthday.  I tried to talk her out of it because (and you may take this in consideration when you read this review) I do not like big corporate restaurants.  The experience we had demonstrates why I have this prejudice.  We fight our way to the check-in desk and I say ""two for lunch.""  I am told there will be a twenty minute wait.  I respond by saying, ""Outside is fine"" as it was a pleasant day and there were many empty tables outside.  I am told that we will be seated in a couple of minutes.  Twenty minutes goes by and we are finally seated outside.  There are only two other tables with customers at that time and many empty tables.  After a long wait the first waiter comes and wants to know what we want to drink.  My daughter orders a smoothie and I order water.  Another waiter shows up with a bread basket about five minutes later and leaves.  A third waiter comes to take our order.  We both order cheeseburgers.  I am asked how I want my burger cooked.  I respond ""medium-rare"".  About twenty minutes later the burgers arrive.  My daughter takes hers and I take the medium-rare burger.  The burger is cooked longer than a fast food restaurant's.  It is shoe leather.  As I am hungry and not wanting to upset the help I eat it anyways.  When done, my daughter gets a chocolate cheesecake.  At least that was ok.  This lunch for two cost over $50 with no alcoholic drinks.  I don't know how you can mess up cooking a burger but they did.  I don't mind paying $10 for a hamburger but for that price, it should be cooked to order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=480

Derek M.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,8,5,1.0,6/30/2013,"I took my daughter out to eat at the Cheesecake Factory for her High School graduation.  There were four us in our party. The place was not busy. So the server comes out  to our table trying to make conversation by asking what brings you here, what school did you graduate from, what are your plans afterwards, what college are you going to attend and he kept going on and on. My daughter and our group felt very uncomfortable. Felt like an interrogation.  Anyway, we ordered our meal and asked for water and to keep the water coming because we had been standing for the last three hours for my daughters graduation. Well, the water did not come. The order was screwed up, we asked for some brown bread and were told that they were out. But, then I noticed a few tables were being served that same bread. I asked the server about and he did not know anything about it. I am not saying because my daughters boyfriend is African American the service was poor.  My wife ordered a drink and was waiting 20 minutes and still it had not arrived. I asked the server and He did not know what was going on.  I replied, ""I guess its like the bread and you just ran out.""  A few minutes later the manager came out and apologized and took more of our time. By that time, the dinner was already destroyed and the event became one that you wanted to take the morning after pill to just forget. The manager offered to take the drink we did not receive off the bill and one slice of cheesecake. I did not want to argue even though I felt it was a slap in the face. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I even  gave a 18% tip for probably the worst meal of my life. The only reason why, I did not want too look cheap in front of my daughter and did not want to destroy   her special day any further. This was my first visit to the cheesecake factory and my last time. As my daughter got into her boyfriend's , I saw the look on my daughter's face and she was crying.

Lahnna E.,"San Diego, CA",200,193,15,4.0,7/29/2009,"I pretty much always have a good experience at The Cheesecake.  I like that you get a ton of options.  On the downside, their encyclopedia of a menu aids in my indecisiveness.  I can only shudder to think how much money those menus cost to produce on top of the fact that they roll out new food stuffs all the time. Anyway, I like going here when I want some consistent comfort food.  This particular location is a drive for me, but it's A LOT less busy than Fashion Valley and its congregation of touristy shoppers.  My ex took me here last year for my birthday dinner and our waitress that night was exceptional.  Very friendly and easy to talk to and she was from Massachusetts! I always get edamame as an appetizer wherever I can find it.  It's a pretty hard dish to screw up and it's oh-so-yummy.  With drinks, it varies.  Sometimes I want a mojito, a margarita (the Ultimate and the Del Rey are very good), beer, a martini, or lemonade.  I'm one of those experimental chicks.  (ooh la la) Meals here are great.  I steer clear of the salads and pasta dishes because they are too huge.  A Caesar salad the next day isn't very appetizing to me.  However, the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta is pretty damn good reheated.  I love their chicken entrees here though.  I now pretty much always get the Chicken Madeira.  It easily has to be one of their best dishes served with asparagus (love!) and mashed potatoes (love love!). And then there's cheesecake.  I miss their Pineapple Upside Down.  So much actually that I always mention it when I eat here.  Like a pouty little kid but worse because food coma is setting in!  I love the Tiramisu, Dulce de Leche, Pumpkin, Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cakes.  Yes, I've eaten A LOT of freakin' cheesecake.  These guys will also whip you up a mean mocha, or latte served in a glass with a straw.

Fonso P.,"La Mesa, CA",78,98,19,3.0,4/3/2009,"A few weeks ago I tagged along with my family as they headed to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch on Sunday. I was still reeling from Saturday night and figured some greasy food would do me good. When we arrived, we were expecting a long wait. The hostess suggested patio seating, so that we would get seated quicker (10 min vs. 30+ min). We gladly accepted.  What she didn't mention, was that we were gonna be directly under the sun, like ants under a magnifying glass.  Apparently, they couldn't open the umbrellas because some people sitting in the shade were chilly and had the heater going, and they can't open them next to a running heater. Whatever, thanks anyways.  While other waitresses kept trying to bring us food we didn't order, our waitress seemed like she was with it. She was nice enough too, she kept refilling our drinks, keeping us hydrated and all, but the overall service was really slow.  Everything (bringing the food, the dessert, the bill) took about twice as long as usual.  I don't know if that's how they normally operate, or maybe they just happened to be really busy that day. Luckily, the sun's position changed and eased up a bit towards the end of our meal.  Oh yeah, speaking of the meal; the pizza was alright, the mac n' cheese was good, and the banana cheesecake was great.  2 star dining experience and 4 star banana cheesecake = 3 star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=420

As for the bar food, my favorites are the fried mac and cheese, Vietnamese summer rolls, sliders and pot stickers. On the menu my favorites are the stuffed chicken tortillas (a Caribbean spin on a Mexican dish), the chicken and biscuits, the shepherds pie and the hamburgers. Their three beers on tap are: Stella Artrois, Karl Strauss Amber Lager and Fat Tire. You can't beat that. And the cocktails are excellent as well, although a bit pricey. If you want something happy and exciting but non-alcoholic give the Strawberry Lemonaid a try.

Isaiah N.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",46,359,22,1.0,3/29/2009,"For some odd reason, the service at this Cheesecake Factory was downright TERRIBLE for me. I was with a party of nine people and I placed my name on the waiting list (which the staff said would be around 30 minutes). Typically, Cheesecake Factory is a busy place where you place your name on the wait list with the hope you would be seated on time. Unfortunately, the wait turned into an HOUR, even as others that came after us were seated.  But eventually we were seated, and the manager gave us an appetizer ""on the house"" for waiting such a long time. And we got bread (white only, since by the time we were seated all the wheat bread was gone). While the waiter had everyone else's order right, my order was botched. They made the wrong dish! What's up with that? To the waiter's credit, I did receive my correct order in 10 to 15 minutes' time. But even then, it felt like at times that it would only be until closing time that I would get my food. :( Thus, based on the mostly rubbish service and my botched order, I would avoid eating at this particular Cheesecake Factory.

Doug D.,"San Diego, CA",3,30,7,1.0,6/27/2015,Now I realize why this restaurant is not even four star. Kid Host Person unfriendly. No welcome or goodbye. But how does one teach etiquette to someone whose  highlight of the day is probably eating at McDonalds. Professionalism at the podium for the initial greeting is critical. Tables filthy along with spotted silverware and menus so dirty that one needs hand sanitizer after reviewing. My server today her first name starts with the letter M. Uniform in total disarray with disgusting stained white shirt and her hair looked like it hadn't been touched in a week. I was grossed out. Service throughout the meal...too many inconsistencies to even mention here. On this occasion food was very good but simple. Caesar salad and Cobb salad. I was so disappointed for the second time with the cleanliness and service of this place I had to call the manager Amy who's not the General Manager but I'm assuming his assistant. She took down all my concerns and was gracious. This may sound odd but she was the only highlight because she knew what I was talking about and agreed. I'm a former Food and Beverage Director in Las Vegas and San Diego and I give a lot of leeway when it comes to service as I understand things happen. But an unprofessional service staff...there is no excuse for it. Too much standing around when they can be polishing silverware and cleaning menus and training. This is a Manager problem as they must be hesitant to delegate  or instruct their staff for some reason.  I told Amy today I want nothing from this place but just to bring it to her attention. My experiences in Las Vegas with Cheesecake Factory in the Venetian and other places is five star. Maybe it's because of the Nevada Health Department takes things more seriously and it doesn't in San Diego which is probably too laid back. And if that's not the case then the service staff is definitely too laid back and I can sense they don't know or don't care about guest retention.  Bottom line profits at the Cheesecake Factory must be doing great because I don't know how Corporate allows mediocrity to continue.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=300

We then went on with our orders. When I asked for my option of course the restaurant ran out of turkey burgers. And then she showed me a list of all the items that were unavailable for whatever reason. I don't know if that's how this restaurant works but it is unacceptable in my book.

They have happy hour from 4-6 M-F.  It loses a star because my favorite bartender  (Boma)  has moved to another location.   I've practically tried almost every dish on the menu.  The latest and greatest that has appealed to me are the following: Arugula Salad: Marcona Almonds, Golden Raisins, Parmesan, Lemon and Olive Oil Ahi Tartare: Raw Tuna with Avocado and Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce. Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip: A delicious Blend of Crab, Artichokes, Cheese and Sour Cream. Served Warm with Grilled Sourdough Bread. Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger: Smoked Bacon and Melted Cheddar with Crispy Onion Rings and B.B.Q. Ranch Sauce. Monte Cristo Sandwich: Crunchy French Toast Stuffed with Bacon, Grilled Ham, Scrambled Eggs and Melted Swiss Cheese Dusted with Powdered Sugar and Served with Strawberry Preserves. Crab Hash: A Delicious Blend of Sautéed Crab, Red, Yellow and Green Peppers, Onions and Potatoes. Topped with Poached Eggs and Hollandaise Sauce.

Edward R.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,10,4,2.0,6/4/2014,"Never in my life have I had such a horrible experience at a restaurant. Being one of the few groups waiting, we were informed of a 1-1.5 hour wait. We spoke to the curly-haired hostess regarding the possibility of splitting our part of 11 into two groups to get seated quicker. She strongly recommended we wait it out for all 11 of us to sit together.  As we waited a full two hours, we managed to grab a few drinks only to see parties of 4-8 people being seated left and right. It wasn't till after the two hour mark, were we finally seated.  I felt pretty embarrassed being ridiculed by some poor decision made by such an amateur hostess. Two of my guests were of age 85 and 86 and I was embarrassed to keep them out past 11:30pm when we had gotten to the restaurant by 8.  Keep in mind, we called the day prior only to be denied any reservation due to ""store policy."" On top of such a horrible experience before the meal, it was a slap in the face to see that the guests being seated before us (who arrived well after we did) so happened to be a vast majority of america (white) descent. While this bias may simply be coincidental, it's no excuse for being seated at a table where we have to wait 10 minutes for their signature bread and butter. Fortunately, a couple of drinks made the 30minute additional wait for food go by rather quickly.  While the food probably met company standards, the frustration and stress caused as a result of a poor, unorganized, unconcerned hostess was unacceptable.  I felt horrible that our server had to be a part of our unpleasing experience. He had the enthusiasm to provide a great experience but after the wait we were't having much of it. Props to him (bald guy I didn't catch his name). He did the best he can to make the remainder of our experience positive; as we have experienced at CCF in the past.  At the end of the night we still tipped our $300 bill and enjoyed a night with a couple of good drinks (shoutout to Josh the bartender).  My advice: Keep up the good work and re-train (or get rid of) hostesses that can't handle the responsibility of being the first impression of the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=300

They both knocked my socks off! The salad is mixed greens, grilled asparagus, beets, goat cheese, candied pecans in a balsamic vinaigrette.

Service was very good and our waitress was nice but the food we ordered left a lot to be desired. I've eaten a few times at the Fashion Valley location and don't remember the food being this bad. Our waitress brought bread and butter out but the bread seemed like it had been sitting out a while. Whatever, we were hungry so we slapped some butter and we ate some of it. For our appetizer, we ordered the Buffalo Blasts. I usually always order these but let me just say that on tonight's order I never found the chicken in some of them. It also seemed like the inside of them weren't cooked all the way. I ordered the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo. First piece of chicken that I put in my mouth had to spit out because it felt like I was chewing on rubber. It was honestly pretty disgusting. The pasta was not cooked well and the Alfredo sauce had no flavor. My friend said her order was ok. We did not have any cheesecake tonight. I just got home and now my stomach is starting to bother me. I'm sure it's something that I ate at Cheesecake Factory.

Once the dinner came my order was totally wrong.  I ordered: Clam Chowder Soup & Salad with extra croutons.  I got: Potato Soup & Salad with no croutons.

Laura D.,"San Diego, CA",284,223,362,4.0,12/15/2013,"If you want to eat at a Cheesecake Factory without all the fuss from the Fashion Valley location then come here. The wait is usually 5-15 minutes which isn't bad at all.  The place is very large and spacious and has a great bar area. If the wait is longer than 20 minutes my family and I usually just grab a table by the bar. If you have a large party then this is the place to come. They're very accommodating to large parties but if you're a group of teens just remember to be polite. I know a lot of waiters don't like looking after a bunch of wild teens.  As for the food, it's just your standard Cheesecake Factory food. The burgers are great here! I usually get a burger whenever I come. Other items that I love are the Miso Salmon, the Chicken Salad Sandwich, and the Pasta DaVinci.  If you find that Cheesecake Factory is a bit overpriced then come here during lunch! You basically get the same portion for a couple dollars cheaper. The lunch pasta is still huge for just $11! The Renee's Special is another great lunch special which includes half a sandwich, salad, and a soup. It's a great deal if you ask me. The service can sometimes be hit or miss though, that's where I take off a star. Sometimes you get great service and other times you barely get a visit from your waiter, he/she forgets everything, and the food takes forever! Also you can't just play on your phone here since the reception is horrible. Just keep asking for more free bread and you'll be ok.

Dee M.,"Vista, CA",669,814,2965,3.0,10/27/2011,"It's your typical CCF, but this is a smaller more intimate location. I love that you can get in and out without the typical one or two hour wait. Our wait was 20 minutes - on a Saturday night. Score!  My sweetie's salisbury steak was not cooked. No bueno! Our server did take it back immediately though. And of course, as it is with all Cheesecake Factory's, the manager offered to comp our meal.  Yes please.  Sadly though, there was like a 30 minute wait because they ran out of gravy for the steak...WTF! I really enjoyed my spicy crispy beef though. I just wish I could have finished it.  The funny thing is, as full as I was I still managed to take a piece of Hershey's chocolate cheesecake home. Please pray for me.  The service very good. The only downside is that it's not in my neck of the woods, so I can't say I would frequent this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=280
Jessica C.,"Chula Vista, CA",44,139,92,3.0,4/30/2011,"I've been here many times and tonight I came again with my family for my sister's birthday.  I absolutely love the decor inside!  It's always very clean and I have always had excellent service. I was a little disappointed that they didn't take reservations.  Boo. The food is good, but not ""omg I love this place"" good, you know?  Their menu is seriously overwhelming.. they have sandwiches, pizzas, pasta, steak, seafood, burritos, asian food, salad, burgers, a bunch of other random things, and of course, cheesecake.  Perhaps I'd like this place more if I was actually a fan of cheesecake?  Who knows. One of my favorite things here is their kobe burger.  It's awesome when it's made right.  The past two times I've had it, I ordered it medium well and it came out well done.. womp womp, but the first time was great.. so I guess I'll start ordering it medium & hope for medium well! Tonight I had the four cheese pasta with chicken and it was just as good as when I had it the first time.  We also had the sliders and the fried mac & cheese for our appetizers and both were awesome!!  I loved the fried macaroni and cheese!! I ate 2 of the 4 little balls they gave us!!  The sliders were good too!  I also tried some of my boyfriend's crispy beef entree and it was pretty good. We came around the time the sun was setting so all we had was what we left of the sunlight and the weak dim ceiling lights.. my parents couldn't see their food!!  I guess it's supposed to create a romantic atmosphere or something.. but I'd rather see my food..

AJ I.,"Spring Valley, CA",177,111,37,4.0,6/17/2011,"This place is definitely great dinner and dessert place. Although I've failed to leave room for desert almost everytime. First off, their brown bread is addicting. You will get full from munching on it.  Their specialties are great. Their orange chicken is pretty good. Fried macaroni and cheese is a sin. The meatloaf is also good.. Now lets get to the good stuff.. the cheesecakes! they are pretty pricey but they are also rich and heavy. You'll probably regret eating a whole slice on your own. It'll put you in a coma. My favorites are the red velvet and dulce de leche. And you can't go wrong with the chocolate ones!

We ordered appetizers those arrived at the same time as our main meal which was also when we found out that they ran out of the spinach dip after we had talked to the manager the server was really skiddish towards us it took her forever to do anything she dropped off our check and then when we had a question about it she sent someone else over to us end result was we talked to the other manager she apologized to us about our experience our bill was $116.00 and we got shitty service!!!

Eliza C.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",27,5,7,3.0,7/30/2017,"Dirty utensils )):  I've been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for years now and I've always had a great experience. Their employees are friendly, the food is great, wait times are reasonable, and it's the perfect place for all types of occasions. However, I was really turned off today by their dirty utensils. My family and I came for Sunday brunch at around 11 a.m. and only waited about 15 minutes, which is really great for brunch. When our hostess brought us to our table, it had yet been cleaned nor set. We had to wait another 10 minutes until we were seated. We easily excused that small fumble as our hostess was very friendly and had a great sense of urgency. She apologized to us and even helped clean the table herself.  Before we shuffled into our booth, we noticed that the seats were not entirely cleaned off. There was left some sort of grease stain that we had to awkwardly bring notice to to an employee. Not only were the seats still dirty, but so were our utensils. I first noticed a brown smudge on my fork that I honestly was just going to wipe off with my napkin, but then I noticed that all of our utensils on the table had crusted food on it. We then had to, again, awkwardly tell an employee that they gave us dirty utensils.  The second round of utensils they brought out to us were definitely cleaner than the first, but they still had unsightly white marks on them. We didn't complain, we just decided to wipe them ourselves. Fortunately, not long after, another person came by and brought us very clean utensils that were shiny and warm, probably freshly cleaned. We were pleased with their helpfulness but the switching of utensils twice got very annoying.  As always, Cheesecake Factory is a fine place. I most likely will continue to eat here. I just really hope something is done about their dirty dishes. It can easily turn someone off to this restaurant. Not gonna lie, we were contemplating on going to another restaurant because of it. So please, be sure your dishes are clean before served!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=40

Not sure why we planned a last minute birthday party here... we didn't think it would be packed at 2pm on a Sunday but it was. Consequently, it was noisy and hard to visit with tablemates. Based on yelp reviews we opted to order one of the popular dishes call bang bang chicken and shrimp. This was a miss for both of us as half the plate was rice and the meal was too sweet. Where was the spice? You couldn't even recognize any shrimp. Another miss was the garlic noodles with shrimp. We asked our waitress if the shrimp were supposed to look like they did...especially compared to another person's jumbo shrimp on angel hair (that was a hit). The waitress had to go get the manager who told me she didn't understand why on the garlic noodles they chopped the shrimp up here and there. Especially noticeable as it is priced higher than the angel hair with which has beautiful jumbo shrimp!  Am I being too picky to complain about this when the meal is 20 bucks? No, it's 20 bucks! That's not cheap. And I don't think these shrimp are the expensive ones from Mexico either...probably the $7 per pound from Indonesia. Niece enjoyed her eggplant parmesan. Mom enjoyed her veggie burger but not the bread that came with it. Nephew's pasta was tiny. Dad's burrito was huge but filled with a couple pounds of rice! Another in our party thoroughly enjoyed her fried shrimp platter that came with jumbo fried shrimp. Their food is all over the map.

Fastforwarding 20 minutes later, our food arrived, but the waiter didn't acknowledge us that the kitchen was running slow.  He didn't check on us if we needed anything else, didn't refill our beverages, didn't pick up at least one of our empty plates, and didn't tell us another waiter was going to take over.  I even over heard the other table behind me that the customer service was poor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=40

Kamry F.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,7,2.0,8/6/2017,"I would have given this one star if it wasn't for the host/hostesses and the great tasting food...  The host/hostesses were very polite, easy to talk to, and extremely attentive. The ambience is very nice, it gives you a more fancy type of feel, but in a family setting. I went in the middle of the afternoon on a work day, so the place was pretty empty. That being said, you would think it would be nice and clean. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The host sat us down in the booths in the back where the dome is. Every table around us has dirty dishes and FLIES. There were flies everywhere! Only reason I stayed was because my friend date was really craving the BangBang dish.  Our waiter didn't tend to us until 5 minutes after we got sat. Now, I work in restaurants - as a server, hostess, and manager. In every restaurant I worked, and even this location (my friends work here), you are supposed to stick to the 30 second rule. You have 30 seconds to tend to your table after they got sat to run them any drinks so they can drink while they browse the menu. Our waiter, instead, was hanging around the bar talking to his co-workers. When he finally came up to us, we said we were still browsing then he said ""alright then."" And walked away. He didn't take the time to get our drink orders (and we just wanted water), nor did he wait to answer my question. We had to wave him down for him to return. When he did, we asked for our waters and I asked if he could see if the kitchen could substitute my rice for quinoa. He told me he would check, but he did it with a slight attitude.  He came back about 10 minutes later with our waters, one was supposed to be with lemon, the other without. Just shows he wasn't paying attention... He tells me that he would be able to substitute, but for an up-charge. I said that was fine. We ordered two BangBangs, mine was supposed to be substituted with quinoa. When it came out, it was just brown rice. Instead of complaining, since the food was already made, I just told him I would keep it, but to not charge me for it. That was the last time I saw our waiter our entire visit. Ran out of water, no refills. I had to get up and ask, then get up again and ask for the box and check. I gave a $2 tip. I felt rude, but at least I gave something for the poor service (because I do understand that some places require you to tip out bussers, and I know he wasn't going to do any cleaning...)  Come to find out, his one other table was very unsatisfied as well. Cheesecake, I don't know how you choose people during your hiring process, or how/if you do orientations and training, but this man shouldn't be a server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=40
Andy R.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,15,4,5.0,4/29/2017,". Thai Coconut Lime Chicken. Mmmmmmmmm x100. This was the first time I noticed this on the menu. I dine here 3 to 4 times a year and usually order my favorite Louisiana Chicken Pasta. This time I tried something different.  . I was amazed at the infusion of flavors this dish splashed my taste buds with. From eating through the piping hot chicken chunks then the mildly spicy coconut curry sauce and mushrooms and onions and ending with the chilled mango chunks in every bite, its hot, mildly-spicy, cold mixture provided a delightful foodgasmic experience. My mind was never this busy tasting each ingredient this dish had in every bite.  . I highly recommend this dish. Update: 7/22/2017 I ordered this dish last Wednesday. They added cashew nuts and the mango cubes were not served chilled.

My friends and I came here for our Friendsgiving. We were seated immediately upon arrival. SERVICE: Out of all The Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to, this one has the best service! All of our food came out within 20 min, which was surprising to me because I recall having to wait much longer than that at the Mission Valley and Downtown locations. And given that the restaurant was fairly busy at the time we were here, I thought that was impressive! Our waitress was very friendly, fun to talk to, and attentive! She recommended us some items on the cheesecake menu and would occasionally come by to refill our water and bread. She also came by to ask if we were satisfied with our food.  FOOD: I decided to try some menu items I haven't tried before. Here's what I tried: 1) Loaded tater tots: All hail the potato! Any foods with potato, I'm there. These loaded potato tots were amazing, especially with the sour cream and sriracha dip that came with it. I'm still thinking about these as I type. I'm tempted to order some for to-go tomorrow.  2) Chicken pasta: The pasta and marinara sauce ratio was spot on. The pasta was well done, and the marinara sauce was very tasty. The chicken pieces were a little dry, though.  3) Pumpkin cheesecake: I always expect nothing but good things when it comes to The Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes. I enjoyed this -- it was creamy, was not overly sweet, and had enough pumpkin flavor.   RECOMMEND? Yes :) Nice location, good parking lot, great staff, overall good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=40

Christina H.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,2,1.0,8/26/2017,"We go to cheesecake because everything is always pretty consistent no matter which location.  Not the case for us last night. We waited over 45 minutes for any food to arrive at the table. The server said the kitchen ""lost the ticket"" the manager said the kitchen was ""backed up"". I'm sure the server just forgot to put the order in as all other tables around us who sat after us received their meals. I've been restaurant trainer and manager for over 10 years, so I know what that looks and sounds like. What was worse, the manager didn't even apologize he came up to say he was aware the food was taking long and offered us a calamari that had completely died under the line. I know because I saw a runner try to serve it 25 minutes earlier. The sauces, the plate and the lemon wedge were extremely hot... really nice gesture send out old food that was dead anyway to a couple with a 10 month old who have now been seated an hour without food. The sever completely ignored us instead of being more present and apologizing. We didn't need to be lied to, just acknowledged that our meal was ruined.  Just to put it into perspective how ignored our sever left us, he was taking an order next to us when we just decided to box the food since it still hadn't arrived. We agreed just to leave if he turned the other direction instead of coming up to as. And we did because he went out of his way to avoid us.  I've never ever ever left a restaurant like that before. In fact, I don't eve yelp other restaurants because I'm in the industry and I prefer to email or call but this situation left me so angry, starved for food and actual hospitality I do feel compelled to warn others.  We went to in and out and enjoyed the service and the food much better. That's my suggestion to others want consistency and hospitality!  Will not return to any location after this. We have options when it comes to dining out... money should be spent on places that care.  Last piece, the other manager was so completely unaware of our situation that she actually thanked us on the way out!! Clueless. Please retrain your team.

We asked for water several times before receiving it. We even had to ask for the complimentary bread that she never offered. Then when it came she only brought pumpernickel. She said she would be right out with some sourdough that was still in the oven. We never got it. We asked for it later again because I wanted it with my entree and even then she never brought any. This is very disappointing coming from The Cheesecake Factory. We love coming here and have never received anything less than excellent service before.  Also, some tables were moved for a large party and there was a mess where a table once was. We watched the MANAGER and several other team members walked by it multiple times and nobody ever bothered to sweep the mess up. I can't believe that any of this behavior is acceptable any time.

Elize A.,"San Diego, CA",447,128,222,4.0,6/19/2015,"You won't have trouble finding parking, their parking lot is big. I try to avoid Cheesecake Factory during dinner time because it can get really busy. We only waited about 5 minutes during a Thursday afternoon around 2:30 PM. They have lunch specials until 5 PM that consists of ""lunch sized"" portions which I prefer because their dinner portions are always huge!  Our customer service was great and it was because of our waitress Jocelynn! I always had my water refilled, helped with what to order, and she always gave us bread. It wasn't fresh until the 3rd batch of bread she gave us, but it was still good. Who can say no to free bread? Get the whole wheat bread it's delish! (We had 3 rounds of it)  The food takes a little longer than most restaurants, even though it wasn't busy at all. It was the only downfall, however the free bread makes up for it. The food I got the skinnylicious grilled turkey burger, it was good and the portion was perfect; not too big not too small. The taste was also good I loved how it had grilled onions and mushrooms. It also comes with a green salad instead of French fries or any other unhealthy side which I loved! The green salad had a nice flavorful dressing and tasted fresh. I didn't even know about their new Skinnylicious menu until now, thank you Cheesecake! I tried sticking to my diet with their skinnylicious menu however we did order the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake for dessert. It was too sweet for me, so I just had a bite. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=80

Misa A.,"Imperial Beach, CA",280,66,450,5.0,2/15/2016,"For the past 4 years, valentine's day at the cheesecake factory has been me and my hubbys tradition.  We came here for Valentine's dinner tonight around 6:00pm. We found parking pretty fast in the lot and then put our names down. They told us the wait was around 30 minutes so we decided to wait in our car because we have a little 16 month old crazy child. Weeell we ended up waiting for only 13 minutes!!!!! (HUGE TIP: We took our beeper all the way to our car cause there were no seats left and it still worked!!!!) On to the restauranting part!! We walked in, gave them our beeper and we were sat down immediately. Our  server was named Chris and he was sooooooooooooo nice!!! What really made me like him was he brought out a small plate of bananas for my daughter when he brought out the bread for us and I didn't even have to ask him for it!!!!!!!! I have never experienced such a nice yet simple gesture ever before at any restaurant ever!!!!!! I wish I could rate their customer service because it was impeccable. Soooo the food!!! We ordered buffalo blast appetizers which were amazinnnng. I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken and my hubby ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and our baby girl wasn't too hungry after all the bananas, bread and buffalo blasts so we ordered her some french fries and shared our noodles. The food was sooooooooooooo good!!! I love their pastas I have never ever had a bad pasta dish there. We were soooo stuffed that we had to order our red velvet cheesecake to go. And after all the food we ordered our bill came out to only 63 dollars!!!!! I can't wait to go back and enjoy more pasta and cheesecakes :) Definitely my favorite location out of all the others in SD!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=80
Sakae G.,"San Diego, CA",6,42,47,2.0,4/6/2017,"Goodness, I really wonder why I keep coming back here, when I'm let down every time. Oh, right, I have a few gift cards I don't want to waste. I think I'll go up to the Fashion Valley location to finish those off, because the Eastlake one has some issues. They used to be good and I used to love coming here, but the quality is going down big time. This is going to be a long one.  Before I talk about tonight, here is a summary of the last three times I've come here: 1) Med-well Hibachi Steak I ordered came raw/under-rare in the middle. Was dining with a chef friend who warned me not to eat it when I showed it to her. Had to have it corrected. 2) A friend and I both got food poisoning from either the Factory Nachos or the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes that we shared. 3) My Herb-Crusted Salmon came raw in the middle; the middle was a darker orange and semi-transparent. I noticed it when I took a bite in the dim restaurant lighting and the salmon felt like mushy sashimi in my mouth, so I used my phone light to look at it and discovered the raw middle. Gordon Ramsey would have slapped his hand on that ""RAW!"" salmon and made it explode if any of his chefs tried to serve that. (Note: In cases 1 & 3 a manager had my meal remade, but something is wrong at the core here if they keep messing up like this) TONIGHT: I'll try to keep this brief-ish: Fried Mac&Cheese appetizer was refrigerator cold in the middle of one of the balls, and the other 3 were just barely warm. The only tasty part of them was the breadcrumb crust and the marinara sauce they were served on top of. My entree--Hibachi Steak med-well again--was thankfully served med. But the potatoes were cold and the ""tempura asparagus"" was just the 1.5"" chunks of fried stalk and a few chunks of empty fried batter. My dining companion ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, and guess what? You'll never guess. Ready? It was cold too! The shrimp was cooked to the point of being little rubber discs, the rice was hard and cold as if it had sat out for hours before being put on her plate in a cup-shaped flat-topped mound. She said the black beans tasted like they'd been poured straight out of a can onto her plate. But! The 3 plantain slices that came on with her meal were great and hot and we ate those dipped in the black pepper sauce, which was spicy and tasty as well. A little on the sweet side, but still good. I had a few bites of the Banana Cream Cheesecake I got to take home, and that was really good! (But I'm pretty sure that wasn't made here and was shipped in) For this much money ($75 tonight) I expect my food to be hot, fully cooked, and taste good. This Cheesecake Factory location keeps failing on all three counts. Also: Restrooms were dirty with tp in only 2 of 5 stalls, and the menus and salt/pepper shakers were coated in food smears and grime.

Tiffany J.,"Las Vegas, NV",228,121,39,2.0,7/20/2016,"I really don't like posting mediocre or even negative reviews. We must've come on an off night. I mean, it's Cheesecake Factory so there's an expectation of pretty decent but not inventive food. And an expectation of decent service as well.  Host stand: looked at my husband like he had 3 heads when we said we had 5 in our party.  We waited a few minutes for them to get a table ready. Followed her to the table, while passing 3 empty 6 top booths....to a booth for 4 where they put a chair at the end. Uncomfortable, but maybe they had cut the server in the section where tables that could actually seat 5 people were.  So they put an extra chair there but not another place setting. Also, our roll ups did not contain butter knives. So we were scraping our bread against the wrapper of the butter, and playing musical napkins. It was fun!   Service: server was in a hurry to get out. Barely spoke. Took our order and bounced.  The food runner dropped our apps down and left. No offer of ground black pepper for the Caesar salad. Maybe I overthought that one and CF isn't classy enough for that, but I swear I've been offered it before. Oh well, pepper shaker it was!  I should also mention that we were not offered share plates for the apps, so either we were using our tiny bread crumb covered plates, or eating directly from the plate itself. Good thing we were all family.  Food: chicken quesadilla was decent but guac was brown. Shirley temple was pink but had zero cherries. Caesar salad was okay but croutons were weirdly soft, like stale ciabatta bread that they didn't take time to toast. Carbonara was decent, but I find it strange that it was a white creamy sauce similar to Alfredo. Usually the carbonara I get at Italian restaurants doesn't have cream, or barely any, and the sauce is made with bacon grease/oil, pasta water and egg yolks. I could be wrong, or maybe this is just CF recipe.  The kicker:  the French dip. What a train wreck. I've never had a French dip that didn't come with, well, dip. Au jus. This was basically a roast beef sandwich on a hamburger bun. Yes, hamburger bun, complete with sesame seeds. Huh? I guess I was expecting a nice baguette and au jus to accompany. Again, maybe it's CF flair?  Well, it sucked. And the best part was, upon inspection, there were two corn kernels in it. If there was a bunch of corn in it, it would've made more sense. It would have been strange, but it wouldn't have creeped me out like two random corn kernels.  First world problems, yes. But when I'm spending $95 plus tip for dinner, I guess I expected a normal Cheesecake Factory experience. We still tipped $20 because we aren't a-holes, but seriously. Either this was a really off night, or it was the nonchalant B team working. They didn't even try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=80
Bernadette S.,"Chula Vista, CA",366,23,48,1.0,1/16/2017,"I've never given 1-star and unfortunately this was not the first time I've experienced the lack of service and attention from a restaurant of this caliber. We brought our clients to celebrate and reserved some of our comment to avoid our clients from feeling uncomfortable. Firstly, we transitioned between 5 servers within our first 10 minutes all while were confused and none could remember what we asked for. The following occurred during our dining experience my main frustration is my co worker and I split a LUAU salad which I requested with one of the 5 servers. The server that was on break came back with a full plate and I specifically asked the salad to be split into 2 bowls. The server proceeded to ""argue"" with me insisting this is against policy which is not true because another Cheesecake Factory graciously worked on this simple request of splitting a salad. Here is what else happened during our dining experience : 1) Rarely checked up on us several times my drink was empty and didn't ask if we could us refills 2) never offered hot water refills for our clients ""paid tea"" 3) Brought cheesecake with NO UTENSILS 4) We asked for more pumpernickel bread and it never came  5) We asked for straws and honey and no one came back with this simple request  6) Our dishes were not taken away when the cheesecake came out and clearly our plates were cleaned up and packed away. This by far has been one of the worst dining experiences to date since I've been living in the community since 2008. We dine our frequently and I now will choose to go to neighboring restaurants with better service. I've had another negative experience here but let's hold off on that story I believe I've made my point.

We ended up leaving because that would not have been a pleasant dining experience. After that, I ordered take out a couple times. But when I got it home, the order was completely wrong.

I was disappointed that they would serve it so burned on the bottom maybe since it was a to go order they though eh...they can't say anything about it. But I had to. I still ate it cuz I was hungry but each bite ended with that burnt taste. The 4 stars really is for the customer service I received on the phone and for having vegan options. Maybe consider a vegan cheesecake slice you can call it non dairy or whatever for your meat eating customers not to be afraid of it but it'd be a good idea. Honestly I haven't eaten here in like 2 years because of the options were limited. But it was a coworkers lunch so I'm glad I tried it again.

I tell the server I'm upset regarding the amount of avacado. I get half of what was provided but in small little chunks the second time. The side of tomato I got was not even ripe.

Gaige H.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/15/2017,"Usually Cheesecake Factory is our go to during the week, we sit outside they accomodate our kids and usually even if the food and drinks take forever the server is generally really sincere and likeable. Today was definitely a different experience. We were greeted by the manager and my wife who works at a fine dining restaurant had a good interaction with him, unfortunately our server was not the same. We were greeted a little harshly, considering there was two other tables on the patio and the inside was dead for a lunch time so our server didn't need to be so stressed out and grumpy. Gave him immediately our kids order and drink order and appetizer order. I had also asked for waters but after three different table touches (each time he would bring out different drinks instead of prioritizing and bringing everything together we would have rather waited a little longer then two drinks here then a few minutes later another drink and then the waters after that). About 15 go by we receive our kids food,  with no sign of the appetizer we ordered at the same time. Probably 20-25 minutes in he comes by and says our food will be out shortly and we ask to cancel the appetizer since it's been over 30 minutes. What's the point of asking for a starter if it comes with the meal especially since we ordered it 15 minutes before we ordered our meal. Ten more minutes go by, we get our meals and I had noticed the chicken was dressed in vinegrette when I asked for no vinegrette, but they were good. But server didn't do a check back and only brought our stuff because the hostess couldn't get a to go box.

Ordered crab bites for starters; they were exactly that bights worth, true as stated in the menu;quality ingredients as best as I can tell. Entrees were good, however my other half's Carbonara was not as rich as other places, and my Fish and Chips was made of quality ingredients however the portion size was not nearly as large as what I've received elsewhere. Dessert was excellent, and super rich. What else would one expect with cheesecake being in the name. So good, that we couldn't finish because they were overwhelming in their denseness of flavor.

I would think the opening at 11:00 would boost their food sales. Not pleased with having to wait outside the door for 1/2 hour with 20 other people!!!! Otherwise nice place to eat and good service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=100

Say this is not correct, so I can continue supporting your location, otherwise, you just lost another regular customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-chula-vista-2?start=100
