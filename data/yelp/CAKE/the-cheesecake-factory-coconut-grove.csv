Diana L.,"North Miami, FL",175,287,619,4.0,2/11/2017,"These place never disappoints on food no matter what location you go to, the food always tastes delish. I got the lettuce tacos and they were pretty good and healthy. I also got to try a little bit of everyone else's food. The pasta is the best in this place! It's so greasy and delicious! And full of flavors. The flat breads were good, as well.  We went in a hurry since we had a movie to catch at 8, so we asked the waiter to let us know what cooks quick and will be ready fast since we only had an hour. He told us anything fried and pasta lol, well so we ordered just that. He offered really good service and was quick, which we needed at that moment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove
Jo Jo C.,"Markham, Canada",48,211,178,4.0,1/10/2017,"We were visiting and ended up stumbling upon cheesecake factory as we vised coconut grove area. This was on the second floor of a building. There isn't Cheecake Factory in Toronto, where our group was from, so we did enjoy being able to eat here. The food are in huge portions. Just like all places in the states... The food was enjoyable and we like everything that we ordered. From the salad to the pasta, and pizza. Everything came out accordingly. We were a large group with approximately 10 including kids and we were still being taken care of to quite an extent I will be back if we visit again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove
Heather S.,"Miami, FL",98,77,324,4.0,5/20/2016,"Came here as a birthday dinner celebration for my mom. And on a Friday night of all times when everyone seems to be prowling the streets to do something exciting to kick off the weekend. Arrived close to 7 o'clock and our party of 5 was seated pretty quickly. Surprisingly, they weren't too busy at this time on a Friday, which was great for us since we didn't have to wait long to get a table. :)  Now, for those of you who have never been here before, their portions are pretty big. Don't fill up on the complimentary beard if you want to finish your meal. They certainly don't want you to go home hungry so definitely come on an empty stomach!  Luckily for me, I was practically starving by the time we made it to the restaurant and though I was slowly being seduced by the bread that was wickedly trying to get me to eat it, I held on strong! That was until the appetizers came and, needless to say, there went that notion. My sister was really craving the nachos so we started with that and got some pot stickers to start off the night. Our waiter was more than friendly, he certainly had some quick wit going on with some of our outrageous questions that seemed to have gotten asked. He didn't miss a beat. I am now convinced he is definitely a Jedi and really does meet up with Yoda out in the Everglades. =D Totally cool by my standards!  Also, one must have cheesecake when they go to the Cheesecake Factory! I mean, it's in their freakin' name for crying out loud!! :) The dessert menu is full with all sorts of tasty goodies that I'm sure will have you wishing you could have one of each. If you're not a fan of cheesecake, not to worry, they have regular cake too to satisfy that sweet tooth of yours. :P **Just a side note, parking can be a bit of a hassle, you can opt for the street or find a garage nearby. Either way, you're probably not going to find front row parking, especially if it's a Friday night, so do expect to do a bit of walking to get to your destination. It's not as bad as it seems though, you at least get to take in a bit of Coconut Grove on your journey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove
Sabryna L.,"Miami, FL",57,321,487,3.0,4/29/2017,"I wanted to give Cheesecake factory another chance since my boyfriend absolutely loves this place. I changed my mindset to specifically order non-healthy meals, since I find that they do not have good options for healthy meals. As an appetizer, I ordered the Korean Fried Cauliflower. Though it may seem healthy, it probably wasn't because it was delicious. I think the menu said 1,000 calories - wow... It wasn't filling at all as an appetizer, but I would definitely order it again. My main entree was the fettuccine alfredo. I remember it tasting differently from my pre-yelp younger years. Of course when the waiter comes, I make him put an entire mountain of cheese on the serving for me. But by the time the cheese is gone, I noticed there wasn't any real flavor to the alfredo sauce. While pasta most likely always tastes delicious, this one started tasting a little bland towards the end. In my very many trips here, this is a reoccuring issue. I wish I could say I found my go-to dish here, but sadly it hasn't happened yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove
Lynsey H.,"London, United Kingdom",201,439,2582,5.0,11/12/2015,"Although I may not admit it to my American friends (I'm a Brit), I LOVE it here! Our server (Xindi?) was really nice and constantly refilled our drinks when we were running low and the food came out really quick and it was delicious!  Firstly, the sweet brown bread from the complimentary bread basket is devine! I ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich (one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!) and my husband ordered the taco salad. My sandwich had the perfect combination of ingredients and flavor to make it amazing!!  It was sooo good!! I love that you have marinara sauce to dip your sandwich in. My husbands salad was so large, he loved it.  We of course couldn't leave without cheesecake. We shared 1 slice of the salted caramel cheesecake, which I have to say, was AMAZING. The best flavor I have tried at Cheesecake Factory and it had a thick biscuit crust/base that I loved.  All round it was a fabulous experience, the food was great and our server was really great. We came away happy customers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove
Vanessa K.,"Miami, FL",0,40,29,1.0,4/1/2017,"Ordered delivery via door dash. Food arrived 35 minutes late and cold.  We ordered the Mac and cheese balls which were good.

Zeina T.,"Miami, FL",35,3,,1.0,11/3/2016,"Wow! I never take the time to write a review, but this was a really bad experience. How disappointing! I usually love the food there, but the staff at this location specifically is soooooo unprofessional including management.  I walk in to dine at the bar after a long day at work thinking it's one of favorite spots to eat, and nothing can go wrong. At 1st, I stood by the bar waiting for the bartender Desiree to finish texting. I waited and waited and she wouldn't turn around and never even realized I was there. So I had to interrupt her texting, and finally placed my order which I already knew without needing a menu, being a regular customer. My cellphone had run out of battery, and I needed to turn it on and use it to request Uber once I'm done. So I asked her if she could get it charged. She said that the charger is available but not for guests needs. I asked for the manager on duty and asked what this meant. The manager Nina who took long to see me said that the bartender had her personal phone charger and is free to choose whether to let me use it or not. 1st, the bartender shouldn't be on her personal phone to begin with ignoring me while I'm waiting for service. And 2nd , no one is supposed to be more important than the customer.  I ended up just walking out immediately and going to another restaurant. I will only go to Dadeland location from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove
Michele L.,"Miami, FL",33,155,,1.0,3/28/2016,"The resto was about half full but we were seated at the end table at the kitchen.  When we asked for another seating, the hostess rolled her eyes at us. We sat overlooking the street and the window sills were filthy with dust and food as was the floor. An single old fashioned was $12.  The dynamite shrimp was a greasy tempura with a few tablespoons of what tasted liked a paprika ranch dressing.  The favorite meatloaf was salty; dry and burnt at the edges.  The mushroom gravy tasted packaged with one single piece of mushroom.  The mashed red potatoes and succotash were good enough but tasted like diner food. Very disappointing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove
Violet P.,"Edmonton, Canada",109,952,429,4.0,11/9/2014,"This location is in the Cocowalk area and was just 2 minutes away from our hotel.  It was a weekday evening and not busy around 6PM so we were shown to a table promptly. I'm familiar with this chain but had never eaten there before so it took a while to go through the menu.  There is a lot of items to choose from the appetizers to mains, and I wanted to save room for cheesecake!  Our server was attentive to check if we had questions about the menu and if we were ready to order.  She said portion sizes were big so that helped me decide what to have.  I had the tex mex egg rolls which were an appetizer but was enough for a meal.  There were so many flavours of cheesecake to choose from but I picked the tiramisu one.  The piece wasn't too big and rich to enjoy after my meal but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  I enjoyed it with a cup of tea. I liked the food and service.  Would be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove
Charlie S.,"Miami, FL",30,268,,3.0,11/17/2015,"It's always a little funny to review a chain restaurant, I think. Especially one as ubiquitous as The Cheesecake Factory. Nonetheless, here we go:  The location in Coconut Grove is a perfectly average spot. You get exactly what you expect out of the Cheesecake Factory. Big menu with diverse selections, big portions.  I got the the spicy crispy chicken sandwich and, from my read of the menu, thought it would be like a buffalo chicken sandwich. Not so. The coating on the chicken sort of has the spicy sauce cooked in, as opposed to poured on or being tossed in. So as served this was dry, not spicy enough, and a bit underwhelming.  I asked for extra hot sauce and blue cheese dressing which I added myself. And it turned out that the sandwich was pretty good with the additions.  My sweet potato fries were average. Little to say here. Perhaps slightly too crisp/dry for my taste.   Service was (you guessed it) pretty average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove
Jeff G.,"Edmonton, Canada",41,214,117,4.0,11/16/2014,"The selection is wide and the portions are huge. Pastas, burgers, steaks, fish & seafood, pizza, etc. I ordered the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich with spicy Buffalo sauce. (HOT!!!) It came with French Fries on the side. I should've ordered a bucket of ice too. Did I mention it was hot? I got the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake™ for dessert. Another large portion. I could barely finish the cheesecake because the servings were so big. The food was awesome. It was a quiet weeknight when my wife and I went there so it was a laidback intimate evening. Our server was very nice, polite, and soft-spoken. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and glad to answer all the questions we had. It took us a while to decide what we wanted because the menu was so expansive but she was patient with us. The restaurant plays loungy, soft jazz music which adds to the tranquil atmosphere. Not my cup of tea but it seemed to fit for the evening. If we're in Miami again, we'll definitely revisit this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove
Moraine S.,"Miami, FL",80,74,187,3.0,8/20/2016,"I came here Tuesday evening with my fiance for a quick late night dinner. I love the atmosphere and the location of this restaurant. I am particularly used to the location at Aventura Mall since it is closer to my home. Our waitress took our order and brought our food out, which did take some time but I wasn't too picky about that. The food quality could have been better. I don't know if it was due to the fact that they were about to close in about an hour but I order the Shrimp Sandwich along with the Macaroni Cheese Balls. My fries were cold like they were sitting there for days. The fries tasted stale and cold. The waitress was going to take the fries back and get me a fresh batch but I was already full and did see it fit for them to make some more fries if I wasn't going to eat it. Overall the experience was not too bad but the food needs some more improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove
Ute L.,"Denver, CO",434,865,1196,3.0,1/17/2015,"Just to be clear- someone gave me a CF gift card, otherwise you would not find me in this establishment. I came prepared, having studied their online nutrition guide. It would be fun to play a guess-how-many-calories trivia game here, as one of their salads clocks in at over 1,500 calories, and some of the fruity cheesecakes (wild blueberry for one) actually score higher on the calorie scale than the chocolatey ones.  They were busy on Saturday at 1:00 pm prime time, so I planted myself at the bar. The food came out incredibly fast and all the staff was very pleasant and friendly.  Since I already knew I was going to order a slice of cheesecake, I got the healthiest salad on the menu: Seared tuna with greens, avocado and tomato. I asked for lightly dressed greens, and they still came out more saturated than I like. The salad was good but nowhere near worth $18.  Oreo Dream Cheesecake... Layers of crushed Oreos, dark chocolate cheesecake, vanilla cheesecake, thick milk chocolate icing and Oreo crumbles. Incredibly rich and fatty. Not too sweet. I took my time eating it, even though the guys next to me seemed to get some weird satisfaction out of watching me.  The cake was even better once it came to room temperature. I am literally having heart palpitations now, as my body isn't used to this rich food. 880 calories, BTW - in case you were wondering.

The Gringa ..,"Miami, FL",0,12,,1.0,8/22/2016,"I went to lunch with my boyfriend this past Friday at the Cheesecake Factory in Coconut Grove. I had heard many great things about the Cheesecake Factory and wanted to try it myself. This was the biggest mistake EVER!!! Our server was excellent and took the time to go over many things on the menu that I had questions about. It took me about 20 minutes to decide what I wanted because the menu is full of so many options. We ordered the fried Mac N' Cheese balls as our appetizer. They were delicious and something I've never tried before. Then I ordered a salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes, a pretty healthy choice, right? I was hospitalized later that evening because the salmon contained bacteria. 4 days later, I was finally released from the hospital.

Naty K.,"Miami Beach, FL",282,1043,10006,4.0,4/6/2015,"I like Cheesecake Factory because the menu is so varied that it's impossible not to find something you like.  Plus, the food is tasty, and even if you don't get their cheesecake, you can drool over them and the amazing ingredient combinations staring back at you from behind the glass, and just dream...  Whether you want salads, pasta, seafood, or steak, they're here to please.  Even better, they now have a low calorie menu called the ""Skinnylicious"", so even the more health-conscious people can find something they like.  There's also a kids' menu, which has pretty affordable kid-approved options for even the most finicky kid.   I ordered a Skinnnylicious Fresh Vegetable Salad, and was thrilled by the variation of vegetables in it.  I don't think I have seen a salad with so many ingredients before: asparagus, green beans, tomato, cucumber, roasted beets, apple, edamame, radicchio, Romaine and white cheddar, with a pomegranate vinaigrette.  I also added chicken.  Sure, it wasn't as ""unbutton your pants because you're going to explode"" filling as their larger, calorie-laden options, but it was still quite satisfying, and with different, refreshing flavors going into your mouth, it was a new experience. I do want to warn you though, that being on Cocowalk, this location can get quite full.  We had a 30 minute wait, and though that normally would have made me give this location 2 or 3 stars, our waiter Kathleen was so great and so patient (we had 3 kids in our party, on a play date, so you can imagine how indecisive and rowdy they can get), that she is the reason I decided to give them a 4.  At one point, I needed to accompany the girls to the restroom, and the waitress was perfectly fine with that.  She made sure they didn't clean our table and rushed me off to go take care of the girls.  If all the waiters are this great, then I definitely stand behind my 4 star rating. It got too late to order cheesecake and kids shouldn't eat sugar late at night or they'll bounce off the walls and never sleep, so we had to skip on the cheesecake, but next time, we already know what we'll be ordering!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=20

Tyonna B.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/6/2016,"I NEVER write Yelp reviews but this was ridiculous. I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory in Miami since I've moved here but I wanted to go for my birthday dinner because it has decent prices & I like the food for the most part but the experience here ALMOST ruined my birthday. This particular location is TERRIBLE. The service was unbelievably slow. We sat down for an hour before we got any of the bread that they serve & we didn't get waters for ANYONE unless we specifically asked. That's stuff that should be given immediately, not an hour later. But whatever. The food was subpar for me (I got the chicken nachos & they weren't even hot by the time they came out). None of the food was served at the same time so you had half the table waiting and the other half waiting an extra 10 minutes before the plates arrived. The service continued to be slow so we asked for the check the SECOND we got our entrees.....still took 30 minutes. The worst part for me was the fact that it was a birthday celebration. They knew it was my birthday because we explicitly told them multiple times. My friend told me at the end of the night that he was pissed because he went to the back and also notified someone that it was my birthday & asked them to sing and give me ice cream....because that's what they do on birthdays & I heard them in the restaurant singing to 2 other different people already. But guess what? It never happened. We had sat there for almost 3 full hours & it was almost 11:00 PM so I decided to forget about it & just told everyone they could go home because it wasn't worth it.

I've been going to cheesecake factory for years and it never disappoints me  but this location was by far one if my worst experiences ever! I'm from Orlando Fl and was on vacation in miami area with friends from California! I decided to take them to cheesecake factory since we all love it! We saw that this location is permanently closing in a couple of days and that should've been a hint to us or at least if should've rang our bell but we didn't pay attention to that! It seems like they just dont care anymore since they are closing! We started with factory nachos when we got our nachos we had a fly on the top enjoying the pico de gallo and sour cream, we noticed as the waitress was putting the plate on the table we told the waitress and we removed the fly ourselves i asked my friends if they wanted to send the plate back (as a matter of facts the waitress didn't offer us to send the plate back nor apologized or even said sorry) we decided to keep it and just removed from the plate all the chips from that area. 2 of us chose the Renee's special=worst decision ever, salad was soggy and even croutons were nasty, when Im about to try my soup my soup spoon was dirty with what looked like dry chocolate, my partner's soup salad was also dirty with what looked like dry cheese by this point we were giving up. By the way when we told the waitress to get clean silverware and showed her how dirty they were she just said ""oh ok i bring you new ones"" not even an ""im sorry"". My friends pasta was horrible, oily and flavorless by this time we just asked for our check and decided to leave!! It has been by far the worst dining experience with careless/inattentive waitress and wasted money! We decided to take our business to a local cuban restaurant instead to have a well deserved dinner and at least we had an awesome experience!

Nydia M.,"Miami, FL",390,647,166,1.0,10/4/2014,"I just visited this Cheesecake Factory location for what I can guarantee will be the final time. After waiting 20 minutes for bread we placed our order. The waitress was very friendly and her smile was very well received after getting the side eye from the hostess when I asked to not be seated in the hot terrace-like area with the big windows.  I ordered a veggie burger with no mayo and received a veggie burger with a side of mayo and traces of mayo in the lettuce and bread.  Looked like they prepared my burger with mayo, remembered that it wasn't supposed to have mayo, wiped some of it off, and them brought it out to me.  No thanks.  The burger was taken back and the manager stopped by to apologize, which was nice. After having been waiting for food for an hour I finally received my second burger. It was room temperature on the outside and cold on the inside. Cold.  Like straight from the fridge cold. I had three bites because it was 2pm at this point and I was insanely hungry, but it was a gross, cold, soggy/uncooked disaster. The goat cheese and beet salad my husband ordered was ok, but I've had the same salad at another cheesecake factory and it was a lot better. My kids grilled cheese had the most amount of butter I've ever seen in a piece of bread and the ""fresh"" fruit salad that came with it was a soggy mess.

Dawn A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,49,5.0,8/2/2015,"Passed the cheesecake factory on our trip in seattle but never got time to go in, so I was determined to visit when i found this one around the corner from our hotel in miami. Am i glad we did!  The hostess seated us straight away, our waiter 'mike' was friendly and helpful.  My husband had a pit beef dip sandwich, i had a cuban sandwich... We went halves and they were both delicious, really, really tasty, never even put a fry past my lips cause i was so full.... I guess it'll have to be another visit for the cheesecake;-) My daughter had the cajun chicken littles... Not little by any means, she loved them.

Mark D.,"Miami, FL",23,259,571,4.0,12/27/2015,"Well I don't normally review the big chains because, basically, you already know them and have drawn your own conclusions. However, I think since employees at one location can really make a difference I am reviewing the Coconut Grove Cheesecake Factory. We were cheerfully greeted and seated immediately. The house manager, Siobhan, was delightful. She checked on us several times to make sure everything was alright. Our server was Marvin. Some adjectives to describe him are attentive, conversant, witty, and professional. These 2 individuals rate 5+ stars. The food this day, however, was somewhat hit and miss, not of the calibre of previous Cheesecake experiences. The Mac'n Cheese balls were great. The artichoke n'crab dip was fantastic. However, they provided an insufficient amount of crackers to dip with. Quick-thinking Marvin brought some fresh warm tortilla chips, but it wasn't quite the same. The DaVinci pasta was good but had a meager amount of chicken. The eggplant parm/pasta, and the garlic smashed potatoes were standard fare good. The Shrimp Scampi was on point awesome, however the accompanying steak Diane was somewhat over cooked, dry and a little tough. I conveyed my thoughts about the food to Siobhan, and she graciously accepted the ""constructive criticism"". Of course the cheesecake, in this case the ""Tuxedo"" was decadently delicious. Overall it was a 3 star food day on this visit but the above and beyond attitudes of Siobhan and Marvin kicked it up to like a 4.25 star experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=20

Seyran C.,"Miami, FL",125,232,130,2.0,10/28/2015,"I usually don't leave reviews for chain restaurants but I feel that Cheesecake Factory lovers should all be aware of some of the pitfalls associated with this restaurant that set it apart from others. First off, it's relatively small. I don't know if it's old, but it feels that way. And due to its proximity to a cinema, it's packed with large, loud families. Let me reiterate: LARGE, LOUD FAMILIES.  Actually, its likely because of this factor alone that service is exceptionally slow, the ambiance isn't as ""date-night-esque"" and the interior feels cramped.  That being said, there's nothing wrong with the food coming out of the kitchen. Same old classics, done consistently with every other Cheesecake Factory we've all likely been to.  My favourite is the Chicken Littles, a mountain of crispy tenders with mashed potato and corn. However, this time, I had El Hub get it while I ventured out into territory I had not yet explored in Cheesecake Factory before: Thai Chicken Lettuce Cups, which were actually delightfully fresh and filling. Moreover, I did not want to run to the bathroom to change into sweatpants immediately following my meal.  What more can I say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=20

Natasha N.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,9,1,1.0,12/30/2014,"I am a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location was a huge let down and waste of money. I also want to mention that I have serving and hosting experience. During each grievance my party was more than polite.  First off, the hostess seated us in back room by the windows, which was disgustingly hot and packed! Everyone looked like packed sardines! She squeezed us at a table where in order to pull my chair out to sit, I had to hit the customers seat behind me. It was so loud I had to yell at my partner sitting across from me! We asked to be seated in the front part of the restaurant where there was plenty of room!! I cannot fathom the rational of trying to seat customers in a noisy, sticky back room when there is ample space in the front of house. There are too many tables in that back room, none of the customers were seated comfortably.  Service was mediocre at best. I ordered a Cobb salad and asked them to replace the bleu cheese with mozzarella. When my salad came out, the lettuce was tired looking and wet. It also had bleu cheese, no mozzarella. The waitress apologized and took it back to the kitchen. When it came back out it had no cheese at all, and no chicken anymore! They clearly just scraped the top portion of the salad off and didn't bother replacing the correct toppings. The kitchen should not be so lazy but our waitress did not even bother checking to make sure the order was correct. I didn't bother sending it back because clearly this staff was incompetent. Once is acceptable but if a customer has to ask you to DO YOUR JOB twice, that's excessive. To date, this was the worst cheesecake experience I have ever had. It is such a shame because it is in a prime location. I rate this restaurant one star because zero is not an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=40

Dr. Mario O. L.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,28,78,4.0,2/8/2016,"Oops I've dropped one of the stars....How could I?   After many years of absence we went with my son Gian Luca to visit this great eatery in one of the most charming little malls of the USA: Coco Walk. We have always had good experiences with the food and staff right from the start. Except yesterday. Mrs. Viviana, the lady that served our table, was apparently in the last half an hour of her shift and took short shrift of our custoner needs. First of all she did not greet us properly to make us feel welcomed. Second she pushed us to order when we were still reviewing a menu we were no longer familar with. Maybe she doesn' t know that the modern concept of a restaurant was born after the French Revolution guillotened thousands of noblemen and left their domestic help unemployed. They went to the Paris city centre to open businesses  with separate tables and a written menu. No more long shared tables and voiced menus for clients like you can see in ""The Prancing Pony"" of ""Lord of the Rings Part I"". Is she still living under the 'Ancien Regime'? Her abuse did not stop there. She did not bring us water or bread right away; she dropped my bottle of beer without pouring some of it as a courtesy. The worst came when we ordered. We have always enjoyed their pasta and seafood dishes with real Parmesan cheese grated over them. We asked for the ""Shrimp and Angel Hair pasta"" with a caveat. Extra shrimp for my son and extra squid for moi.. We were very hungry. ""We don't have that. Shrimp is the only seafood here."" she said grumpily. ""Excuse me,"" I said, ""you do have squid because I saw a dish of 'calamari' in the menu.""  ""Oh, sorry, I don't speak Italian,"" she said, sniggering."" I took a long hard look at her. ""But we do so don't try to BS us!""    After an uncomfortable impassse, Mrs. Siobhan McMahan, the manager, came to our table to sort things out. She explained that they could not sautee the squid so I settled for double Shrimp. We did some small talk and all was well. Fortunately that ogre of a woman finished her shift and a knockout young black girl called Courtney continued serving us. She was everything the other wasn't: polite, attentive and efficient.  When I told her that I was going to Yelp my visit, she smiled.  ""You' d better give me the best qualification or I'll spank you!"" she said.                                                                      ""With a wet towel?""

Mike J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",22,2,5,5.0,10/16/2014,"Visited the Cheesecake Factory in the Grove on Sunday afternoon and had a great experience.  Hard to believe the place has been there for over 20 years and is cleaner and better than the early days.  There was a wait and even though I was with two small kids we were treated kindly and given a table large enough to accommodate us.  We were greeted immediately and I don't remember the gentleman's name but he was friendly and knowledgeable.  We ordered two apps which were tasty and came out quickly and steaming hot!  My four year old loved the mac n cheese balls!  My wife and I each got tacos, which were fresh and delicious.  The only negative thing I can say is that the portions are huge!  Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  We live in Broward and don't get to the Grove often, but I certainly recommend the Cheesecake Factory to anyone going to Coconut Grove.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=60
Carrie R.,"Melbourne, FL",127,84,20,3.0,7/23/2013,"You may have been taken here on a date when you were in high school thinking you had made it into official adulthood and overlooked the gaudy decor because, hey,  you were big time now. But come here as an adult and your kind of wondering why a place called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" is fashioned as though it was erected from ancient ruins.  Any how, the food is a typical hodgepodge of everything and the kitchen sink and the portions are almost certainly not meant for normal consumption during one sitting. So fortunately if you care about your calorie intake there is a ""Skinnylicious"" menu that helps navigate you through what should be a normal serving size (though it will look minuscule if you glance at the indulgent family that is surely stuffing their faces in a booth near by). In a nutshell, service is efficient and the food is predictable- the ""skinnylicious"" menu is not bad- the fiance and I shared a pear and blue cheese flatbread which was pretty delicious, the sweet pear was balanced by the sharp and salty blue cheese. I ordered a turkey and avocado sandwich with a side salad and it was ok, not out of this world but not guilt inducing. My fiance ordered the turkey burger with the same side salad and no complaints were made. Overall it wasn't bad but not enough to make us rush back- we did have a $50 gift certificate so that made it more worth our while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=60

Sergio F.,"Miami, FL",765,1259,5157,4.0,11/15/2010,"I came by last night for a friend's birthday. We had done the Art Walk Saturday and wanted a break from the usual Design District and beach haunts. Besides, the Grove is an old standby and perfect for Sunday going-outs as its not packed.  Seating was a 20 minute wait, which is fairly typical when I go to Cheesecake but at least we had time to walk around window shop. Our waiter found us a cozy inside table (perfect for a birthday dinner). Wine (chardonnay) was cold and crisp, and promptly served.  The brown bread was awesome..I could come here just for the bread!  My dinner consisted of a HUGE portion of a pasta and chicken. The ""tomato"" seemed a mix of fresh tomatoes supplemented with marinara sauce but tasty nonetheless. There could have been chicken pieces but I won't complain too much compared to other restaurants. Where CFS Grove shone in my opinion was in the dessert and service department. Since the portion was too large for a single seating they actually put it in the takeout box for birthday girl and myself! This was a pleasant surprise as most restaurants usually just give you the box and expect for you to pack it yourself. Their 30th Anniversary cheesecake was monumental! I'm not a chocolate fan (yes there are such people) but this one made me a convert with its balance of softness and richness. I also liked the presentation with the candle, sprinkles and writing Happy Birthday with syrup on the plate :) They didn't charge a mandatory tip but I was glad to because the service was awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=80

Oversized portions of just about any type of food that you could imagine wanting.  With so many great restaurants around the area, I get confused when people choose Cheesecake to go to for dinner, but I find myself here every now and then, usually with big groups of friends for a birthday. The plus side is that the menu has just about anything you could want so everyone can always find something.  The downside of this is that you feel like you're reading a novel before ordering and it makes deciding what to get quite the ordeal!  I've always had good experiences here with the waitstaff and they do a good job of working their assembly line. And not going to lie, I LOVE the cheesecake. Cheesecake is by far my favorite dessert, and they do it just as good as the rest! With all the different varieties, it's impossible to pass up.

Natalie P.,"Ann Arbor, MI",290,206,28,2.0,2/26/2012,"Blah blah blah. It's the Cheesecake Factory. Here's what you need to know: Food: exactly like every other Cheesecake Factory. Décor: pretty much the same as every other Cheesecake Factory. Ambiance: family central, noisy. Service: annoying, slow. I could have sworn that at 8 pm on a Saturday we were seated in ""kiddie central."" There were screaming children and their lazy parents everywhere - our table of four twenty-somethings would have really appreciated NOT being seated beside Princess Screams-a-lot. Annoying children aside, our server was a real PITA. His name was Daniel and he drove me crazy. After my drink still hadn't come out 15 minutes later, I flagged him down to let him know. His response? With sass: ""Yeah, I know, my bartender is really backed up right now."" How is that my problem? I think you mean, ""Oh no, I'm so sorry! Let me see how that's coming!"" Magically he ran right over to the computer and my drink was out in 2 minutes - he just clearly forgot to punch it in. Weirdly, after every time someone at our table said ""Thank You"" to him, he would respond with ""Thank You for Coming."" It was EXTREMELY obnoxious, but we made a game of it, and tried to say ""Thank You"" to him as many times as humanly possible. It was pretty nice payback for his incredibly negative attitude. If it weren't for the friends we were with, the manager probably would have gotten a piece of my mind. Anyway, if you hadn't guessed by the two stars and the review to this point, the Cheesecake Factory is not exactly my favorite restaurants and this is DEFINITELY not my favorite Cheesecake location.

They always sit us in the back where the windows are which is the worst place to be. Although it has a nice view, I guess. The waiters always forget about you and it's where they sit the party tables (birthdays and other celebrations). So when the waiters do get there, they usually focus on those tables. On top of that, the service is slow. We never get the good bread. Maybe once it didn't taste like it was sitting around all day. Hurt your gums hard. The food is good. I always have a problem telling the difference between the food at the same chains. So I can only differentiate the service which is bad.

First of all, he was incredibly attentive to our table, even though it was a table of two.  The chef accidentally made the wrong dish for me, and the server just gave it to us, as he would throw it away if we didn't take it.  Free meal for later!  He was incredibly prompt and wonderful at making recommendations. That being said, the food itself wasn't anything to write home about.  The pasta dish was priced at about $25, but it is something you would be able to get elsewhere for much cheaper.  The food is loaded with unnecessary butter, for my taste.  It was a good meal, but definitely wasn't worth the $60 bill for two people. The CHEESECAKE is definitely the reason to come here (as the name might indicate).  I have tried the Oreo Cheesecake (awesome), the Red Velvet Cheesecake (phenomenal) and Peanut Butter Fudge Cup Ripple was awe-inspiring.  I love cheesecake.  It is completely worth the stomach ache that comes from over-indulging in rich foods.  Overall, I would say come here for the cheesecake, but get your food elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=100

Every time asked him about a certain plate his answer would be like ""I don't know because I dont eat Tuna"" or ""I don't eat that either"". Those were his answers. Wow. I wish he would have lied to me. I am very far from being a difficult customer, really... I dont expect the waiters to like everything on the menu or to give me their personal opinion on plates, that's always nice indeed, but at least be ready to give me a little description on what i'm inquiring about. He ended up just bringing the manager to my table who pretty much ended up being our waiter. He was very nice and suggested me something after describing it in detail. Once my food arrived, it was completely different from what me and him had discussed. I was starving, so I just sucked it up and ate it. The manager did come to check on  me, I explained to him my disappointment, he offered and insisted that I get a new plate, the one he had described, but I declined his offer because I was almost done with my food and had a movie to catch. So he said he would take it off my check, although I thanked him and insisted for him to not do that because I ate my food after all, he still did it.

Laure M.,"Paris, France",157,476,201,3.0,4/29/2011,"Went there for dinner last night. The menu is too long, too many options it's too hard to find what to eat :) or it is for me. They give you bread (sourdough and cereal bread). Our waiter was nice, attentive, filled the waters etc... I got the chicken salad sandwich with a green salad and ranch. The sandwich is huge, so the salad on the side is enough, almost unnecessary because it's very small so get the fries if you are hungry. The bread is a thick buttery white toast, toasted in butter (well toasted in butter). It's crispy, it's good but your fingers will get a bit greasy. I liked the roasted almonds in the sandwich. I was hesitating with the chicken quesadilla but I get that everywhere all the time so I opted for the chicken salad sandwich. I think the quesadilla would have been a better choice because it's cheesy!! The sandwich was good though but I don't think I'll get it again. My husband got the fish & chips and was very happy. It is served with fries, coleslaw and tartar sauce. It's big. The fish fingers are very chunky and the batter looked very good. The fries looked crispy and good.  We decided to indulge and share a slice of the original cheesecake. The cheesecake menu is huge, 2 pages, and the slices are massive. However for the original, the size is totally normal and manageable. Overall it was good. Too bad they don't offer outside seatings. Too many options but it's good if you don't know what to eat and are very hungry!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=120

Over the years I've tried just about everything on the menu and it wasn't until I discovered the fried mac and cheese, that made me want to go back. These four little fried balls of cheesy goodness could cure just about any downer. The plate is also covered with a creamy pink pasta sauce.

Paul W.,"Miami, FL",877,1201,548,3.0,6/8/2009,"I came here a few Fridays ago with 3 friends to grab dinner. We arrived and were seated within about 5 or 7 minutes. The waitress took our drink orders and brought a few kinds of breads and butter for us to start on while we chatted away and checked out the menu. The odd thing with the drink order was that it took her about 5 minutes to bring the alcoholic beverages, but the person in our group who only ordered a Diet Coke waited at least another 5 mins. more for her non-alcoholic drink to arrive. Hmmm.  The group I was with wanted to order a few appetizers to share. I did warn them about the size of the entrees, but even then I don't think they truly understood how large the portions really are here. They chowed down on the breads that arrived (which were yummy) and then polished off a plate of calamari and some avocado egg rolls (both of which were tasty), but then HOLLLLY S**t!  Here came their main course dishes and needless to say two of them had to take a box home so they could have the rest of their meals the next day for lunch.  In all, the food was good and everyone was happy with everything they ordered. As has always been the case at the Cheesecake Factory, the portions are too large IMO, and I'd rather pay a bit less and have a manageable sized meal rather than feeling like a stuffed pig because I tried to finish everything, or feeling a bit guilty about wasting so much food at the end. The service on this night was OK, but wasn't great. The drink orders took a while to arrive as I mentioned earlier in my review, but also once the food arrived one of my friends wanted to ask for a condiment for her burger. We waited nearly 10 minutes before we even saw our waitress, and only got her because we saw her at another table and managed to flag her down. It also took us a while to get the check and get out of there when we were ready to go.  As far as price, I had 2 drinks, a sandwich and fries and chipped in for the appetizers and I think my total came to something like $25 + tip so not bad at all. Improve the service and make the portions a bit more managable and I'd happily add a star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=120

Even pungent ingredients like garlic and capers have no flavor at this establishment. And every dish comes loaded with tons of oil or heavy cream or both and still no flavor.

Miami R.,"Miami, FL",116,77,32,3.0,12/5/2010,"I am giving the cheesecake factory a 3 star, because I've had good experiences at many locations. However, this latest visit deserves a 1 star. But, since I don't believe in destroying anyone's rating over one bad experience, they get the 3 star, and again, that's just because, on the whole, collectively, that what they'd deserve. We were in the grove and went for the old stand by of cheesecake factory. it was lunch time and there was no wait, we walked in, the hostess looked up and passed us off to the other host and we were sat right away.  Our server was one of those guys who's been there a while, he wears too much cologne, which I noticed one other time when we were there. He's pretty regular with his routine. He suggested the special, was animated as he did it. He kept up with our refills and the food came out pretty quickly.  From where we were sitting, we could see the host stand and what really got under my skin, was the female hostess. She was constantly, and I mean CONSTANTLY on her cell phone texting. she had it in a drawer and would pull the drawer our and think she was being slick by reading and texting from there. She looked around all the time as not to get busted by a boss but it was the entire time we were there. She was also dressed a little inappropriately. She was a short, semi larger girl, which is absolutely fine (I'm not judging that at all) however, she was wearing jeans that were too tight (you know, someone who should not be wearing the skinny jeans) so, she had that muffin top, and her shirt was too snug and would ride up so you would constantly see black jeans, black top and bright muffin top. Couple that in with the fact that she was on her phone the entire time and it really started to effect my experience there. Since I've eaten there, I just chalk it up to the work pool we have to choose from down here in Miami. So I know cheesecake is better than that. However, if this were someone's first time, it would make for an AWFUL first impression.  Moving on from the hostess. I got a newer dish they were trying that was on a separate menu. Shrimp New Orleans. Let's just say, I hope this one does not end up on the regular menu.  the portion size was ok, but, it's not that great. what made it worse was, the rice was overcooked. I finished the rest of the dish but left a large portion of the rice behind. When the server came by to ask how everything was. I told him to let the kitchen manager know that the rice was overcooked and he might want to have them make a new batch of rice for the rest of the dishes. I told him, I didn't want anymore rice and that I didn't want anything done about my meal, I was just giving them a heads up. He brought me out another plate of the just the rice, but, it was the same overcooked rice I had mentioned lol. So, not I left behind the rice from my main dish, and the entire plate of overcooked rice he brought me.  So, this was not the greatest experience I've had at a cheesecake factory, but, like I said in the beginning, I've had plenty of very good experiences, so this won't stop me from going back. I just hope that the managers catch these details and fix them so that this doesn't become the norm. They've been around too long doing a great job to let these things drag them down. So, to recap: less cologne on the server better fitting clothes on the hostess not having the hostess text while working don't overcook the rice I'll be back again I know, be it the grove or aventura or wherever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-coconut-grove?start=120
