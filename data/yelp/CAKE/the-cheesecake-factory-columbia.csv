Dr. Keenan C.,"Middle River, MD",7,1,,1.0,11/15/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory still placing silverware directly on contaminated tables in Columbia, MD and elsewhere. This policy much be changed immediately. Wiping tables using same rags. Really cheesecake Factory. Caught food poisoning, viral gastroenteritis and acute kidney injury 3 weeks ago. Had to be admitted at ER. My child and a friend also ate and got sick also.  A national boycott and protest is being planned.

Alli F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",5,17,19,5.0,12/22/2016,"We went to Cheesecake Factory for dinner after years of not getting the chance to go! We just moved to Columbia from LA and figured that Cheesecake was around the corner and a safe bet! I have always been preferable to the food, however the service has never been anything extraordinary... until last Thursday night. We went in 15 mins prior to closing, I honestly feel bad for them, I've worked in retail when I was younger and hated those customers, but always had to serve them with a smile.  Well, the Bartender, Sarah went above and beyond. We let her know that we were new to the area and she greeted us with open arms. She gave us some amazing suggestions of places in the area to check out, where to go skiing. I was apologetic throughout the night, she just laughed every time and said it was not a problem at all and she had to be there anyway. She even said it was refreshing to have customers like us. Anyway, Cheesecake Factory use to be my favorite restaurant when I was a kid and this is by far the BEST service I have received over 3 decades!!!  Thanks Sarah! Keep up the great work! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=20
Taiwo S.,"Wheaton-Glenmont, MD",202,9,2,4.0,10/31/2017,"I came here on a Sunday evening with my mom and was able to get seated right away- super impressed. Our waitress was Paige Z and she was very friendly and patient with us as we decided on what we wanted. I typically only order the Louisiana chicken pasta and wanted to try something different but I settled on that since it was familiar. My mom had no idea what she wanted, so we asked Paige what she liked and she recommended the Bang bang chicken and shrimp, so my mom decided to give it a try.  She brought out a bread basket containing only wheat bread (which we requested) and immediately noticed that the bread was burnt. Not slightly overcooked- burnt ( the whole backside of the bread was black couldn't be cut with a knife). Surely the person who burnt the bread knew it was burnt and still decided to place it in a basket, probably hoping we wouldn't notice. We made Paige aware of the burnt bread and she brought us a new basket 10 minutes later.  While trying to cut the bread I noticed that the entire handle of my knife was dirty! I looked at the other silverware on the table and some of the forks were dirty too :(  I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so I asked for a glass of hot water and we soaked the utensils in the water and wiped them off. When the food came, everything looked great. I go to eat my pasta and its cold. It wasn't warm as if it had been sitting on the line for a few minutes, it was COLD. I was so disappointed because I always get this meal and it usually comes out just right. Again, not wanting to make a big deal out of it, I just ate it as is. My mom told me to just eat her food down her and I could just heat mine up and take it for lunch the next day. Her meal was AMAZING (hence the 4 stars despite all that went wrong). It was hot and as delicious as Paige said it would be. I plan on interchanging between the bang bang chicken and the Louisiana pasta from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=20
Kate S.,"Baltimore, MD",91,322,613,3.0,5/18/2016,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. Over the top with portion sizes, menu selection, and prices. We have family that live in the middle of nowhere and they always get so excited when they come to visit. They think this place is like a Michelin Star restaurant...  I like coming here before 5 p.m. because you can order off of the lunch menu (smaller portions and cheaper prices). The lunch menu is limited but there is still plenty to choose from (soup, salads, sandwiches, pasta dishes, factory favorites, etc.).  We came here on a Monday afternoon and the place was practically empty. I was surprised when our food took awhile to come out... it wasn't like it was prime time for dining. When the meals came out, my salad was the last to arrive at the table... 5 minutes after everyone else's orders came out. I usually enjoy the Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad, but the onion straws on top were undercooked and soggy-- not the usual crispy texture. The Falafel Salad contained a generous portion of falafel and the feta cheese and vinaigrette were a very tasty accompaniment. If you like cheesecake, this is definitely the place to get it. So many different flavors to choose from-- if you have room for it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=20
Jedda P.,"Rockville, MD",221,73,78,4.0,6/24/2016,"Got here before the dinner rush hour on a Friday night (~6:00pm) and got a seat right away at the bar. Server (Kumba) was really nice, all smiles and even made recommendations when we got stuck between 2 appetizers/small plates.  Ordered 3 appetizers/small plates (samosas, shrimp and cheesy tots) and loved all of them! I think the shrimp is definitely going to be my go to... Loved the sauce that it came with. I don't know if the service is just overall fast (I don't come here often) or if it's because it wasn't that busy yet... But friends and I were able to eat and chat and still make our movie at 7:30 next door.  Only downside is that happy hour ends at 6pm and not 7...

Charlie G.,"SUITLAND, MD",1,9,,5.0,6/18/2017,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory!  One of my best meals was had the day I was released from the hospital after brain surgery.  I had a taste for salmon, and my brother took me to the Columbia, MD location.  I wish I had taken a picture because my plate was gorgeous.  The Thai Glazed Salmon was a generous portion, perfectly cooked on a bed of brown rice.  I requested the brown rice instead of white.  I also had the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which were outstanding.  But back to the salmon, it was large enough for me to save some for my lunch the next day, and warmed over, it was still the bomb! A neighbor had come to visit me just as I was preparing to heat my plate, and I couldn't wait for that woman to leave so I could eat in peace!  Oh, it was soooo good! My only complaint about CF is the noise level.  You can hardly hear yourself think, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying my meal.   I want to go back today, but it's Father's Day plus a Sunday, and I know any restaurant today is going to be a zoo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=20
M L.,"Clarksburg, MD",0,6,,3.0,10/5/2017,"31st Wedding anniversary and thought it would be nice to take my husband to lunch.  Experience 2   Food 3 From the very beginning the Waiter was great.  But clearly something out of his control was going on in the background. Received our ice tea, but had to track down someone for sugar after a wait that allowed me to even go to the restroom, stand in a line and return to the table.  I got back to the table before the sugar did.   We arrived at 1:40 pm., post lunch rush.  We were served after 2:15 pm.  Food came in two parts.  Sandwiches, then the sweet potato fries.  Food: Veggie burger was good.  This is one of the reasons I go to Cheesecake Factory, different location.  Tomatoes were fresh, pickles were fine.  Lettuce, though moist, looked more like left over bits of shredded lettuce for tacos.  Husband's bacon burger was alright.  He ordered medium well, but he got something that was pink.  Could have sent it back but the afternoon had already been long.  We ordered our lunch.  After a while, Waiter came out and explained that there was a delay of the veggie burger.  His manager was working on it.  Waiter also apologized that the before meal bread had not arrived. He said (this was the third time) that he was still waiting for it to get finished baking.   The manager came out with the sandwiches, apologized and said the fries were on their way.  I did express (soft tones) our frustration at the wait.  He just kind of looked at us.   Shortly there after a member of the kitchen team came out with a lovely servings of sweet potato fries.  They were hot and good.  She was friendly.  She wanted to know if we wanted some of the pre-meal bread when it was done.  We passed.  Did not get any cheesecake.  Had planned on it, but we were pretty much over it.   Overall this was not a great experience.  We made the best of it.  But won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=20
Jackie A.,"Laurel, MD",26,290,,2.0,3/11/2017,"There are certain dishes that allow for creativity and there are others that when you  order them, you anticipate them to be presented in a certain way.  This holds true for shrimp scampi.  I want to taste the garlic, wine, butter, hint of lemon - see the sprinkle of parsley on my  fat, perfectly cooked shrimp.  I want my nose to twitch, as I inhale the buttery, garlic sauce emitting from my pasta.  That's what I expect to see and taste.  What I received was a mound of pasta, with neither garlic nor lemon - perhaps some butter and wine - served with fried shrimp.  Where's the GARLIC.  You just made me a shrimp scampi without garlic and you fried the shrimp, as if served on a seafood platter?  Say it isn't so. I enjoyed my small Greek salad, with it's fresh veggies and zippy vinaigrette, but next time - please use the oregano leaves and toss the woody twig.

Matt S.,"Bethesda, MD",0,1,,5.0,12/23/2017,"I am going through a tough custody battle with my ex and the only time I was being allowed to celebrate Christmas with my daughters was an hour at the Mall in Columbia the day after Christmas.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that the Mall isn't an ideal location for ANYTHING the day after Christmas. But the idea of going there on that day to meet your 3 and 6 year old daughters to celebrate and open up more than 20 gifts, is nothing short of a nightmare.  Thankfully, I came up with the idea of trying to find a restaurant that would reserve a small area in a back corner where we could sit down, open gifts, and enjoy ourselves briefly.  After a few unsuccessful requests to other restaurants, I finally called The Cheesecake Factory and spoke to one of their Managers names Zach (or Zack? I'll refer to him as Z from now on so I don't spell his name wrong haha), and without hesitation he agreed to reserve a place for us.  As luck would have it, Z was also scheduled to be the opening manager that day, and made sure I knew to come directly to him if I ran into any issues.  Now, if anyone has ever been to Cheesecake Factory, they are pretty strict about their reservation policy.  I even called two other CF locations to see if they'd agree to it, and they both said no. Z probably has no idea how much this means to me, or how much better he's making my daughters Christmas, but it's hard to explain how truly grateful I am to find someone that cares more about doing the right thing instead of going by ""policy"" and saying no.  I figured the least I could do is write some reviews to say thank you.  So thanks Z!  You just gave me the best Christmas gift I could ever receive!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=20

I'm surprised that this location has only been rated three stars.. that's unfortunate because that number doesn't reflect my personal experience here. Last week I came for dinner and everything felt the same as it did a few years ago (except they have a ""skinny menu"" now which btw doesn't include pasta dishes).

I like TCF because every time I order an entree here it takes just like the way it did the previous time I ordered. They are consistent.  We were seated right away without a wait (9pm on a Monday, so we didn't expect a wait). There was a reasonable crowd given that this location is right by a major residential development and Columbia Mall. The server was prompt and friendly and did adequate follow-up visits to the table.  I ordered the Southern fried chicken sliders, which are four mini sliders (""mini"" is relative) with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and two sauces on the side (mayo and tangy chipotle ranch). The chicken was cooked well, not overdone, and was flavorful and fresh. The lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and complemented the meal well. The pickles were way too many for the four sliders, so you're in for a treat if you're a pickle fan. The portion size is large enough for one person.  Leave room for dessert! Get the dessert to go and order well enough ahead of time; they're slow in getting the cheesecakes out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=20

E. R.,"Washington, DC",0,7,20,2.0,9/23/2016,"How does The Cheesecake Factory in Columbia, MD run out of Spinach and Cheese dip??? It really bothers me when the customer have to ask for bread at a restaurant where they provide bread for the table. We ordered a few appetizers to share but I have to say that the food here is really inconsistent which to me hurts the Cheesecake Factory brand. Our service was not bad but it he wa not as attentive as he should have been. We had to catch him to ask fir refills even though he walked past a few times. We ordered buffalo blast, crab and artichoke dip, sliders, and fried calamari. Here's the skinny: Sliders - We asked for well done but when received them they were undercooked so we had to send them back. It took quite a while to get them back which we didn't understand but at least they were juicy and cooked well when the second time. Crab & Artichoke Dip - We ordered this in place of the spinach and cheese dip but I was not impressed. It was okay, but needed more cheese and seasoning. It had way too much grease (as seen in the pic) so we had to drain it before eating. Fried Calamari / Buffalo Blast - Great, nice crisp coating and seasoned well.

Amy K.,"Elkridge, MD",96,31,27,1.0,6/9/2017,So Cheesecake Factory is notorious for their waits. That j can deal with but what is absolutely unacceptable is getting splinter in your dish. My boyfriend was eating his dinner and had to take a splinter out of his mouth!!! What's even more infuriating is the managers response. He just offered to remake the food. My boyfriend refused and then he offered to take it off the bill. Seriously if my boyfriend had swallowed the SPLINTER and any damage had occurred he could have sued.  He talked to another manager after the dissatisfaction with the first one who offered a free entree. But this is honestly not acceptable at all.

Megan B.,"Silver Spring, MD",131,252,551,4.0,5/14/2015,"Summary: great food, great drinks, tough parking, lots of traffic.  Long story: I love the Cheesecake Factory. I mean, I have never had a bad meal here. The food is amazing every time. Yet again I was so starving that I forgot to take a picture of my Cuban sandwich with a side green salad tossed in honey citrus dressing. I can't even tell you how delicious this meal was. The sandwich comes on what can only be described as a miniature baguette. It's toasted, and the cheese is literally melting out of the sides of the sandwich. Definitely more than you can eat in one sitting.  My friend got the sweet corn tamale appetizer. It came with tomato and avocado, and was drizzled in some incredible chipotle sauce.  Also every flavor of cheesecake you could imagine. And they do not disappoint on the cheesecake.  Service was decent, and they have heat lamps for you to sit outside on a patio. I prefer the patio because something about the acoustics makes the atmosphere inside very loud. But they do have a small bar inside, which is nice.  So, this place is apparently across from a music venue (maybe Merriweather Pavilion?). Either way, traffic can be an absolute bear if you don't plan around the concerts. I drove up from Silver Spring today after work, and because a COVER BAND was performing, it took me over an hour and a half to get to the Cheesecake Factory. That's a long time to drive for dinner. So just plan for that. Also, this place is in a mall, and it's hard to find parking on the weekends, but not during the week so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=40

I feel like it's been franchised so much that it's become such a basic restaurant. But the Cheesecake Factory was once such a unique restaurant. Now I feel like it's something very expected.  Despite the generic nature of the restaurant,  I love the Cheesecake Factory. I especially love all of their salads. I am indeed that girl who always asks for extra dressing. I also love all of their pasta selections. I'm also that girl who asks for extra sauce on my pasta. But, hey don't judge a girl solely on her love for sauces and dressings. I prefer extra saltiness and sweetness from sauces, but I'm abnormal. Thus, there is no need to order more dressing and sauces if you are not a sauce fanatic like myself. I usually go for the salad at lunch and the pasta for my dinner selections. You can never go wrong.

Mind you that one of my family members already digested a few pieces already. Once we told the waitress she immediately saw the bread and got the manager. The manager name is Bo Martz (supposedly) came to our table and said he was sorry and he don't know what else to say. We could not believe that's all he said. We had to tell him that he was going to take care our bill and we advise him he should have came to us with solutions and an answer to why we was eating molded bread!

I find the food to be overpriced and unremarkable. Yes, maybe it's because I'm snobby and live in New York City, where I can have a more wonderful culinary experience at half the price. But still, aside from the cheesecake itself, which is delicious, I do not recommend people eat here. But specific to my most recent trip, the hostess told us it would be a 5-10 minute wait. And then did not seat us until 30 minutes later. I don't like it when they undershoot. Next, our server was pretty nice, but when we ordered spinach and artichoke dip, the chips came out completely stale. Like to the point where we were worried we would chip our teeth on them. At this point, we tried to flag down our server, but she was nowhere to be found. There were DOZENS of servers working the floor looking exactly like her, but none of them were actually her.

Mang J.,"Redmond, WA",3,52,7,2.0,7/31/2014,"(Caveat: It's a truth universally acknowledged that The Ol' Mangaretta does not like chain restaurants.) A visit to the Cheesecake Factory equals mediocrity draped under the guise of quantity, but I am not easily fooled. Unfortunately, that's how every experience I've had at the factory usually ends. The only thing that varies wildly is the service. I've had some of the worst and some of the best service at several locations. During this last trip to the factory, it was only the stellar service provided by Amanda that kept this review from carrying a one-star rating. I think she should quit and open up a business where she teaches others how to provide exceptional service. At any rate, since I'm often outvoted by my pals, it's likely that I'll end up at the factory again. When I do, I hope Amanda's working so I can sit in her section. But...I don't care if they serve single portions that would take out Paul Bunyan and the Jolly Green Giant. The food just isn't good. Did someone lose the key to the spice cabinet? I don't want a bowl full of blah. Of all the dishes I've had at every location I've visited, there are probably two that are actually delicious--and that includes the cheesecake. While their cheesecake flavor concepts are wonderfully imaginative, the taste and texture of the cheesecake itself is similar to non-dairy whipped topping if it were thicker and somewhat creamier. Please, Cheesecake Factory, tweak your recipes to make them flavorful. So, two stars for the wonderful Amanda, who I hope harbors entrepreneurial dreams; and minus three stars for mammoth portions of blah food that's searching for its lost shaker of salt and other spices, and thickened Cool Whip for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=140
AJ M.,"Burtonsville, MD",25,16,,4.0,6/21/2014,"If you are not familiar with the Cheesecake Factory, the first thing I want to tell you is that if you don't like reading- don't come here. The menu is about ten dictionaries long, and split across several volumes like the Harry Potter series. When your server comes to ask if you've decided, you will literally burst out into maniacal laughter because you will only be twenty pages in and you're still looking at starter plates. Not to worry. Flip to a random page and point at something and odds are that it is delicious and there is a ton of it. Sarcasm aside, the selection of food here is diverse and extensive. If you don't know those two words, you are really going to have a hard to time with the menu here so you may consider bringing a tutor or some kind of speed-reader to help you along. They seriously have food from all cultures of the world, and even though you would think there's too many types of food for any of them to be great, they regularly excel in all areas. Portions are always immense and also gratifying if taking part of your meal home makes you feel less fat. I usually go for the Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad because something about eating at Cheesecake Factory makes me feel like a hip young white woman. You might not encounter this issue, so dishes like Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp or the Factory Burrito are excellent choices as well. Appetizers like the Crab Wontons or Santa Fe Eggrolls are ridiculously good, but you probably won't find them in the labryinth of a menu. My bet is that you tap out around page 75 and ask the server what he recommends. Don't worry, it's foolproof. Just don't order a Glamburger. I don't know what it is but it sounds like something David Bowie would serve up at an under-21 foam party. If you leave without, at the very least, splitting a piece of Cheesecake- you are dooming yourself to a life without sun and joy. Trust me. You can count calories all day, but the torrent of endorphins your brain will release after one bite of Pineapple Upsidedown Cheesecake will be like a rain of a thousand orgasms. Just order it. If you're that worried, you can order a salad like I do so the waiter doesn't judge you when you finish the whole piece of cheesecake (he will anyway). As far as this specific Cheesecake Factory goes, the wait is long almost all the time. That's a good thing. It reaffirms your decision to come here because 45 minutes worth of other people thought coming here was a good idea too. The service has always been on-point and friendly for me, and if anyone else here got a different result, it's possible they ordered a Glamburger and it is effecting their mood. I took off a star because I can hear the waiter's thoughts when I eat the whipped cream pile after my cheesecake is gone.

Their menu is almost like a novel, they have an option for everyone. It looks like they have a new portion on the menu (i dont know exactly how new this is but it's new to me!) the skinnylicious part which has pretty slim pickings. The calories show in this section ranges between 500-700 calories which is pretty depressing and I just imagine how many calories are in their other dishes? Pretty gross. Anyways, I ordered the turkey and avocado sandwich and I am actually quite surprised it tasted alright. I'm not a big fan of bacon but this dish comes with it just ask your server if the chef can remove the bacon. It comes with a side order of salad (meh). For dessert we ordered the red velvet cake cheesecake which was simply divine (1200 calories/slice). I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but I do enjoy more cake than cheesecake so this choice in dessert was perfect with 50/50. The slices are huge so it can be shared with two people maybe even three.

It is way too complex and long....the choices and food variety is almost over the top. I learned from watching those Food tv shows that restaurants should keep the menu to a page or two and do it really well! Cheesecake Factory executives must have missed that business advise.  Lets talk about noise level....the way the tables are positioned, you are literally on top of your neighbor. At several points in the meal, I covered my ears. It was like high school cafeteria. I kept hearing about three or four conversations all around me. I even learned that the lady a few tables down hated sleeping with her husband Greg. Anyway, point being it is so distracting you can't even enjoy your food. So my days at all Cheesecake Factories are over.

It was so awkward and uncomfortable. The manager insisted that her food had been cooked properly even though the waitress had already agreed with her that it was undercooked and offered to bring her something else, but after being confronted by the manager she insisted on paying her tab and leaving. The manager had the guts to stand next to her table and say ""No, I assure you, we would never give out raw food"" instead of just apologizing and comping the meal.

We had also called the place to try and make a reservation but they told us that they don't take reservations. Bunch of stuck-up overdressed customers were here, packed parking-lot around the area as well... thought I had just arrived at Tysons 2 or something, lol. The bread was good that we got before our food arrived. The black tea I didn't care for as it was strong and bitter, but I didn't want to get there fruit flavored tea, so I stuck to drinking the water. The artichoke dip was fair but could've been a bit better I thought. I got the spicy cashew chicken which was pretty tasty and not overly spicy which was good because I like to enjoy my food without breaking a sweat, this was definitely the best CF dish I've tried thus far but something about it still seemed a bit off to me. I also had the Godiva Cheesecake which was pretty much the way it sounded but topped with a dallop of whip cream on top and another dallop on the plate. The decor looks like most CF factories, like a knock-off version of a Las Vegas establishment, heh. The 2-people tables are small (one side booth and one side chair) and very close to the neighboring tables, luckily my butt didn't get in someones food upon sitting on the booth side. The menu's looked like a book, we joked how they might as well have us open a huge newspaper but then we'd hit the people beside us, lol.

Lawrence S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",29,12,,2.0,11/22/2015,"First off, considering that the Cheesecake Factory is a chain establishment, most of what I'm going to say is going to sound repetitive to those who've experienced plenty of these restaurants. Anyways, first off, slow service, while the waiters are courteous, being such a huge restaurant with many tables, it's impossible to catch the attention of a worker, especially so when I'm seated at the booth where the cursory look of the waiter will most like zip right past your upraised hand, either that or the waiter just turns around and walks out of the lane of tables that they are waiting because you were seated right in the middle of that corridor, like how I was with my family. Waitress got my order wrong, had to wait another 25 mins after the rest of the food came to even taste any of my food. Eggplant Parmesean lunch item, they gave me chicken parm btw. And when I it came to the bill, realized they charged me for the dinner value of the parm when I asked for the lunch version. Brought this up with my waitress, says that they charged me the dinner parm because that's what they gave me, messed up the order here again as you can see, told her my stance of how I'm not paying for their mistake, which St that point she told me she will bring this issue up with er manager. Truthfully, felt a bit insulted that they thought to charge me the whole value of any meal item considering the rest of my table was done with their food and waited another 15 minutes or so while I start munching on my food when it arrived. It's the little things, but service is the bread and butter of any restaurant, regardless of being an independent restaurant or a franchise. Regardless, food is mediocre, and the rush job on my food at this point left me with a eggplant dish still a little more raw in the center than it should be, and pasta that had not taken the extra 5 secs to properly coat with the pesto. Had bunches of just plain noodle uncoated staring at me. Know I'm being a repetitive, but the small things that you overlook is what cost you in anything you do.

I actually close my eyes and savor the food here, which is a good sign. Some items that have elicited that reaction include: -shrimp toast on a stick w/ sauce: these could be properly described as shrimp and veggie meatballs paired with an orange/pink sauce...clean and fresh with a nice crust -vietnamese tacos (don't be fooled--I would have usually been turned off thinking of having to bite into a hard corn shell, but NO, this came with those white, enriched-flour steamed buns used in asian pastry stores! Like a pork bun, with laces of red pepper and lettuce--yum) -chicken samosas with a green sauce (these are unique; it's like ground meat in a thin, crispy phyllo dough type of wrapper; I appreciate that better than the tough, thick, fried dough that usually encases samosas in Indian food places. So it's not real traditional samosas, but I'd say if you're into low-carb, you'd appreciate) -thai lettuce wraps (better than P.F. Changs, hands down! Big, clean pieces of lettuce, good quality chicken filling, and several sauces to choose from, along with sprouts, purple lettuce, etc. this is a meal in itself, one of the largest appetizers) -summer rolls (better than the ones from real pho places...sorry, those run the risk of tasting fishy but the ones here at Cheesecake are Americanized to the point where there isn't that ""fishy"" taste) -Evelyn's favorite pasta (great vegetarian option) -Salmon, diane steak, shrimp combo platter (small cuts of meat that do not overwhelm, but there are several pieces so the portion size is ample overall) -salads (these are HUGE and can be taken home) -and of course, the cheesecakes and desserts...the ultimate red velvet cheesecake was a trip.

On my most recent visit, my waitress could not be found when needed more than once. When she was asked for the check she forgot which I can understand.  The second time we asked she responded with, ""Oh I didn't think you were really ready for the check.""  Once we were ready to pay the check she never stopped by to cash us out so we had to ask another waiter.   I tasted the Cream of Mushroom Soup, The Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, and Miso Salmon.  All of these food items were delicious.  The only reason my rating is not worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=200
Garvin C.,"Ellicott City, MD",13,216,3,3.0,7/27/2010,"The Cheesecake factory I think is one of the better national chain restaurants in terms of food and variety. This particular location has been pretty consistent with putting out good meals. I've ordered a few different pasta dishes, sandwiches, and burgers, and each time the entree has come out cooked well (e.g. pasta was never overcooked, sauces not way too salty or gloppy, sandwiches not too oily or put together poorly, etc.). Of course, their desserts are delicious, but only something you should eat every once in a while (they are really bad for your health if you eat it often!).  The decor is a little over the top in my opinion, but it's nice and airy in there. One thing that really get to be here are the floors. They can be kind of slick, so be careful walking near the kitchen area! The service for the most part is fine, but for some reason I never get the feeling that they want to take good care of me as a customer. Not sure why though, but I never feel entirely comfortable here. Parking can be tough since it is at the Columbia Mall, so you might be parked far away.

Amy H.,"Rockville, MD",0,5,,1.0,4/2/2015,"Wow. We had a horrible experience here, which is unfortunate because we drove from Rockville due to our previous good experiences. Our waitress asked my husband to open the wine bottle because she didn't know how, then didn't even pour the wine. Ok, fine, we're not snobs so whatever. Then our entrees took over 30 minutes to come out. The manager stopped by to say they were coming out in a few minutes but it was much longer and we were never offered more bread or anything. When the salmon salad got there, it was raw. Totally slimy and raw. I left most of it and told the waitress so she said they get that complaint a lot and they would just put the food on my plate back on the grill. Um, gross. We ordered a slice of cheesecake to split since I was still hungry, and they split it so unevenly it was comical. I'm not convinced they split a full piece, it was tiny and usually the cheesecake slices are way too big for us. The clincher was when I paid with a $100 and the waitress asked -- 15 minutes after picking up our folder -- if we needed change.

The food tends to be americanized-fusion cuisine of some sort that's sometimes really good or something just OK.  If you love authenticity when it comes to food, don't come here.  Food portions are really large, but there's nothing to seriously rave about when it comes to their entrees.  My sister loves their fried mac n cheese appetizer.  Their potstickers are eh.     Cheesecake is extremely overpriced at $7.50 a slice, but they do have a large variety of flavors.  If anything, go for a strawberry shortcake or regular cake.  They are massive desserts that you can share with several people and not have to worry about the fat and calories that a slice of cheesecake would have.

Su K.,"Washington, DC",229,428,582,3.0,5/27/2008,"Today was the first time I decided where I wanted to eat because I wanted to Yelp about it. Yes, it is a chain restaurant, but after ragging on the Rockville location, I wanted to let my fellow Yelpers know about this not-so-secret dining delight in Columbia, MD...but it wasn't to be. With chain restaurants, the food/decor/coasters are predictable, but what sets chains apart are the little things; and they lacked in the little things. For example, after dropping my mom and wife off in front of the restaurant and parking in that ridiculously crowded lot, I walked toward the restaurant while pushing my baby girl in a stroller. As  I approached the door, I noticed a server exiting the restaurant--as evidenced by her all white ensemble--possibly having just ended her shift.. Having been a dad for 3+ months now, I've learned that pushing a stroller will A) draw ladies of all ages - pied piper, thy name is Graco and B) cause random people to open doors for you. She didn't even bother to hold the door for me -- and I was definitely within a reasonable please-hold-the-door/elevator distance. Food - I was unimpressed with the Chinese Chicken Salad - it had all these crispy, stringy things, and while I'm normally a fan of all things fried, these overwhelmed the salad. My wife and mom both had the Thai Lettuce Wraps, which are always fantastic! Highly recommended (they are on the appetizer menu). Note: they have lunch portions until 5p.m. for $8.95-$9.95 (normally $13+), which is a great deal for the salads since salads are typically no good as leftovers. The only cabbage/lettuce that should be soggy is kim chi! Also, we decided to mix things up and try the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. It was ok, but we should have stuck with our old favorite, White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Service - This is what used to set this location apart, not just from other Cheesecakes, but other establishments in Columbia, particularly since the majority of restaurants in Columbia seem to be a part of a chain. The key word is used to. The previous times we've dined here, the server brought out some steaming, moist towels with fresh lemons after our meal because the Thai Lettuce Wraps can get messy. Not this time. Admittedly, the server wasn't bad, but he was just another chain server. Location - The waits tend to be much better here than in Rockville. A wait here however, makes sense because The Mall in Columbia does get crowded and I imagine all the shoppers get tired of Sarku after a while. Additionally, this location is very kid friendly. They'll park your stroller and have wide enough aisles that putting a high chair next to your table won't violate a fire code. Finally, there is outdoor seating (as Ina K. noted) which offers a view of the movie theater, a large office building, and a town home. This place used to stand out but it now looks like another predictable link in the chain. Other nearby offerings include: Uno, Champps (I don't know what the 2nd 'p' stands for, but probably not ""Popular"" as I've never seen this place too crowded), and the Food Court. Personally, I'd stick with Cheesecake or make the drive over to the lake for Sushi Sono or Waterside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=280
Allison S.,"Baltimore, MD",19,168,8,4.0,6/30/2010,"Cheesecake Factory never fails! Even on busy nights the wait is rarely over 15 minutes, everything arrives to your table in a timely manner, the waitress refills your water as needed, and all you have to do is hear a couple speeches about the soup of the day and some new cake that gives a  dollar to homeless people.  I will admit that Farzan's CFIF is real, but the key to avoiding it is to bring someone with you who will eat all of his own food, and then eat half of yours.  Usually I get a small plate salad, an appetizer, and then split a slice of cheesecake. The small plates are the best thing to happen to CF, because they are regular portioned meals. I recommend avoiding the entrees. The food is definitely tasty, and I think it is worth the money since they give you so much of it. Just bring some home if you hate big portions that much!

I've always said that there's a conspiracy at Cheesecake Factory - Considering the size of the restaurant, how can every Cheesecake Factory in the United States have a 45+ minute wait? It baffles my mind! And this Cheesecake is no different.  The food is the same as any of the other 29389045 Cheesecakes in the country, but what I do love about this location is their outdoor dining area. Yes, you're facing a mammoth parking lot; And yes, there are delinquent high schoolers hanging outside the movie theater next door...but somehow, you'll find peace and serenity on this patio, away from the shouting acoustics of the indoor dining room. I'm giving this place three stars - One for the beautiful patio, another for always having at least ONE thing I like (the menu is humaangous, but at least you have your pick), and a third for being a great default dinner spot anywhere in the entire country. :) Like any other Cheesecake, wait times dramatically decrease after 8pm, so you should be able to find a table indoors or outdoors later in the evening.

I figures this would work. 4:00 on a Saturday and there was a wait for the patio. Oh how I hate Columbia sometimes. They sat us in the very back of the patio, not a big deal, but not the best seat by far. Pineapple Mojito was delicious. We tried the guacamole-medium and it was pretty descent. I liked that it had chunks of avocado in it. The shrimp summer rolls were actually pretty good. Crisp asparagus, fresh herbs, good sized shrimp, but nothing close to authentic with ramen noodles inside. The white bean hummus was descent, but nothing too special. the pita it came with tasted like grill and nothing like bread. it was very strange. We got two pieces of cheesecake to go. so, a total of 6 drinks, 3 apps and 2 pieces of cheesecake were about $105! A little pricey. We were there for 2 1/2 hours and our waitress was okay.

Lauren H.,"Columbia, MD",0,3,,2.0,8/12/2009,"The food is pretty good here but pretty pricey. $7.00 for a slice of cheesecake is way overpriced imo. The cheesecakes also range from 1000-2000 calories per slice from my research. However, if you still must get a cheesecake, the fresh strawberry and white chocolate raspberry cheesecake taste really good. Also, i'm not sure if the 45mins-2.5hour waits are worth it. I think this chain is pretty overrated... If you go on a weekend night, be prepared for the long wait. They don't take reservations or call ahead seating. It is also very loud and cold inside so I prefer sitting on the patio. Their clam chowder soup is probably one of the better soups. It can be a little too creamy however. My favorite dish is the miso salmon. It is really yummy with the salmon served on top of the rice. It costs $20 for the dish but try to go during their lunch hours (till 5pm) and I believe it costs around $13?  The ladies room.....is disgusting. No toilet paper in all the stalls, trash overflowing, and water all over the counters. Try to avoid it if possible.  Overall, I give it a 2.

We placed or orders and we were sipping on our drinks when my boyfriend found some odd white thing floating around in his drink. We told the server and she got us a new one. Great-it was fine. We ordered the Thai lettuce wraps as an appetizer which was good. His factory burrito came out looking like an enchilada more than a burrito. Which is still fine. My fettuccine Alfredo came out. I took a small bite. I eat very salty.. But this wasn't even edible. Too damn salty. The server asked if I wanted Parmesan cheese which I responded yes then realized how damn stay it was and said no the pasta is salty as it is. She said oh should I get them to remake it and I said it was fine because I didn't want to be too annoying. At that exact moment I found pieces of broccoli in my pasta. This pasta doesn't come with broccoli... Which I then slightly moved the spoon (the spoon that comes on the side with all pasta dishes) guess what I found? A piece of withered leafy green. And it was a big one too. Lost my appetite. The server watched me unveil that SOB too. She was disgusted too. Did what she could, offered me a new one, a different dish, etc. but do you think I really want to eat after seeing that? I know I went in 40 minutes before closing time but isn't that ridiculous? I didn't even complain. Like who knows where those broccoli bits and withered leafy green came from?! From another dish? Maybe the plate itself was dirty? Was the spoon dirty? Was it even washed? Were they cleaning the back, getting ready to go and those bits happened to fly into my dish?! I don't know!! Yeah. No thanks. The manager came over saying ""oh I looked at your dish. What was wrong with it..?"" Lol I just looked at her and then explained what I had found in it.. She just offered a new dish to which I declined. That's it. Shitty management. Server did what she could. They took off the Alfredo off the bill. Obviously. Was totally disgusted. Definitely not acceptable.

SHE is the only reason i calmed down. its sad an employee needs to do the managers job! and he is the SAME guy who has dealt with my wrong orders before and NEVER offers to compensate. i will get his name next time so i can post here. p.s.

Richard M.,"Columbia, MD",41,17,6,3.0,8/5/2015,"So, my whole family loves The Cheesecake Factory. I have fallen in love with cheesecake since I first tried it in college and am now on a goal to make up for all of the opportunities I have missed out prior to my awakening. That being said, this onetime shining star of quality cuisine and service has become tarnished...at least at this location. First, the cheesecake is amazing and at this point no one can even question that. It is rich and creamy and without a doubt heavens streets are paved with it. This is also the only reason it get 3 stars. However, the service is no longer stellar. At a recent visit our waitress with 5 tables and only 3 filled was horrible. I ordered soup that was horrible, more on that later, and it sat in front of me for a good 10 minutes before she ever appeared to see if we were okay. She apologised for the food and took it off the bill but still. Then my friend ordered a pasta dish and waited about ten minutes to get some olive oil and cheese. She asked for no sauce and olive oil when she ordered. This is also not the first time, a week prior we waited 20 minutes for soup, hmmm maybe it is the soup, before the waitperson returned to say it would be another 30 minutes for soup. What? Now the food. Let's talk about the Chicken Tortilla Soup I ordered as an appetiser. Normally, The Cheesecake Factory has amazing soups...normally. This soup was wretched. First, it was more like day old oatmeal then soup in both consistency and taste than soup. Seriously canned soup would have been better. The taste was mealy and had the overwhelming taste of Corn Masa. There was no chicken to be found in the Chicken Tortilla Soup and it was garnished with a pool of grease and some corn. And the smell!  Even the patrons next to us were offended.  The Main dishes were good, although not as tasty as you would think. I had the combo Steak Diane and Chicken Marsala. The Steak Diane was wonderful but under seasoned. The Chicken Marsala was excellent but the Mashed Potatoes were cold clumpy and not good at all. Between the poor service and the not so great food, I feel like this once amazing establishment is on the decline. I will speak to a manager and try them again in a few months and update my review, but until then I would recommend take out cheesecake and dining some place else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=120

His response?  Sorry, we have new cooks.   New cooks?  This is a well known chain restaurant.  People come here for known dishes of a known quality, and they pay rather highly for that along with a moderately upscale ambience.  The cooks need to perform regardless of how old or new they are, that's why they train them.   The only good explanation would have been if all the cooks were out at once and the waitstaff were forced to cook and some half-senile man was forced out of retirement to oversee the cooking.  Then perhaps we could have commiserated over his sad failure rather than the failure of this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=220

Starr C.,"McLean, VA",128,294,427,3.0,8/15/2011,"I was here Saturday for lunch with my roommates. Wait time was about 20 minutes, so not too bad considering it was Saturday. We got seated and yeah, it's a bit squished, being that close to the other tables. I just have to remind myself that if there were less tables more spaced apart, the wait time would be more ridiculous than usual. Our waiter was pretty attentive even though his section was really busy. We ordered and the bread was a bit slow coming out, but again, it was pretty busy. Not totally sure how fast our food came out, because we were catching up and talking a lot, but it didn't seem like a very long wait. I got the chicken salad sandwich (it comes with almonds) with side of green salad. Was pretty big, for which I'm glad because you know Cheesecake Factory isn't cheap! Buttered, which made for flavor and also a bit of a mess for me to eat. I tried to be a lady, but to no avail. My friends seemed pretty happy with their orders, also. I didn't hear any major complaints about their food, and I know I snuck some sweet potato fries. Dessert. We didn't get cheesecake (the horror, right?) because I don't like cheesecake. I'll let you process that and then move on. My friend wanted just strawberries because she tries to keep healthy but definitely indulged with a giant burger with bacon and Fontina cheese and fries instead of the salad, so she just got the bowl of strawberries which comes with a bowl of cream. The rest of us shared a strawberry shortcake. I had some problems with it. It was presented beautifully - shortcake then vanilla ice cream then more short cake then strawberries then a mountain of cream with strawberries all around - but I took issue with the shortcake. The ice cream was nice, although I didn't eat much of it because I would've preferred if it was a bit softer. The shortcake was NOT soft enough. I was definitely expecting more of a spongy type of cake, but it was kind of hard, like the shell of a cream puff. I just checked shortcake, and sometimes it's like a biscuit, but it should be cake. Spongy. Soft. I could barely get pieces of it off to eat with the strawberries, so I basically also had strawberries with cream for dessert, with a few bites of ice cream. Bottom line: you get a nice experience and great food at the Cheesecake Factory. I'm kind of on a college budget, so I probably won't indulge in it TOO often (you know), but I have no major complaints.

Gerson R.,"San Diego, CA",16,27,2,2.0,6/30/2011,"So....I absolutely LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. You're probably wondering why I'm giving a bad review then. I will tell you. The CF is awesome for lunch and dinner, and even better for the cheesecake, however, they failed epically when it came to brunch. I'm not sure I've ever had such a terrible breakfast. I ordered the Brunch Combo, while my fiance ordered French Toast Napoleon.  The Combo consisted of eggs, bacon, and pancakes. The eggs were good, but unfortunately, they were the only good part of my meal. The bacon felt like rubber had very little flavor. The pancakes were absolutely horrendous! They reminded me of the McDonald's hotcakes... but worse.  The Napoleon wasn't as bad, but it definitely wasn't great. The toast they use is the same toast they use for the Grilled Chicken Avocado Club Sandwich. It tastes fantastic with the sandwich, but as french toast, not so much... To make matters worse, our server was very inattentive and I think may have been allergic to happiness and smiling. He brought us out cold and hard bread, and brought me a lukewarm coffee.  The only reason I'm giving this review 2 stars is because another server, who actually was friendly and attentive (even though it wasn't her table), catered to our needs that our MIA server didn't fulfill, and because she brought me a nice and hot cup of coffee. The coffee is really great there. It's definitely in my top 3 that I've had. Conclusively, don't go here for brunch. Any other time is good, but save breakfast foods for another place.

On the other hand, my husband had the pumpkin pecan and he said it was really good. I went to this specific location twice and both times I noticed that the staff likes to gather around the register during their breaks.

Myself and my guest were seated after a small 20 minute wait. Not a problem. 11 minutes go by and no one asked us for our drink order or to say ""Hey, how ya doin?"" I had to grab another server to see if she could find ours. She brings me the manager, he said he's sorry and dessert is on him. So we place our order with the girl I grabbed, still have not met our actual server. Someone brings out my guests drink, mine never came. I go to the hostess desk and ask for a manager who assures me he will go find our server. Meanwhile he brings out my drink. A few minutes later a server comes out begging for forgiveness, which I was obviously not interested in giving. I just wanted my food so I could get out of there. So our food comes out and it is literally missing main food items, no bacon and no strawberries! I ask the server ""Didn't this come with bacon? And I added strawberries to my pancakes!"" He looked at me and said I can go get you some bacon like that's not what was listed on the menu and I was inconveniencing him. Unbelievable! By the way, my potatoes and eggs were like warm, which I kept to myself. So the check comes, I tell the server about our free dessert offer and he says ""Well let me go find out about that.""

She did and immediately went to get the GM.  It took him a few minutes to come over. While we were waiting my husband vomit in the bathroom.  The GM finally came over and I told him that there was a roach in my food and to look it - he refused and said he believed me.  I demanded my money back.  He was looking for the receipt.  I was so distraught that I couldn't even find the receipt.  We explained that we were just there less than 20 minutes ago so you would think it would have been easy to find our order.  While he's searching for the receipt - I explained that we were frequent patrons of the CF and had never experienced such a disgusting and nasty incident as this.  He said in all his 8 years of working at CF that he had never experienced anything like it either.  He was apologetic and offered free food and dessert.  Really?  Are you serious? I wouldn't even want a glass of water from this darn place!  I was so disgusted - just the image of the roach in my food and to think that I may have eaten one - made me nausea that I went to the restroom and threw up!  When I came back out, hubby was holding his head down - not feeling well at all.  Not to mention we were late for the concert at this point and had to decide whether to go or forfeit the $200+ that we spent on tickets.  We went on to the concert - although we really couldn't enjoy it because I couldn't help but think about the incident. I contacted the health department and they are investigating the incident.  Now I am completely turned off from eating at any restaurant.  It took me awhile to eat after the incident because I couldn't get the image out of my head of the roach crawling on my food.  I couldn't sleep that well either.  This incident has forced me to cook my own food from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=240

Very busy night and because they don't do reservations, the wait was super long - about an hr and 5-10 min before we were finally seated. We ordered appetizers as we were drinking while the other 2 in our party ordered entrees -- ** Egg roll sampler -- this we loved! Delicious and flavorful!! ** Salmon Rolls -- it was alright though I feel it could be better. The salmon was dry and a little bland. ** Buffalo Chicken wings -- good! I ordered this without the sauce because I was craving fried chicken wings and this was pretty straightforward - juicy, flavorful and good! ** Dynamite shrimp -- this was NOT good!! Shrimp was overly breaded, no flavor and there was nothing dynamite about the sauce at all!! ** Grilled Steak Medallions (ordered to be shared as appetizer) -- I was kind of iffy about ordering steak here and the rest of the party advised I shouldn't  since its not a streak place but I went ahead and ordered it since I was craving steak. I ordered the steak medium rare but when they brought it out it was from medium to mostly well done (not happy about that). The flavor was OK but upset about how the steak was cooked (not medium rare)! Should've listened to everyone! ** Country Salad -- Good salad!! Didn't taste the entrees of the other 2 in the party so won't add those to the review... My final take on here -- food was sub par, mediocre (not including the desserts). Not worth the pricing or the wait. Service was just okay though I do understand that this was a very busy night and the servers may have been a little stressed with all the pressure.

It's close to where we live and it's conveniently located in the Columbia Mall. We often go to the mall before or after coming here. The Cheesecake Factory offers a huge selection of entrees and delicious desserts. The variety of entrees is expansive, with options that are American, Chinese, Indian, Seafood, and many other types. Absolutely have to try out their cheesecakes, it's in their name! Sometimes we'll be in the mood for something light and healthy(-ish), sometimes we'll be in the mood for something heavy and filling, and we'll often be satisfied with our options here. The food is decent but not stunning. Portion size is very generous and many times I have to bring home leftovers. They also offer good, warm bread as an opener. Some personal favorites include: Fried Cheese, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and Tomato Basil Pasta with Chicken.  Service is usually good but sometimes is lacking. Usually we have waiters who are very friendly and attentive but other times we barely see them. The wait time can get long if you show up during prime hours (6-7:30PM).

I ordered the Fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls. They were great as usually. Could of used a bit more marinara sauce but other than that they were great.

I'm curious if this location has a different policy on improperly prepared food, since the entree was not removed from my check? I would have said something, again, however, since I was out with fellow colleagues, I let it go.

I decided to celebrate her bday there with group of 13...we had to wait for 1 hour on a Monday night ..and then I showed the front desk person how much space is there to fit us..they then accommodated us It took 30 minutes before someone came to take our order...another 30 to get first round of drinks..I was already disappointed with the service and called the manger...she came..her name was Lauren..I explained what is going on and she said she will take care We ordered appetizers and dinner...right after I ordered that I told the waitress that It's my wife's bday and I need a full cake of carrot cake to surprise her and wish her..she said that she will bring it..I confirmed 3 times...when the dinner was done ..she tells me that it is frozen and not edible! I was disappointed but went to the counter and told to her to bring 4 different slices...it took her another 30 minutes and no one was there! I got up and asked for the manager again..Lauren came again and I explained her the whole story and how disappointed I was.... In the end Lauren tells me that she will convey to the waitress and tells me that if I come back they will give me a cheesecake! Lmao Thank you Lauren I don't need it and thanks for your team for screwing up my wife's bday!!! Very disappointed with a. Company that me and my wife have loved for years... Not sure if higher management cares for these reviews or not but they sure did lose a loyal customer today... Never going back there again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia

Tiffany K.,"Baltimore, MD",30,52,26,3.0,9/18/2016,"Cheesecake is great of course and the servers are nice.  A ton of options to choose from but it is overpriced. It's been my experience that the dishes are either barely seasoned at all or over seasoned (to the point of being inedible) a little balance would go a long way. Also, if your meal comes with some sort of meat, for instance a pasta dish with chicken, there won't be much meat in it.

The wait was about 10minutes, no not because they were busy but only because it took a while to obtain eye contact from the host that was right in front of us. This food was just very messy, no regards to presentation and cleanliness as everything was dripping everywhere on my plate and off. The silverware had a couple of stains on them. The food I did get a chance to eat was very good which was the bread and the nacho appetizers! Our waitress was very nice but this place has changed.

The customer service was terrible. My brother had to go find our server twice. The food she brought out was cold. She gave the food to us and just left, never came back to ask how everything is. Once my brother found her I told her my food is cold. She goes oh we can fix that. After waiting for another 30 mins while everyone else was done eating. My food came and it was tomato sauce where pasta was floating and no cheese and this dish is called 4 cheese pasta. Once again the server was gone and no where to be found. Once she came back she goes oh we can not add cheese once we reheat the pasta.I was like how can I eat this and before I could finish what I had to say. She cut me off and said oh our kitchen is going down and haven't been making good food but I will have the manager take it out of ur check.

Lacey I.,"Williamsburg, VA",26,5,1,5.0,6/30/2016,"For my first time visiting the chain, I was very impressed. There was a large crowd waiting for tables when we arrived at around 7 on a Tuesday. There were numerous open tables, and the hostesses were steadily seating guests; keeping the wait times minimal and not overwhelming the waitstaff.  We ordered 3 courses: appetizers, sandwiches and of course cheesecake. Our Fried Mac and Cheese was tasty but a little cool at the center. Both sandwiches we ordered were delicious and huge. We could only eat half and have the rest boxed. Our cheesecakes, to go, were also great. Our service by Kumba was the highlight of the evening. Her timing and service were outstanding. We never needed anything but we didn't feel bothered. She was very friendly and warm and made us feel welcome. We plan on asking for her when we return and recommend that you do the same.

The food is always hot and fresh, and is served with a becoming presentation.  I have eaten there several times as I live in this area, will always go back, just wish the tables weren't so closed together, there is no privacy when you would like to have a private conversation.  As well as the wait not being so long.

Looked like they took it out the trash and mounted it up on the plate to actually serve. We called the manager and he actually admitted that they place all plates on a hot counter under heating lamps for pickup that the waiters take to tables. But, why are cold meals, especially a damn salad on the hot counters under heating lamps?  I wish Chef Ramsey was there to check those plates and give hell to the chefs.

Connie Y.,"Rockville, MD",254,97,1425,3.0,9/25/2014,"I ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake and got a lemon Raspberry Creme Cheesecake. 'Nough said.   On the upside, their Bistro Shrimp Pasta was as good as usual and with that extra Parmesan sprinkled on top, makes for a delectable pasta dish. With fresh mushrooms, lightly battered shrimp, arugula, and tomatoes tossed into spaghetti, it is one of the better dishes at Cheesecake. Quite buttery, but not too creamy. You may want to ask for less salt on the dish. My friend ordered the Farfelle with chicken and roasted garlic and much to my delight, the garlic-parmesan creaminess wasn't  too overwhelming. The mixture of peas, tomatoes, and mushrooms helped to lighten the creaminess of the pasta. If you enjoy creamy pastas and cute bow-tie pasta, please try. Overall, it was a satisfying if not sufficient meal. Do come back for their happy hour though.

Entree: The Louisiana Chicken Pasta and wow talk about scrumptious. It was seasoned to perfection; I am not one who typically opts for a spicy dish but man oh man this was worth it. I highly recommend. You can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not get Cheesecake!! I stuck to what I know and love the succulent original cheesecake with strawberries and whipped cream!

Ericka G.,"Columbia, MD",262,419,1625,2.0,6/24/2014,"I've been here a million times and strangely my service is better than when they are insanely busy.  My niece is sick so we ordered ginger ale. Apparently that soft drink does not have free refills. We ordered soup, I asked her for crackers. Apparently all of the CF has no crackers. Strike 1. The small plates on the table under the napkins weren't clean. The waitress heard when I said these aren't clean, turned around then turned back around pretending she heard not a thing. She never brought us plates, we even got our apps, still no plates. I got them from a random waitstaff men that I waved down. Also my nephew asked, ""why is it that when you speak to him, he speaks back and when you ask him to do something he does it.... Why doesn't OUR waitress behave that way?"" From the mouths of babes.... Strike 2. The waitress was not friendly nor accommodating. I'm here with children ages 8, 12, 13, & 17, she addressed no one. More aloof and irritated that we were making her have to work. Strike 3. At present, this chick is getting a 10% tip with a comment on my bill from me.  I'm not impressed. As I left, my very absent waitress Ashley was discovered to be chatting it up at server station by the bar. She: 1. Did take the small plates after I addressed her directly that they were all dirty. She never brought us more. We were served bread & our appetizers and still no plates. I had to wave down a random server. He got us the plates. The plates were stored in the cabinet directly in front of our table. He apologized for our waitress. 2. She never came back to clear our table after the entrees arrived. 3. She never gave eye contact. She was very short and seemingly annoyed. That was just her attitude. Yes, I was there with kids, but they know how to behave when out with me so, her attitude was not in anyway provoked. 4. Two random servers checked on us and we got boxes from them. The second server was who got our waitress because we were already packed up and needed the check. That server got her from wherever she was chatting & she then asked if we needed boxes (which clearly we didn't because we had already bagged & boxed ourselves AND consolidated all the plates so it would be easy to clear the table).  I decided not to tip her and to leave her a note on the check instead. The note just said that she missed out on the tip because her colleagues did what she was supposed to do. May I remind you, the restaurant was DEAD. Very few people there. More servers than patrons. I spoke to the manager as I left and he was embarrassed. I praised the other servers and let him know I an frequent customer (who lives very close by) and know her behavior was not standard. He gave me his card and assured me that at my next visit, is have optimal service. Now, that's how it's done. Brava manager!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=60

Amira M.,"Orlando, FL",104,167,130,1.0,6/20/2015,"The one star is for the sliver of delicious cheesecake I bought from the take out counter.   My husband, son, and I went here for lunch after a movie. My son and I walk up to a rather distracted hostess and asked for a table for three.  She spoke to me without looking at me and directed us to stand to the side.  Another woman came up to us and said, ""Table for two?"" I told her no, three.  She looks confused and speaks to the first hostess who says, ""She said two.  Now she wants three?"" Rolled her eyes and made a face.  The second hostess seemed annoyed with me.  I watched as at least four other groups were seated, all who came after us and two were also parties of three. The side plates were wet, the silverware was mostly dirty, and the server was rude.  I asked her for new plates, telling her they were wet and dirty.  She made a face and started examining them. ""Just this one is dirty,"" she said.  Great start, I'm thinking.   She messes up our drink order and barely is around expect to drop off our food and then our check.  The replacement silverware she brought was also dirty so we shared what was mostly clean.  I could not get out of there fast enough.  The food was a tiny bit above fast food and definitely not worth the prices charged. The service was rude and super pretentious for no reason.  I've been to other cheesecake factories so I knew going in it's a chain, but the Arundel Mills location is so much better. They are much nicer and serve uniform slices of cheesecake. It was confusing when I got home and saw how little the slice was.  What did they do? Shave a bit off from the factory portion?? I was paying for my takeout order and another customer started talking to me about the bad food there.  I told her about my brown guacamole and bad service.  The cashier said, ""Well you could have ordered a salad.  At least those are good."" Really? I'm saying how horrible the food and service was to another customer and your only addition is to tell me to order something else?

Amy A.,"Columbia, MD",2,14,,1.0,7/24/2017,"Judging by the sheer amount of people always at this place I can only conclude that everyone in Columbia has no idea what good food tastes like. This place is everything I hate about chain restaurants, from the terrible food, to the insane prices, and it's constantly packed. I was in here the other day just to get a drink before a movie and the bar was packed with people waiting for tables and they had only 2 bartenders serving the entire restaurant, I felt really bad for them because they seemed like they were doing a good job and really trying. Unfortunately there was a stuck up lady at the bar who kept tapping the bar like she was at a blackjack table and sighing because her drink wasn't getting filled fast enough. I literally only went in here because they closed Uno's and Chammps (not that I like those places either) and there wasn't a closer bar nearby to grab a drink. The only plus side was that the drink was well made.

We waited about 45 minutes which was the estimated time, unfortunately they tried to seat us at a dirty table and we had to wait an additional 5 minutes. Every time we eat here, it is a mixed bag. Some entrees are pretty decent, and some are average at best. I enjoy the chicken madeira and steak diane, but don't enjoy the mashed potatoes that are the consistency of a softball.  On this occasion, I made the mistake of ordering the chicken enchiladas. They were average at best, but one will typically receive a better portion for the $$ at a mexican restaurant. Everyone else's food arrived and the manager came over to the table to explain they had to remake mine. I appreciate the manager coming over, but not the fact that everyone else was halfway done with their food when my entree arrived. The service here is also inconsistent. I think the servers are competent overall from our experiences here, but it seems they have too much to handle.  My advice would be to simply the menu and take out the mediocre items.

With my spouse being 6'7 it was ridiculous that the hostess would even place us at the table when he literally would not be able to sit comfortably. We asked for a separate table and were placed directly next to the kitchen. This was not ideal and wasn't understandable as we arrived at around 9:30pm and the restaurant wasn't busy. We asked to be moved again and we're seated in a spacious booth next to the window viewing the outdoor seating. Everything was going well and our food came out quickly.

If you want a lighter/healthier option..go for the salmon appetizer. The thai glaze with it had a great taste.

The bbq ranch dressing left alot to be desired..it was bland....I asked the waitress to bring me honey mustard..that didnt help either. The chicken was tasteless.

The girl at the counter says are you sure and she says again yea let's put her here and grabs some menus. These two girls walked in right after us so we have to wait but ex employees don't??  Than I think it was the manager a white guy with a pin stripe shirt I couldn't tell if he was spitting into his coffee cup or drinking cause I never seen him raise the cup just put it to his mouth. Than after 35 min they seat us. The waiter was attentive came right over for our drinks. We order buffalo blast as an app he got the filet I got the chicken belligio. OMG!!! That's when the wait started. After 25 min we got apps another 35-40 the dinner. You'd think the dinner would be hot NO!!!!  My husband wanted well done got med pink all the way through dry cold!!!  My pasta was cold dry and sticking to the plate I ordered extra cream sauce and the noodles sucked that up. The chicken was cold. Terrible!  The manager came over to the table beside us and says to them. I'm so sorry for the wait your food shouldn't take much longer. Never came over to us to say nothing.

Laurie W.,"Rockville, MD",444,189,,2.0,3/28/2009,"There is always a ridiculous wait at every Cheesecake Factory. I think people expect to see actual cheesecakes rolling out the door on a conveyor belt and that idea is so lovely that it's just like, yeah, I'm going THERE.  That is not what happens there. What happens there, usually, is you wait a long time for a table and then you sit down and it's loud and menu is like a little plastic confusing book and you pick something that sounds like it's less than perhaps 8000 grams of fat and the size of the table and then you eat. And of course you get cheesecake because, we-hell, it's the CHEESECAKE factory, you idiot. That's what you get there!  So why did I just eat that super mega seared wasabi ahi tuna salad with the two dressings the apropros-of-nothing rice cracker shavings and also the fried macaroni and cheese appetizer? And why did I suck down the mojito again? Right! In preparation for cheesecake.  We didn't have to wait last night because a friend got there early (she loves this place, by the way. I'm just a hater.) and snagged a bar table. I'd never been to this location, but it's the same as the other two, in Rockville and Atlanta, that I've been to.  The food was ok. The waitress was extremely annoying, high-maintenance and rushy-rushy and snapping up the dishes while you were still eating, that sort of thing. But if I worked in this place I'd need Xanax cheesecake so I kind of feel for her.  Vanilla bean cheesecake was ok. White chocolate raspberry truffle was my favorite for a long time. I always, always feel like I should have just eaten dessert when I come here, and having done this before I think that's the ticket. Eat somewhere more sane - like home, maybe? - where the entrees aren't the size of a garbage-can lid, and go for cheesecake and maybe a coffee drink in the bar. Do not do the whole dinner ordeal. There are so many better places to do this.  My final irksome tidbit is the inclusion on the menu of a section of ""Weight Management Salads."" Hi 1954 . May I have some spiced apple rings and cottage cheese, too? You specialize in the fattiest dessert in the world besides eating cake icing out of the container (what what?) and you're not only going to give me three allegedly more sensible dining options, you're actually going to CALL THEM WEIGHT MANAGEMENT SALADS and make me order them that way? (And I don't mean me. The day I utter those words to a server is the day I ought to be spoon fed at home.) It really bothered me.

Nate H.,"Palm Springs, CA",339,496,392,5.0,6/12/2009,"I rarely review a chain, or even care to visit unless there is no other option, and last night, there was very little other options for a meal after a concert at Merriweather Post at 10:45pm. (BTW, Earth Wind and Fire rocked). We called from the car to make sure they were open.  They said as long as we get to a table and order before 11pm, we were good.  We booked, and made it. Now, this is the time you would expect the worst service, attitude and food, right?  Au contraire, mes amis!  The entire staff could not have been nicer. They asked about the concert, the waiter was nice, and professional, made conversation, everything was like clockwork - and we were pretty much the ONLY table in this huge, usually busy place. This Cheesecake Factory has to be one of the more impressive spaces I have seen in the chain - and I've been to many of them from Chicago, to Florida, and the one in Bethesda.  This one reminded me of the lobby of the Venetian Hotel in Vegas...just over the top, high design, spacious, down right beautiful. The food - perfect for this chain.  Fresh, huge portions.  One guest started with the ceasar salad - I've never seen such a mound!  Had to be 2000 calories right there.  The menu seems to favor the chinese thing alot - a whole page.  So I got the Orange chicken.  Simple, huge chunks of tasty white meat with a tangy fresh orange glaze.  None of that heavy breading hiding a little turd of chicken part from other places. (there, I have finally said 'turd' in a review!) The whole table split the apple pie, carmel ice cream thingy just for kicks.  It was awesome, even though it was now midnight and we couldn't think of eating it all.  (damn, now today I want it) So, if you live around Columbia MD, you guys got it made.  If you only come up here for concerts at the Post, stop here before for a great meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=260

Recently the food service has gone down.  On my trip before this one I had a hair fried in with my onion rings. GROSS!!!!! The manager comped the meal I did not eat and my boyfriends meal. So we gave it another try. Today was worse. My boyfriend asked for an omelette. You could make your own from four ingredients. He spent some time explaining that all four. Ingredients should be cheese. Secondly, he asked for a steak to be added to his meal. Interestingly the waitress interpreted that to mean a steak added to the omelet even though he asked for a steak and egg meal. Go figure. But it gets worse. They take the omelet back and try again. This time omelet came out with one ingredient instead of 4 helpings of cheese and the steak was lukewarm and cold in 5 minutes. The manager finally came by only to argue that rare steak should be lukewarm. Now we all know that your meat has to be a certain temperature to meet health standards. And this guy is telling us the meat is supposed to be lukewarm when served. This is our last trip to this Cheesecake Factory . And we were regulars.

In the past when I have been I can agree with the rest of the reviewers in saying the wait is generally insufferable, but yesterday we snuck in and got some prime bar seats. The bartenders were both very personable and helpful. They found time to talk fantasy football with us while still serving their other customers and manning the service bar. The drinks were well made. All of my friends and I enjoyed our meals and drinks. I ordered a new item called Chicken Bellagio. It was comprised of two thinly sliced, lightly breaded chicken breasts over a pesto pasta. the chicken breasts were then topped with prosciutto and arugula and a parmesan cream sauce. It was delicious and I was happy to find it because they have actually removed my old Cheesecake Facrtory favorite from the menu. If you are looking for a good appetizer, try their Buffalo Blasts. This appetizer is made up of shreded chicken stuffed inside a fried shell.  Overall, this Cheesecake Factory did a great job in making my dining experience enjoyable.

Jody Z.,"Columbia, MD",173,218,30,3.0,4/24/2009,"I've been to a lot of different Cheesecake Factory restaurants and I think it's the best chain restaurant for consistently good food.  I'm not normally a big fan of chains.  However, the food at the one in Columbia tastes just like the one in Baltimore, in DC, in Boston, etc.  You know what you're going to get and I like that.  They also excel at mastering a bunch of different cuisines---Mexican, America, Italian, etc---there is something for everyone.  I've never disliked anything on the menu and I've tried salads, sandwiches, burgers, pasta entrees, and of course cheesecake! You've probably heard that the portions are huge and that's true.  Expect leftovers or split one appetizer, one entree, and a dessert with a friend.  Some half portions are available at lunch and I wish they offered these at dinner time too.  It's pricier than most chains, I think, but not outrageous.  I think the drinks are too overpriced though. My main reason for the lower rating is that this particular Cheesecake Factory is always a mob scene!  There is ALWAYS a huge wait.  It's not their fault, but you should be warned before you go there.  Expect a 1.5-2 hour wait unless you visit at a really off time.  Try to snag some of the seat yourself tables by the bar if you can.  Warning though---If you do this, the other ""vultures"" will be stalking you and waiting until the second you start to get up to snag your table.  This can be kind of annoying. I've given up visiting the actual restaurant and have started doing Curbside To Go.  Call it in and they bring it right out to your car.  You get the yummy bread too.  It's saves me money because I usually order a $2.50 Diet Coke---what a rip off!  Then I eat my meal at home, in peace without the noise of 100 people jammed into the entryway or being stared down by the vultures trying to take my seat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=260

We were not greeted politely by the reservation desk personnel, they just looked and blinked at us without asking what we needed.  It was around 3 p.m., and the place was not that crowded, yet we were seated in a crummy corner near the kitchen. The waitress took forever to come over. She was curt, polite, but not very attentive and I had to beg for water and wait for her to be near to ask for another napkin.  The biggest disappointment and I was shocked about this one: the food.  I ordered the meatloaf which comes with mashed potatoes and succotash. The meatoaf was not tasty and had a huge amount of filler/bread so the texture was weird, potatoes were bland and too lumpy even for the rustic type, the succotash was fine, at least the corn was fresh. My friend's food was mediocre and we were very disappointed in what we thought would be a delicious meal.  My son's cheesecake was just not tasty at all. It might have been that they changed distributors and are cutting corners in terms of quality of ingredients, or maybe the cooks are not cooking the food correctly, or both---whatever the reason TCF has truly gone down the tubes.

The portions are huge and the food really isn't all that good. The front hostesses are so sassy and rude too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=160
Sandy P.,"Baltimore, MD",19,26,3,2.0,12/14/2013,"The SkinnyLicious Menu is a SHAM!!! The Cheesecake Factory used to be such a special treat to enjoy every now and then.  Especially, after going to the movies or shopping at the mall.  When I started eating more healthy, I was so glad to hear about their SkinnyLicious Menu.  What a total sham!  The selections on the SkinnyLicious Menu are just has greasy as regular entrees.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken and asked for steamed vegetables on the side with NO added oil or butter... Both came out to the table drenched in oil and butter.  What a HUGE disappointment!  I had to send it back.  I guess if you're going to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, there are NO healthy options, although they make that claim with their SkinnyLicious Menu. Also, the customer service by some of the wait staff is sometimes good, but the past few times I visited it was terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=160
Sunshine B.,"Elkridge, MD",9,62,18,4.0,4/24/2015,So good. The best thing about the meal was knowing that the dessert would phenomenal. My husband got the gumbo. His only wish was that they used jasmine rice instead of white. I had the carbonara. I'm perfectly pleased. Lemon meringue cheesecake!  Best think on earth. Very pleased. My only complaint was that the music was WAY too loud. I couldn't hear myself think and the people sitting beside us were yelling over the music all night which was annoying. It was too loud to have any kind of decent conversation.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=160
Carlie W.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,2,,1.0,12/24/2014,Ordered a cheesecake for the holidays and they gave me the wrong one. When I called to let them know they acted like they had no record of the transaction in their system and made it very difficult to return. Never using them again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbia?start=160
