Ryan C.,"Morral, OH",61,101,67,5.0,8/4/2017,"Fantastic. Absolutely reeks of quality, outstanding service, and value.  One of the better meals I have had in a while.  Coupled with outstanding service, this was a win.  I don't often leave a five-star review, but this one was earned. The food was perfect, the atmosphere was great.  Resulting in, a wonderful evening. You will not be disappointed to dine here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2
Misty H.,"Martinsburg, WV",0,34,13,2.0,11/11/2017,"Go for the cheesecake and eat dinner elsewhere. Food was mediocre. Our food arrived about 15 minutes apart so we were eating at different times. The milkshake was just milk with Oreos smashed (it was warm so the ice cream was completely melted). Overall, for the price there are many other options to get better food in Columbus. The cheesecake isn't really worth the long wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2
Robert S.,"Hilliard, OH",1,31,,1.0,11/5/2017,"This place is WAY overrated. I was hardly impressed. They should call this place The Sugar Factory I had dinner at a Japanese restaurant in the Polaris mall food court where I got a huge portion of food at a great price, I decided to come here for dessert. All I could taste in the two different cheesecakes I ordered were just huge amounts of sugar. The pieces of cheesecake I ordered were caramel pecan and some kind of truffle, they're supposed to be different from each other but tasted nearly exactly the same and each layer I bit into had hardly any difference in taste besides just tasting like different textures of sugar. I could hear my kidneys and liver shrieking in pain because of the sugar overload from each bite. This stuff is EXPENSIVE too! Totally not worth the money. they charge a fortune for just one piece of cheesecake, if it tasted amazing I wouldn't mind that, when I go to a grocery store though and buy a mass-produced piece of cheesecake for 1/5 of the cost it should NOT taste better than the one that costs a fortune that i ordered from this restaurant. One of the bakery staff had an attitude with me when I tried ordering too. I was standing in front of the bakery where there were two or three people working on the other side and I waited for someone to ask me if I needed help, I wasn't sure if this where I was supposed to order. No one asks me if I need anything after standing for a good moment. It seems like they assume people go out of their way to stare and admire their cheesecake in the bakery display like it's the Mona Lisa or something. I ask one of the women behind the counter if I can order cheesecake to go from the bakery counter and with an attitude she says ""she needs to help you"".  If you want a nice sit-down restaurant experience there are TONS of other options near by and if you want a great value for your money the food court in the mall has good options too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2
C K.,"Westerville, OH",0,14,10,5.0,1/12/2018,"The Cheesecake Factory outdoes themselves every time and this time is no exception. We Doordashed them while hanging out at Level One at Crosswoods. It arrived much sooner than expected, the warm food was still warm. If you are an avocado-file like me, you MUST try the Avocado Spring Rolls!! I don't know what the sauce is that comes with them, but it's REALLY good!!  The BaconBacon Burger was thoroughly enjoyed and of course the Oreo Cheesecake was the bomb. Thanks Cheesecake Factory!

Basima A.,"Washington, DC",175,66,163,4.0,8/3/2017,"My favorite book? The Cheesecake Factory menu.   When you're with your friends and your conversation transitions into the inevitable ""where do you want to go?"", ""I don't know, where do you want to go?""-- this is the place you go.   There isn't anything I find particularly special about their food (with the exception of their cheesecakes), other than the fact that there is literally something for everyone, and you'll never hate what you order.  It's incredibly consistent and you'll never leave hungry.  Like, ever.  The only thing you'll hate is deciding what to order because there are SO many options.   Also, portions.. WHO EATS THIS MUCH FOOD??  Each entree is large enough to feed a small village and then some.  Now, their cheesecake is above par, although I don't recall actually ever eating cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory, because there is simply no room left after dinner.  But I'm resourceful, so I always order it to goooo! And enjoy it as a midnight snack. Do make sure you eat the bread.  Always so warm and SO delicious.   Favorite apps:  1. avocado rolls- if you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out.  2. Calamari- perfectly crispy and so very tasty. 3. Warm crab and Artichoke dip- I could eat this all day, every day.   As for the entrees, I mean, I've never gotten anything I haven't liked, and as far as I'm concerned  neither will you!  My go-to is definitely the chicken Alfredo or the Thai salmon, both good.   If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night, make sure you call ahead and make a reservation. It tends to get quite crowded.  Give their Nutella cheesecake a try. It's pretty spectacular!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2

The ambience is same everywhere. It's nice and casual with food for everyone. It's a great place to sit down with your friends to eat after shopping. That's probably why every Cheesecake Factory is always packed with long lines, so always prepare to wait! I think they've expanded their menu since 5 years ago.

Stephanie L.,"Columbus, OH",64,31,6,4.0,11/9/2017,"I've always enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory and I was again very pleased with my cheesecake...the cafe au lait one this time. Delicious! The food was just ok (and I expect very good food from this restaurant). I will say the manager impressed me, I had originally ordered the cauliflower appetizer, and she came out to let me know the cauliflower was not up to par.

Bethany K.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",90,323,249,4.0,3/22/2017,"This is a solid Cheesecake Factory.  I have been here quite a few times, and haven't had any real issues.  The only actual complaint that I ever have is the wait times.   Other than that, I have had great meals and drinks here.  They get my order right every time. They can be considered on the more expensive side of things, but usually things around Polaris are.  So, use this as a celebration or special night out meal only if needed. Try the RED VELVET cheesecake!  Quite decedent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2
Lisa T.,"Morgantown, WV",0,48,,3.0,11/7/2017,"Everything here was great except for our initial encounter, which is why I can't give it more than three stars. The good - Our waitress was good. She was efficient. It was late and my kids were hungry. She could tell and got everything out ASAP. The food was good.  Cheesecake was obviously good.  The bad - As much as we liked our waitress, she couldn't get our wine bottle open. No big deal. My husband handled it, but then she just left the bottle on the table and didn't pour it. Again, no big deal, but not what you are really expecting. My son has a shellfish allergy. I asked right off what our options were. Waitress informed us that everything is made to order and his meal would be made on a separate grill, cooks would switch gloves and to order whatever we would like. Awesome! That was great. But, I have a sneaking suspicion that didn't actually happen. I'm not sure, but I just didn't get that feeling. Regardless, his meal was great so I can't comment more on that.  The worst part though was the banter between the hostesses. We had about a 20 minute wait to be seated. Now I get that this is in Ohio and they may not be used to the southern accent. But as we stood next to the hostess station and waited, a woman with a very southern accent came up and spoke to the hostess. The hostess immediately turned around and made fun of that woman with the other hostess. Very unprofessional. That really shouldn't happen. This lady wasn't rude or demanding. And she got made fun of right off the bat. And loud enough that I could hear it. Would it make me never go here again? No. But, it just didn't sit well. The staff should be better trained.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2

Joanna W.,"Columbus, OH",53,39,20,4.0,6/22/2017,I order from the skinny menu and my boyfriend gets the honey chicken or something from the pasta. I enjoy that the calories are printed in the menu so you know how many are in each product. The menu selection is plentiful and the service is okay. I tried the cheesecake once and it was very sweet so I made two desserts out of it. The wait is very long most of the times went (granted we eat during normal dinner hours so we expect it).

Kevin C.,"Columbus, OH",1391,247,1105,5.0,2/19/2016,"Birthday date night with my wife. We arrived Friday night about 6:50p and were seated at 7:35. This place was packed and super busy, but the service was top notch, and the staff were very attentive. It's somewhat dark which makes it a bit hard to see the menu, and the menu is 19 pages long! That's a bit overwhelming, however there are only about 4 pages that are specific for food and the rest is appetizers, desserts, and other things. Once we figured out the 2 pages that interested us we decided quickly on what to eat. I chose the Chicken Madeira which according to the menu was sauteed chicken breast topped with asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese, covered with fresh mushroom madeira sauce and a side of mashed potatoes.   This meal was very tasty and the portion size was rather large. I was able to take home half of my meal and have it for lunch the next day.   We shared the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple (Cheesecake with Caramel, peanut butter, Butterfinger and Reese's peanut butter cups).  What a wonderful piece of heaven this cheesecake was.   The food is very good and the portion sizes are very large, however the price for the meals and the cheesecake are also high.  I would like to see a place like this reduce the size of their meals, which would allow the price to come down as well.   We had a wonderful visit and enjoyed our date night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2

D S.,"Columbus, OH",0,32,7,1.0,10/9/2017,Had dinner there today.  Awful awful AWFUL food!! My son's chicken tenders were over-fried and there was more crispy batter than chicken in the tenders. I had the large chicken burrito.  BIG mistake!  It was full of plain white rice which was so undercooked that it was crunchy in my mouth! 75% of the burrito was filled with the hard white rice and it had no seasoning!  I think there were 2 tiny pieces of chicken in the entire large burrito!   I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in almost a decade and I definitely won't be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2
sharon s.,"Novato, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/14/2017,"My sister and I frequent the Cheesecake Factory as a tradition to celebrate our birthdays.  We were seated at 12:20pm in a section that was full of 2-top and 4-top tables. There was no indication, to us, that the entire left side of this section was all one group.  The waitress took our order in a timely manner, but after about 20 minutes, the wrong appetizer was delivered to our table. The correct appetizer didn't arrive until 1:15 - just 2-3 minutes before our main entrees were served.   We noticed that around 12:45, the waiters were yelling, ""Who had the...."" to the group of small tables, as they served their meals and realized the section was filled with a business group.    Once the group finished eating (at about the time we were being served), an awards meeting began.  The leader was standing right by my seat, (with her ""behind"" in my face) calling people up for awards, hugs, and photos.  This STOPPED the wait staff from checking on our table, and stopped our ability to hold a conversation.  The manager who said that she had already dealt with a previous problem regarding that group offered us a weak apology and a slice of cheesecake. Pathetic.  It looks like we'll find a new venue for our traditional birthday lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2
Leeanne B.,"New Philadelphia, OH",26,6,4,1.0,8/15/2017,"Very disappointing.

I took only 2 bites. my daughter had the Louisiana pasta... the chicken was good but the pasta was watery and bland , she only ate the chicken. my waiter was nice but never offered a substitute dish or comp. I would have at least expected that he offer to get the manager. I hate wasting money but that's exactly what I feel I did with my dish. and because they didn't try to make things right...

Craig R.,"Delaware, OH",6,11,,2.0,7/9/2017,"Since I don't believe in providing a 1- or 5-star review upon one visit to a restaurant, I'll refrain from doing so this time. However, if I were to do that, I'd grade my latest experience 1-star.  As far as the pros go, the menu is filled with so many options, no matter how picky one might be, he/she is bound to find something to their liking. The server was also quite friendly. In saying all of that, however, as I was in the mood for something ""Cajun"" and I stumbled upon a speciality dish called ""Cajun Chicken Littles,"" I ordered that and came away extremely disappointed. The dish is described on the menu as: ""Boneless Breast of Chicken Pieces, Spiced, Breaded and Fried Crisp..."" When I took my first bite, I could tell there was absolutely nothing ""Cajun"" about it and nothing ""little"" about it either. When the waitress returned, I asked for some Cajun seasoning, since it had appeared I was served two orders of regular chicken tenders with barbecue sauce on the side. When she returned, she said, ""I'm sorry, but this order isn't Cajun and isn't little. Here's some blackened seasoning. Hopefully that helps."" Really? A dish is called ""Cajun Chicken Littles"" and 2/3 of the title is inaccurate? If I had known the ""Cajun Chicken"" wasn't Cajun, I would have ordered something else. Not only that, but while I quickly lost my appetite and didn't eat much of the disappointing meal, I wasn't offered a discount for the slip-up.

While I sit there and watch I see servers are taking care of other guests who came after us but ignored us. Is it because of the color of my skin that made me treated the way I was treated? Or dose Cheescake factory dose not good customer service?

I have served and bartended for over 2.5 years so I completely understand what it is like and I'm not one to complain but tonight was unreal!!!!...I ordered a lettuce wrap with no chicken just fresh veggies and my boyfriend ordered a ribeye steak with mash potatoes and green beans...our food took over an hr to receive on a Wednesday night that was not busy by any means. We have been here on many weekends where our food never took this long..We got our food and my boyfriend only got his steak and green beans. I asked our server what took so long he said he was waiting on the mashed potatoes and didn't want to wait any longer so he brought out our food...which was fine. He said he would bring out the mashed potatoes as soon as they were done.....But of course By the time he was about done with his steak and green beans he THEN got his mash potatoes....mind you this was after waiting already an hour for our food. The manager brought it out and asked us if we were doing ok still, we said yes. He Did not even bother to apologize for the long wait nor did the server even bother to ask us if we wanted a salad or more bread as we were waiting for our food. We had to ASK him if we could have more bread!!!!....So ridiculous on both their parts.....How is it that The table that sat across from us arrived 20 minutes after we did and received their food before us ???

Service is also pretty good For some reason in summer it is ABSOLUTELY FREEZING inside, when it's hot and you wear tshirt and shorts you will most likely freeze in the first 10 minutes there.  In winter it is super cold, especially the waiting area. I'm not sure if it's just the building designed that way or they are trying to make customers feel uncomfortable so they can leave sooner and there would be more rotation.  I don't like being cold or waiting over an hour for a table and than another 40 minutes for my food to come out. Most possibly be back as the food is decent and desserts are good but it's not my favorite spot",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2?start=20

This time tonite was the worst. Being a Tuesday we thought it would be in and out. We sat down in a timely manner but everything else was super super slow. We waited about 10 minutes before our waiter came over. When he finally came we ordered our drinks and our food. The people next to us got their food right after we ordered. They ate, paid and left. Still no food for us. The waiter said it's coming about 3 times. Then the manager came and apologized and said it's coming. Then another couple sat down next to us. We finally got our food, about 50 minutes later. Meanwhile the couple next to us ate, paid and left before we got our check paid so we could leave. We assumed that after all that we would have some kind of comp on our bill. We did not. Then, to make things worse, I left my (very sentimental) birthday card on the booth seat when we got up. I realized when we were pulling out of the parking lot. I called to have them grab it and the hostess said no one has seen it. I spoke to a manager and she finally admitted that the buser saw it, said there was nothing in it so he threw it away. Super disappointed.

We arrived at 5:45pm to find the place overrun with Prom goers. While waiting to get to the reservation station, a group in front of us offered their buzzer as they were not going to wait the 90 minutes predicted by the hostess. We passed the buzzer to a party of four. After waiting 8 minutes we were escorted to our table. We ordered iced tea and pot-stickers. They arrived in a timely fashion and the pot-stickers were very good. Our waitress was superb and did not hover around, she gave us plenty of time to peruse the vast menu. The fetching Mrs. Rat ordered steak medallions with grilled spring vegetables. The presentation was pleasing to the eye and the food was tasty to the tongue. I had the steak Diane & salmon combination with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The steak was grilled to perfection. The salmon was a bit more done for my taste. I don't fault the cook though as I should have ordered it medium rare. We both ordered cheesecake and coffee to end the meal. I had traditional with cherry topping. The fetching Mrs. Rat had vanilla bean with strawberries on the side. I see that some reviews say that service was slow. We had no problems whatsoever.

The waiter failed to return to check on me until I was three-fourths done with the burger.  At which time I *finally* got to ask for the ketchup for the fries and pointed out there was a problem with the food.  I said I didn't want to send it back (it was far too late and the rest was okay), but that he really should alert the kitchen that they'd made a mistake.  I even picked up an onion skin strip and demonstrated that you could try to pull it apart but it was very strong and unchewable.  This should have set off alarm bells, but he said something like, ""oh, okay"" and left.  I would've expected a manager to drop by within minutes but that didn't happen, meaning he didn't tell anyone.  Which means that serving bad food wasn't taken seriously.  To be clear, I did not want any sort of comp - no free food or desserts.  I only wanted the business to know about the mistake, take quality seriously and take steps to correct it.  But that did not happen, so we're done with Cheesecake Factory.  I'm going to upload a pic - I think Yelp hooks that to my review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2?start=60

So we asked other staff to bring us plates, omg, one of the plate are so dirty!  Of course when the manager here, we have to tell him that, the manager explain why the bread took half and hour, because they are out and still in the oven?!

Wait time for a regular table was a half hour, however we were able to grab a high top right by the bar and were served right away. Started off our ""lunch"" with some fried crispy cheese.  The breading was a big thick which made the frying a little strong.  There was more fried breading than actual cheese, but it was still ""ok"". The cheese was a combo of two different types which was fairly tasty, just not much of it.  I had the cheeseburger, can't remember the exact name just remember that it was charbroiled and had cheddar. The burger was not a typical ""burger"" per say, it was served on a partial loaf...baguette size. The burger was rather tasty and well cooked. Great flavor in the burger without drying it out, still a good amount of juice in the burger. The fries were very tasty and not overly salted. Just the right amount of crisp, salty, and moist.  The better half had the salmon. He enjoyed the salmon itself, didn't really care for the sides. The broccoli, as he reports, was cold so he didn't really eat any of it. His other side was mashed potatoes, he ate some of those but he's not a huge mashed potato fan. Service was quick and very pleasant.

The reason why I would come here....in the past. I was SO disappointed in my cheesecake. All 5 of us got something different and I got the tiramasu. Love cheesecake and tiramasu so I thought this would be perfect. My piece, for $8,50 was tiny and everyone even commented on that. To say it was 1/2 the size of the others would be pushing it. TINY! Also, I miss the crust on this cheesecake like the others had. Also, def. more tiramasu than cheesecake. And the whip cream is so nasty, def. couldn't get that down.

Then this is the place for you!  For those of you unfamiliar with Norovirus, it is basically an ""oral-fecal"" illness that derives from poor sanitation combined with food handling. Now I'm no expert, but with some information from the Columbus & Morrow County health departments & some research on my end, I've become very familiar.  You see, I was the first of a handful of people to be afflicted with said Norovirus through the Cheesecake Factory of Polaris. Thankfully some of us came forward & reported it to the health department & they are taking it very seriously. I didn't know this was possible, so next time you suspect you've been contaminated by a restaurant, give them a call. Don't expect it to end there though folks, as they need to be able to prove your food-borne illness came from that particular restaurant, so if you are willing (& I was, as this was my VERY EXPENSIVE birthday dinner), they will ask that you submit stool samples. Specific stool samples. Embarrassing? Yup. But we have a baby, so poop is something I'm a little accustomed to, unfortunately. Anyhow, I digress. My husband was so excited to take me out for a nice birthday dinner.  We just moved here & I've never been to any Cheesecake Factory, so I was stoked! The service? It was good! Our food?

Ali H.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",18,37,,2.0,6/13/2014,"First time to this location, sadly will be the last.  We were a party of 7. 5 adults and 2 kids celebrating a families birthday.  We were seated and greeted promptly but the good ended there.  Our food 50 minutes to arrive. Whrn it did 2 people received their food.  No mention or recognition from the server as the people all around us who were seated after us were served.  About 10 minutes later 2 more plates came.  5 more minutes and the final plate and kids meal arrived.This kids pizza was so hot and the cashew chicken looked like someones reheated burnt leftovers, with no cashews.  All of the requests were forgotten such as no tomatoes, add cheese on a burger.  The manager came out and looked embarrassed by what the cashew chicken looked like and offered to replace but they were out of cashews and as we were already there over an hour we declined. He took care of the dish but the whole experience was lack luster. None of us ordered  dessert bc we were just over the whole experience.  Hope you get it together Cheesecake, reminded me of Applebee's....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2?start=100

T F.,"San Diego, CA",1,57,,2.0,8/13/2014,"We arrive - we are seated in the patio because the inside of the restaurant is just too cold.  The person who greeted us (ended up being the manager) was pleasant.  She seated us. So I am there with my beau...we are waiting.  It takes like 10 minutes for our waiter to come...his name is Kerrod (very rude and unfriendly & his work uniform was dirty which makes me concerned for him to handle my food).  So we only ask for water & a glass of wine...it takes him almost another 15 minutes to bring that back to our table - there are at least 5 other parties that sit down and he barely comes back.  My boyfriend asked him were we allotted bread.  His response ""oh yea, I guess I can bring it....""....so we wait.  Then he takes our order.  My boyfriend has never been here so he is asking questions.  Kerrod seemed annoyed and he ended up placing our order.  I got a salad and my boyfriend ordered a burger.  Others are sat down and we still don't have our food.  I am getting annoyed so we decide to leave.  The manager (Allison) comes over and asks us what's the problem.  I tell her about the food and service...oh did I mention our waiter came out with sunglasses on??  Weird....so we are about to leave.  She rushes and gets our food and gives it to us on the house.  We wait almost an hour and my boyfriend's burger was cold...maybe because it was sitting in back the whole time.  I was so annoyed I  left my food.  Allison tried to accommodate us.  She gave us a gift card which was nice, but dang, did we have to go thru such drastic measures?  Our waiter had a crappy attitude from the word go....so he ruined my boyfriend's first experience at the factory...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2?start=100
Katherine B.,"Hilliard, OH",64,75,10,3.0,8/9/2010,"My husband and I visited the Cheesecake Factory for the first time this past Saturday night.  We found a $25.00 gift card that we had received for a gift a while back and forgotten about, so it was an unexpected treat. My first thought upon walking in was how noisy the place was.  One traverses a rather long hallway when entering from the parking lot, and you are unable to see the interior of the restaurant...but boy could you hear it!!  It didn't seem so bad when we got in there, but we did opt to eat outside on the patio, somewhat unusual for us. The server was terrific.  He was attentive enough, but not overly so...I hate it when they hand around.  He did warn us about the size of the entrees, and that was very much appreciated.  He was also  ready with answers about entrees and opinions about which he liked better.  I KNOW I might  not like what the server likes, but when I ask them what they like, it's nice when they've actually sampled the items on the menus enough to have preferences!! I ordered the barbecued salmon.  It came with smashed potatoes, onion rings, and corn succotash.  The salmon was fine, cooked okay, but rather ordinary.  So were the potatoes and onions rings...pretty much what you'd expect and a thousand other restaurants.  They weren't hot...so that's a ding.  The corn succotash was delicious...I was expecting corn with lima beans or green beans.  No!!  It was full of cubed zucchini and yellow squash and tasted hot and fresh. My husband had a steak, cooked medium rare, which came with two enormous batter fried onion rings and french fries.  Wayyyyy too many french fries, and not very good at that--not too hot and not too crispy.  His steak was cooked perfectly, though, and the onion rings were much better than the stringy kind that came with my salmon (I know cuz I stole one when he wasn't looking).   I had to pack up half of my meal...and I noticed many other diners had to do the same.  I still felt like I needed to be rolled out, so even cheesecake ""to go"" was not an option for me.  My husband had a piece of carrot cake cheesecake packed up.  He ate it later that evening and pronounced it delicious. All in all, though, the overall experience was just okay.  About what I would expect from a much closer to my house Max & Erma's, Fridays, or Applebee's, but it seemed more expensive.  I was glad we had the gift card.  I'd eat there again if I were in a group and it was a group decision but probably wouldn't choose it over many other venues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2?start=100

Elizabeth B.,"Philadelphia, PA",149,235,14,2.0,1/1/2010,"Made a quick pit stop at Cheesecake Factory to meet a friend for coffee. There are probably better places to do this, but it was in the middle of a snowstorm and it was conveniently located.  Seated quickly in the bar area, we told the waiter we wouldn't be ordering food or alcohol, just a hot chocolate for her and a latte for me. He didn't seem too pleased, but by the end of the night I realized that this was just his demeanor. He didn't crack a smile the entire time, no matter how charming or friendly we were (and we really were).  The drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive. When they did, the waiter said there was a microwave mishap. A microwave? Seriously? This is a real restaurant, serving real food. Microwaves should not involved.  I waited another 10 minutes or so until I could get his attention to ask for sugar and a spoon or stirring device. While we were waiting, a tray of empty glasses flew out of a server's hand and went flying everywhere. It was cleaned up quickly, which was nice, but the floor was so slippery afterward that it was kind of perilous. Come to think of it, it was probably slippery anyway which caused the spill in the first place. The latte was fine ... my friend said her hot choc tasted like Swiss Miss.  I haven't eaten real food at Cheesecake Factory in some time (though I remember it being tasty, about oh .... 8 years ago) but I won't return for coffee, no sir! I have learned my lesson.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2?start=120

Jeff A.,"Chicago, IL",1166,309,7,4.0,8/7/2009,"I tour the country for my job, my favorite chain of restaurants for group dining is cheesecake factory without a doubt!   I ate at this one last year right after it opened and gain this year just a couple days ago, and the service is on point and the atmosphere is just phenomenal, of-course this is the case at most Cheesecake Factories... I tried a few of the small plates from the new special menu, leave it to Cheesecake factory to make an already great menu even better! I had one of the small plate mushroom pizettes it was just wonderful!  Crisp thin crust, copious amounts of mushrooms, and perfect flavors of herbs and cheese wonderfulness!  I also had the Ahi tuna Tar Tar with avocado salad it was great (It could have had more tuna) the flavor was rich yet delicate the consistency was great and it had these really naughty fresh fries flour tortilla chips to scoop it on, another winner!  I also had a salad that was not on the menu it all it was heavily salted and peppered arugula with raisins and nuts and happiness all about the salt quotient was almost overwhelming and i suspect for many it would have been but I still really liked it!   The table also split some bacon wrapped cheese stuffed dates and they were amazing! HMMMMMMM We also split a piece of Lemon Raspberry cheesecake this is one of my favorites and it is always good!

Bee S.,"Cleveland, OH",64,211,98,4.0,8/29/2011,"I ate once at a Cheesecake Factory long ago and was so unimpressed and disgusted at the never ate at one again apart from running in and grabbing a piece of cheesecake to go every now and then. But just recently dined here with 9 coworkers. I really just went to be polite, but ended up having a great time! I was incredibly impressed with our service. The waiter we had was amazing, he was so attentive even with our large party, and he was super polite and checked on us just enough to make sure everything was going well the entire night.  I also like how they now have a ""skinnylicious"" menu, completely separate from the main menu. It takes all of the regular menu items (and a few new items I think) and combine them all in one little separate menu with items ranging in calorie content, but nothing over 600 calories, if I remember correctly. It was really convenient, especially since I've always been wary of their meals after reading all the horror stories about how they notoriously have 1000+ calorie dishes and don't post their nutrition info. And they don't skimp on the portions either, they are just healthier options at the same prices!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2?start=120

My chicken romano was good as always & she very much enjoyed her fettucini alfredo.  The fiance got the meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  He said the meatloaf was good, but the mashed potatoes were not so great.  I love mashed potatoes so I stole a bite.  I found them worse than the usual instant mashed potatoes you find at restaurants - dry & hard once they were stuck in their sand-castle mold.  We finished our dinner & on to the real reason we came: cheesecake.   The fiance had been salivating over the new Hershey's cheesecake.  Well, too bad because they were out of it.  They were also out of some soup earlier in the evening.  We mentioned that the Hershey's cheesecake was the reason we came there that evening & our waiter said nothing.  I pointed out that their name is the cheesecake FACTORY - make some more.  Then our waiter had the gall to say the BAKERY (again implying they could produce more cheesecake not run out of it for the evening) was busy & we would have to wait approximately 15 minutes for our cheesecake.  The fiance settled on Godiva & his sister & I shared the tiramasu cheesecake.  I like tiramasu, I like cheesecake, so I thought I would love it.  But it was the first time I have ever not liked a slice from the Cheesecake Factory.  It was dry and boring.  Well we will go back to try the Hershey's cheescake, but will not waste our time or money with eating dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-columbus-2?start=120
