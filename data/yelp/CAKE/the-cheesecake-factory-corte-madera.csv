Mike K.,"Novato, CA",164,108,56,4.0,11/28/2017,"Seriously? A four-star review of a cheesy chain restaurant? Well, in this case, yes indeed. We had a couple of occasions to be in Corte Madera around lunchtime this fall, and ended up one time at The Factory. Well, of course I always am leery about a place with 3,000+ calorie meal options, but there it was in the middle of the menu book, SALADS! Actual healthy salad options. I went for Chinese chicken salad, the small one please with dressing on the side. It was surprisingly good, with crisp greens and noodles, lean chicken, and herbed just to my liking!  While perusing the menu I also discovered several other items for non-gluttons, including sandwich and dinner plate options that were not overly carbiferous. My wife and daughter loved their entree (enough for two) and we seemed to be in some kind of time warp as we were served our drinks almost as soon as we sat down and our lunch in what seemed like just a few minutes... a lot faster then I remember for Cheesecake Factory. Maybe it's just this location. Maybe they have to bring it up a notch for the fussy Main crowd. I don't know. I do know I'll try them again and let you all know if this was just a fluke. In any case, as of today, I'm a fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera
Sara S.,"Novato, CA",28,58,90,4.0,11/22/2017,"I don't know if I put review for Cheesecake Factory before or not! I am going to make it short and general! First of all, It was nice that we didn't have to wait for a long time to get a table although it was a busy day as usual!  The service was okay not good, but in Cheesecake Factory, the food never satisfied me... I have been in this place several times, but I feel like the food doesn't have the quality! For Cheesecake Factory, as a big chain restaurant, people are expecting a better quality!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera
Oren H.,"San Francisco, CA",136,10,,1.0,11/6/2017,"How can it be possible that this place is still open? To be quite honest I try to not be negative and write bad reviews and I am always the person fighting to give servers larger tips but this may top one of the lesser experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I came into the restaurant, was seated right away because it was a very slow night (probably for good reason - others know what I did not). My server came over - seemed very nice - I placed my order and then that is where the fun starts. For the next 35 minutes (and I know it was this long because I made a call right after I ordered so I checked what the time was when I made the call) on a slow night, I did not see my server, my food, nada. Glass was empty. I had to get out of my seat to go ask another waitress to see if she could help find my server and my food. She comes back a few minutes later to tell me they burnt it so they are remaking the dish.  My server finally shows up with the food and asked me ""how do those look?"" I responded ""they look fine it's the first I have seen them"". She said she had them remake them because the first order was burnt. By the way they were the Cajun Chicken Littles. I greatly appreciate that they remade my order but I am not sure I need to be grateful that the process took 35 minutes when the restaurant was dead and it was their mistake. No manager ever came over to discuss what happened (the waitress that went to solve the riddle earlier implied one might). No apology for the long wait time was vet made. Still glass is empty. Finally some water arrives. Hallelujah.  I finish my meal and then the bill comes. Not only was there no considerations for the 40 minutes of my life that was wasted but the charge was even more than the menu price. I asked if I could swap mashed potatoes for asparagus. Reply ""Sure no problem"".  The bill had a $4 additional charge which was never mentioned. Moral of this whole story is I have no idea why I didn't ask for a manager. I have no idea why I left even a penny for a tip but left a tip (reduced but nonetheless) and I am writing this to warn everyone that the way this place is being run is absolute dog s*^%. There are plenty of amazing restaurants with great service so don't waste your precious hours walking through the doors of this sadly run establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera
Sheila C.,"Miami Beach, FL",81,1,,1.0,1/13/2018,"Absolutely disappointed in the service here. Me and my boyfriend love Cheesecake Factory and we decided to grab dinner at this location tonight. When we came in we put our names in and they told us that it would be about 20 minutes. About 35 minuets later our buzzer finally went off and we turned it in to the hostess and waited for her to bring us to our table. Not only did they never bring us to our table after turning our buzzer in, they proceeded to seat many other people. Within the next 20 minutes after, we checked in with them again to see what was taking so long and they had no record of our names and tried telling us that that we hadn't even put our names in, making it seem like it was our fault. We looked passed this and they then told us that we would be first on the list, alas that was not true either considering we waited another 20 minutes and did not get seated... We decided to leave and now are on our way to another restaurant. UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED. Honestly, they undoubtedly lost two customers tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera
Laura D.,"Napa, CA",2,33,80,4.0,7/6/2017,"CAN I GET SALT ALL AROUND THAT RIM RIM RIM RIM Just kidding it was sugar. I ordered a strawberry lemonade that I would order again because it was so fresh. I was a little sick when I went here to celebrate graduating Junior College so I couldn't enjoy my food so much before I felt too sick to eat. I ordered a soup and salad combo to keep it more on the healthy side. The salad was simple but EXCELLENT. It was so flavorful with the ranch dressing I ordered and so fresh. I ordered a soup on the side which was a cream of chicken but it had vegetables in it like peas, carrots and artichokes. I can tell there were more artichokes than anything but that's okay since I liked the taste. Would come here again! Hopefully when I'm not sick and can enjoy food the way I like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera

I will give it a try again.    At the restaurant itself, we had two managers come to our table and I did end up contacting CF corporate afterwards, Their customer service has been professional and I feel like our frustrations and concerns were heard.   I did have the lemon cheesecake and it was as very good.  The meringue was sweet and I liked the texture.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera

Wendy C.,"Napa, CA",23,218,310,1.0,5/29/2017,"Long wait for service. We thought going to the bar area would be faster but maybe regular table would have been faster!  The water glass had lipstick on it.  That was the first of many red flags. The spoon, knife were not clean.  When the nice server brought back the new water glass it had something at the bottom that was scary looking not sure if it was a bug or what??? The manager Emily came out and apologized but when the server brought another glass of water it had something on the outside!! What a calamity.  We decided that we did not trust the food and walked out.  The first time I've ever done that in my life.

Calvin P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4,3,,3.0,1/9/2018,"Went to the cheesecake factory with some friends last week. I ordered the Chicken Stuffed Tortillas.  The order comes with the tacos, corn cakes, and black beans. The Chicken Stuffed Tortillas themselves were good - not great but good.  For some reason both the black beans and the corn cakes were just lousy.   I had a mojito which made the whole evening feel good so overall I was happy.

Nathan S.,"Novato, CA",91,24,,3.0,1/8/2018,"Walking in you get the standard chain restaurant.  We were seated quickly and got our drinks.  The waiters looked understaffed and it took awhile to get our order in and out on our table.   Light was a bit too dim and the music was a bit too loud even for my young ears. The food is what we expected: burgers, pastas, pizza, etc. nothing spectacular, but very convenient.  There isn't a dish I would say ""you must stay away from.""  Their cheesecake game IS on point though.  That never a bad order, course it is on the priced side. I've been here several times because of convenience, not because it was super great. There are times service is awesome, the food is terrible, and vise versa. Advice: workin on consistency would be the first thing to do.  The rest will kinda fall into place when that's addressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera

Joanna C.,"Seattle, WA",142,88,189,4.0,1/19/2017,"Cheesecake Factory, yay! My first visit in SF.  - Free bread: is always a highlight at any restaurant, who am I kidding XD The brown bread is much softer with a hint of sweetness (and much better) than the white bread. I definitely ate too much bread before all the food came :P - Louisiana chicken pasta: such a giant portion, definitely enough for 2.  - Strawberry cheesecake: I've never tried it before, but I guess it's a favourite on their menu for good reason! It was really delicious, and not too sweet (at least, compared to some of the other ultra chocolatey flavours I've tried in the past lol), so I'll definitely be ordering this one again soon :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera
Jason K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",10,53,69,3.0,11/7/2017,This place is the typical overpriced chain restaurant. It's decent food but try the upscale approach in order to charge more.

But the manager on duty was so rude and doesn't know customer service at all. It's lunch time and the restaurant was not busy at the time. Our waitress was busy running around, due to a call out. So we flagged the manager down, to take our order. We asked the manager to have the food be brought out all at once when we ordered. About 20 minutes later he brings my nieces nachos. We are still waiting for our food. Once a hour wait hits, we asked for our food to go. Called the manager back over, and all he was good for, was to argue with us and lie about what the situation was. He would not give us a name of someone above him, with the worst attitude ever.

Destinee Y.,"Davis, CA",52,13,5,2.0,3/6/2017,"I came to this location at dinner for a friends birthday hoping to have a nice and fun night and unfortunately our whole group left extremely disappointed.  I have a relatively long list of issues I had while there so I'll just start from the beginning.  Firstly we were seated at a dirty table that took waayyy too long after we were seated to be cleared. Our server Hannah H finally brought us bread and DIRTY plates said she would be back to take our drink orders and then disappeared for a good 20 minutes, long story short she took the dirty plates back and never brought new ones out. We got the mac and cheese balls and a side of asparagus as an appetizer. SIDENOTE the asparagus side was $6.95 for 5 soggy unseasoned cold pieces of asparagus... what. It was an hour and a half after we arrived that we finally got our food. The appetizers (cold) came with the main dishes -- the plates were obviously sitting under a warmer forever before being brought out to us. I ordered a burger with a side salad, and didn't receive the salad until after myself and everyone else in my group was done with our entrees, keep in mind the salad was literally just spring mix drenched in balsamic vinaigrette. Our water cups were only refilled once after being directly asked for a refill. Overall it was just a really lame experience, we were so so neglected which is totally unacceptable. Hopefully this can be taken constructively and changes can be made to ensure better service in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=80

I couldn't believe it, I've NEVER seen it served like this EVER and I've been to at least 8+ different cities and this was the absolute worst.

Lizette R.,"Sonoma, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/7/2017,"I have been here MULTIPLE times over the years and I have NEVER had a bad experience until today. If I could give their manager and Michelle zero stars I would. We got here at 4:30 pm and we did not get out until 7:15...WHY?? Because apparently they had just changed their menu and ""the kitchen was having a hard time with it"". There were seven of us, and two of us didn't even get our food until everybody else was done eating. One of the late plates came with white rice that was absolutely dry....how you mess up steamed rice is beyond me but whatever. It happened. This wasn't even the worst part. Our server, Michelle, was absolutely flustered. She just could not handle her work and it was showing and we weren't even that needy of a table, but she only refilled our waters twice in the TWO HOURS AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES we were forced to endure her service.  Anybody would become annoyed by waiting for so long to just receive food and the check. We were pissed especially after a long day in the city. When the checks came, she messed it ALL up. Again, how she did it was beyond me. We had three tags already separated And we had all put our cards down with the correct receipts, but when she came back they were all completely swapped and some of us paid more than we even had to. I understand splitting tags is hard. Ok. But She didn't even apologize for all the inconvenience. She managed to blame the kitchen for late food and get pissed at the fact that we were beyond annoyed with the service. She was rude to us as if we were the inconvenience!!! After speaking to Luis, the manager TWICE he said the best he could do was comp dessert.....of all the things he could of done he thought that was his best option?? Not even a coupon to return not even a free meal that was over 45-minutes late, not even an apology!! This was absurd. Absolute WORST service I have ever experienced here, and let me reiterate that it has never, never, never, been this terrible. It wasn't even busy when we arrived and because of there inability to provide good customer service, we had a great day ruined by a terrible attitude and a manager who can barely manage. Obviously I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=80

We arrived here on a Sunday night a little after 8pm. We had a 10 minute wait and was seated with Michelle. This older loving gal was fantastic! Super jazzed to be working there, went over some of her favorites and was fantastic on refills! We loved her! She knew that menu very well! We went with the Shepard's Pie, which my husband says was fantastic! I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club, it did not disappoint. Bacon was crispy and avocado was fresh!! I had the Flavored Iced Tea and it was amazing. I must of had 3 refills from poor Michelle. But she had a smile the whole time!! When it came to dessert we really couldn't decide, so we went with 3 slices of Cheesecake! We ordered the Snickers, Reese's and finally the Banana Cream. OMG all were fantastic but my favorite was the Banana Cream, best I have ever had. I can't wait to go back and try more! This place rocks! Thanks for Michelle for your awesome service! The only thing I would say that needs better attention was the bathroom, it was dirty. Toliet paper, paper towels and seat covers all over. It had rusty hinges  on the doors, it needs to be looked at ASAP. If I had gone to the bathroom first I may not have eaten there. That's the only reason they are getting 4 stars and not 5. I did let the front desk know and they said they will take care of it and that they were sorry. Which was nice. I watched one of the hostesses walk to the restroom very briskly after my comment.

I got the steak diane ($20) that had a flavorful mushroom sauce and creamy mashed potatoes. I wasn't as big of a fan of the steak. For dessert I got the lemon meringue cheesecake ($7).

With that said, the overall culinary experience was great! The staff and customer service throughout our experience were all wonderful, but our server Scott stood above them all.

Jeannie T.,"Oakland, CA",90,226,915,4.0,2/9/2016,"Came by to eat at the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I came with a group of 7 people. It wasn't as busy since it was a Monday so we only had to wait a few minutes for them to push some tables together for us. Our server, I believe his name was Theo, was on the younger side so it was easy for our table to joke around with him. We started with the fried calamari, avocado eggrolls, firecracker salmon, and buffalo wings. The fried clamari is always good, especially when they serve them with the tentacles, my favorite part. It had a light batter and was cooked well. The avocado eggrolls are also a must. I prefer the avocado eggrolls from Cheesecake Factory over the ones from CPK. The perfect amount of avocado with bits of sun-dried tomato, red onion, and cilantro, perfectly fried up in a crisp wrapper. It comes with a tamarind cashew dipping sauce. Kinda weird but when paired together, it works. The firecracker salmon was a new appetizer that I'd never tried. It's salmon rolled in spinach and fried in a crisp wrapper. I thought it was pretty good. And the buffalo wings had a nice crunch. It had nice meaty pieces but wasn't overly dry. The crust wasn't too heavy and it was executed well. The crust stayed put with the chicken when you bit into it. Definitely my kind of chicken wing, though I'm more of drumstick person. As far as entrees go, I really should've shared a dish because I was so full just from the appetizers, but I ended up with the Chinese chicken salad and my boyfriend got the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. The Chinese chicken salad is literally my go to dish whenever I venture out to the Cheesecake Factory. It never disappoints and I love the dressing. It's the perfect a amount of tang with a crunch from the rice noodles, almonds, and crisp wontons.  I also tried the Farfalle that my boyfriend ordered. It's actually really good. It's bow-tie pasta with chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas, and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce. The roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce was what made the dish perfect. But the cream sauce is a bit on the heavy side, so it's difficult to take in if you've already downed 2 mai tai's like my boyfriend and guy friends were doing. Especially before you've even eaten anything. So we ended up taking that to go.  For dessert, we asked Theo to surprise us because everything looked so good and we couldn't decide on which cheesecake to order. What came out was a s'mores cheesecake and it was the bomb. It was like a heaven on a plate with melted marshmallows, ice cream, and graham crackers. It's so good. You have to try it.  The only small tid bit that I had was that the bread was a bit hard when they brought it out. Almost as if they gave us leftover bread that had been sitting out but was just warmed up to hide the fact that it wasn't fresh. But all of our appetizers made up for it. So it wasn't that big of a deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=80

We never got the side salad or the sides that were supposed to come with the burrito. We asked for bread twice only got one. On top of this our waiter made some excuse about how the kitchen never tells customers what they don't have and other sites are better.

Madelyn A.,"Cotati, CA",9,53,2,5.0,9/9/2017,"My review is for our amazing waiter, Scott. He's been my server a few times over the years and had I known his name before our most recent visit, I would have written this review sooner.  Scott is ALWAYS on top of it with refilling water, which is always a great thing when I'm at a restaurant because I love to drink ice cold water and seem overindulge on it. He's attentive -- greeting us as we sit down, taking our order, bread, a plate of strawberries for our toddler, etc. He jokes -- I asked for no egg in my salad. So, when he's repeating back our order to confirm, Scott jokingly said I asked for extra egg  Our last visit Scott was amazing because we were daringly out to eat as a family with our newborn. He doted on her, telling us about his 2 kids. The baby started to get restless during dinner and he recognized that and helped us get our food boxed up as quickly as possible. We were getting cake to go bc it was our older daughter's birthday and he treated us to a dessert as a congratulations for the baby. Totally unexpected but such a nice gesture. Scott is hands down one of the best servers I've ever had and I really hope he gets recognized for his hard work.  I'll add, close to a couple of years ago I was out to dinner at Cheesecake with an old friend who is known to be high maintenance at restaurants. Scott was our server at the time. I'll never forget this meal because I was actually embarrassed by her behavior toward him. She had special requests with everything she ordered because of whatever diet she was on at the time and its restrictions. She wasn't considerate or appreciative toward him for his work to make sure her meal was correct. He very much went above and beyond to accommodate her. Long and short of this story, he was smiles and rainbows and didn't miss a beat while dealing with my difficult companion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=20

Tim B.,"Novato, CA",70,279,8,4.0,1/1/2017,"So one of our gifts for Christmas was $100 in gift cards for the Cheesecake Factory. I say two as the giver felt it necessary to split the $100 in two, just in case we wanted to split up and visit the chain on separate occasions. It's allright, it's ok... We wound up visiting just three days after the national holiday, arriving at about 5:30. Granted it was in the middle of that holiday week between Christmas and New Years, but the place was hoppin. Fortunately we were able to get a table quickly without a reservation, although there were a lot of larger groups waiting for a table. A taste of familiarity occurred when we realized the woman walking us to our table used to work at another restaurant we frequent. Upon this, she had our server 'treat us extra special'. That's nice - and to be fair he did check on us often, although all of that could have fallen by the wayside if they had just remembered to give us forks so that we didn't feel obligated to ask for them. Sidebar: Why is it that many restaurants don't seem to pay much attention to obvious details such as... silverware? Are they really paranoid about people stealing the semi-precious metal? As to the meal itself - well, one can never fault this chain for lack of choice. I enjoyed the Cajun pasta, washed down with a Lost Coast IPA, whereas the missus relished her falafel pasta and iced tea. Food came promptly and went down smoother than a Santana/Rob Thomas collaboration. Dessert was the Kahlua cheesecake, which was predictably sumptuous.  Entire bill came to a mere 67 smackers - considering that accounted for two people's meals, drinks and desserts, not too shabby.

Unfortunately for me, once I arrived at home I saw they scraped off the Bavarian cream and not the large mountain of whip cream on the cheesecake.

Darlene C.,"Napa, CA",23,164,105,1.0,7/17/2016,"RECOMMENDATION:  Definitely steer clear from THIS particular CF (usually a crowd-pleaser kind of staple when we can't decide what we want) - it is so poorly run, its really SAD.   FAILURE OF CORPORATE:  I mean, these gorgeous places cost millions to build and it's like they aren't even giving their staff food service training 101, so they have tools to be successful and I get the impression from the wait staff that the kitchen causes a lot of the problem.  TRAIN them, please. Their timing is TERRIBLE.  It took us 10 just to be greeted and put in a drink order.  Whomever actually checks in on social media for CF, I hope to God you're paying attention to the sentiment of your most recent crappy reviews:  there's a reason. OUR ISSUE:  (this time? aside from the poor service) Limp, just past raw potato, fries - a simple ""extra crispy"" request and they weren't even close.  And a veggie burger that was so undercooked, it presented like raw (albeit veggie) hamburger that broke apart and fell from the bun every time I took a bite:  the only reason I ate it (with a FORK!) was because I knew I would be there another hour waiting for someone to come and re-fire it for me ... Aside from that, they forgot the lemons for my daughter's salmon, we had to beg for water and iced tea refills, and it took 20 minutes to get the fries re-fried that I gave up even wanting, because the excitement of excellent fries anticipation was long passed and then I was all agro at what was supposed to be an awesome start of my shopping trip with my 19-year-old. SUMMARY:  Bummed because it really turns me off from CF's in general, thinking that they all might be run like this one, and why bother, when you're busting out $50 for lunch.  Oh yeah, and when I asked for a manager the collective looks from the busser and the hostess up front, chatting, was like ""I have no idea what you're talking about - manager? what's THAT?""  The adult busser looked at the teenage hostess and said, I guess she's IT!""  Ridiculous.  Sad.  Get your sh*# together Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=60

My suggestion to the management would be to a) stagger the start/end times of shifts, b) have a dedicated hh server, c) explain to employees that they can't be so rude.

I got the red velvet cheesecake and if you are a fan of red velvet cake and cheesecake this combo will definitely put you on a cloud a fly you to the moon.

Kassie R.,"Napa, CA",29,14,2,1.0,8/13/2017,"Do you want to experience dining where the wait staff couldn't give a damn that you are there? Well if the answer is yes, then look no further than the Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera.  I have had two very lousy experiences at this location. Let me say that I have been to the Union Square and Walnut Creek locations many times and never had a bad experience ever.  The first bad experience I was with my friend getting dinner. The wait staff barely paid any attention to us. Never bothered to ask how our food was. Never got us drink refills. They gave us the check before we had even finished our dinner. Very rude.  My last terrible experience here was about a month ago. I was passing through the area and decided to stop by for dinner. After waiting for a table for 20 mins (totally understandable) I was seated. I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter ever acknowledged me. Never asked for a drink order. Never said they would be right with me. They managed to service the tables on both sides on mine in this time, but they completely ignored me. After 15 minutes I just left. How hard is it to get service at this location?? I used to love the Cheesecake Factory but honestly after my visits to this location, I'm really starting to think less of the place. I will never EVER return to the Corte Madera location. Worst.

Sylvia L.,"Novato, CA",89,172,66,4.0,4/26/2017,"This is your typical Cheesecake factory. I have only eaten at a couple, but there are many and they all look like this one. It's just pretty average. They were real busy and we had to wait about 20 min. Which is not bad if you're expecting it. There's places to walk around and sit outside, so it's not that bad. They told us it would be about 20 min and it was pretty spot on. It may have been faster, but it definitely wasn't longer. I honestly don't remember what I ordered so it must not have been very memorable. I think it was chicken pot pie. The dessert was the black tie cheesecake, iirc. It had a vanilla mouse and chocolate. Of course, it was bomb as hell. This is not a place I go often, since I do tend to avoid crowds, and try to eat healthy,  but it's fun for a day when you're cheating on your diet and want to have a comforting meal. I have nothing bad to say about it. Then again, my expectations are pretty low when it comes to these types of places.

When they brought it to us they tried to sugar coat it and say the shrimp took a long time...cooking shrimp should take no more than 10 min & that would be over cooked, so I don't buy that. They comped our cheesecake but in my opinion, they should have done more. We were there for almost 2 hours to have a simple lunch. And even with all the waiting they didn't come by our table to make sure we were ok or anything, awful service. Just awful. We saw friends walk into the plaza and they said they were going to boudin next door (mind you we'd already been there 40 min). They went in, order, ate and left and we were just finishing our food when they left. Ridiculous. Save yourself time, money & anger and do NOT go here.

Erin K.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",49,289,190,4.0,4/2/2016,"*VEGAN* & gluten free review: I referenced PETA's guide before coming so that I would have a good idea of what I could/could not eat. According to the guide, the Cheesecake Factory has a lot of items that are vegan-friendly that are not just salads (see list below); however, I decided to just go for a salad anyways and got the ""Super Antioxidant Salad"" with the dressing on the side, which is under the ""Super Food"" page in the menu. It was legit so good. Dressing was on point, almonds, roasted pears, kale, blueberries, etc... so yummy. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed my meal, because chain restaurants don't cater to vegans and special ordering something always turns out way bland. I didn't even have to special order here! I highly recommend this salad for vegans/nonvegans/people who want a salad option.  Here is a copy/paste from PETA's vegan guide of options from Cheesecake Factory. Salads Vegan Cobb Salad Super Antioxidant Salad California Guacamole Salad (Hold the feta cheese, avocado cream drizzle, and try it with any of the vegan dressings listed below instead of the cilantro dressing.)

Carol M.,"Windsor, CA",3,67,,1.0,11/22/2016,"Wow! Been going to this location for years. It represents a bit of a 'ritual' when we are in that area. We always like to go there to be able to bring some amazing Cheesecake home. Went there Sunday night with 3 other people. The wait was relatively short. We asked to be placed in booth as we do grow tired of a table that isn't picked up or cleared during the course of the meal. No booth when there were several unoccupied. But, we have always overlooked this as the Chicken Bellagio is so unique and the Artichoke appetizer is back on the menu. The Food overall is so good! The menu so diverse with so many choices!!!!! We were seated, our wait person introduced himself. We ordered the Calamari and Artichoke as appetizers. Both were delicious. No change in plates, from tiny bread plates with butter wrappers. Are we expected to reach over each other to eat or dip into the sauces? We asked (after I returned a dirty knife) politely, this happens, for other plates. We were asked 'what size'? These were delivered by another waitperson filling in for the first one. The other plates weren't removed. There we go again with a table so crowded, with water, beverages, appetizers, bread plates, silverware that there was no room. We were trying not to get upset by any of this, just ignored it and wanted to focus on enjoying ourselves.  On top of everything else, and it wasn't packed in there, our meals came out and were plopped on the table with this mess by someone else who wouldn't give us time to move the other things. Just set them on the edge of the table and scurried off.  We hadn't had a chance to eat the appetizers. We aren't chronic complainers, don't except a crumbsweeping person. I don't expect a plate of hot food to be handed across my friend's face to reach me. It table was so crowded that we were trying not to knock anything over. I tried 'stacking' a few plates up to make room hoping that someone would notice and didn't until we said something again. By the time we finished the appetizers the food was tepid. We ordered several pieces of that Wonderful Cheesecake to go. We had to plead to get containers for our unfinished dinners. The person brought out small containers which wouldn't have held the food. I asked for larger containers. The waitperson 'smirked' and asked what size do you want? Most waitstaff personnel look at a table and assess these things. We left, still having enjoyed one another, but the experience required much overlooking. For a place so popular, one would have hoped that the 'ratings' would reflect this. After years of overlooking these things, just had to say something!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=120

We walked in and the atmosphere seemed a bit unorganized and should have known our fate when our greeter escorted us to our table-but there was no table. He had to go get a table and set it up while we stood in the isle.  I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich with Swiss cheese and bell peppers. It came 30 minutes later with no cheese and no bell peppers. Waitress-took it back and it was remade again-wrong.  I received my sandwich 25  minutes later with bread so hard-my steak knife could not cut through it. I sent it back asking for fresh bread and it came back 20 minutes later undercooked without cheese or bell peppers --again! How can a cheesesteak sandwich be so difficult? Manager came over and said sorry-but nothing else. Luis-was less than professional.

I get those every single time I go to the Cheesecake Factory. They are AMAZING. -Good drinks. I've liked every drink I've tried there.  -Endive Salad is also delicious.  -Big menu with lots of options.

Somehow seems intimate even though it's crazy busy and packed.  -In a shopping center, so you can always go early and do some shopping :)  -Lots of parking. Cons: -Shopping center closed on 7...on the weekend! So if you're going to dinner, don't expect to be able to browse the shops while waiting. -Like I mentioned before, LONG waits.  -They don't take reservations.

We finish our appetizer and we had to ask for refills and more bread.  Our food arrives, we decide to wait for our bread and drinks. It never arrived. We just decided to eat our meal. Many workers including management walk by multiple times. No one ever bothered to ask if we were okay or if we needed anything.

Our waiter immediately took our drink orders and deliver them promptly. Being on weight watchers we ordered off the skinny licious menu. We ordered a mozzarella flatbread, and then we each ordered a salad: I got the Asian salad and my boyfriend ordered the Mexican tortilla salad. This is where it all started to go bad. Our waiter came back and told us they were completely out of flatbreads. You would think he might've known. However since he didn't, we changed our order to shrimp spring rolls. They were just okay. Not much shrimp and one of the rolls was not put together properly and just fell apart. Next up was our salads and the waiter came over to ask me if I minded if the dressing was on the salad. I told him of course I minded because I needed to have the dressing on the side as I indicated to him when I ordered. We waited an additional 20 minutes while they redid my salad. The salads were good: I can't say they weren't! But again this place is not customer service friendly. They gather a crowd and they know they will so they don't have to put much into it.

Andy C.,"San Quentin, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/14/2016,"Let me preface this review with two things: 1. I am in my 40's and have never had food at a restaurant that was so bad it had to be returned in all the years I've dined out. I'm not a nit picky person. 2. The experience tonight was so bad I opened a Yelp profile  Got seated at 6:30 for a couple burgers and a burrito (table of 3). After placing the order, which included two burgers, medium rare, no ""special"" sauce, we were served at 7:35. Both burgers were served covered in their nasty 1000 island based sauce. My son was starving, so he said he'd eat his. I sent mine back, politely. 25 minutes later, she brings back another burger that was well done, borderline burned. She asked if it was ok and I showed her that it was burnt and that I had asked for medium rare. Her response, "" Thats the kitchens mistake, there's nothing I can do about that"". I asked to speak with the manager after I paid the check and after explaining what happened, got the glazed donut stare from the 22 year old ""manager"". He says, ""well, I didn't charge you for your burger"", and just stares at me. At 8:30, we left with by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  If you ever have the urge to patronize this horrible restaurant, save your time and money and just go to McDonalds or even 7-11. The food will be the same quality but will be much cheaper and you will likely get much better customer service. If it wasn't for their cheesecake, this place would have folded years ago. Despite all the bad reviews, it still stays busy, which is why they don't even respond to all their negative feedback.

You can have a great waiter, or one that could care less.  Unfortunately, tonight we got one that didn't seem to like her job and had no desire to be there.  As for us, we drove 2 hours to get to the restaurant and then waited 40 minutes to get a table.  (We were starving as we hadn't eaten all day.)  However, once we were finally seated, we waited another 20 minutes and never saw a waitress. We had to get up and find a waitress!  When one finally arrived, we asked her to bring lots of bread, water and a passion ice tea.  That could be done in about 5 minutes, right?  No such luck. People who had a different waitress and were seated long after we were, got their drinks and appetizers before our waitress ever came to our table!  I had to get up from the table to go find a waitress, then had to get up again to ask for a manager, when our waitress never showed.   The manager (Julian?) was very apologetic and compt'd us dessert and even delivered a free soup and salad (that we didn't eat), but the service never got any better.  Our waitress had ruined what was supposed to be a special night out.  By the way, our total time from arrival to leaving was over 2 hours to 2 1/2 hours.    I love their avocado egg rolls ($11), chicken madeira ($18), and bang, bang chicken and shrimp ($18).

Daniel W.,"Los Angeles, CA",287,209,50,4.0,11/16/2014,"First, I have to say I resisted this restaurant for a long time.  I went to the original Cheesecake Factory when it was a small place in Beverly Hills, and they always had OK food at inflated prices. The new restaurants, big and a bit gaudy, always had ridiculously long wait times with no reservations and those stupid beeper things that meant you had to stay within 100 feet when they could be using text messaging to let you know when your table is ready. I had some bad experiences here early on, freezing in the back round room while waiters changed and forgot to bring food, etc. All that said--the food is actually quite good, and almost always enough for two meals--so you can take half home. The menu, of course, is so big that everyone can find something that interests them, italian, mexican, american, asian... vegetarian, cheese, meat, fish... I've yet to have a meal that wasn't good here. Not the very best, but always good. The fish 'n chips are standouts. And this is the big thing--there are very, very few late night restaurants in Marin. Most of the county closes down by 9pm at the latest. The earliest this restaurant closes is 10pm on Sunday nights. Monday through Thursday it's open till 11pm, and Friday's it's midnight. That's when the Cheesecake factory is best--late in the evening. You don't have to fight for parking (not enough mall parking in the day). You don't have to wait for an hour or more for a table as you do during more popular hours. ----- IMPORTANT LATE NIGHT TIP: I went there after a premiere of a movie I co-wrote and act in,   and arrived on a Thursday at 10:50pm.  The man at the front desk told me the kitchen was closed. But it doesn't really close till 11, and with a nice, ""pretty please"" from me he let me sit down, and the waitress was fine with it, as was the kitchen.  So if you arrive close to the posted closing time, ask nicely to be seated even if they try to dissuade you (which is kind of odd, but oh, well).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=140

Wasn't ready when I got there and i asked to see the cake before I paid because the workers were literally manhandling them as they were pulling them out of the fridge. I asked why there wasn't any sauce and the employee said I pour it myself so it doesn't get get messy. Because of what she said I asked for 1 more container of raspberry sauce and thought that would be cool. Few things I noticed after I left.. The last sauce I asked for, container was 1/5 full no joke. She swirled it so it looked full when she gave it to me. I know because I looked at the other 2 before paying. I also realized they charged me $10 for ""1 pint"" of sauce. Knowing they don't add sauce to a cake that requires it and then charged you for a punt of it separately, WHERE'S MY EXTRA THAT I NOT ONLY ORDERED BUT PAID FOR?!

To top it all off he gave us two hot towels to clean our hands after the meal and somehow my hands felt softer and cleaner than they have in years (I'm not kidding, I made that exact comment at the table). As usual the food was good and the portions were large. I got the chicken parmesan pizza style which was tasty and the wife got a pear and blue cheese flatbread which she loved.

The fettuccini sauce tasted like it came from a glass jar. Something tasted store made to me, not freshly prepared. The noodles were OK, like I said earlier nothing to write home about.

The over-the-top theme park level decor and ambiance make it seem like a concession at Disney World, and the crowds are mostly just as I described; large parties that are visiting families. The long waits at busy times and big plastic buzzers contribute to that effect. The food is competent, standard anywhere-in-America fare, but very caloric, huge portions, with large doses of butter and sugar to appeal to the mainstream. Still, it will appeal to older relatives and kids, visitors who are averse to culture shock, since this is not unlike any other in the chain, and they seem to be geared towards seating large parties.

I find it odd that the one dish on the menu that doesn't come in ginormous size is the cheesecake. I don't know if they still do it as I didn't experience it last time but it seems like they used to schedule their employees to never make it though a customers meal.  That is prior to the last time I went I don't recall making it through a meal with a single server. I always had two.  This of course causes service problems and while good for the chain (short term) is bad for the server and customer (immediately).  Long term, their scheduling system is part of what keeps me out of here.

Since having a little one, my wife and I have had to figure out more kid friendly dining options and this has become a go to as a result. The undeniable benefit here is that there is literally something for everyone in the menu and all the specialties I have had so far are very good. The Hibachi Steak is by far my favorite but I have yet to not enjoy my eating experience here. The service is hit or miss as with most chains and depends largely on which server you get.

Michelle H.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,51,2,2.0,7/27/2016,"Sooooo, I'm a Cheesecake Factory enthusiast!  CF is the perfect place to go when no one wants to make a decision on a particular type of food.  CF has a little of everything, and it's always very delicious.  For this visit, my family and I had just gotten into town, and this was our first meal commencing a week-long family adventure.  We hadn't taken a trip like this since we were kids.  It was something special, and we knew CF would send us off correctly.  Oh man, were we sorely mistaken.  Luckily this was the only mistake we made that week.  Ok back to the review.  Our server was Bryan, and at first he was very attentive.  He made contact with our table quickly, got our drink orders promptly (along with their famous bread), and took our order in a timely manner.  Then it all went to hell.  Our food came and tasted fine, but for NO JOKE 20 minutes, he went by our table without checking on us.  No ""two minute, two bite"" check back to see if everything came out okay.  No refills.  Not even a glance our way.  My Dad went without a drink his entire meal!  And you might ask, why didn't you raise a hand or call for him?  WE DID.  But he had a needy 5-top in the booth next to us that was taking him all over the restaurant with their requests....  I get it, I served for 8 years at a similar corporate restaurant, and it's hard to break away from a table like that, but you HAVE to BALANCE your SERVICE.  MULTITASKING is a MUST.  There is no room for going back and forth for ONE table.  Full hands in, full hands out.  That's the job.  Finally my sister got out of the booth and had to stand in front of him to stop him from walking by.  She asked for the check and boxes.  He knew he was in trouble.  He took the plates that needed to be boxed, then we got the check.  BUT HE ADDED ANOTHER TABLE'S BILL ONTO OUR CHECK.  Bryan, always glance at your check before printing.  There were no drinks on it, so the sequence of service was off.  Or perhaps you hadn't closed a previous check, which prompted the lack of drinks when you began our check.  Whatever it is, it's a messy way to work.  So we got the manager over and my sister explained what happened and he had that look.  It's the look of slight defensiveness, he's heard complaints one too many times at his restaurant.  He said he'd take 25% off and fix the ticket.  Cool, great, we just want to leave.  The manager brings back the ticket, AND IT'S FOR THE WRONG HALF OF THE BILL!  It's for a 2-top and there were four of us!  How did he not catch this?!  So then my sister hunts down the manager again.  And he doesn't say a word, just gets us the right half without eye contact and no one comes back pick up our check.  So we leave cash and were on our way.  For CF standards, I'd petition to shut this location down, you don't need this kind of negativity on your good name.  The only reason it's still open is because happy hour options (or options as a whole) are limited in Corte Madera.  Your location works in your favor.  Just...if you're reading this as a nice family going on an awesome vacation and want a place you're familiar with so you think Let's Go To CF!  Don't.  Try their local restaurants.  OH!  Or Super Duper Burgers in Mill Valley!  That place was AMAZING!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=200

The reason to come here, though, is to get dessert.  Even if you are too stuffed from the rest of your meal, you need to get a slice of cheesecake, at least to go.  We ordered 5 different slices and shared them, and they were all excellent.

I'm IN!!   We sat at the tables by the bar.  It didn't take long for our server to acknowledge us (I can't remember his name though).  My mom ordered a cranberry juice & club soda, I ordered a mojito.  The server brought out  the wrong drink for my mom (2 separate glasses of soda & juice lol) but was very quick to correct it.  After that we ordered our food and our server brought out the bread and we asked for olive oil (we don't use butter).  Our server disappeared after that.  I don't know if he was scared of us or if he was just busy.  We had to ask another server for water.  We were never checked on but it was ok but still a quick "" how's it going"" is nice.   I'm a server at a busy restaurant where at certain points especially during a shift change I can have up to 7 tables or more and still give good service.  The restaurant wasn't very busy at the time so I'm not sure if this guy was having a bad day or if his tables were just being needy.  The Cheesecake Factory in Honolulu (where I live) is the busiest one in the chain and their servers always manage to make it back for a check up.   We left a decent tip because the server was at least nice and polite.  He would have gotten a better one if he didn't disappear.   Three stars for the good food....but work on your service Cheesecake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=260

I didn't mind it at all because it was just one. I only took a couple bites and saved it for home.  When I got home I got hungry again after work so I warmed my food up and found another piece of hair and it was in my mouth. I didn't mind it again even tho my hair isn't short and black. I put my food to the side and saved it for later. I got hungry again and I finally went in to finish the rest of my lunch size miso salmon only to find another piece of short black hair in my mouth.... UGGHHHH!!! Now I'm really dissatisfied. Do they not wear hear nets? Ridiculous...  The hair was found in my brown rice. I just called them to make a complaint. Not looking for any reimbursement or anything because I didn't pay for lunch. It was a pharma Rep lunch. I told Jessica one of the managers about this incident and she was super kind and helpful. All I wanted to know after finding the 3rd piece of short black hair maybe 4 inches long... If their staff wore hair nets. She said they do so I don't know how that happened.

It's not our first times here, but definitely our first time for lunch/happy hour.  We arrived around 3ish and found out that happy hour didn't start until 4pm, so we ordered our lunch plates first (good until 5pm).   First thing I love about this place is that they give you a basket of free bread. Since we both liked the brown oat bread, the server gave us just only that. I ordered a half sandwich/soup/salad combo, and I had expected a small plate, but what was supposed to be ""half"" of a chicken salad sandwich, it was big enough to be a whole sandwich! I also paired it with a spicy chicken tortilla soup and a huge portion of their infamous ceasar salad...ALL for under $10! So we were sooo stuffed from our overly portioned lunch plates that we forgot all about ordering drinks for happy hour! The service was an added bonus to our meal as well. Don't be surprised if I'm a regular at this location and the San Francisco Macy's location (I just hate the long wait for that one).  And what was our original purpose for vising this place? Oh yes, the cheesecake. We never ever have space in our tummy for cheesecake, but I promise, promise to make time for you, my white chocolate raspberry truffle.

We were given a defective pager, and ended up having to wait an extra twenty minutes. Then, the waitress didn't realize we were a party of six until she brought us all out to the patio. We had to go back to the front of the restaurant to wait for just two tables to be pushed together. In the process, our waitress hurt herself (how or to what extent, I do not know) and didn't let anyone know that we were waiting. My boyfriend repeatedly had to ask for the hosts to check on our situation. We got the impression that they totally didn't care for our service since they were completely packed.

Unfortunately for the last 3 months or so we've found it nearly impossible to place our order.  I start trying to place the order once we exit the Waldo tunnel and I am ALWAYS put on hold.  I've tried holding until we get to CF.  I've tried hanging up, redialing, and complaining to the receptionist who answers that NO, I do not want to be put on hold.  Finally, last Tuesday (8-21-12), I walked into CF still on hold and asked for ""the manager""  A young lady who said she was ""the manager"" apologized profusely and said they'd been really busy...yet there was only one order sitting there and no other cars outside in the pick-up area. She explained that it's just her (running between the kitchen and the counter/car) and the server behind the counter.  Only they (or her?) can take the orders because there are more than 200 items and the receptionist's aren't capable of asking the right questions.  Since the restaurant wasn't busy I asked why the servers couldn't help out when they were busy and that they shouldn't leave customers on hold for so long.   Prior to 2-3 months ago we were only rarely put on hold and only for a minute or two.  I haven't been able to successfully place an order by phone since then. Since it only takes 15 minutes or so to prepare the order (yeah!!) placing the order earlier doesn't work.  IF I have to walk inside to order...what is the purpose of your pick-up area?  Why is the receptionist answering the phone for Take-out if all she is going to do is put me on hold?  What process ensures that somebody eventually takes the held calls?  The few times I've managed to place the order before arriving was when I hung up and dialed until the person answering was different and took the order directly.  I've also sat on hold for 15 minutes only to have my calls dropped.  I want Take-Out fixed!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=320

Our bread came awhile later, isn't that the first thing to hit the table even before the drinks come? The food was as expected, good! Our server was NOT on top of filling drinks either. The mister's soda was finished for quite a bit and the server was no where to be seen or found. We had to put the cup on the edge of the table for someone to notice and when he finally came out he took the cup, but never returned the refill so we had to ask him for that.

Amber C.,"Burlingame, CA",94,23,,2.0,4/14/2014,"This is the first (and possibly last) time I have visited this Cheesecake Factory. I'm more familiar with the SF location, and have always had a great experience there. Our names were taken, and after a short wait my friend and I were seated. Our waitress was friendly, and checked in with us (we took a bit of time to get settled and figure out what we want).  When the waitress returned, my friend ordered the Asian Pear Martini, and I a glass of white wine. I ordered the entree Pear and Endive salad, while my friend said she'd like to start with an appetizer salad. Imagine my surprise when my ""entree salad"" came back on a tiny plate. After poking around a bit at my salad, I didn't find any fo the grilled chicken, pear or blue cheese I had expected. My friend discovered there is also an ""Endive Salad"" on the appetizer menu, and, after conferring with the waitress, we discovered there had been a slight mixup. She had thought I wanted the appetizer Endive, not the entree Pear and Endive. An honest mistake, which she readily fixed. The Endive salad was whisked away, and after a bit my Pear and Endive salad was brought out. Here was why I gave this location two stars. The salad was extremely disappointing!!! Let me explain. I'm not a super picky food eater. Something has to be extremely awful or bland for me to dislike it. In general, I love food. But this salad was terribly bland. I could have made a better version at home for half the price. My friend and I soon discovered that the ratios of the meal were completely off. I basically received a bowl of greens with grilled chicken. The salad has almost no dressing on it. I discovered three (three!) TINY hunks of blue cheese at the bottom of my dish, and almost no walnuts. There was also almost no pear. Essentially, I ate through the slightly dry greens, and ended up enjoying about 3 bites worth of properly proportioned greens-extras mix at the bottom of my dish.  This was a huge disappointment. We all go out for dinner expecting a treat, but I ended up enjoying the complimentary bread more than the salad I ordered. I think with the proper mix of ingredients, the taste would be a hit. But this salad was an absolute no go. My friend enjoyed her appetizer salad and salmon though, so I am thrilled she picked something that was done right. She did not like her martini though, because it was very sweet, almost like syrup. The bottom of the martini had a gritty texture from the pear puree. The two stars I give: one for the waitress who was friendly and very attentive. The second: the cheesecake.  The saving grace of this meal was the cheesecake. Our waitress recommended the smores cheesecake, and my friend and I split it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Holy moly. They even top it with their house-made marshmallow fluff. It truly saved the day. I am still very much on the fence about whether to return to the Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera again.

Christian H.,"San Rafael, CA",145,233,408,2.0,3/22/2009,"Let's take a moment to discuss the topic of Ketchup Cleanliness.   Corporate restaurants like this Cheesecake Factory have a condiment policy that items like ketchup always come to the table with a full bottle.  How would they do that without bringing each and every table a brand new bottle?  They DON'T.  What they do instead is have their servers marry the glass ketchup bottles so that they are ""presented full"" to each table they go to.   What's wrong with that, you ask?  First, you will notice that Heinz Ketchup  clearly tells you not to do that on the labels of their bottles.  Second, the color of the ketchup will change over time, turning more of a dark brown color.  Third, think about all the possible bacterial transfers that could happen by recycling the ketchup from table to table.  Fourth, over time...old ketchup will begin a gassy fermentation which can be noticed if you look closely and see bubbles forming in it. What happens with all that gassy fermentation, you ask?  If you were sitting at the bar last Thursday for lunch, you got the answer RIGHT IN YOUR FACE while you had lunch!  One guy opened a gassy, bacteria-infested ketchup bottle to use for his burger and the entire contents VOLCANOED out of the bottle onto everyone in a ten foot radius! Come on, Cheesecake Factory.  This problem was so five-years ago in the restaurant industry.  Order the smaller, squeezable ketchup bottles that you can't take the cap off of to marry, transfer bacteria or shower all of your customers with while they are just trying to enjoy lunch!

Being from California, this was just frightening and I would stay away as much as I could (their addicting brown sugar and French rolls don't help at all, nor do their slushy like drinks)...  And then one day I went with my girlfriend and I saw their ""reduced calorie"" menu--drinks and food both. 100 calorie Mojitos? I got two! Flavorful and refreshing! We split the Asian Chicken Salad (under 400 calories) along with the Miso Salmon with extra sauce (how wrong can you go with fish if you stay away from the white rice, right?!). But since we were already there and saving ourselves just thousands of calories already, we just had to order the (fried) Avocado egg rolls!  The salad was delicious and refreshing--I think it is their dressing that does the trick. The Miso Salmon with extra brown sauce was perfectly glazed and cooked just right - not over done, and not squishy. I also really enjoyed dipping the salmon in the white sauce that the rice sat on. And the avocado egg rolls--- you just can' go wrong with the word ""Avocado"" and the implication of something ""fried"" in the same phrase.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=280

I don't usually review let alone go to chain restaurants but hunger hit when the sun went down and we had to eat fast.  We had extremely attentive service, food came within 15 minutes of ordering. The menu is pretty vast.  My pasta with roast veggies was tasty all things considered. I assume when I go to places like that that my food at the best of times will be a little salty and will lack complexity and may contain a lot of corn starch.  With my large pasta dish (enough for two meals for me), a pellegrino and coffee I paid about $20.00.

The menu is exactly the same as any other Cheesecake Factory.  If you haven't been to one yet, be prepared for menu overload and understand that portions are all huge.  This was our first time both ordering from the Skinnylicious menu.  Ignoring the silly name, this menu actually solves a big problem I have with Cheesecake Factory.  Usually the meals are way too big and I feel overfull even after just eating a portion of the meal, but this new menu does a good job of providing more balanced meal.

I had to get up and find my daughter a booster seat because no one offered and no one came by that we could ask for help from. No apology for the wait. The waitress was super rushed to take our order - basically told us to order our apps + meals at one time (and as I could've guessed they ALL came out at once). No room on the table. She dropped forks on the floor, didn't offer to replace them. She was ""new"" and complaining about how busy they were and venting about the job?! We wanted the artichoke appetizer. they were out. The gentlemen next to us ordered Thai lettuce wraps, they were out. And the men on the other side of us ordered the lemon herb chicken, and they were out of that too! We ended up having to take more than 1/2 our food home because of the ill timing of the poor service.

We waited again but nothing happened. We saw several tables that were empty but needed to be cleaned.  Eventually we just went and cleaned off the table ourselves and sat down. Within seconds the host ran outside and asked us if we were sat down by someone? We said no but we were tired of waiting.  She left us there and said she will get us some menus. After another 10 minutes of waiting we got menus and some evil looks from the waitress. Then after ordering the waitress forgot our order and apologizes several times blaming the computer for it.  After about 1.5 hours of wait we got our food that wasn't even that hot anymore.  After complaining the manager offered us free cheesecake. We paid our bill and waited for the free cake that never came. We eventually left and as we passed the cheesecake station  the manager saw us and ran over to the cheesecake station to ask for our cheesecake.  She then rushed over to us to say it's being prepared.

Other restaurants in this chain are superior to this one. Additionally, they were out of soup, out of pumpkin cheesecake and this was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Server didn't recommend alternatives, just said without apology, we are ""out."" The vegeburger ordered by two at the table was literally so sloppy it would require a spoon.

The food was cooked okay, I felt as if my dish was a tad bit over cooked, but manageable as the bold flavors was there, but there was a missing element in the other dish as it lacked saltiness. I am assuming it was missing the pancetta. On to the service, Our server Michelle, was very kind and welcoming, however she lacked on checking up on our table as for her other tables. I only had one cup of water, wanted more bread, and I'm assuming her manager or someone had to pull her out of a conversation she was having with a customer at the bar for I'd say 20 mins. When we asked for to-go boxes, I surprised that this cheesecake factory had their customers box their own food. Our server Michelle was generous enough to give us two separate bags for our boxes, BUT she placed the bags directly on top of my dish.

We arrived shortly after 7 pm and were immediately seated in a cozy, private booth by our vivacious and bubbly hostess.  Soon afterwards, we were greeted by Kate, our server, who never lapsed or missed a beat during our meal. The Chicken Madeira (Kate's recommendation) was INCREDIBLE and exceeded the exhuberant description provided by Kate.  The Salmon Scampi Combo was declicous mouth-watering beyond belief.  The Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp would make the King of Siam green with envy.   The Jambalaya Pasta which I ordered, because it was the entree most closely akin to Weight Watcher standards, didn't pass muster.  The chicken was succulent, but the shrimp and sausage were dry and over-cooked.  The pasta was a dente as it should have been, but someone in the kitchen got carried away with powdering the entire dish with chili powder.   Argh!   Sometimes I HATE weight watchers!

This last time we went, we were a group of 5 people and all shared a artichoke and spinach dip, while having individual entrees for dinner. We all fealt really bad the next day, two of us actually had to go to the e.r for food poisoning ( fortunately) I wasn't one of them.  I called them up and told them about the situation, and informed them there was no doubt in my mind that the dip made us all sick. I asked her if she had any other reports of people feeling the same last night and she told me no. Funny enough, I called my friend to see how he was doing and he told me he had gotten off phone with the manager 20 minutes before I called reporting that the artichoke dip made him sick. Hmmm, not cool management. As bad as it may seem to admit your food made us sick, you should have the morality of advising us that others reported food poisoning, and that medical attention was needed in the other incidents ( my buddies fiancé was one of the 2 people in the e.r), he made sure the management was aware.  They did ask me for my address to send a gift certificate; at least they were apologetic; however I did not give it to them and have no intentions of ever risking feeling that way at a Cheesecake Factory ever again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=360
Carrie S.,"San Francisco, CA",21,128,20,4.0,2/24/2010,"Just had dinner at The Cheesecake Factory last night. I really enjoyed myself. I started at the bar with a GG martini, dry and up with olives and it was made perfectly and served in a nice frozen glass. The bartender was friendly and fast! I was meeting girlfriends that evening and we had a booth in the back. Our food server (Mathew) was very friendly and made sure to introduce himself to us (twice even when someone arrived late!). He rattled off the specials of the day with ease and aplomb and made them sound so delish we ordered one! The crab artichoke dip was yummy and started the meal off with a bang. We all tend to order the same things every time we go to TCF but the food is always consistent and fresh. Half the table ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad (yum), someone ordered the fresh spring rolls as an entree which worked out well, another ordered the fish tacos which are always a standout.  We skipped dessert but took several slices of cheesecake to go. Our waiter even brought our girlfriend (who announced she's expecting again) an ice cream sundae on the house! TCF is a great place to go with a group, kids, or even a date. It's fun, there are TONS of food options and the service is reliably good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=360

The service was just OK; it could have been much better. The weird thing was watching a couple bring their dog, obviously not a service dog, into the restaurant. If they were seated outside, I'd understand. The management was well aware and just allowed them to exist. Maybe those people were wealthy and the employees were afraid of offending them. Whatever.

For some reason I always seem to think that the service ""isn't that bad"" and today, again, I was reminded of just how wrong I can be.  NOTE:: The food is great, this review has nothing to do with the food, which is probably why I keep suffering through a meal here, because I so enjoy the vast menu of yumminess.  Don't tell anyone but I'm pretty sure our server was an auto-bot of some sort because his voice never changed tone and I'm pretty sure I didn't see any facial expressions. And someone forgot to program the ""check on your tables after they get their food"" setting because after we got our food he didn't come check on us until we were actually done eating.  In our desperate attempt to quench our thirst we had to ask a food runner for a refill but he said ""your server (aka auto-bot) will help you,"" in the end, another lovely server who obviously knows what she was doing (wish she had been MY server) got our refills.  In addition we were sat without the following: silverware, salt, pepper, condiments and bread, although I realize the bread comes after the fact.  Again, food good, service, really, really poor. I would recommend eating at the bar where the bartenders have no way of getting away from you.

Kid friendly?  Eh- debatable.  They have a kids menu, ok.  But restaurants that classify themselves as ""Kid Friendly"" should at least offer some crayons and something to doodle on.  The best kid friendly restaurants all do!  I know, all my friends without kids give me the ""You should come prepared and bring that stuff with you"".  Well, maybe- but once you have kids you truly appreciate the places that try to make taking your kids out just a little easier- and those places get more of my $$$, for sure.   All in all, good place for lunch or dinner with older kids and adults- but if you're looking for a familiy night out with young kids-- go over to Max's across the freeway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=360

Normally I would avoid the Cheesecake Factory like the plague - but I took my chances and hope that we didn't have to wait 2 hrs for a table. We got there at 9pm - rather late for dinner and we only had to wait 5-10 mins max. Perfect! We were seated quickly and the waiter took our order. I like how they they give you fresh rye and sourdough bread with butter to munch on while you wait for your food.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls - one of my favorite appetizers here. It was really delicious but the dipping sauce was a little sweet. We also ordered the Cuban sandwich and substituted the fries for a side of mac and cheese. The sandwich was actually really good - not oily and with a unique taste. The mac and cheese was delicious - made with white cheddar and was creamy and not too cheesy. I could have just had a side of that for dinner. The strawberry lemonade was good - but way too sweet.  Overall our experience here was good. We didn't have to wait the normal 1-2 hrs for a seat, and the service here was actually very attentive. Portions here are huge so I suggest sharing if you can. We didn't even order a lot, and we took half a sandwich home. The cheesecake looked really good and there was a great selection but we were really full.

Justin L.,"Stanford, CA",1239,545,232,3.0,6/20/2007,"My Rating:  3.5 STARS Okay, hate to admit it...but every so often I get the urge to hit up Cheesecake.  Yeah, yeah...I know it's a tourist trap...and I know it's not exactly ""fine"" dining...but hey, I really dig the appetizers. The thing I however hate most about Cheesecake is the ridiculously long wait to get seated.  If you're already hungry and you try to go to the Union Square, Palo Alto or Valley Fair locations, forget about being seated before you pass out from hypoglycemia. Because of the typically insane waitlist on any given night, I have avoided Cheesecake altogether for quite some time.  My explorations of the Bay recently led me to The Village at Corte Madera (sounds like some sequel from M. Night Shyamalan).  Situated right next to Nordstrom sits a Cheesecake Factory that I had no idea existed.  Feeling famished from a long day, we stopped by.  While we were already prepared to be turned away by the host telling us that there was an hour+ wait...we were actually shocked when he said we would be seated in 10-15 min.  And as promised, our little restaurant pager lit up within 15 min.  We were set up with a nice table out on the patio right under a heat lamp.  Waitress was very pleasant and provided us with really good service.  We ordered the appetizer sampler of course...avocado eggrolls were so excellente after working up an appetite from explorin' the Marin Headlands.  For dessert, I have never really enjoyed any of their actual cheesecakes...so this time I sampled the Chocolate Truffle Cake.  If you like chocolate...get this cake...period. So if you're ever tired of fighting to hit all the foodie hotspots and you simply want some huge portions of fatty American food...this Cheesecake location will hit the spot...without the wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=360
Sami R.,"San Francisco, CA",8,170,,3.0,7/5/2010,"Chain restaurants tend to have it tough when it comes to Yelp reviews, as the bar seems to be set at a higher mark for them simply because of that. We have been to plenty of four star Yelp rated restaurants, which ended up being lackluster, while we have been to several chain restaurants with low ratings that ended up being fairly good. Chevy's is one, Cheesecake Factory is another. This place isn't fantastic, but our experience here was overall good. We ordered the Caesar Salad and the Basil Chicken pasta. The portions here are huge, with both being more than enough to keep us full with enough left overs for an entire second meal at a later occasion as well. The service was also more or less good, as the waitress kept our bread full before the food arrived. However, there was a huge delay in terms of the process of getting our check.  Pasta was good though, salad was good. Neither was top of the line, and we have had better elsewhere, but each was still tasty in its own right and something we were glad we ordered in the end. We did end up asking for some extra Caesar dressing, though, as it was lacking a little in that department, and the waitress was happy to bring us another container. Overall, this place was good. We are kind of conflicted between 3 and 4 stars. There are aspects of it that seem to apply to both just being ""okay"" and being ""very good"". Suffice to say, though, that we will be going back to a Cheesecake Factory in the future, this location or another, when we feel like pigging out on some huge portions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=360

I dont get what the big deal is about this place.  First off its always so crowded and the inside is dark and tacky.  Second, the food is not good.  I know alot of people that go here cause you get large portions and heaping salads, but most often that just means I have to eat alot of crappy stuff because I dont want to waste food (and I try to never send food back).   I had a chinese chicken salad and serious it tasted like window cleaner.  I told the waiter as we were leaving and he got all defensive (since I dared insult the cheesecake factory) saying he had it for lunch and it was fine.  Lastly, the place is really overpriced.  Just cause you add some toasted pine nuts and cilantro to a dish does not justify making it 19.50 rather than 7.50.  For what you pay, there are really a number of other significantly better resturaunts in marin.   Oh and the weight management menu.  What a crock of shit!  I love it when restaurants do this.  Take a jog or walk if you want to lose weight, because food from cheesecake factory is not going to make you a size five dear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=400

I appreciate their smiling staff. Their food took a bit of a dip in cooking technique in 2008, but they seem to have bounced back since then.  I appreciate their decor and ambiance. It reminds me of the old HUGE movie palaces back East where they have Egyptian styled lobbies. Chandeliers, pillars, mirrors, etc. these old movie houses have been turned into restaurants back home on the East coast, so I understand the decor that Cheesecake is going for. The decor is over the top and that suits us just fine. The whole vibe goes along with the Village Mall experience of shopping energy and big multiple visuals.  Love the smiley guy host at the front door with the long blonde hair. When he's not there, our dining experience is not complete. Love the Ahi Carpaccio, Roasted Lemon Chicken, Meatloaf, Pork Chops, with Mashed Potatoes, Carrots, Pecan Crusted Catfish, Tiramisu and Lemoncello Cake.

It's not the type of place that I would wait to be seated at. If I'm going to wait, I'm going to seek out the best of the best, but I look forward to going here once every few months for the atmosphere, good service, and yummy cocktails,. I went with my bf yesterday before the Giants game and sat in the self-seating cocktail area at one of the hightops. Service was really friendly, charming and funny. I ordered the Blueberry Mojito which was delicious, although I'd order it with an added shot next time. Next I tried the Asian Pear Martini! This was a stronger drink, but had a somewhat syrupy texture I didn't love. It was also quite sweet. My bf had a spiked banana milkshake, yum! Because I like drinking there and I already know that the drinks have half a day's worth calories in them, I usually order off the skinnylicious (stupid name!) menu, and so far there's nothing on it that I wouldn't recommend. The bleu cheese and pear flatbread was chewy and flavorful, but I recommend eating it while it's hot! It was super soggy for breakfast this morning. I also tried the fried mac and cheese balls (no, not on the skinnylicious menu)! Omg, I could barely finish one. Sooo rich, but very yummy! The beet salad was very good too.

Any vinegar. I just tasted freshly washed salad mix. Hmmm...  For the main entree, I went for the LUNCH PORTION romano chicken. I emphasize LUNCH PORTION because when a menu says ""lunch portion"" you would think it would be a small portion right? Well, I sure think that way. So it comes out and it's HUGE. 1 very large flattened chicken breast and what looked to be almost an entire box of spaghetti with sauce. Come on people!! You don't need THAT MUCH FOOD for lunch!!!!  I don't like to complain, but hear me out for a second. I don't know where the portions got so out of hand. Americans want more and more and bigger and bigger.

Two generous pieces of boneless chicken, lightly breaded and sauteed with a cream sauce. It came with about a pound of mashed potatoes, no joke, and 2 cups of steamed broccoli. Enough for two normal adults even without an appetizer. I had a glass of Mark West Pinot. My son had a chicken quesadilla (he ate half) and my daughter had the child's corn dogs.

Matt R.,"San Rafael, CA",3,172,,2.0,11/7/2011,"We ate here mid-shift on Sunday afternoon October 30. I mention mid-shift because it appeared the kitchen was indifferent and did not care if the items cooked matched what had been ordered. The combination cream of chicken artichoke soup was excellent. I had bits of bell peppers, corn, and mushrooms  (it took a very long time to get to the table and we looked out and saw people outside who had arrived after us served before us). We ordered a grilled artichoke, which came out boiled, not grilled, and with a very bland sauce. We asked the manager (see below) when she asked about the hamburger, how the artichoke was supposed to be cooked, and she answered grilled meant it had grill marks. This artichoke had none. The manager said it was not cooked the way it was supposed to be. A Kobe (American) hamburger ordered medium rare came out burned well, and had to be sent back. Once it returned (now more rare than medium rare) it was very good. The chicken salad sandwich appeared to be how bland can you go? The sandwich, which claims to be on brioche toast, came out with toasted white bread . The chicken salad, stated to have almonds, did have some almonds -- about two slivers (sprinkled on by the chef before serving?  Tranced out?), and had no seasoning. I didn't think mayonnaise was a seasoning, but perhaps I am wrong. The chicken tasted as though it was not fresh. Service (referring to the servers not the kitchen staff) was excellent. The manager, when she heard the hamburger had to be sent back, apologized and comped the hamburger and the artichoke. Others have noted that the service persons do not always match who takes your order. Our experience was not different, but I think the servers  tried hard.  The food here, as others have noted, can vary.

My last visit was awesome, starting with an exceptional service provided by a Ukrainian waitress, I can't remember her name but she was ridiculously adorable and her accent even sweeter than the cheesecake I had for dessert.  My dinner consisted of a small cup of clam chowder and the Bang-Bang chicken and shrimp. I did not like the soup much because it was too heavy but the main course was excellent. I loved the coconut sprinkles with the curry sauce the chicken and shrimp are mixed with. For dessert I enjoyed the White Chocolate Raspberry Cream cheesecake, the waitress said it was the main seller and I decided to try it.

A few other downsides are the inconsistent service as well as the premium prices for mediocre drinks. On our last visit there was no bread or water, and we had to ask for utensils including a serving spoon to share the main course. Mixed drinks over $14?

Nobody liked their food, I could tell by the almost entirely full plates.  The waiters were kind and refilled our drinks often, but the food was horrendous.  I ordered the fish and chips (tempura batter fried,) with some fries, but for $14 I could have gone to the wharf and spent less for the same thing. It turned out to be the best out of all of the other five dishes we ordered.  The chicken piccata can be described as a mass of cold, old, and dried out spaghetti with a nonexistent amount of sauce. The chicken was similar to a frozen dinner entree. The fish cost $16. The meatloaf consisted entirely of bread, and the Shepherd's pie was chunks of ground beef in sauce, with mashed potatoes on top--where did the pie part go?  The food was way too overpriced and generally nasty. The bread was not good either.  Our booth was filthy, laden with old food, with a greasy table to add to the unclean sitting area.

So I don't know what happened tonight, but dinner service completely fell apart. Our table and every other table nearby was having a horrible experience. Slow meal service, missing waiters, orders coming out at inappropriate times.Our table-neighbor got her cheesecake before the main dish ever arrived.  Cheesecake Factory tries to push out kid dishes earlier, which is nice, however our other neighbors did not get the adult dishes for 20 minutes after their kid was finished eating and we got all of ours. Even getting a cup of lemonade for my son took 15 minutes and was delivered by a random person separate from our other drinks. I was going to write this all off to the kitchen or management but our waiter walked around with our check after running my credit card for at least 15 minutes. He was apologetic but it was just another thing that made dinner service Kitchen-Nightmares-worthy on this particular night. The stars it gets are because the food was pretty OK. I had the Romano Crusted Chicken and it was good (the chicken was good, but the pasta and sauce were bland). My wife's chicken pasta was pretty good as well. And I've generally heard good things about Cheesecake Factory but after spending 1h45m for a simple one-course meal, I just can't give them a favorable review this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=220

The bf and I had to come back to the Village at Corte Madera (an outdoor  shopping mall) because for once, he needed to purchase stuff and I'm returning goods. That almost NEVER happens. If you don't want to leave the immediate mall area, there are 3 choices for food: CF, Boudin SF and the lil cafe by Nordies. CF won. The host was suspiciously cheery for a rainy day, but I appreciated his perkiness. There was no wait which was a plus, since we were hungry. We ordered a Mojito (too sweet for our taste) to sip on while waiting for our food to come.  Normally, I gorge on the bread basket at CF, since their dark oat bread is good, but this time it was just okay and the french bread was hard. I think I cut the upper roof of my mouth from chewing on the hard edges. I ordered from the small bites menu since I wanted to try a salad and a pizza without lugging leftovers around while at the mall and the portions were just right for me.  I loved the sweet beets in my salad with goat cheese, peppery arugula and candied walnuts.  A little heavy on the dressing though. The Wild Mushroom pizzette looks like a elongated flatbread. It had plenty of cheese and the mushrooms were cooked just right.  Bf liked his Classic burger which was served with bleu cheese sauce on the side.   Our server Dominic had a cute smile and easy demeanor, but wish he was more doting on his service.

Even if the columns, cornices, and stained glass light fixtures aren't real, they give the Cheesecake factory a palatial feel. You are greeted by someone with a permanent smile who also says goodbye to you when you leave. I think our greeter was one of the kids from Hanson. You know, Mmm Bop. But the menu. Come on. It's spiral bound with about forty-twelve pages of food, pictures, and advertisements. Advertisements? Do I really need to be thinking about a diamond necklace while I eat? There were just too many choices. It took fifteen minutes just to look through the whole thing. The food wasn't bad but it all seemed so over-the-top, rich, and large.

Mrs F.,"San Francisco, CA",13,323,,4.0,7/6/2009,"It's around a 3.5 star place, but with the location (we like most of the small towns north of the GG Bridge) and service, we can round up. The food was nice (and the portions huge - not our portions, but all the burger and fries and meal-sized salads we saw around us).   I've only been to Cheesecake Factory once in my life before this, and that was in Seattle many moons ago.  I remember the pasta was cheesy and the cheesecake addicting.  So when my husband and I were here over the weekend shopping, instead of buying a sandwich at Boudin SF, I said let's try Cheesecake Factory, since he had only been to CF once his life also. I wanted pasta and dessert.  He wanted the Cubano sandwich.  We also got a menu listing all the calories of every dish they served.  It had everything on it, every appy, every lunch special, every drink.  We were in shock.  My husband was in so much shock I had to tell him to keep his voice down.  Even with his running and weight conditioning everyday, he could not justify the roughly 1600 calories (give or take a couple hundred cals) on one Cubano sandwich.  The pasta dishes I wanted were creamy sauces.  Even at the smaller lunch portion, they were around 1200 calories.  The tomato-based sauces were 1000 calories.   So what did we get?  He had an egg-white omelette, I had the simply grilled salmon with vegies.  Each was 900 cals or under.  It was just a piece of salmon, no sauce.  But it was a good size, and pretty flavorful even without any sauces.  It came with a nice side salad with vinaigrette dressing.   To start off they served really gooood bread!  I ate maybe 600 cals worth of bread just there alone. This was our first time dining out and were able to look at the calories of our meals.  I don't know if I like it or not!  It didn't make for an enjoyable lunch.  I guess after time, we will get used to it and learn to look past the calories.  If you substitute for lighter sides, the numbers go down.   I'm going to give a shout out to our server, Ashleigh.  She was fantastic.  She spoke so clearly, slowly, and gently.  She was so professional, too.  I think she was 21 or so, but her attitude was so mature and just - nice!  I really enjoyed hearing her speak.

Rebecca J.,"Mill Valley, CA",48,22,,1.0,8/17/2012,"In this day & age when almost every restaurant you visit, no matter how small, is gluten-sensitive (even pizza places!), I was extremely disappointed by my recent experience at The Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera.  Although the menu is ENORMOUS, there was no gluten free section and everything I asked the server about had some form of gluten--including things where there shouldn't even be any wheat at all!  Normally at the very least salads are a safe bet, but I was informed that ALL of Cheesecake Factory's salad dressings contain gluten.  As do the soups.  The server had no suggestions for me so I then asked about the nachos, but was informed that even the sour cream contains gluten!  What?  Gluten in sour cream?  It is certainly not in the sour cream that I buy at the grocery store...  At that point I lost my appetite altogether as I realized just how unhealthy the food there is in general.   Couldn't the Cheesecake Factory perhaps dedicate just 1 page of their huge menu to gluten free offerings (or even just provide a gluten free salad dressing??).  If other large chains (like CPK) and even small ""mom & pop"" restaurants are willing & able to make this effort for their customers, it is upsetting that a giant like The Cheesecake Factory is making no effort whatsoever.  I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=420

Ryan G.,"San Francisco, CA",10,154,,3.0,12/11/2007,"Size MATTERS. Especially here in some obscene manner, anything you order will come in large portions. Large enough that if two of you are not super hungry, can probably split one meal and still have ROOM for cheesecake.  Cheescake Factory is in the Village, in Corte Madera. One of only a few food options when shopping here, they did away with the mall-like food court, in order to enhance the quality of this PLACE. While you can expect a wait during most busy times: sunny shopping days, weekend nights and during the HOLIDAYS. Wait is not to bad, and they give you one of those remote, vibrating disc things that alerts you that your wait is over.  Really need to work on the range of these. Confined to sitting within a few yards of the front door. Tried to put it to the test by sitting near Nordstrom's, bad CHOICE. Moving along... Seating is plentiful, the booths can feel a little packed when there are 4 adults and expanding waist lines. If you are impatient on waiting, snag one of the table tops or bar space and order off the full menu. Once seated you are greeted with the most insanely packed menu. 8+ pages with colored ADVERTISEMENTS for plastic surgery (oddly enough!) to vacations. First few pages are alcohol. Make a decision and move onto the food.  My strategy here is to rule out whole categories of food, like say pasta or salad. And then try and choose. My safe pick was fish tacos. Nice to get a choice Albacore or Mahi Mahi. Along came my plate full of 3 fat tacos. Finished ONE and hit a wall.  All the burgers looked decent enough, and the Crispy Cajun Littles (chicken fingers!) was insane. Fried pieces everywhere, huge lump of mashed potatoes. Guess you can be good and substitute for some broccoli, smothered in BUTTER. A coronary awaits you here! If you were able to finish your meal. Cheesecake awaits you here.

Unfamiliar with the culinary offerings in Corte Madera, we settled on Cheesecake Factory. ""For reals?"" I questioned hubby. ""For real!"" he replied. So in we went...and was told to wait around 30 minutes. 30 more minutes to try different chairs, stare at the table, imagine it in our dining room. Restoration Hardware is such a temptress...ahem...and a story, err review for another time. As for Cheesecake Factory, I had forgotten how extensive a menu it has! Seems like there's definitely Asian and Italian leanings. Although I went with my safe choice-- neither here nor there-- a yummy jambalaya. Hubby had a tougher time deciding between two dishes: steak and steak. Okay, to be more precise, it was a fight between ribeye and Hibachi. Now, I thought Hibachi was an old TV brand or some kind of crappy outdoor grill, but never knew it could describe a steak. And from hubby's expression (quite the self-proclaimed steak connoisseur by the way) he was pleasantly surprised! Tangy, sweet but not too sweet, smoky, tender wonderful steak!! Almost as good as my jambalaya. And it was accompanied by a large yummy mound of garlic mashed potatoes. Yum! So all in all, not too bad for a chain. And a very good meal.

I made a huge mistake by not finding out what my server's name was but all i know is that she was AMAZING! She had long curly brownish hair and was probably in her early twenties. She made sure that we had bread on the table, drinks were filled and even gave us the status of our order since it took a little longer. Its amazing how wonderful a dining experience can be when you have a server who's attentive & friendly. She was great.  My little girl is at that age where she hates sitting still... oh and lucky us, she HATES high chairs. I asked for some crayons and paper but  was told they didn't have any. I mean, really? You have a kids menu but no crayons or paper? We weren't expecting to eat out but now I know that if we ever go to a cheesecake factory again, we'd have to bring our  own supplies. Which is fine but slightly disappointing.  Also, the touch faucet in the bathroom is so irritating. I was holding my daughter and every time I would touch the faucet & put her hands under there, it stopped.

YOU HAVE A FAN UP HERE!) But I digress (visions of chili cheese fries... mmmmmm...) The Cheesecake Factory was a treat back then, but after the last few times I've been there, it's become less of a treat and more of a place where I eat too much Chili's style food. You will not be disappointed if all you are expecting is an OK, somewhat fancy-schmancy sandwich. I suggest getting half a salad at lunchtime, or sharing one, and then getting the cheesecake (but don't get the banana- too fakey tasting.) Speaking of the cheesecake, how many of you have not thought about laying down under the whipped cream machine with your mouth wide open??? Mmmmm... whipped cream... But I digress (geez, I'm distracted tonight.)

Since I have never tried the cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory I ordered a piece of the Original with the Strawberry glaze to take with me as well. I have to say that when I did finally try it, I kind of didn't like it so much. It tasted salty to me. I think maybe it was the sour cream layer that grossed me out.  Whatever it was, I didn't care for it and threw most of the cake out. Obviously, lots of people love the cheesecake so it must just be me. I had the same experience with that movie the Professional. Most people love that movie, but I hate that it, and imagine now that my personal hell might be where it plays on a loop while Marin mothers serve me Cheesecake Factory cheesecake from atop of their double-wide baby strollers.

Diana H.,"Berkeley, CA",14,93,,4.0,10/20/2007,"I'm sorry, but I like this place. The portions are famously huge, yes. A pasta dish will comfortably serve two people. I don't really think that's BAD...it's just something to be aware of. I hardly ever even make it to desert. It's a chain, which I don't like, and there are ads in the menu (eeeew) which adds to the overall tackiness already put in place by the bizarre decorum (pastel roman impressionist mother's day card trying to be romantic...?) But, well... The actual FOOD is quite good. Their meat is cooked right, and the flavors are usually well-rounded (if a twinge, eh, fatty).  They also have a very, very large menu, which I love. There's something here for everyone. I hate restaurants that offer 6 entrees on their menu. Not here, my friends. For this, It's a great place to go with a group.  I think the prices are very, very fair. You can get a sandwich that will last you through tonight and tomorrow's lunch for 10 dollars.  It's also one of the ONLY places in Marin county that's open past 10. Did you hear that?  at 11 o'clock on a Friday, it's this or Dennys. Don't put it out of your mind as a late night spot to get chow that won't give you acid reflux, constipation and nightmares. I think people need to ease up on this place. Also, a note on their meat: Their chicken is natural and free range. No hormones or antibiotics. Yea, ask your favorite diner if their chickens were treated better then most--and whether or not by eating that chicken sandwich you will be consuming the hormones, anitbiotics and preservatives that were added to the meat before and after it was killed. Their beef, I'm not so sure about. It' s all USDA grade A (some of it even Kobe)...which, I guess means happier, healthier cows, for a happier, healthier you, but all meat companies ever talk about is the marbling...not whether nasty hormones/checmicals were added. The Cheesecake factory should be supported for offering higher quality meat than most restaurants...including non-chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=440

Valerie C.,"San Francisco, CA",213,137,43,2.0,5/16/2008,"As I sit here picking at the remnants of a Cheesecake Factory Chicken Madeira, I have to say that this is one of those few occasions where the food tastes better a day later. I mean, you know how food quality is supposed to be sub-par when served as leftovers? Well in my case, the mediocre food I had last night is still mediocre today. And since I anticipated a change (for the worse) in taste and instead was greeted by the same oversalted mashed potatoes and overdone cheese I had at my bff's graduation dinner last night, by default my expectations were exceeded. But enough with my attempt at being philosophical about the Cheesecake Factory; bottom line is: I DON'T SEE MYSELF EVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN. I didn't even want to waste my time yelping about a chain, but a'las the experience I had last night had to be one of the worst I've had for this restaurant chain (I've been ones in Palo Alto, San Francisco, Sacramento and Waikiki).  I come here out of comfort: I LOVE the calamari and the bread service is pretty good (although I usually skip the sourdough and go straight for the brown loaf), and if I didn't manage to stuff myself with the above PLUS an entre, I definitely go for a slice of cheesecake. Last night was no different.  Our party of eight was seated on the patio, which we surprisingly did not have to wait long for. (The weather was GORGEOUS!) However, it was obvious the service would be slow from that point forward as our server had to have had half the tables (something like 8-10 parties).  We started off with appetizers (calamari and the spinach dip) which took longer than it should have to come out. I KNOW both could have been served better, as the calamari came out as one solid battered mess and the spinach dip required you to crack through the heatlamp-dried top to reach what should have been the creamy dip. The bread came out sometime after that, and then the food, which I mentioned earlier. We decided for some cheesecake (after all, it's not made onsite anyway) so we weren't really disappointed with that. The best part of my experience had to be my company. Oh, and the beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=460

Then about 15 Mins. later, she came to our table and introduced our new waiter, a guy, who only checked on us once! (WTF?) Watever, This review is all about the food! I got the Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Madeira With the sauces on the side. Soooo Good! My Sister got the Mahi Mahi Mediterranean.. and by the looks of the the fish was very fresh and it really smelled good, my mom got the California Cheesesteak ( I know right, ya go ALL the way here just to order Cheesesteak moms?!

As we sat on a table, another hostess came over to us and told us to move that the section that we were seating was not open. She then took us to the waiting area for more time , and she went on to take a recently arrived party to the table that she had told us to move from. She then walked away while other hostesses continued to seat other customers with pagers that arrived at the restaurant after us.

Sammy S.,"Oakland, CA",366,281,22,3.0,11/6/2006,"I'm not really a big fan of the cheesecake factory. The portions of food are absolutely ridiculous. Like there is this Asian salad that has crunchies piled on top, that is seriously as tall as the leaning tower of Pisa. Who really needs that much food I ask? (and believe me, I love huge portions, but this is unreal). And do you notice who is eating at the Cheesecake factory? Mommies who take their little kids here during a day of shopping. These poor kids are being breed to think like fat kids. After enough visits to the cheesecake factory they will begin to think ""hey, this is a normal sized meal,"" then they'll start complaining about the too-small portions you serve them at home.   I'm also freaked out by the all-white attire worn by the staff. White is the most impractical color to wear in a restaurant. It's just a recipe for a big, ugly disaster that there is no way to cover up. The ambiance is totally tacky and over the top. It looks like a restaurant in a Vegas hotel, with all the cheesy murals and chandeliers.   I actually think the food is not bad and I come here for lunch once in a while if I'm in the hood, and by in the hood, I mean shamelessly shopping at the yuppiest outdoor ""shopping center"" aka mall in town. So the lunch food is ok, but the cheesecakes here are fucking great. I try to get ones that aren't too complex, because if you add too much to you're cheesecake, it basically becomes something else. But I'm a huge fan of the banana cream cheesecake. Out of this world I tell you. Just like Evie!  Side bar that indicates I may start eating like the fat kids at the Cheesecake factory:  Last week we celebrated my father's birthday, which happens to fall on Halloween. So not only had I already eaten more candy in one night than an entire year (I'm usually not that into candy), but my mom had picked up a traditional old fashion cheesecake. I only ate a tiny slice, but this weekend, while my parents were out of town, I decided to eat one of the left over pieces. As I started to dig in, I began eying the left over Halloween candy, picturing how amazing it would be if I crumbled bits of Twix on top of the cheesecake. I mean, the Cheesecake factory would do it, actually I think they do, but with Snickers. I walked back and forth to the bucket of candy three or four times before I decided it would be way too disgusting to do what I was daydreaming about. See, just ordering food from the restaurant take-out style leaves me with fat kid mentality. I think I need a break from the factory.

FYI:  I looked at my leftovers a few days later and noticed the 1/2 of the fries I didn't finish weren't there.  I'm a little bummed, but I won't change the rating.  However, I would suggest checking your ""to go"" box after they pack it before you leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=500

Kris O.,"San Rafael, CA",473,133,129,3.0,9/19/2008,"I remember back in 2004 when this place was being built and how much of a big deal this joint was going to be, and since their opening in I have been a guest here on several occasions. I have tried numerous appetizers, salads, small plates, pastas, pizzas, sandwiches, cocktails and cheesecakes over the years and Its always been sort of the same thing. My opinion on this establishment fluctuates all the time I either hate it or I love it dearly. What I don't like about this restaurant is that it is busy most of the time and they always seems to sit you somewhere that isn't very comfortable. I disapprove of a restaurant that dares calls themselves the ""Cheesecake Factory"" and doesn't make their own cheesecakes. I found out that they are shipped there every morning and all that is actually made there is the food itself. Now over time I have had really great waiters and really bad ones some are absolutely on their game and ready to assist you. Some have seemed disinterested in what they do or have creeped me out a little. There portions are huge and basically you will want to split some of their items with a friend or date, I could not even imagine eating it all by myself. Now what I do like is that the cheesecakes are good, filling but good. I always love there bread that they bring out right when you get there, its so damn good. I like there new introductions to a Tapas menu so you can eat here now without spending an arm and leg and they are small so you don't leave feeling like a fat cow. I like there smoothies, and coffee items also they make wonderful cocktails (when I drank) with a full bar with many options.

ashley l.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/4/2007,"I was among the first people to be hired to work at this place. I was hired before it was even built.  The first day it opened we had 20 or more EX-CCF employees picketing our front doors. I should have taken the hint then and left.  The food here is terrible for the price For one the portions are HUGE. That is something that this place takes pride in. But I think its unhealthy. It just encourages people to eat appetizers the size of two meals. Then the meals themselves are so huge it would feed my whole family. Beyond that the food is extremely fatty, e.g. Fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls ... Despite how hard I worked and all the heavy lifting I did, when I was gone, I had gained a ton of weight and 6 months later I had lost 40 lbs by just not eating there anymore.   Beyond that the food itself is just mediocre. I don't know why anyone would pay $20 for something that I could make at home from a box in a fraction of the time it takes to go there, wait for a table and then wait for the food. Its really not worth it.  Another point is a good portion of the food is taken from other restaurants, they even admit it, they have us sing the burger king song to remember the ingrediants on one of their burgers. They have $6 burger type things from Carl's Jr. except a little bit taller and they charge $15. Even working there and getting a 50% discount on the food the only thing I could really afford was a burger or pizza or an appetizer on what they paid me. Trust me, the food is crap for what you are paying for it.  The service is terrible, and you know why? they can't keep anyone there longer than a few months. I was only there 6 or 7 months and I still outlasted several of their managers. No one that I started with is still there, not even the manager who hired me. When I put this place on resumes I have to write that my managers are no longer there so there is really no point in calling for a reference. IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN OPEN 3 YEARS!!!!

We had a couple of occasions to be in Corte Madera around lunchtime this fall, and ended up one time at The Factory. Well, of course I always am leery about a place with 3,000+ calorie meal options, but there it was in the middle of the menu book, SALADS! Actual healthy salad options. I went for Chinese chicken salad, the small one please with dressing on the side. It was surprisingly good, with crisp greens and noodles, lean chicken, and herbed just to my liking!  While perusing the menu I also discovered several other items for non-gluttons, including sandwich and dinner plate options that were not overly carbiferous. My wife and daughter loved their entree (enough for two) and we seemed to be in some kind of time warp as we were served our drinks almost as soon as we sat down and our lunch in what seemed like just a few minutes... a lot faster then I remember for Cheesecake Factory. Maybe it's just this location. Maybe they have to bring it up a notch for the fussy Main crowd. I don't know. I do know I'll try them again and let you all know if this was just a fluke. In any case, as of today, I'm a fan.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera

Oren H.,"San Francisco, United States",136,10,,1.0,6/11/2017,"How can it be possible that this place is still open? To be quite honest I try to not be negative and write bad reviews and I am always the person fighting to give servers larger tips but this may top one of the lesser experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I came into the restaurant, was seated right away because it was a very slow night (probably for good reason - others know what I did not). My server came over - seemed very nice - I placed my order and then that is where the fun starts. For the next 35 minutes (and I know it was this long because I made a call right after I ordered so I checked what the time was when I made the call) on a slow night, I did not see my server, my food, nada. Glass was empty. I had to get out of my seat to go ask another waitress to see if she could help find my server and my food. She comes back a few minutes later to tell me they burnt it so they are remaking the dish.  My server finally shows up with the food and asked me ""how do those look?"" I responded ""they look fine it's the first I have seen them"". She said she had them remake them because the first order was burnt. By the way they were the Cajun Chicken Littles. I greatly appreciate that they remade my order but I am not sure I need to be grateful that the process took 35 minutes when the restaurant was dead and it was their mistake. No manager ever came over to discuss what happened (the waitress that went to solve the riddle earlier implied one might). No apology for the long wait time was vet made. Still glass is empty. Finally some water arrives. Hallelujah.  I finish my meal and then the bill comes. Not only was there no considerations for the 40 minutes of my life that was wasted but the charge was even more than the menu price. I asked if I could swap mashed potatoes for asparagus. Reply ""Sure no problem"".  The bill had a $4 additional charge which was never mentioned. Moral of this whole story is I have no idea why I didn't ask for a manager. I have no idea why I left even a penny for a tip but left a tip (reduced but nonetheless) and I am writing this to warn everyone that the way this place is being run is absolute dog s*^%. There are plenty of amazing restaurants with great service so don't waste your precious hours walking through the doors of this sadly run establishment.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera

Me and my boyfriend love Cheesecake Factory and we decided to grab dinner at this location tonight. When we came in we put our names in and they told us that it would be about 20 minutes. About 35 minuets later our buzzer finally went off and we turned it in to the hostess and waited for her to bring us to our table. Not only did they never bring us to our table after turning our buzzer in, they proceeded to seat many other people. Within the next 20 minutes after, we checked in with them again to see what was taking so long and they had no record of our names and tried telling us that that we hadn't even put our names in, making it seem like it was our fault. We looked passed this and they then told us that we would be first on the list, alas that was not true either considering we waited another 20 minutes and did not get seated... We decided to leave and now are on our way to another restaurant. UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED.

To top it all off he gave us two hot towels to clean our hands after the meal and somehow my hands felt softer and cleaner than they have in years (I'm not kidding, I made that exact comment at the table). As usual the food was good and the portions were large. I got the chicken parmesan pizza style which was tasty and the wife got a pear and blue cheese flatbread which she loved.

On top of this our waiter made some excuse about how the kitchen never tells customers what they don't have and other sites are better.

Madelyn A.,"Cotati, United States",9,53,2,5.0,9/9/2017,"My review is for our amazing waiter, Scott. He's been my server a few times over the years and had I known his name before our most recent visit, I would have written this review sooner.  Scott is ALWAYS on top of it with refilling water, which is always a great thing when I'm at a restaurant because I love to drink ice cold water and seem overindulge on it. He's attentive -- greeting us as we sit down, taking our order, bread, a plate of strawberries for our toddler, etc. He jokes -- I asked for no egg in my salad. So, when he's repeating back our order to confirm, Scott jokingly said I asked for extra egg  Our last visit Scott was amazing because we were daringly out to eat as a family with our newborn. He doted on her, telling us about his 2 kids. The baby started to get restless during dinner and he recognized that and helped us get our food boxed up as quickly as possible. We were getting cake to go bc it was our older daughter's birthday and he treated us to a dessert as a congratulations for the baby. Totally unexpected but such a nice gesture. Scott is hands down one of the best servers I've ever had and I really hope he gets recognized for his hard work.  I'll add, close to a couple of years ago I was out to dinner at Cheesecake with an old friend who is known to be high maintenance at restaurants. Scott was our server at the time. I'll never forget this meal because I was actually embarrassed by her behavior toward him. She had special requests with everything she ordered because of whatever diet she was on at the time and its restrictions. She wasn't considerate or appreciative toward him for his work to make sure her meal was correct. He very much went above and beyond to accommodate her. Long and short of this story, he was smiles and rainbows and didn't miss a beat while dealing with my difficult companion.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=20

Tim B.,"Novato, United States",70,279,8,4.0,1/1/2017,"So one of our gifts for Christmas was $100 in gift cards for the Cheesecake Factory. I say two as the giver felt it necessary to split the $100 in two, just in case we wanted to split up and visit the chain on separate occasions. It's allright, it's ok... We wound up visiting just three days after the national holiday, arriving at about 5:30. Granted it was in the middle of that holiday week between Christmas and New Years, but the place was hoppin. Fortunately we were able to get a table quickly without a reservation, although there were a lot of larger groups waiting for a table. A taste of familiarity occurred when we realized the woman walking us to our table used to work at another restaurant we frequent. Upon this, she had our server 'treat us extra special'. That's nice - and to be fair he did check on us often, although all of that could have fallen by the wayside if they had just remembered to give us forks so that we didn't feel obligated to ask for them. Sidebar: Why is it that many restaurants don't seem to pay much attention to obvious details such as... silverware? Are they really paranoid about people stealing the semi-precious metal? As to the meal itself - well, one can never fault this chain for lack of choice. I enjoyed the Cajun pasta, washed down with a Lost Coast IPA, whereas the missus relished her falafel pasta and iced tea. Food came promptly and went down smoother than a Santana/Rob Thomas collaboration. Dessert was the Kahlua cheesecake, which was predictably sumptuous.  Entire bill came to a mere 67 smackers - considering that accounted for two people's meals, drinks and desserts, not too shabby.

Unfortunately for me, once I arrived at home I saw they scraped off the Bavarian cream and not the large mountain of whip cream on the cheesecake.

Darlene C.,"Napa, United States",23,164,105,1.0,17/7/2016,"RECOMMENDATION:  Definitely steer clear from THIS particular CF (usually a crowd-pleaser kind of staple when we can't decide what we want) - it is so poorly run, its really SAD.   FAILURE OF CORPORATE:  I mean, these gorgeous places cost millions to build and it's like they aren't even giving their staff food service training 101, so they have tools to be successful and I get the impression from the wait staff that the kitchen causes a lot of the problem.  TRAIN them, please. Their timing is TERRIBLE.  It took us 10 just to be greeted and put in a drink order.  Whomever actually checks in on social media for CF, I hope to God you're paying attention to the sentiment of your most recent crappy reviews:  there's a reason. OUR ISSUE:  (this time? aside from the poor service) Limp, just past raw potato, fries - a simple ""extra crispy"" request and they weren't even close.  And a veggie burger that was so undercooked, it presented like raw (albeit veggie) hamburger that broke apart and fell from the bun every time I took a bite:  the only reason I ate it (with a FORK!) was because I knew I would be there another hour waiting for someone to come and re-fire it for me ... Aside from that, they forgot the lemons for my daughter's salmon, we had to beg for water and iced tea refills, and it took 20 minutes to get the fries re-fried that I gave up even wanting, because the excitement of excellent fries anticipation was long passed and then I was all agro at what was supposed to be an awesome start of my shopping trip with my 19-year-old. SUMMARY:  Bummed because it really turns me off from CF's in general, thinking that they all might be run like this one, and why bother, when you're busting out $50 for lunch.  Oh yeah, and when I asked for a manager the collective looks from the busser and the hostess up front, chatting, was like ""I have no idea what you're talking about - manager? what's THAT?""  The adult busser looked at the teenage hostess and said, I guess she's IT!""  Ridiculous.  Sad.  Get your sh*# together Cheesecake Factory!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=60

Despite many people on the floor, we were told by everyone ""it's the end of my shift I'm leaving."" My suggestion to the management would be to a) stagger the start/end times of shifts, b) have a dedicated hh server, c) explain to employees that they can't be so rude. Finally, one server who told us he was supposed to be leaving took all 3 tables orders, and acted like he was doing us a big favor.

Sylvia L.,"Novato, United States",89,172,66,4.0,26/4/2017,"This is your typical Cheesecake factory. I have only eaten at a couple, but there are many and they all look like this one. It's just pretty average. They were real busy and we had to wait about 20 min. Which is not bad if you're expecting it. There's places to walk around and sit outside, so it's not that bad. They told us it would be about 20 min and it was pretty spot on. It may have been faster, but it definitely wasn't longer. I honestly don't remember what I ordered so it must not have been very memorable. I think it was chicken pot pie. The dessert was the black tie cheesecake, iirc. It had a vanilla mouse and chocolate. Of course, it was bomb as hell. This is not a place I go often, since I do tend to avoid crowds, and try to eat healthy,  but it's fun for a day when you're cheating on your diet and want to have a comforting meal. I have nothing bad to say about it. Then again, my expectations are pretty low when it comes to these types of places.

Jenna L.,"El Sobrante, United States",0,54,20,1.0,4/6/2017,"Horrible. Everything. We ordered 2 salads and a lettuce wrap & we waited an hour for it. When they brought it to us they tried to sugar coat it and say the shrimp took a long time...cooking shrimp should take no more than 10 min & that would be over cooked, so I don't buy that. They comped our cheesecake but in my opinion, they should have done more. We were there for almost 2 hours to have a simple lunch. And even with all the waiting they didn't come by our table to make sure we were ok or anything, awful service. Just awful. We saw friends walk into the plaza and they said they were going to boudin next door (mind you we'd already been there 40 min). They went in, order, ate and left and we were just finishing our food when they left. Ridiculous. Save yourself time, money & anger and do NOT go here.

Erin K.,"San Francisco Bay Area, United States",49,289,190,4.0,2/4/2016,"*VEGAN* & gluten free review: I referenced PETA's guide before coming so that I would have a good idea of what I could/could not eat. According to the guide, the Cheesecake Factory has a lot of items that are vegan-friendly that are not just salads (see list below); however, I decided to just go for a salad anyways and got the ""Super Antioxidant Salad"" with the dressing on the side, which is under the ""Super Food"" page in the menu. It was legit so good. Dressing was on point, almonds, roasted pears, kale, blueberries, etc... so yummy. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed my meal, because chain restaurants don't cater to vegans and special ordering something always turns out way bland. I didn't even have to special order here! I highly recommend this salad for vegans/nonvegans/people who want a salad option.  Here is a copy/paste from PETA's vegan guide of options from Cheesecake Factory.

Destinee Y.,"Davis, United States",52,13,5,2.0,6/3/2017,"I came to this location at dinner for a friends birthday hoping to have a nice and fun night and unfortunately our whole group left extremely disappointed.  I have a relatively long list of issues I had while there so I'll just start from the beginning.  Firstly we were seated at a dirty table that took waayyy too long after we were seated to be cleared. Our server Hannah H finally brought us bread and DIRTY plates said she would be back to take our drink orders and then disappeared for a good 20 minutes, long story short she took the dirty plates back and never brought new ones out. We got the mac and cheese balls and a side of asparagus as an appetizer. SIDENOTE the asparagus side was $6.95 for 5 soggy unseasoned cold pieces of asparagus... what. It was an hour and a half after we arrived that we finally got our food. The appetizers (cold) came with the main dishes -- the plates were obviously sitting under a warmer forever before being brought out to us. I ordered a burger with a side salad, and didn't receive the salad until after myself and everyone else in my group was done with our entrees, keep in mind the salad was literally just spring mix drenched in balsamic vinaigrette. Our water cups were only refilled once after being directly asked for a refill. Overall it was just a really lame experience, we were so so neglected which is totally unacceptable. Hopefully this can be taken constructively and changes can be made to ensure better service in the future.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=80

Lizette R.,"Sonoma, United States",0,7,,1.0,7/10/2017,"I have been here MULTIPLE times over the years and I have NEVER had a bad experience until today. If I could give their manager and Michelle zero stars I would. We got here at 4:30 pm and we did not get out until 7:15...WHY?? Because apparently they had just changed their menu and ""the kitchen was having a hard time with it"". There were seven of us, and two of us didn't even get our food until everybody else was done eating. One of the late plates came with white rice that was absolutely dry....how you mess up steamed rice is beyond me but whatever. It happened. This wasn't even the worst part. Our server, Michelle, was absolutely flustered. She just could not handle her work and it was showing and we weren't even that needy of a table, but she only refilled our waters twice in the TWO HOURS AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES we were forced to endure her service.  Anybody would become annoyed by waiting for so long to just receive food and the check. We were pissed especially after a long day in the city. When the checks came, she messed it ALL up. Again, how she did it was beyond me. We had three tags already separated And we had all put our cards down with the correct receipts, but when she came back they were all completely swapped and some of us paid more than we even had to. I understand splitting tags is hard. Ok. But She didn't even apologize for all the inconvenience. She managed to blame the kitchen for late food and get pissed at the fact that we were beyond annoyed with the service. She was rude to us as if we were the inconvenience!!! After speaking to Luis, the manager TWICE he said the best he could do was comp dessert.....of all the things he could of done he thought that was his best option?? Not even a coupon to return not even a free meal that was over 45-minutes late, not even an apology!! This was absurd. Absolute WORST service I have ever experienced here, and let me reiterate that it has never, never, never, been this terrible. It wasn't even busy when we arrived and because of there inability to provide good customer service, we had a great day ruined by a terrible attitude and a manager who can barely manage.

Super jazzed to be working there, went over some of her favorites and was fantastic on refills! We loved her! She knew that menu very well! We went with the Shepard's Pie, which my husband says was fantastic! I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club, it did not disappoint. Bacon was crispy and avocado was fresh!! I had the Flavored Iced Tea and it was amazing. I must of had 3 refills from poor Michelle. But she had a smile the whole time!!

The only thing I would say that needs better attention was the bathroom, it was dirty. Toliet paper, paper towels and seat covers all over. It had rusty hinges  on the doors, it needs to be looked at ASAP. If I had gone to the bathroom first I may not have eaten there. That's the only reason they are getting 4 stars and not 5.

Jeannie T.,"Oakland, United States",90,226,915,4.0,9/2/2016,"Came by to eat at the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I came with a group of 7 people. It wasn't as busy since it was a Monday so we only had to wait a few minutes for them to push some tables together for us. Our server, I believe his name was Theo, was on the younger side so it was easy for our table to joke around with him. We started with the fried calamari, avocado eggrolls, firecracker salmon, and buffalo wings. The fried clamari is always good, especially when they serve them with the tentacles, my favorite part. It had a light batter and was cooked well. The avocado eggrolls are also a must. I prefer the avocado eggrolls from Cheesecake Factory over the ones from CPK. The perfect amount of avocado with bits of sun-dried tomato, red onion, and cilantro, perfectly fried up in a crisp wrapper. It comes with a tamarind cashew dipping sauce. Kinda weird but when paired together, it works. The firecracker salmon was a new appetizer that I'd never tried. It's salmon rolled in spinach and fried in a crisp wrapper. I thought it was pretty good. And the buffalo wings had a nice crunch. It had nice meaty pieces but wasn't overly dry. The crust wasn't too heavy and it was executed well. The crust stayed put with the chicken when you bit into it. Definitely my kind of chicken wing, though I'm more of drumstick person. As far as entrees go, I really should've shared a dish because I was so full just from the appetizers, but I ended up with the Chinese chicken salad and my boyfriend got the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic. The Chinese chicken salad is literally my go to dish whenever I venture out to the Cheesecake Factory. It never disappoints and I love the dressing. It's the perfect a amount of tang with a crunch from the rice noodles, almonds, and crisp wontons.  I also tried the Farfalle that my boyfriend ordered. It's actually really good. It's bow-tie pasta with chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas, and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce. The roasted garlic-Parmesan cream sauce was what made the dish perfect. But the cream sauce is a bit on the heavy side, so it's difficult to take in if you've already downed 2 mai tai's like my boyfriend and guy friends were doing. Especially before you've even eaten anything. So we ended up taking that to go.  For dessert, we asked Theo to surprise us because everything looked so good and we couldn't decide on which cheesecake to order. What came out was a s'mores cheesecake and it was the bomb. It was like a heaven on a plate with melted marshmallows, ice cream, and graham crackers. It's so good. You have to try it.  The only small tid bit that I had was that the bread was a bit hard when they brought it out. Almost as if they gave us leftover bread that had been sitting out but was just warmed up to hide the fact that it wasn't fresh. But all of our appetizers made up for it. So it wasn't that big of a deal.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=80

Carol M.,"Windsor, United States",3,67,,1.0,22/11/2016,"Wow! Been going to this location for years. It represents a bit of a 'ritual' when we are in that area. We always like to go there to be able to bring some amazing Cheesecake home. Went there Sunday night with 3 other people. The wait was relatively short. We asked to be placed in booth as we do grow tired of a table that isn't picked up or cleared during the course of the meal. No booth when there were several unoccupied. But, we have always overlooked this as the Chicken Bellagio is so unique and the Artichoke appetizer is back on the menu. The Food overall is so good! The menu so diverse with so many choices!!!!! We were seated, our wait person introduced himself. We ordered the Calamari and Artichoke as appetizers. Both were delicious. No change in plates, from tiny bread plates with butter wrappers. Are we expected to reach over each other to eat or dip into the sauces? We asked (after I returned a dirty knife) politely, this happens, for other plates. We were asked 'what size'? These were delivered by another waitperson filling in for the first one. The other plates weren't removed. There we go again with a table so crowded, with water, beverages, appetizers, bread plates, silverware that there was no room. We were trying not to get upset by any of this, just ignored it and wanted to focus on enjoying ourselves.  On top of everything else, and it wasn't packed in there, our meals came out and were plopped on the table with this mess by someone else who wouldn't give us time to move the other things. Just set them on the edge of the table and scurried off.  We hadn't had a chance to eat the appetizers. We aren't chronic complainers, don't except a crumbsweeping person. I don't expect a plate of hot food to be handed across my friend's face to reach me. It table was so crowded that we were trying not to knock anything over. I tried 'stacking' a few plates up to make room hoping that someone would notice and didn't until we said something again. By the time we finished the appetizers the food was tepid. We ordered several pieces of that Wonderful Cheesecake to go. We had to plead to get containers for our unfinished dinners. The person brought out small containers which wouldn't have held the food. I asked for larger containers. The waitperson 'smirked' and asked what size do you want? Most waitstaff personnel look at a table and assess these things. We left, still having enjoyed one another, but the experience required much overlooking. For a place so popular, one would have hoped that the 'ratings' would reflect this.

He took drink orders and didn't offer appetizer. So, we just decided to ask him to take our order of appetizer. He left and came back 20 min later to take our food order . We finish our appetizer and we had to ask for refills and more bread.  Our food arrives, we decide to wait for our bread and drinks. It never arrived. We just decided to eat our meal. Many workers including management walk by multiple times. No one ever bothered to ask if we were okay or if we needed anything. The next time we saw our server after asking for bread and drinks was when he drop off the check. I work in the hospitality industry myself and I can understand a busy day but, he and all the staff completely ignored us. I left a tip just because I know servers live out of tips but I will never be coming here and I will tell my friends and family about my experience. Mediocre service no thank you ill rather go to a McDonalds if that what I was looking for .",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=120

Pretty sad but i guess i cannot expect too much from a chain restaurant -.- One thing the waiter was right about though. Their lunch portions are big and their dinner portions are even bigger. Although the portions are pretty filling it was still the standard ok go to food when you have step in laws who are ubber picky about what they eat.

It has been some time since I've eaten at a CF....not a big fan of chain mall food. It certainly hasn't changed in the years, a 20-30 minute way, bad food and you are looking at a 2 hour meal time.  My friend ordered the burger which was chewy and way too salty (this from a girl who salts everything). The fries tasted of old grease/oil. None of us had more than 2.  The Orange chicken was dry and chewy (yes just like the burger) The rice was sticky and crunchy (like plastic).  Unfortunately ,the only thing I wanted was soup, the Clam Chowder didn't sound appealing, they only have one soup a day even in the rainy winter months. I simply opted for Ginger Ale and a wait until we got home.  Sadly, the food was so disappointing, the service took forever, that  we opted to skip desert and get the heck out of this place.

You can have a great waiter, or one that could care less.  Unfortunately, tonight we got one that didn't seem to like her job and had no desire to be there.  As for us, we drove 2 hours to get to the restaurant and then waited 40 minutes to get a table.  (We were starving as we hadn't eaten all day.)  However, once we were finally seated, we waited another 20 minutes and never saw a waitress. We had to get up and find a waitress!  When one finally arrived, we asked her to bring lots of bread, water and a passion ice tea.  That could be done in about 5 minutes, right?  No such luck. People who had a different waitress and were seated long after we were, got their drinks and appetizers before our waitress ever came to our table!  I had to get up from the table to go find a waitress, then had to get up again to ask for a manager, when our waitress never showed.   The manager (Julian?) was very apologetic and compt'd us dessert and even delivered a free soup and salad (that we didn't eat), but the service never got any better.  Our waitress had ruined what was supposed to be a special night out.  By the way, our total time from arrival to leaving was over 2 hours to 2 1/2 hours.    I love their avocado egg rolls ($11), chicken madeira ($18), and bang, bang chicken and shrimp ($18).

Daniel W.,"Los Angeles, United States",287,209,50,4.0,16/11/2014,"First, I have to say I resisted this restaurant for a long time.  I went to the original Cheesecake Factory when it was a small place in Beverly Hills, and they always had OK food at inflated prices. The new restaurants, big and a bit gaudy, always had ridiculously long wait times with no reservations and those stupid beeper things that meant you had to stay within 100 feet when they could be using text messaging to let you know when your table is ready. I had some bad experiences here early on, freezing in the back round room while waiters changed and forgot to bring food, etc. All that said--the food is actually quite good, and almost always enough for two meals--so you can take half home. The menu, of course, is so big that everyone can find something that interests them, italian, mexican, american, asian... vegetarian, cheese, meat, fish... I've yet to have a meal that wasn't good here. Not the very best, but always good. The fish 'n chips are standouts. And this is the big thing--there are very, very few late night restaurants in Marin. Most of the county closes down by 9pm at the latest. The earliest this restaurant closes is 10pm on Sunday nights. Monday through Thursday it's open till 11pm, and Friday's it's midnight. That's when the Cheesecake factory is best--late in the evening. You don't have to fight for parking (not enough mall parking in the day). You don't have to wait for an hour or more for a table as you do during more popular hours. ----- IMPORTANT LATE NIGHT TIP: I went there after a premiere of a movie I co-wrote and act in,   and arrived on a Thursday at 10:50pm.  The man at the front desk told me the kitchen was closed. But it doesn't really close till 11, and with a nice, ""pretty please"" from me he let me sit down, and the waitress was fine with it, as was the kitchen.  So if you arrive close to the posted closing time, ask nicely to be seated even if they try to dissuade you (which is kind of odd, but oh, well).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=140

It's the first time anybody offered to do this for us and now I know why! Usually try bring one and it real apple juice. I also ordered the stuffed mushrooms with the wine sauce I've eaten it many times and this time there was no wine in it.

Because of what she said I asked for 1 more container of raspberry sauce and thought that would be cool. Few things I noticed after I left.. The last sauce I asked for, container was 1/5 full no joke. She swirled it so it looked full when she gave it to me. I know because I looked at the other 2 before paying. I also realized they charged me $10 for ""1 pint"" of sauce.

I have to say, it's definitely not up to par with other cheesecake factory. We were seated within 20 minutes on a Saturday night which was a miracle. Our waiter immediately took our drink orders and deliver them promptly. Being on weight watchers we ordered off the skinny licious menu. We ordered a mozzarella flatbread, and then we each ordered a salad: I got the Asian salad and my boyfriend ordered the Mexican tortilla salad. This is where it all started to go bad. Our waiter came back and told us they were completely out of flatbreads. You would think he might've known. However since he didn't, we changed our order to shrimp spring rolls. They were just okay. Not much shrimp and one of the rolls was not put together properly and just fell apart. Next up was our salads and the waiter came over to ask me if I minded if the dressing was on the salad. I told him of course I minded because I needed to have the dressing on the side as I indicated to him when I ordered. We waited an additional 20 minutes while they redid my salad. The salads were good: I can't say they weren't! But again this place is not customer service friendly. They gather a crowd and they know they will so they don't have to put much into it.

I am in my 40's and have never had food at a restaurant that was so bad it had to be returned in all the years I've dined out. I'm not a nit picky person. 2. The experience tonight was so bad I opened a Yelp profile  Got seated at 6:30 for a couple burgers and a burrito (table of 3). After placing the order, which included two burgers, medium rare, no ""special"" sauce, we were served at 7:35. Both burgers were served covered in their nasty 1000 island based sauce. My son was starving, so he said he'd eat his. I sent mine back, politely. 25 minutes later, she brings back another burger that was well done, borderline burned. She asked if it was ok and I showed her that it was burnt and that I had asked for medium rare. Her response, "" Thats the kitchens mistake, there's nothing I can do about that"". I asked to speak with the manager after I paid the check and after explaining what happened, got the glazed donut stare from the 22 year old ""manager"". He says, ""well, I didn't charge you for your burger"", and just stares at me. At 8:30, we left with by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  If you ever have the urge to patronize this horrible restaurant, save your time and money and just go to McDonalds or even 7-11. The food will be the same quality but will be much cheaper and you will likely get much better customer service. If it wasn't for their cheesecake, this place would have folded years ago. Despite all the bad reviews, it still stays busy, which is why they don't even respond to all their negative feedback.

The over-the-top theme park level decor and ambiance make it seem like a concession at Disney World, and the crowds are mostly just as I described; large parties that are visiting families. The long waits at busy times and big plastic buzzers contribute to that effect. The food is competent, standard anywhere-in-America fare, but very caloric, huge portions, with large doses of butter and sugar to appeal to the mainstream. Still, it will appeal to older relatives and kids, visitors who are averse to culture shock, since this is not unlike any other in the chain, and they seem to be geared towards seating large parties.

I find it odd that the one dish on the menu that doesn't come in ginormous size is the cheesecake. I don't know if they still do it as I didn't experience it last time but it seems like they used to schedule their employees to never make it though a customers meal.  That is prior to the last time I went I don't recall making it through a meal with a single server. I always had two.  This of course causes service problems and while good for the chain (short term) is bad for the server and customer (immediately).  Long term, their scheduling system is part of what keeps me out of here.

The undeniable benefit here is that there is literally something for everyone in the menu and all the specialties I have had so far are very good. The Hibachi Steak is by far my favorite but I have yet to not enjoy my eating experience here. The service is hit or miss as with most chains and depends largely on which server you get.

Michelle H.,"Los Angeles, United States",29,51,2,2.0,27/7/2016,"Sooooo, I'm a Cheesecake Factory enthusiast!  CF is the perfect place to go when no one wants to make a decision on a particular type of food.  CF has a little of everything, and it's always very delicious.  For this visit, my family and I had just gotten into town, and this was our first meal commencing a week-long family adventure.  We hadn't taken a trip like this since we were kids.  It was something special, and we knew CF would send us off correctly.  Oh man, were we sorely mistaken.  Luckily this was the only mistake we made that week.  Ok back to the review.  Our server was Bryan, and at first he was very attentive.  He made contact with our table quickly, got our drink orders promptly (along with their famous bread), and took our order in a timely manner.  Then it all went to hell.  Our food came and tasted fine, but for NO JOKE 20 minutes, he went by our table without checking on us.  No ""two minute, two bite"" check back to see if everything came out okay.  No refills.  Not even a glance our way.  My Dad went without a drink his entire meal!  And you might ask, why didn't you raise a hand or call for him?  WE DID.  But he had a needy 5-top in the booth next to us that was taking him all over the restaurant with their requests....  I get it, I served for 8 years at a similar corporate restaurant, and it's hard to break away from a table like that, but you HAVE to BALANCE your SERVICE.  MULTITASKING is a MUST.  There is no room for going back and forth for ONE table.  Full hands in, full hands out.  That's the job.  Finally my sister got out of the booth and had to stand in front of him to stop him from walking by.  She asked for the check and boxes.  He knew he was in trouble.  He took the plates that needed to be boxed, then we got the check.  BUT HE ADDED ANOTHER TABLE'S BILL ONTO OUR CHECK.  Bryan, always glance at your check before printing.  There were no drinks on it, so the sequence of service was off.  Or perhaps you hadn't closed a previous check, which prompted the lack of drinks when you began our check.  Whatever it is, it's a messy way to work.  So we got the manager over and my sister explained what happened and he had that look.  It's the look of slight defensiveness, he's heard complaints one too many times at his restaurant.  He said he'd take 25% off and fix the ticket.  Cool, great, we just want to leave.  The manager brings back the ticket, AND IT'S FOR THE WRONG HALF OF THE BILL!  It's for a 2-top and there were four of us!  How did he not catch this?!  So then my sister hunts down the manager again.  And he doesn't say a word, just gets us the right half without eye contact and no one comes back pick up our check.  So we leave cash and were on our way.  For CF standards, I'd petition to shut this location down, you don't need this kind of negativity on your good name.  The only reason it's still open is because happy hour options (or options as a whole) are limited in Corte Madera.  Your location works in your favor.  Just...if you're reading this as a nice family going on an awesome vacation and want a place you're familiar with so you think Let's Go To CF!  Don't.  Try their local restaurants.  OH!  Or Super Duper Burgers in Mill Valley!  That place was AMAZING!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=200

I ordered the fish and chips (tempura batter fried,) with some fries, but for $14 I could have gone to the wharf and spent less for the same thing. It turned out to be the best out of all of the other five dishes we ordered.  The chicken piccata can be described as a mass of cold, old, and dried out spaghetti with a nonexistent amount of sauce. The chicken was similar to a frozen dinner entree. The fish cost $16. The meatloaf consisted entirely of bread, and the Shepherd's pie was chunks of ground beef in sauce, with mashed potatoes on top--where did the pie part go?  The food was way too overpriced and generally nasty. The bread was not good either.  Our booth was filthy, laden with old food, with a greasy table to add to the unclean sitting area.

Chris T.,"San Francisco, United States",321,53,14,2.0,16/3/2014,"This was my first trip to the Cheesecake Factory and I'm going to guess that normally this chain is reasonably good at serving food because they've been around for a while. So I don't know what happened tonight, but dinner service completely fell apart. Our table and every other table nearby was having a horrible experience. Slow meal service, missing waiters, orders coming out at inappropriate times.Our table-neighbor got her cheesecake before the main dish ever arrived.  Cheesecake Factory tries to push out kid dishes earlier, which is nice, however our other neighbors did not get the adult dishes for 20 minutes after their kid was finished eating and we got all of ours. Even getting a cup of lemonade for my son took 15 minutes and was delivered by a random person separate from our other drinks. I was going to write this all off to the kitchen or management but our waiter walked around with our check after running my credit card for at least 15 minutes. He was apologetic but it was just another thing that made dinner service Kitchen-Nightmares-worthy on this particular night. The stars it gets are because the food was pretty OK. I had the Romano Crusted Chicken and it was good (the chicken was good, but the pasta and sauce were bland). My wife's chicken pasta was pretty good as well. And I've generally heard good things about Cheesecake Factory but after spending 1h45m for a simple one-course meal, I just can't give them a favorable review this time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=220
Janice C.,"San Francisco, United States",530,2174,5892,3.0,21/1/2010,"Okay, this is weird. The bf and I had to come back to the Village at Corte Madera (an outdoor  shopping mall) because for once, he needed to purchase stuff and I'm returning goods. That almost NEVER happens. If you don't want to leave the immediate mall area, there are 3 choices for food: CF, Boudin SF and the lil cafe by Nordies. CF won. The host was suspiciously cheery for a rainy day, but I appreciated his perkiness. There was no wait which was a plus, since we were hungry. We ordered a Mojito (too sweet for our taste) to sip on while waiting for our food to come.  Normally, I gorge on the bread basket at CF, since their dark oat bread is good, but this time it was just okay and the french bread was hard. I think I cut the upper roof of my mouth from chewing on the hard edges. I ordered from the small bites menu since I wanted to try a salad and a pizza without lugging leftovers around while at the mall and the portions were just right for me.  I loved the sweet beets in my salad with goat cheese, peppery arugula and candied walnuts.  A little heavy on the dressing though. The Wild Mushroom pizzette looks like a elongated flatbread. It had plenty of cheese and the mushrooms were cooked just right.  Bf liked his Classic burger which was served with bleu cheese sauce on the side.   Our server Dominic had a cute smile and easy demeanor, but wish he was more doting on his service.

The menu is exactly the same as any other Cheesecake Factory.  If you haven't been to one yet, be prepared for menu overload and understand that portions are all huge.  This was our first time both ordering from the Skinnylicious menu.  Ignoring the silly name, this menu actually solves a big problem I have with Cheesecake Factory.  Usually the meals are way too big and I feel overfull even after just eating a portion of the meal, but this new menu does a good job of providing more balanced meal. Service was good and our server did a great job of double checking for my girlfriend's food restrictions.

We wanted to sit outside. We put our name on the list and waited. We waited and then were informed that they called our name but we didn't response and therefore they gave the table to someone else. We waited again but nothing happened. We saw several tables that were empty but needed to be cleaned.  Eventually we just went and cleaned off the table ourselves and sat down. Within seconds the host ran outside and asked us if we were sat down by someone? We said no but we were tired of waiting.  She left us there and said she will get us some menus. After another 10 minutes of waiting we got menus and some evil looks from the waitress. Then after ordering the waitress forgot our order and apologizes several times blaming the computer for it.  After about 1.5 hours of wait we got our food that wasn't even that hot anymore.  After complaining the manager offered us free cheesecake. We paid our bill and waited for the free cake that never came. We eventually left and as we passed the cheesecake station  the manager saw us and ran over to the cheesecake station to ask for our cheesecake.  She then rushed over to us to say it's being prepared. We eventually got one slice of cake. We were three people though. They could have at least given us three slices.

Empty tables all around us. Server nowhere in sight. When we were finished with our entree, the server was not around for dessert order. When we were finished with our meal, I had to stand up and look around for the server, not seeing her, I asked the manager if someone could please bring our check so we could leave.

Other restaurants in this chain are superior to this one. Additionally, they were out of soup, out of pumpkin cheesecake and this was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Server didn't recommend alternatives, just said without apology, we are ""out."" The vegeburger ordered by two at the table was literally so sloppy it would require a spoon.

The food was cooked okay, I felt as if my dish was a tad bit over cooked, but manageable as the bold flavors was there, but there was a missing element in the other dish as it lacked saltiness. I am assuming it was missing the pancetta. On to the service, Our server Michelle, was very kind and welcoming, however she lacked on checking up on our table as for her other tables. I only had one cup of water, wanted more bread, and I'm assuming her manager or someone had to pull her out of a conversation she was having with a customer at the bar for I'd say 20 mins. When we asked for to-go boxes, I surprised that this cheesecake factory had their customers box their own food. Our server Michelle was generous enough to give us two separate bags for our boxes, BUT she placed the bags directly on top of my dish.

And then one day I went with my girlfriend and I saw their ""reduced calorie"" menu--drinks and food both. 100 calorie Mojitos? I got two! Flavorful and refreshing! We split the Asian Chicken Salad (under 400 calories) along with the Miso Salmon with extra sauce (how wrong can you go with fish if you stay away from the white rice, right?!). But since we were already there and saving ourselves just thousands of calories already, we just had to order the (fried) Avocado egg rolls!  The salad was delicious and refreshing--I think it is their dressing that does the trick. The Miso Salmon with extra brown sauce was perfectly glazed and cooked just right - not over done, and not squishy. I also really enjoyed dipping the salmon in the white sauce that the rice sat on.

Salads never came until we asked for them 30 minutes later. They salads were good. 4. It was very clear that our server didn't care. She was interested in serving one of the sous chef's and his family who was sitting next to us.  5. When she gave us the bill, she just dropped it on the table and started talking to the sous chef.

That was definitely NOT the case on Thursday 1/3/13. We arrived at 9:00 and were seated immediately in the bar area. The table was dirty, the floor around the table was littered in crumbs, and the flatware had bits of dried on food. Our server took about 5 minutes to arrive at our table, and then he was neither friendly or rude, but lacked any semblance of a personality.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls and factory nachos to share. The egg rolls were tepid, and the nachos were dripping in grease, and totally lacked flavor. Our server must have known he served us lousy food, because he never checked back in, until he came to clear the plates, at which time he made a half-assed attempt to offer dessert, as he dropped the check and ran away.

Two of them asked for their left overs to be boxed. One was boxed and the server confessed she'd ""tossed"" the other and took that dinner off the check.

Well, I just came here with some lady friends and was so disappointed with how small my portion was that I had to complain about it. Luckily the management was great and understood that clearly there was a mistake, but it was such a shame to have to go through all of that when whoever brought the dish to the table should have noticed how small it was or even my waiter didn't notice. The flavors were right on but talk about doing portion control... Still had a nice time, our waiter was lovely and the dessert was superb as usual. I guess my message is, if you are presented with a dish that looks like you could actually finish it, something isn't right and cheesecake if you have decided to drastically cut down on your portions, like half the amount, then please let us as customers know or lower the price of the dish.

The reason to come here, though, is to get dessert.  Even if you are too stuffed from the rest of your meal, you need to get a slice of cheesecake, at least to go.  We ordered 5 different slices and shared them, and they were all excellent.

First thing I love about this place is that they give you a basket of free bread. Since we both liked the brown oat bread, the server gave us just only that. I ordered a half sandwich/soup/salad combo, and I had expected a small plate, but what was supposed to be ""half"" of a chicken salad sandwich, it was big enough to be a whole sandwich! I also paired it with a spicy chicken tortilla soup and a huge portion of their infamous ceasar salad...ALL for under $10! So we were sooo stuffed from our overly portioned lunch plates that we forgot all about ordering drinks for happy hour! The service was an added bonus to our meal as well. Don't be surprised if I'm a regular at this location and the San Francisco Macy's location (I just hate the long wait for that one).  And what was our original purpose for vising this place?

Unfortunately for the last 3 months or so we've found it nearly impossible to place our order.  I start trying to place the order once we exit the Waldo tunnel and I am ALWAYS put on hold.  I've tried holding until we get to CF.  I've tried hanging up, redialing, and complaining to the receptionist who answers that NO, I do not want to be put on hold.  Finally, last Tuesday (8-21-12), I walked into CF still on hold and asked for ""the manager""  A young lady who said she was ""the manager"" apologized profusely and said they'd been really busy...yet there was only one order sitting there and no other cars outside in the pick-up area. She explained that it's just her (running between the kitchen and the counter/car) and the server behind the counter.  Only they (or her?) can take the orders because there are more than 200 items and the receptionist's aren't capable of asking the right questions.  Since the restaurant wasn't busy I asked why the servers couldn't help out when they were busy and that they shouldn't leave customers on hold for so long.   Prior to 2-3 months ago we were only rarely put on hold and only for a minute or two.  I haven't been able to successfully place an order by phone since then. Since it only takes 15 minutes or so to prepare the order (yeah!!) placing the order earlier doesn't work.  IF I have to walk inside to order...what is the purpose of your pick-up area?  Why is the receptionist answering the phone for Take-out if all she is going to do is put me on hold?  What process ensures that somebody eventually takes the held calls?  The few times I've managed to place the order before arriving was when I hung up and dialed until the person answering was different and took the order directly.  I've also sat on hold for 15 minutes only to have my calls dropped.  I want Take-Out fixed!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=320

Not really sure why there's so many reviews here that say nothing negative about CF and still give only three stars.  Upset that it's a chain?  Meh, get over it.  To me, there's nothing inherently bad about a chain.  I've been to plenty of one-off restaurants that suck.  Also I read some people complained about the caloric content of this place.  Have you actually looked at the nutritional information in most restaurants?  Terrifying.  At least this place's ""healthy salads"" were under 590 calories, not around 700 like other places...

Funny enough, I called my friend to see how he was doing and he told me he had gotten off phone with the manager 20 minutes before I called reporting that the artichoke dip made him sick. Hmmm, not cool management. As bad as it may seem to admit your food made us sick, you should have the morality of advising us that others reported food poisoning, and that medical attention was needed in the other incidents ( my buddies fiancé was one of the 2 people in the e.r), he made sure the management was aware.

Half the table ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad (yum), someone ordered the fresh spring rolls as an entree which worked out well, another ordered the fish tacos which are always a standout.

For some reason I always seem to think that the service ""isn't that bad"" and today, again, I was reminded of just how wrong I can be.  NOTE:: The food is great, this review has nothing to do with the food, which is probably why I keep suffering through a meal here, because I so enjoy the vast menu of yumminess.  Don't tell anyone but I'm pretty sure our server was an auto-bot of some sort because his voice never changed tone and I'm pretty sure I didn't see any facial expressions. And someone forgot to program the ""check on your tables after they get their food"" setting because after we got our food he didn't come check on us until we were actually done eating.  In our desperate attempt to quench our thirst we had to ask a food runner for a refill but he said ""your server (aka auto-bot) will help you,"" in the end, another lovely server who obviously knows what she was doing (wish she had been MY server) got our refills.  In addition we were sat without the following: silverware, salt, pepper, condiments and bread, although I realize the bread comes after the fact.  Again, food good, service, really, really poor. I would recommend eating at the bar where the bartenders have no way of getting away from you.  And don't forget to try the Strawberry Lemonade which is heaven in a glass and of course, the cheesecake is straight up a slice of heaven!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=360
Marie K.,"Larkspur, United States",12,72,2,3.0,6/6/2010,"Chain restaurants are never my first choice, but the Cheescake Factory is decent enough for one.  It is a good place for a quick lunch while out shopping with the girls, or to meet some pals for a Happy Hour.  The appetizers are good to share with friends over drinks- and one of my fave sandwiches is the Shrimp Club.  Yum. Kid friendly?  Eh- debatable.  They have a kids menu, ok.  But restaurants that classify themselves as ""Kid Friendly"" should at least offer some crayons and something to doodle on.  The best kid friendly restaurants all do!  I know, all my friends without kids give me the ""You should come prepared and bring that stuff with you"".  Well, maybe- but once you have kids you truly appreciate the places that try to make taking your kids out just a little easier- and those places get more of my $$$, for sure.   All in all, good place for lunch or dinner with older kids and adults- but if you're looking for a familiy night out with young kids-- go over to Max's across the freeway.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=360
Betty S.,"San Francisco, United States",79,281,2,3.0,26/4/2009,"Came here last night for dinner and we left very full and happy people. Normally I would avoid the Cheesecake Factory like the plague - but I took my chances and hope that we didn't have to wait 2 hrs for a table. We got there at 9pm - rather late for dinner and we only had to wait 5-10 mins max. Perfect! We were seated quickly and the waiter took our order. I like how they they give you fresh rye and sourdough bread with butter to munch on while you wait for your food.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls - one of my favorite appetizers here. It was really delicious but the dipping sauce was a little sweet. We also ordered the Cuban sandwich and substituted the fries for a side of mac and cheese. The sandwich was actually really good - not oily and with a unique taste. The mac and cheese was delicious - made with white cheddar and was creamy and not too cheesy. I could have just had a side of that for dinner. The strawberry lemonade was good - but way too sweet.  Overall our experience here was good. We didn't have to wait the normal 1-2 hrs for a seat, and the service here was actually very attentive. Portions here are huge so I suggest sharing if you can. We didn't even order a lot, and we took half a sandwich home. The cheesecake looked really good and there was a great selection but we were really full.

The thing I however hate most about Cheesecake is the ridiculously long wait to get seated.  If you're already hungry and you try to go to the Union Square, Palo Alto or Valley Fair locations, forget about being seated before you pass out from hypoglycemia. Because of the typically insane waitlist on any given night, I have avoided Cheesecake altogether for quite some time.  My explorations of the Bay recently led me to The Village at Corte Madera (sounds like some sequel from M. Night Shyamalan).  Situated right next to Nordstrom sits a Cheesecake Factory that I had no idea existed.  Feeling famished from a long day, we stopped by.  While we were already prepared to be turned away by the host telling us that there was an hour+ wait...we were actually shocked when he said we would be seated in 10-15 min.  And as promised, our little restaurant pager lit up within 15 min.  We were set up with a nice table out on the patio right under a heat lamp.  Waitress was very pleasant and provided us with really good service.  We ordered the appetizer sampler of course...avocado eggrolls were so excellente after working up an appetite from explorin' the Marin Headlands.  For dessert, I have never really enjoyed any of their actual cheesecakes...so this time I sampled the Chocolate Truffle Cake.  If you like chocolate...get this cake...period. So if you're ever tired of fighting to hit all the foodie hotspots and you simply want some huge portions of fatty American food...this Cheesecake location will hit the spot...without the wait!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=360
Sami R.,"San Francisco, United States",8,170,,3.0,5/7/2010,"Chain restaurants tend to have it tough when it comes to Yelp reviews, as the bar seems to be set at a higher mark for them simply because of that. We have been to plenty of four star Yelp rated restaurants, which ended up being lackluster, while we have been to several chain restaurants with low ratings that ended up being fairly good. Chevy's is one, Cheesecake Factory is another. This place isn't fantastic, but our experience here was overall good. We ordered the Caesar Salad and the Basil Chicken pasta. The portions here are huge, with both being more than enough to keep us full with enough left overs for an entire second meal at a later occasion as well. The service was also more or less good, as the waitress kept our bread full before the food arrived. However, there was a huge delay in terms of the process of getting our check.  Pasta was good though, salad was good. Neither was top of the line, and we have had better elsewhere, but each was still tasty in its own right and something we were glad we ordered in the end. We did end up asking for some extra Caesar dressing, though, as it was lacking a little in that department, and the waitress was happy to bring us another container. Overall, this place was good. We are kind of conflicted between 3 and 4 stars. There are aspects of it that seem to apply to both just being ""okay"" and being ""very good"". Suffice to say, though, that we will be going back to a Cheesecake Factory in the future, this location or another, when we feel like pigging out on some huge portions.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=360

Unfamiliar with the culinary offerings in Corte Madera, we settled on Cheesecake Factory. ""For reals?"" I questioned hubby. ""For real!"" he replied. So in we went...and was told to wait around 30 minutes. 30 more minutes to try different chairs, stare at the table, imagine it in our dining room. Restoration Hardware is such a temptress...ahem...and a story, err review for another time. As for Cheesecake Factory, I had forgotten how extensive a menu it has! Seems like there's definitely Asian and Italian leanings. Although I went with my safe choice-- neither here nor there-- a yummy jambalaya. Hubby had a tougher time deciding between two dishes: steak and steak. Okay, to be more precise, it was a fight between ribeye and Hibachi. Now, I thought Hibachi was an old TV brand or some kind of crappy outdoor grill, but never knew it could describe a steak. And from hubby's expression (quite the self-proclaimed steak connoisseur by the way) he was pleasantly surprised! Tangy, sweet but not too sweet, smoky, tender wonderful steak!! Almost as good as my jambalaya. And it was accompanied by a large yummy mound of garlic mashed potatoes. Yum! So all in all, not too bad for a chain. And a very good meal.

The food is amazing and the cheesecakes are little pieces of heaven. Also, the menu provides a huge variety of food from pastas, steaks to sandwiches to fit anybody's taste buds.  I'll be reviewing the service and how kid friendly it was. I made a huge mistake by not finding out what my server's name was but all i know is that she was AMAZING! She had long curly brownish hair and was probably in her early twenties. She made sure that we had bread on the table, drinks were filled and even gave us the status of our order since it took a little longer. Its amazing how wonderful a dining experience can be when you have a server who's attentive & friendly. She was great.  My little girl is at that age where she hates sitting still... oh and lucky us, she HATES high chairs. I asked for some crayons and paper but  was told they didn't have any. I mean, really? You have a kids menu but no crayons or paper? We weren't expecting to eat out but now I know that if we ever go to a cheesecake factory again, we'd have to bring our  own supplies. Which is fine but slightly disappointing.  Also, the touch faucet in the bathroom is so irritating. I was holding my daughter and every time I would touch the faucet & put her hands under there, it stopped. It was such a hassle to just wash her hands that I ended up with a wet t-shirt when I came out.

We waited and waited still no waitress (waited at least 15 minutes) other parties were being served who came in after us and before us still no waitress. I through my hands up and  I finally walked back over to the bar area and ordered my drinks and walked back over to my seat. Out of nowhere she appears with a frown on her face... Asking if we needed anything else as she brought out our plates and if we still wanted the drinks that we had ordered from the begining? I told her no that we were fine and off she went upset mumbling under her breath.  I wasn't phased at all, you can miss me with all that! We both had the Steak Diane and I give that dish five stars hands down, it was good. A large portion of red mashed potatoes and a steak well seasoned and cook to perfection.

I appreciate their smiling staff. Their food took a bit of a dip in cooking technique in 2008, but they seem to have bounced back since then.  I appreciate their decor and ambiance. It reminds me of the old HUGE movie palaces back East where they have Egyptian styled lobbies. Chandeliers, pillars, mirrors, etc. these old movie houses have been turned into restaurants back home on the East coast, so I understand the decor that Cheesecake is going for. The decor is over the top and that suits us just fine. The whole vibe goes along with the Village Mall experience of shopping energy and big multiple visuals.  Love the smiley guy host at the front door with the long blonde hair. When he's not there, our dining experience is not complete. Love the Ahi Carpaccio, Roasted Lemon Chicken, Meatloaf, Pork Chops, with Mashed Potatoes, Carrots, Pecan Crusted Catfish, Tiramisu and Lemoncello Cake.

Yes, a lot of the food is probably pre-packaged/frozen. But thankfully I've never lived within an hour of Cheesecake Factory so going is a rare treat for me! It's not the type of place that I would wait to be seated at. If I'm going to wait, I'm going to seek out the best of the best, but I look forward to going here once every few months for the atmosphere, good service, and yummy cocktails,. I went with my bf yesterday before the Giants game and sat in the self-seating cocktail area at one of the hightops. Service was really friendly, charming and funny. I ordered the Blueberry Mojito which was delicious, although I'd order it with an added shot next time. Next I tried the Asian Pear Martini! This was a stronger drink, but had a somewhat syrupy texture I didn't love. It was also quite sweet. My bf had a spiked banana milkshake, yum! Because I like drinking there and I already know that the drinks have half a day's worth calories in them, I usually order off the skinnylicious (stupid name!) menu, and so far there's nothing on it that I wouldn't recommend. The bleu cheese and pear flatbread was chewy and flavorful, but I recommend eating it while it's hot! It was super soggy for breakfast this morning. I also tried the fried mac and cheese balls (no, not on the skinnylicious menu)! Omg, I could barely finish one. Sooo rich, but very yummy! The beet salad was very good too. I don't like the bread there, it usually tastes stale and too crusty to me, but I suppose that's for the better! As usual, there was no room for cheesecake!

My server, who looked a lot like Adrian Grenier (drooooooooool~), greeted me quickly and took my order. New Zealand sauvignon blanc please. And he asked for my ID! yay!!  For lunch I went with the small green salad with bacon vinaigrette. The salad was whatever. And if the salad dressing was in fact bacon vinaigrette, I couldn't tell. Didn't taste any bacon. Any oil. Any vinegar. I just tasted freshly washed salad mix. Hmmm...  For the main entree, I went for the LUNCH PORTION romano chicken. I emphasize LUNCH PORTION because when a menu says ""lunch portion"" you would think it would be a small portion right? Well, I sure think that way. So it comes out and it's HUGE. 1 very large flattened chicken breast and what looked to be almost an entire box of spaghetti with sauce. Come on people!! You don't need THAT MUCH FOOD for lunch!!!!  I don't like to complain, but hear me out for a second. I don't know where the portions got so out of hand. Americans want more and more and bigger and bigger.

Do not get a salad or anything fried. Salads don't keep once they are dressed and fried foods go soggy. Last night I the chicken Diana (I think that was it). Two generous pieces of boneless chicken, lightly breaded and sauteed with a cream sauce. It came with about a pound of mashed potatoes, no joke, and 2 cups of steamed broccoli. Enough for two normal adults even without an appetizer. I had a glass of Mark West Pinot. My son had a chicken quesadilla (he ate half) and my daughter had the child's corn dogs.

Matt R.,"San Rafael, United States",3,172,,2.0,7/11/2011,"We ate here mid-shift on Sunday afternoon October 30. I mention mid-shift because it appeared the kitchen was indifferent and did not care if the items cooked matched what had been ordered. The combination cream of chicken artichoke soup was excellent. I had bits of bell peppers, corn, and mushrooms  (it took a very long time to get to the table and we looked out and saw people outside who had arrived after us served before us). We ordered a grilled artichoke, which came out boiled, not grilled, and with a very bland sauce. We asked the manager (see below) when she asked about the hamburger, how the artichoke was supposed to be cooked, and she answered grilled meant it had grill marks. This artichoke had none. The manager said it was not cooked the way it was supposed to be. A Kobe (American) hamburger ordered medium rare came out burned well, and had to be sent back. Once it returned (now more rare than medium rare) it was very good. The chicken salad sandwich appeared to be how bland can you go? The sandwich, which claims to be on brioche toast, came out with toasted white bread . The chicken salad, stated to have almonds, did have some almonds -- about two slivers (sprinkled on by the chef before serving?  Tranced out?), and had no seasoning. I didn't think mayonnaise was a seasoning, but perhaps I am wrong. The chicken tasted as though it was not fresh. Service (referring to the servers not the kitchen staff) was excellent. The manager, when she heard the hamburger had to be sent back, apologized and comped the hamburger and the artichoke. Others have noted that the service persons do not always match who takes your order. Our experience was not different, but I think the servers  tried hard.  The food here, as others have noted, can vary.

YOU HAVE A FAN UP HERE!) But I digress (visions of chili cheese fries... mmmmmm...) The Cheesecake Factory was a treat back then, but after the last few times I've been there, it's become less of a treat and more of a place where I eat too much Chili's style food. You will not be disappointed if all you are expecting is an OK, somewhat fancy-schmancy sandwich. I suggest getting half a salad at lunchtime, or sharing one, and then getting the cheesecake (but don't get the banana- too fakey tasting.) Speaking of the cheesecake, how many of you have not thought about laying down under the whipped cream machine with your mouth wide open??? Mmmmm... whipped cream... But I digress (geez, I'm distracted tonight.)

Since I have never tried the cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory I ordered a piece of the Original with the Strawberry glaze to take with me as well. I have to say that when I did finally try it, I kind of didn't like it so much. It tasted salty to me. I think maybe it was the sour cream layer that grossed me out.  Whatever it was, I didn't care for it and threw most of the cake out. Obviously, lots of people love the cheesecake so it must just be me. I had the same experience with that movie the Professional. Most people love that movie, but I hate that it, and imagine now that my personal hell might be where it plays on a loop while Marin mothers serve me Cheesecake Factory cheesecake from atop of their double-wide baby strollers.

I don't really think that's BAD...it's just something to be aware of. I hardly ever even make it to desert. It's a chain, which I don't like, and there are ads in the menu (eeeew) which adds to the overall tackiness already put in place by the bizarre decorum (pastel roman impressionist mother's day card trying to be romantic...?) But, well... The actual FOOD is quite good. Their meat is cooked right, and the flavors are usually well-rounded (if a twinge, eh, fatty).  They also have a very, very large menu, which I love. There's something here for everyone. I hate restaurants that offer 6 entrees on their menu. Not here, my friends. For this, It's a great place to go with a group.  I think the prices are very, very fair. You can get a sandwich that will last you through tonight and tomorrow's lunch for 10 dollars.  It's also one of the ONLY places in Marin county that's open past 10. Did you hear that?  at 11 o'clock on a Friday, it's this or Dennys. Don't put it out of your mind as a late night spot to get chow that won't give you acid reflux, constipation and nightmares. I think people need to ease up on this place. Also, a note on their meat: Their chicken is natural and free range. No hormones or antibiotics. Yea, ask your favorite diner if their chickens were treated better then most--and whether or not by eating that chicken sandwich you will be consuming the hormones, anitbiotics and preservatives that were added to the meat before and after it was killed. Their beef, I'm not so sure about. It' s all USDA grade A (some of it even Kobe)...which, I guess means happier, healthier cows, for a happier, healthier you, but all meat companies ever talk about is the marbling...not whether nasty hormones/checmicals were added.

My first complaint about a place who is famous for its cheesecake charged us $6.50 for a sliver of cheesecake! The portions were rediculously huge and not very exciting. Our salad was majorly wilted and we felt rushed. This was a huge disappointment. They really need to get negative ratings for this website because some of these restaurants are really bad.

Mike M.,"Richmond, United States",16,93,4,3.0,17/6/2008,"In general, my experience at this cheesecake factory was okay.  The food was pretty much the same as any other cheesecake factory but it took forever to be seated.  The hostess originally said that it would be a 25 to 35 minute wait.  45 minutes later we were seated.  Not such a big deal except that there was nowhere to sit and the bar was full.  On top of that, the pagers apparently don't work outside.  We ended up getting seated in a booth below an air conditioner vent.  The entire time we were there we had a constant chilly breeze.  At some point they dimmed the lights way too low making our booth feel like a cave.   When it came to service I'm not sure if the waiter annoyed the hell out of me or impressed me.  We definitely got outstanding attention from him but I can't help but wonder if some of his sharp humor and witty comments were really just a lame way of trying to hit on my fiance.  He must of asked her ten times if she wanted to order cheesecake and even hunched down at our table and started bullshitting.  Although it was nothing too obvious, it started to get real annoying.

Valerie C.,"San Francisco, United States",213,137,43,2.0,16/5/2008,"As I sit here picking at the remnants of a Cheesecake Factory Chicken Madeira, I have to say that this is one of those few occasions where the food tastes better a day later. I mean, you know how food quality is supposed to be sub-par when served as leftovers? Well in my case, the mediocre food I had last night is still mediocre today. And since I anticipated a change (for the worse) in taste and instead was greeted by the same oversalted mashed potatoes and overdone cheese I had at my bff's graduation dinner last night, by default my expectations were exceeded. But enough with my attempt at being philosophical about the Cheesecake Factory; bottom line is: I DON'T SEE MYSELF EVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN. I didn't even want to waste my time yelping about a chain, but a'las the experience I had last night had to be one of the worst I've had for this restaurant chain (I've been ones in Palo Alto, San Francisco, Sacramento and Waikiki).  I come here out of comfort: I LOVE the calamari and the bread service is pretty good (although I usually skip the sourdough and go straight for the brown loaf), and if I didn't manage to stuff myself with the above PLUS an entre, I definitely go for a slice of cheesecake. Last night was no different.  Our party of eight was seated on the patio, which we surprisingly did not have to wait long for. (The weather was GORGEOUS!) However, it was obvious the service would be slow from that point forward as our server had to have had half the tables (something like 8-10 parties).  We started off with appetizers (calamari and the spinach dip) which took longer than it should have to come out. I KNOW both could have been served better, as the calamari came out as one solid battered mess and the spinach dip required you to crack through the heatlamp-dried top to reach what should have been the creamy dip. The bread came out sometime after that, and then the food, which I mentioned earlier. We decided for some cheesecake (after all, it's not made onsite anyway) so we weren't really disappointed with that. The best part of my experience had to be my company.

The entrees were fine but the appetizers have been so disappointing that we just don't bother any more.

The food was nice (and the portions huge - not our portions, but all the burger and fries and meal-sized salads we saw around us).   I've only been to Cheesecake Factory once in my life before this, and that was in Seattle many moons ago.  I remember the pasta was cheesy and the cheesecake addicting.  So when my husband and I were here over the weekend shopping, instead of buying a sandwich at Boudin SF, I said let's try Cheesecake Factory, since he had only been to CF once his life also. I wanted pasta and dessert.  He wanted the Cubano sandwich.  We also got a menu listing all the calories of every dish they served.  It had everything on it, every appy, every lunch special, every drink.  We were in shock.  My husband was in so much shock I had to tell him to keep his voice down.  Even with his running and weight conditioning everyday, he could not justify the roughly 1600 calories (give or take a couple hundred cals) on one Cubano sandwich.  The pasta dishes I wanted were creamy sauces.  Even at the smaller lunch portion, they were around 1200 calories.  The tomato-based sauces were 1000 calories.   So what did we get?  He had an egg-white omelette, I had the simply grilled salmon with vegies.  Each was 900 cals or under.  It was just a piece of salmon, no sauce.  But it was a good size, and pretty flavorful even without any sauces.  It came with a nice side salad with vinaigrette dressing.   To start off they served really gooood bread!  I ate maybe 600 cals worth of bread just there alone. This was our first time dining out and were able to look at the calories of our meals.  I don't know if I like it or not!  It didn't make for an enjoyable lunch.  I guess after time, we will get used to it and learn to look past the calories.  If you substitute for lighter sides, the numbers go down.   I'm going to give a shout out to our server, Ashleigh.  She was fantastic.  She spoke so clearly, slowly, and gently.  She was so professional, too.  I think she was 21 or so, but her attitude was so mature and just - nice!  I really enjoyed hearing her speak.

It was evident to me that she and her team really seem to have this gig under control as I witnessed patrons at two other tables give them a hard time over what seemed like ""high maintenance hell"" (ex: ""I like my Arnold Palmer with just little bit more lemonade than iced tea, can you redo this?"" - are you kidding me?).  But this staff seemed to handle it all really nicely even if my eyes were rolling back into my head.  Good job Cheesecake Factory.  Give the girl a raise!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=420
Ryan G.,"San Francisco, United States",10,154,,3.0,11/12/2007,"Size MATTERS. Especially here in some obscene manner, anything you order will come in large portions. Large enough that if two of you are not super hungry, can probably split one meal and still have ROOM for cheesecake.  Cheescake Factory is in the Village, in Corte Madera. One of only a few food options when shopping here, they did away with the mall-like food court, in order to enhance the quality of this PLACE. While you can expect a wait during most busy times: sunny shopping days, weekend nights and during the HOLIDAYS. Wait is not to bad, and they give you one of those remote, vibrating disc things that alerts you that your wait is over.  Really need to work on the range of these. Confined to sitting within a few yards of the front door. Tried to put it to the test by sitting near Nordstrom's, bad CHOICE. Moving along... Seating is plentiful, the booths can feel a little packed when there are 4 adults and expanding waist lines. If you are impatient on waiting, snag one of the table tops or bar space and order off the full menu. Once seated you are greeted with the most insanely packed menu. 8+ pages with colored ADVERTISEMENTS for plastic surgery (oddly enough!) to vacations. First few pages are alcohol. Make a decision and move onto the food.  My strategy here is to rule out whole categories of food, like say pasta or salad. And then try and choose. My safe pick was fish tacos. Nice to get a choice Albacore or Mahi Mahi. Along came my plate full of 3 fat tacos. Finished ONE and hit a wall.  All the burgers looked decent enough, and the Crispy Cajun Littles (chicken fingers!) was insane. Fried pieces everywhere, huge lump of mashed potatoes. Guess you can be good and substitute for some broccoli, smothered in BUTTER. A coronary awaits you here! If you were able to finish your meal. Cheesecake awaits you here. Place is good just for that, skip food and just eat cake next time. Choices are again, INSANE. Chocolate, peanut butter, snickers, banana, pumpkin, and more in all sorts of combinations.

I have tried numerous appetizers, salads, small plates, pastas, pizzas, sandwiches, cocktails and cheesecakes over the years and Its always been sort of the same thing. My opinion on this establishment fluctuates all the time I either hate it or I love it dearly. What I don't like about this restaurant is that it is busy most of the time and they always seems to sit you somewhere that isn't very comfortable. I disapprove of a restaurant that dares calls themselves the ""Cheesecake Factory"" and doesn't make their own cheesecakes. I found out that they are shipped there every morning and all that is actually made there is the food itself. Now over time I have had really great waiters and really bad ones some are absolutely on their game and ready to assist you. Some have seemed disinterested in what they do or have creeped me out a little. There portions are huge and basically you will want to split some of their items with a friend or date, I could not even imagine eating it all by myself. Now what I do like is that the cheesecakes are good, filling but good. I always love there bread that they bring out right when you get there, its so damn good. I like there new introductions to a Tapas menu so you can eat here now without spending an arm and leg and they are small so you don't leave feeling like a fat cow.

The first day it opened we had 20 or more EX-CCF employees picketing our front doors. I should have taken the hint then and left.  The food here is terrible for the price For one the portions are HUGE. That is something that this place takes pride in. But I think its unhealthy. It just encourages people to eat appetizers the size of two meals. Then the meals themselves are so huge it would feed my whole family. Beyond that the food is extremely fatty, e.g. Fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls ... Despite how hard I worked and all the heavy lifting I did, when I was gone, I had gained a ton of weight and 6 months later I had lost 40 lbs by just not eating there anymore.   Beyond that the food itself is just mediocre. I don't know why anyone would pay $20 for something that I could make at home from a box in a fraction of the time it takes to go there, wait for a table and then wait for the food. Its really not worth it.  Another point is a good portion of the food is taken from other restaurants, they even admit it, they have us sing the burger king song to remember the ingrediants on one of their burgers. They have $6 burger type things from Carl's Jr. except a little bit taller and they charge $15. Even working there and getting a 50% discount on the food the only thing I could really afford was a burger or pizza or an appetizer on what they paid me. Trust me, the food is crap for what you are paying for it.  The service is terrible, and you know why? they can't keep anyone there longer than a few months. I was only there 6 or 7 months and I still outlasted several of their managers. No one that I started with is still there, not even the manager who hired me.

Sammy S.,"Oakland, United States",366,281,22,3.0,6/11/2006,"I'm not really a big fan of the cheesecake factory. The portions of food are absolutely ridiculous. Like there is this Asian salad that has crunchies piled on top, that is seriously as tall as the leaning tower of Pisa. Who really needs that much food I ask? (and believe me, I love huge portions, but this is unreal). And do you notice who is eating at the Cheesecake factory? Mommies who take their little kids here during a day of shopping. These poor kids are being breed to think like fat kids. After enough visits to the cheesecake factory they will begin to think ""hey, this is a normal sized meal,"" then they'll start complaining about the too-small portions you serve them at home.   I'm also freaked out by the all-white attire worn by the staff. White is the most impractical color to wear in a restaurant. It's just a recipe for a big, ugly disaster that there is no way to cover up. The ambiance is totally tacky and over the top. It looks like a restaurant in a Vegas hotel, with all the cheesy murals and chandeliers.   I actually think the food is not bad and I come here for lunch once in a while if I'm in the hood, and by in the hood, I mean shamelessly shopping at the yuppiest outdoor ""shopping center"" aka mall in town. So the lunch food is ok, but the cheesecakes here are fucking great. I try to get ones that aren't too complex, because if you add too much to you're cheesecake, it basically becomes something else. But I'm a huge fan of the banana cream cheesecake. Out of this world I tell you. Just like Evie!  Side bar that indicates I may start eating like the fat kids at the Cheesecake factory:  Last week we celebrated my father's birthday, which happens to fall on Halloween. So not only had I already eaten more candy in one night than an entire year (I'm usually not that into candy), but my mom had picked up a traditional old fashion cheesecake. I only ate a tiny slice, but this weekend, while my parents were out of town, I decided to eat one of the left over pieces. As I started to dig in, I began eying the left over Halloween candy, picturing how amazing it would be if I crumbled bits of Twix on top of the cheesecake. I mean, the Cheesecake factory would do it, actually I think they do, but with Snickers. I walked back and forth to the bucket of candy three or four times before I decided it would be way too disgusting to do what I was daydreaming about. See, just ordering food from the restaurant take-out style leaves me with fat kid mentality. I think I need a break from the factory.

It was our initial server who disappointed me. The wait was to be expected considering it was lunchtime on a Sunday and the hostesses were doing their job efficiently without being rude.  We were seated in a booth and our 1st server was soon there to take our drink orders. He came to put the napkins down for the drinks but instead of placing them down, HE LEISURELY TOSSED THEM ON THE TABLE. WTF kind of service was that? I asked for water with lemon, he brought me water no straw no lemon. So I then had to ask for my lemon. Our bread came awhile later, isn't that the first thing to hit the table even before the drinks come? The food was as expected, good! Our server was NOT on top of filling drinks either. The mister's soda was finished for quite a bit and the server was no where to be seen or found. We had to put the cup on the edge of the table for someone to notice and when he finally came out he took the cup, but never returned the refill so we had to ask him for that. Luckily for us, he was off to his break so another guy stepped in and his attentiveness was far better.

Amber C.,"Burlingame, United States",94,23,,2.0,14/4/2014,"This is the first (and possibly last) time I have visited this Cheesecake Factory. I'm more familiar with the SF location, and have always had a great experience there. Our names were taken, and after a short wait my friend and I were seated. Our waitress was friendly, and checked in with us (we took a bit of time to get settled and figure out what we want).  When the waitress returned, my friend ordered the Asian Pear Martini, and I a glass of white wine. I ordered the entree Pear and Endive salad, while my friend said she'd like to start with an appetizer salad. Imagine my surprise when my ""entree salad"" came back on a tiny plate. After poking around a bit at my salad, I didn't find any fo the grilled chicken, pear or blue cheese I had expected. My friend discovered there is also an ""Endive Salad"" on the appetizer menu, and, after conferring with the waitress, we discovered there had been a slight mixup. She had thought I wanted the appetizer Endive, not the entree Pear and Endive. An honest mistake, which she readily fixed. The Endive salad was whisked away, and after a bit my Pear and Endive salad was brought out. Here was why I gave this location two stars. The salad was extremely disappointing!!! Let me explain. I'm not a super picky food eater. Something has to be extremely awful or bland for me to dislike it. In general, I love food. But this salad was terribly bland. I could have made a better version at home for half the price. My friend and I soon discovered that the ratios of the meal were completely off. I basically received a bowl of greens with grilled chicken. The salad has almost no dressing on it. I discovered three (three!) TINY hunks of blue cheese at the bottom of my dish, and almost no walnuts. There was also almost no pear. Essentially, I ate through the slightly dry greens, and ended up enjoying about 3 bites worth of properly proportioned greens-extras mix at the bottom of my dish.  This was a huge disappointment. We all go out for dinner expecting a treat, but I ended up enjoying the complimentary bread more than the salad I ordered. I think with the proper mix of ingredients, the taste would be a hit. But this salad was an absolute no go. My friend enjoyed her appetizer salad and salmon though, so I am thrilled she picked something that was done right. She did not like her martini though, because it was very sweet, almost like syrup. The bottom of the martini had a gritty texture from the pear puree. The two stars I give: one for the waitress who was friendly and very attentive. The second: the cheesecake.  The saving grace of this meal was the cheesecake. Our waitress recommended the smores cheesecake, and my friend and I split it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Holy moly. They even top it with their house-made marshmallow fluff. It truly saved the day. I am still very much on the fence about whether to return to the Cheesecake Factory in Corte Madera again. The location was perfect to meet halfway with my friend for our once-a-month dinner, but my experience was less than thrilling.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-corte-madera?start=300

Christian H.,"San Rafael, United States",145,233,408,2.0,22/3/2009,"Let's take a moment to discuss the topic of Ketchup Cleanliness.   Corporate restaurants like this Cheesecake Factory have a condiment policy that items like ketchup always come to the table with a full bottle.  How would they do that without bringing each and every table a brand new bottle?  They DON'T.  What they do instead is have their servers marry the glass ketchup bottles so that they are ""presented full"" to each table they go to.   What's wrong with that, you ask?  First, you will notice that Heinz Ketchup  clearly tells you not to do that on the labels of their bottles.  Second, the color of the ketchup will change over time, turning more of a dark brown color.  Third, think about all the possible bacterial transfers that could happen by recycling the ketchup from table to table.  Fourth, over time...old ketchup will begin a gassy fermentation which can be noticed if you look closely and see bubbles forming in it. What happens with all that gassy fermentation, you ask?  If you were sitting at the bar last Thursday for lunch, you got the answer RIGHT IN YOUR FACE while you had lunch!  One guy opened a gassy, bacteria-infested ketchup bottle to use for his burger and the entire contents VOLCANOED out of the bottle onto everyone in a ten foot radius! Come on, Cheesecake Factory.  This problem was so five-years ago in the restaurant industry.  Order the smaller, squeezable ketchup bottles that you can't take the cap off of to marry, transfer bacteria or shower all of your customers with while they are just trying to enjoy lunch!
