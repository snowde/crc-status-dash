Foodie K.,"Irvington, NY",13,231,2256,5.0,8/21/2017,Six of us getting together after a year. We always love everything here and we had a great server this afternoon (also posted it on tips) ALISON R.  Posted pix of food and us. She was kind enough to give us couples separate checks.

Laurie K.,"Red Hook, NY",15,51,5,1.0,12/9/2017,DONT GO. FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE. MR.Romance and I stopped in for lunch spent way over $50.00 and didn't even get the Cheesecake. No entrance into the mall. Bathrooms were filthy. NEVER AGAIN.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2
P M.,"Danbury, CT",1,23,,1.0,12/20/2017,"First off the bathrooms were disgusting, need to be cleaned desperately. Rhianon S. is a subpar waitress at best. After I told her that the chicken in my caesar salad was raw she got the manager Mike. Mike came and gave a comment by saying that the chicken was not raw but instead it was a ligament in the chicken that I had pointed out.

Nancy L.,"Danbury, CT",0,21,66,3.0,8/14/2017,"The food was good. Had a chicken picatta, but nothing special. Hubby had a chicken burrito (?). Looked pretty, but again just ok. Drinks was another story. I was disappointed with their mojito. First I asked for happy hour drinks (we were there before 5pm) and was told only at the bar. Ok, so i went ahead and ordered the mojito. Found it to be mostly ice and very little liquid. But the kicker is that it cost $12!! As much as my entree! Well, I've now learned to make my own mojitos, with not so much ice and better tasting. Thanks  Cheesecake factory.  Oh, 3 stars because your cheese cakes are really sooo good. Drinks, not at all.

Lisa B.,"Norwalk, CT",81,290,132,4.0,3/6/2017,"I came to the Cheese Cake factory with my Dad last week because we were hungry and decided to give it a try. It is conveniently located in the mall which is awesome! Tons of parking, and a great place to walk off your meal afterwards ! The ccf was a lot fancier inside than i expected! (Considering the only other time I had seen the inside of one before was on The big band theory lol). If i had to describe how it looked it kind of reminds me of an amped up version of a California Pizza Kitchen. The food was pretty good, we both ordered off their skinny menu which is a great option considering some of their meals can add up to almost 2000 calories in one meal! We had chicken pasta and stuffed mushrooms. They also bring out fresh bread with lunch which is great, fewer and fewer places are doing that now which is sad. Our waitress was nice too. I would go back if i was in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2

April H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,27,,4.0,9/21/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location usually has great dishes and pastas. Sometimes it's a miss, which I find all CF's to be inconsistent and not at the standard they used to be when first opened. I give it four stars for the quick wait times for a mall location, seems like a long wait but always faster than expected. Cheesecake here is fresh and I love their cocktails. Servers are usually friendly and attentive. My favorite is the bistro shrimp pasta or the sausage shrimp pasta and of course the fried mac and cheese. But if you want a more fresh, organic version and even bigger portions for less, check out Maggie McFly's Brookfield. Similar menus but better preparation and fresh ingredients from local farms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2

Nothing we had here was bad, in fact it was all quite tasty.  Enough of a portion for 3 people, fattening and very good oreo cheesecake and amazing hot fudge on the sundae.

Katie P.,"Danbury, CT",16,40,2,2.0,8/19/2017,Every experience I've had here has gone worse than the time before.

Will F.,"Danbury, CT",153,55,9,2.0,11/27/2016,"You'd think that this place would be awesome right? Judging by the full parking lot, the huge wait time and how great looking the restaurant actually is.  I was unpleasantly surprised, it was garbage. I don't mind waiting to get in, that's part of the deal and usually a sign of a great spot. Waiting for food forever on the other hand bothers me.  The food is just ok, it's as good as square one down the street which is barely better than diner food.  All said and done, I spoke with the manager, got a $50 credit towards my meal for the obnoxious time we spent waiting. That's great and all, but even if my meal was half the price I still wouldn't go back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2
Laura J.,"Danbury, CT",274,77,32,3.0,6/20/2017,"A frequent guest here with my father. But since seeing that this specific Cheesecake Factory didn't pass their health inspection very well, I'm a bit thrown off by that. It is a corporate restaurant - you think their standards would be higher than private family owned kitchens. The servers are rude - Sam did not offer us specials or tell us about the new dessert that came out (which is why we came there in the first place) but since our neighbors were offered the new dessert by another waiter, and we weren't, shows how some waiters and waitresses work with pride VS. Who is just there for money. Hope to find a better Cheesecake Factory location one day. I'm beginning to doubt it after multiple hiccups and bad experiences here in Danbury, Ct.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2
Katie O.,"Mahopac, NY",94,51,30,1.0,7/10/2017,"I counted seven separate problems with our meal yesterday. We arrived for dinner around 6pm and had a 20 minute wait, which we were relieved as we know Cheesecake Factory is usually at least a 45 minute wait. We were able to be seated outside and it was a perfect night to dine outside, so we were pleased with this as well. Our waitress, although friendly, was a total disaster. All went downhill after being seated. We weren't approached for a good 15 minutes after sitting down, so by the time the waitress arrived to take our drink orders we were already ready for our full order. I asked for a sprite and another 15 minutes later she came back with a water (not a sprite), and informed me they were out of spinach dip and threw the menus on our table again. Not a problem, but she then walked away and didn't come back for another 20 minutes to see if we wanted to order a different appetizer and about 35 minutes had now gone by before I could even tell her she got my drink wrong. In those same 35 minutes, we were never brought any bread for the table, despite her saying she'd bring it right out. Once she finally did bring the bread, she never brought any small plates so we ate our bread on our napkins.  Our main course finally arrived a solid hour after being seated (mind you all we ordered for our main course was a salad and a Small Plate??) and my boyfriends steak in his antioxidant salad was dry and cold. (My stuffed mushrooms were very good though). I'll chalk most of this up to it being a busy night, but cheesecake factory is expected to be able to handle a high volume of business with the amount of seating they have. Not impressed even slightly. We arrived for dinner at 6 and left at 8 due to the most miserable dining service we've ever received. Super disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2
Karran R.,"Bronx, NY",32,4,1,5.0,8/6/2017,"My favorite restaurant with my girls.  I love the food and the wonderful service.  My girls love the desert and always look at it while waiting to be seated.  My daughter loved the mango, tropical smoothie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=20
Christina Y.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/1/2017,"Food and portion sizes are fine,  but the service was awful. The server was incredibly disrespectful. I came with a number of people,  a number of which are diabetics. Each person ordered their own entree, but no drinks or appetizers, because that's all any of them can eat. The server made us feel like we didn't buy enough, never came by to check on us (but constantly did on the tables around us). He came by at the end with with a dessert menu, sort of waved it at us, and when we said no thank you, just the check, he literally threw his head back, laughed, and walked away without saying a word. He never cleared anything off the table, never topped off water, and didn't respond when we tried to get his attention a number of times.  We've eaten at this branch a number of times, and have never had an issue, but last night was unacceptable. We didn't ask to speak to a manager on the spot, because some of the guests were visiters, and we didn't want to make everyone feel more awkward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=20

Atnier R.,"Monroe, CT",18,121,73,4.0,9/27/2016,"You never know with Cheesecake Factory, as their menu is too big to be consistent from time to time, but we decided to give it another try. No wait, able to sit down quickly, but it wasn't at a booth, we were seated at an uncomfortably neighbored little table for two. For entrees, we had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the Fish'n'Chips lunch portions.  Despite being lunch portions, they were huge, which was a good thing that we didn't order the regular sizes.  Both the pasta and fish'n'chips were delicious and well-presented.  We followed up with a cheesecake that was good enough, but I have never really been wowed by their desserts, in spite of their name and reputation. At $14 dollars a lunch portion entree, it's not too bad, especially since the food did taste good and was generously portioned, and the location looks pretty inside.  Would visit again at some point. Service was impeccable.  Surprisingly pleasant and extremely attentive.  Definitely felt high-class.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=20
Jeff F.,"Brookfield, CT",0,17,27,4.0,4/10/2016,"Yes, the standard long wait for a Saturday night. One guy was going berserker on a hostess about the wait. Has he never been to Cheesecake before? Finally we got a table. For appetizers my wife and I ordered loaded tots and avocado egg rolls. Very good. The tots were crunchy outside and creamy inside. The avocado egg rolls were great too. Plenty of avocado with a green dipping sauce. Not sure what was in the sauce but it tasted like cilantro.  Dinner: teriyaki chicken was delicious. Charbroiled. Plantains were sweet and caramelized. My wife says one of the best dishes on menu. I got the sweet corn tamale cakes. Spicy and yummy. They are actually listed in the appetizer section.  To go: Apple streusel cheesecake. Haven't eaten it yet. Piece was a bit smaller than they usually give.  Love when the buzzer goes off. You feel so special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=20

My waiter was friendly and open to the idea of singing 'Happy Birthday' to me with some of the crew. Me and my tables food came out quick, i believe it's because we went at 11PM.

Paul R.,"Danbury, CT",2,21,4,5.0,5/5/2017,"My waitress was Leah and I sat for lunch at table 39 today. I had the skinnylicous beef medallions, medium rare with asparagus and mashed potato, and as always, it was delicious. I also love that it's only 380 calories and that Cheesecake displays the calorie amounts in their menus so I can stay lean! I've had this dish several times before and only one time was it a bit over cooked, but this time it was perfect as the other 90% of the time. Usually a restaurant is not this consistent but I think Cheesecake Factory has a system in place that really provides consistency. As for my service, it was truly perfect. Leah was friendly, had great timing, and it was just a great dining experience all around, including the attentiveness and friendliness of the host. Normally, I leave a 15-20% gratuity, but I left her a $30 tip on a $27 bill because it's so rare to find such polite, friendly people in the service industry.  I so appreciate this kind of effort and gladly will show my appreciation for it. Thank you Leah, like I told you when I left, ""Perfect Service""! Oh, forgot to mention, the low carb Cheesecake with strawberries was delicious!

We also love their factory nachos, unfortunately they seemed to have tweeked the recipe a bit and the cheese was like...glue. And tasted like plastic. Huge disappointment. My husband has never gotten a meal there that he just loves. I get the Sante Fe salad, which is generally a large portion and fresh. The ambience, especially in the evening, is comfortably dim...but always noisy. In general, we have a mediocre experience each time.

Brianna S.,"West Haven, CT",130,8,137,3.0,6/10/2015,"We arrived on a random Tuesday evening, just planning on grabbing a couple beers and catching up. Plans changed quickly when we saw the happy hour menu and immediately started salivating. The restaurant offers a wide range of apps from dips to wontons and full on burgers for just $5.50. We decided on the factory nachos, roadside sliders, and fried mac n cheese balls. Of these 3 dishes, we've only tried the fried mac n cheese balls before, which have been AMAZING amaze balls in the past. Tonight, however, was a different story. The balls came out hot and steamy (yes please) with marinara sauce and cheese as garnishes. First bite was crispy and awesome, but then we started noticing a slight plasticky taste. We ate them anyway because, food. We then moved onto the nachos. The chips were stale and the cheese tasted more like cheez whiz. We gave it a good try, but couldn't stomach more than 3 chips each. I know ""unprocessed"" is not the first thing that comes to mind when nachos are on the brain, but these were just disappointing. The sliders, thankfully, were very tasty. The presentation was lacking, as they looked more like McDonald's cheeseburgers, but for the happy hour price we were satisfied. The hostess was very friendly and the bartender was sociable and attentive. She kept the drinks coming, which were also on happy hour special (whoop!). I've had many great experiences at this place both with food and with staff, so I'm hoping our food encounter was just a random flub. I would definitely come back for the drink specials, and to try some different options on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=20

Had to wait so long for an attendant to assist but other than that I had fun. Oh and I couldn't figure out if my Red Sangria had beats in it or not.

So this is not a quick sit down and eat restaurant.     Now I'm not taking anything away from the wait staff at all. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Anything you ask for they willingly help please you.  On the down side the food does take quite a while sometimes. When I went the stove and other electronics had some type of malfunction and took more time than usual.  Once the food comes it is mostly worth the wait. I ordered a Mac and cheese burger and it never ceases to disappoint. It's never over cooked.  The price on the food is a little pric but not any more than you would spend anywhere else.   The cheesecake is describable in one word incredible!

Andrew B.,"Narragansett, RI",0,7,,1.0,7/19/2016,"Not the best place and an embarrassment to the chain.  Service was non existent. There were six of us. We arrived on Tuesday around 5:15, place was not busy.  We were initially offered bread with drinks. There were no utensils.  We waited for our waitress, she was a ghost. We buttered our bread with the foil wrappers from the butter. The utensils came after we ate the bread.  Our orders were taken and the meals were ok with the exception of my daughters dish, which she didn't like and didn't eat.  When the waitress came back to clean our table with the dirty plates, you would think she would ask if there was something wrong with my daughters dish...... Nope, totally clueless.  With so many choices out there, we will not be back even though the cheesecake we took home was excellent.  What a disappointment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=40

Alfred F.,"Hartford, CT",123,193,197,3.0,9/8/2014,"Came to Danbury to meet my daughter halfway, from NYC. My wife and I decided to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the Danbury Fair Mall. Having eaten at the one in West Hartford a number of times, we were gearing up for a one-hour wait. Even though they were in full dinner mode, imagine our surprise when we were sat within 10 minutes! Our waitress, Caitlyn, greeted us as she ran by with a stack of plates for another table, but returned immediately to take our drink order. The menu at CFactory can be overwhelming. It's more of a composition book then a menu, with page after page of drinks, appetizers, chicken, salads, sandwiches, and several pages of ""specialties."" One of the rules of thumb regarding the size of a menu is, the larger the selection, the less likely they can do it all good. I will say that, in our trips to CFactory, the offerings have met our expectations. The food has always been fresh, and they put a heavy emphasis on appearance, making sure every plate is a picture. My lovely wife had Chicken Marsala, and I had Spicy Chicken with roasted cashews over Brown rice. Both dishes were decent, attractively presented, and very large. If I could find anything to improve, it would be the amount of sauce on my chicken, and its consistency...a little too goopy and a little too much. Otherwise, it was tasty. The highlight of course is dessert, where you have the menu returned, and there you are looking over two pages of cheesecake varieties, and even 2 or 3 non-cheesecake sweets! we each had our favorites - Carrot Cate Cheesecake, and Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. Hard to think there was still room in our bellies, but the plates went back to the kitchen empty! This is the kind of place where you can make a date with your friends or family to meet for drinks at their upscale bar, or sit and be professionally served. In either case, you should be able to enjoy yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=40
Brandon W.,"Westside / Home Park, Atlanta, GA",0,1,1,2.0,10/16/2014,"First off for Thursday night football and how dead this place was service should have been top notch. It took this staff 10 minutes to greet us. When my cousins and I were finally greeted it was by a manager who shouldn't have had to even be put in this position to take my order.  I ordered a beer and was asked for my ID which was fine, the manager then came back 2 minutes and asked me for my ID AGAIN because she forgotten birth month which by the im 30. It then took another 7-8 minutes for them to bring me the wrong drink by finally a server. She then asked for my drink order. She was nice though (just glad for a smile at this point). I finally got my beer. Now for some good news! Hats off to the chef because my dish was AWESOME! Louisiana Chicken Pasta was my dish by the way. I have worked in the restaurant business for 10 years+ as a server and as a matter a fact I've worked at the Cheescake Factory in Virginia Beach for years a while back just to add some validity to this story.   I get it though I was with my two black cousins, one with dreads  and no one wants the $100 bill that you have to tip out for at the end of the night when the people only leave the the famous $5 black tip.  My bill was 27.07 and I left $5.41 (20 %) for terrible service as just the standard I feel servers all deserve! I still don't know who my server was by the way.

I had been to the one in White Plains, NY many times and was familiar with the menu. In comparison to the NY restaurant Danbury is smaller but equally grand. When they first opened the wait for a table was pretty long. I remember leaving without being seated after almost an hour wait. Now that the newness has phased out I was able to get a seat within 10 minutes on a Thursday night. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal here. Standard Cheesecake Factory favorites like the Steak Diane and the Chicken Madeira deliver with full flavored sauces, tastefully seasoned sides and large portions served on large plates.  The steak came out cooked to order. I tried their Shrimp Scampi which was also delicious. Nice large cloves of well cooked garlic with great balance, low acidity.  The wait staff was outstanding. I thought it was almost funny that we had close to 4 different attendants plus a manager stop by our table but they all introduced themselves, they were truly working together as a team and it was nice to see such a happy, polite and attentive staff ready to serve. They truly know what they're doing with who they are hiring here. Had the signature cheesecake for dessert. Rich and creamy with whipped cream on the side, very good.

Cheesecake Factory, no matter the location, has two problems that will annoy you: long wait times for a table (unless you go on an off hour) and the service is SLOWWWWWW.  Once you accept that, things are good. The food is pretty good. But us dessert fanatics go there for the sweet stuff. And, honestly, I can think of few things that compare to the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake. No joke. In fact, every time I've had cheesecake there (no matter the flavor), it's enough to make me dizzy. My kids shared the chocolate layer cake (the one with chocolate chips on the outside) and it was equally as good. My 5 year-old proclaimed it the best thing he's ever had in his life. :) And he's a pretty picky eater.  Had the herb crusted salmon salad for my dinner and wife had the Americana. Both excellent dishes. Oh, and the sweet potato fries are done perfectly here as well. Staff is very friendly. But, they need to hire MORE. We were there on a Sunday evening. The place was slammed. And we waited well over a half hour for our dinner. They simply can't handle the volume here. Our waiter was ""replaced"" mid-meal. He was forgetful and overwhelmed. Not sure if they fired him on the spot or he was off-shift.

My favorite thing is that if you're ever unhappy with your food and send it back, it comes out cooked to perfection. Every single time I've done this, the dish comes out flawless.

However, our waiter was almost nonexistent and often left us feeling forgotten. The patio was about 70% full, with 3-4 waiters watching tables. Our waiter seemed to be the one that was never around.

So you really have to plan ahead. We leave for shopping and get our name on the list when we arrive if this is where the kids want to dine.  We shop first then the wait is not so bad. They screwed up our reservation once . It led to an additional hour wait. My kids were starving but wanted to wait so we went to the bar.

I asked if i could get another dish for the same price. The manager said no. I decide to wait the 15 minutes.  That turned into 30+ minutes. No refills on water, nothing. So an hour with only an appetizer. At that point we asked for the check. The waiter was so kind and embrassed but the manager was very nasty and just offered to have me more food.

Mimi K.,"Southbury, CT",13,93,273,5.0,7/7/2013,"I love this place.  It is very unique. It gets 5 stars for being in a class by itself.  It is not your typical chain like TGI Friday's or Outback, but it is also not a NYC steakhouse.  The prices are higher than a Ruby Tuesdays or TGI Fridays and honestly, you can't compare the food.  The sauces and dishes at the Cheesecake Factory are very good and do not have that 'packaged' flavor that  is sometimes found in chain restaurants.  It feels fancy yet offers a casual atmosphere.  You can eat at a table, in a booth, outside or at the bar.  All the workers are friendly. There is usually current music playing in the background. The lighting is on the darker side unless you eat outside during the day.  The decor is trendy and unique. I've been there in jeans and have also seen many casual dressers dining after a day at the mall.  I've also seen other folks dressed very fancy.  Anything goes - as long as its presentable.  The menu has a huge offering. . .  Everything from salads, pastas and steaks to lettuce wraps and numerous offerings from their 'skinnylicious' menu. They have two pages of cheesecake offerings.   My absolute favorite meal is:  deep fried macaroni & cheese balls for an appetizer, Hibachi Steak and the strawberry shortcake.  I also like the plain cheesecake. The deep fried mac & cheese balls come four (4) to an order and is served on a red-sauce.  It is outstanding.  The hibachi steak is a marinated strip steak served with onions, mushrooms and bean sprouts in the sauce alongside smashed red potatoes and breaded asparagus.  The sauce is very flavorful. The strawberry shortcake is so big is is ridiculous.  It is a large scoop of vanilla ice-cream in-between a buttermilk biscuit that is surrounded by fresh strawberries and topped with whipped cream.   Too much food for one person. The portions are huge so plan on sharing or bagging it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=80

Ian S.,"Port Jervis, NY",33,163,1,3.0,3/28/2013,"(representing 2.5 stars - I should specify that this PARTICULAR Cheesecake Factory was *fine*, if I were to review the franchise as a whole, it would get 2 stars.) This is my fourth or fifth visit to assorted Factories Cheesecake, and I think I can remove the mask - it's an overpriced, slightly-more-upscale TGI Fridays with impeccable, military-level service. To those who don't eat out much, it's probably palatial. Pretty much everything is overpriced for what it is, but this is justified (depending on your attitude) by the portions being overwhelmingly big - even the salads are enough for three or four people, without exaggeration. The cheesecake wedges you get are gigantic, weighing a good pound per slice. This will please some, I suppose. I'd rather pay less to get a smaller quantity of better product, but I guess I'm insane. I had (half of) a Cuban sandwich, which was decent but not terribly meaty. Fries were somehow simultaneously very salty and slightly tasteless, though they were nice and crisp. My 'dessert' was a $6.50 glass of Sam Adams. I probably should've gotten cheesecake after all, and eaten a tablespoon of it per day for six months. They do have an obnoxiously-named (""Skinnylicious"") diet menu, which is fairly extensive, but if you're on ANY kind of diet, it's probably best to just not eat here. However, as all Factories Cheesecake seem to be sneakily located in places where there is NO OTHER OPTION AT ALL, their dimly-lit pseudo-swank will probably be around for some time yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=100

It's DIFFICULT to be healthy here, even with the new ""Skinnylicious"" menu.  My major problem with the place is that my stomach always feels odd afterwards. Whether I attempt to go healthy or not, I seem to always feel like I have eaten a brick. My best friend and I have cut visits short because neither of us felt very well. Why we keep returning, I don't know. Convenience? The mehness of the nearby Ruby Tuesdays and lack of other options? The fact that there's something for everyone?

Pam L.,"Norwalk, CT",1,5,,2.0,8/5/2012,"We went mid afternoon on Friday, having read the Yelp reviews mentioning long waits. Got seated within five minutes. Waited another fifteen minutes before our server came to tell us they were temporarily out of bread. Not a problem, we wanted only dessert. He took our order for one tea, one coffee, and two pieces of cheesecake. Five minutes later cups for the beverages arrived - one came with a dirty cream ring stuck half way up the interior of the cup. Getting a clean cup only took eight minutes. He had also forgotten the cream and sugar. After our desserts were served, he never checked back to see if we needed anything further. We had to wave at him, down the aisle to get our check well after we were done. When the table of four next to ours emptied, two young bus boys eventually removed the dishes, then used a damp cloth to smear several spots of left behind hamburger grease into a streaky, greasy residue all over the table surface; they set the table and left. The next set of diners located the greasy smears as they leaned on the table with their bare arms. They then had to wait to catch someone's eye to get the table properly cleaned. Two main points will summarize our experience:  1) This is by far the smallest CF of the six I have visited, perhaps, accounting for the reported very long waits. Other locations are multiple times bigger. 2) Cleanliness is of NO concern here. Dirty dishes, dirty tables, ketchup smeared on the menu, even most of the servers' white attire were desperately in need of washing.  Perhaps, this location can coast by on the goodwill built up by their other locations or on the strength of the company provided cheesecakes. But as a stand alone restaurant, the extreme lack of cleanliness and very slow, incompetent service would normally be a death knell. I would rather they improve, if only up to merely mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-danbury-2?start=100

I ordered the Ahi Tuna and the Chicken Di Pana. My wife had the Carlton salad. The tuna was good and came out very quickly. I wish there had been more tuna though. I felt like it was mostly avacado. My chicken was lightly breaded over a light cream sauce. My sides were broccoli and mashed potatoes. The broccoli was cooked perfectly, a little al dente. My potatoes were a large portion but were luke warm. Overall, the entre had good portions and was tastey. My wife's salad had chicken in it and was a large salad. She also said that it was tastey. We had a slice of red velvet cheesecake for dessert and it was very good. One slice was good enough for two after dinner. The service was good, just when you were wondering where dinner was, it was served. The cost of the meal was about $55 with tip and no drinks. Luke warm potatoes and the 30 minute wait are what's preventing me from giving it 4 stars. In the future it will be hard for me to justify waiting 30+ minutes to eat at a chain restaurant when you can get an awesome meal at a locally owned one.

I'm not really an impatient person, but a two hour wait time is a little extreme. I recently had the opportunity to go out to eat with my mother, and we decided on the Cheesecake Factory. This was a weekday around 3:00 in the afternoon. The positive: The staff: they were extremely helpful. The portions were rather large. The negative: It took a long time to get our food brought out to us, and when it finally was brought to us, it had a hair in it! I called my waitress over, and let her know, she removed it immediately. The manager came over, and addressed the situation immediately. But then it was another half hour to get my replacement meal.

Michelle D.,"Danbury, CT",1,14,1,1.0,4/16/2014,Went to dinner with two of my friends. I arrived ahead of time and asked the hostess if she had recently sat my friends since I thought they arrived already. She would not let me out my name on the list again insisting that I probably was on the list. It turns out we weren't so that caused us to wait even longer since more people had been added to the waiting list. Over 40 minutes later we finally get seated and our server was Damien D. He was friendly at the beginning then became very snooty soon after his friend was seated next to us in an adjoining booth. The food was not bad. I had the garlic noodles while my friends had chicken piccata and bang bang chicken and shrimp. We knew we definitely wanted dessert so we asked the he wrap our leftovers. Ordering dessert we knew that we also would like that to be placed in a to go container knowing we could not finish it. My friend also ordered a take out order for her husband. He said it wasn't a problem and went on to get our order. Good thing I checked my bag since he gave me the wrong dessert. Upon requesting the correct order he snatched the wrong one in a huff as if having to actually do work pained him. Then in a snooty tone saying my correct order of strawberry shortcake was being prepared. To pay the bill we did ask he break it down with three cards.  He said it was no problem but proceeded with an attitude. Once I received my so-called strawberry shortcake it was in a large container which looked like a scone and three what looked like soup containers. I asked Damien what he gave me and with a bigger attitude proceeded to say it's my strawberry shortcake order to go as if I'm some kind of idiot. Last I checked he should be catering to the customers who in turn pays his salary. His attitude was a complete turn off and would NOT recommend this Cheesecake Factory.

However, the kitchen was a bit heavy handed with the salt shaker.  The cheesecake, of course, was delicious.  The downsides? 80 minute wait (that took 90) for a table on a Thursday night. By the time we were seated they were quoting 2-3 HOURS for a table. Yowsers. The waitstaff was personable but a bit slow--I don't think they have their kitchen and seating workflows quite figured out yet. The booths were comfy, but the room has a lot of hard edges and consequently is a rather noisy space--not the place for an intimate supper.

Lisa W.,"Wilton, CT",12,78,1,3.0,10/21/2011,"A welcomed chain restaurant addition to what was previously a pretty pathetic restaurant selection at the Danbury Mall.. As of  the time of my visit, the restaurant had only been opened about a week, but it was a good experience. A 20 minute wait in a small space at 5 p.m. on a Thursday surprised me, since the mall itself seemed empty. Well, fortunately it was uphill from there. Staff was still training, so we had two servers, but both were very gracious to us and the baby at the table. He was immediately delivered breads and a sliced banana, which kept him from fussing.   I tried the red sangria, which was fruity-licious but a little heavy on the ice. I chose a basic chicken avocado club sandwich with sweet potato fries. Good stuff, but as somebody else mentioned in a previous review, super heavy on the salt. Brought half of it home in a doggy bag, so serving size is definitely ample. Not sure eating only this small amount of food really qualifies as enough to write a review, but hey, it's a chain, and it meets the typical standards of the chain if you have eaten at one before.
