Ellen K.,"Littleton, CO",88,61,,5.0,11/24/2017,"Please don't disappoint me Cheesecake Factory for giving you five stars. They are FAR from vegan friendly but because they have the Korean BBQ fried cauliflower bits, I will be coming here quite frequently. While the restaurant changes their menu every six months or so, staff told me they'll probably keep the cauliflower bits a LOT longer since they're so popular.  Admittedly I'm not a cauliflower fan but for this dish they are battered in rice flour, baking soda, salt, and pepper, then fried. No egg in the batter. It's been confirmed THREE times by the local restaurant manager, the Boulder CO restaurant, and corporate. The sauce itself is spicy but not fire engine hot. They come to you hot and crispy.  It comes with a ranch dip, which I don't get since it contains animal excretions. But these are so good, it doesn't need a dip. I've shared this on the Denver Vegans page on Facebook, which has more than 3,000 members. So you had better not let us down, Cheesecake Factory! P.S. This visit was to the restaurant at Southwest Plaza in Littleton, not downtown Denver.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver
M J.,"Fresno, CA",1,60,2,2.0,12/28/2017,"This was a very disappointing visit to CF. My boyfriend and I were seated right away by friendly staff. We got our drinks and put in our order right away, but that's where it all goes down hill. We ordered an appetizer and our main lunch meals and received our plain bread. (Where did the dark bread go?? Other tables had it?) While waiting for 35-40 minutes, our drinks were not refilled and we didn't get our appetizer but instead, our main lunches arrived. Without any warning regarding the hot plate, my boyfriend burned his arm on his plate twice. Finally, our waitress came up to ask us how our food was. We expressed our frustrated with her regarding the delayed food arrival, lack of appetizer, burned arm, and asked for a manager and more ketchup. Once all of these things arrived (minus the appetizer), we were almost done with our food. Waitress admits she never put in our appetizer order and that she would put it in right away, we told her just don't even put it in at that point. We were starving 45 minutes ago.  Manager came up to talk to us and didn't really seem to have much concern, just a business type ""here I'll comp your one dish and a dessert, we are sorry this happened"" kind of thing. Cool. But we weren't looking for a ""free meal"". It shouldn't have happened in the first place as the restaurant wasn't even busy. After walking by us several times, the waitress should have at least asked if we needed a refill on our drinks or checked on our food since we had been sitting there twiddling our thumbs for over a half an hour. My boyfriend's meal shouldn't have been sitting under the heater for however long it takes to burn someone via plate.  To make things even better, we received the check with a charge on it for our ""comped"" cheesecake slice and were told we had to pay for it because we were comped the appetizer... which we never received.  Once all was said and done, an hour and a half later for a burger and a salad, we finally ended up paying for my meal and our drink, which was great. But left frustrated and with a headache.  Birthday cake cheesecake, however, was the best part of the whole meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver
Frank L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,29,1,2.0,11/26/2017,"I was in Denver for Thanksgiving.  I have not been in Denver for close to 30 years, so my experience at the restaurant becomes emblematic of dining in downtown Denver.  Perusing the many comments on this CF location I know I am just going to repeat the obvious:  uneven food, uneven service.  We had a large group, 10+ people.  Food at one table was brought out 10-15 minutes before the other table.  Our other table was ready to go and I was shoveling food in my mouth to keep up.  My salad was supposed to feature avocado.  It became a game to identify the small chunks of avocado in the salad; maybe there was a slice.  Food at both tables was below standard.  Two meals were comped by management.  All of us received free cheesecake as compensation.  The cheesecake was good. So I can established that my experience was not good, and I can read through the reviews and see that other folks have experienced the same problems; uneven food, uneven service. Beyond blaming the operations of the kitchen the way our server did, I'd like to know what CF is doing to correct these deficiencies, and not just some corporate platitude statement extolling the goals.  Really, what is changing.....?  I would start with slimming down the voluminous menu.  Way to many options and something gets lost when you offer too many selections. So for downtown Denver dining, my one experience is at CF, and that really was not too choice.  Is that representative of dining in Denver?  If so, I head to my favorite places in Tucson or Phoenix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver
Abby S.,"Denver, CO",3797,2017,5538,3.0,10/3/2017,"I can't think of a better way to celebrate a 30-something birthday than a trip to REI, followed by a slice of Cheesecake Factory. That's right, folks, this is what happens when you're one step closer to 40.  This was my first visit to the Denver location, but I've had many a Cheesecake Factory experiences before: Palm Springs, Boulder, LA, St. Louis, SF Bay Area, Waikiki... They're all pretty much the same. Large portions, rich food, and A-OK drinks to boot. My personal favorite cheesecake is the raspberry white chocolate truffle. But I also enjoy the lemon raspberry cream, Reece's, or tiramisu. Who am I kidding? Cheesecake is one of my favorite foods -- you could put any slice in front of me and I'd go to town on it. I've never had to wait for a booth/table because eating at the bar is where it's at. Chat it up with the bartenders and watch them sling ridiculously large, sugary drinks to go along with the big ass entrees. Recommendation: Raspberry white chocolate truffle cheesecake + split bottle of sparkling wine. Happy birthday to me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver

Tara T.,"Denver, CO",273,85,150,3.0,8/10/2017,"Update 8/10/17: We went here last Sunday afternoon around 3:30. They were out of some flatbread my BF wanted. Not a big deal. He ordered a margarita that was served in a wine-looking glass. If he had an ice fetish he would have been in cloud 9, but no such luck. The drink was completely FULL OF ICE. He had literally 4 (normal) SIPS and it was gone.  The service was absolutely horrible. I'm not a serial complainer but damn.... and the place wasn't even busy! I get the Tuscan chicken when I go here- I finished my leftover breast today and there were about 8 spots of gristle in it that I had to spit out. Pretty disappointed with this visit, Cheesecake Factory.  __________________________ Tuscan chicken!! Do it. Very healthy and flavorful.

No longer chicken on the bone- it is now small cutlets- very dry. They didn't have order ready for delivery driver and it took a really long time. When it finally arrived, food was cold. Mash potatoes were like a brick - worst I've ever had. Called manager to see why it was delayed and he said they forgot to sauce it. He said there was nothing he could do for me since it was ordered through Door Dash. Food was terrible for the price.

Fadzai M.,"Denver, CO",146,74,111,5.0,3/19/2017,"Delicious food, amazing service, and ridiculously affordable prices in the heart of downtown Denver!!! I'm surprised this place doesn't have 10 stars. I've been coming to cheesecake factory for a couple of years now and they never let me down. The wait on a weekend is about 30 minutes but well worth it. The inside the decor is classy, they have a cute little section to shop for what seems like hundreds of different flavors of cheesecake, and a very romantic and hip dinner setting. They also have the option to dine outdoors on the patio on warm days.  Without hurting your pockets you can enjoy a nice date night, a happy hour hangout with friends, or a birthday celebration which they LOVE to do here (they always make you feel special with a cheesecake on the house).

Parker B.,"Denver, CO",39,120,144,1.0,10/30/2016,"TIME TO GO IN!!! Let me start by exclaiming I would never in any circumstance choose to come to The Cheesecake Factory. This place was in high school one of those places highschool kids took their dates cause it looked classy (inside), and the food was decent (not great, but okay).  My girlfriend while recently out of state tried another location, and found a dish she was recently impressed with, when she came back to CO she tried the dish at a local location on the 16th Street Mall in downtown Denver and was at that time equally satisfied. The dish I'm referring to is the hibachi steak, Wasabi mashed potatoes, with fried asparagus.  We arrived at the 16th Street location around 430pm 10/30/16 and everything just seemed off from the moment we entered the building. To start the ladies waiting to seat people were off in the middle of the restaurant. So when you walk in you're waiting for someone to ask you to be seated at the Desk right near the door, but no one is there, so you just wait. Then if the two ladies aren't too busy talking to one another or looking down from the middle of the restaurant they FLAG you over, just to walk us back the direction we just came from to be seated.  (I saw two people standing there at the front door for so long they, and they were never approached about seating so they just walked out.) We order two plates...  Coullette steak (rare), mashed potatoes, and green beans (my plate). My girlfriend ordered her favorite, and literally the only reason for visiting this restaurant the Hibachi Steak (extra mushrooms) medium, Wasabi mashed potatoes, and fried asparagus (tempura).  My plate comes and I immediately notice that my steak is medium to medium well (if you're a steak lover, this is a major turnoff). Charred as hell on the outside. Mashed is fine, green beans are hard as rocks. Literally, how can you ruin a RARE steak I decide I'm starving, and don't want to send it back as it seemed to take them forever to bring it in the first place (watched my girlfriend polish off the entire damn near basket of bread we were brought waiting for our meals.) I was so hungry I would have literally ate cardboard at this point.  My girlfriend starts to dive into her meal, and notices that the steak she was given in her meal is mostly gristle and fat, she informs the waiter (Dan) and he proceeds to take the entire plate (not just the cruddy steak), we've both been starving while waiting for! Now, all of a sudden a complaint over the steak translates into take confiscate the entire dish... (Thanks Dan!) While she waited another 35 minutes or so for them to fix her another meal (I'm completely done with my food at this point!!!) supposed to be a different cut of steak from a different steak plate, but they were supposed to plate it the exact same way (Hibachi style, same sides).  Didn't really go down that way at all! We received a second server halfway through our meal named ****Stephen****, he was awesome, and offered to try and rectify the situation some (comp'd cheesecake, Thank you for that!), but between the long waits, bad food, and crappy service from the first waiter we were both over it. The manager had came initially and spoke to my girlfriend after the first plate was messed up, but basically encouraged her to just choose another plate ""as he had no way of being able to tell the quality of the other steaks"" for the meal (he had no idea, that this woman was not interested in anything else on their menu).  The manager never revisited the table to see how the replacement meal turned out. I've had better service at Dennys from managers. The second steak was a better cut, but hardly had any mushrooms whatsoever(let alone extra as she had ordered originally), had no tempura asparagus, etc.  Like when you have your appetite set for something in particular and they mess it up, you kinda just want to leave. We waited so long for our check to come we contemplated walking out of the restaurant at least 7 times. Stephen, later gave the issue back to Dan to fix cause I think he was wanting to get away from the issue. I'm almost happy they ruined my girlfriends taste for this spot, maybe I will never have to come back to this God forsaken place again!!! I'm not sure if the kitchen was just off, or what the hell it was going on with the staff, etc. but people don't want to pay their hard earned money for bullshit. Eat here at your own risk, I could think of at least twenty places in this area I could go for a better meal and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver
Kevin M.,"Denver, CO",89,2,,1.0,10/31/2017,"Original review 10/20/17  I have to say that it was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant.  I ordered a MEDIUM RARE steak and actually saw it sit under a heat lamp for over 30 minutes... Can you imagine the shoe leather steak they tried to serve me?  After a 45 minute wait my wife and I told the Manager to send the steak back to the cook and let HIM EAT IT!  We will NEVER RETURN! UPDATE.... If I could give a NEGATIVE 5 STARS... I would!  This is a followup to my previous post regarding the Medium RARE steak that sat under the heat lamp for 30 minutes and served to me looking like shoe leather.  Well today I got the most pathetic apology letter with absolutely NO RESOLUTION AT ALL!  They didn't offer jack ""S"" to try to keep me as a customer!  My wife and I have eaten there on many occasions, as we both work downtown Denver.  It will be a cold day in hell before we go back.....

Anthony B.,"Denver, CO",4,8,,1.0,9/19/2017,"TL;DR - Don't order Cheesecake Factory off of Postmates. Let me preface this review by saying we ordered from Postmates, and having worked in the food industry for several years, I'm well aware that you can't judge food from delivery, as you're removing it from it's natural environment. However, I've had both positive experiences with Postmates *and* other Cheesecake Factory locations in the past, and my last experience was not something that left my girlfriend and I wanting to return.  We ordered the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, a classic dish that so many people have grown to love. Being a former chef and having made this regularly, I reached peak lazy when we resorted to ordering from Postmates at 10pm on a Saturday night. (our first mistake? As I could have whipped up an amazing concoction if I had the materials necessary)... But that's beside the point. Anyway, the first thing we noticed about this dish was that it was not typical of a Cheesecake Factory portion. Normally when I go to Cheesecake, I can leave with more than enough food for two people. Not this time. The next thing we noticed was that our pasta showed up cold. Like really cold. This is one thing I can forgive, as I made the decision to order delivery. However, the chicken was stale, the noodles were barely cooked, and the sauce was non-existent. This pasta, as a born-and-bred Italian, made me want to give up pasta forever and become a leaf-eating vegan.

We went in the afternoon with a handicap individual and ask for a booth to accommodate her that is easiest to get in and out, less pain for her and the hostess said that was only one booth in the entire restaurant we could sit at or its going to be over a 45 minute wait for our small party of three even though when you looked around there must have been only 20 customers in the entire restaurant itself, obviously they're short on staff and the hostess said most of the sections were closed..They gave us a table that was completely circular very difficult for the handicapped individual to get in, and the hostess did not care nor the waiter when I asked them about the poor table  accommodations. Already not getting typical cheesecake factory service we sat down 10 minutes later bread came out and the waiter and then another 10 minutes past before the drinks arrived at 20 minutes after sitting down I am astonished because there were hardly any other guests in the restaurant! When the bread arrived it was not properly wrapped in a cloth napkin for some reason it look like they were disposable and napkins set on top of the metal with the bread touching the basket everywhere pictures are displayed to show this disgustingness lack of sanitary conditions for the bread. The waiter was very rude would not explain anything on the menu and only came to the table twice in the hour and a half we were there and he also clocked out of his shift before our table was gone we asked for help and they said he already went home for the day I cannot believe to be so disrespectful to your table while leaving them and also being rude to them while rolling his eyes at our table when we were asking questions. Our table wanted to talk while we ate that is why we came in early knowing that there would not be a lot of people unfortunately we could not talk or catch up because the table was never cleared it, it was disgusting there was a sauce on the table even and the waiter came by and said oh my and walked away never cleaning it pictures are displayed also how awful the table locked at this not clean Cheesecake factory standards.

Taungporn C.,"Denver, CO",1,5,4,1.0,2/28/2017,"Had dinner here a couple of times but had never written the review. The restaurant itself looks good, servers have quite slow service and response. Food is ok.  Here is the real bad thing that happened to me tonight which convinced me to write this such bad experience. After finished my meal, I provided 2 gift cards as I bought from this exact restaurant location at the end of last year to pay for the meal. Ten minutes after I checked, the server came back and informed me that one of the two cards didn't go through. I showed her that I just checked the gift card balance at their cashier just right before I got seated (I also provide her the paper that I received as an evidence of gift card balance checking which was clearly stated everything they need to know to prove that I really had that amount until the server took my card for check). The server then left my table again (about 10 minutes) and came back with acted manager. The manager told me that after he tried every single way to check my gift card on their computer, it still came out that this gift card cannot be used because it had 0 balance in it. He also asked me (not very polite manner) whether I used it after I had checked the balance at their cashier. Wait!? Is that what the manager of the well-known restaurant should ask their customers? It's like I knew that I have already used that card and I still used it to pay for the food. Come on! even little child knows what should he do in this situation. The manager still tried to find out if I misunderstood or I lied by trying to check the balance of the gift card online. Absolutely, he couldn't find anything but the balance was zero. I spend almost 30 minutes at that time to wait for the checked out process and that made me missed the bus to my home. I then tried to figure out by myself that what's really happen to me. So, the first thing I did is to call the gift card department. The gift card representative informed me that the gift card had been charged for the left amount during the period of time that the server brought my card to check. I let the GC representative talked to the manager. Thank god that he didn't accuse me whether that was the real cheesecake factory gift card representative. The truth came up that I told the truth even I didn't know what's really happen to the charging process, I guess it's because of their system or human error. I had never experienced this bad service before since the problem came to the manager, his reaction disappointed me a lot. The manager who suppose to have power and knowledge to manage the situation like this professionally but came up doubting his customers. Such an unprofessional habit of the restaurant manager. I could say that I was very angry at that time. I felt like someone slammed their hand on my face because I want to eat for free. Someone might ask 'Why don't you just simply provide another card for them to charge?'. I will just ask them back 'Why would I paid more since I had already paid them for the gift card?' Was I impatience enough to give them a chance since they already spend more than 30 minutes of my time fixing the problem?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=60

And the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Brownie Cheesecake may look decadent, the brownie layer was an overkill, and not even that exceptional. The Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake? Too syrup-y and too ""confectionery"", if you know what I mean. Note to self: always look at the cheesecakes at the counter before deciding.

If you're in the mood for something sweet check this place out as they have a huge variety of cheesecakes to choose from! Ask the waiter what their favorites Are and they always give great recommendations and never steer you in the wrong direction! Besides the delicious dessert offered here, the service was good. They had a table for two ready for us in about ten minutes which was great, because it gave us a little time to look at the cheesecakes before we sat down so we had an idea of which ones we wanted. Great dessert spot if you're around 16th street you will never be disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=80

After a $500 tab for my family.... And it was special occasion.... ""Sorry."" Considering we watched people at tables around us be served and come and go..... He really should have done more than saying, ""sorry.""  My take away, the Cheesecake Factory is SORRY. I will NEVER go back.

Then they tried to fix it, and brought the same wrong order a second time!  I ordered a quesadilla and the first thing he asked was, do you want chicken in that. I responded yes because that's that only way I ever eat them. He said ""great, I'll get the order's put in.  Well you can probably guess all I got was a sticky cheese quesadilla. I showed him they error and he says, Oh, you DID want chicken in that??  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I was speaking English when I said that and you confirmed what I said. Later 2 employees scrambling to fix my daughter's order and they leave in a rush. At no time did either them, or anyone for that matter ask if we needed our drinks refilled. The service was just sad and disappointing all around. Prices are over-inflated, and on top of all that I'm pretty sure it was the shrimp that were likely undercooked that made me a bit ill last night.

However this is the ""cheesecake factory"" and their cheesecake is amazing!! Over the years I've had the fortune of trying over half of their flavors and let me just say every single one is a slice of heaven (Especially the Peppermint bark) if you love sweets, this is the place for you! Sadly the life changing cheesecake simply cannot make up for the service and food. I've been here numerous times and (other than dessert) have left disappointed every single time. The staff is one of the most unorganized groups I've ever seen, the moment they become somewhat busy they turn into a group of chickens with their heads cut off... Additionally the food is very bland and does not offer anything that stands apart from a red robin, olive garden or Applebee's. Every dish is very simplistic and could honestly be made at home.

The sourdough is my favorite and they always give you plenty of butter for the bread. I ordered the cuban sandwich and it was amazing! The bread was crispy and buttery, and the ham and pork belly was seasoned well and not too salty. I'm watching my calories, so I asked for no cheese and the mayonnaise on the side.

One of my friends referred to this place as ""Slavecake Factory."" - Very high calorie density, 2 days worth of calories packed into one sitting at this place. - High prices, low quality. This food ingredients sound fancy, but it is corporate, be honest with yourself. Don't come here. Denver has so many impressive local restaurants nearby, just walk a few extra blocks.

Sunday Brunch, Brûlée French Toast and a side of extra crispy bacon. The French Toast is a large helping with a couple of strawberries on top and the side of sweet brûlée to pour over the toast.  The bread was slightly crispy on one side where it had been on the griddle but was cooked throughout for the size of the pieces used.  Overall it had good flavor and was plenty for one person to consume. On the down side, I've gone to a number of CCF in the past and the overall experience I had with my party on this day was much like all the others.  Pretty sub par.  I will probably just stop going to the Cheesecake Factory as a whole due in part to the combined poor experiences I've had over the many years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=80

Melissa W.,"Golden, CO",0,4,,4.0,10/3/2016,"I love everything about The Cheesecake Factory: You have a lot of meals you can decide from, the water does not really taste like chlorine (which is a huge plus!! We don't have water that tastes like chlorine in our home country and I don't want to get used to water that tastes like chemicals), the cakes are heavenly good, the waitress was the most nice and patient waitress I've met so far, you get free bread to snack on while deciding on what you want to eat. The only downside is that the meals are on the pricier side. (Burgers around $13, pasta around $16) When I went there this weekend for an early lunch, my friend and I were the first people at the restaurant and could save a good table on the patio. The restaurant fills pretty quickly, so we were lucky to have such a good table. As it was our first time there, it took us longer than usual to go through the menu, because they have so many options. They even have a smaller menu with low calorie meals, which I find is pretty nice. The waitress was very patient with us, because even after 20 minutes of sitting there, looking through the menu, we still couldn't decide on what to eat. She even offered her help to find a meal for my friend, after asking if she's in the mood for burgers, pasta, sandwiches, etc. I asked for a mix of the ""skinnylicious veggie burger"" and the normal veggie burger and without she took my order without questioning it. We both enjoyed our meals and ordered  some cheesecake for dessert. The Oreo cheesecake is heaven on earth! The slices are worth the price of $6.95-7.95! I hardly spend a lot of money on dessert, because I'm pretty specific when it comes to pastries, but I can 100% recommend that cake! We also had the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake, but that one was too heavy for me, even though I love Reese's. I'm not giving 5 stars, because I think the prices are too high, but you definitely come here every now and then when you want to have a good time with great food! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=80

I have this tradition where I buy a whole cheesecake from here every year for my birthday and I try to get a different one every time. I love the chocolate cheesecakes, the red velvet cheesecake is to die for, and the Reese's one is so sweet I can only stomach half a piece of cheesecake at a time. But my absolute favorite cheesecake is the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. It has just enough chocolate brownie cake and equivalent amounts of regular New York style cheesecake. Looking back at the picture of the cake I got last year, my mouth is drooling as I'm typing this. No matter your preferences, there IS a cheesecake for you here; they have so many incredible flavors.

I've frequented locations in several different states.  Last night,  my husband and I came to this location for the first time.  We expected a wait but we also requested first available open seating on the patio.  When we were starting to be escorted to a seat inside,  my husband asked what happened with the patio seating. She looked flustered but she apologized and looked for available seating.  When she said we would need to wait my husband told her waiting was out of the question so please go ahead and just seat us.  She responded.. ""well I don't want to seat you if you are angry"". We didn't know how to process that so we took a seat and tried to deal with it.  It went downhill from there. We were sitting next to an obnoxious group of ladies and their waiter leaned over our table to take a picture of them without any heads up.  He didn't even ask us if it would be OK.  It totally interrupted our conversation and quite frankly it was pretty rude. We had to sit there and back up so that he could take pictures of them.  I hate when people lean over me and I really hate it when they do it at a restaurant. My husband spoke with Connor who is one of the managers and he was very professional and courteous.  We decided to stay and eat... until my husband realized that his steak wasn't cooked. He has to have his steak well done.  This steak was red on the inside.  Completely unacceptable!

No problem, we expected that. This restaurant is smaller than the CFs I've been to and it's especially crowded up front by the hostess stand. Waited outside in the street and was buzzed back at around 5:40. Fair enough. Then was told to form another line where we waited another thirty minutes while harried employees struggled to get organized and seat us. Seriously. Thirty more minutes. We soon realized that there was no rhyme or reason to when people were being seated and noticed that people who approached the desk were seated next. We did the same and the hostess just shrugged, grabbed menus and took us to our table. Wtf.  Service was spotty. Yes, it was busy, but all CFs are, and the well managed locations still provide excellent service.  Food was good.  Disappointing experience.

It was our fault that we did not ask the price up front since it was not listed on the menu. I ordered a margarita under the same circumstances. When we got our check we were floored. The Mojito was $12.50 for what could not have been an 8 ounce glass. My Margarita was $9.50 and it was served in a modified and small wine glass. (And to add insult to injury, after lunch we set out on 16th street and 3 doors down a restaurant was advertising their Mojito's for $5.00.) The food was equally proportioned and pricey.

Either I need to enter into a food eating competition ASAP, or The Cheesecake Factory is stingy when it comes to serving up HEALTHY GRUB! I ordered the Tuna Tataki Salad (seared tuna with leafy greens and a sliced tomato) along with a side of grilled asparagus and a side of olive oil dressed green beans. The dish was delicious but, it definitely felt like an appetizer portion.  My dining companion ordered the Shrimp Scampi and the Steak Diane. She was served a MASSIVE dish that was mostly filled with EVIL MASHED POTATOES (a low-carbers nightmare, not that she is a low carb eater or anything)... And a sprig of basil. She was HOPING there would be far more greens on her plate, but nope, the soupy potatoes were the vegetable of choice. She proceeded to not finish the potatoes and instead ordered a side salad.  As for me, I wolfed down my tuna in literally a minute and proceeded to complain that I was still HUNGRY. I have a wolf in my stomach eating the food I ingest... I swear. So I discussed with the waitress how I might be able to get some salmon with more green beans. She was nice and tried to figure out the most cost effective way for me to fill my trap and it worked! I got the grilled salmon and green beans, just the way I wanted.  Of course... I was STILL hungry, but I am just a freak so I decided to slap my baby wolf and asked for the check when I was done eating.  I always remember the Cheesecake Factory being absolutely delicious.

J B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,209,110,2.0,7/5/2015,"Disappointing.   The Cheesecake Factory usually produces consistently good food. Not this time.  Maybe it was a second crew cooking on the 4th of July.  We ordered nachos with chicken to start. It looked like someone had thrown it on the plate then realized we'd ordered chicken and grabbed a handful of the closet chicken in the kitchen, smothered in a horrible dried orange sauce. Yuck! The white chili was okay, but when there is twice the amount of rice than chili, it looks like they're going cheap, while still charging $$.  The spicy chicken sandwich was tasty, but again thrown on the plate, with most of the chicken, smothered in sauce, missing the bun. The most disappointing was the chicken and biscuits. The chicken was black on the bottom (not burnt but black from a not clean grill,) then covered in a bland, lumpy sauce with soggy vegetables. The biscuits were overcooked and dry. We had this boxed up for our dog.  We thought we'd have dessert, but decided against it given our experience.

I love their food (something for everyone), love the cheesecake (though it's much better to share a piece without whipped cream if you're trying to be relatively good), and service is pretty consistant.   Also, if ordering off the regular menu, realize that you don't have to finish it all in one sitting.  You're likely an adult who should know when to stop eating and can make a $15 meal last for three... just sayin'...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=160

This place is great for a romantic date and a large party of friends and family. We started off with an appetizer of bread sticks with a soft, creamy buttery filling which was mouth watering and flattering. The server brought a large circle of bread with sesame seeds on top, which left my mouth a fan of their bread and pastries. The menu has a large variety of items to choose from, that I'm not sure it's possible to try everything on the menu! I eventually ordered a Blue Cheese B.I.T. Burger topped with their crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion rings and lots of blue cheese! The burger was so fancy, that the top bun was not even placed on top of the burger. The Blue Cheese burger was also a tall burger with lots of onion rings stacked on top the delicious beef patty. I was very much in love when I tried my first bite and enjoyed the beauty of the art that this burger very much provided for me.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to have an amazing time with a date, friends or with family. The Cheesecake Factory comes with so many items on their menu, that this place is perfect to try new things. I know I definitely will when I come a second time around.

I chose to go with the Fried Macaroni and Cheese Burger with a side of fries. I read the description and never looked at anything else. I was not disappointed. they always have the tastiest french fries, cut to perfection and crispy all around. This burger was so flavorful. I like a well done burger, and this was cooked as ordered but still juicy. The fried macaroni was so tasty, and I was worried it would be too battered, but just the opposite. The macaroni was creamy and complimented the burger perfectly. To add another dash of sin to the dish, they give an additional splash of a cheese sauce over the fried macaroni.  The hamburger was huge, so half was plenty for me, and the leftovers were just as delicious. In the end, everyone was too full to even consider a piece of cheesecake.

Cheesecake was good, but again - was it $7.50 good?  I just can't say it was.  For my dime, I would have taken a smaller portion at a slightly lower price. Overall, it was a good experience, but the wait, the price, and the fact that for that price the food didn't knock my socks off made it less enjoyable.

Taylor D.,"Smithfield, RI",2,31,,2.0,11/15/2015,"My friends and I were in town for a convention at the Colorado Convention Center. We decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner one night, and we certainly wished we had chosen elsewhere. We waited about an hour for a table, but there was nowhere for us to wait comfortably. We hung out up against a wall, but continuously had to move out of the way because the staff needed to get through with dirty dishes. Once we were sat, our waiter (Russ) came right over to greet us, so it seemed to get better from then on. Wrong. It took over 15 minutes for our glasses of wine to come to the table after we ordered them. Then, once our food finally came out, two of my friends orders came out wrong. One of my friends asked for a side Caesar salad with her burger. Her burger came out burnt and with a small salad of mixed greens and no dressing. It took about 20 minutes for us to get out waiter's attention just to bring her some ketchup so she could attempt to eat her burger. My other friend ordered the steak dinner, which is kind of hard to mess up. She is allergic to wheat, and her dinner came out as steak tips cooked with noodles (which it does not say in the menu)? Again, it took 20 minutes just to get out waiter's attention in order to explain that she could not eat the meal if the noodles were cooked with the steak, in order for him to take it back to the kitchen. He said a new one would be right out. About a half an hour later, when the rest of us were done eating, her replacement meal came out, where we had to ask for it to be boxed because we did not want to stay there anymore. A manager never came over to the table, and they didn't even take my friend's meal off of the bill or offer her anything else. I've worked in the restaurant business, and I typically give the wait staff the benefit of the doubt, but our waiter never apologized for the mix-up and took forever just to bring us our bill.

Caroline D.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,10,2,3.0,2/20/2014,"Although I do like the Cheesecake Factory, I still wonder why people wait one or two hours to get a table at this restaurant on any given day.  Even though the food is pretty decent, the first question I have is whether the wait is worth it.  Anyway, I was there with my friend and since we were close the to restaurant we decided to have dinner.  My friend got a martini - I was impressed by its size and I started off with a Margarita.  Drinks were good and arrived to the table in less than 3 minutes.  For appetizer we order calamari, the waiter told us that it was his favorite.  It was not bad, especially after dipping it with the sauce that came with it.  For main course we had a Chinese Salad which we felt it was average and we also had Mahi-Mahi, which was too fishy.  We told the waiter about it and the manager stopped by our table and let us choose another dish and he bought the Mahi-Mahi.  We replaced it with a Miso Salmon that was way better.  For dessert we had the White Chocolate  Raspberry cheesecake and it was delicious.  We also got coffees, one decaf and one regular, they were both cold.  It was interesting because I would assume that they are kept in different containers so it was strange to see that both were equally cold.  Anyway, service was good so I won't complain, I'll give them another chance, especially since we have been at this restaurant in several occasions and we have experienced a much better time than our last visit; it was not too bad but we have simply had better experiences at a restaurant that has the potential to average four start but due to inconsistency is sending a mix message.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=200

Becca R.,"Denver, CO",66,332,107,5.0,1/21/2013,"I went with a party of 2 for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. If you've ever been to cheesecake factory, or if you've read the Yelp reviews, you know about the portion sizes. This is a double portion, so make sure to split your entree in half and box it before you blow your pants out.  The service was literally some of the best I have had in Denver. Trudy, our waitress, kept our drinks completely refilled and even brought us strawberries with our cheesecake because that is one of her favorite additions. The food is delicious and comes out piping hot.  The only negatives I would have is: -It is always packed. -The seating is very cramped. They tried to stick us in a tiny table elbow lengths away from another couple and we just requested a different table, which they took care of right away. -This place is loud. I think it's probably due to all of the marble used throughout the decor, but expect to have to raise your voice. -Parking. Though this isn't a problem for me, as I walk, anyone that drives into downtown is going to have to street park or find a garage and pay while you eat.  -It's so pricey. You're looking at $50 for 2 entrees and 2 cheesecakes. And, while I really wanted a drink I just can't do it at $10 a pop. But, if you do what we did and eat lunch and then take home half of everything for dinner, it's not horrible.

Then, our poor server got 6-7 tables at the same time and he was definitely rushed and feeling overwhelmed.  We had to wait quite a while to get our food and when it did arrive, the order was incorrect, so it had to be sent back, which increased our wait time (and we were starving!). The food was average that night, and the portions at Cheescake are huge, so that always means two meals for the price of one!  Our server, however, was very attentive, all things considered and he was very apologetic and quick to make things right for us.   The cheesecake itself here is always a great choice, so you can never go wrong with any of their selections.  My personal favorite: Banana Cream Cheesecake.  It's really light and fluffy and not overly sweet.  Oh!  and they do brunch on Sundays.  The waffles are very very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=200

You can generally expect to have a good wait time to get into a seat because the food is awesome. Do not mistake this wait time for poor service because it's generally anything besides lacking.  At this one in particular, you can also sit outside. Even on a brisk spring or fall evening it's comfortable because they'll crack up the outdoor heaters just for you. It's very nice as long as there's not a breeze. They'll start by bringing you a little bread, and all of it is worth trying out and making sure that they've got more coming for you. The drinks that they'll offer are pretty varied, from general bar items to very specialty drinks, but sometimes the beer selection is lacking oddly enough. Appetizers are delicious and as you can expect to find throughout the entire menu, it's all over the place. You can get a dozen kinds of pizza or chicken or a delicious pasta for that matter.  The main event though is of course.....the cheesecakes. I try to order a different one each time that I've gone in, but I've been to different locations dozens of times, and I haven't eaten the same one twice yet.

When your hungry and waiting, and the restaurant is at half capacity, that is a long time. The industry tries to keep it under 8 minutes.  I ordered the burrito. It looked very nice, and it was huge, but it was very bland. Perhaps I am spoiled being in Colorado, where burritos and green chili are great. I ate about 3/4 and left the rest.

As we entered the door, my friend whispered, ""Giant serving sizes, giant serving sizes."" She wasn't kidding. I have a few questions for the Cheesecake Factory higher-ups. Question #1: if you have a menu the size of a bible, why aren't there any gluten-free options? When I asked the server if he could recommend any GF menu items he replied the Factory doesn't have a gluten-free menu (didn't expect one) but they could make most of the items GF. After inquiring about the tamales, I was told the tamales didn't have gluten but the sauces did, so the tamales would need to be served dry. I get it. The way to make stuff gluten-free is to omit some of the primary ingredients that define the dish. Looks like another salad for me. Question #2: if you offer a salad titled, ""Pear and Endive,"" why are there not more than five or six teeny-tiny pieces of pear in the pound of food in the bowl? Question #3: if you offer portion sizes that could feed a family, and you park your place near a convention center where out-of-towners have no place to refrigerate leftovers, why wouldn't you reduce food waste by offering smaller  servings at smaller prices?

Eating half of each and drinking the passion tea which tastes like the tea I get from Hawaii, is the bomb.

The food isn't all that great, and the servers usually take a while to bring food and drinks to the table. In the front of the restaurant by the bar, I feel like they crammed as many tables along the wall as possible because you practically have to stick your butt in another diner's face to get into the seats.

I'm a fan of large portions, I have a major sweet tooth, and I love fresh warm bread... it's a ménage à trois of deliciousness and Cheesecake Factory is the eHarmony of cuisine.  It's hard to not find at least one thing you enjoy from their novel-like menu.  I feel like I've just read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy after ordering my entree.  In all honesty, the food is moderately priced considering the portions, and I'm a rather frugal individual.  The drinks, however, not so much. Next comes my favorite portion of the meal... dessert.  I've even ordered it first then had dinner - give it a shot to mix things up if you're so inclined.  I'm a huge cheesecake fan and have probably tasted at least half of their cheesecake menu (30+ selections in total) with my favorite being the Caramel Pecan Turtle.  Depending on your tastes they're all quite phenomenal; as they should be if it's in the name of the restaurant. I'll admit one major flaw is the typical long wait you'll experience on weekends or holidays.  So if you're looking to get in and out without enjoying your food, then by all means stay clear from the Cheesecake Factory.  Otherwise, kick back and enjoy the wide selection of food, good company, and relaxing atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=240

Luckily they seated us somewhere where we had space for our luggage--big plus! We ordered an appetizer (boneless wings) and my husband got a salad, while I got their soup and salad lunch. Unfortunately, our salads (and my soup) came out... before our appetizer. A few seconds later, our appetizer came. I was annoyed, but I wasn't going to push the issue... it is what it is, whatever. But the guy who delivered the appetizers apologized to us. Then our waitress came, and she apologized as well. And THEN the manager came over, and he apologized. They felt really bad! Unfortunately, my food was not very good. The salad was very bitter, and the broccoli cheddar soup tasted like thick broccoli water. Bummer. My hubby's salad was better--a staple of ours when we visit other cheesecake factories. Overall, it was mehh.  But then the bill came. And wouldn't you know it... they comped the appetizer!

Much better than the frigid ice chest inside. The people watching is pretty hilarious...both the patio patrons and 16th Street. + 1 star for the extensive menu options featuring ahi. For some reason I was in the mood for ahi and not having eaten at the Cheesecake Factory more than twice in my life, I wasn't sure if their huge phone book of a menu could deliver. But it did! Ahi tartare, ahi carpaccio, ahi tempura rolls, wasabi crusted ahi and an ahi salad almost all made it onto my plate. I went with the salad and it was fresh and light with avocado, tomato, mixed greens, ginger and a soy drizzle. Nothing earth shattering but fed my craving. + 1 star for our friends who suggested dining here on their dime...thank you for saving up years of gift cards! Because otherwise I wouldn't have been tempted to come here. The portions were even more disgustingly huge than I remembered. My husband's cobb salad could have easily fed all four of us.

That one has went quickly downhill over the years, but not Cheesecake Factory. It serves high quality everything. I have been all over the menu. I have yet to find something I don't like. As a child. I would always get the Four Cheese Pasta. Penne Pasta, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Romano and Parmesan Cheeses, Marinara Sauce and Fresh Basil. Also served with Chicken. This is one of the reasons I weighed over 300 lbs. Around 15 years old I realized what carbohydrates are and stopped eating it til I lost some weight.  Anyway, this is a decadent and rich plate of unhealthiness. With 30 grams of saturated fat, 1900 milligrams of sodium and 134 grams of carbs, this is one of the worst things you can put in your body. I don't care. It's delicious.  I recently went with my girlfriend. She ordered the teriyaki chicken. I rolled my eyes. ""Really... Teriyaki chicken. We have all these great pastas, steaks and seafood, and you choose teriyaki chicken."" I said. I'm not a huge fan of any teriyaki. I thought it would be a waste of a trip to order an out of place item like that. Boy was I wrong! This was the most amazing piece of chicken I have ever had. From the grilled pineapple to the perfect char on the chicken to the tender and moist inside of the meat. It was a masterpiece served with steamed rice. I ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Caramelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce. It was fantastic. Creamy and savory. A dish with perfect harmony. I was surprised by the cheese sticks. Obviously made in-house. Not your typical cheese sticks. Very good. I've been there many times and had many dishes. I wont describe all of them . Just know, they are all good. Of course I have to mention the cheesecakes. As Eugene Struthers would say. They take it to a whole nutha level. (google it if you don't remember Madtv) Always rich (very rich) and sweet. Sometime it's hard to save room with the ginormous portions of the entrees.

Daniel M.,"Waltham, MA",95,344,,4.0,8/17/2009,"Most of the Cheesecake Factories I've visited are on the East Coast and based on a rather unscientific survey I'd rank this one at the top. Food was good...there were four of us, and we started with the yummy potstickers as appetizers. one of whom had the chopped steak, another who tried a whitefish dish, another with a 12 oz steak over rice and me who had a lightly dipped batter fried chicken over pasta with pesto. While my dish was a bit oily I heard raves about the fish and chopped steak. Portions for all of us were very large - we all ended up taking something home. For the desserts...one of us had Linda's Fudge Cake but required the assistance of the other three to finish. The rest of us partook of the Dutch Apple Caramel Struesel variety, rich and tasty and a perfect complement to our meals. Food was clearly above average and a better than what I've found in most of this chain's restaurants. What really distinguished this one, though, was our service. Generally the biggest knock I have against the Cheesecake Factory is its very slow service; however this one was a welcome exception. Elizabeth W., our server, was impressive in every respect, from her promptness, to the way she anticipated and answered our questions, to her knowledge of the menu.

It just makes large amounts of food. Quantity doesn't always equal quality. However, the one thing this place does specialize in is their cheesecake and it doesn't disappoint! The pasta meal I ordered left something to be desired and had the typical olive garden, this sauce is too heavy for this meal type feel. The avocado egg rolls where a new venture for me and I liked them more for their novelty than for their greasy taste. They do offer over 50 options for cheesecake (decisions, decisions). I went with the white chocolate macademia nut (the waitress suggested it), and while it was yummy, it was also super rich. The tuxedo mousse cheesecake my friend had looked divine. The prices are what you'd expect for one of these trendy chains but at of all the chain restaurants we visited in Denver, this was my favorite. The only thing I'd like to add is that this place was dim. Infact, I think this was the darkest restaurant I've ever eaten in.

Having never been to the Denver CF, my boyfriend and I stopped in one night while strolling down 16th Street Mall for dinner.  Initially we sat outside on the patio, but opted to move in as soon as the equine crap stench wafted over us, as the horse-drawn carriage strolled by. The waitress was busy, but accomodated our request to move, even as our appetizers were coming to the table by another server.  We split a cajun shrimp jumbalya entree, and it was tasty with big, fat shrimp and spicy sausage.  The ahi tuna tartare tapas plate was decidedly good, too. The asian pork taco tapas things on sticky, thick buns - not so good. We sent it back because the pork tasted dry and cold, and the buns were thick and sticky, not light and fluffy like they should be. That aside, our server (both of them, since we moved inside to another section) were friendly and mostly attentive. We had a great cheesecake dessert, although I don't remember which it was. Tiramisu or carmel something - anyways, it was great. All in all, an OK dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=300

Excellent ambiance, great service, casual yet sophisticated.. Excellent menu or all sorts of different anythings you can think of. The favorites of mine are: most of the salads, especially the tostada one, I get portobellos grilled instead of the chicken as I am vegetarian.. So big and so damn good, I never finish it, especially with that awesome bread n butter they load you with, the avocado egg rolls, SO good, oh my god!!!! And the tamarind sauce to dip in is superb.. Brilliant.. The Thai lettuce wraps are so awesome.. Fun to eat as you assemble them by hand and do not need silverware, comes with carrots, noodles, cabbage, I get portobello, but it normally has chicken, cucumbers, sprouts, etc and those awesome peanut and tamarind jalapeño sauces.. The fry bread sandwich is EXCELLENT! The burgers are excellent, the fries, just everything is excellent, honestly. I love the painted ceilings and walls. The cheesecake is of course amazing, I love the crazy ones like the cookie dough one or the pineapple upside down cheesecake. Only drawback is there are no reservations accepted..

MY.

I'm super easy going and don't expect a lot, but I seriously had the worst service I have ever had in my entire dining out life. I was there on Sunday evening, it wasn't too busy because it was about 10, The two of us, showed up and requested the patio, there was wait which was totally cool, the hostess was super friendly and we headed to the bar to grab a drink while we waited. The bartender was on it. Very nice and made us feel comfortable. Then we were called to our table within 5 min of getting a drink. We went to the table it took about 5 min for the server Neil to come over, he didn't introduce himself, if appeared annoyed that we already had drinks, He said "" are you going to eat? what do you want?"" We didn't even have a chance to look over the menu. So we asked him to give us some time and then the service just got worse from there, I saw the other waiter go to his tables way more than I even saw our waiter, After about 15/20 min wait, we ordered our food, then didn't see the waiter again until we were about 1/2 way thru our meal. I ran out of wine and wanted another glass, I had to as the other waiter to find our waiter so I could order another glass, then he seemed to be annoyed, then when he came back out to the patio, he didn't even bring the glass of wine, then about 10 min later I got my glass of wine. My friend had finished his food and I needed a box so I asked to have him box up my leftovers. The night was ending, he didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. I wanted cheesecake to take home, so since he wasn't going to ask - I asked for a slice of cake and the check. I don't know what his issue was but he was extremely unprofessional, his appearance was not up to par (his pants were halfway down his butt), and he just didn't seem to want to be there. Oh and to top it all off, I went to heat up my leftovers today and he threw in the ramekins for the sauces (from the restaurant) no lids, they spilled all over and were dried out. So ridiculous!

steve c.,"Denver, CO",2,95,,1.0,10/14/2009,"GLUTTONY FACTORY Nutritionally, Cheesecake Factory is calorie hell because of the ""Big Gulp"" theory: huge plates of food drowning in fatty sauces and/or cheese. This appeals to the American ""more for the money"" theory. There are smaller portions available for just a dollar or two less. Cheesecake Factory hides their nutritional information under lock-and-key, as does Quiznos (also known for excessive fat and sugar content and high calorie products). A slice of the basic CF cheesecake has 1,150 calories, and 74 grams of fat. 317 minutes of walking, anyone? Carrot cake's healthy, right? Not at 1,560 calories and 84 grams of fat per slice. A cook at   recreated the Pasta Da Vinci, and came up with 3,736 calories and 165 grams of fat. The Weight Management California Salad, which has only -- only? -- 43 grams of fat. Read all about it in the article ""Calorie Pusher Comes To Town"" HERE'S THE REAL REASON TO STAY AWAY: The Cheesecake Factory is a charitable disaster. Speak to any development officer at charities in Denver and you'll find out the CF doesn't pump one dime, one in-kind gift certificate, one slice of fatty/fuffy/pasty cheesecake into Denver's active charitable community. BUT after the Breast Cancer Walk, the place is packed. Go figure. On the other hand, when Maggiano's moved into town, their PR machine cranked out letters to all the major charities letting them know when to submit their requests for participation, rules for sponsorship, and the amount of cash and in-kind participation available for the year. Maggiano's is a community-involvement powerhouse and has much better food. The kids at Cheesecake Factory are pleasant and hard working.

Christina H.,"Denver, CO",54,147,3,1.0,10/30/2009,I still think The Cheesecake Factory is awful! And I doubt I will ever return. But on re-reading my review I think my tone comes off overly aggressive and I sound like the kind of person who would be pissed off now matter how well you treated me. I have to reiterate that everything I wrote happened and that my girl-friend still huffs at the mere mention of The Cheesecake Factory. I just want to put it out there that I was very pleasant to the server/manager and all my anger was belated by shock. I think I'm a pretty pleasant person who is easy to please and late to complain but The Cheesecake Factory remains to this day the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=320

Perhaps I ate something prior that did it.  All I know is that if you puke up all of your dinner, chances are you won't want it ever again.  Sorry Cheesecake factory, if I ever go there again it won't be for a very very very long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=320

I ordered a nice big 22oz. beer for about $6, which was a pretty sweet deal. A friend ordered a delicious looking burger and another ordered some very nice looking cheesecake.

Raj R.,"Denver, CO",4,36,12,4.0,11/29/2007,"The Cheesecake Factory at Denver is extremely busy. So if you go on a weekend night be prepared to wait. It took us almost 30 minutes to get seated. But luckily its on the 16th street mall and so you can walk around as they provide you a pager. It might not look it from the outside but the restaurant is huge and goes pretty far into the back. So dont look for an intimate setting - the restaurant is very busy and so noisy too. The reason I liked this restaurant is that they have food for everyone. They have a few chinese dishes, american fare as well as italian. The prices on most dishes range from $15 to $20 and the portions are huge (you will most definetly have to take some back home). The waiters were nice, though a little busy and so running around a lot. But we never had to wait for a very long time. Finally, if you go to this restaurant, you must definetly have one of their cheesecakes. The Tiramisu cheescake is definetly awesome. These range in price from about $6.50 to $8.50). Again the slices and pretty big and you will most probably be taking some home. The alcohol was a little on the expensive side (a beer was $6.50) and so were their cocktails. On sundays, they are open for break-fast. I would definetly go there once again, but only as a group. Definetly not a romantic place for a couple. The desserts make it extremely kid friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=320

Lara W.,"Littleton, CO",12,55,22,2.0,10/18/2010,"In a town FULL of exceptional local eateries, it is simply a waste of time, money and tastebuds to eat here. I'm not a fan of chains for the exact reasons this place exemplifies! Overly large portions of butter and salt, a lack of creativity and maudlin servers who are only thinking of when their shift ends. Unfortunately, my daughter chose The CCF for her birthday lunch spot since her favorite restaurant was closed. Although she relished the monstrosity of a cheesecake slice she was given, I was unimpressed by the slow service and bored expression in our servers face, even when I asked if we could do something special for her birthday. My shrimp pasta dish was nearly coagulating in butter sauce and the shrimp were tough. The overly-descriptive and novel-esqe menu may promise great expectations...but it's all window dressing. The reality is that the food is mediocre and all this place seems to have going for it is it's prime people-watching location on 16th Street Mall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=320

Green Eyed G.,"Denver, CO",304,8,1,1.0,7/13/2010,"I have to start off by saying that I am always optimistic and ambitious when dining out. As one who is in the service industry in the downtown area, I know what to expect for the type of crowds at various places, and am always excited to support local business. Going to a corporate chain however, always leaves me with an experience I could have done without. This last visit was the perfect example of why I dislike anything corporate. It leaves very little to the imagination, and MUCH to be desired. I have always loved dessert here, and was excited to have my favorite chocolate tuxedo cheesecake. We started off here for a friends birthday dinner. She had called earlier in the day to reserve a table for 12, which they didn't do because ""we wouldn't need a reservation. Just come on in!"" This was just the beginning. We bellied up to a busy Thursday, and a 50 minute wait for a table. As we gathered round the bar, service was decent. I was unimpressed by the liquor selections and all I found was a list of over sugared concoctions, and even less to be admired with in the liquor department. A beer was sufficient. Our bartenders however, were pleasant and kept our group occupied and happy.  When we DID get our table, our waitress was pleasant, but did take 20 minutes to get just water on the table (1st priority in my book), and when I ordered a vodka press, had no clue what it was. Really???? Ok, so lack of knowledge doesn't make her a bad person, but in this industry, it's ALL about your service knowledge! So another 10 or so minutes goes by before cocktails hit the table, and sadly enough some drinks were even forgotten. When we tell her that we want separate checks to avoid a hassle later, she says she will split them later (Oh, boy). So we finally ordered, (after reading our novel of a menu), and all seems to be picking up. What saddened me is the amount of staff running amok, looking miserable, and clearly not doing much for one another. Even the obvious floor manager passed our table with empty waters, bread baskets and cocktail glasses without as much as a 2nd thought or offering to help his staff in clearing as something as simple as an empty glass or 2. When our food did finally arrive, it literally came out 2 plates at a time, since our waitress clearly had not much support staff to back her up, save for the one gentleman who helped her with 2 plates. I wish I had our server's name, because she was nice, but really...after waiting almost an hour for our table, and waiting for things to pick up to a relatively decent pace, things just never got past so-so. When I went to make change at the bar to pay my bill, another server was more perceptive in the 1 minute at the bar, than any other service we had all night. If I had thought that the manger seemed concerned, I may have asked to speak with him. Oh and adding 18 % gratuity to a table that you give virtually no service to, hardly constitutes as acceptable. Had you given proper service and attention to begin with, you would have received a hell of a lot more from a group who eats, sleeps and breathes in Denver's nightlife. Thanks for bagging our food to go, but with portions like that, it's probably pretty routine. Long story short, spending 3 hours here just to get over-sized portions of mediocre food, left none of us wanting dessert, which was the main reason we came in the 1st place. I'm pretty sure that unless I get cheesecake to go, or have to attend another event here, I won't be spending any more time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-denver?start=340
