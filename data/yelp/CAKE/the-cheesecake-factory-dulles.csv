Olivia M.,"Herndon, VA",0,13,215,4.0,11/30/2017,"My second visit to an outlet from the Cheesecake Factory chain and it was as good as the first except for the service again. Too many guests and not enough servers. Food and cheesecake however is the highlight of the visit every time. We ordered chicken samosa - sort of an Indian appetiser. Wheat flour , deep fried (triangle shaped) wrapped minced chicken mixed with spices. Filling was a bit dry. chicken burger - served with yummy French fries the burger was absolutely delicious and quite filling. Shrimp scampi - Succulent fresh juicy Prawns  cooked to perfection sautéed in lemon  and garlic butter  served with Angel  hair pasta  and asparagus  The Chef who invented this tantalising combination gets a big hug from me . Moreover this was from the skinilicious menu, only 590 calories  Dessert - Chocolate truffle cake  wow  this was so Chocolatey and delicious  a must have for all chocolate lovers  chocolate  Our server was warm and good with suggestions but since the restaurant was crowded he wasn't able to give us a lot of attention. Prices are a bit high. But food quality makes up for it. Waiting to visit my next Cheesecake Factory outlet to explore even more from the amazing dishes on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles
Billy L.,"Falls Church, VA",19,36,12,1.0,12/19/2017,"I've been here a few times a while back & never had any issues. Recently though, I went with my wife & son and the service was a disaster. After being seated & waiting for about 10 minutes with NO ONE greeting us despite multiple servers walking by, so I took it upon myself to go to the bar to get everyone drinks. Finally, our sever comes over. I've worked in restaurants/bars for over a decade & I know that things happen, so I'm expecting an apology and/or explanation as to why we had to wait so long & run our own drinks. Nope. A quick, listless hello & ""Are you ready to order?"" was our greeting. Alrighty, then. We order, have to ask a DIFFERENT server for some bread since our server was nowhere to be found, get our bread, & a runner brings the app. When our entree comes, my wife's dish was missing a sauce. After waiting for a few minutes with the server again nowhere to be found, I went to the host stand to see about correcting our order. Finally, as we're finishing our meal, the server comes over to see how everything is going. I'm pissed at this point, so I just say ""fine"" to move things along so we can leave. I figured my critiques would fall on deaf ears, so I'll fill out the survey later.  Skip ahead a few days later, post-survey, I get an email from the GM, Shawn, which is a nice, quick response. He apologized for the problems we had, offered a gift card, & even called me to discuss and get details on our visit. We chat for a bit, I give my two cents on things, & we end the call. A few weeks later, it dawns on me that I never received a gift card, so I send Shawn an email inquiring about it. I felt weird doing it as I didn't want to appear to be complaining to try and get something for free, but the feeling of being slighted overwhelmed that weirdness. He replied back that the gift card will be ""mailed from our corporate headquarters in Calabasas, California. Usually takes 5-10 business days"". THAT reply was a couple of weeks ago, so I'm doubtful I'll see it. That weirdness I was talking about earlier makes it awkward to broach the subject with him AGAIN, so I figured I'd vent my frustrations here.  TL;DR - Good food, crap service. Oblivious server & zero attempt made at recovery. General Manager didn't follow thru on promise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles
Britt D.,"Fairfax, VA",151,187,363,1.0,9/6/2017,"Worst experience ever.  I ordered a few sugar free cheesecakes for pick up and waited for about 10mins in the 'To go' area. It was so crowded loud, and the employees behind the counter could have cared less. If I wasn't getting these for someone, I would have left but I waited to be greeted.  Finally someone looks up and helps me, br co to use on with their task for another 5minutes before I get the cheesecake I had already ordered.  Upon return to the house there was a fly. a FLY on the cheesecake. I wasn't going to drive back there because I was treated so poorly. Horrible quality control.  I'll never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles

Judy L.,"Washington, DC",189,347,1820,4.0,7/30/2017,"I frequent this Cheesecake Factory the most. The service is consistently quick and the food is always delicious, and BIG of course! There always seem to be a wait when we come for dinner and lunch. But we usually don't wait more than 25 minutes and our servers are pretty good. We had limited dining time this past visit as we were in a hurry to the airport afterwards. Our server was very mindful and made sure our food arrived to the table at a reasonable amount of time. She also took initiative to package our cheesecakes ahead of time.  The Cheesecake Factory was one of those chains that I dined at back in college. It's burgers, pizza, salads, pastas, entrees, fusion foods, and cheesecake at reasonable prices with huge portions for now and for later. We eat here now because the food is still delicious and there's a little bit of something for everyone. My husband likes to bring his coworkers from Mexico and Europe here. The Cheesecake Factory is a sensation in other countries and what's more American than burgers, pizzas, fusion foods, and once again, huge portion sizes!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles
Ruth G.,"Broadlands, VA",207,77,49,5.0,8/8/2017,This Cheesecake Factory is located at Dulles Mall. It's pretty good and upholds their standard like at all other locations. The ambiance is always nice and the staff are friendly and accommodating. I went here with my brother and his niece. The server was really nice and funny. My niece laughed at his jokes.  The food was good. I ordered the Southwestern Grilled Chicken Sandwich with a side salad. My niece had the Kids Cheese Pizza. My brother had some Mexican Corn Tortilla Salad (don't quote me on that title). And of course we had shared a slice of Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. Oh myyy gosshhh Cheesecake is just so good..!

Wes M.,"San Jose, CA",603,484,1625,3.0,12/27/2016,"I know it's shortly after Christmas, but Cheesecake Factory was severely understaffed. How understaffed, you ask? There are close to a dozen open tables, but the wait is still 30 minutes because they don't have enough waiters to go around. Management needs to figure out what it's doing. Regarding the food, the sweet potato fries weren't bad. The cheesecake is also good, but very overpriced. $7-8 for a slice? I would also live more actual cheesecake, than soft cake. The Reese's PB Cup cheesecake I got have very thin layers on cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles
Eddie B.,"Ashburn, VA",88,77,1362,5.0,10/17/2017,"We absolutely love the happy hour here. It's only at the bar area which has high top tables a few regular tables. The servers are usually friendly. The happy hour includes 2 or 3 draft beer options for about $4. They bring out a bread basket of tasty white and dark bread. The happy hour food menu is one of the best ones around when it comes to options. There a quite a few things you can order for a very good price between $5 and $8. Some of these item include guacamole, spinach dip, southwest egg rolls, mini chicken sandwiches, tuna tartar, foot long hot dog, hamburger, chicken lettuce wraps, pot stickers, flat breads, fried Mac and cheese balls and more. You can add fries to the burger and hot dog for like an additional $2 and it's totally worth it. Everything tastes very good. We always have a good experience here for a fairly good price. The cheesecake is not on the happy hour menu and is about $8 but it's delicious. It's one of the tastiest cheesecakes you can get around here. The whole cheesecake menu is huge and very creative.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles
Katelyn H.,"Inwood, WV",79,82,92,1.0,5/22/2017,"What is worse waiting 30 minutes for your drink or an hour for your check?  I should've read other reviews before coming in here, I know..my mistake. The hostesses wasn't very welcoming or friendly sadly but I easily over looked that because she wouldn't be the one serving us.  Once we got seated a woman took our drink order - strawberry lemonade & a sprite. About 10 minutes go by, no drink, no waitress, but yet a different girl comes up and asks for our drink order.. okay ""Strawberry Lemonade & Sprite"" again. We finally got our drinks and the first girl, she finally took our order. We got cheesy garlic bread, Caesar salad, & two lunch pasta dishes.  Now, we wait again. 20 minutes go by we finally get our appetizer and salad. Our waitress didn't even bring it out, it was yet again a different girl. By this time we've had 3 different waitresses.  We also got bread with our meal which wasn't very good at all. The best part was the cheesy garlic bread. About 10-15 minutes after our appetizer, our main meal finally came out. Meanwhile the people beside us who got there after us had already ate and left. The food wasn't anything to brag about. I got the four cheese pasta. It was honestly kind of bland and lacked salt. I also wasn't a fan of the huge ball of ricotta cheese just slapped in the middle. It wasn't very appetizing. The pasta was cooked well though I thought, it wasn't too mushy like a lot of places cook their pasta.  Once we were done eating my husband wanted a box for his so the other girl who wasn't our waitress came by and asked if we needed a box & I also told her to get our check. We had already been waiting 20 minutes for our original waitress to bring our check at that point. Our original waitress comes back and says I'll get you a box & the check. I told her someone else already went to get it. She rolled her eyes and said well I will get it too just in case. The other girl came back with a box & the check. Then right after, our original waitress came and acted surprised we got the box and check. Like HELLO we just told you someone else was getting it. She rolled her eyes and walked away. Not even a have a good day, nothing.  Needless to say we paid with cash because we weren't waiting for another 30 minutes to get our card back. I don't understand the hype for this place. I definitely didn't enjoy having 3 different people acting as our waitress. It wasn't worth all that waiting either. This place is not that great and we won't ever be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles

I expect the cheesecake to be amazing (and it is), the food, my expectations aren't so high because after all they are the CHEESCAKE factory. However, the Jamaican blacken shrimp dish is delicious. Just the right amount of spicy (I don't do spicy). The plantains were sweet, the black beans were..ok. But the chicken and shrimp were really good. The food came in a decent amount of time and the waiter was knowledgeable and nice. Would I go there again. A resounding yes.

Lauren M.,"Frederick, MD",43,124,81,2.0,1/10/2017,"Oh, dear! Cheesecake Factory, I want to love you! I visited this location after work with a few friends. We were promptly seated, provided with water and bread, then it all went down hill from there. The service was inexcusably slow. We waited what felt like for-ev-er for our orders to be taken and then forever-and-a-half for them to arrive. I ordered the crabcake sandwich with fries and a mint cucumber lemonade. The mint cucumber lemonade was wonderful. So much so that I bought the ingredients to recreate it at home. The crabcake, however, was under cooked - basically a pile of crabby goo. I would've said something to our waiter, if we would've actually seen him. I ate a few nibbles and called it quits because I knew we didn't have enough time for them to redo it (and I didn't want a stomach ache). Yay for bread and fries for dinner! I don't even think it was the waiters fault, as the restaurant seemed severely understaffed. We gave ourselves a little over an hour and a half to eat before our evening activity (paint night nearby) and ended up having to rush to finish our meals and get the check. Once the checks arrived, they were almost all wrong! To save time, we worked it out among ourselves.  It was overall a very poor experience and I would expect better given the Cheesecake Factory's reputation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles

The service is always great, and they are always so helpful when I can't decide what to get. The calamari is absolutely delicious! I love the aioli and marinara sauce that comes with it. The batter isn't too heavy, or overly oily. My family and I get it every time. The Seared Tuna Tataki Salad is AMAZING! The perfectly seared tuna, arugula, avocado, slices of fresh tomatoes, and dressing all go together perfectly. It's extremely addicting. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta is always on point! The sauce has just enough spice and creamy-ness to make this dish irresistible.

Diana S.,"Tucson, AZ",8,33,19,2.0,2/7/2017,"First off let me start by saying I love Cheesecake Factory. However the one in Dulles has 3 times now been disappointing! First visit my salmon was ""burnt"" so they had to remake it. We were on our way to work and don't get to eat our food because it took so long. Manager did say sorry and brought us the new one. We were just beside ourselves like it was no big deal. Sidebar- they weren't busy. Oh well can't win em all.  Next time I was by myself came to bar and had stuffed mushrooms (Delish) and 2 drinks. The bartender a light skinned guy with long braids was bar tending. He seemed less than interested in serving me or the other patrons aside from two younger people who he clearly knew. My thought was what bartender has this much attitude with out even talking to you. I asked for check and left without finishing my second drink. Tonight I am sitting here and the same bartender is here. I walk up and the bar is cluttered with empty glasses and trash. I go to the further end and ask if the seats are open, he states no I think they went outside. Now the signed CC slip and the empty glasses told a different story. So I squeeze oddly between two young men  and another woman sitting by herself. Needless to say the seat I wanted was empty no one ever came back and sat. Back to story. He asks what I want to drink. I get a tea he sets it down and walks off. Just an attitude like I am lucky he is serving me. Never offers me a menu. So luckily I wanted my foto miso salmon. So as he ignores me more. I finally say excuse me may I order the miso salmon. It comes he never asks how it was. The brown rice was undercooked. It made me sad 2 times now I came in for my favorite dish and 2 times I didn't eat. I say may I get this boxed up and he says I can give you a box. So I packed up my salmon and began to write this post. Who ever this bartender is he should learn that a job in customer service means you have to offer customer service... talk to your customers... smile.. if he is too talented for this position maybe he should move on instead of making my dinner unenjoyable. I think I will stick to the fairfax location as they have never let me down... sorry folks but if you are looking for the consistent delicious Cheesecake Factory you are used to don't go to the one at Dulles mall....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=40
Julie H.,"Reston, VA",133,99,384,3.0,1/14/2016,"I like Cheesecake Factory but this location isn't as good as the one located in Tyson galleria mall. The service is decent, they take your order, bring your food, checks up on the customers needs maybe once and after that you gotta look for them for anything else you need and to get you bill. Because of the food I give them three stars...if the food was good as the tysons location I'd give at least four stars. My favorite is chicken bellagio. But every time I order at this location, it's either really salty or pretty bland. Portion is always same which ever Cheesecake Factory location you go to. Chicken enchiladas was ok too.  Most disappointing entree was shepherds pie. It was so salty. Another dish that was disappointing was their orange chicken. I was hoping it'd be more crispy with tangy sweet spicy sauce. But it was bland and slightly soggy. I've ordered avocado eggrolls, which was ok. Not as crispy as it should be.

When the drinks came, the waitress set my boyfriend's beer down on a plate causing it to fall over and break the glass. Glass and beer went everywhere, including all over my jeans. The waitress asked if she did that, attempting to take the blame away from her, but barely apologized. She offered to move us to a different table, but for whatever reason, she made us wait for a table to be cleaned when there was an open one right next to it. We sit down and she asks if we need more silverware...we had used the napkins to try to wipe down the beer and she asked after everything had been already cleared from the table we left...so unless we plan on eating with our hands, yes we do. We waited several minutes, but she did not come check on us or bring over bread. I got the attention of the manager and told him what had happened. I said that we are waiting on our bread and I would like them to take care of the cost of the beer considering I was wearing it. He said he would take care of it. As I expected, the bread came out seconds before the food. I hadn't even buttered my piece before having to make room for my plate. The waitress wasn't attentive, even after spilling beer all over me. The bill came and the beer was on there.

Amanda G.,"Herndon, VA",219,279,8,2.0,5/31/2016,"Not a fan of that ridiculously large menu. For someone who has a hard time making decisions, it's very daunting.  Our waiter was strange...he had a VERY sharp, brusque personality that could have been almost joking, but nobody thought he was. He gave an air of pure impatience and annoyance, each time he spoke to us we were left speechless with his demeanor, not sure if he was making jabs at us or if that's just the way he is. It made me feel pressured into making a decision and I made some that I sincerely regret. I would have had a much better review to write if it weren't for his attitude...we thought about asking to be moved to a different section but we really loved the seat we ended up in so we thought we could deal with it. I regret not moving. Drinks: I got the Pineapple Moscow Mule which for some odd reason came in a large glass instead of a mule mug, and it was watered down by all the ice within mere minutes and I had to chug it to get my money's worth. It was tasty but would have been much tastier with an actual mule mug, if you don't want to spend the money on the right drinkware don't offer the drink! They also don't list the prices of their drinks which I'm not a fan of.  Food: For an appetizer I chose potstickers (a rushed decision because I felt I was taking up our waiters time) and they were mediocre at best. My friends liked them but I was not impressed. They got some kind of avocado egg roll which was really a guacamole egg roll, they enjoyed it but I thought it was too much. We came in seeking brunch which they did not offer on a Monday, I kind of figured that would happen, but found it odd that they didn't just include the brunch menu items with their breakfast menu since they already offer a ridiculous amount of dishes. Their breakfast menu was almost all omelettes and a sandwich, which I got (again, not really in the mood for it but the waiter was putting the pressure on for me to decide) and it was a big waste. The sandwich tasted fine but it was ENORMOUS (I learned all of their dishes are extremely over portioned) and I took two bites before just giving up. It was just not what I wanted and was terrified of asking for something else because of our waiter's extreme personality. It was partially my fault for not having the, er, gumption to ask for more time to make a decision but the times he did come back he would say something to the extent of ""did you FINALLY decide on something??"" how can you expect anyone to make a snappy decision on a menu with hundreds of choices?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=40

Perhaps it is the friendly service behind the bar, or the yummy $5 dollar appetizers that make you forget they serve cheesecake, but whatever the reason, I'm down with this cheesecake castle. Yeah, that's right, I'm going to rename this one the castle, because every time we come here, I feel like they give us the royal treatment. Another thing I love about their appetizers is that just a few plates can make a pretty tasty meal for two people; A plate of Cuban egg rolls and fried calamari and you're good for the day.

As for their cheesecake, it's stellar, you could probably talk me into buying a single piece for $15. I wish the Cheesecake Factory only sold cheesecake and did away with the rest of the menu. Maybe they can keep their appetizers, but their novel of a menu could definitely be downsized quite a bit. I know I've said this before, but this time I really mean it.

Today I had the Skinnylicous chopped salad.  It's always a good standby salad for me.  Has some chicken, apples, bleu cheese and chopped lettuce and veggies with a tasty dressing.  Most of their salads are good.  I recommend asking for the dressing on the side.  They tend to overdress their salads.   They are usually okay with special requests - one in our party picked off certain ingredients of her salad and added others from another she saw she liked and they were happy to accommodate so don't hesitate to ask for what you really want if you don't see it on the menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=40

Susan H.,"Reston, VA",452,634,1111,2.0,12/28/2015,"We went to the mall to shop the after Christmas sales.  Before going, I asked my husband where he wanted to eat.  He said, ""The Cheesecake Factory"".  This was a surprise considering our recent visit to the one in the Tysons Galeria was a rather lackluster experience.  He explained that he wanted to have a turkey club sandwich and when we went to the Tysons one, they didn't have any turkey but figured they would have it here. We were there shortly after 5 p.m. on a Sunday.  The place was busy but there were still empty tables.  We were lead to a booth by the friendly hostess.  Our server came along shortly, before we even had time to look at the menu.  We asked her to come back in a bit.  When she came back, I gave my food and drink order.  I ordered a glass of lemonade plus ""Renee's special"" which consists of: 1/2 sandwich, salad and soup.  The soup of the day (and the only soup they have) was sweet chicken soup. So far, so good...then my husband ordered.  He ordered a glass of Yuengling and a turkey club.  They didn't have any turkey.  I asked the server why that was and mentioned how Tysons didn't have it either.  She said they hadn't had any turkey in a long time because there was a turkey shortage.  Then I asked her why they didn't remove turkey items from the menu or at least clip a note to the menu.  She said because they expect to have it again at some point.  My husband then told her that he would need more time to pick out something else. Meanwhile, we figured that we, at least, would get our drinks...but no.  People who came in after us were getting their drinks.  The server came back to take my husband's food order.  He ordered the old fashioned burger and didn't want a side with it. Then the server made herself scarce---still no drinks.  Finally, I caught her eye and asked about the drinks.  She apologized and blamed the bartender (really?)  but she then got the drinks It took less time to get our food to us.  My husband was served a burger and a roll with no toppings.  He asked the food runner about that and the runner offered to bring him some lettuce, tomato and onion.  That came quickly but instead of lettuce, there was shredded cabbage. My dinner was okay.  The 1/2 sandwich was chicken salad with almonds.  the salad was mixed greens dressed in a vinaigrette.  The sweet chicken soup wasn't too bad as it was creamy with a generous amount of chicken in it.  The lemonade was actually good---more on the sweet side and with a sugared rim on the glass. The whole experience left us feeling annoyed.   If they don't have any turkey items at any Cheesecake Factory, at least fix the menu in some way to reflect that.   As we were leaving, my husband said to me, ""Remind me to never go here again.""  I most certainly will do that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=20

Always had refills for us in hand, kept our to go cheesecake in the fridge until we checked out and boxed my food for me. I hope management figures the scheduling out because it was obvious to me as a server that they were not expecting a rush.

We went straight to the cheesecake counter and were greeted nicely by one of the employees. The questions we had at the time were answered with great pleasure by this employee.  Then when we went to check out with the cashier, Lan Chi L, my wife had another question. ""What are all the new cheesecakes?"" This question was answered in a hurry and not completely answered, followed by a rude ""are you ready?"" Once we ordered one cheesecake, we felt rushed by Lan Chi L, although there was no line. We also had a family member from out of the country with us and we wanted him to get a cheesecake. We ended up ordering 6 cheesecakes and then were told they all would not be half price. Only one per person. Because we were unaware of that we decided to order one cheesecake each. We were all rushed to order and were asked if that was all, after each item we ordered. Not great customer service.  Lan Chi L clearly did not want to be at work this morning, but she did not need to be rude to us.

It can be a bit pricey but they give very generous portions. I always leave with a doggy bag; enough for a full lunch the next day.  We never usually order appetizers because we get trashed off of the honey-wheat bread they bring out and by the time the food comes I can only eat like 4 bites, then it's in the doggy bag. This time we ordered the Thai lettuce wraps. They were pretty delicious. It comes with julienned carrots, beans sprouts, grilled chicken (which honestly they could've given us a little more of for 3 people), noodles, and three different sauces: Thai chili, which was sweet but missing the spicy. A green sauce which was sweeter than the thai chili sauce and peanut sauce. The wraps were very good and a light appetizer to start off with.  I ended up getting my usual, BBQ salmon. The salmon is always juicy and the amount of sauce they put on it is just right. It comes with a side of corn succotash but I always swap that out with steamed broccoli. Nom! The roasted red potatoes and thin crispy red onion straws just complete the dish.

The chicken in hubby's burrito was tough.  As for my meal... Let's start with the steak. I ate a small piece and thought it tasted weird. I figured maybe it was the sauce. I asked hubby to try a small piece. He spit it out and said it was spoiled. So, I spit out the second small piece I just put in my mouth. The salmon came with mashed potato and asparagus which were actually okay except that they were cold.  Our server came to our table and asked us how our meals are. We told him about the steak. He went to get his manager.  The manager came and he took my plate away with the spoiled steak. We decided to just go with the Herb Salmon when he asked us if I wanted the same dish. He said he'll get me a fresh order of the Herb Salmon.  My husband decided not to say anything about his burrito. He probably ate not even a quarter of the the whole thing. The chicken was that tough for him.  They finally came back with my salmon. I wasn't a big fan of the lemony sauce that came with it. We ended up just taking our food home. We ordered our cheesecakes to go, which they gave us for free.  Hubby ended up throwing the leftover burrito the next day.   It's nice that they have a huge variety of dishes but if you're starving, you better know what you want before you go there otherwise, you'll get a headache from hunger trying to figure what to order from their novel-like menu.  Their cheesecakes are always great. After this experience, I think I'll stick with the cheesecake again next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=100

Sean P.,"Ashburn, VA",70,180,65,4.0,7/30/2014,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory (even if I never really get Cheesecake). It's not perfect, but it's always reliable and there's definitely something for everyone on the menu. Speaking of menus, that's exactly the strength and weakness of the Factory. There literally IS something for everyone, but there are so many menu options, choices, variations and choices that if you're even remotely decisive you may ultimately have an aneurism just trying to figure out what you want. Not only that, but every other page in the menu is an ad. What's with that? I'm looking for food, not perfume. Stop that! Further, I don't want to ""accessorize"" my meal with Diet Coke. The wording is very irksome to me for some reason, BUT that's a pet peeve/personal issue. How's the food? Great! Love it. The food is solid, and I've never had anything bad there. I think my favorite dish is the chicken and biscuits. It's massively feeling (and very rich) but I love sharing it with my wife. The flat breads are pretty good, too. The pasta carbonara is also a favorite of mine, too. Again, it's a heartstopper and rich as can be, but delicious! There's so many amazing options that trying to pick one is (again) half the problem. And yes, the cheesecake IS good (though I rarely get it). The portion sizes are so large for main courses that, between the bread, apps and main course I barely make it half way through the meal before I start getting full. All in all: It's pretty good. I'd give it four stars, but the overwhelming menu and the constant advertising is really distracting/frustrating for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=100
Maria M.,"Herndon, VA",0,2,,1.0,10/12/2014,"Waiting to be seated: Terrible service. My boyfriend and I, in a group of 20 people, came here for homecoming dinner. Granted the size of our group, and the fact that we WERE NOT allowed to book reservations, we were told there was about an hour wait, just outside the restaurant. It wouldn't have been so bad being that we were with our dates and could take pictures, but it was 2-1/2 HOURS before we were seated! Noisy atmosphere, sluggish service: The atmosphere was faux-classy. Very noisy and crowded and busy. Our orders were taken as quickly as one could expect for 20 people I suppose, but it was still slow. We waited an hour for our food, I'm not sure if that's normal for them or not. It came in generously large portions on nice platters, I'll give them that. Very sweet food! (Not in the good way): I ordered the cashew chicken, thinking it would be spicy as stated, but it wasn't at all! It may be that I'm used to spice, but I think even someone with mild taste would not find it spicy. Much less ""very spicy"" as described in their menu. It was more sweet than anything but it wasn't ""bad"", just not my preference. I couldn't finish the portion even on an empty stomach and I didn't box it up. My boyfriend ordered teriyaki which was even sweeter! Seems to me there is an odd pattern in their menu. Neither of us were ecstatic about our meals. Even MORE waiting!! I think this was the worse part. The service only continued to slow down. my boyfriend and I waited for the check for at least half an hour, waited for it to be collected for another 20 minutes, and he didn't receive back his card and receipt for another hour! This was notorious. I had other things I wanted to do with my night. Even among friends I was growing antsy. It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to pay a bill! In conclusion: We were there for a total of FIVE HOURS! At least three and a half of those were from unnecessary waiting alone! I understand 20 people is a lot but that gives no excuse for their slow slow slow service. We could've at least been given a discount or something. And the food wasn't good enough to be waiting that long. I will not be returning to this location any time soon, or at least not with as many people. Granted I would like to try a couple more menu items, I may be retesting their serving skills after a year or so. One more waiting session or sweet meal and I'm done.

Their menu is huge, so almost everyone can find something.  Pizza, Salads, Sandwiches, Burgers, Pasta, desserts, chicken and fish dishes...its a good casual place to go when you're hungry especially when you aren't sure what exactly you want.   The Sterling location meets the same standards as other Cheesecake Factories. The only complaint I have about Cheesecake Factory is that their tables are soooo close together, its a bit awkward.  (they all are like this, this location is nothing different)   I had the ahi tuna appetizer and arugula salad for dinner the other night. The tuna tasted a bit too fishy, but otherwise was good.  The boyfriend almost always gets the chicken parmesan sandwich, so I'm guessing its a winner!   Decent, large menu, you can always find something to eat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=100

But here's a dirty little secret it's critics are too proud to admit. THE FOOD IS GOOD. The kitchen at Cheesecake Factory can sometimes be slow. But that's good. It's slow because they're making real food back there. This is not Applebee's, or Olive Garden, where most dishes are produced in a factory (pardon the pun) and reconstituted upon your request.

Sharar P.,"Sterling, VA",146,1,,1.0,6/13/2017,"***DO NOT EAT HERE*** *May 28th* my birthday! My best friend brought me to cheesecake for lunch. I honestly wish after the both of us being hospitalized for server food poisoning we would have just gone to McDonald's!  When we walked in the host were anything BUT pleasant. Also their clothing was a bit much it's not a night club.  Our waitress was an older woman who talked so much she forgot to put my order in! The appetizer (pot stickers) we got were terrible! 20 mins go by and my friends food comes out. Then 10 more minutes go by and the waitress comes over and asked how everything was... then quickly notice she didn't put my food in.  All I ordered was grilled chicken, broccoli , and mash potatoes! Another 10 mins go by and she ask if carrots are okay instead of broccoli, which shows she clearly didn't attend/pay attention to their pre-shift. I also had a Cesar salad that just tasted like romaine tossed with water.  My food finally comes out! The chicken is burnt on the outside but one taste and it was clear it was STILL RAW! The mash potatoes were cold and the carrots were hot but lacked flavor. Lastly our server had an attitude when my friend asked for a birthday dessert for me. We then ask for to-go cups and get plastic ramekins  I felt like I was being punked  At this point we're annoyed with the serves and the food was garbage! We express this to the sever and she gets a manager to comp my friends salad. We thought maybe the manager would have come by the table but no one ever did.  After we paid the server NEVER returned. We were trying to get to-go cups so we asked the host, who told us to go to the pastry counter to ask for cups.  We go there and the cashier had such a nasty attitude, she slammed 2 plastic cups down without lids. Clearly we had asked for to-go cups but she was bothered.  We finally locate a manager who said that she had just walked in at 4 but the funny thing is we saw her on the patio talking to serves when we walked by to come in (90mins prior) We expressed our issues and all we got was an ""I'm sorry""  On the 30th I woke up at 2am vomiting and had a fever of 103 I was so weak to the point my husband had to pick me up and carry me to the car and get help moving my body once at the ER! I'm 5 months pregnant and it was terrifying to be that sick and not being able to eat for days to nourish my baby broke my heart!  I contacted my friend to see how she was and she told me she had just been released from the hospital because she had food poisoning!  So I call a few days later to inform the managers and I got yet again another attitude, the female manager said ""well no one else got sick so"" and I told her I have the paperwork from the hospital and so does my friend. I was told corporate would be calling us within 24 hours and now it's June 14!  I've been a server/bartender for years and I've never seen such horrible customer service from the host all the way to the manager!

They have a lighter menu which I've experienced and have not been disappointed with yet but come on...the other foods are too dang yummy to choose healthier all the time.

I didn't see the tab because hubby always takes care of me but I can only imagine what the bill was.  Our bartender was super nice and attentive.

Being new ish vegans were not really sure about who serves what and how the heck you're supposed to eat out when everything seems to be smothered in cheese or butter. Turns out this place could very well be vegan paradise. At first glance we had our choice of basically 6 salads- sans cheese and croutons. But on closer look- this menu is super easy to navigate and lots of leave the meat off options are available. We got the flatbread with basil and tomato no cheese for an app, it was small but delicious. The fresh table bread came with butter which our waitress happily subbed with olive oil- for lunch I went with the vegan salad, cliche but delicious and so huge I couldn't finish it it had asparagus, cooked radish, lettuce quinoa, spinach, sunflower seeds cashews- oh lord it was a mountain of nuts and veggies drowning in some delicious house balsamic vinaigrette that was so good you could wipe it on your face and not be mad! - So the fries we ordered were awesome but the meals were so big they're coming home with us! Ok so, hub ordered the veggie burger which was suspect we weren't sure about the egg dilemma on this one- it's clean! No egg! It was FREAKIN HUGE!

I mean I have been to this place well over ten times since moving to the NOVA area. What I like most about this place is that they are pretty consistent. There has only been two or three occasions where my wife and I didn't have the normal standards that we are accustomed to during our many visits. However this wasn't as bad as most places because the service and management are willing to do whatever they can to resolve any issue with our respective meals. For instance they would either subtract that meal item from our bill or prepare a fresh order. I have tried many different food items here but a majority of my visits I find myself defaulting to the Famous Factory Meatloaf which is hmmmmm hmmmm good. Also just a heads up for you health conscious folks that the portions are huge so be sure to pay attention to what you're ordering.  However on this particular occasion I decided to be a bit more healthy so I ordered from their skinnylicious menu. I ended up ordering the Skinnylicious Grilled Salmon with assorted vegetables and let me just say that I enjoyed every bit of the meal. The Cheesecake Factory is always a choice I can default to if nothing else comes to mind.

If I wanted a burger that tasted like packed grains, which I don't, I'd probably just make my own. Most vegetarians and vegans don't eat meat for the animals sake. We'd like our veggie burgers to approximate a real burger experience. This didn't. The hubby's fries were very good. He said his burger was average. I really like the atmosphere.

The atmosphere is like any other cheesecake factory, fancy-ish, dark lighting (supposed to be mood lighting? who knows), and staff dressed in white shirts and black dress pants. If you're looking for a place with a lot of cheesecake some here. I usually never get dinner here because of the price of the entrees and the amount of food you get (is simply too much if you ask me especially if you want dessert) and if I had to choose I would get cheesecake.

Joshua D.,"Sterling, VA",150,655,71,2.0,4/16/2014,"I used to think Cheesecake Factory was the bombdiggity, but over the years, it's certainly lost its luster. Yet, despite being a mid-tier chain restaurant that doesn't specialize in anything, CF tries to act like a super-classy hotspot for cuisine. In reality, it's become not much more than a place known for an OK happy hour and oversized portions. Don't get me wrong, there are certain dishes I find really good -- such as CF's orange chicken. But it's not worth dealing with the CF 'experience' for when several actual Chinese places do it better and cheaper. And of course, the main event, the cheesecake, is amazing -- but that's a once-a-year treat no one's waistline dares have regularly. On my most recent visit to the Dulles location, I was instantly annoyed. Despite half the restaurant being open (it was a Tuesday night after happy hour for crying out loud), the hostess quoted a 10-minute wait. is that supposed to make CF seem fancier? Because instead it just makes it annoying and inefficient. At least hide the empty tables from my view. Don't have enough people to staff them? At least let me go ahead and sit down with some bread and a Coke. (Oh, and plan better.) The service was fine. The food was fine. I'd never had pizza from CF (have had just about everything else and wanted to mix it up). The pizza reminded me of a DiGiorno. The crust seemed to indicated a previously frozen dough, and the cheese and sauce had that cafeteria-quality flavor. The toppings varied slightly from what was in the menu description, and the mushrooms and veggies were seriously underrepresented. The meats, however - pepperoni and sausage -- were piled high. I could almost give CF three stars, but it really does fall more often than not these days in the, ""Meh. I've experienced better."" category.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=80

Megan C.,"Herndon, VA",532,659,554,4.0,3/5/2014,"I'm loath to reward a ""big chain"" like Cheesecake Factory with a full 4 stars, more details on that to come, so let's just settle at 3.5 and call it a draw.  Location-wise, this particular copy is great. It's convenient to all things related to Dulles Town Center and Sterling, with tons of easy mall parking, and it's standalone, so you don't have to deal with the throng of people inside the mall itself. We've always experienced friendly, efficient, and accurate service here, which is much more than I can say for the Fair Oaks and Tyson's Corner locations. On our last visit, during one of the many ""polar vortex"" nights of 2014, when most restaurants were closing doors early, CF remained open, and even though they were short-staffed, our waitress, Amy, was great.  For those who have a geographic choice as we do in selecting among the Dulles/Fair Oaks/Tyson's locations, we always choose Dulles, especially on the weekends. They just seem to run a tighter ship here all-around, and waiting times are either non-existent or shorter than other nearby locations. Helpful to know if you run with a ""hangry"" bunch during weekend meal times. That's ""hungry""+""angry"", FYI :) Okay, so more detail on my ""beef"" with Cheesecake Factory as a whole, if you're still reading (since we've gone over the nuts and bolts of this particular location). In 2014, it blows my mind that there is still a chain restaurant that REFUSES to publish their ingredients and nutritional information. That irks the hell out of me, as an 80%-of-the-time very health-conscious eater and having a member of my family with an allergy to a certain ingredient, it's irritating to say the least. We want to enjoy CF, as their food is pretty tasty, prices fair, and menu expansive, but it's almost as though they have ""something to hide"" in not disclosing their full modus operandi.  I realize they offer the (deceptively) ""Skinnylicious"" menu, but only offer that the items are ""under XYZ calories,"" but what about fat/carbs/sodium/etc.? They would probably attract even more folks such as myself who would seek out a special ""healthy"" menu if they were to disclose ingredients, portion sizes, and full nutritionals. Okay, rant over. I remember eating at CF for pre-Prom dinner one year in high school, and although my days of carelessly indulging in their cheesecake are over, I do enjoy their breakfast/brunch items and salads, especially the Tuna Tataki Salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=80

However, I would give 2 stars to the service. Although the service was responsive, my group's waitress was especially rude.

Our waitress was very unfriendly. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day, but her greeting had no eye contact or smile. She was sick of us before she even took our order. We ordered two alcoholic beverages, which took way too long to come to the table. We also ordered an appetizer that took 20 minutes to get. Our waitress said she ""is not sure what is going on with with kitchen today"" but she let her manager know that we had to wait  too long for a single appetizer. The appetizer was good (chicken potstickers); however, I cannot say the same for my Salmon Salad. The salad was grossly overdressed and the salmon was in one huge chunk slapped on top. Not very appealing. When our entrees came we requested from the food runner that we get some bread (our waitress never brought us any). He said enthusiastically ""Sure! No problem!"" He was never to be seen again. We would have asked our waitress, but we didn't see her again until after we finished our meal (at which point she filled our empty water glasses with warm water). We noticed that the tables around us were also getting poor service. The table next to us had to order another round of drinks because their first round of mojitos were wrong. The waitress immediately blamed the bartender saying ""he is new"" and took no personal responsibility for the mess up or the wait time. They finally got their drinks after they closed their tab and finished their meal. We were going to order dessert, but really we just wanted to get out of there.

The appetizer dishes are even sized like regular entrees here, so if you want to leave room for a cheesecake slice or two, beware.  Since the menu is so large, I've been trying not to eat the same thing twice, SO, I can only say that I've never been disappointed.  I wish I could describe my favorites to you, but really, you just have to go and see for yourself.  This place isn't some 'out of this world' restaurant, but it's a definite stand by, especially if you're craving cheese cake.   The cheesecakes I've tried:  banana cream, red velvet, chocolate mousse, dulce de leche, vanilla bean, pineapple upside down, caramel pecan turtle, carrot cake.  That's quite a list!  They're all good and of course it all depends on what you're craving but the banana cream cheesecake ranks high up there for me.  :)  They're creamy and really FULL of flavor.  They're so sweet your teeth are likely going to hurt after one bite.  I don't think I've ever finished a slice due to the richness. The service is good, I've not had bad service here yet and I've been to quite a few Cheesecake Factories.  They don't have call ahead seating or even take reservations, so be prepared to go there for an early (before 7) or late (an hour or two before closing) dinner; if not, you might be in for a long wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=140

Personally, it's one of my favorite restaurants along with CPK. I just want to point out something my waitress did last time I was there---something most servers at any other restaurant always fail to do. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich (so delicious) and asked for it without tomatoes. Our waitress asked me if I wanted the side salad without tomatoes as well. And for that, I am so appreciative.  Everywhere else I go (ie: Red Robin), I order whatever without tomatoes and then get a side salad that turns out to be full of chopped up tomatoes that are too plentiful to pick out and taint the lettuce with their gross taste/guts. I always forget to question tomatoes on salad so I'm so happy that someone at Cheesecake can put together that if I don't like it on my sandwich, I probably won't like it on my salad either!! Thank you so much! Even the little things like that deserve the recognition in my book.

Our favorite entrée has always been the chicken marsala pasta. Their cheesecakes were pretty yummy as well.  However, our entrees this time was very unappetizing. My girlfriend got the wasabi crusted ahi tuna and I got the hibachi steak. My girlfriend said her ahi tuna was very mushy and wasn't fresh. My hibachi steak (which I have had numerous times and was delicious) was missing the sauce, it was just the steak itself and I had to ask for the sauce separately later.

Caroline W.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,18,,3.0,2/24/2011,"Like I saw in another review - you should absolutely try to share your entree with someone else! The portions are family sized. I've tried a fair amount of things here, most are just pretty good. Nothing is usually amazing, and some things are just downright disappointing. A lot of their salads are bland, or coated in so much cilantro you can hardly tell the difference between them. The appetizers are just okay as well, such as the avocado rolls. It was almost difficult eating four of them, plus I was full afterward. Stars of the menu? BBQ chicken pizza (rivals CPK, the master). It's great at lunch because you get a reasonable sized pizza paired with a half salad. It's only about $13 because its the lunch menu, yet its still enough to feed two people. They also have some good pastas, but you feel like you've shortened your life by a few years after eating any of them. And of course, the desserts are amazing. It goes without saying that the cheesecake is good, but they also have a cinnamon apple dessert that comes with ice cream that is so delicious you don't know what to do with yourself. The size of it varies, but once I ordered it to go and I swear they gave me at least a pound of food. It lasted me a full weekend, just reheated the apples in the microwave and saving the ice cream in the freezer.  Downsides of the whole place would be that its always packed and lunch and they don't even do call ahead seating unless you're in a big group, and the bread they serve while you wait is just pitiful.

Hence the name Cheesecake Factory, if you're hungry for one of their exclusive cheesecakes, I recommend the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  My family and I have tried a few others, but none of them are like the Oreo Dream Extreme, with layers of fudge cake and Oreo cookie mousse, topped with milk chocolate icing and an Oreo cookie!  Not only that, for every slice of Oreo Dream Extreme you have, 25 cents is donated to Feeding America.  Imagine enjoying yourself for dessert while helping hungry families in America.

I also don't get why one portion is big enough to feed three of four girls from the Facts of Life--Natalie can tackle her own plate I'm sure.  Even the side salads are massive...why?  At the risk of sounding un-american, it's just a grandiose waste of food.  I can't imagine how much food is trashed by the end of an average day, whether it's by the restaurant or people who take leftovers to go.

Gina T.,"Sterling, VA",946,27,4,1.0,11/21/2008,"If I could give them zero stars, I would. We just went for  dinner. Family of four, Friday night 7pm. Wait time was average. Food was ok. Service was terrible.  It started when two meals were brought out and then several minutes passed before the other two showed up.  One wasn't what was ordered. It was reordered and appeared after we were finished eating (sharing food with the person with the missing dinner).  Then they dropped the check off. Only it wasn't ours. And had someone else's credit card in it. After a few minutes of staring at an unfamiliar VISA card - we asked for the manager. Twice. Finally I picked up my cell phone and called the manager. He came over to our table.   He was not in the least sorry or apologetic.  He asked if it was our card that was sent to the wrong table - when it wasn't - he didn't care. He did not care about the service.  He did not care about the security of his customers.  He just plain didn't care. No apologies. Nothing. For added fun - when they did give us our bill - the pen didn't even write.

Chad H.,"Bethesda, MD",2,36,4,2.0,4/13/2008,"Generally speaking, I can't stand this chain. This weekend on a night out in Sterling my friends chose this place to eat, and I didn't have much choice but to come along because I was pretty hungry.  I have to give it to this place that it looks pretty nice, but right off the bat I can't stand the noise level in here. I felt like I was at a rock concert. The lighting... way to dim. I wear glasses for God's sake, and I was still struggling to make my way to the table.... AFTER the 30 or so minute wait to get the table. During this wait I suggested IHOP, which has never failed my late-night 24/7 cravings, but some of the high-class whiney pricks that tagged along with one of my friends wouldn't let that happen. So Cheesecake Factory it is. Once we finally got our menus, I didn't know what the hell I was supposed to order. I love Chicken Salad, so I got the Chicken Salad Sandwich. After 20 or so minutes, our food came out, and by this time I had gone deaf and couldn't hear my own voice so I didn't bother asking for a refill of my water for fear I would just be making inane blabbing noises. The Chicken Salad Sandwich came out with huge portioning. It was actually 2 sandwiches cut in half, stuffed to the max, with some wierd nasty salad on the side made up of tasteless greens from my neighbor's backyard, smothered of course in a sour vinaigrette. The bread was so overly toasted that I nearly choked per my lack of water. The Chicken Salad itself was more like Mayonnaise with bits of chicken and whatever else in it... NUTS. Almonds I think? Or some annoying crunchy nutty thing. I'm not gonna lie, those nuts were pissing me off.  Despite my bad experience I still tipped well, which is just general courtesy that I've gotten accustomed to. But honestly this damn chain of restaurants is so over-hyped. I doubt I'll ever willingly go back to any of these places again.  I HAVE heard good things about the cheesecake, but I'm afraid it's made of mayonnaise so I'll pass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=200

I'm not a big CCF eater but whenever I've got family visiting or friends from out of town and I need to pick a spot where everyone can find something to eat and eat due to their gargantuan sizes I pick the CCF.  Well I had relatives in town again and went to this new outpost in Loudon  due to the closeness it was to them. Big mistake.  The wait wasn't bad to get the table but I have a feeling how the restaurant is set up that if your table isn't in the center spots closer to the kitchen the service would take just as long if you were basically in outer Mongolia. The service here was awful. Our spacey server sent our salad out to the wrong table and then took over 20 minutes to replace it, asking if we wanted a cup of soup in the meantime. How long does it take for one of these salads to be made? My fish and chips were cold and soggy, not one of their better attempts for when I do get this meal.  The Tons of Fun Burger looked like a monster and my cousin loved every bite of it. The Chicken Madeira is always good but don't get caught up eating the two pounds of mashed potatoes that it comes with. The Miso Salmon is another favorite but what gives with the 4 snow peas and the mountain of rice.  Still the CCF is a good to have for guests but making a habit of eating here will expand your waistline faster than the growth rate of Loudon county.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=200

I wish Dr. Jones was with me to venture through the fucking brick book that is their MASSIVE MENU. Does it really need 40 plus pages?  After taking notes and plotting a hunger graph, I calculated the slope of my ass would result in ordering a Chinese salad. I felt rather full after visually ingesting three years of culinary dishes offered as electives, at your local University. what I'm having trouble saying is that the menu has way, way to many pages.  Getting there, I walk upon the host and a server eye fucking the shit out of each other that I was embarrassed. Embarrassed what her mother must think her daughter has become. In public?! Have ye no shame? After karate chopping through them to get her attention we get sat at a lovely booth, right between the kitchen and the server station.

The server acknowledged the request but the bread never came.  We had to flag down our server 25 minutes later while we were already half way into our meals and made a second request for some bread.  The server nods and came back with a basket of bread 10 minutes later (to which we had just finished our meal).  Not once did the server ask how our meal was.  We had to flag down the server to order our desserts.  The dirty plates were left on our table for a good 15 minutes until our desserts finally arrived.  We also had to wait a long time to get and pay for our check.  While the server is a nice guy, he seems inexperienced and very preoccupied which made it very difficult for us to enjoy our dinner.  Being a family of three, we had expected to be in and out of the restaurant within an hour however we ended up sitting in the restaurant for over 2 and a half hours, mainly waiting for our server.  We are extremely disappointed with tonight's dinner service at the Cheesecake Factory and wished we had chosen another restaurant for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=220

Everything I've tried has been appalling, not in a ""Oh my god, this is nasty"" way, but in the ""this has no finesse, no taste at all"" kind of way.   For example, I tried their ""Shepherds Pie"", and the vegetables (carrots, onions, etc) weren't cooked, they were raw, or blanched at best.  Think about that for a second - in making a pan sauce, what kind of flavor can be extracted from uncooked vegetables?  I had to douse it in salt just so I could tell I wasn't eating (crunchy) library paste - just hamburger in water ""sauce"" with raw shredded carrots.  There was another entree (so unmemorable I can't remember what it was) that was identical, raw vegetables rather than cooked, and no flavor as a result.  I tried roasted chicken (was overcooked and dried out before I got out of bed that morning), fish tacos (same, dried-out fish, no taste) - seriously, every entree I've tried just had no flavor.  Maybe just bad luck / bad choices on my part, maybe there's goodness to be found on that vast wasteland of a menu.  But I've given up trying - I don't feel the need to go on such a fishing expedition when I have to pay for it, and have been disappointed with every previous attempt.   The cheesecakes are mostly quite good, and on occasion, I'll just go in, (torn between pity and contempt for all those waiting for tables), and buy a slice of cheesecake to go (they're no bargain, but you only live once; you gotta indulge once in awhile, right?)  As noted, they *have* reduced the size of their slices (but not the price.)  And I did get Red Velvet cake that was definitely not fresh.   Which brings me to a second point, mentioned by another reviewer.  Invariably, the servers behind the counter are far too busy flirting with each other, or talking about their plans after work, to actually provide any service.   I mean, I get it, I was a teen-ager once, (admittedly, back during the last Ice Age), but you're working, or at least, are theoretically being paid to work, so put the hormones on ice once in awhile - space it out, you know?   Try to work 5 minutes, take a 2 minute ogling break, then back to work.  And what's particularly irritating is that they all have this attitude that they're runway models, just there to look good, and actually working isn't required.  I've got news for you kids, you're high-school students, the job you're working isn't particularly prestigious,  and frankly, you're just not that hot.  So keep it together, work the register, and just bring us our dam cheesecakes! Table service isn't usually something to complain about -- but when it's consistently unprofessional, it has to be mentioned.  And so it is - consistently sub-par and unprofessional.  Funny, someone mentioned an issue with the bill - twice I've had problems there, once when I was brought the wrong table's bill, and once when I was charged for an item we hadn't ordered.  And, of course, the waitress was miffed with *me* for pointing it out.  And I've also had the experience of overhearing servers complaining about patrons, and other servers, and other misbehaviors. I guess the ultimate description of how I feel about this place is this - once I was invited to attend a birthday dinner for a co-worker, with the tab being picked up by my company,  I feigned illness, and bought my own dinner.  That's right, I passed on a free dinner here to pay for my own somewhere else. If you order anything more than coffee and cheesecake, you're probably making a mistake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=220

I sat along barside at a small table for four. Menu was quite extensive making my choice very difficult. Had the sliders for my appetizer and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake which was off the chain! I mentioned that not only was it my birthday but I was also active duty Military. Do you think they would offer some sort of discount? Not a chance, as they join many that are more concerned about their bottom line than those who protect the freedom of this country. If there is one thing that often bothers me it is the fact that they will give discounts to senior citizens but not to members of the armed forces. Though there are many establishments that appreciate our service to this country, this is obviously not one of them.

I know that the food is exactly the same at every restaurant, and that should lead me to question if it's really made fresh, or if they're just microwaved bags of food, BUT I can't help it. I like the Cheesecake Factory. I've liked it ever since the first time I went there back in like 1999 or whenever it was. I've liked every single one I've been to, including this one in Sterling. My wife and I go here about once every one or two months, and we always have a good time. The food is good, the service is good, the ambiance is good. I usually get the Jambalaya Chicken Pasta or the Pasta Da Vinci, or the Chicken Marsala. But really, almost everything on the menu is delicious, and it's always more than enough food.  The Cheesecake is five-star delicious every time. The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle are two of my favorites, but I have yet to have a cheesecake there that wasn't really delicious. The Key Lime is good, but a little overpowering after the first couple of bights.

Rita M.,"Tallahassee, FL",232,174,9,2.0,8/18/2012,"For as celebrated of a chain as it is, I am not sure I understand the Cheesecake Factory hype. The dinner menu is extremely monotonous. I went with the chicken alla panna and it was kind of tasteless and dull. I enjoyed the heaping side of mashed potatoes it came with but that should hardly be the high point of a dish. The cheesecakes were extremely tasty, albeit so dwarfed by mountains of whipped cream that I had to scrape off some of the topping to enjoy the actual cake. I wish they would add a fruit element to the vanilla bean cheesecake because it gets super sweet and one-dimensional after a few bites. Two stars off because out waiter looked like he truly hated his existence on Earth and was sweating uncontrollably.

Calamari was awesome!  My lithmus test of great calamari is when I don't need to add anything else to the appetizer but a squeeze of lemon juice (and sometimes, not even that!).  Simple, yet divine. Ordered a to-go slice of Fresh strawberry cheesecake for Mom, which no one touched until three days later, and not by Mom, either (you three know who you are!).  Judging by not seeing a single crumb on anyone's plates 60 seconds later, I'd say the cheesecake slice with its two small, glazed strawberries tasted fantastic!  I could be wrong... (I should reiterate that the new serving slices are much smaller than they used to be!) TCF: this easily could've been four stars, but thumbs-down for halving your dessert portions yet retaining original prices!  You could've at least knocked the serving price down one or two dollars...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-dulles?start=160

From now on I will definitely be requesting a booth from the get go, so we don't have to walk to a squeezed in tiny table next to randoms (at which time I say oh actually we'd like a booth thanks...)  Sooo when our waiter came he seemed all rushed even though we hadn't been waiting long. He wreaked, obviously having just come back from a smoke break. Fab.  I decided to be adventurous and healthy so I ordered a barbecue chicken salad. Every ingredient in this thing looked and tasted like it came from a can. I know the portions are gigantic but that just made it worse... because this salad sucked.  The cheesecake slice that I always end up taking home was good though... Anyway from now on I will be less adventurous and may just end up getting take out to save all the hassle.
