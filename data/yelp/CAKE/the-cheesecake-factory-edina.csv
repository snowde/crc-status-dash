Lee G.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,58,,2.0,10/2/2015,"You get 2 stars just because of lunch price. I ordered a lunch salad and pop.  Cost me $22 with tip.  Really?  I just think you need reasonable lunch prices.  I asked waiter and was told there was even a bigger salad served at dinner.  What?  That salad I received was big enough for 2 people that I was served.  Let's be serious about portions Cheesecake Factory.  No room for cheesecake with those size portions. For lunch hour, I should have left paying no more than $15 with tip for a simple salad w/a little chicken on it. ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=140

Mollee F.,"Chaska, MN",80,191,,4.0,3/17/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has been around forever, and yet, is still popular enough to encounter a 40-minute wait at 1:45 p.m. on a Saturday. Crazy.  I usually dodge requests to go to the Cheesecake Factory because I've never not encountered a wait, but I relented over the weekend. The upside to waiting is that you can head into the mall and do some shopping as you wait for a table to open up. The buzzer won't work, but staff are good about letting you know an appropriate time frame for coming back.  The menu here is just obscenely huge. Whatever you're hungry for, they probably have it. I ordered just a basic hamburger and was pleasantly surprised by how perfect it was. No frills, just cooked to order and tasty.  My dining partner got the club sandwich and was also happy with her order. We split a piece of white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for dessert and while it had an excessive amount of whipped cream decorating the top, it was delicious.  Wait staff here are very good - attentive and friendly. If this place took reservations, I wouldn't hesitate to head back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=140

Lina H.,"Rochester, NY",445,173,548,4.0,4/15/2012,"If you're looking for a place that is open after midnight then you found it. Yea, I was surprise too! They are open till 12:30am on fri and sat.. regular days till 10pm I admit, I'm a fan of this chain. the service is always satisfactory and the price is very reasonable. Because this is the only cheesecake factory in the state of minnesota, it's always busy. Expect to wait 40 mins during dinner hrs BUT only 10 mins during the late weekend. Like I've mentioned on my tip, I'm a devoted  lover of their Fettuccini Alfredo w/ chicken. I've been ordering the same dish for the past 12 years. It's so rich in cream and the sun dried tomatoes definitely adds a zest to the taste. I also would recommend their miso salmon- the glazed salmon and rice goes perfect together. i tried to mimic their garlic noodles at home- mission failed. I'll stick to ordering from cheesecake instead. as far as cheesecake goes, i like their white chocolate truffle and the Oreo one is great too.... but if you like red velvet like i do, skip the cheesecake and go for the ultimate red velvet cake instead!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=140

It rang 100 times with no answer. Called back, same thing. Called back again,she picked up and said ""let me transfer you to the bakery"". Then it rang another 100 times with no answer. Called again, finally got someone. Placed the order for an hour later. When we arrived at the exact appointed time, I called the special number again with no answer! Called again as I was angrily walking inside to get the order myself, then someone finally picked up. They told me my order wouldn't be ready for another 5-10 minutes! Aaarrrgg!

Lisa M.,"Saint Paul, MN",99,470,221,2.0,6/7/2011,"I can't even believe I went here.  I was at the movies with some friends and we wanted lunch. Walked in around 1:30ish on a Saturday, it was very quiet.  I hadn't been there in years and now I know why - to me, it's nothing special. I wonder who would wait for a while to get a table, but then I realized it takes so long to even get a grasp on the menu.  We were seated at a fairly large table, which was good and we ordered some drinks, which came fairly quick. What isn't quick is trying to decide what to have. The damn menu is just too big! Do I want a regular sized salad, an appetizer size salad, or a salad and something combo? Do I want an appetizer or a small plate? Ahhh. Too many decisions.  I settled on a Coors Light, a small arugula salad, and a sausage and ricotta pizette. Our group ordered various items and I can say for sure, the fried mac and cheese balls (I know, what am I eating those for?) with marinara were the best thing we had. I had 1/4 of the large ball and that was enough. My salad and pizette were the perfect size for me considering the pizza and salad combo was gigantic.  My bill was around $16 for the beer and snacks. I thought the price was fine, I guess I'm just not crazy about the place.  The service was good, she was pleasant enough, but a little hover-y, the price was right, although I'm not sure a Coors Light bottle should be $4.75, the menu too big and nothing is spectacular. I would not go back if given the choice.  PS - I don't really like cheesecake, so I didn't even try it,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=140

Then there's ricotta cheese in the middle. It was AMAZING. Literally. The service is very good but the reason I gave it 4 stars is the wait. Didn't expect a table right away and I guess for this restaurant 1 hour 10 minutes isn't that long. The cheesecake is really good, and I don't even like cheesecake.

Cheesecakes: gotta try the red velvet and the white chocolate blueberry..... oh and also the caramel apple streusel!

Tamera B.,"Plano, TX",196,214,174,2.0,6/18/2013,"We're from Chicago and visited Minneapolis for Father's Day weekend. My husband and I couldn't agree on a ""new"" restaurant to try, so we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory because in Chicago it's always a solid choice; food is always good and you know what you're getting. Sadly, this wasn't the case at this location. We ate here twice on this trip and we were disappointed both times.  The first meal was dinner. I ordered the Ne Orleans Shrimp, which is a dish I've had frequently at Cheesecake Factory's all around the country. On this particular occasion, it was cooked with the wrong sauce (it was yellow) and it had a curry-like taste to it. This ruined my entire meal and it was really late, so I didn't have the energy to complain and wait for a new meal to be prepared. The next meal we had here was brunch on Father's Day. We ate here mostly be use of convenience. Every other restaurant had a long wait and we were trying to make it to the Twins game. Anyway, my husband ordered egg whites, ham, and toast. My son's ordered ""crispy"" bacon with their meals. So, all of the food came out except my husband's. The waitress said that the cook forgot to only cook egg whites. So, about 7 minutes later, my husband gets his food with steaming hot eggs and cold meat and toast........yummy!!! Next, they only brought bacon for one of my sons and it was no where near crispy. We requested crispy bacon again and the waitress attempted to take my 4 year olds entire plate of pancakes back to the kitchen, just to get crispy bacon. The distraught look on his face was all she needed to sit the plate back down and she said she would just bring a side of bacon. So, she shows up about 1 minute later with some COLD crispy bacon. I imagine this was pre cooked bacon used to top salads and/or soups, because it obviously wasn't cooked that fast. We were tired of going back and forth an my son starting eating it so we just left it alone. My other son's bacon was never brought out, but we just told our waitress to take it off the check. So........on future trips to Minneapolis, we now know that Cheesecake Factory IS NOT an option and we would NOT recommend this place to anyone. PAY ATTENTION TO THE LOW STAR RATING ON YELP!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=140

Michael K.,"Seattle, WA",299,631,40,4.0,12/12/2012,"I know and understand the complaints about the Cheesecake Factory and the fact that this restaurant is trying to cater to Edina residents with its' decor while catering to the Sumo Federation of America with its' portions, I really can't complain based on the fact that huge portions make me happy.  It's overwhelming to look through the menu with no idea what you're feeling like so I would suggest picking a genre of food before showing up or you may find yourself in desperate tears while the waitress looks at you with a knowing condescension.   It really is lovely inside and the food is better than PF Changs.   What - it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=140
Matthew K.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,17,,1.0,7/9/2014,"The first time I came here, I was blown away. The menu is huge, there are endless choices, and they really live up to the cheesecake part of the name with a wide selection of expensive slices. Unfortunately, they also live up the ""factory"" part of the name, which is really not a good thing. Their portions are generally large, which is sometimes a good thing, and other times you wonder how you are going to get rid of a plate full of subpar, bland food. If you plan on drinking, make sure to ask for prices. They don't have a price list, but they will ""guess"" how much each drink is. Mixed drinks run around $10 and up (and aren't very impressive), and beer runs around $5. Happy hour is only at the bar.  I also feel it's my civic duty to warn any non-meat eaters: STAY AWAY! I have had meat in my meatless dishes not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. Each time, staff was apathetic. The first time, there was chicken (small shreds, everywhere, so at first it wasn't completely apparent) in a non-chicken fettuccine. The manager came over and said, ""oh, well, someone in the kitchen must have used the same tongs for chicken as they did for the pasta."" Basically, he shrugged it off, didn't offer to replace our dinner OR compensate us, and said, NO BIG DEAL. JUST CROSS-CONTAMINATION IN OUR KITCHEN.  Actually, it is a big deal, and it literally made me sick. I had to email the company and they gave me a gift card, which I used to buy their portabella and zucchini fries. Nearing the bottom of the batch, I poured them out and found, guess what? FRIED CHICKEN SKIN. I gave one to a meat-eating friend to verify, and she said it was definitely chicken. I had to stop there and laugh, but I also quickly got the check and got the hell out. I really want to love this place. It has so much potential, but between the apathetic staff, the long waits, and the subpar food, there isn't a whole lot to love. Not to mention the whole cross-contamination problem, which for some reason doesn't seem to phase the managers or servers. To be honest, the only saving grace of this place is their bread baskets. Seriously, so good, and so far I haven't found any meat lurking at the bottom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=140

Kimlinh B.,"Eden Prairie, MN",29,101,12,1.0,11/25/2009,"Disclaimer: I have never liked the food at the Cheesecake Factory, and I've eaten at locations in Raleigh, DC, Atlanta, Milwaukee and now, Edina. My sister wanted cheesecake for her birthday, so I'll admit I was dragged to this dinner.  I went in with low expectations, but hoping to be pleasantly surprised. It's been a few years since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory...  The decor is nice, the booths comfortable, the hostess stand was well organized, the cheesecakes in the case looked appealing, and the place was so busy on a Tuesday night I figured it couldn't be that bad. Then I looked at the menu. First warning sign: It's about 20 pages long. If the menu is unfocused, the kitchen is unfocused. That tells me they do a mediocre job on a variety of things - a little bit of Asian fusion, a little Tex-Mex, alongside burgers, seafood and steak. Second, the prices are high for what you're getting. Sure, the portions are large, so there's a high perceived value, but do we really need to stuff our faces? I'd rather be given the option to order half portions or simply go to a better restaurant and get quality food for my money. Ahi Tartare: small dices of tuna on avocado, plated in a ring mold and served with 4 crispy wontons and pickled ginger. Totally unoriginal, but the flavors were good.  However, the avocado was cut in huge unwieldy chunks, rather than diced the same as the tuna. I'm not just nit-picking on an aesthetic point. It makes eating the dish easier, and shows attention to detail on the part of the kitchen. This looked like someone scooped avocado chunks from the sandwich bar. Beets with Goat Cheese: not enough beets, not enough goat cheese. The candied pecans were good. Crispy Chicken Taquitos: bland, bland, crispy, bland. And I don't even like that much salt. The salsa was bland; the guacamole was bland.  Wild Mushroom Soup: I liked the large chunks of mushroom, and even though it was a little on the salty side for me, it was very creamy and tasty. It was too thick, though. I ordered soup, not porridge.  Chocolate-Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake: disappointing. There was a vague aroma of raspberry liquor, but no actual fruit or raspberry glaze or sauce to provide the necessary tart, fruity tang to balance out the overwhelming creaminess of the chocolate cheesecake.   I used to think Cheesecake Factory had fine cheesecake and bad food. Now I just don't understand the appeal at all. However, every location I've ever been to has always been hopping, there's always a wait, and apparently people are willing to pay their outrageous prices, so there must be something I just don't get.  The only time I'll ever go back to a Cheesecake Factory is if someone else is paying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=200

It's too damn good and i would feel like i'm cheating on the meatloaf if i were to try anything else!  I did, however, try one of their appetitzers and the Avacodo Eggrolls were scrumptious.

We went on a Tuesday night and we still had to wait about 25-30 minutes for a table. Popular place.  The server was nice but it was very hard to hear her. I also thought it was a little dark in there. The menu is HUGE, it's almost ridiculous. It was hard to choose what to get. We ended up sharing the big appetizer sampler thing, and I also got a salad.  The brown bread they brought out was great. The salad I had (Boston House Salad) was delicious. Most of the appetizers were pretty good. I didn't care for the spring rolls and didn't try the calamari or the avocado rolls (whatever they were called) but everything else was good.  The best part, not surprisingly was the cheesecake. I ordered a piece of red velvet cheesecake and a piece of vanilla bean to take home.

Tonight I got cream cheese crab wontons (yummy, but dipping sauce not my fave), and a burger. The burger had more muenster cheese than I've *ever* seen on one piece of food, plus avocado and a nice, tart mustard sauce. It was excellent and so large I could hardly finish it.  Side salad with the burger was quite good too, although a little wilted from being ""drenched"" with dressing (but the dressing was good). Usually, I get the ""small plate"" endive salad (yum!) except I like it with Ranch dressing more than the vinagrette it normally comes with.  Then, I'll order an appetizer like the avocado egrolls and call it a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=200
Mike C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",16,131,11,3.0,4/12/2012,"Visited the Southdale location yesterday and was mildly impressed. Upon entry I was pleasantly surprised by the decore. I don't know if I have actually ever been to a Cheesecake Factory and if I have it has probably been a while, so it is completely possible that subconsciously definition of The Cheesecake Factory has been slowly built through the many episodes of ""Big Bang Theory"" that I have watched. The floors are white marble, the booths and tables are constructed of some sort of dark wood, and the lighting is a bit brighter than dim which helps make this place seem more classy. I ordered the Chicken Marsala which was served on a bed of bow tie pasta and one stray tube of penne pasta. Chicken Marsala is typically one of my favorite Itallian dishes as it offers the perfect balance of sweet and salty with the nice Marsala wine flavor. The portion that came was fairly large and came with a good amount of chicken and mushrooms and a nice brown gravy. If presentation were the only catagory I was judging this place on they would have certainly earned at least one additional star. After the first few bites I noticed that the chicken did not really have any flavor itself, and the Marsala sauce resting on the chicken was the only thing giving the dish any life at all. This immediately made me think of a large metal tin resting gently on a tub of hot water, in the kitchen, piled high with chicken breasts and ""chefs"" pulling from this pile, throwing them onto a bed of (insert pasta type here) then going over to the sauce bin, slathering the plate with (insert sauce type here), right before being served. More or less your high end production assembly line type of food service (for clarification: high end for this catagory is at best 3 stars). The Marsala sauce had nice initial flavor, unfortunately the back end tasted a bit watered down. I don't like wasting food, so I finished the chicken and mushrooms, but the pasta and watery sauce was too much for me to be able to put it down. Being that we were at the Cheesecake Factory and that I love Cheesecake, this made for a very nice arrangement! If you are an avid Cheesecake lover such as myself they basically have every variety of cheesecake you would ever want. Fruit toppings, chocolate toppings, candy bar toppings, Orea toppings, combinations thereof, the list is endless and one should literally decide by throwing a dart into a board. We ended up with the Snickers Cheesecake and it was delicious! Had we just come here for dessert, easily 4 stars. It tasted like the whip cream was made in-house; it was nice and cold, thick, and paired very nicely with our cheesecake, and I can easily see it pairing well with fruit topped cheesecakes as well. Overall the experience was enjoyable, I just wish the food tasted better (especially for the price), and that the server came around a bit more frequently. Their long list of cheesecakes will probably bring me back sometime in the near future, but unfortunately probably not for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=200

The waiter couldn't give a damn to really help us, never gave us the specials ( heard him tell others as they say down) and could rarely be found.

I'm really glad that we decided against an appetizer, because zomg big effing portions. I was so stuffed and couldn't finish my chicken, which btw was delicious! I had asked the waiter to recommend some stuff to us, since their menu goes on forever (it truly is out of control), and that was one of the things he recommended, so I took a shot. It comes with mashed potatoes, a whole mountain of them, and two flattened chicken breasts breaded with....something, covered in cheese and asparagus, and then there's this sauce....idk it's like some kind of gravy that involves crack. All I know is that it was really really good. This could also be the lemon drop talking...I'm not sure. It's entirely possible that they booze you up before the food comes so you think it's amazing. We got cheesecake to go. That tuxedo business...it's got a lot of chocolate in it, so it's probably going to be good.  I can DEFINITELY see how annoying this place could be on a busy night, though. For as much as we enjoyed the atmosphere and the lack of other patrons (although their decor features a repetitive ""eye of sauron"" theme), by the time we left the annoying mall people and their tiny, loud children were arriving. Don't get me wrong, I love kids, I just don't like dining with them. So, I guess what I'm saying is go. Go during lunch time...maybe around 1 or 2 pm, and bring a lot of people so you can all get different dishes and then eat off each other's plates. Then get cheesecake to go.

Andrew B.,"Saint Paul, MN",4,41,,2.0,5/20/2014,"I'm truly at a loss on how to rate this place.  It's one of the most bewildering restaurant experiences I've had all year. By the time I left, I had experienced a number of emotions: shock, sadness, horror, anxiety, embarrassment, contempt, and apathy to name a few. My first observation on walking in is how vast the space is, with it's large booths, presumably to better service it's large patrons.  As I took my seat I was given a menu the size of a novella. The sheer amount of choices was immediately overwhelming. For the first time of many that evening, I was forced to face some of the worst traits of American culture. How could a kitchen possibly handle such a hyperbolized variety? Only if your goal is to flame the culinary vanity of a mundane crowd. It seemed like mere minutes after I ordered when the food arrived. Apparently in America, you're not supposed to order slow, and have a relaxed multi-hour dinner with camaraderie. The dining experience here has been reduced to an inhuman mechanical action: get in, eat, get out. In addition, the portions are offensively large, often achieving a caloric density not previously thought possible, perhaps even hitting the upper limits of physics.  I felt as if I was being grasped at the back of the head, forced to gaze upon America's disgusting gluttony, to revel in all the waste, to force me to contend with the obesity around me. The worst part? The Cheesecake Factory has no shame; it offers no apology. It accepts this cultural degeneracy, and happily promotes it. There is no noble goal to skirmish with the ignorance of it's customers, but further raises the curtain. There is certainly no complaint from the eaters, as they stuff their bloated faces.  Of the things I tasted, they ranged from okay to bad--expected given the size of the menu. The best thing I tried was this delightful little salad that came with my tacos. A tiny paradise amongst the sea of butter, cream, and grease. The disturbing experience left me enervated, leaving me to ponder my existential place in this country, and the future of our people.

Steve W.,"Andover, MN",15,100,,5.0,8/1/2007,"This was one of my favorite places to go when I lived closer to one in Arizona, but it's worth the occasional jaunt down to Edina just for lunch.   As a vegetarian it's rare that I look at a menu at a national chain and have a hard time picking what I want; there's usually only 2-3 items to choose from.  But The Cheesecake Factory is different.  First off, their menu is a book....literally.  Granted it has plenty of ads, but there's a lot of food to choose from regardless of your dietary preferences! My personal favorites are the avocado egg rolls and the grilled portobello on a bun, but be careful when you order.  Unless you can EAT, it's hard to get through an appetizer and an entree, even when sharing.  Portions are large and filling! One of the things that stands out about The Cheesecake Factory is actually just a little thing that means a lot to me.  Anyone that dines out with children knows that the most stressful time is the time between sitting down at the table and the point at which the food arrives.  Kids tend to get restless during this time and chaos can ensue (which is why Mexican food, with chips and salsa, is always a good option with kids!).  The Cheesecake Factory solves this problem by bringing out a small plate with some banana, orange and Cheerios that the kids immediately latch on to.  It's a great idea that is most appreciated by those of us with kids, not to mention those sitting nearby that might get some peace and quiet. And of course there's the cheesecake.  The only bad thing you can say about the cheesecake is that it's just too rich.  But that would be a stretch of a complaint! There can long waits for lunch and dinner so plan on spending a little more time waiting, but I can assure you that the wait is worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=240
Gabriella P.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,11,,4.0,6/23/2012,"Two words: Avocado Eggrolls, they are fantastic, and the sauce is delectable, I always start any meal at the Cheesecake Factory with the eggrolls, and I usually go for the Miso Salmon for my entree, it gets pricey in the dinner portion, but the lunch portion is super cheap and way more than enough food, even for those of you with hollow legs. They always have great food presentation, the service is generally superb, and their drinks are pretty great, the passion fruit mojito is really really good, the bellini is terrible. There is generally a wait so I would call ahead and put your name on the list just to be sure. ON the whole, this place is affordable and they have  a very large selection of foods, ranging from asian to american to meican to a delicious fusion. I am usually skeptical of a restaurant that tries to do too much with its menu, but I have to say that they do a wonderful job with all of their menu items, I have onlyonce had a bad experience, the food was cold, and the waitress switched our meals when she boxed the food, we didnt find out until it was too late to swap.... i took a trip to bummer town that night bc i was really looking forward to leftovers for lunch the next day... oh well!

It's alright, although it's difficult to say a club sandwich is worth $11.95. It should never be more than $5.95!  -The service. It was alright. Wasn't bad, wasn't wonderful.  The negatives-  -Location. Southdale is always packed, for whatever reason. It's tough to find a convenient parking spot. Which can be a plus I guess, to work off the 5 billion fat grams on the hike back to your car after eating a piece of cheesecake!  -I don't like Edina, but that's just me.  -Seating....we were seated at a tiny little table that was about 6 inches from each table beside us.  It was like dining with strangers.  Not easy to have a private conversation when you have strangers a foot away.  Who, by the way were fine on the right side, but weird as hell on the left.  They actually started questioning us about our food choices right as our food was brought to the table.  I was like, bitch, I am hungry, shut up so I can eat and mind your own business.  I didn't say this out loud, but it felt good to say it in my head. -A little on the spendy side (see above comment on the $11.95 club sandwich)  So, whatever. I got a kick ass piece of cheesecake.

When preparing to take our order for our cheesecake, he said there were a few cheesecakes not featured on the menu, but after hearing his description of the dessert, we realized that they were indeed on the menu. The Shepard's pie was very big and very filling! The Shrimp Vietnamese spring rolls were not good. They had too many chives and only a few pieces of shrimp scattered throughout the whole dish.

My savory Chicken Madeira hit the spot, although I also had a bite of the Chicken Costoletta, and I would definitely order that next time because it was light on the breading and the lemon was fresh in a tangy but not overpowering way. I was told the chopped salad was also excellent. We had cheesecake, of course! I branched out from my favorite (White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle) and I was not disappointed with my Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake. My friends highly enjoyed their very chocolaty cheesecakes, too, of which there is quite a variety.  The server was fun and friendly, but also gave us our space.

Catherine C.,"Northeast, Minneapolis, MN",169,205,1132,4.0,6/22/2015,"Quite possibly THE unhealthiest restaurant in America, but man, some of the dishes here are done extremely well, have quality ingredients and are tastefully presented! My favorite being the Chicken Bellagio on their Specialties menu. Angel hair, basil pesto sauce, crispy fried chicken breasts and my favorite part, the prosciutto and arugula on top. Wow.  Their Chipotle Chicken Pasta is also good, and their Avocado Egg Rolls are delicious for an appetizer.  Having a husband who does not eat avocados, they are all mine! Yay. Their hamburgers are good, probably similar to what you would find at Applebee's, not Red Cow. The Mac and Cheese burger is a yummy choice if you are looking for something different. Their French Fries are thick and fresh! Probably some of my favorite restaurant fries ever. The bread they serve with the meal is a French baguette and a Wheat Oatmeal loaf. Very good. For dessert I would recommend their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake, Godiva Chocolate, Lemoncello cheesecake and this seasonal one I tried yesterday, the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. Everything about that last sentence screams incredible and you should try them all if you are a cheesecake lover! What this place does best is utterly behemoth portions that last 2-3 days in the fridge and you can get lots of leftover meals from it. Cheesecake included. It looks like Vegas inside, with lots of ceiling decorations and painted walls. Reminds me of the Luxor and Caesar's Palace, very pretty.

Ellen C.,"Oakland, CA",148,710,23,4.0,1/2/2016,"One of the greats when it comes to chains. All Cheesecake Factories deliver consistently on service and food. There always seems to be a wait for this place, but unlike in SF, the wait is generally around 30 minutes to an hour. Ambience is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory, strangely pleasing despite being a chain, they've really got the design and experience down pat!  We got the grilled salmon (comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli) and the chicken bellagio (lightly crisped chicken breast on top of pesto spaghetti, prosciutto, and arugula). I've never been let down with any of the dishes I've had here, their pastas are always delicious (if you're not expecting hand made pasta), their avocado egg rolls are amazing. I've never had anything sweet or savory that I regretted here, so it's a safe choice and a great place if you just want a good, reliable meal without figuring out where to go.  This is located in the Southdale Mall, so if you don't want to wait you can try the other restaurants they have in the same mall (PF Chang's, Rojo's, an Italian fast food place) or you can go catch a movie @ AMC. There's always shopping! But remember that their buzzer doesn't work anywhere outside Cheesecake.

Even though they have like 1 million things on their menu it doesn't seem like they can even perfect one. I was highly disappointed and over spent way too much money and wasted time here.  It was the equivalent to having food from a frozen bag.  It was not clean I was overcrowded and the food was subpar by all means.  The only thing that was satisfying was the beer, which I might add the waitress delivered the wrong one the first time.  I don't want to say I hate it but I have a had some great times at CheeseCake when I have gone in the past.  I don't think I will be visiting here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=120
Heidi H.,"Minneapolis, MN",53,4,,2.0,6/27/2016,"Last Tuesday I went to dine here at 8:30 pm. The waiter seemed very nice and we got our drinks after a few minutes. I ordered the raspberry lemonade and it was so incredibly sour I could not drink it. I asked for the hibiscus instead. It took 30 minutes for that to come out.  When our food came, it was not what I ordered. The waiter who brought out the food told me he would have the manager come talk to us, that never happened. The waiter came back after 10 minutes and I told him the order was wrong and he said ""Oh yeah those 2 are right next to each other in the computer, I'll get it changed"". This would've been fine if they just re-fired the food right away. I know, working in the industry in the past, that you need to let the kitchen and manager know when you mess up an order so they can get it pushed to the front and it won't take long to make. I ordered the chicken picatta and it took ANOTHER 40 MINUTES for me to receive my food. By this time my date was done with his food (I told him not to wait).  We only saw the waiter during these couple times and he never came back to check on us and we never  saw the manager. Finally, the bill came and we were charged for BOTH drinks I had ordered even though I did not even drink the first one! He said he couldn't take it off the bill since it came to the table.. WHAT?!  For all the time we wasted (it wasn't even busy) this was not worth it. We weren't offered a discount or even free cheesecake or anything for all we went through. Luckily the food is good, but next time I am ordering to-go and won't dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=120

Kassi J.,"River Falls, WI",11,19,,2.0,2/21/2016,"I only gave this place 2 stars because the cheesecake isn't the worst that I've had. I have had better, even made better. Let's start from the top and work our way to the desert. Waited maybe 20 minutes, which was a relatively short time compared to other places (which were way better to eat at) that I have been to. Sat down and started looking over the long menu of 200 something items. I'll stop you at this point, that's a list of 200 disappointments to choose from. While everyone in our group had something different, not a single person was impressed with their meal. Ordered a couple of things to try off the snacks/sides/appetizer sections of the menu. Was not impressed really with ANY of it. Placed our main order in and half of the table's order came out. Waited several minutes before our waiter realized that only half the table got their order. Waited a few more minutes to get our plates. I had the bacon-bacon cheeseburger. There's nothing I love more than a good classic. This was the complete opposite. Bacon was BURNT to a black strip of what had appeared to be bacon. I almost cried for the bacon abuse! Started conversing with everyone else and their thoughts about their meal. Not a single dish was really worth the cost nor taking more than a couple of bites worth and feeling sick. Fries were salty as BLEEP! Had a glob of what appeared to be the 2 different cheeses on top of my burger. The special sauce really isn't a sauce, but more like some random ingredients pureed to a disgusting blob on the bottom of my burger. Everyone pushed their plates aside and waited, for what seemed like an eternity for our waiter to return. Ordered some deserts and was hoping at this time in the night that our horrid experience would make a turn for the better. Was let down yet again, and wasn't surprised. A hot fudge brownie sundae was ordered, was nothing more than some mere few pieces of brownie (that tasted old) and ice cream with-get this-Hershey's chocolate syrup that was cold served up. Whip cream? More like whipped milk! Even their so called famous cheesecakes were a joke! Over sugary, old, hard as a rock icing, thrown together mess of a desert better describes it!

Mickey C.,"San Jose, CA",0,24,1,1.0,1/1/2016,"PLEASE READ: AN HONEST AND IMPORTANT REVIEW!!!! I have never, in all my years, had as horrible of an experience in a restaurant as today. The female manger was completely rude and unprofessional and our food arrived far beyond late. I live in California and came to Minnesota to spend the holidays with my family. Needless to say, our time was rather precious, so imagine our huge disappointment with the atrocious service we received. Sit tight because there is quite a story to tell! First off, our server was a really nice guy, but he did put in the order for our appetizers late. We get it, it's New Year's Day, it's going to be crowded, but after waiting for an hour to get our table, we were not expecting this.  Even with the late order, the appetizers arrived exactly 50 minutes after ordering. Our appetizers not only took this long, but came one by one! Our first appetizer (the avocado egg rolls) was brought by a man who, after hearing about how long we waited, rudely responded by saying ""do you want it or not"". Our appetizers soon followed after 2 hours dedicated all to this restaurant. Oh yeah, the food! The two tables sitting next to us all received their food even after coming at least twenty minutes after us. One of our family members had to leave because he had to work!!! Our food came and it was fine, but at this point, we lost our appetite honestly. The manger, Jennifer, was INCREDIBLY RUDE. She took two appetizers off out of an order from a group of seven people and made far too many rude comments. She said that she would take care of the food of my family member, but we didn't realize she would take it off completely! When we asked to order it, she said that she would have to charge us. Really?!? He left because we had waited far more than an hour, and know we have to pay?! At this point, we were livid and wished to speak to the general manager. As Jennifer left, she said that she had been here for 12 years and was experienced for the job. She has been here for 12 years; that doesn't mean they were good years! Absolutely horrible. Anyway, in short, the general manager came, but none of the ""reductions"" could fix this horrible experience. I will certainly be contacting the main facility as this was beyond absurd. The food was fine, but the process to get it was beyond crazy. The manager was absolutely rude and the length for food arrival was absurd. On a side note, the general manger was nice (he came after Jennifer) and did compensate us, but like I said, this was a horrible evening all together!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=120
Andrew O.,"La Crosse, WI",7,4,1,1.0,4/23/2016,"The food is always on par! They try to do the best they can to feed a person with quality 5 star food. The seating issue and not having a reservation system at all times is ridiculous and such a cry for help for a restaurant that has maybe 100 tables and is one level unlike most Cheesecake Factory restaurants. They have people waiting for an hour or two for a table when they wouldn't have angry customers if they did reservations. For a restaurant that is as popular as it is and has the patronage that it does, it does not go anywhere near 5 stars on seating and wait times. And their hosts or hostesses are horrible at giving good time frames according to tables leaving and such. For the Twin Cities Cheesecake Factory, they have two issues that need to be resolved...a fully active reservation system with better seating arrangement with the strong thought of expanding!

I've ordered cheesecake several times to go from here.  Cheesecake is good, and the Cheesecake Factory does it best (most of the time).  I picked up two pieces for Valentine's Day - Cookie Dough and Kahlua.  One old favorite and one new flavor, which is how we generally do Cheesecake Factory takeouts.  The Cookie Dough we had tried before and LOVED.  This time, it had walnuts all over the top.  We do not recall that from last time, and for me walnuts kill it.  I thought it was actually nasty with nuts on it.  Very disappointing.  The Kahlua was good though.  Cookie Dough I'll never order again now. The biggest downfall this time was that I left with two very small slices of cheesecake and spent $18.  They've halved their slices and increased the price.  They have good cheesecake, sure, but they are bordering on robbery at this point.  It ain't THAT good, guys.  Maybe tone down the ripoff factor before you're charging 20 bucks per chew.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=120
Andy M.,"Edina, MN",5,27,31,3.0,11/30/2013,"Emphasis was on ""Factory"" that night (11/26), especially with a party of 8.  It started off odd. We had been told there would be a 15-20 minute wait. We were standing around (all seats/benches occupied with other wanna-be diners) for about 5 minutes when the pager went off. Excited that the wait was shorter, I showed others in our party and turned around to the host stand. Some host/manager guy said, hey, it's going to be about 15-20 minutes. I didn't know how to process the information, so I just said, ""um, yeah, you already told us that."" I thought about it and the people behind me that thought we were going to sit down and said, ""really, you paged me over here to tell me that? I thought our table was ready."" If it was a huge change in wait, I could see that, but it was more just odd. The food was mostly well-prepared, but the service was uneven. Any time you have people at the table going, ""oh, you guys go ahead and eat,"" you know there's trouble because enough time has elapsed that everyone's wondering where everyone else's meals are. There was about 5-10 minutes between the first plate and the last plate getting laid down. And no, no one ordered anything unusual or wanted special modifications. It was a weird night service-wise. The server was very personable and attentive at the table, but it took a while for drinks and bread, then we'd have these gaps of time where we wouldn't see him for a while. Their drink menu has a section of martinis - but none of the drinks on it are martinis, they're just these weird made-up sugary concoctions of bizarre flavor combinations. There was - honest to God - not a single martini on the page. I had to manually order a martini, specify an actual gin, and ask for olives. Sheesh! And it basically sucked. I hate that word, but it fits in this case. Made me feel like a idiot even ordering it. Oh well. Oh well, and about the menus, this is rich. These guys are so hard up for money, that they actually put ads for other stuff inside their menu. Not some food tie-in, just other stores at the mall (Southdale). So while I'm looking over the ridiculous non-martini Martini section, on the opposite page, I have some model leering at me with tacky-looking jewelry from some store in the mall. Ha! Another pet peeve - I ordered one of their burgers with fries. The fries came in a little metal bucket with a paper liner. The fries were just luke warm. Everyone that wanted to try one did what I did - ate 1-2, then no more. They're just gross when they're not hot. Oh, and if you're serving a burger with fries, you bring ketchup. Don't make me ask for it. That's another few minutes of waiting right there. They didn't even bring a bottle, just a little dressing bowl with a dollop of ketchup in it. Boo! Okay, soapbox mode off, but it was a strange dining experience. Oh, and yes, they do serve cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=120

The wait staff is great, they have always been very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable of the 20 page menu.  The food is always fantastic, and you can't leave without a piece of their cheesecake. If you like chocolate, I would suggest the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, it's like having chocolate silk in your mouth.   Parking at Southdale is annoying, and sometimes you have to wait, a long time, but if you plan it right and don't come during busy times, you'll be seated right away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=120

Joy H.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,35,,5.0,6/19/2009,"Say what you will about chain restaurants, but I like everything about The Cheesecake Factory and would tell anyone it's one of my favorite places to eat. The menu is extensive and varied with a lot of veggie options, the lunch combos are great, the food is fresh, the service has always been friendly and efficient, and the passion fruit iced tea is so good, I actually get cravings for it. To start, you're given wonderful sour dough and brown bread and they are happy to provide olive oil instead of butter. The edamame appetizer ($4.95) is perfectly steamed and salted, and a good portion of pods. The avocado eggrolls ($9.95) are delicious and decadent with chunks of avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro in a crisp wrapper with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce. If you eat shrimp, the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls ($8.95) are as good as those I've had in any authentic Asian restaurant. Also offered is guacamole made-to-order, sweet corn tamale cakes and a fire roasted artichoke with dipping sauce. The appetizer salads are abundant, colorful, fresh and easily a meal by themselves. The tossed green salad ($6.95) is the perfect house salad with tomato wedges, sliced cucumber and julienned beet, zucchini and carrot. I highly recommend the peanut cilantro dressing, but the Asian plum dressing and balsamic vinaigrette are also very good. Also tasty is the French country salad ($8.95) with beets, grilled asparagus and pecans (can hold the goat cheese) and the vegetable chopped salad ($8.95) with edamame, green beans, asparagus, cucumber, tomato, roasted beets and apple in a pomegranate vinaigrette (can hold the white cheddar). Lunch combos and portions are served every day until 5:00 p.m. and range from $7.95 to $10.95. My favorite is the roasted vegetable and goat cheese pizza with Japanese eggplant, artichoke, red and yellow pepper, Kalamata olives and tomato, paired with the tossed green salad. (Vegans, ask them to hold all the cheese on the pizza since there is parmesan in addition to goat cheese.) The Santa Fe entrée salad is simple southwestern goodness with greens, corn, black beans, tomato and tortilla strips in the spicy peanut-cilantro dressing ($9.95 for lunch portion; $13.95 for entrée size). You can hold the chicken and cheese and add avocado. The grilled portabella on a bun ($10.95) is a huge mushroom cap flavored with herbs topped with lettuce, tomato and grilled red onion (can add avocado and hold the cheese and the spicy mayo) served with fries, or they happily substitute any side. The incredible grilled eggplant sandwich is also great - again, I recommend adding avocado if you hold the cheese and mayo. A number of nice vegetable sides are available including broccoli, corn succotash, asparagus, sautéed spinach and snow peas with veggies, ranging from $3.95 to $6.50. Vegetarians can choose from more than 25 flavors of cheesecake and numerous other stunning desserts. There are no vegan dessert options, other than a pricey bowl of strawberries. The Cheesecake Factory is home away from home for my family as we've been eating at the Southdale location in Edina at least once a month since they opened and we've been to locations in other cities. Even after many visits, we've yet to try all the veggie options available, we're always pleased with the staff's willingness to accommodate our veggie requests and we always look forward to our meals there knowing that we'll leave happy.

The food of course was amazing but the service was absolutely horrible. As I walked in there were a few girls standing at the hostess podium. It wasn't until after they were done chatting did they acknowledge my party. As we were waiting on our food, which took FOREVER even though they weren't even that busy, I witnessed 2 waiters picking at their nose without ever washing their hands or removing themselves from the floor to go to the restroom. Absolutely every employee that worked there looked miserable. Not one employee was happy or even pleasant to talk to. Our waitress never refilled our drinks and I had to sip on my boyfriend's until we left. She was so rude and seemed like she absolutely hated her job.

But me and my boyfriend came in a Saturday knowing there would be a wait, so we came at 5pm. We were told that the wait was going to be 1 hour and 10 minutes, which we were fine with waiting. After waiting 1 hour and 35 minutes I decided to check to see where we were on the list (which I never like to be the person that always does that) and the girl looked at our pager number and looked on the computer and told us we were next up. So we stood closer to the host desk, so we were ready to go. After a table of 5, then a table of 2, then a table of 3, then another table of 2 got seated, I was getting confused and annoyed. I asked a different person why we haven't been seated and that we've been waiting for 1 hour and 45 minutes at this point when we were told it would only be 1 hour and 10 minutes and he quickly sat us and told the other hostess that the pager wasn't ever working. While we were waiting, we saw the hostess sometime go out and call for peoples name and we have never heard our named called, even when we were told that we were next up. So I wasn't furious for waiting that long, I was furious that they gave us a pager that didn't work and didn't attempt to call our name. After we got seated, I assumed that someone told them to put our orders on rush since we waited so long, because there was a couple that got seated 5 minutes after us and we had already gotten all of our good before they received their appetizers. We felt rushed to eat our 2 appetizers to have room for our entrees.

Maybe they wanted the design to match the menu- lots of random stuff thrown together but none of it done particularly well.  All dinner I was looking forward to the cheesecake.

Nikki M.,"Minneapolis, MN",645,53,131,4.0,7/26/2017,"Leaving the famous Cheesecake Factory a 4, ONLY because I go often and usually have a great experience there. Though in my last visit, I would've ranked it a solid 2.5, and that kills me 'cause I love CF. Went last night for the boo thang's early birthday dinner. The breakdown of last night's shenanigans: Drinks: - Asian Pear Martini: Yuuum! This more so felt like a dessert than anything. It was sweet, smooth, & delicious. Only complaint is that it felt like there was barely any alcohol in it (granted it's supposed to be a sweet drink). If you're looking for something boozy like me, this might not be the drink for you. Apps: - THEIR BROWN STARTER BREAD: That sweet, delectable, soft, brown goodness that they serve before every meal. Just... wow. I think I more so come just for that than anything else really. If I could start my days with that bread, I couldn't pasta-bly (ha) ask for more. - Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls: probably should've expected this 'cause... I mean... it's a pasta restaurant... but the their take on Vietnamese spring rolls were a huge no-go for us. We were pretty sure they pre-made it and left them in the coolers all day. Wasn't fresh AT ALL. Entrees: - Farfalle w/ Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Pasta: Now THIS was bomb. You'd have to order it to see what I'm talking about. Normally comes with chicken, but I switched and paid the upgrade for shrimp. Only complaint is again- last night being the weird variable- I was pretty sure they forgot about us 'cause the food took way too long to come out, and it also came out barely warm. Normally a great meal though and still highly recommend. - Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp: the boo somewhat liked it. Huge portions which was a plus and had a colorful variety on the plate. First time ordering it so perhaps if it came out hotter, we might've enjoyed it more. Overall- though last night's experience was off, in general, they're a great place to eat. Didn't get a chance to eat their cheesecake last night, but note that it's one of the best!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina

However I do not get the same feeling about the Cheesecake Factory here in Minnesota. Here's my experience: Last night me and some coworkers visited this establishment in edina for a Christmas celebration. Being a Saturday, we knew there would be a wait on getting a table. However, at check in the hostess said it would be an hour wait. So we went over to partake in a drink at the bar while waiting. We saw that the high top tables were available and was told we could eat there and they were open seating. So we took two high top tables and the waitress brought us our menus, water, and bread. 15 mins later she came back and took our orders, I order the Fish and Chips and there was 10 of us. So it took about 30 mins for ""our"" food to arrive so multiple people brought our food but not our server. Any who after the last waitress showed up with a plate I still was missing my food. Waiting 5 more minutes my food still didn't arrive and nor did our waitress come to make sure everything was ok. So midway through my party eating my waitress final shows up, which was about 20 mins after the food was served. It was clear that I had an empty place in front of me and I had not received my food but she went to the other side of the table with the people who were eating to ask if they were ok. So I motioned her to ask her where was and asked her where was my food. Her answer, ""oh you didn't receive your food, I don't know what happened well what did you order I'll have them remake it for you."" So I said, ""remake, what do you mean it was never made, and what do you mean my coworkers were almost done eating."" I proceeded to say just cancel my order because at this rate I cant enjoy my food because my party was done. So as she brought the checks she came to me first and tried to tell me the reason I didn't get my food was because I sent it back. So I said why would I do that, that makes no sense, then she told me the wrong item I ordered. I was so distraught, I couldn't eat with my coworkers, I was really hurt and to have my coworkers sharing their meal with me because I was hungry. This is totally un acceptable after being there in total for about an hour and a half I had to go to wendys to get a chicken sandwich because I was hungry.

Vashion M.,"Minneapolis, MN",24,105,100,4.0,3/5/2017,"I like the Cheesecake Factory and have been here many times before.  The food and drinks are okay, and as far as my own personal experience goes, the service has always been on point. I met a friend today at the Factory for brunch and arrived right as they were opening, so there was no wait and I was promptly seated.  It had been almost a year since I was last at the Factory, so when I went there today, I was surprised that the amount of calories was listed next to almost each item.  The calorie count of certain dishes and slices of cheesecake that I had eaten before shocked me a bit!  One certainly does not go here if one is on a diet!  ;)  At any rate, the server was polite, courteous, and attentive.  I ordered avocado toast, which was OK, and some coffee.  I felt the avocado could have been slightly more well seasoned with a little extra lime and salt, but that's just me.  I did enjoy the multiple fresh sprigs of cilantro but not sure why there were radishes included.  My friend ordered an omelette with ham.  She assumed the ham would be cut up and incorporated into the omelette, but instead, she was brought a whole slice of ham on a plate.  She told the server about it, returned her plate, and the problem was promptly rectified, and she seemed to enjoy her food.  The serving, of course, was huge, so she wasn't able to finish it all.   As an aside, one of the fun things I like about coming to the Cheesecake Factory is, if it's your birthday, they will give you a special plate with ""Happy Birthday To You"" written on the plate in chocolate sauce as well as receiving a free miniature sundae with a candle. Bottom line is that I will return here but mostly for special occasions and occasionally meeting people for brunch/lunch. Tip (that most may already know):  When planning to go to CF, go right at the time they open or during an evening weeknight, as it will be less busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina
Kurt M.,"Minneapolis, MN",277,230,3,4.0,8/18/2016,"The impulse to look upon chain restaurants with disdain is understandable. Too often they tend to live down to already modest expectations. That said, on the multiple occasions I've enjoyed lunch or dinner at the Cheesecake Factory, I find them a cut above average. Ordinarily a menu as voluminous as the one offered by CF would be a bright red flag. No place can be all things to all people. Right? While this may hold true in general, and while CF may have an occasional miss, I've found the majority of items that I've tried to be hits. I particularly like the Chicken Piccata (I substitute mashed potatoes for the angel hair pasta). It probably has more sodium than a family of five needs in a week. But it's rich, savory and chock full of mushrooms and capers. It invariably makes for two meals since I end up taking about half of the serving home with me. The other day I ate here with my daughter before a visit to the Apple Store (my next review). She ordered the Vegan Cobb Salad described as ""Crisp Lettuce Topped with Grilled Asparagus, Green Beans, Roasted Beets, Avocado, Cucumber, Tomato, Garbanzo Beans, Quinoa, Almonds and Sunflower Seeds with House Vinaigrette."" It was bright, crisp and filled with fresh veggie goodness. She can be quite critical of commercial salads but pronounced this a winner. She added to it an order of falafel. We both found them to be appealingly crunchy on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside. I've never experienced anything other than cordial and professional service. Iced Tea and water are promptly refilled without asking. Food arrives in a reasonable time frame and is typically at the proper temp. There have been some longer wait times for a table but nothing too onerous. Most recently (on a Tuesday evening) we were seated immediately. This is not a hipster, foodie destination. Nor does it aspire to be such. It really is one of those relatively rare destinations where in my experience everyone should be able to find something much to his or her liking. Finally, of course the cheesecake is very good. I especially like the Dulce de Leche Caramel and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. I also enjoy a very occasional slice of the Chocolate Tower Truffle cake. Extremely indulgent? Yep! Excessively caloric? You betcha! Completely over the top? No doubt. But I rationalize the dessert overload by noshing on it for a few days, pulling a huge slice out of the frig for a few bites at a time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina

Then once we were at the table, it just went downhill. We were seated for well over fifteen minutes with no waitstaff to grab us drinks, bread, or water. When I did ask, which was twice, I was told snidely that ""this isn't my assigned section"", and they walked off. I was livid.

Jody M.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,13,,2.0,6/15/2016,"I've been hesitant writing a review of this Cheesecake Factory as the overall experience has been so inconsistent. However, my last experience, made me see life through Gordon Ramsey's eyes.  The first thing I will say is that the avocado egg rolls were amazing. So excellent job. Most appetizers I've had here have been great.  Yet, unfortunately the main course was anything but. I'll keep it short in saying we ordered our daughter buttered noodles, a nice simple meal as long as it doesn't sit under a heat lamp for too long. By our estimates, the buttered noodles were under a heat lamp for at least 20 minutes. The end result is severally brown, and hard noodles, you can't put a fork in. I am not joking when I say this. Even the person helping our server looked at the dish when they were putting it on the table, paused before putting it down, looked curiously at the dish and then layed it in front of our 2-year-old. A piping hot plate, and dried food.  I thought maybe it would have ended there, but by order of enchiladas were dried too, the sauce was entirely baked into the tortilla meaning: no sauce. The beans had a cooked layer of dryness, and the cilantro rice was so baked on the top layer, I could practically remove the entire layer as it's own cover. I tried one, bite, but it was hard and I couldn't finish it.  My son said his spicy chicken sandwich was okay, except that the spice was inconsistent. One part of the chicken had almost no spice and the other was way too hot for him to eat. While this is an opinion of his, I would agree with him that there shouldn't be so much disparity on a single piece of chicken.  Our server was friendly when she took our orders, but never brought the bread she said she was going to bring, and only showed up once after we received our order. That was to give us a check. When she asked if I wanted a box for the pasta we didn't eat, she looked down at the bowl, and said, ""Oh. Probably not."" I thought about saying something to management, but frankly I've had similar experiences, and was just tired of saying anything.  The cheesecake was of course very good.  End result of my many experiences here: Appetizers are always amazing, service can be great, or shoddy depending on the server, main entrees are wildly inconsistent. Cheesecake is always very good.  Overall, the inconsistency is very difficult as I don't know if I am going to have a nice meal, or a bad experience. I've yet to have an overall good experience, but I'm hoping it does happen.

Sarah A.,"Minneapolis, MN",767,111,386,5.0,3/12/2015,"I love the decor! It is stunning. It kind of reminds me of the mall in Las Vegas with the painted sky ceiling and the dim lights.  Happy hour drinks: J.w.'s pink lemonade: Skyy Citrus vodka, raspberry licqeur and lemonade $5.50 - tasted like watered down lemonade but maybe it's a good thing it didn't taste strong. This is a popular drink that many people enjoy. Margarita: Classic margarita with gold tequila, triple sec and fresh lime $5.50 - this was strong but not too bad! Happy hour appetizers:  Soy glazed edamame $4.95 - I'm not sure why they give you the option of having it plain or with soy sauce. Most restaurants offer edamame with soy sauce on the side. I wish that was the case here but it was good. If I had to order it again, I would take it plain. Portobello mushroom avocado and zucchini fries $6.95 - I liked the texture of it except the fried avocado was not my favorite. I think it was too soft for my preference but the batter was fried perfectly and it tasted very crisp.  Entree:  Miso salmon about $19 - delicious! I only ate half of it and saved the rest for lunch tomorrow. The sauce it as glazed in was sweet. This meal came with a few vegetable peas but I wish it came with broccoli or more. It comes with white or brown rice. I'd recommend this dish at least once to try.   Dessert:  Lemon raspberry cream cheesecake - hands down light, fluffy, smooth, and all worth it! I'm so glad I tried this and I would get it again. It was mostly cheesecake with a lemon cake type of crust.. At least that's what I think I tasted :) Waitress: Tara - hands down the best service I've had in a long time. She checked my birth date on my ID and noticed that my birthday was a couple days ago.

The menu includes tons of choices for starters, salads, small plates, entrees, sandwiches, etc. It's actually too much (for me) and a bit bit overwhelming.  Therefore I tend to stick with the massive burrito big enough to feed four.   This time I ventured out and went for: - Buffalo Wings:  Delicious!  They're breaded, not super saucy or extra dry, and have the right amount of spice.  Therefore no need to worry about your mouth burning.  -Beet Salad: I loved it.

Mom and I went on a Saturday evening, but thanks to our early 5:30 arrival we only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Our server was a young guy who was very excited about everything. We were both a little irked that neither the drinks nor the cheesecake listed pricing on the menu. Mom was more than a little shocked to find out at the end of the meal that her chinsy watered down sangria was $9.50, especially compared to my $5 Sierra Nevada. When I asked him what the price was, he admitted he didn't know. I wanted my Farfalle pasta with sundried tomatoes, roasted garlic, peas, and pancetta. It is so delicious that I do NOT want to know how many calories I just ingested.  Mom asked the server for a recommendation and he had raving reviews for the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish. When they arrived, hers was a huge mountain of rice surrounded by the meat/shrimp. While the flavor was good (mostly just the coconut), she did note that there was no essence of ""bang-bang"" to be found. He got very defensive and snapped he never said it was spicy, and that white people don't understand what spice is. Odd... Our food was good, we were full with little leftovers, but somehow two drinks and two meals added up to over $50. He dropped the bill off with three other tables' tabs also in there which was odd.

Kaprice W.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,39,23,1.0,8/17/2016,"So disappointed on my engagement day!!! My boyfriend suprised me and took me here for the first time after he popped the question last weekend. I ALWAYS wanted to come here but never had the chance. First we waited 40 mins to get seated WITH a reservation. Second of all they brought me the wrong food! I ordered farfalle chicken & garlic which had tomatoes in it and I told the server I am allergic to tomatoes when ordering and on top of that they did not include the mushrooms in the dish which I love mushrooms. I had to send my dish back due to the tomatoes and was told it would be 30 mins to get it remade. Instead of waiting my fiance shared his chicken Madeira which was good but Luke warm when they brought it to our table. The best part of the meal was the calamari, the banana cream and white chocolate rasberry cheesecake. The service wasn't that great either we had to wave down our server for drink refills and waited 30 mins after we were done eating for the check. Sadly this is not what I would of expected for a nice restaurant. As much as I wanted to love this place they did not deliver on a very special, memorable day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=60
T. Allan P.,"Winnipeg, Canada",0,28,4,2.0,4/3/2016,"We only had to wait 30 minutes for a table, but once we were seated (in uncomfortable wicker chairs in the lounge...at a high bar table), it seemed our server was either too busy or uninterested in serving. It took nearly ten minutes just to come over and take our beverage order.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken off of their 'skinnylicious' menu. When it came out, it looked like a couple of grilled chicken breasts in a soup-like sauce. And there were SO many baby tomatoes, it was almost overwhelming trying to find the dish. On the menu, it said it came with a 'green salad'. I can only imagine that that was smothered somewhere in that sauce. I ate the 3 pieces of chicken and tried to eat the tomatoes but they were just so soaked in sauce that I couldn't bear to finish it. For dessert, I ordered the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore cheesecake. It was good - obviously very rich, but just good. The whole ordeal to have our leftovers brought back to us and the bills taken care of us nearly added 15 minutes to our experience. It was just so slow. Food was alright, service left something to be desired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=60

The manager said we could call corporate to complain but that was all he could do for us. Our waitress however was wonderfully pleasant and knowledgable.

Rachael S.,"Watertown, MN",0,5,,5.0,3/27/2017,"My mother and I stopped in for an early dinner recently. Both hosts were very pleasant and greeted us with a smile. I was pleased we only waited about 5 minutes for a table (although even if we had waited longer, it's not the businesses fault that they are popular!). Our waiter was James F. He was extremely nice and prompt when we needed something. He had the perfect server personality, charming but not so charming that you can tell it's fake. He seemed genuinely concerned with making sure we were taken care of and enjoying our meals. The drinks from the bar were excellent and beautifully presented (they used all fresh mint, fruit, etc.). Food was great, including the pumpernickel bread or whatever it was that came free. We got the Cobb salad as an appetizer. The vinaigrette dressing was light but still flavorful and the avocado was soft and ripe. Will definitely order it next time. The cheesecake we took home was also bomb! One thing I appreciated was that we were there for almost 2.5 hours and James never made us feel like he was in a hurry for us to get out of there. I've worked in the service industry for a long time and understand the pain when tables ""camp out"" in your section. I even apologized to him but he assured us that we can stay as long as we want. Granted we did continue to order drinks and dessert so it's not like we were sitting there sipping waters for an hour or anything. I briefly chatted with someone who i assume was a manger of some sort, and he was very personable and outgoing. Overall I was super impressed with our experience! I was shocked to see The Cheesecake Factory only had 3 stars on Yelp, so I wanted to be sure to leave a review. The only thing that i was less than impressed with were the bathrooms. It was a bit unkept and most stalls were out of toilet paper (something that's understandable at 7:30pm mid dinner rush, but like I said it was like 4-5ish). I will definitely be back and will probably request James F!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=60
Jim L.,"Farmington, MN",776,351,8292,4.0,6/29/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to eat.  Nice portions, great food, cool atmosphere.  The decor is fun to look at.  The service is very good and snappy.  The food was simply delicious.   The down side of this place is it is the only one in Minnesota and it is in the Southdale Mall in Edina.  It is difficult to find a parking place close to the restaurant so plan on walking.  Ladies don't wear the uncomfortable fancy shoes that will kill your feet by the time you get there.  The other thing is there is NOT a call ahead or reservation system in place so you have hoards of people crowding the place to wait an hour for a table.  The crowds block the entry, hallways and make this a tough place to go during the prime time eating hours. They definitely need more of these around the Twin Cities.  The food service and decor is a draw, but the lack of parking, long waits and crowds are a real turn off.  Try to plan you meal earlier or later than the normal times and it will be a better experience.  I would stay away on Friday and Saturday nights, it is just too crowded, expect a long wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=60

Ryan S.,"Lakeville, MN",0,39,,2.0,6/25/2015,"We normally love The Cheesecake Factory. The food and the service are usually great. This last time we were very disappointed in the temperature of the plates and the food. After the food runners brought our two kids meals and set them down in front of the children, they told us the plates were pretty warm and to be careful. I immediately moved the plate from in front of my 2 year old toddler and was astounded by how searing hot the plate was. I couldn't even manage to slide it over in front of me without using a folded napkin. My wife and I were both shocked that they would even consider serving children food on a plate that hot. It's weird because none of the food on the plate was very hot. It could have all been eaten immediately if it weren't for the ridiculously hot temperature of the plate.  Shortly after that our food came out, and again the plate was molten red hot magma temperature, but the food was barely above warm.  Seems like a silly thing to get worked up about, but the part that really made us mad was the manager Jennifer Madison's reaction to our concern about the plate temperatures for the kids meals.  She basically insinuated that we were terrible parents for not cutting our children's food and letting it cool before giving them the plates. (Even though HER runners are the ones that placed the plates in front of the children.) She stated that it was either company policy or a health code issue that required them to place all plates for service in the food window before being brought out to customers regardless of food type or age.  (Horse crap. I've eaten at PLENTY of restaurants where I've been served food on room temperature plates... and the food was actually hot to boot.) She gave off an air of indifference. I don't appreciate spending 90 dollars in your restaurant and then being told that our concern was not valid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=80
K S.,"Burnsville, MN",0,17,3,3.0,10/28/2015,"We have been here once before and the food was great! My husband and I went out to lunch today and decided to get a loaded tater tots appetizer. We were happily munching on said tots until my husband found a bolt/screw in the one he just popped in his mouth. Thankfully he discovered it before biting down too hard. So we flagged down a manager, just wanting for them to be informed of what we found in our food. He was very apologetic, took away the plate and asked if we wanted a new one, we declined. Our meals came and as we were eating the manager came and told us our whole bill will be comped. We didn't tell him about the screw to get a free meal, we actually felt bad eating for free so before we left we put down a generous tip ($20) for the server, because it wasn't his fault. We were about half way to our car when the server chased us down to tell us what we put on the table didn't cover our bill so Aaron said ""Talk to your manager. I found a bolt in my food and he said we didn't have to pay"" so my husband followed the server back in and told the server to get the manager. Unreal that the manager didn't communicate to the server what happened. That is the first thing that should have been done was to show the server the plate with the screw on it and to zero out our bill. That way we wouldn't have been chased down like dine-and-dashers.

Sarine J.,"Indianapolis, IN",211,147,86,4.0,8/17/2015,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. I love the decorations, how large the portions are, how unhealthy and delicious everything is, and that the desserts are as big as my face. If you get the apple crisp, it is bigger than my face. When I go to this restaurant it is definitely a treat. I usually order from the skinny menu because I can't get myself to order from the regular menu. Well, that's also because I would rather eat dessert than the main dish anyway. During this visit, I shared the apple crisp and strawberry cheesecake with a few people. As mentioned before, the apple crisp was HUGE. I do think they have cut down on cheesecake slices. I remember them being so huge a few years back, but recently they are quite small and possibly not sharable. I'll be coming back here to treat myself from time to time.

Rachel B.,"Minneapolis, MN",59,126,89,2.0,6/4/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of the few chains I really enjoy. That said, the Southdale Cheesecake Factory is lacking. One problem is simply that this is the only Cheesecake Factory in the state, so the place is always crazy crowded.  You absolutely have to eat here at an off time or you'll be waiting for an hour. The other problem is the service. For the most part, the hostesses and the servers treat their jobs like they work in, well, a factory. They see the customers as products to churn out on the production line as fast as possible before their shifts end. No friendliness or warmth, and they spend as little time at your table as possible, which means that orders get messed up.  Also, one server gave us an extremely nasty look when we ordered a lunch portion to share, even though everyone knows perfectly well that their lunch portions are enough to serve at least two people.   As for the insanely sized portions of rich food that everyone complains about, well, I'm not so put off by that. Yes, I realize that this place is almost a satire of American gluttony, but use common sense, people!  There's no Clean Plates Club at the Cheesecake Factory. Share a dish family style or bring home the leftovers. I did eat an entire slice of cheesecake once, but I was seven months pregnant, and unless ths is the case or unless you are having a VERY bad day, do not engage in such foolishness. Share. Also, order the avocado egg rolls before Michael Bloomberg tries to make these illegal.  These may be more decadent and joy-inducing than the cheesecake, and that's saying quite a bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edina?start=80

Jared B.,"Minneapolis, MN",10,16,,2.0,3/22/2015,"Ugh. This is the ONLY Cheesecake Factory in all of Minnesota, so I guess we won't be going to Cheesecake Factory any longer. We ordered the following: Sausage and Ricotta Flatbread: Solid, although I wish there was a finer balance of sausage to cheese ratio. The sausage looked more ground up than what I'm used to (more like chorizo form). There were large chunks of ricotta, which was nice. Ahi Tuna Tartare: Also solid. I feel like Ahi Tuna and Pork Belly are falling into the same category. Sad day. But, I digress. It's a solid eat. Kale and Apple Salad: Again, solid. Light and airy. I would've preferred a few more of the fruit notes to come through. Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta: Meh. This is what my wife ordered. It's one of her favorites here. But, as we've come across better offerings, like Zelo, it's hard to say this is ""good"" anymore. Large chunks of tomatoes, four shrimp, and some angel hair pasta with a few chunks of garlic. Eggplant Parmesan: Sorry for the person who searched for this on Yelp expecting to find a review of it. I was excited to try this. Placed my order, and was told 15 minutes later that they ran out. The manager apologized but I was bit puzzled why it took so long to tell me. I was set on the eggplant. I couldn't really find anything to replace it. Ever notice that the cheesecake factory menu is mainly just chicken and cheesecake for the most part? I wasn't in the mood for chicken. So I went with fries. You know why I went with the fries? Because our server was just plain bad. She was nice, but just not good. Perhaps she was new? I don't know. Our appetizer plates were sitting on our table for a long period of time, no napkins, no straws, the issue with the eggplant, and the 15 minutes it took for us to actually pay our check. She asked another waitress to clear our table but didn't communicate to her that we had just had appetizers and they took all of our silverware away assuming we were moving on to dessert.

I have been a professional Chef for over 10 years and that would not fly in any of my restaurants. Accidents happen but to have five count it three forks a plate and food in the water glass that I never drank out of.
