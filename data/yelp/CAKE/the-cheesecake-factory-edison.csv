Alcohol U.,"Chicago, IL",208,31,3,2.0,12/29/2017,"Not sure why I bother to review a place that is loved by so many who wouldn't dream of giving less than 4 stars, well not this bloke. I'm giving them 2 and that is being generous. Not sure what staff and managers think at the establishment. Maybe they think Mall traffic, so shitty service and behaviour is ok? That could be one possibility. Food is ok. I'll give them that. Service and attitude needs to change. Clearly. Just imagine, if they weren't at the local mall, what would it be like? Oh, and if you're thinking about ordering a slice of cheesecake to go, make sure you scream as loud as you can because people behind the counter are either deaf, or blind. I'm thinking both. I was always under the impression common sense was a common thing but as time goes by, I tend to think it is all bunch of hogwash! You could be standing there with a credit card out in the hand ready to be swiped trying to order and person behind the counter stares at you like you're there to inconvenience them. My final thought- It's not called mind reading, but more like paying attention to visual cues. I bet they don't teach that at the Cheesecake Academy.  That's all I got!

Esther C.,"Moorestown, NJ",177,21,10,2.0,12/19/2017,"Typical Cheesecake Factory. Usually the staff are quick and kind whenever I go but here they are kind of slow to be honest. It wasn't busy at all when I was here yet it took like 10 mins for someone to ask us for our drinks and another 10 to get the drinks and then another 10 to place our order. Utensils were dirty/water marked on top and the bases were handled by someone who's fingers were definitely greasy. Our waitress was an older lady and she was rude. Every single time we needed something she just ran past us while we asked and she gave us a ""yup!"" Or ""okay!"" I was honestly giving three reviews but I dropped a star just for her. We finally needed the check and while we just said ""excuse me?"" And she was like ""give me a minute"" while she brushed us off. A young group of college students yeah sure but we are paying customers. We are polite and respectful and actually tip a decent amount wherever we go but this lady brushed us and tossed us to the side and it was obvious. All brushing off and you'd think that she would be running around being busy but nope she didn't even bring our food out to us. The two gentlemen who did were kinder and more accommodating than she was.  10% not because we are college students, 10% because you were bad at your job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison
Jackie S.,"Staten Island, NY",110,148,489,3.0,9/3/2017,"This location is on the outside of Menlo Park mall and it's always busy! The wait times can be hours before being seated. However , we were seated right away on a Friday afternoon. My friend and I were seated at a small two seater table that was almost on top of the next table. Felt too close for comfort as I thought the next table could hear our whole conversation. So I asked to be switched to a booth. The waitress then seemed bothered by that. We were off to a good start - we got our drinks promptly. However, the waitress seemed frantic with too many tables to attend too. We had to ask for bread, water, and silverware. She was not attentive at all. Maybe all of three times- to get our drink order, to get our lunch order, and to deliver the food. It seems they may be lacking in staff or could use a few bus boys.  To start we ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes which is topped with sour cream, salsa, avocado and salsa verde. I really wish we didn't order this because I felt like absolute death the whole day after. It's so filling and rich I wouldn't order it again.  From the skinnylicious menu I ordered the ahi tartare which is raw tuna with avocado and a soy-ginger sesame sauce. This was good but it could have used a few more of the chips it came out with. There were only 4. My friend also ordered from the skinny menu she got the chicken lettuce wrap tacos in the Asian style. She loved those.  I used to love Cheesecake Factory but it seems like it's going downhill. The staff is inattentive and seems as though your bothering them. Also the food is lacking in all aspects. It's a no from me Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison
Katrine R.,"Bridgewater, NJ",236,64,124,4.0,8/29/2017,"I'm less inclined to write reviews on chain restaurants, but I felt like this one deserved a review. I had lunch here last weekend and since the weather was so beautiful out, I requested for outdoor seating. You could tell everyone had the same idea because the place was getting more and more crowded after we sat down. Our waitress (forgot her name) was super nice - she took great care of us. Despite the abrupt change of pace, she still managed to accommodate us. I ordered the Thai Coconut-Lime Chicken while my brother ordered the Macaroni & Cheese Burger. First off, let me say that after reading the description for my dish, I didn't really think anything of it. I just knew I was hungry and needed food ASAP. Luckily for me, the food didn't take long to arrive. Looking at my dish, (let's be honest) I'd say it wasn't really an eye-catching type of dish. Presentation could have used some work, but after my first bite, I was taken back!! The flavors on this plate was phenomenal. The portion size was huge! This could have easily been a dish for two people but no complaints here. I took my leftovers home, only to have it for lunch the next day. My brother definitely enjoyed his food as well, he basically inhaled his food to say the least. I wish all my prior visits to Cheesecake Factory were as pleasant as this one. I'm sure all other locations are good too, but I have a feeling I'll be visiting this one more often than the others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison
Amber B.,"Hudson County, NJ",628,278,750,3.0,6/9/2017,"I like the Cheesecake Factory and despite my review (sadly) I would probably visit again (perhaps just not this location). I came here with a party of 7 on a late Friday evening. We got there about 9 and we were told that it would be a 30 minute wait, cool no big deal. In about 40 minutes we were finally seated. Our waitress took longer than usual to come and introduce herself and that was a bit annoying because it was already late. When she finally decided it was time to show her face she only asked us what we would like to drink (and you could imagine she took her time with that too) Also, the famous Cheesecake Factory bread wasn't delivered until we asked.  Our food just as you could imagine took all night just to get to us. Very mediocre to say the least. I ordered loaded tots and they were not at all how I imagined them. The wings were also a let down. If the service was better I would be able to justify some things but the service was a very big let down on this particular night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison
Tiffany M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",248,121,232,4.0,6/15/2017,Hi Yelpers!  This place has been my go to place for my birthday since I turned 21! Though this year finally broke the stretch since I went over to Kona (sorry Cheesecake!) however I still adore this place because of the quality of the food.  Always fresh and very tasty. I'm a huge fan of their pastas! I guess this place also has sentimental value because of my birthday but its a great place. Downside is that it get crazy packed with parking. Terribly. It's shared with the mall and people love this place so never come here on a Friday or a Saturday. Thankfully my birthday has fallen generally on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  Also the cheesecake is BOMB! I just had the coffee swirl something and it was amazing. Perfect combo of creamy cheesecake and coffee---definitely something to sip with espresso.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison

Natalie W.,"South Plainfield, NJ",331,71,529,3.0,4/26/2017,"Came out to the Cheesecake factory for my Sisters Birthday Dinner. I want to give the place a 2 But our Server (Carlo) and Host make it hard to do that because they were awesome.  It's been said to always start off with a positive so I will do that. GOOD- The house Chardonnay is crispy, not very Oaky, $36 a bottle and Wonderful - The server Carlo was very professional -Cheesecake was heavenly AWFUL - When we sat down to dinner all the Cutlery was wet and My 2 Forks had Wet Lettuce on it and Murky water. (HAIR RAISING SCENE), Someone actually set the cutlery in order and missed ALL of that detail  . It was so dark in there someone could have easily not seen the filth  (a child) RIDICULOUS- Immediately asked for the manager (LEO) and after they couldn't find him for 10 mins  (they said he was outside) He approaches us abruptly and in super defense mode .  He looked annoyed took my cutlery and had someone else send new clean one's  over in less than five minutes.  Normally when there is a problem the manager personally comes back to make sure everything is well . Nope not this guy he never returned and passed us several times with no regard. Most of our food came out Room temperature and they have the audacity to have done a recent price increase which is fine if the EXPERIENCE matches the cost. Shame on Menlo location.   Cheesecake and Wine for me only if I return  Thank God for our server who did his best to make up for the lacking experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison

The visit was short, but overall pretty good. We ordered fried zucchini, which we had to send back because it was not cooked. The server offered to redo it, but when chose not to and to just have coffee and cheese cake. After all, that is what we originally came for. It was great. Whip cream is everyone and the caramel coffee was a great compliment to the salted Carmel cheesecake.  I will say that they need to work on keeping the place tidy.

Mike M.,"Manhattan, NY",237,424,309,5.0,3/11/2017,Ive grown to love The Cheesecake Factory. It wasn't immediate but now its real. You too may not immediately come to love this place as there's a hangup that you need to forgive/forget in order to truly appreciate the factory. Be prepared to wait 1 - 2 hours to get a table during a typical dinner rush on a Friday or Saturday which is why I now only go during the week and get a table instantly each time. You may think that its not worth the wait for a corporate franchise type restaurant but I kid you not this place is the $hit!. Ive been to this place well over a dozen times and always leave pleased and extremely full. Their portions are YUUUGGGEEE. My Tip: Sunday through Thursday for dinner.

Jennifer D.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",2007,646,2274,2.0,2/27/2017,"I really cannot understand why this place is so popular, especially this location. My friend had received a gift card (again) for Christmas so hey why not enjoy a free meal :) We went to see a movie and came here after. The wait on a Sunday at 6pm was 40 minutes. We sucked it up because of the gift card and waited. I've been to this location before and there is always a similar wait. There really isn't a great place to wait. There are a few benches but not enough for all of the people waiting.   When our table was ready we were seated by the bar. For some reason the floor was really slippery and greasy. I ordered a coke and was told the bar was out of coke. They had a few new dishes on a special menu so me & my friend decided to order the salad. Our waiter said we couldn't change anything about the salad off the menu. No removing anything!  Not even dressing. So instead we just ordered off their regular, 345 page menu.  We both chose the avocado salad and added chicken. Instead we got a salad with guacamole on top. Not quite the same but nice try. This is the third time we've ordered a dish with avocado and either received little or no avocado. I'm not sure why they don't just stop trying to sell dishes with avocados.  On top of everything from the start of our wait until we finished dinner was almost 3 hours!  For a 40 min wait. Two people ordering salad and 1 dessert. You do the math with all the waiting.  The only reason we keep coming back is because my friend keeps getting gift cards. This place is probably one of my least favorite chains.

AMANDA R.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,45,82,3.0,8/22/2017,"Cheesecake factory is one of those places I go to when I don't know what i want to eat but want to eat good amounts of food. It's sort of a hit or miss. Some meals are great and others not so much.  The good thing about this place, is they have everything under the sun. You want it, they have it. All tucked away in their somewhat of a 20 page menu.  Although I give it three stars I do still dine here from time to time. Some tips: -Try and look over the menu online so you have a better idea of what you'd like. Looking at the menu for the first time seated is overwhelming  -if you're thinking of going Friday to Sunday at night be prepared to wait about an hour. Reccomendations: Garlic cheesy bread to start! It is one of the best I've had it comes out as a loaf of Italian bread and you get to pull it apart and watch the cheese and garlic spill out The Cajun chicken and French fries. It's basically chicken fingers and French fries but it comes with so much. It can be shared between two people for sure and it only cost about $14 The chicken fetucce is very good and tasty.  The burgers are always good I do not recommend: The cheesecake, I know I know that's the whole point. It's not my favorite cheesecake to be honest, it's dense and heavy and doesn't seem to taste fresh. I've given it a few chances but doesn't do it for me. This is for the plain cheesecake I have yet to try other flavors. Although I give this place three stars I do come dine here from time to time, as long as I avoid the long lines during busy hours and know what I'd like to eat in advance then it's usually a good time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=20
Anthony G.,"Edison, NJ",244,48,650,2.0,7/31/2017,"I stopped by last night after Point Pleasant to grab dinner. I was greeted by a friendly host and was told it would only be 10-15 minutes before I would be seated outside on the patio. I joked around with her about free cheesecake considering it was National Cheesecake day. She told me it was half off slices for dine in (no limit) and even joked around about how people should just get a table but are ordering takeout slices and are allowed one slice at 50% off. My table was finally ready after only ten minutes and I was lead to the patio by another host.  After a couple of minutes at the table I was introduced to my waitress and she asked me if I knew what I wanted to drink and if I wanted to order an app. I ordered a water to start off and needed a few minutes to look at the menu. A couple minutes passed and my server was back to take my order; I decided on a side house salad tossed in vinaigrette and the Tuscan Chicken off their Skinnylicious Menu sub brown rice instead of the farro.  She advised me that the serving of rice was going to be small and suggested she bring me an additional side of rice but I was ok with the size of the serving.  About five minutes after she took my order, my salad and fresh bread came out but as I was ready to dig in, I had no silverware or napkin. I eventually flagged down another server, since mine was no where in sight, that rushed to get me utensils and a napkin and he apologized even though it wasn't his fault. So I start eating my salad and not half way through it, my meal comes out. I feel like the timing between the courses were input correctly hence the overlapping. I like to finish the app and then the dinner come out after I've finished.  I'm enjoying dinner but wish I had some more water. 3/4s of the way into my dinner my server comes back and tells me she is going to refill my water and then asks me if I am enjoying the entrée.  At the point I didn't feel like a welcomed guest. To make things even worse as far as the service went, I finished my meal and, no exaggeration, waited 15 minutes before she appeared to ask me if I wanted dessert and/or coffee but she didn't even stop at the table. She acknowledged me in passing as she was heading to another table.  I declined and just asked for the check. Another 10 minutes go by and another server brings the check and at this point I was completely unsatisfied with the service.  I can't believe it took 30 mins after my meal just to settle the bill. I was generous with the tip and come to think of it, I shouldn't have left one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=20

The wait wasn't bad for 2 people, 20 mins which was shockingly fast! Ok for the food part. Ordered calamari and buffalo wings for appetizers. Calamari was good but the chicken wasn't so tender and no spice whatsoever at all. For the main course, ordered a steak diane and herb crusted salmon combination. The salmon lacked flavor in my opinion. As for the steak diane, I ordered it medium well and it came medium with the obvious blood coming out of the pieces of steak.  So i sent it back. By the time I got the steak back, I was already full so I just got it to go.

After a disjointed start where the hostess and waitress didn't communicate well, we had to wait 40 minutes for four people on weekend brunch. We finally gave up on waiting for table and got a seat near bar area. Our food arrived quickly and we felt like we were rushed to eat and get out.  Last but no least, Parking lot issues. It's not their fault that the lot is always packed, but maybe they could learn a thing or two from NYC stackable parking lots (up to 5 cars hoisted one atop the other). noisy atmosphere. cheesecake size was large but at $7.00 a piece it should be.

I've been to 3 Cheesecake Factories in Usa already and I always return with a happy and filled tummy  So my first visit to this chain was a wonderful experience and looking at their expansive menu I knew I had to keep coming back coz I wanted to savour every delicious dish  Friday afternoon lunch time and my colleague and I waited over 20 mins for a table. The restaurant was so crowded, service did get affected. We were brought the bread basket but with only 2 pieces of bread  since they were not able to bake enough to keep up with the demand and guests pouring in. My colleague ordered a drink which was delicious   I ordered the steak Diane and herb crusted salmon combo since I wasn't able to chose between the 2. They did goof up my order and served me shrimp scampi instead of salmon. I realised after 5 minutes and informed another server, they did get me my salmon after 15 mins but by then I was done. Beef steak was so tasty specially with the mushroom, I finished it before the shrimp though seafood is my first love. Shrimp was well cooked but only 3 small sized shrimps were served. The salmon  which I had later at home was delicious  My colleague ordered a veg pasta carbonara which was really tasty.  Their portions (other than combos) are pretty large. To finish off the meal I ordered a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake  wow! This gluten free cheesecake will make you fall in love with chocolate all over again  Overall a good meal though service could've been better. Prices are on the higher side.

I didn't ask for frozen. ... that's all we have.  Well why didn't the waitress say they're frozen, is that okay?   All I could get was ""I'm sorry"".

Scott S.,"Hoboken, NJ",104,213,,2.0,1/6/2018,"I've always been a cheesecake factory fan - fun, pretty good food, awesome cheesecakes...although I'm so curious...why does every single Cheesecake Factory have this unbelievably slippery floor not found at any other dining establishment in the continental United States?  Anyway, back to Menlo Park... I was excited to hit up the factory after doing some holiday shopping - Naturally the place was packed but grabbed a couple seats at the bar. The bartender was so friendly and fantastic. Good start....However, once my lettuce wraps app arrived and i grabbed my little utensil pack, there was like a big piece of lettuce or cabbage or something stuck on the fork that didn't come off in the wash.  ew.  not the end of the world, but still, a bit gross...don't want to be reminded of the mediocre cleaning process that plates and silverware go through before i use them. I ask for a new fork and we are back in business. Everything went well after that - my guiltless tacos made me feel like i was in Puebla, Mexico (well not really, but they were still good). So, after the meal in the holiday spirit, we decided to give our server a cash tip (over 30%) and the rest of the bill on the card. Well well well, what happened next was my real issue with this establishment. Now, if you are someone who views Yelp as just a bitchfest for disgruntled venting customers, look no further, you've come to the right place. So some sneaky little devil at the restaurant decided to add a credit card tip on to the bill, thinking I wouldn't notice it. This obviously annoyed me, but not as much as what came after. We contacted the restaurant to ask for a manger. Manger came on the phone and couldn't give two shits....said he would find out about it and call back (not really caring about the criminal behavior or how this upset customers). After not hearing back, we called again - this time an office manager handled it and said there was no record from the prior manager, and offered a $25 gift card (which would be net $10 after the fradulent tip). okay, just buy your customers satisfaction. anyway, she at least made it seem like she cared..something to the tune of ""im sorry this happened to you"". Needless to say, a gift card never arrived (which i don't really want anyway), because with management like this, it's a reflection of the management of the corporation as a whole, and this lack of integrity probably spills over into other areas, lets say, cleanliness for example.  sooo i'll probably still eat at the factory, but certainly not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=20
Ammara T.,"Bellevue, WA",65,104,56,5.0,10/5/2017,"This is my favorite place for any pasta cravings or homestyle meals. The service is always amazing even though there are long wait times on the weekends, but it's worth it for the  quality. The free fresh bread is always a plus to keep you going before the main entrees. We came here on a Wednesday night so luckily no wait and were taken straight to our table. I ordered the Miso Salmon with Mashed Potatoes and green beans which is an absolute refreshing delight and healthy in some ways minus the creamy potatoes. The best part about Cheesecake Factory is you can customize or substitute almost anything and they're accommodating. My husband got the Parmesan Chicken which is also delicious with Mashed Potatoes and green beans on the side. For our appetizer we ordered the chicken samosa's which are filled with flavor but are quite pricey for $7 for only 4 small pieces but overall yummy! I would come here again in a heartbeat with the extensive menu there's bound to be something to please anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=20
Megan E.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",10,131,20,4.0,5/17/2017,"This was my first time eating at a Cheesecake Factory. This particular location is quite large and spacious. Since it's at a mall, it was definitely busy but we were seated right away at 6:00 PM on a Wednesday night. As we left, the restaurant definitely became more occupied. Our server greeted us within minutes with the soup of the day and took our drink orders. She gave us plenty of time to look over the menu ourselves after offering help. She remembered our orders without even writing them down and repeated to us exactly what we ordered (which I always find impressive of a server). I noticed her do the same thing to a table of 7!  Food was prepared very well. The darker bread (possibly pumpernickel) was fantastic. My dad had a medium rare filet mignon which was perfectly tender and juicy. I had a salmon and steak combo with mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked asparagus.  The cheesecake menu is a little overwhelming only because there are so many! But they did not disappoint! A different server came and took our dessert orders. She was really fun!  Overall, it was a great dinner & I'd come again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=20

The wait was only 20 minutes so I went to the bar which wasn't overly crowded at the moment. I apologized to the patrons sitting at the bar eating because I had to go in between them for my drink. I asked the bartender for the check to pay because my buzzer was going off to be seated, and I stood there awkwardly waiting to pay in between these women just trying to enjoy their meal. I tried getting her attention to pay but she was running back and forth taking care of the service tickets, and I did not want to leave cash there, so I took the check and asked my server if he could transfer the balance to the bill. He questioned why I did not pay at the bar and I explained what happened, handed the check and money to him and he took care of it for me.  The server was great, I apologize I forgot his name (John or JR maybe) and he effortlessly took care of us with exceptional service.

This location is busy but huge so seating is rarely a problem. This time around, I waited 2 minutes for a Sunday night dinner for two. Our waitress was extremely pleasant and attentive despite the many tables she was waiting on and the food was as good as I expected it to be. It was my friend's first time at a Cheesecake Factory and she loved it. We ordered the Eggroll Sampler for an app - such a good selection.

However i must say it is very filling, especially the burgers. Customer service could've been better in my opinion. Only thing i would be beware of is they don't take reservations !

The waiter and manager both came up to me to profusely apologize and told me they looked into the issue (apparently they went back into the kitchen to see if the water used to boil the pasta was too salty or if some other mistake had been made). They suggested another dish for me which turned out great. I couldn't have been more pleased with their customer service.  And you can never go wrong with their Cheesecake for dessert.  Very ample parking as this restaurant is connected to the mall. That's right...I said it's next to the mall.

It wasn't a long wait, we got seated after 25 minutes and we got a very courteous waiter who patiently took our orders and answered our questions. We got the buffalo blasters (pleasantly surprised me)  and fried mac and cheese for appetizers, and I myself got the chicken Madeira for my main course. All of which were spectacular and of course very cheesey (always a plus). I do remember my dad getting the hibachi steak and I tried this- also delicious, sweet and tender. My side from what I remember was mashed potatoes and it had a nice texture. We finished off with a slice of caramel white chocolate macademia nut cheesecake ($8 bit pricey but...) delicious!

I was told there was no reservation under my name at all that morning. The person I was speaking with asked me who I made the reservation with.  Luckily, I had written down that information.  Surprisingly enough... the person who took my reservation was the person I was currently speaking with on the phone!!! I was told they switched the books and may not have effectively transferred existing reservations.   Nonetheless, we arrived and were seated about 10 minutes later.  It took us awhile to get our food which is expected with a large party. Our waiter was switched out which actually may have been a good thing.  Our first waiter was asking if we wanted the potatoes and toast with our breakfast combo (ONLY comes with pancakes, eggs, bacon).  Weird  I'm not sure he actually knew the menu (Who can blame him?  It's like 40 pages!!)  A few of the meals were mixed up but the food was good and overall, my family enjoyed their brunch.

Our waitress came almost immediately so we didn't have to wait too long. The only thing that took a decent amount of time was actually getting our beers/riesling. Bread was hot and fresh!  My friend ordered the Chicken Riesling and I ordered the Skinnylicious Lemon Garlic Shrimp which is supposedly 590 calories or less. Both dishes were paired with angel hair pasta. It tasted delicious. We both ate our food slowly so that we could savor it. Not sure if it's really 590 calories or less or not but it was still really good. And I was full off of half a serving to save the other half for lunch next the next day. Overall good experience coming here at the Cheesecake Factory on a Tuesday night around 8:30 PM. It's nice that they list all of the calories for the menu items which makes it hard to decide which cheesecake is the best one to get since they are all 1000 calories and upwards lol! So i decided to get the banana cream cheesecake to go and spread out eating it over one week. Sooooo good and so happy I got that one! There is a cheesecake which is made with splenda and it is only 600 calories. But I think the funniest thing on the menu at Cheesecake is that you can get a bowl of strawberries for 250 calories for like $7.

She was very friendly and did get everything we ordered correct, which is a plus.

We saw our food sitting under the heat lamp for at least 15 minutes before it was even brought to our table by another employee. While I know our waitress was very busy, since she was running from table to table, maybe they should have less tables, or more help? The food itself was mediocre. While it had a decent flavor, there was nothing special about it all. The fact we got pasta, and it was sitting under a heat lamp for so long, the top already had the dried-out-ness to it.

I order my usual meal, the bang, bang chicken and shrimp. What did I get? Over done chicken and blackened shrimp. Portion, half what is usually served. When I tried to eat it, I couldn't. The shrimp was so spicy it was inedible and nothing like its ever been. I told server what was wrong and she said she would take it back. So far no complaints.  Where it went wrong was when both the server and the manager kept trying to tell me that the food was fine and I was wrong. When I told them it's what I always get and it was not made correctly they kept insisting the problem was with me.  Finally resolved by making me a new plate which I opted to take home since by this time everyone in my party was done eating.  So what did I get? Did I get a full portion? NO I got what looks like leftovers.  The only reason I'm not giving them one star is because they at least chose to pull dish from the bill, which by the way was $250.  For the amount of the check and the fact that I had to insist that the problem wasn't me but their bad cooking, the least they could have done was given me a full portion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=60

Nick S.,"Colonia, NJ",0,3,,2.0,10/1/2017,"Cheesecake Factory To-Go experience: I was patiently waiting for a good 3 min because I understand that To-Go is a busy job to work. However, the To-Go person, Corrin M, refused to acknowledge my existence for an extra two minutes and just kept using the computer. As someone who has worked To-Go at a restaurant before, I understand it's overwhelming but you have to be hospitable to your guests and at least let them know that you will serve them shortly.  Once she finally greeted me she took my order of a slice of Oreo cheesecake and then I waited 15 minutes for it. During the last 5 minutes I saw my slice in the To-GO box on the counter with a receipt on it, just waiting to be put into a bag. I finally got my slice of cheesecake and walked out.  I'm not expecting excellent service from a chain restaurant but I at least want to be treated like a guest. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for 4 years, I just find it disappointing because I would never be rude like that to a customer. -Nick",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=60

I ordered the ""giant Belgian waffle"" with bells and whistles, i.e. Strawberries pecans and ""Chantilly cream""... aka whipped cream, insert eye roll. Friend ordered eggs Benedict with sweet potato home fries. So giant Belgian waffle sounds awesome right? So wrong, I typically am not a harsh critic but this waffle looked so sad. It wasn't crispy, had zero pecans, and some of the worst looking I guess Chantilly cream I've ever seen... plate was dirty. Just unappealing I was too hungry to complain or take a crappy pic. Eggs Benedict... hard poached eggs like just unacceptable. No runny yolk..no.  The bar service was decent and polite.  Definitely the most disappointed I have ever been at cheesecake.

They have a huge portion, so dont over-order! We ordered one pan of pizza, spaghetti, and a avocado -containing appetizer. Overall the foods tasted great. Giant in portion, and a great flavor!

However, when our dessert came, everything went downhill. He brought out a Chris's Outrageous cheesecake. It was definitely delicious until i ate wax/plastic. Supposedly, they use some type of wax to separate the cheesecake on their platter. Well, there was a long strand mixed into the bite I took. When showed to him, he explained what it was and that he would get the manager. No manager came. We atleast thought that it would be taken off the bill... nope.

Jana S.,"Union, NJ",5,7,,1.0,5/31/2017,"This place is horrible. We went here for my birthday and it will be the last time that I will eat here. The staff here don't seem to know how to keep things clean! Okay so first of all, they make you wait 30-45 mins to get seated. I don't really mind that because I am very patient and I know they are packed especially on the weekends. Anyway, when they finally got us to the table, the table and seats were still wet. So we told the receptionist that the table was still wet and she called the cleaning staff to wipe it dry. The unhappy cleaning staff took a dirty cloth (with stains and all) hanging from his apron and wiped the table, then the seats THEN THE TABLE AGAIN. The table was still wet. Obviously he was rushing with all the other tables he has to clean. Then he took the utensils out from his apron pocket and started laying it down on the WET table which he wiped by his DIRTY towel. Then he left. So we gathered all the utensils (that time we noticed some chunks of food on the utensils too which was gross), put them on one side and when the server came, we asked for new utensils. So she got us new ones and I told her not to lay it on the table and get us napkins. She did what we asked but the second set of utensils were still dirty. It also had some pieces of food in between the forks. So we  returned only those that looked dirty and asked for replacements. I wanted to leave but my family was already hungry and it was late so I said okay give them another chance but one more mistake from them and we will walk out. Good thing our server was too good (too good for that place) that she made the rest of our time there okay. The whole time I was paranoid about how my food was prepared and if it was clean. But upon visual inspection, it seemed okay. We didn't get tummy aches after so I guess food was clean or we just have tough guts. I just hope they improve the way they sanitize their tables and utensils and at least wrap their utensils in napkins before they put it on the tables. It's so disgusting.

Instead the server walked away from our table without even saying a word. I would recommend that this young lady learn some common courtesy, you get tipped based upon your attentiveness!

It was quite disappointing - the cake part tasted pretty stale so we just picked out the vanilla ice cream and strawberries.

Alexander H.,"Scranton, PA",1075,586,6680,4.0,11/4/2015,"It's time for a revamp, and my rating will stay the same.  We came on a Saturday night, which was Halloween. Initially, we had plans for dinner somewhere else with a reservation. However, after hearing that there was a 10-15 minute for tables that night only, we decided to cancel our reservation somewhere else and dine here instead. We did that because this place never takes reservations, and waiting times can reach 60 minutes or more on a Saturday night, just like my previous experience back in 2013. After a 13 minute wait, we were seated at a booth. 5 minutes later, our friendly server approached us to take our drink orders. We all ordered water, but I also ordered a ""Flying Gorilla"" (go ahead - laugh) for my specialty drink craving. After a 10 minute wait, our drinks came, along with a bread basket filled with miniature loaves of Honey Wheat Bread and one mini baguette loaf. The ""Flying Gorilla"" was a chocolate-banana milkshake SPIKED with a REASONABLE AMOUNT of Dark Chocolate and Banana Liqueur. I was much more impressed with this shake than the one at Bill's Bar and Burger of Harrah's AC. The shake wasn't too thick, the sweet flavor was great, and the liquor sensation was STRONG. But if that wasn't enough, a mound of whipped cream was placed on top along with some chocolate chips. Be sure to scoop out and eat the chocolate chips when you're finished with this tasty treat. Hey Bill, THIS is a PROPERLY SPIKED milkshake, unlike yours. Highly recommended. The Honey Wheat Bread was topped off with oat pieces. The honey flavor was sweet, and it tasted hot and fresh. The baguette also tasted hot and fresh too. Butter was included with the basket, which enhanced the taste of the breads. Five minutes after we finished our bread, our entrees came out. I had the Chicken Madeira. This was a sauteed chicken breast that was topped with melted Mozzarella cheese and covered with a mushroom Madeira sauce. Also placed on top was asparagus. Mashed Potatoes was served on the side. I could see and taste why this was one of their popular entrees. The sauteed chicken itself tasted great with the seasoning, and the melted cheese and mushroom Madeira sauce only enhanced the flavor. The mashed potatoes had a unique flavor, and it was good. The asparagus tasted fresh. An older woman approached our table and asked me what I ordered. After I told her what it was, she thanked me and said that looks good. I said that it was worth trying.  My dad ordered the Spicy Orange Chicken entree. This consisted of fried pieces of chicken breasts smothered in a sweet and spicy orange sauce. This was served with a side mound of white rice with seasoning on top, and vegetables (snow peas, carrots, etc.) mixed with the sauce. He liked his entree. I tasted the chicken, and it was quite good! My mom had the Hibachi Steak entree. This steak came with Shiitake Mushrooms, onions,  Wasabi flavored mashed Potatoes, and fried asparagus. She ordered her steak cooked medium. She enjoyed her entree. I had a taste too, and the sauce that was utilized for the steak was tasty.  Of course, this outing wouldn't be complete without, well, cheesecake! We ordered two slices to share. The first one was the seasonal Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore. This consisted of Hershey's Creamy CHOCOLATE Cheesecake (without the chocolate cake layers) topped off with a chocolate GANACHE.  On top of that slice was a melted toasted marshmallow, a graham cracker, and whipped cream. An additional mound of whipped cream was added on the side. The flavor was really rich! I recommend this flavor to chocolate lovers.    The other slice was the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. This cheesecake contained white chocolate and macadamia nut chunks, and on top of that was a swirl of caramel syrup and more macadamia nuts. Whipped cream was also placed on top of the slice and on the side. This was good, but a little too sweet.  As what another C.J. Yelper posted in her classic review, eating this by yourself in one sitting can be overwhelming, since the slices are quite big. It's best to share the slices with your friends or family members. If you're alone, just take the unfinished portion home for early future consumption. I keep the rating the same due to the service being on the sluggish side. Maybe you can't rush perfection on spiked milkshakes and entrees, but a 12 minute wait on the cheesecake slices was puzzling.  Overall, this was a very good dining experience. Our server was pleasantly kind throughout the evening. We may consider eating here sometime later on in the future. Even if we don't come back to eat, we'll still grab some slices to go later on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=100
Atiya T.,"Far Rockaway, Queens, NY",20,14,4,1.0,1/16/2017,My First time ever in a Cheesecake Factory and I get stuck with the waitress from hell... she ignored us after she placed our drink order and we had to flag her down for service .... once my order was given she proceeded to tell me they were sold out and walked away as if I didn't want to order anything else. She then dropped us off bread and disappeared yet again. When I tell you I watched her go to every other table as well as sing happy birthday to a table right next to us! This place sucks if I could give them a zero I definitely would. Because of the service here I will never go to another Cheesecake Factory!

Since I haven't had their foods I decided to give this place a try. I had the Ahi carpaccio, salmon rolls, Portabella mushroom, avocado & zucchini fries and Godiva chocolate cheese cake. Service was kind of slow, their bread was good compared to other restaurants where we had eaten before. The food was okay, nothing spectacular. Portions are pretty big. I liked the ahi, but their sauces were too salty..  The salmon roll was meh, I didn't really taste much salmon. The cake was way way way too sweet. I had 2 bites and couldn't eat anymore.

I had to ask for quinoa. It was also underdressed so I asked for more dressing. Luckily I was there for awhile meeting with a friend, but if I was in a rush I wouldn't have been happy with the service at all. Also for almost $11 the salad wasn't worth it.

Anita B.,"Staten Island, NY",0,8,3,1.0,11/11/2017,"Had a scary experience here today. My boyfriend and I went for lunch and he almost choked on a large piece of plastic that somehow got into the bacon and cheese balls we were eating.  The manager did take the food that almost choked him off the bill (wow thanks, for taking plastic contaminated food off the bill)  plastic inside food should never happen.  I feel they definitely could have been more concerned and apologetic. We stayed because we were initially in shock to be honest, he was very  shaken up  (it was huge mistake...... to stay after that.....) the service went down hill from there. If you can believe anything more below almost choking on a piece of plastic. We then waited 30 minutes or more..... for the waiter to pick up the money for our bill and a piece of cake. Worst experience of my life, felt totally disrespected and mistreated as a customer. I will never go back into that place again and will be calling the corporate office and the NJ board of health  first thing in the morning. Plastic in food could kill someone. Imagine if it was a child who ate that? who wouldn't have the sense to know it didn't feel right and swallowed it? My boyfriend almost  swallowed it, let alone a child..... and I saw plenty of children  in there.  Thankfully my boyfriend  started coughing so it delayed him swallowing it  and he realized there was something that didn't feel right before he swallowed it and choked. This wasn't just a simple  mistake, it could choke someone. Extremely dangerous situation. Be careful in this place!!! I worked in restaurants many of them and I'm 32 not a kid, been to tons and tons of restaurants and have never in my life seen plastic cooked into food, with a completely noninterested or concerned reaction from the staff and manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=100

They're simply not good, and very cheap with the amount of fish.  The side of broccoli was plain, steam broccoli, also not very good.  I got the BBQ cheeseburger - delicious if you're a burger fan.  We also got a kids pizza, not bad, but not great. My biggest complaint: We ordered an appetizer that the waitress completely forgot.  She was very nice about it, but still.....

John F.,"Perth Amboy, NJ",0,6,,3.0,8/31/2016,"I have found the food and service at this location to be very good. It is a chain, so of course I don't need to go into details about specific dishes. They are great with substitutions, which is important for me as I'm on a low carb diet, so it's always nice to be able to swap pasta or potatoes for veggies. My only issue with this location is the front desk when there is a wait, which is usually the case on weekends. On my last visit, after asking for a booth for two, we waited and were eventually shown to a table. I said I would be willing to wait for the booth I requested, as we don't like having people taking flash pictures or have screaming babies right on top of us, and asked to be put back on the list and get another ""beeper"", but I was told that wasn't necessary. Then we waited a half hour, and apparently they had completely forgotten about us. My diabetic friend was starting to have a low blood sugar episode, and they forgot about us again. What was supposed to be a pleasant last-minute dinner out turned into an ordeal with a friend feeling ill and in tears. The visit before that had a long wait, and an apparently malfunctioning beeper, so we were never aware that our table was ready. There is a person calling names that are ready to be seated, but at such a soft volume, you can barely hear him even if he's right next to you, let alone among the crowd. Again, I was told I didn't need another beeper, that it would just be a few minutes, and they forgot about us. I don't usually go to chain restaurants, but Cheesecake Factory is quite good and has a lot of dishes that I like. At a quiet booth, the atmosphere is festive and pleasant. But I will probably not return to this location on weekends, or when there is a wait, until the chain finally begins to accept reservations for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=120

Melissa D.,"West Orange, NJ",1,10,,2.0,3/27/2016,"My wife and I were very excited to discover that Cheesecake Factory had a wide array of Gluten Free options since she has Celiacs. However, this location in Edison has clearly not educated their staff on the allergy or maybe the seriousness behind it. My wife is not gluten sensitive- it is not a choice- she has celiacs which means she can not have it.  On three separate occasions she has gotten sick. The first time she ordered the gluten free Ceasar salad, we found out later the Ceasar dressing was NOT gluten free. The second time they brought her salad out with croutons, when we pointed this out they removed the croutons but clearly did not redo the salad. Tonight she ordered a salad again, with a different dressing that was supposed to be gluten free. After dinner we had purchased tickets to a movie where she begin to have an allergic reaction which left her in the movie theatre bathroom throwing up the majority of the movie. It is now 6 hours later and she is still throwing up and breaking out into hives.  So we wasted money on dinner and a movie and now have to monitor her in case she needs to go to the emergency room. When will this be addressed to the staff? Most restaurants who offer gluten free dining do not even allow a waiter or waitress to touch the dish, a chef hand delivers it. This is not a diet fad, this is an allergy that can cause stomach cancer. This is an allergy that can lead to reactions such as hives and difficulty breathing, which is what she is experiencing right now. People with this illness should not have to worry about this every time they try to have a nice night out at a restaurant that claims to understand and offer Gluten Free dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=120

H A.,"Levelland, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2016,"Where should I start? I usually don't post reviews but this was so bad I signed up JUST TO POST THIS AS A WARNING TO ALL. I was looking to host a dinner for about 35 people last week for my 2 children's birthday party, so I went through the proper channels to see if I can make a reservation. They agreed since it's such a large crowd that we can have reservations at 7pm, which worked perfectly for us. They asked us to send in our orders in advance so the kitchen doesn't get backed up the day off, which we did. We have all these communications via email.  Here is where things get messy: I get a call a day before the party and turns out someone messed something up and they couldn't host us anymore. I argued that I have already invited 30 people for a party less then 24 hours later and I can't change everything. They told me the manager would call me. You would think it wouldn't get bad but it gets worse. Joe, the manager, called me back later that day. Talk about unprofessional. He says there's nothing they can do, it wasn't ""his"" fault. I asked if there was anything, maybe even split tables to accommodate. His answer: I can give you a table at 4pm. I asked him who has dinner at 4, and he had the audacity to tell me he has ""dinner at 4pm all the time"". The whole conversation was rude and downright disrespectful.  Long story short, I had to cancel the party. I tried to find other places but with the limited time I just couldn't do it. On behalf of my 2 kids, who just turned 3, thanks for nothing.

Jarrett R.,"Keansburg, NJ",0,13,,4.0,6/20/2015,"Ok. So I have never been to a CF before this visit. I was so impressed with my experience that CF might be my new favorite chain eatery. The service was great, especially for this part of Jersey. The hostess was pleasant,  our waitress, Meghan was terrific, and the whole staff seemed to be really enjoying their jobs. The food was absolutely amazing.  My wife and I eat out often and rarely rave about chain food, but this meal was actually astounding. The plating was expert and the flavors were pure science. We ordered the sweet-corn tamale appetizer O...M...G. Every single flavor just melts together to create the greatest app you have ever ordered!

Belinda L.,"Rahway, NJ",131,153,179,3.0,4/26/2015,"I had been super excited about Cheesecake Factory since my first visit at the San Fran outlet and tried their wonderful red velvet cheesecake. Since then I have also brought my parents to Cheesecake Factory. My dad really liked their pork chops, and their pasta is also great. More importantly my mum loves cheesecake so this is the place to take them.  I was in town recently and stopped by Menlo Park Mall just for some cheesecake. We had wanted dinner here too but they were always busy and on that occasion we didn't have much time to wait. After looking at the shelf I decided on the vanilla bean cheesecake. For some reason the 'wow' feeling is no longer there. The whipped cream was still good, I'd always love their whipped cream, they have a generous swirl with every order of cheesecake.  The worst part was that I got sick after that, and only got better 2 days later. That was the only food I had that my bf didn't for our trip thus far. When some time has passed I would be ready to go back again, probably to try their chocolate cheesecakes.

Margaret Z.,"Manhattan, NY",260,730,78,3.0,12/3/2013,"3.5 stars. I've always been warned about the mediocre food at Cheesecake Factory and now I have experienced it firsthand. Let me preface this review by saying that this is my first time trying CF and that it was still a great dining experience - just nothing to rave about. The ambience here is really nice. My boyfriend and I were seated quickly, as were most parties of 2. The booths looked cozy but instead we ended up in a row of two-seat tables that were squished just a little too closely together. Even speaking at a low volume, there were definitely no private conversations to be had. I didn't expect for the menu to be so... long. There are a TON of choices here but I found myself still having a hard time stumbling upon something I really wanted. I was in the mood for pasta and was surprised that they only had spaghetti dishes - no lasagna, ravioli, etc. I ended up with a lemon chicken and angel hair pasta dish.  We started with a baked potato soup, which I highly recommend. Note: the portions here are fairly large and a ""cup"" of soup could actually be considered ""bowl"" sized elsewhere. My chicken and pasta dish was really tasty but not all too memorable... it was just your typical, average restaurant meal. Ended with the tiramisu cheesecake. As we all know, the dessert at CF is really the star, so no complaints here. I would come back just to eat try every cheesecake on the menu and nothing else.  Service was extremely prompt and friendly - probably the best I've had at a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=180

Adele P.,"Bayonne, NJ",218,571,169,3.0,5/4/2014,"Decent food, large portions, good place to meet up with friends. It gets way too crowded, though. I went down to meet up with friends. For a Thursday afternoon, it was really busy, and it wasn't quite dinner time. I think the worst part of the meal was the other patrons. Yeah, maybe I'm getting crotchety in my old age, but I really didn't need to see the 20-somethings at the next table sucking face during the entire meal. It wasn't just simple kissing, it was full-on, on the table, her in his lap face-sucking. Ick.  Three tables away from them we had the woman who decided to change the diaper of one of her twins - at the table! Double ick. Management really needs to get these Walmartians under control and remind them of acceptable public behavior. I had the catfish. It came with a tartar sauce, not a remoulade, so I don't know why it said it was a remoulade. One friend had gumbo, the other had a steak and shrimp platter. Both seemed happy. Desserts are ridiculous at this place. One was shared by all three of us & there was some left over. I'm not a fan of chains but this wasn't bad.

When I entered the restaurant I didn't hear a phone ringing so I continued to wait to see when I would be answered. Only to then witness the host at the host stand answer my call; again after 10 minutes of me holding.

Christopher K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",878,671,798,2.0,8/14/2015,"I cannot comprehend all the love for the Cheesecake Factory, especially this particular outpost, which fails in almost all categories relative to its peers in other cities. In general, the Cheesecake Factory is a glorified diner, only more fancy-looking and expensive. You can definitely get a decent meal here, but the food is hardly anything to jump up and down about. I generally only come here because its convenient when we get the kids together with their grandparents. I can't think of any diners that can fit 8-10 people in a single booth. Maybe it's because I don't like cheesecake. Maybe it's because I don't care for the decor. Maybe's it's because, despite having a 20-page menu, I can never find anything to order that sounds appealing. I can tell you what it was on my trip here the other day: this location's complete inability to deliver on what I would normally say would be a 3-star experience at best. First off, the place feels worn down relative to other locations. Secondly, all of the food we ordered was served cold. Thirdly, the food we ordered was just not good. This was probably the first time anyone in our party ever ordered a flatbread pizza here, but the margarita version was terrible. Served cold and on a cracker-like bread, the fontina cheese blend was broiled until it was crunchy, and the fresh mozzarella was sprinkled on cold. And ironically we were told that's how the recipe calls for it. Awful. Skip it. I had the spicy chicken soft tacos, which were neither spicy nor were they served even close to warm. And even the sauces and accouterments couldn't save this dreadfully dry and bland dish. The pickled vegetable salad on the side was so bad it was offensive. I could go on, but I will spare you the grief. I try to avoid one and two star reviews as much as possible, but this is just one of those restaurants I've been forced to endure for years and I still don't get why everyone loves it so much. Your best bet here is to order something really unhealthy that comes out of the fryer. In my experiences, this has always been the highlight of their incredibly mediocre offering. Or better yet, skip this chain restaurant and go eat some real food somewhere! I am soooooo done with this place!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=160

They have cajun dishes, cold appetizers, hot, almost anything you name they have it. DRINKS: Their drinks are AMAZING. They are not always strong but I definitely enjoy drinking them. My three favorites are Georgia Peach [MUST TRY], JW Lemonade, and Strawberry Banana Daiquiri.  PRICE: They are not too bad! Expect to spend about 20-40 a person with a drink, entree, dessert/appetizer. Their cheesecakes are definitely some of the best around.  OVERALL: Decently lit.

Steve L.,"Staten Island, NY",2,25,68,5.0,4/15/2016,"Nothing compares to this gourmet chain. Their food, chain wide, is always consistent no matter if you order it in New Jersey or California. I've traveled all over & know what to expect no matter which location I'm in. I can honestly say I love almost everything on their menu. The portion size is alway huge. You get a lot for your money. I've found that if you'd actually like to order dessert, the best thing to do is share an appetizer & a main course with someone. My family & I love the fact that this chain constantly changes out items on their menu to keep the choices fresh, and also to improve already successful dishes, where as other chains stagnate with the same boring menu for years. For starters, we've narrowed down the appetizers to the Factory Chopped Salad, Avocado Eggrolls, & lastly the Buffalo Chicken Strips. We order them without the spicy Buffalo sauce, dry, but love the extra chunky Blue Cheese dressing & the celery with it. For the main courses we always love having the Crispy Chicken Costoletta. It's wonderfully done with a light lemon zest that really sparkles. It's served up with their mashed potatoes & asparagus. A second dish that's a must for those pasta lovers is the Tomato Basil Pasta , it's grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, a touch of garlic and penne pasta that's cooked to perfection, al dente, WOW !!! If you've left some room, any dessert is incredible. You can't go wrong with any choice. In my family (4) of us, we all have our own favorites making it a very hard decision to just pick 1 or 2. Our favorites are: Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake, my wife's favorite. Oreo Cheesecake & the Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake are my children's favorites. Lastly my favorite is the Godiva Chocolate Brownie Sundae. It's a fabulous Godiva chocolate brownie, vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream and toasted almonds with triangular slices of chocolate. Absolutely to die for.

You shouldn't either. Everything else has always been satisfactory. They are a little pricey, but the menu selection is amazing! So many things to choose from!!!

I think thats my only problem with this place: despite having a huge menu ( where each item is over 1200 calories) and adding a ""skinny"" menu, their skinny alternaltive isnt necessarily 'healthy'. They dont have enough healthy options. Anyhow, my friend ordered their tex mex spring rolls and they were good- slightly spicy.. served with an avocado sauce and salsa.

Lauren P.,"Staten Island, NY",54,3,1,1.0,10/3/2016,"@Cheesecake I have visited the Cheesecake Factory since it had opened many years ago and had one of the worst experiences there last night. First of all my fiancé and I ordered a kale salad as an appetizer to share.  It was served to us with zero dressing which caused us to basically choke on the dry kale leaves. But we were hungry from being outdoors apple and pumpkin picking all day so we just attempted to eat it. My fiancé ordered Everlyns favorite pasta without mushrooms, as he despises them as his entree and I ordered the Factory Burger on wheat loaf cooked medium rare. First of all his pasta did indeed have mushrooms in it. But because we have both worked in the food service industry and did not want to make a big deal out of mushrooms we figured we could just pick them out. We are both very compassionate nice people. When my burger arrived , before it even hit the table, I could tell it was severely undercooked. But with further inspection my burger was RAW. I even put my finger into the meat and it was cold and bloody, basically still mooing. I immediately called our lovely waitress over and she took it away and apologized profusely. I told her it isn't her fault but can she please have them remake this because I was completely turned off. She came back several times still apologizing and even said that her kitchen manager exclaimed ""omg no that's not right"" when he saw the severity of how my burger was undercooked. To make matters even worse my side salad that came with my burger was rotten and slimy and contained what looks like a worm or some sort of creature with further inspection of the photo I took of it. We did receive 2 slices of cheesecake on the house but I feel like the Cheesecake Factory company needs to know that something is a wry at this Menlo Park location. A few years back there was a cockroach in my food at this same location. But I believe in second chances ..and I think this past experience was my last visit to Cheesecake Factory. I am disgusted and turned off. Shame on the cooks and kitchen staff at Cheesecake Factory. I fear that in the near future customers could contract food poisoning and/ or Ecoli due to the nature of the ingredients and the rotten not fresh food. I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=200

We went at about 11:30 to avoid the probable lunch crowd. We were successful in avoiding the crowd but the food took over 20 minutes to come out.  Once it arrived the nachos were cold? How in the world does that happen.  The only other cooked component of our entire meal was a chicken breast. Obviously an issue on the line.  Our waitress took them back immediately and returned quickly with them piping hot.  They were delicious this time.  Except for the sour cream and guacamole that they left on when they heated them.  My wife had the beet and goat cheese salad and like I said the lettuce wraps.  Loved them both.

The only MAJOR downfall for me is the wait. I have always had to wait over 30 minutes (usually 1 hour or more on Thursday-Saturday nights) for dinner on any night of the week. You also have to waste 15 or more minutes just looking for a parking spot. Otherwise, the service is ok and it's not too loud so long as you're seated away from the entryway.

Robert A.,"Rocky Hill, NJ",5,42,14,2.0,1/19/2016,"I want to thank the staff for the memorable experience this past weekend.    The 40 minute quoted time for a table allowed me to spend 85 minutes with friends standing and having to learn to dance around the folks moving from the bar or those coming in for to-go service.    Thank you to the server who allowed 30 minutes from the time we were seated to the time we had our drinks.   If it wasn't for the long wait for the sub-par unsweetened ice tea I would actually think about how bad it was. I've waited so long, I can't help but feel how amazing this tastes and how thankful I am to have it.  Sweet and Low please?  Thank you to our server to stop when I asked him to as he was busy running from table to table.  ""Appetizers will be out shortly"" code for - once we get them in the over / fryer that is.  Clearly 40 minutes after we place the appetizer order you would think they would be out shortly.   Thank you for the kitchen staff for promptly giving us our meals and for our server to not check on us once they were brought out.      Not wanting to choke on my dried rice, I am still holding tight to my ice tea, as I know it would not be refilled any time soon.  I could have died and the server would not have noticed. Asking for to go containers required a 20 minute wait. Are they so eco-friendly that they physically make them as needed in a separate rood in the back? Containers are they as sacred as the eternal spirit of a enlighten cow in a foreign eastern country.   Let us pray they come out quickly.  Planned Cheesecake.... in which you eat 1/2 in the restaurant and 1/2 a later time requires a sacred to-go container.  In which we were told no we can serve the cheese cake you plan to eat only half here in to go containers.  Okay make them to go and we will just eat them here anyways and save the 20 minute wait for the containers.   The Land Before Time - in which would-be orphaned dinosaurs seek food and nutriment so they can reunite with their families, only to be told by the guardians ""I'll be right back"". No Cheesecake Factory I don't think I will be right back.  Your mediocre food presented in a dimly lit room of dust covered dated opulence doesn't mask the greed of corporate. Servers costs a restaurant $5 per hour, bus boys cost $8.  They were quick to clean our table to get the next group seated once we left.  I'm confused by this logic.   More servers orders go in quickly and delivered and we spend less time at the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=140

Richard C.,"Groton, MA",84,135,42,1.0,12/26/2015,"Worst restaurant management ever!  We waited over 40 minutes for a table only to have them attempt to seat us at a table with no chairs.  They then spent 10 minutes running around the restaurant trying to find chairs and did not return.  During that time we asked the staff if we could sit at the just cleared booth across from where we were standing.  The staff we spoke to said is was okay for us to sit there.  So we moved to the booth. Then the manager, Andrea, came over and said that we were not allowed to sit at the booth.  She said that we needed to go back to the table that they attempted to sit us at originally.  She then accused us of just seating ourselves and said that we were not allowed to just seat ourselves.  Keep in mind we asked her staff and they said it was okay. Having a manager come over and attempt to undo something that her staff had done to rectify a serious mistake on their part is unbelievable.   Probably the rudest thing I have ever seen.  She then acted like a dictator and said that her staff is not allowed to make these types of decisions and that we needed to come to see her.  I said that we informed her staff that we had an issue and that they said it was okay for us to sit in the booth. If their staff are unable to make those decisions they should be told that they cannot do anything like this without checking with the manager.  We would have been happy to wait for the manager to come and rectify the situation if their staff had informed us.  That is not what happened though. The problems continue when the manager returns and starts arguing with us saying that we didn't accept her previous offer to move back to the original table.  She then offers to move us to a different booth and saying that if we wanted a booth that we should have just asked and just not taken the booth.   This person obviously doesn't get it!  We didn't care about the booth.  We just wanted to be seated and not be standing at a table in the middle of the restaurant for ten minutes.  She then continues to accuse us of taking the seat and arguing with us over details rather than trying to rectify the problem. We asked for her business card and we informed her that we would be writing to the CEO.  She said fine!  Of course she does not return with her business card.  She returned with her general manager's card, Raymond Day, and then said that he stands by her and that it does not matter what I say.  Really! I hope the CEO of Cheesecake Factory sees this and reprimands their management.  If they don't, they will see the letter we will be sending them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=140

I had done my homework and had a pretty good ideas what I wanted to order.  With that said, lets get down to the nitty-gritty. One less star was for the long wait between our appetizer and dinner order. In addition some missing ingredients and it was FREEZZZing where we were seating. 4stars is generous coming from me.  We ordered fried calamari and the sweet corn tamale cakes. Both dish phenomenal.  The calamari was so tender. Truly amazing! Then I ordered a Cobb salad which is supposed to have the crunch of bacon bits and hard boiled egg. Those two ingredients were surely missing. I could not see, taste or smell it! lol Other than that the salad was good but I would not call it COBB salad. The kids had burgers and they were quite happy so were we, that they were happy. Finally, the kids shared a chocolate moose slice which when I tasted it was also delicious.  What would be the point to go to the Cheesecake Factory without getting a slice of cheesecake which we took home to have it with our espresso on Sunday morning. I have to say it sure was good to have it this morning instead of last night! I enjoyed it immensely with my espresso.  I'm impressed with this high end fast food restaurant!

I have probably been to this Menlo park location about 20 times since it's opened. It's a pretty good spot to eat even though it's a chain and I am really not a fan of them. The atmosphere is actually pretty incredible. If there weren't a sign on the wall and people weren't dressed like they just came from shopping in the mall it could probably pass for a high end restaurant. Super high 30-35ft ceilings and great lighting make it very enjoyable to dine here. Appetizers/small plate:  Soy-glazed edamame is a super light fantastic tasting dish, it's sweet and smokey with just a little spice. Fried Mac and Cheese is always consistent and one of my favorites, if they made a normal dinner portion of this I would definitely order it. Tex Mex Eggsrolls, I have had them twice and although the one time they were excellent the second time the chicken was bland and tasted like it was boiled. Pasta carbonara, a very filling and heavy dish. It tastes delicious however it sits in your stomach like you filled it with cement. Chorizo and Avocado omelette, I have had this several times and it doesn't disappoint. It's made with a chicken chorizo. Chicken and Biscuits were delicious although super filling (as expected) the buttermilk biscuit in the middle was pretty fantastic. Cheesecakes: I'll let you be the judges, some are extremely sweet to the point where it made me cringe lol but they are very good.

May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",433,575,457,4.0,4/7/2013,"One word: LOVE. The only one negative thing I can say about it is during the peak dinner hours over the weekend, it's very hard to get a table. The best thing to do is make a reservation beforehand or stalk the bar and wait for someone to leave. I did that the last time and it saved my boyfriend and I an hour wait for a table. So, plus 1 for being 21 and older! The ambiance: Very nice. Overall, place looks great and has a nice feel to it. It is rather dark in there. At first, I thought it was to hide how their food looks, but I've sat in the outside area a few times, and I must say, with or without light, the food looks and tastes great. The food: Delicious, just delicious. They have a HUGE variety of dishes to choose from, so I can't speak for the entire menu, but everything I've had their is magnificent. To start, their best dish is Chicken Bellagio. It's a tasty pasta dish with breaded chicken, arugula, prosciutto and angel hair pasta dipped in pesto sauce. I must have died recently because this dish tastes like heaven. Their Penne Vodka is also very good. Sauce just hits the spot. I've had their Country Fried Chicken Sandwich here and man is that sandwich big! It was hard to eat, but the chicken was fried perfectly and the chipotle sauce was just the right amount of kick. As for the dessert, the cheesecake is amazing. It's rare that I usually get it because I can't even finish my entire entree, but when I can fit it in, I give it an A+. The price: For the amount of portions they give you, it is totally worth it. As for their drinks, a bit on the pricey side. I didn't try any of their signature drinks. I stuck with a classic Blue Moon, but it costs me like $6. A Blue Moon is not worth that much, in my opinion.  The service: This depends on what time you're going here. When it's not as crowded, they come by more frequently to ask about your meal or refill your drink. However, when it gets really busy, you might see them once throughout your entire meal (not including them taking your drink/meal orders).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=240

I'm not sure who gave them design tips, but who decided to design the place with Roman columns next to a Pharaoh's head, accompanied by random frescos? Completely reminds me of the episode of Simpsons when the family travels to Japan, and they eat at...Americatown :P Anyway, on to the review - the menu: B. reflects their schizophrenic nature. It's 20 pages long, covers multiple cuisine styles, and has ads on the back of each page.     - Nachos: B+. LARGE. A bit oily. I heart nachos.  - Sonoma burger: B-. This is mostly because I didn't like the honey mustard dressing they put on it. I mean, come on! The only place I like honey mustard is in chicken mcnuggets.   -Smokehouse burger: B+. This is much better. Perfect smoky BBQ sauce, with a topping of crispy onion strings. The fries are perfectly crisped, but a bit too salty. I personally don't think it's worth $10.95, but I guess someone has to pay for their interior design fee.   - parking lot: C. It's not their fault that the lot is always packed, but maybe they could learn a thing or two from NYC stackable parking lots (up to 5 cars hoisted one atop the other). - yes I know it's cheesecake factory, but I can get their whole pie from costco at a fraction of the cost.

Our server then came and handed us the menus and asked if we would like something to drink. He never stated his name or made any recommendations or spoke about the specials.

The wait sometimes is frustrating even if you're here early there are already parties that showed up way ahead of you.   Food wise, I think the place needs to give some freebies because the apps are pricey almost as much as entrees.  The entrees also leaves out a lot of things such as bread, salads, or complimentary sides.  You gotta pay for all of that so in the end it cost a lot to eat at this place and you don't really get that much in terms of value. Steaks here are ok, maybe mouthwatering because you waited like over an hour just to sit down, order, and you're starving by the time the food gets here. Some other dishes like pastas are a waste of money here, had better for less nearby.

Hunny M.,"Staten Island, NY",1,61,7,2.0,8/11/2015,"I've been to this place several times & the food is your typical chain restaurant fare, all salty & greasy as hell. Very limited options for anyone trying to eat even moderately healthy.  The service is usually not too bad, but I've always gone before the big dinner crowd hits.   I recently went on a Monday at about 430 pm, with a party of 3.  At that day & time, the place was less than 1/3 full. I asked the host for a booth & he seated us at a table. When I pointed out the many available booths, he replied that those are for larger parties before walking away. I got up, went back to the front and asked a different person to be seated at a booth. For her, it didn't seem to be an issue, aside from a slight eye roll. Once seated however, the service was fine.  As for the cheese cakes--this restaurants claim to fame--they are ok. Just ok, you ask? They have many different varieties, all very appealing to the eye, but my experience has shown that the fancier ones are very disappointing. One example is the key lime cheesecake. It combines two of my favorite desserts, so I was really excited to try it, but it was a huge let down--sickeningly sweet & not much other real flavor. Ditto for the Oreo cookie variety.  If you do get cheesecake, I think the simpler the better.  This place also gets super loud, even during times when it's not packed. Not sure if it's the acoustics, (high ceilings & marble tile through out) but if noisy places are an issue, be mindful.  For your typical chain restaurant grub, I find the prices pretty high. I don't mind paying for high quality food, but the food is on par with a TGIFs or a Chilis.

It's been difficult for me to find places to indulge without worrying about my allergy so when Cheesecake Factory game out with options, I was so excited. If an establishment goes as far as to boast about its allergy accommodations, one would assume this would be a monitored issue. The staff is clearly uneducated in gluten allergies because I have been there 3 times in the last 6 months and have had an allergic reaction each time. It is the responsibility of the manages and corporate to educate the serves. Allergies are a serious issue, and as someone who suffers from food allergies, this negligence just won't do.

This location is better than the other locations I have been to. The service is great and they usually try to accommodate any special requests or substitutions you need/want. Only reason it's 4 stars is because although their food is always consistent and on point, their service and cleanliness is sometimes not. The napkin(s) at our table were dirty and filled with lint and dust, that was very disturbing to look at. We shared a waitress with the table next to us, and for some reason they were offered Parmesan with their pasta, but we weren't asked, (first time it had happened, and not sure why) the server might have been too busy running around and forgot to ask or might have thought the runner had already offered it.

Waited 60 minutes, went back to the counter and was told that it would be another half hour. Also, the pagers don't work outside of the restaurant so we had to stand inside the cramped waiting area. Waited the half hour, at this point it is 10:30. Went back to the counter to point out the empty table for 5 that had not been filled for 20 minutes. The hostess turned around, pressed the button to call our pager and then told us that we were being paged right now. Our waiter and food was perfect.

The dessert menu is also quite extensive, although it is mostly cheesecake. My favorite cheesecakes are the Godiva, key lime, pumpkin (only available in the fall), and vanilla bean. It's quite sizable and comes with two scoops of whipped cream.  I've tried many things on the menu, although I can't remember most of them now. The dishes weren't very memorable, but none were too terrible either. One of my favorites is the tuna tartar salad. Also recently I ordered the steak diane, which came with a mushroom sauce served with onions and mashed potatoes. I thought the mushroom sauce was delicious.

Sophia C.,"Marlboro, NJ",222,121,110,3.0,10/1/2012,"I had avocado rolls, which were and always are fantastic. Fried cheese pieces (sorry I forgot what they were called) they tasted mostly like fancy mozzarella cheese sticks in triangle form. They were yummy, but then again, it's not hard to go wrong with that, right? Then I had the wasabi-crusted ahi tuna entree that the waiter recommended. I loved the wasabi crust, it had a mild taste of wasabi, and was fried crispy good. BUT THE FISH. :( What a let down. I really enjoy eating cooked fish in general, I enjoy salmon, tuna, tilapia, deep sea bass, flounder...and also eating raw fish, I enjoy most sashimis. BUT, this fish had a very strange flavor and texture. I don't know, maybe I just don't like ahi tuna...or they cooked it wrong? Hrm. Who knows? I just gotta try it again somewhere else.  The water with lemon was surprisingly bad. I know that most restaurants use tap water for their water as it is free and the ice usually hides the ""tap water"" taste, but nope. Not here! I get water at almost every restaurant I go to unless I am craving a specific drink. I would think that cheesecake factory, since it isn't a cheap restaurant, would at least make sure their water tastes okay. The onion ring was not good and the fries were mediocre. Now, onto dessert! MMMM! I got the kahlua cocoa cheesecake and my friend got the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake. DELICIOUS! I have absolutely no complaints about these cheesecakes. We also got nice large cappuccinos to go along with them. I appreciated the cappuccinos because they were frothy, in between warm/hot, and huge. I was very satisfied with the dessert.

I have dined at the West Palm Beach Cheesecake Factory  location many times and had wonderful experiences there. My boyfriend had never dined here so tonight I decided to take him out for my treat. Sundays is our day together so we always go out to eat and see a movie. I am a server myself so I know better than most how difficult this job can be. Our server tonight was Juan. He did greet us promptly but when I asked if they could serve a Miami Vice cocktail, which is just a combination of two drinks already on their menu, he said they couldn't do it even after I explained to him what the drink was. I ordered a Pina Colada instead and my boyfriend ordered one of  their margaritas. Instead of bringing our drinks together,  he brought my drink out and then my boyfriend's drink five minutes later. He took our order when we were ready. I then informed him that we only had one setting of silverware for the two of us. He said he would be right back with it. Our app came out but we still only had one set of silverware so we had to ask our food runner to bring us a set, which he did right away. We finished our app and recieved our dinner. All the food came out fantastic. While eating my boyfriend finished his first drink and put it on the end of the table. Juan passed by his empty glass three or four times and proceeded to sit with another of his tables directly behind us. He sat with this table and talked with them about how boring his job was and how he didn't want to go inside because "" then they will make me work."" This table then asked if he had any other tables to which he responded ""no, i don't really have any other tables."" All this while my boyfriend sat there with an empty drink and would probably not even have gotten silverware if it had not been for Juan's coworker. Finally my boyfriend called him over to ask if he was still our server and if he could have another drink. Without any apology my boyfriend recieved his second drink fifteen  minutes after finishing his first. The rest of our dining experience felt rushed; Juan came over a few times to ask if we wanted our food wrapped even though our drinks and plates were still 3/4 full. In the end, our bill was $108, I left an $18 tip for our horrible service and called it a night. Should have gone to McDonald's instead. Very disappointed tonight, especially from a fellow server's standpoint. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt which is why I still left a decent tip but in my opinion I would have been better off getting take out. Management needs to make sure their servers are happy and want to be there. I found out this server has been there for about a year and that blows me away. If you are not happy and don't want to do the work that your job entails,find another job more well-suited for you, Juan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=340

A few years ago, I would have given this place 5 stars. I loved the ambience, loved the huge food selection, loved the taste of the food. Recently, the quality has just gone downhill. Last time I came, I ordered the Chicken bellagio and it tasted like someone accidentally spilled an entire salt shaker on it. I also ordered Avocado eggrolls (still a personal favorite) and they were sold out.

Anthony C.,"Holmdel, NJ",9,80,,4.0,8/29/2012,"Very classy interior as most cheesecake factories are. It wasn't all that busy, since I went as a group of four during a weekday lunchtime. I really love the pumpernickel bread (the brown colored bread with oats on it), the guac and chips were ok, everything pizza was ok, and the farfalle was good. Main reason why I added an extra star is because of the cheesecake. It's a bit pricey, but I really adore cheesecake, even though it is a bit pricey. Over the course of the day, we had 2 of the special oreo cheesecakes, the coconut chocolate, and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, all of which were rich and fluffy :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=340

We ate outside, mainly because it's too noisy inside.  Outside was great except there was a water drip from the gutter on the building (it hadn't rained in a while).  Since there were only two of us sitting at a table for 4, I was able to move.  However, if there were 4 of us dining, I would have asked for a different table.  There was food on the ground, so I guess they only clean at the end of the night.  It wasn't too bad, just noticeable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=340

roderick A.,"Jersey City, NY",188,768,308,3.0,6/15/2009,"This was the official opening of Roderick's 2009 Chain Restaurant Tour, and what an opening day it was. This was my very first time at a Cheesecake Factory and what a way to break my cherry (more on that later).  The great thing is that Cheesecake Factory takes reservations, so hopefully that will help future diners. And good thing we had one, because when we got there, on a lazy Saturday afternoon no less, the wait time was an hour.  So we only waited about two minutes before we were seated.  Before ordering, I got text message upon text message suggesting what I should order. I got Baja Chicken Tacos, a Crabcake sandwich, Shepherd's Pie and other ideas. Instead I ordered the ""lunch sized portion"" crusted chicken romano, which is breast of chicken coated with a Romano and Parmesan Cheese Crust, and served with Pasta in a Light Tomato Sauce.  I can't even imagine what the regular sized portion looks like, because my entree was so huge it would make Oprah Winfrey full - that's how big it was.  And of course, since this is Cheesecake Factory, I ordered a cheesecake. But not just any cheesecake, mind you, but the Oreo cookie cheesecake. That's right, because a cheesecake just isn't enough for me I had to get one where every bite contained at least 200 dozen Oreo pieces, it seemed. Need I say it was the best part of the meal? No, I don't think I do. And yes, it had a cherry on top, thus my breaking the aforementioned cherry. And because this is located at Menlo Park Mall, you can walk off all the calories you just gained by shopping inside one of the better malls in the Dirty Jerz.

One answer to this puzzle is their very large menu.  Everyone can get something they like, from salads to pizza to seafood to steak.  When you have a family of people with eclectic tastes, this becomes the choice that no one really objects to and we end up going there. It is totally redundant to say the reason to go there is their cheesecakes.  They are excellent.  Except when you're trying to watch your calorie intake.  Go there for their cheesecake, compensate by having a lunch-sized salad and come back happy.  Better yet, share the cheesecake with someone you love!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=360

Be warned that this place is very popular, so you'll wind up waiting a bit if you go at a peak time.  Good thing is that there's a nice bar/waiting area where you can chill with a drink while waiting.  The waitstaff is always courteous and often engage you in friendly conversation in addition to serving you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=360

I had tortilla soup, which was different, but very good.  I also had a Thai peanut pasta, which I really liked.

Jason C.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",79,488,10,3.0,8/3/2009,"First of all - CALL AHEAD FOR A RESERVATION. There is ALWAYS a long wait. 30 minutes at least, and regularly well above 1 hour. Parking can take a while. Sometimes they offer valet. Food - generally I find their food tasty. Pasta dishes come in big servings, others are average to above average. I think the items are on the expensive side. Pasta dishes in the mid to high teens (and usually come with some form of protein) and protein centric dishes reaching up to the high 20s. They do have some cheaper options in the low teens, and some of their burgers start below 10$. I can't say I've ever had a bad meal here.  The cheesecakes - are expensive. About 7$ a slice. They're big and heavy enough to split with someone else, but you might not want to. They have so many different varieties that you will want to try more than one.  Specifics: Carrot Cake - very good. The carrot cake and the cheesecake is swirled together. It's very most with the right kind of carrot cake spice going on. Special Edition Red Velvet Cheesecake - layer of cake/cheesecake alternating. Cream Cheese frosting. Very good if you like red velvet cake, nothing special if you don't care. Avoid - appetizer - buffalo blasts. They kept falling apart and it felt like you didn't get much chicken under all that fried stuff. Just go with their regular boneless buffalo chicken. dessert - godiva brownie sundae - the ""brownies"" are super dense, cold, and not very sweet or tasty at all (this is from someone who likes his chocolate on the dark and bittersweet end of the spectrum). Atmosphere - this is one thing that consistently annoys me. It looks nice enough with it's high ceilings and dark wood decor. I have never been when it was not very noisy and crowded + some of the booths have very wide tables making it hard to have a conversation.

Anyway, to start off they had very few vegetarian options besides the typical veggie burger which vegetarians get tired of real quick. I opted for the huevos rancheros and asked if there was any meat involved even though the menu didn't mention meat in the entree. The waiter did come back and informed me that the black bean were prepared with chicken broth. The black beans were a big part the entree but I still ordered it without the bean because there was nothing else on the menu that appeared to be appetizing without being overpriced. I was not paying $18 for a salad!  It may have been because I had no bean on my eggs but my meal was only OK. The salsa was pretty bland. Before we got our food the waiter did inform us that it taking a while because they overcooked my eggs...at this point I knew what I was going to get wasn't going to be great.  My friend ordered some salad off their low calorie menu and asked for salmon as the protein. She nothing to rave about her food. It was nice to look at though... The slices of cheesecake were huge so we decided to split a dulce de leche. That was pretty good and satisfying.  I have to say that our first waiter was a sweetheart! But we didn't even have him for our entire time there because he got switched into the dinner service. This place may be good to come just for the variety of cheesecakes but for me it's just not worth the trip. As far as the food goes, save your money and just stick to the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=380

Kristine M.,"Fords, NJ",18,38,152,4.0,2/4/2011,"I would give this location 5 stars just for the Customer Service we experienced today, however, there are items on the menu that could be improved. We arrived at the restaurant at 4pm on a Friday and there was no wait. The server Brittany was excellent. She had a very pleasant demeanor and since we ordered a drink we've never had she offered a replacement if we weren't satisfied with it. She came over and apologized when the complimentary bread was delayed being served and checked on us frequently enough that it was appropriate and wasn't intrusive.  Menu choices range from American, Southwestern, European to Asian inspired fare. There are numerous choices on the appetizer list and entree section that it may be a chore for someone with simple and less adventurous tastes. My suggestion for an appetizer is the Tamale Cakes topped with avocado and salsa verde.  The artichoke dip was tasty, but could be creamier and the chips could be softer. The Avocado Chicken Club is my favorite sandwich with buttered and toasted sourdough bread, grilled chicken, melted Swiss cheese, avocado & BLT. It's my go-to choice if I don't have the patience to be disappointed with a ""new to me"" dish. The sandwich halves are large enough that you have to open your mouth like a snake unhinging its jaw and as an improvement the chicken slices could be thinner. The Passion fruit iced tea could be sweetened since it is a bit bland.  The restaurant also offers a new combo Red Velvet Cake topped with Cheesecake which is tasty. However it could be improved if it did not just have white chocolate shavings and instead topped with icing similar to that of a traditional red velvet cake.  As with any restaurant there is always something that could be improved depending on individual tastes, but at the Cheesecake Factory there are enough choices to satisfy the pickiest eater.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=380

But, with reservations and the fact that this Southern boy got a bit confused on Northern road design, our party was already seated by the time we arrived.  The portions for the Cajun Shrimp Jambalaya Pasta were gastronomically hearty, even the side salad could've been consumed as an entree dish.

There were several vegetarian options and you could also get the non vegetarian options but without the meat; unlike other restaurants, the Cheesecake Factory is very accommodating.

V V.,"Edison, NJ",1,38,,4.0,1/15/2014,"Having been here quite a few times, I will say this place is very good overall.  Pros: + The ambiance is always nice and fresh, giving an upscale yet approachable vibe to it.  + Love the ceiling decor and comfortable seating + Very diverse menu, including options for those who are watching their weight. For the health conscious I recommend the flatbreads (yum!), for the more free-going/cheat nighters their pastas and sandwiches are awesome.  + Cheesecake. Lots of different kinds of cheesecake in lots of different flavors. Need I say more? + Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. Deserves it's own spot and own post lol. It's THAT good and highly recommended for Cheesecake Factory noobs ordering dessert for their first time. Very delicious.  + Service has always been quality when I've come. Attentive, friendly, even the hosts are great.  + Clean bathrooms Cons: - Always a wait to get in, especially during holidays, nights and weekends. Be prepared to wait at least 20-45 minutes for a table - Some of the seating is crowded. You may wind up sitting right next to another family if its particularly packed - You will gain weight coming here. Cheesecake Factory is generally focused on upscale comfort food.

The manager accidently came over to ask us about dirty silverware , but our issue was the not being given appetizers we asked for and were left starving empty table - not even bread  for 45 minutes .. not the silverware (they gave the other table dirty utensils and then didnt come back) but obviously that waiter was serving so many tables insuffieciently and leaving us all hanging. I saw him zip past me several times to take birthday photos for some one, serve others  and people had such a hard time getting his attention. When he finally came he told me that he hoped the service didnt affect his tip and that it was the kitchen's fault. At that moment it became apparent to me he must have cheesecake for brains.. DONT ASK ME FOR A TIP.. BITCH!!! I understand its nice to tip and always do, but I thought it was extremely tacky to ask.It was also lame to throw his team/establishment under the bus.. he should have held it together in front of the customer  which was me.

There is always a wait because there is so many people. The hostess was very friendly and smiley. She told us the wait would be at least 50 mins.  Our waitress was great and gave us excellent service. She was patient and quick. The warm bushman (brown) bread is delicious with butter. We were able to get a second basket of them!  For our appetizer, the buffalo wings were dry and did not taste good. I would not order them again.  There was 7 of us and we ordered 4 entrees. This was more than enough for us! I really enjoyed the ranch chicken salad. It includes a pile of chicken, diced tomatoes, sweet corn, ranch salad, black beans and topped with fried onions. Bang bang chicken and shrimp was a hit. It is a thai influenced dish with your choice of white or brown rice in the center surrounded by coconut curry sauce and chicken and shrimp. The 2 misses were the fettucine pasta with sundried tomatoes and fish tacos. The pasta tasted very bland and needed more sauce. The corn tortilla was stale but the tempura fish was ok.  Even though we were all stuffed we had to try there cheesecakes! We ordered an original slice. It was velvety and smooth. Pretty pricey at 7 bucks a slice.

We had first tried Fox and Hound, then Champs, but finally ended up at the CF... not the traditional factory experience I'd say. My first real time to try any of the food was this past Memorial Day. I'm never really sure about the crowds on holiday weekends, but I was happy to see that there was no wait to get seated at 2 in the afternoon for a late lunch.  I was enthralled to find a specially priced lunch menu that is available until 5pm. Cheesecake Factory is famous for it's LARGE portions which are proportionately priced. The lunch menu offers some of their most popular dishes for the fraction of the price, so instead of spending $20 or more per entree, you can spend an appropriate $10-15 for a lunch sized portion. ... I know what you're thinking. Lunch sized portion!? I am not a child! I want to eat! Trust me, I thought the very same thing. However, I decided to save a little here, and if I was still hungry, hit up the food court in the mall adjacent to the restaurant. However, their smaller portions are actually the size of a normal serving, so I found myself plenty satisfied at the end of the meal. HUZZAH! I ordered the chipotle pasta while my date had ordered their shepard's pie. Both dishes were of the quality that I had expected from the Cheesecake Factory, which was very good.

I called inside to let them know we arrived and was forced to circle the parking lot several times until I saw a waiter in site with my order 15mins after I arrived. For anyone who lives in this area you know the melee in this parking lot since they are located in the mall. That being said...if you are going to advertise curbside service you need to enforce the signage telling people they will be towed if they park there and are not using it. Obviously you are not being taken seriously! When I brought it up to the server who delivered the food to the car he laughed and stuck his hand out to be paid. I did not find any humor in the experience and made that clear in his tip. Even though the food is above average the process is way to lengthy for takeout and dine in if you ask me.

Extremely packed and a lot of people waiting, but the wait wasn't terrible (around 20 minutes). I was looking to order a couple drinks, but noticed there weren't any prices next to the drinks (one of my biggest restaurant peeves). I asked the waitress and the cheapest beer would be around 7 dollars, and the cocktails were even more. I decided to scrap that idea and just go for the food. The waitress very nice but was a bit absentminded (never brought us our bread until our food came, gave the wrong change for the bill), but she had been there for 12 hours and was obviously very tired so I don't blame her at all. I like how they give you both complimentary wheat and white bread. As for the actual food, my nachos were very cold, where the cheese was past the melty consistency and was just solid chunks. There was very little topping so most the chips just ended up uneaten. I tried the fried mac and cheese which was okay. The cheesecake choices, just like the menu choices, had plenty of variety and ours (chocolate tuxedo?) was a pretty solid choice.

The service was excellent... our waiter was courteous and attentive without being overbearing.  We never had to look or wait for him.  He seemed to be doing his job pretty damned well. Didn't go for the cheesecake, but I've had it many times before.  It's good of course.  They had seasonal flavors of pumpkin and pumpkin pecan. I think that one of the highlights of this place are the appetizers.  I've gone a few times in the past and done it tapas-style, and left quite happy.  Good way to go if you want to get cheesecake, as you won't end up quite as stuffed.

Raquel G.,"Staten Island, NY",0,2,,1.0,10/21/2015,"If your child has any severe allergies to nuts, BEWARE!!!! I witnessed some of the employees at this location touching cheese cakes to give customers with their bare hands with no hand washing in between. Being a mother with a child who has a severe food allergy, I was appalled. Also,  the fact that they may be spreading their germs during the current flu season-disgusting!!! I watched one employee while on line waiting for my 'to go' order for a good 10 minutes- not once did she wash her hands or put on gloves. My conscience would not let me leave that place without notifying the manager. What a disgrace this manager, Andrea, was. This was not your typical ""my food came out cold"" complaint, this was a ""you're violating code"" complaint. No apologetic tone from her, just that she told the worker to put gloves on. I asked for the district manager's number given her unenthusiastic response. Called the DM, Raymond Day, 3 days ago and still waiting for a response. Guess there are defects all around with this company's management. Because of the laziness of some of their workers or perhaps poor management in not making sure their employees follow code, they are setting themselves up for a big liability. Warning to Cheesecake Factory: Not sure if you read the news, but kids DIE from anaphylactic reactions EVERY DAY, mainly from throat swelling from nut allergies!!!! The fact that your employees may be transferring nut proteins to other cheesecakes that people order when they think it doesn't contain nuts is a HUGE liability. Beware!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=420
Rye M.,"Franklin Park, NJ",1,9,,4.0,5/22/2010,"Cheesecake factory is a great place to eat, but you need to take your time. The menu is like reading a Bible; if you come wanting asian, there's asian; if you want BBQ, there is BBQ, etc. You will certainly find something to appease you. The prices are fair too. You'll pay upwards of $12 dollars for a plate, but the portions are very hefty. You will certainly not feel cheated on. When I went, I ordered a pulled-pork sandwich and my better half ordered a Hibachi Steak. The pork sandwich came with BBQ sauce on the side and LOADS of fries, enough to take back home. The sandwich was flavorful and moist. Very tasty. The Hibachi Steak was very tasty too. It came served with a baked potato side. Drinks are a little pricey at Cheesecake Factory, but not much more than average. I asked for a Ginger Ale and it was almost $4 for it. I was somewhat surprised. However, the food, service and friendliness of the staff is not to be surpassed. My only qualm is the long lines. On weeknights expect a wait of less than 20 minutes. However, if you plan on going on a weekend, expect to wait at least a 1/2 hour or more. Call ahead and make a reservation. You'll thank yourself if you do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=420

There was a slight mix up on where they seated us apparently the server in that section had gone home, but one of the servers stepped up to the plate and said she would take care of us I was impressed once again all of this took maybe 20-25 min all together so no big deal. I order the Boston house salad and it was out of this world and I finish the whole thing and the portions are huge after that I had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta which was recommended by our server (she was awesome) it was a great call too cause I loved it and my brother had the same thing and he said it was outstanding also.Out of the nine people in our party including three children not one complaint was heard overall I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory to family and friends",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=420

Emily T.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",3,24,,3.0,1/16/2011,"If you have never been to the well known Cheesecake Factory, then I recommend you go there for the actual cheesecake rather than the food.  The cheesecake, of course, are extremely delicious and also pricey as one would expect.  I usually just go for a slice rather than a whole cake as one cheesecake will fill me up pretty quickly and satisfyingly.  They have a nice range of cheesecake to choose from and the flavors will not disappoint. As for the food part of the restaurant, it is just average.  Sure when you walk in, you are immediately in awe of the fancy decor and wonder if you are actually in a restaurant.  The decor hinges on some Egyptian theme but it is not cheesy, no pun intended.  Anyways I have been there quite a few times.  For appetizers, I had the ultimate nachos with spicy chicken and a small plate of stuffed mushrooms.  These two are straight up yummy and I love the tang of the spicy chicken.  The stuffed mushrooms, while are tiny, packs a hefty punch and you won't feel them giving you 8 little mushrooms is a rip off of your money. For the entree, the portions are huge and one plate is more than enough for two people.  I do not recommend ordering more than one plate per two people unless you haven't eaten for days and have been left in the desert with no food or water.  If the aforementioned criteria applies to you, then by all means, please eat your heart out.  I have not tried too many plates of pasta but I have tried more than a few to know the pasta dishes are average at best.  The only common thing they all have is they are all very heavy handed and leaves you feeling bloated and stuffed after having just half of the dish.   Of course, the dessert course is self explanatory right?  I vote just aim directly for the desert! Overall, it's a decent restaurant.  The food is ok at best but it's a place you should try if you have never been to the famous Cheesecake Factory.  The cheesecakes are great and it's the only saving grace to a so and so meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=420

Hints of decently cooked Kobe beef drowning in pure butter. Chicken picatta - copious amounts of salt with very little other flavor.  In hindsight it seems as though they belive that by overdoing elements that make food decadent they'll achieve excellence - nothing could be further from the truth. On a positive note the ambiance is nice (esp. considering the number of customers)...and I've heard great things about their staple - cheesecake.  The principle function of a restaurant is, however, the food (namely appetizers and entrees)...and if you can't deliver that then you can't be rated well as one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=420

After a night after devouring ribs at Big Ed's - I decided that I had enough room for dessert so a visit to Cheesecake Factory was at hand. First things first, as soon as you see this place you think: Way too fancy for just cheesecake. As you walk in, you still think the same. This place looks and feels like it should be on the Las Vegas strip in Caesar's Palace or something. My group and myself decided to just go for dessert so we didn't get to taste anything else besides cheesecake, but I took a look through the menu. Cheesecake Factory has an extensive menu, besides cheesecake they have burgers, pasta, salads, Asian dishes, and much more.  I had the Tiramisu Cheesecake and it was just as delicious as I though it would be. I also tasted the Cookie Dough Peanut Butter Chocolate something something cheesecake and that was way-way too rich. It was good, but if you like something that rich you should order it. Factoring decor, the menu, and that huge bar of theirs, this will be a good place for a date.  I will eventually head back, to see how the rest of their menu shapes out so I can get a good feel for this chain, but based on my love of cheesecake alone, this place is a go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=460

I have been to some other Cheese Cake Factory restaurants in other cities but being local to Edison, i frequent this one.  The art and decor is great. high ceiling and comfy booths.. The food is exquisite particularly the Chicken Madiera.. yum yum.  And lets not forget the countless options of deserts. I am a food junkie so i like to try different desserts and believe me all deserts are fabulous so can't really say which of them would be on the top of the list.  The one and only drawback is the wait time . Usually have to wait for nearly an hour before getting a table. but then since it is at Menlo Park Mall one can take a stroll in the mall before getting buzzed  for a table.

Michael D.,"Fort Lee, NJ",4,34,7,4.0,8/25/2009,"Ah yes... the legendary Cheesecake Factory.  While some complain it is hit-or-miss and a tad expensive, I consider it to be the McDonald's of casual dining: they aren't reinventing the wheel, you know exactly what you're going to get, and generally with those expectations they deliver. The drinks are well made and don't skimp on the liquor, which is good considering you are paying restaurant prices.  The outdoor seating in the summer is a plus.  Though perhaps the most delightful aspect of the Cheesecake Factory is taking a date there for some drinks and dessert... preferably later in the evening.  It can get LOUD in there and most of the indoor seating is not very intimate... but if you bring a date the bar area seating is better and outdoor seating when in season works as well. If you go during the evening rush or on weekends, be prepared for up to an hour wait, which is why this is my favorite 9pm + late dinner joint.  But at least there's a Barnes and Noble right next door, and even though the hostesses claim the buzzers do not work in there, they do.

However, since the one at Menlo Park Mall opened, I can count how many times I've been there and how many times I've been disappointed by what I ate on both my hands. First off, let's talk about what a ridiculous wait.  Maybe if you got there for lunch on a weekday it wouldn't be so bad, but if you want to be there for diner?  Expect a wait, anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half... depending on the size of your party. I usually don't mind a wait, and it's not that bad if you can walk around the mall while hanging onto that vibrating light up thingy they give you, but they claim it only works inside the restaurant.  LIE!  You can take it to Barnes & Nobles if you'd like.  But aside from feeling the need to stay in the restaurant, the place is usually swarming with hungry people, all just standing around waiting for a table. Finally you get seated and you get the menu and WTF?! Why is it so dark?  I always find myself squinting and turning from page 13 to 4 to 7 to 18 back to 2, still not sure what I want by the second time the server comes around. Service could be better, I'll admit it's gotten worse since they've started opening up all over the place.  I used to hear that Cheesecake Factory servers were the best paid, cause they WERE the best.  I used to be a server, so I know how it rolls.. but when I leave a restaurant unhappy 8 out of 10 times its the food and the service.. so as of late, Cheesecake has not impressed me much.  (i.e. this happened today... a HOT plate [aka a plate that your server has let sit under a heat lamp much longer than they should've) gets brought out by a person holding it with a cloth napkin.  Instead of putting it on the table in front of you, why is this person handing it to you?  Or better yet, why are they expecting someone closer to them to hand it to you?!  Isn't it their job?!  To serve you your food?  What is the purpose of tipping them, if they're just going to burn you or your dining mate instead?) I'll give them points however for the huge glasses they give of soda (it better be huge, i'm paying $3 for it), the huge portions of food (though I know spots where I can get more for much, much cheaper) and for giving the pages in their ridiculously long menus, numbers to navigate by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?start=500
