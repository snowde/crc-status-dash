Mark H.,"San Diego, CA",77,194,70,5.0,12/17/2017,"This place is so inconsistent that I've decided I'm going to do a review (and update my review) after each visit. Yesterday we had Vanessa as our server. She was fun, on top of things, and professional. She was everything you'd want from a server at this restaurant. It's too bad the rest of her colleagues are always so hit and miss.  Still, for this visit, Cheesecake Factory gets a 5. On the next visit, when I review them again, that could rate a one star.  The food, meanwhile, was your standard Cheesecake Factory food. Solid.  How will my next review shake out, though? Stay turned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2
Jabber W.,"San Diego, CA",2,36,14,3.0,1/7/2018,"Gets crowded on a Sunday afternoon which is understandable . And the seating is not always the  best, but what else would you expect? Limited vegetarian fare but we know that too.  The bread took some time coming and all the exuberance our server tried to rub on to us did little to mask the dampening the spirit feels towards the end if the holidays and a month of festivities.  The portions are humongous and ordering the lunch-size portions makes a lot of sense. A real food factory with a well worked out algorithm to serve over a hundred items.  We might return, them again we might not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2
Chris D.,"San Diego, CA",23,43,1,3.0,1/7/2018,Arrived and was told there would be a 50 minute wait.  We got our pager and drank at the bar.  After an hour and 10 minutes passed we ask the same hostess and she said sorry we are slammed tonight.  We finally were seated after an hour and 20 minutes.   The server took our order and said she would bring bread.  She showed up five minutes later with just the hard white bread.  This is the third time visiting this location where the wheat bread is not made by the kitchen in a suffient manner.   We ordered an appetizer before the meal however it arrived 3 minutes before our dinner arrived.  The manager was nice enough to deliver it and comp it before having to ask for it to be comped. The food is always delicious and plentiful.  If you have 2-3 hours to spend then this place is perfect.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2
Adrienne D.,"San Diego, CA",62,62,45,3.0,12/23/2017,"LOVE Cheesecake Factory! Everything is awesome, never had a bad meal here. I will say, however... This place is SO DIM! Like, super dark. I walked into the empty restroom and was afraid Bloody Mary would appear in the mirror! Jk. But seriously, it was hard to see in the restaurant and restroom. Another thing that really gets on my nerves is why restaurants won't let you order off happy hour menus if you're not at the bar. Similar chain restaurants like Applebee's has made the exception for me before, but not at the ole Cheesecake Factory! I asked a busser if it was still happy hour and he said yes and brought us a menu. Our waiter, Peter J, told us that information was wrong and wouldn't make an exception after being given a menu and some hope for happy hour *eyeroll* Peter then told us, ""idk if you want to make your way over to the bar...."" and I said, ""yeah, not THAT bad."" Pretty sub par service compared to an Applebee's, Peter, and that's saying a lot. Our waiter also wasn't interested in topping off our water. Which is fine, because I'm not too shy to ask :p I ordered the spaghetti and it was delish! My friend ordered a burger and the fries came out 10 minutes later. Not sure why they didn't just serve everything at once. Surprisingly empty restaurant for dinner the Friday before Christmas. Maybe they were short staffed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2
Al A.,"San Diego, CA",1037,765,1726,4.0,10/6/2017,"Hey, it's another Cheesecake Factory that's connected to a mall! How original, huh? /smirk Like most, in this winning restaurant franchise, expect waits ranging from 20 mins to over an hour, depending on the the time of day....or day of the week. Your patience is crucial. If you want to avoid long waits, try eating at the bar area. Same service and offerings.  Parking is ample but you'll be competing with folks taking patronage with stores in the mall. What I'm trying to say is, there won't be much unless you park at least 150 yards away. Wearing comfy shoes is crucial.  The food offerings are identical to other restaurants within the chain. Don't expect ""local favorites"" or a menu that reflects the local demographic. The Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya pasta tastes and looks the same here as it does in the Hermosa Beach location in LA, where I tried it the first time....back in 1993.  What I'm trying to say is, consistency can be a good thing. As long as you do something consistently well.  At this location, you can rest assured, it's still done well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2
Tiffany Y.,"Temecula, CA",214,67,40,5.0,9/15/2017,"Always pleased when I come here. The service is always good, they're attentive and also patient with kids and big parties. The food is always placed nicely with generous portions. The only down side is that it gets extremely busy and they do not do reservations.  The menu is long with tons to choose from. My only hesitation is that because there's all sorts of entrees, I never know what to choose because I can't tell what their specialities are besides cheesecake. I always end up going with some sort of pasta. If you like fried zucchini, I'd think Cheesecake Factory definitely has the best and it comes with a creamy ranch. That's something I always order without hesitation. If you want to go to a restaurant with someone and you don't know what type of food to get, go here because their menu has something for everyone's taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2
Mandi H.,"San Diego, CA",75,78,56,1.0,11/28/2017,"Few reasons for my one star rating. First off, when we were sat we asked for water and it was never brought to us, nor once I went to the bar to get it myself was I offered a refund. The server was extremely rude to my 8 year old when he was ordering - cutting him off and making sarcastic comments about if she was his mother. The worst part was it took 30 minutes AFTER my entrée was delivered for the other adult to get food.. because she forgot. She didn't credit anything or offer cheesecake for the mishap. The food quality didn't match up to the price, and honestly this location was the worst I had been to.  There's clearly a lack of training, and attention to detail on basic things at this Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2
Darell R.,"Oceanside, CA",12,45,63,3.0,12/7/2017,"Always have to stop by the Cheesecake Factory on a Esco mall visit. Ordered the Thai chicken lettuce wraps and the ""lunch"" size meatloaf.  I like ordering the meatloaf because the portion size is always well accommodating, I usually have to take some home, for some reason the mashed potatoes and the corn portions were small and the meatloaf was really burnt around the edges. Good thing I ordered the lettuce wraps because I didn't feel like reordering and waiting for the meatloaf to be done.  The bread served prior to the meal was a little on the stale side and not warm at all so it was a bit difficult to spread the cold butter on.  Didn't have anything to drink other than water, which is kind of rare considering they always make my old fashioned just right... Not writing off this location due to the burnt meat loaf, just thought I would mention it for quality control purposes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2
Sherry G.,"San Diego, CA",25,9,2,4.0,1/3/2018,Seems to be a problem with staffing .  Place is about 1/3 full and we are waiting ? Also - FREEZING in here . Literally has to be set on 65 degrees . Still waiting on being seated . Ownership needs to take a look at what is going on with staffing and why they are spending so much money cooling this place to an ice box .  @@ Now seated and Vanessa the waitress deserves 5 stars . Food is good like always . Management needs to look at their staffing and temperature . Maybe Vanessa should run the show .@@ so we got our food and it was actually better than expected .

The mall itself seemed pretty crowded on a Saturday night around 5:30 but we found parking not too far, and it was nice out so I was totally fine with the walk - we had  a short wait, of maybe 20 minutes or so, it went pretty quick.  It's nice to see this restaurant notes the calories now, and has a nice selection of small plates like the flatbread I ordered because when you come here you MUST get cheesecake too!  So....nice changes for sure since I was last here.

Angelica C.,"San Diego, CA",21,55,212,2.0,7/15/2017,"Been here numerous times and the food is a hit or miss. Two separate occasions I tried the Chicken Bellagio and the Crusted Chicken Romano, both pastas tasted as if I was eating pure salt.  Two weeks ago I decided to come back and try out their Pasta Carbonara and the dish came out perfect. Pasta wasn't overly salty and the sauce was nice and creamy. My boyfriend and I stopped by for dinner last night and since I had a great experience ordering the Pasta Carbonara on my last visit, I decided to play it save and order it again.  However, the dish came out and I was super disappointed. The sauce had a liquid texture and was not creamy at all and majority of the bacon pieces were burnt. I've never encountered this problem at the Fashion Valley location, but going there isn't really an option since we live in Escondido.

Angie J.,"San Diego, CA",1487,64,100,5.0,12/12/2017,I just moved up to Oceanside so I am glad there's a cheesecake factory now close to my apartment. I love going to cheesecake because the food is always good and this location did a stellar job of fast and friendly service. The service was great and the food was good I would most DEF come back. For dessert we had the anniversary cake the chocolate one and it was dynamite. The location to is right off the freeway so it's super easy to get to and also it's inside the mall so you can do your shopping before after. I came here with my mom and my newborn baby and they accommodated us well only thing I couldn't find the changing station it might've been in the handicap bathroom but it was occupied for a long time so I had to change my daughter outside on the bench.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2
Maritess C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",653,1127,4678,3.0,5/19/2017,"I came here to have dinner. We decided to eat here since we were at the mall. I ordered a tropical iced tea to drink. I ordered the Thai coconut lime chicken dish with steamed rice. It also came with shiitake mushrooms and snow peas. The sauce was flavorful even though my taste buds couldn't taste anything since I'm sick with a cold but the taste was there. The waitress checked up on us a few times and refilled my drink. I enjoyed my meal. For dessert, I got an Oreo cheesecake to try. My daughter chose this dessert to share. This dessert was delicious and sweet.  My friend ordered a napoletana pasta and as he dug in it, he found a piece of plastic in his dish. Gross! I told the server and also talked to the manager. Unacceptable! People make mistakes but no excuses. This is the food industry. Manager apologized and didn't charge me for the meal and the meal my friend got which was the ribeye with mashed potatoes and green beans. My bill came out to less than I expected. I still give them 3 stars because my meal was good and overall had a good experience. I may or may not come back. The service here was excellent and I appreciate the apologies.

I got the pumpkin cheesecake slice,which was very ok. It needed more cream cheese for sure and for $8 might as well have bought the pumpkin cheesecake from Costco for $10 and it's very tasty!

However the drive from carmel valley/ Del Mar is annoying it's better than going to the overcrowded fashion valley location. We need a Cheesecake factory in north county coastal!! Our favorite dishes here are the grilled artichoke appetizers however it is current out of season :/ For our main we love the chicken piccata pasta dish which I always share with my kid. I recommend sharing this dish or you will be greatly over your average calorie intake! We don't always get cheesecake but if we do we always ask to eat half at the table and to have the other half to go!

The restaurant is a very nice fine dining feel. They box your food for you in to go boxes if you didn't finish. However I was a little disappointed today when I went to go eat my mashed potatoes I saved and the server I guess decided on his own I didn't need mashed potatoes and didn't give them to me! (Sad face!!!). Next time I'll have to box myself. Those mashed potatoes are obviously really amazing btw.

Michele M.,"San Diego, CA",138,344,2950,3.0,1/21/2017,"Cheesecake Factory... I love to come here because it's conveniently located at the mall and they have such an extensive menu.  The problem is some dishes are good and some are really bad.  I've also ordered the same items at different times and they do not always come out tasting the same. Yesterday I had the Chicken Salad sandwich in the Renee's Special.  The Chicken had some gristle in it and was on the tough side.  I only ate half of it because it was unappetizing.  Maybe the problem is quality control.  Whoever is making the chicken salad should be checking the chicken for bones, gristle, fat, etc. before they mix it up.   I've had the same issue with the Chicken in the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  And I really like those, when the chicken is good.    They do serve delicious bread and cheesecake.  My favorite is the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cheesecake.   Service is hit or miss depending on who your server is.  I will be back but hopefully they will work on their quality control.  No one likes to have to spit something out at the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=20
Cerena P.,"San Marcos, CA",340,188,1966,4.0,1/2/2017,"Very nice restaurant! It's nice to be able to take a break from shopping and enjoy some great service and delicious food. This place has a HUGE menu, everything you can ever think of from sandwiches, pasta, Mexican, steak and more. So many great options to choose from its always so hard to decide!  The avocado eggs rolls have great flavor, the only downside is I wish they were more crispy! I also didn't care for the veggie melt, but the portion was huge! (See pics) they gave me an entire sandwich and half of another. Definitely not skimping out on portions here. I really also enjoy there salads and the dinner entrees. This place is perfect for anyone, since the menu has such a huge variety. It's impossible to not find something to order. The cocktails are fabulous and the garnishes are wonderful. Not to mention the cheesecake, best cheesecake around? Without a doubt!  Service is always fantastic and always super nice and friendly. The only downside is I'd say it's a tad bit pricy.

When they finally bagged it up, the order was missing the side of topping that the hostess suggested. Great. Then, I waited another 30 minutes for the dressing, which I was told they were getting, only to have someone come out and tell me they were all out--after I already paid and waited so long. Really?!

Christine C.,"San Diego, CA",202,19,80,2.0,10/14/2017,"I came here to celebrate my 18th birthday dinner with my family. We like coming to The Cheesecake Factory for special occasions so we were very excited to come. Upon arrival, the lady who greeted us at the front desk was very kind and our wait time was shorter than expected.  However, the issues began when we got seated. To be quite honest, I was not impressed by the way the waitress treated my parents. I believe her name was Teresa. She was ""nice"" but it seemed very fake, like she was tired of her job. Since we were seated outside, my mother commented, ""I would just like to report that there are ants crawling around on the tables."" Her intention behind the comment was not for the staff to respond immediately, but to inform them to better help them in case they were not aware of this. In a sassy and annoyed tone, Teresa's response was, ""Well, we are sitting outside, so we cannot do anything about that."" and then she turned our back on us and walked back in.  Generally, I'm a pretty easy-going person and it doesn't take much for me be content with customer service, but I did not appreciate our waitress' attitude and tone. I understand that the job of a waiter/waitress is very demanding and they have to deal with annoying customers every single day, but I would appreciate a little more tolerance + grace. This really put a damper on my night.  On the bright side, the Godiva Chocolate Cake is amazing! But it would have been even sweeter had the waitress approached her job with a positive attitude. If it's really too hard to maintain a positive attitude at work, I would suggest finding another occupation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=20

When you enter employees at the front are quick to put your name and guest list down. Wait time can vary it just depends on the day and time you go but this place is popular!  On this particular visit me and my friends went to celebrate a friends birthday. (This is on a Thursday night at 6 and the wait time was only 10 minutes). We were quickly seated after putting our name down for a table and the waiter was very friendly. He took our orders and while we waited brought water and bread which we pretty much devoured because it's so good! And he also let us know in a timely fashion when our food would be ready so we weren't just left at our table wondering when we would get our food. When it all came out it looked great, although for my plate they forgot to cook angel hair pasta with the meal instead of the original pasta my order came with (I ordered the chicken Parmesan with pasta), so I asked the waiter if they accidentally mixed up my order and the waiter quickly took care of the problem and apologized and got me the correct order. Everything looked and tasted delicious! As I said our waiter was awesome! Unfortunately we forgot to get his name but if I ever get him again I'll edit this post with his name. He was a great help when we had questions, quick to get our food, helpful in getting my order right, and overall a great waiter! :)  Also, since it was our friends birthday we got the free treat that the Cheesecake Factory gives out, along with us all singing the traditional birthday song!

Their cheesecake that they are known for is way too sweet, you'll have a stomach ache within two bites. Their menu is pages and pages of items.

My friend and I were catching up so we forewarned our server that we would be eating and drinking slower than a normal dinner. We were never rushed. He continued to check in on us to make sure we had what we needed but we didn't feel like we had to hurry up and leave.  We shared the roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread. So yummy! Perfect size to start your meal for two or big enough to eat by yourself as your dinner. I ordered the Pasta da Vinci. I love this dish as it has three of my favorite things- chicken, mushrooms and caramelized onions. The portion size is large so you can take leftovers home and eat the following day.   To drink, I was disappointed that my usual cocktail was removed from the menu. :( I tried something new and ordered the Georgia peach (blended cocktail) first. It was tasty but could have used a bit more liquor. For my second round, I ordered the blood orange margarita. Maybe I am a lush, but once again, it could have used more tequila.  We finished with the chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake.  OMG!  Nutella heaven!  Really good. Cheesecake Factory has the BEST whipped cream I have ever had. I could eat a bowl of that alone.  If you are shopping nearby, this is a great spot. It does get busy the closer you get to 5-6:30 pm time frame. The ambiance is very pretty.

Instead of letting me know while I was placing the order, the person at the check-out counter waited until after I had paid to say that they had ""run-out"" of take-out boxes. A staff member apparently thought dumping my factory nachos into a cardboard pizza box would be perfectly okay. The staff gave absolutely no thought to the fact that a pizza box is cardboard because the bottom of the pizza is not wet and sticky like nachos!!!  As I walked to my car, I noticed that the bottom of the box became completely wet as all the ingredients of the nachos were seeping out of the cardboard. If you don't have the proper materials for a take-out order, why take the order in the first place??? Absolutely ruined the experience of getting premium nachos.

Our server greeted us as soon as we sat down and brought us our drinks right away and the fresh complementary bread. We ordered our food shortly after and the server let us know in a timely manner that status of our food order so that we weren't sitting and wondering where our food was. I ordered the chicken piccata and it was amazing!! The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce added the perfect flavor to my pasta dish! My friends were all pleased with their food as well. Since it was my friends birthday, our server was kind enough to give us a free desert and sing happy birthday. My only complaint is that it took forever to get our check and to pay. Other than that though, the service was great and the food was outstanding!! Can't wait for my next visit (:",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=20

I order the same thing almost every time, Evelyn's favorite pasta. Omg I love it!!! But honestly everything on the menu is delicious! But I will say Tuesday when I went my pasta dish was different. They didn't put any pesto on it and the ratio of the vegetables were off. Now to any person who just ordered it and had never had it before wouldn't know the difference but I definitely could tell. I told the waitress but she acted as though she could care less. She's like "" do you want a manager?"" Well no I don't but you could at least act like your listening lol.

Jeff T.,"San Diego, CA",8,80,285,5.0,4/10/2017,"I'm not sure why the reviews of this Cheesecake Factory (Westview North County Mall) are so harsh. Most of the 1 star reviews are for bad service or long wait times. If it's not your first time here, the possibility of a large crowd and long wait should be no surprise. You can decide whether to wait just by looking at the gathering in the lobby. I think it's only fair to get pissed if the receptionist grossly underestimates the wait time. That hasn't happened to me yet and usually the buzzer they hand out goes off sooner than they say it will. The food and atmosphere are excellent and priced right. The menu is huge and I find it hard to believe there isn't something delicious for everyone. I love mushrooms so the Chicken Madeira and Da Vinci pasta are my go to dishes. That sauce is so good. The Chipotle Chicken Pasta is delicious too for a change of pace.  The kids menu has real food and portions! I hate going to restaurants that shamelessly charge over 5 bucks to microwave a box of kraft mac n cheese. Here, the mac n cheese and Alfredo pasta are made with real cheese. The sauces are rich and plentiful. The dishes are huge enough for an adult. My experiences here have always been consistently positive. Plus, the food at this location is superior to the Fashion Valley location. Sure, there's a waiter here I do not like but that won't stop me from coming to enjoy the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=20

Bar seating is first come first serve.  We ordered drinks and 3 different pasta plates. Drinks took about 10 min and food about 15 min. All pastas were good and but noodles were a little undercooked. The chicken in the pasta was ok not very flavor-able. Also not a good grade of chicken kind of a cheap like chicken cutlet. I couldn't taste the alcohol in my drink at all. It taste like a milkshake. Service was GREAT. And overall everything was good. Cakes are to die for.

Richard was pleasant, efficient, and let my friend and I chat and gab without hounding us to order. My friend ordered spring rolls off their skinnylicious menu and I ordered something I haven't had in years- romano crusted chicken with mashed potatoes (I subbed out the pasta for this). It was good..but for some reason, it wasn't as big as I remembered.  When I ordered it, I was thinking I would take some home for lunch the next day, but that didn't happen because I easily finished the whole thing. We also ordered two drinks- white wine for her and a blood orange mojito for myself.  Good combination. I'm not a fan of their cheesecake here so we passed on dessert. The meal was okay- a solid 'okay'.  It's probably the best option in the mall area, so if I was there and hungry, I would probably end up here.  Would I purposely decide to eat here again?  Not sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=20
Jericho M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,4,1,3.0,7/8/2017,"Came here with my friend tonight that I haven't seen in forever. I've been here a number of times before but never reviewed so here is my first review We got there and I gave my name to the hostess and he told us it would be 30 mins which was fine. But it wasn't 30 mins we waited for almost 50 mins and watched as couples that came after us got seated. When i confronted a different hostess she that our names where not in the system which was irritating but wasn't as bad. What really got me was that the same male hostess looked at me numerous times and didn't say anything.  The food was not bad. I felt it was better back then but that's subjective. I ordered the mac and cheese burger and we had sweet corn pancake thing for an appetizer which was good but not great. Our waitress was ok she seemed a bit irritated but it was hectic and it's not like she lashed out, very timid and didn't smile. The service was ok.  The saving grace of this review is the Cheesecake. I got the tiramisu cheesecake and it was good. Not to crazy sweet and not bland at all.  This place wasn't bad and I'm willing to give it another shot but based off tonight this was probably not as great experience I've had at a Cheesecake Factory.  I say give it a shot you might have a better experience that I had. If all else fails at least the Cheesecake is good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=40
Vincent P.,"National City, CA",397,228,2257,2.0,2/20/2017,"The only redeeming factor about Cheesecake Factory is their cheesecake. Everything else, not so great.  After coming here on a Saturday and being told the wait was over an hour, we decided to come back the following Sunday. Turns out, that didn't help either as the wait was still over an hour. If you have a party of over 2, don't bother coming on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday night.  They don't take any reservations so your only option is to physically come here and wait it out. Worst yet, when you stroll around or go to the bathroom during your wait, you see multiple empty tables around. Do they have a pact with the stores in the mall so people are more inclined to shop while they wait? Do they just like to make people wait to inflate their ego? Who knows.  After 75 long minutes, we were finally seated. Got the complimentary bread and it was good. Then we ordered. We got our small plate of chicken taquitos which were decent.  Then we waited for our entrees. We waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. It probably took them a solid 45 minutes to get the food out. The manager did come out to apologize and say everything would come out shortly. But when you've waited 2 hours in total and only have bread and 2 bites of a taquito, the apology becomes a moot point.  .... so a day and a half later, we finally get our entrees (exaggerating). I got my Smokehouse BBQ burger. ""Burnthouse"" would've been a more ideal name for it. One of the bacon strips was burnt so I threw it out. The beef patty was cooked a medium well even though I asked for medium. It was way drier and less juicy than I wanted. The fries were way too greasy. I tried really hard but couldn't finish my meal. When I went back home, I felt like crap.  The other dishes on our table were a chicken pasta and an angus beef sandwich. These 2 items were not even mediocre. The chicken pasta was dry and minimal in flavor and the angus beef was servee with too many pieces of pure fat. Yikes.... all of the entrees missed. Worst yet, at $15-$20 an entree, you're essentially throwing your money into a fireplace ordering these. Our waiter was nice though.  I would not recommend this place and would not come back other than for cheesecake or alcohol on an offday/offhour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=40

Apparently, they didn't have more than 4 2 inch pieces of asparagus, and a tablespoon of undercooked farro.

The cheesecake is by far the greatest cheesecake that I've ever tasted. I love the fact that the cheesecake factory lives out to its name by actually being a factory of cheesecake. Every time I go I get the same dish and the same appetizers it's pretty much already set in stone what I want because every time I go it's like if I'm tasting it for the first time. The drinks however vary depending on my mood and can drink a nice wine or a mixed drink. The food is fresh and delicious with the smoky taste to it and the ambience is very nice because the lighting isn't too strong. It's a great restaurant if you're going out on a date or taking your special his or her person for a nice night out.  I wouldn't recommend taking children because it may be a little too mature for them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=40

If I'm spending $80 or more on a couple of entree, and a couple or three glasses of wine, and it is 8.30 in the evening, I don't see why I have to endure noisy kids on the table behind me.  Not only do you have to put up with their continuous screechy chattering, but the parents with their constant questioning - do you want to use the bathroom, do you want to get down, do you want to get up, would you like another drink - drove us insane.  It as like being in their kitchen at dinner time, instead of an adult restaurant. Why can't they keep kids out of the bar area? The Red Robin, in the same mall, has now done so.  The food is not as good in the Red Robin but at least we will be able to have a meal in a more adult environment as it is now over 21's only!

Go walk around the mall to kill time while you wait.  I will say if you come after 7pm on a weekday, you should have a good chance of not having to wait at all.  This location has become my new favorite because it's the closes to me. Haha.  In my recent visit, Heather was our server. She was very friendly and attentive. I finally tried the Lemon Meringue cheesecake. It was pretty good. The lemon part was tangy, the cake part was creamy and the meringue was just like a airy marshmallow. I never really liked meringue, but this one was good.

I never really realized that The Cheesecake Factory was here at the mall so when I found out I had to get some cheesecake obviously. This spot is pretty busy or at least when I come here which is usually during the week after 6pm. The restaurant is a nice size with a bar and the lights are low. I know what I like when it comes to cheesecake so I like, macadamia nut, carrot cake, raspberry or any just about anything fruity. The cheesecake menu is very large and it may take you about 10 minutes to decide on what you want. The service I had was really good like it usually is when I come here.  The first time eating cheesecake here I sat in the dining room and the service was wonderful with no complaints. I don't come here for the food but maybe I will have to start because the pics look good. Anyway so I ordered a hot chocolate which was pretty good in a nice size glass. The crazy carrot cake was fantastic because it had whip cream and icing. The next time I come here I will definitely get something to eat and see how it is.

Rayna J.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",166,198,32,3.0,2/13/2017,"Came here on a little date night with my love! It was pretty good. We ordered the Chicken Parm, however received the Parmesan Chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. Wasn't what we expected but we were hungry so no complaints. We didn't even let the waiter know. HA.  It was actually delicious, almost more delicious than the Chicken Parm would have been.  I did have an amazing little cocktail while I was there. The Blood Orange Martini, alright let's not lie...it was 2 martinis cause they were that good.  Overall it was a good experience. Nothing to rave about but, good service, good cocktails. Wrong meal, completely understandable with all their options with similar names.  I'd come back :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=80

CJ H.,"Murrieta, CA",39,23,,2.0,11/3/2017,"We have dined at the Cheesecake Factory many times, but will probably not do so in the future, at least at the Escondido location.  We were notified of a ten minute wait, no worries - we enjoyed a drink at the bar.  When our ""buzzer"" final alerted us our table was ready, we waited for too long for someone to direct us to our table.  Once seated, my wife had to remind the waitress three times to bring her the requested drink.  We ordered appetizers and our main course.  After too long of a wait the main course arrived, no appetizers?!?  The manager apologized and said it would be removed from the tab (that's all, an ""oops, we won't charge you?!"" My wife requested blue cheese crumbles for her sandwich, the server acknowledged, ""crumbles, correct?""  When it came, it was blue cheese dressing.  Being too long of a wait, we ordered two cheesecake slices to go, red velvet and Godiva - we realized we got red velvet and dulce de luche - I like both so I ignored the mistake.  If that is not enough, we get the bill, and guess what?  We were being charged for the absent-appetizer.  After more time, and bringing this to the attention of the server, it was corrected.  Overall, a very disappointing meal....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=80

Our server was great and the food came out really quick. Their menu is huge but they make everything on it so well. I ordered the Cajun pasta with shrimp and chicken. It was mouth watering good! The spices and flavor were bold but not overpowering. It came out piping hot, I wanted to eat the entire plate but my eyes are bigger than my stomach. BF ordered a  chicken Parmesan sandwich with a side of marinara sauce for dipping came with a side salad. We upgraded to a Cesar salad for a little extra. Sandwich was also really good.

Hppn H.,"San Diego, CA",11,48,306,3.0,9/5/2016,"Well was in the mood for some dessert but as you know it, once you get here the smell of some dishes are very tantalizing.  Opted to take a booth outside as the evening was winding down and it was actually very nice.  So back to the initial plan, it was to grab some dessert and just hang out with the family.  After looking over the drink menu and with a few questions, opted for the Pineapple Mule.  Was told it was just the right amount of sweetness.  After the drinks came out, the appetite started to waiver a bit and we perused the menu again just in case something caught our eye, and as we have been to other Cheesecake Factory's, we saw the Avocado Eggrolls with the tamarind dipping sauce, and that has always been a staple for us.  Figured since we are here and the little one is behaving for the moment, lets just have dinner and hes wanting pasta, so lets kill two birds with one stone.   So dessert turned into dinner and here we go.  As noted, we have been to Cheesecake a few times in the past, so there are dishes that we like and others we have yet to try.  But being that we did not want to always order the usual, we opted for dishes we haven't had in a long while but thought it may be good to try again. So for appetizers, we opted for the Avocado Eggrolls and Hot Cheese and Spinach dip.  Lets say the eggrolls never disappoint, but the Spinach dip needed more to desire.  It came out hot with fresh chips, a side of sour cream and chopped tomatoes, but the kicker was the spinach and cheese seemed more like a side dish at a steak house rather than a cheesy dip.  That was lackluster at best and to boot, it was very bland.   Entrees we opted for the Crusted Chicken Romano, and the Carbonara with Chicken.  Now these fared much better in overall taste.  The Crusted Chicken Romano could have used a bit more sauce, but overall it was a decent dish.  The two cutlets and mound of spaghetti was not bad, but could have used a bit more salt. For the Carbonara with Chicken that was really good.  The sauce was thick and the noodles were coated well with the sauce so it was not dry.  It was not as rich in taste, but that is a personal preference, but the chicken was tender and the overall taste was good.  Would recommend this dish. Alternative:  We did not have the Shrimp Scampi tonight or the Spicy Chicken with Cashews (which you can also request with Shrimp) those are by far good solid dishes.  The Spicy Cashew Chicken with Shrimp is an original from way back, but they only show it with Chicken, however you can add the shrimp and definitely something youll want to go back for. As for the real reason why we came here initially was for dessert, after having the dinner feast we went down the list for something fresh and would clean the palate, and since we have tried the many cheesecakes before, there was one that we had yet to try and it was surely worth the trip down, and that was the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake.  Its tartness from the Key Lime and sweetness of the mango really cuts through the cheesecake giving you those layers of flavors that just hit the sides of your mouth and make it water.  If your looking for something to just have a fresh palate, that is a recommendation, but note it has sweetness to it, but enough where it just taste good.   If your in the mall shopping and want something decent, I would suggest hitting up this establishment and of course they have a full bar which is always nice if you've been shopping all day and need to unwind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=80

We ordered our drinks and they were brought to us almost immediately. The bartender was nice but as we watched him make drinks we could see him becoming increasingly irritated and angry when his syrups ran out. He threw and empty bottle on the ground, finished the drinks he was making and left the bar area. He seemed to be much calmer when he returned but it was not something that we enjoyed watching. We finished our drinks and went to the front to order cheesecake to go. We stood by the register for a bit before someone finally noticed us and took our order. We left with our cheesecake only to discover once we got home that they had given us the wrong thing.

Eric L.,"San Diego, CA",463,466,145,5.0,12/9/2016,"There are a few people in life that truly excel at their job.  The waitress at Cheesecake factory last we went is one of those people.  After greeting us with a standard smile and hello, we were asked if we would like bread.  She foresaw that we would want the brown bread so as we were going to request only the ""honey oa-"" she smiled and nodded knowing exactly what we wanted.  When she came back, she gave us a basket full of the coveted honey oat bread with another one broken up with banana slices!   Why is this important?  She explained to us, ""This is for this cutie"" gesturing at our 1.5 yr old daughter.  She had the foresight that she was young enough to not eat a meal and just brought us bananas.  Why? Because what child doesn't like bananas?  I'm not sure if this was kosher with the manager but she didn't seem to care.   The rest of the service was kind of standard with great service on refills, checking in on us every once in a while, and always smiling and waiving at our kidd-o.  Then the bill came.  She asked if we wanted any to go containers for any of our food... and drinks... What the whaaaaat?!?!  I hope I don't get anyone in trouble for this, but the simple gesture of getting us a $0.05 cup to have one refill of a drink that cost them $0.005 to make and cost me $2.50 has completely solidified this cheese cake factory as my ""I'm going to always eat here when I'm at this mall"" place.  So to the manager, if you're reading this and worried that this small cost of a cup and a banana is costing you, I assure you, in the long run, it is not.   Sadly, I don't remember the waitress's name but I do remember how she treated us and will now have a gold standard to hold all food service people to.   Oh yeah, the food was great too.

Sean C.,"San Diego, CA",41,409,256,3.0,4/13/2017,"My first time I'd ever been to the Cheesecake Factory and let me tell ya, it lives up to the Cheesecake name. Unfortunately there were a few other aspects that were lacking. Firstly, when we had sat down, after I was told that while we were waiting our table just needed to be cleaned, I put my arm down on a sticky spot. Not the best but okay, I'll deal with it. I then tried to sit comfortably in the wicker chair and it was actually pretty bad. I was not able to sit up and had to recline way back in order to hit the back of the chair (I'm getting over a neck and back injury so this was particularly not fun throughout the meal). The 2 waiting staff members that helped us were very nice. Once we had our waitress, going through the menu and asking for help was easy, she was very helpful and knowledgeable. I ordered water to drink and the Cajun chicken poppers as my meal. The water was clearly tap and didn't taste great but our waitress did keep the glasses full excellently. My chicken was pretty good and there was a lot, but was not noticeably Cajun as the name implied (it was bland normal tenders). I was very happy the waitress was kind enough to add a side of gravy for the mashed potatoes but was disappointed when it wasn't white country gravy. The succotash was also good and spiced very well. By far the mediocre meal was made all the better when I had gotten the Nutella hazelnut cheesecake. It was delicious. The crisp flaky crust and rich Nutella with chocolate and topped with whipped cream was very good.

Sean D.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,1,1.0,9/22/2016,"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant let alone a Cheesecake Factory. I have been to many Cheesecake Factory's in different areas, this was my first time at this location. I put my name down for a party of 7, even with empty two seaters around she said it would take 30 minutes, which was fine. After waiting the 30 minutes and seeing endless 2-4 top tables get seated that came in way after us, I went up to ask how much longer. The rude hostess said another 20 minutes after wanting to know why it would be that long she said it was because they were waiting for a table large enough to seat us. Being a waiter all throughout college, I knew this could be true. I asked why they couldn't just put some of the available smaller tables together, just section off what was available since we were waiting so long, which she said she couldn't do. After waiting another 20 minutes, I asked again and she rudely said another 20 minutes, which at that point was ridiculous. After waiting so long I went to the bathroom and noticed about 4/5 tables completely empty in the same area, when I brought this up to her she rudely said it was for a table of 11 people who requested it for 7pm. I was confused since at the Cheesecake factory you can't make reservations, she was incompetently and impolitely telling me that it wasn't a reservation. But in my mind a large group of people who put their name down for a specific time hours later is the exact definition of a reservation. The manager walked over and after asking him about this, she interjected and began practically yelling at me ""explaining"" how that wasn't a reservation and she would seat me when she would seat me. He didn't say anything he seemed completely clueless and unable to handle the situation. We decided to leave at that point, after waiting for over 70 minutes and go somewhere else close by. After another 30 minutes I got a text my ""table was ready"", guess by 40 minutes she met 100. All in all the hostess was extremely rude, the manager was incompetent and no one seemed to care.

Arlyn E.,"Oceanside, CA",24,158,3,4.0,2/17/2016,"Ok so normally I don't often go to Cheesecake Factory let alone go to restaurants due to finances. This time it was because of my loving fiancee wanting to treat me often. How can I refuse such an offer?!  It was very crowded and ended up waiting. We got worried as to if they forgotten us because others who came after us were already seated. Whether they had reservations or other reasons is uncertain. Upon being seated, I noticed the seats were a bit dirty still and so was the table. I ended up taking a napkin and a bit of water to at least clean the table.  Food is always great. No complaints there. My one main complaint was my drink. More than half of my drink was filled with ice. One doesn't pay for a drink just to have ice. I ended up taking out majority of the ice onto a saucer. My fiancee was baffled as to how much ice there really was. I didn't bother asking for another one just because of how busy it was.  We forgot how big the portions are and ended up taking much of the food home with us, which worked out well for my fiancee so he could have something to take to work for his lunch. If only we didn't order an appetizer and perhaps share the main dish then we could've tried out a dessert.  Overall it was a good experience. Nothing too severe that would make us not come here again. Perhaps we'll just dine for lunch during times when it's not too crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=160

Maria M.,"San Diego, CA",14,71,36,3.0,8/15/2016,"Nothing special. Not worth the price. Hit and miss.  Went there for cheesecake but by the time we got done shopping and got seated it was time for dinner so we decided to have dinner before the cheesecake.  Service was fantastic. No complaints there. Had to wait for over 20 mins to get seated but oh well, I can live with that. Everything looked so amazing that we decided it was worth the wait.  Once we were seated, the waitress got our order, and brought us our drinks and some bread with butter to keep us happy till our food made it to the table. We ordered two medium cooked cheeseburgers - one old fashioned for my husband, and one mac and cheese for our 10 year old, and a farmhouse omelette for me. 20 mins later we had our food. One of the burgers came medium-rare, almost rare, and the other one came well done. Tasty but a bit disappointing that we didn't get the burgers cooked the way we wanted them. Tasty enough that we didn't send them back. However, we had to ask for a few extra tomato slices since both burgers only came with a small slice of tomato inside. Fries were excellent.  My farmhouse omelette dish was very disappointing! I chose a side of potatoes with it. The potatoes were bitter, had too much paprika and were burnt. Definitely not edible. Well, maybe good enough for someone starving who hasn't touch food in a week but definitely not good enough for someone paying good money for them. Someone needs to teach the chef how to cook (or fire him/her)!The omelette was tasteless. I would give it a 3 on a 10 scale. It was bad. I barely touched the dish. It was not good at all. I helped my kid finish her burger and stole some of the fries that came with it. They were fantastic! One of the best fries I've ever had!  We ordered the white chocolate raspberry truffle for our little one for dessert. It was very disappointing. I expected more for $7.45 per slice. Basic cheesecake with raspberry syrup that tasted very chemically, topped with two blobs of reddi-whip! Really, I expected more!  Based on our one time experience I don't think we'll be back there for dinner. Definitely not worth the price. But we might be back to try some of the other cheesecakes. They do look good.

After a day at the Safari park, we came here also minutes after 4 PM for their happy hour and an early dinner.  Our waitress seemed really nice at first, but often kept just walking away as we were trying to make an order. We finally ordered the same chicken tender appetizer as last time, only to be told 10 minutes later that they were out of stock on the tenders...  We almost decided to leave, but decided to order some fried macaroni cheese balls instead and a really good Chicken entree (which I can't remember the name of, but I uploaded a photo of) with asparagus and mashed potatoes.

Since Moving to San Diego in 2009 I must admit I had not been back to either the OC or SD locations and was pleasantly surprised to stop in today. It brought back wonderful memories of family dinners, happy hours with coworkers, and my 21st birthday at the Newport Beach location as the decor is exactly the same across all restaurants. We decided to sit in the bar area as we just wanted a small bite and a few drinks after several hours of shopping and the happy hour deals can't be beat. Fried Chicken Sliders were a pleasant and tasty surprise with deliciously tender but, crispy, well seasoned meat. Everything is served on the side which works well for my produce-hating husband. Yup, just give him the meat please. The tomatoes, pickles and lettuce were perfectly fresh and the latter two added the most perfect extra crunch for me. We also ordered nachos and here's where it got amusing. Everything on the side. Literally everything. If it ain't meat and cheese the hubs wants no part. So, the waiter graciously obliged to place the order with chips and cheese only and brought out little dishes with the sour cream, Pico de gallo and, guacamole on the side. I swear my husband missed out as the guac and Pico were outstanding and the perfect accompaniment to the cheesy chips. He actually apologized profusely for his fussiness to which the server, a wonderful young man named Andy, smiled and reassured my hubs it was not a problem at all. On that note: Andy was very attentive, patient, friendly and accommodating to us: the kind of server you always hope to get.

Once for an entree that was not longer available, and another time for a pie that we were hoping to celebrate with.

To our surprise, Brian (the manager) came over and made us feel like whiners and simply said, ""We run out of things on occasion and there's nothing I can do.""

Management let us return it and gave us a gift card (not a full refund on credit card and not a full amount on gift card either).   But that's how I found out about their HH b/c we had to wait around for quite some time for manager to issue gift card.  Their HH is no where to be found online or on their website. So hoping this review will help fellow yelpers out there.  Here are the list of their 16 (yes, 16!!) HH items: Roadside Sliders Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip Avocado Eggrolls Fried Macaroni and Cheese Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes Southern Fried Chicken Sliders Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls Guacamole Made-To-Order Tex Mex Eggrolls Fire-Roasted Fresh Artichoke Factory Nachos Buffalo Blasts Chicken  Pot Stickers Crispy Crab Wontons Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread Do you know how long it took to type that out.   We had: - Mojito $5: really good. A nice portion and I loved how they used plenty of fresh mint for this drink - glass of cabernet $5: decent pour but not the best cab we've ever had for HH - Southern Fried Chicken Sliders: Crispy Fried Chicken Breast on Mini-Buns Served with Lettuce, Tomato and Pickles Four sliders come out and each sweet roll has a fried piece of chicken. The sweet rolls are buttered and grilled (yummy!). I thought the fried chicken was dry but friend thought this was a really good slider. - Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip: A Delicious Blend of Crab, Artichokes and Cheese Served Warm with Grilled Bread It's not a large portion but it's sufficient enough as the cheese is pretty rich. It did taste like real crab was used as well. I wasn't a fan of the toasted bread crumbs on top. - Avocado Eggrolls Avocado, Sun-Dried Tomato, Red Onion and Cilantro Fried in a Crisp Wrapper. Served with a Tamarind-Cashew Dipping Sauce. This is my favorite appetizer here at The Cheesecake Factory. the deep fried avo eggrolls here are divine. The avocado is creamy and plentiful. The eggroll wrapper is fried perfectly and provides a nice crunch to this dish. The selling point really is the tamarind dipping sauce. It has such a unique sweetness to it that I just love so much. - Guacamole : Made To Order Not bad. You can request the guac to be made mild/med/spicy. Was it the best happy hour we've been to? I wasn't too impressed with the food but I wasn't all that hungry that early evening. But when was the last time you had the chance to choose from 16 items on a Happy Hour menu. When was the last time you saw ANYTHING on TCF's appetizer menu for $5. It felt like finding a nickle on the ground (versus a penny). You know that feeling... Take advantage of this HH if you're around this area. I heard a rumor that the Fashion Valley location might start a happy hour as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=220
Courtney O.,"San Diego, CA",616,649,571,5.0,8/16/2015,"The only thing you have to remind yourself when coming to the Cheesecake Factory is that calories don't count. Lying to yourself is allowed.  I stopped into this Cheesecake Factory just to pick up some take out to go. Unlike most locations I've been to, they had good control of the waiting crowd so the waiting area wasn't too congested. I was able to easily get to the counter to order my banana cream cheesecake. I'm usually a red velvet or Oreo cheesecake regular but I was told that the banana cream is a must have so I gave it a try. SO GLAD I DID! It was absolutely delicious! Surprised the BF with a slice after a huge exam he had and we were both in cheesecake heaven. Yum yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=220
Jennifer S.,"Escondido, CA",416,875,619,3.0,5/27/2014,"I've been looking forward to visiting the new Cheesecake factory in Escondido since before it opened as I really like the food there even though you get big portions and it's a little pricey.  FINALLY, we headed over for an early lunch on Memorial Day. Overall, we had a good experience.  We had no wait., so that was awesome, but after a few minutes we realized we were FREEZING.  We asked to move outside to defrost, but she said they only had one table available out there and it was in full sun and not very comfortable.  As our food arrived right then, we decided to stick out the cold a little longer. As for the food, the husband had chicken wings, which he loved.  They were pretty big and even a la carte, were enough for a meal for him.  I ordered off of the ""skinny menu"" which I was happy to find had normal sized portions!  I had the lemon shrimp that came with asparagus and a small amount of capellini.  It was delicious AND I had room for cheesecake.   Well, as for the cheesecake, I take full responsibility for not asking questions.  I ordered the carrot cake swirled cheesecake because it listed on it that it had almonds... most carrot cake does have walnuts which I am mildly allergic to. And I should have asked instead of assuming the almonds were all the nuts that would be there, but walnuts were swirled throughout so i was picking them out... not as yummy.   Our server was very friendly, but a little on the forgetful side and possibly new.  She mixed our order with someone else's and the bill had to be re-arranged and she didn't get the add on scoop of ice cream with the cheesecake or the ranch instead of bleu cheese.  She made up for it with being very nice, though. I thought it was a little loud in there, but the husband disagreed.  The ladies room was neat and clean as was the rest of the restaurant. We'll definitely go back for more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=220

She forgot my lemon and our drinks took a minute) and my son loves the Oreo cheesecake.  I have to recommend he Fried Macaroni (delicious!!) which means it's probably terrible for you!!!  Also the strawberry shortcake is surprisingly WONDERFUL!!!!  It is with fresh strawberry and freshly biscuits and vanilla ice cream and whipped cream w/ these wonderful surprises called small sugar crystals sprinkled throughout - great another 10 miles to run but certainly worth it!! Also like the coffee and steamed milk!!  However for the 100 plus bucks for so-so food you get two stars!  Go for desert only!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=220

We were sitting outside in the sun. Asked her if she could ask the bus boy to move some umbrellas around for us because we saw that he was doing that for other tables. We had to ask her 3 times. We saw no one come out. The 4th time we asked her, she told the hostess that we wanted to move umbrellas. The hostess said ""Unfortunately, it gets really bad out here. We cannot move these umbrellas"". So my boyfriend said ""So you are unable to make adjustments?"" She just looked dumbfounded and said ""Let me ask the bus boy for you"". Again, we had to ask 3 times and still NO ONE adjusted the umbrellas.  2. We had to wait 15 minutes to get water and she forgot his coffee. She eventually brought the coffee but did not bring the sugar till 10 minutes after the coffee.  3. When she came to ask if we were ready to order, we said yes. I also asked for some bread and Desiree snapped and said ""I usually ask after I take your order"". RUDE. The table behind us had a super sweet waiter. She asked them ""Can I get you guys started with any drinks?"" And after they ordered their drinks she said ""Would you like some fresh bread while you look over your menus"". I wish we asked for a waiter switch.  I am not sure why we always get stuck with the worst waiters.

Mario L.,"San Diego, CA",65,143,119,4.0,5/10/2015,"Dear Cheesecake Factory, The wait sucks, the lobby gets packed, every seat at the bar will be taken, and don't go too far because you have to check-in within the time allotted; This was a tough pill to swallow.  45 minute wait, told it would be a 20 minute wait. Once seated everything fell into place nicely.  I appreciate the Karl Strauss and Thunderweizen on tap.  The menu has a lot of items, largest variety of cheesecakes I have ever beheld.  I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta w/Shrimp and Chicken and a mango key lime pie cheesecake.  The Jambalaya pasta turned my attitude completely around.   The dish has a lot of seasoning so it is spicy but I enjoyed it.  I'm not sure how the cooks made the chicken but it was the most tender piece of chicken I've ever had.  The shrimp was good but the chicken was extremely good.  The vegetable pasta was a pleasant surprise, the sauce was buttery, and the portion was enough.   The waiter was really courteous and took the time to talk about the menu with us.

Gary R.,"San Diego, CA",810,680,1770,5.0,1/30/2014,"I've avoided The Cheesecake Factory like the plague because I've been terrified at looking at their menu. What's inspired the terror? The rumors that their menu items sport some of the highest caloric counts in the country. Well, I had a light lunch there with my parents this past Sunday and my anxiety was tempered when I encountered a menu that was devoid of caloric information -- I didn't have to stare at an actual calorie number that would discourage me from ordering what I wanted. Thank goodness! My sister and I decided to take full advantage of their bar; I decided on a glass of the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc. It was lovely, showcasing light notes of citrus. There's nothing I enjoy more on a late Sunday morning breakfast/brunch than a glass of wine.   The family shared an order of the nachos to whet the appetites. I tried to be good, only having a few controlled bites. The nachos were actually done quite well. The chips tasted as if they were made from scratch, and the sauce, cheese, and other toppings melded together quite well. Superior taste. I tried to play it relatively good and avoided what I thought would be too heavy. I opted for the Chicken Salad Sandwich and asked for a green salad in lieu of the french fries that come with it. The sandwich was stellar. It was very well-balanced, the chicken not being bathed in too much mayonnaise. The bread was perfectly toasted and had a lovely flavor.  My mom had a spicy chicken sandwich. I commandeered it for a second and took a bite; it had a lovely kick to it! Everyone else at the table seemed to be genuinely pleased with their choices, too! I avoided dessert, but mom and dad walked out with cheesecake for later.  Yeah, this is a chain, but it's darn good. I may now have to visit The Cheesecake Factory that recently opened up in my neighborhood!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=220

The past few visits, I've left less than impressed but we gave it another go and it was great! We sat in the bar area at a high top table. It was bright and airy with all of the windows. Our server Jeanie was top notch! Her cheery, helpful attitude was refreshing! We ordered a couple Dos Equis and browsed the menu. The menu is just massive! I was very impressed with their appetizer options! There were so many to choose from! I chose the appetizer Greek Salad. Hubby chose the appetizer sliders. My salad was super fresh with good sized cuts of tomatoes and cucumbers with feta and the vinaigrette was so I good! Hubby's sliders were AWESOME! There were 4 of them (really good sized!). He added American cheese and asked for extra pickles. Wow! It was tough eating my salad while he thoroughly enjoyed those yummy sliders! It was a lot of food for appetizers! Jeanie was excellent from start to finish. I have zero complaints and we will be returning....very soon!

Our meal was delicious, affordable, quickly served, peaceful (yes, even during Thursday night football). We ordered the Pear Flatbread which is low calorie and also a great price of $6.95. We also ordered the Fish Tacos Tempura style. There were four street tacos with black beans and rice at a price of $13.95. Our server, Roberto, was pleasant, polite, very respectful and extremely professional. He gave us plenty of time to look at the menu and even asked if we would like bread and butter instead of automatically bringing it. Because there have been times where we go and just want soup and salad. I appreciated that. When it was time to order, he kneeled down so he can be at our level and also read back our order to ensure it was correct. I like that he took that extra effort. It saves time and any grief if the order came back wrong. He refilled my drink without me having to wave him down. When I asked for salsa, he kindly stated what options they had and brought my choice immediately. He also asked if we'd like the dessert menu. We were actually very full so we didn't get dessert, (I know, you think we're nuts for not ordering dessert at Cheesecake Factory!)

Fiona M.,"San Diego, CA",103,171,117,2.0,3/9/2014,"Ok, who designed this place and WHAT WERE THEY THINKING????  Dining out is something I do when I want to relax and spend quality time with my daughter. When I want to comfortably sit across a table and have a real conversation with my tween. When I don't want to have to stress about preparing the meal, serving the meal, and cleaning the meal. Summary...EATING OUT SHOULD BE RELAXING!  I am giving two stars for the decent food and the location staff who really tried to keep us happy with the ridiculous conditions they have to work with.  For example...Maximum capacity of the place is 300 people. 300 PEOPLE in one restaurant and here is what you have got... 1.) A  TINY WOMEN'S RESTROOM with only 3 stalls. Ummm...are you kidding me? The restroom is smaller than a standard storage unit! Plus, have they completely failed to consider the SUV sized strollers Mom's are driving these days? IDK how even ONE stroller is going to fit in this bathroom...was there even a changing table? Reflecting back, I don't recall seeing a changing table.  2.) ONE REGISTER. There is ONE REGISTER for the staff to work with. ONE REGISTER for 300 guests?  3.) VERY VERY VERY LIMITED seating for waiting guests. (I suppose they expect you to stroll the mall and wait for your, ""table ready"" text message.) Alas, have they not considered how bad the cellular reception is in the mall?  4.) THE PATIO. This was the icing on the cake. We waited 25 min to be seated in the blaring hot sun on the patio.All of the umbrellas and awnings were covering everything but the seating. (Of course the umbrellas were unable to be adjusted or moved.) We had to ask for extra napkins and a JUG of water because the table was too hot to touch and we needed constant hydration. After 10min my daughter had a sunburn, we were unable to rest our arms on the table and we had consumed the entire JUG of water.   MANAGEMENT! ARE YOU LISTENING? IT IS MARCH and TOO HOT FOR YOUR PATIO! Your restaurant is in ESCONDIDO! Come July, August and September, your patio is going to be useless unless you consider some better shade coverage and even cooling misters.  So, the staff really tried, the food was decent. I appreciated the SKINNY menu. BUT FOR GAWD SAKE...the entire set up is a MISERABLE. The stress of just BEING in that chaos defeats the purpose.

Told me waitress it didnt taste good and she said that next time I could switch to Mashed Potatoes for no charge.  Did not finish food.   In general, service was not good.  No water refill.  No checking if the food was good.  No offer to replace food I didnt like.

Artichoke dip was more spinich than anything else. Also it came with salsa and sour cream which is a weird pairing. Our main course hubby got meatloaf and I got salmon and steak with mashed potatoes. There was like 2 pounds of potatoes, a sliver of salmon and three cubes of steak. Hubby's was huge but was so bland he literally dumped salt and pepper on it for flavor. We were at a tiny 2 person table and had a neighbor talking to us the whole meal. They were nice but it wasn't an intimate or private dinner. The service was ok but it took forever to get any food.

We were told that there was a bit of a wait, but that we'd be seated around 6:20 which was acceptable. We went into the mall knowing we'd get a text notifying us a table was ready and we meandered a bit and then hung around Cheesecake Factory waiting for our table. 6:20 came and passed, as did 6:30, and 6:45. Around 7:00 my friend's wife went to the hostess stand to see if there was any estimate as to a wait time and she turned to ask her associate who was a young man looking at the computer/terminal. Upon asking him, he loudly and rudely shot back a remark towards her clearly very frustrated.  I don't recall exactly what he said, but it was loud, unprofessional and very uncalled for of him to talk to the hostess like that.

The Cheesecake Factory is really nice. The ambiance is great. The staff is very welcoming and looks out for the customer. I really appreciated how kind everyone was from the hostess to the waitress. The food was once again food from the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge but the quality of food is subpar. While I was there I ordered the rib-eye steak. It was a good quality steak. Not as good a steak that you might get from a steakhouse but a solid steak. If you're at the mall, this is a great place to stop for food with family and friends. The staff is very great. The food is ok. The main reason to come here is the atmosphere and the ambiance of the location. I did have one problem which was the wait time to get a table.

Can barely taste the alcohol but you can smell the vodka.  Lemon Garlic Shrimp ($17) - Portion was small, but it was on their skinni-licious menu. It was just enough for me although more pasta would have been nice! Cajon Chicken Littles ($15) - I had a piece of the bf fried chicken. You can definitely share this amongst several people. Huge portion and you also get a side of potatoes. Fried goodness and carbs is what you get here! Smores Galore Cheesecake ($8) - I enjoyed the smores cheesecake. Had a graham cracker crust, chocolate cheesecake and marshmallow topping. Sweet, but delicious!  Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake ($7.50) - If you like tart, then this is your dessert. I enjoyed this cheesecake as well. Both the lemon and raspberry gave the cheesecake lots of fruity flavors.  Our party of 9 waited about an hour and a half for a table.

I had the Cuban sandwich and it was decent, the bread was toasted a little too much but I still liked it. My girlfriends garlic noodles with shrimp was perfect. My little sister had the kids pasta with butter and parmesan and she enjoyed it. Finished the meal with the red velvet cheesecake, and it was good as always. This is a new location, and you can tell they're still working out a few kinks, but overall we were pleased. They took a while to bring out one of our pastas, but they came out and apologized and offered us a soup or salad.

Dee W.,"Aurora, CO",0,8,,1.0,9/9/2017,"Well we finally found the sorriest excuse for a waitress in all of San Diego County. Her name isTheresa W.  And she works at the cheese cake factory at the Westfield Mall in Escondido. Why she works there is beyond me. She CLEARLY doesn't like her job. She hates her job. She doesn't want to be there but yet there she is. Unhappy, angry at the world and taking all that frustration and depression out on her customers.  She came to our table a total of 3 times our entire meal. I counted the times the people seated next to us had their waitress come to their table...... 11 times !!!  We got a refill of our drinks AT THE END OF OUR MEAL.  She asked if we wanted bread... Sure!!! 22 minutes later.... ""here's your bread"" and DROPS IT on our table and walks away. Ummmmmm where's the butter? Yummy dry bread.  Oh boy!! That's what I want. CHECK PLEASE!!!!  So we are done and we can't wait to get out of there..... tic tic tic 15 minutes later she shows up with the check. 15 minutes to print a check??? MAYBE she was having a bad day. MAYBE she had the flu. MAYBE her BOSS should do some training. MAYBE it's a management issue.  No one wants to be around a grump. People pay good money to have an enjoyable time. And get this..... the check has a suggested gratuity boldly right in the middle. It starts at 15%. We spent 75 minutes there. 30 minutes just waiting for her. A full HALF HOUR. Did we approach the manager about the issue? No... Why you ask ? Because we eat here monthly folks. Every month we watch other patrons complain to this shift manager and he does nothing except ARGUE back with the customers. We have always had normal to great servers but Theresa....... Sorry.... bottom of the barrel in service, attitude, politeness, professionalism and interpersonal communications.

Kristine L.,"San Diego, CA",5,2,,1.0,6/16/2017,"What a COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT. We spent 2 hours waiting. and waiting. and waiting. On our anniversary. I ordered a beer as soon as I arrived (my husband got there first) and literally 15 MINUTES later the server informed me that they were out of my selection. So I immediately ordered food (if this was the pace of the evening I knew to try to get everything in asap). ANOTHER 20 minutes went by and I finally received my 2nd choice beer. NO JOKE - 35 minutes into service. It was another 10 minutes before the manager came by to tell us one of the items we ordered was not available. My husband still didn't have his second beer at this point by the way -- about 3 minutes later his tacos arrived, and our appetizer (fried cauliflower) but no sign of the avocado toast. When the two dishes arrived I ordered my second beer *WHICH NEVER CAME* and was not surprised at this point that the food was cold. The ""hot spicy cauliflower"" was cold. The fish tacos rice/beans also cold. It was another 8 minutes before the avocado toast arrived. WHAT THE FUCK. I didn't even want it at that point but I was so hungry and thirsty I dove in. It was about another 5 minutes when the substitute salmon dish came out. My husband was done with his cold tacos. Our glasses were empty. I promptly asked a busser to get a box (for the cold cauliflower) and shortly after the server told me the keg had blown (which was TOTAL BULLSHIT because I saw two servers with multiple stellas walk away from the service well MOMENTS before she was table side.) 1 hour in and I still hadn't received my second beer. We were so unhappy with our experience we didn't even want to stay for dessert (truly the ONLY reason we chose this restaurant) and what's even more sad, I had to ask the manager to come over to explain our unfortunate situation and his reply was; ""well I took the salmon off I didn't realize how long you waited so hopefully that helps. happy anniversary."" REALLY? While some people dine to hunt for free-bees that's not our style. We were clearly there to relax and enjoy a few drinks. Not to mention it was our anniversary!!! A GENUINE apology would've been GREATLY appreciated. A simple gesture to come back another time for dessert to give them another chance would've possibly changed our perspective. But UNFORTUNATELY, no one was able to suffice the situation. We felt completely disregarded. Guests..? Hardly. And on such a special occasion. I highly suggest looking at other options as there are SEVERAL in the area (outside the mall as well) with far better service and appreciation for clientele. Having been in F&B for 14+ years I've had top notch service at even the chain-iest of places and this was all around unacceptable on so many levels. I specifically told the MOD If I was on the floor I would NEVER EVER allow guests to walk out on the circumstances we did.

The patio was blocked with umbrellas, booths, and although moved by staff it certainly was awkward for those around (especially my mother). Then the booth seating had to be moved because they aren't structured in a way to allow a wheelchair to pull up.

The service was fantastic they catered to all our wishes and the food came quickly after we ordered.  The prices are fair for the food that they serve and for a chain restaurant for the most part the food is pretty good.  My wife had a salad and a garlic and ricotta flatbread.  The salad was just so-so no-frills and no thrills.  1 1/2 Stars. The flatbread pizza was lacking in flavor and had no garlic flavor whatsoever.  Still not to bad.  2 1/2 Stars.

There was Applewood smoked bacon and what seems to be a special slab of pork belly.  Outstanding. I asked for medium rare and it came out a perfect medium rare.  This burger doesn't come Standard with tomato, pickles, onions and lettuce but I asked to include them on my burger and they included my request at no know extra charge.  The flavor of this burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time.

That's how long it took for our table to be ready, too, no exaggeration and it was maddening to watch several smaller parties go ahead of us that came after us. Obviously, it is their intention to discourage large groups. After we were seated, our server took awhile to get our drinks and did not come back to give us any refills. Unless you put in your order when you order your drinks expect dinner to be awhile. And if you have youngsters, we had one, do not eat here unless you want your dinnertime to be super stressful with constant whining.  Putting it bluntly, we had very slow service to make a long story short. They must be short staffed on weekend evenings (maybe bad planning or just mismanagement). Their only saving grace was that the food was a good standard. The portions on the egg rolls are cut smaller than they used to be and the salad dressing on the salads have changed, but the rest of the food was acceptable, just not worth the 2 hour wait to eat.

I'm very glad they opened up this closer, alternative location in North County Fair Mall. Depending on the time, however, it can get just as busy as Fashion Valley. I most recently dined here yesterday on a Friday for Happy Hour at 4pm (there was no wait!). We were a little early (waiters can't put in Happy Hour orders until 4pm because it doesn't pop up on their register until then), so we decided to order a slice of cheesecake first. Our kind waitress also suggested ordering off the small plates and appetizers options from the regular menu because some items are equivalent to Happy Hour prices anyways. I decided upon the Beets with Goat Cheese small salad (beets, apples, baby arugula, pecans and vinaigrette). Delicious and fresh-tasting, I'd definitely order this again and would suggest it to anyone who's looking for a light and savory dish. Also opted for trying the avocado eggrolls, mehhhhhh. For 620 calories (also listed as 960 calories on the internet), it wasn't worth the calorie intake. I love avocado, but not warm or stuffed in a fried eggroll wrapper. Service here is always pleasant and quick. Our waitress brought our check out promptly when we asked and returned our credit card right away. Something I appreciated that ended our visit on a good note.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=240

Cindy W.,"Carlsbad, CA",2235,1958,4356,4.0,12/18/2013,"Husband and I were shopping for Christmas presents for our lovely kids after work on Friday. After about two hours of shopping, we got hungry and wanted to have a sit down place to eat and not at the food court. It was either this place or BJ's so we came here. It's been awhile since we've been to the Cheesecake Factory (usually go to the one in Fashion Valley) and we're usually not very happy with the service or the food but decided to give this place a try (again).  We put our names in and they said it was a half hour wait, so they offered to text us when our table was ready. We went off wandering in the stores and got a text just like they said and were seated immediately. VERY COOL!  It was Friday and we were in the mood to drink so I got the pomegranate margarita (blended) and my husband got the margarita on the rocks. They were huge! They were served in large glasses but that was why it was $14 for one drink.  To start, we ordered the crab cakes for appetizers and that was really good. Better than I expected.  They were out of my usual chicken and biscuits so I ended up getting the fried chicken salad served on kale, yay! I love kale! My husband got the cuban sandwich with the sweet potato fries. There were a lot of food on our plates, not to mention between the bread and the crab cakes for appetizers, we were getting pretty full. So we opted to pack the rest of our food to go and ordered cheesecake to go as well. I got the mango key lime cheesecake and my husband got the caramel turtle cheesecake. We decided to enjoy it later that night while watching a movie at home.  Service was great and the food was great. It goes to show you that not all chains are the exact same experience. I was upset that they were out of the chicken and biscuits when it was only 6pm, but I have to give this place credit, much better experience than the one in Fashion Valley.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=240
Joyce D.,"Valley Center, CA",85,170,246,5.0,2/8/2015,"I recently went here for lunch and I was really impressed by the service. Linda was our server for the day. She was really attentive and made sure everything was ok. She set out a serving spoon, looked at it and saw it was dirty, so she brought out a new one. I know of so many places where we have to tell the server something is dirty.  At at the end of the meal, she brought us hot towels.  As for the food, it was really good. For appetizers, I shared thai lettuce wraps and fire roasted artichoke with 3 other people. The lettuce wraps were delicious. It gives you enough to make 5 or 6 wraps with chicken. There are 3 different sauces to make the wraps. The artichokes were ok. Too much effort to eat just a small amount. I probably wouldn't get it again.  I shared the fettucini Alfredo with chicken with my husband. The lunch portion was enough for us to share.  Restaurants can either make fettucini Alfredo really good or really bad. It is really good here!  It is so creamy and flavorful.  For dessert, we shared the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake. I'm not a big cheesecake person but it was pretty good. Lots of nuts.  I'll definitely come back and hope that the service will be like this recent trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=240

It didn't look very crowded and we were given our table w/in 19 minutes, so it was ok. As SOON as we sat down I noticed that our table was a little dirty. Then our waitress came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. Didn't give us any recommendations so we just had water.... This is where everything took a turn down. Our waitress kept coming back every 2 minutes asking us what we wanted, like she was rushing us! I understand you want your table so you can make money on your tips, but geez.... We ordered our appetizer and not but 5 minuets later our entree's came out.I absolutely hate that! Needless to say I had to pack up the appetizer to go (which taste gross heated up later) We got our entrees, which were luke warm and not very appetizing. He has Jamaican Pepper Shrimp and I have the Chicken Madeira, NOT CHEAP! She came back ONCE to ask us if it was ok, but I had to keep getting someone to fill up my water!!! Next was our desert. Again, she didn't recommend anything. I ordered the Warm Apple Crisp and as sooon as I said that she walked away and said let me get that started b/c it takes a while. We weren't done ordering. So she came back w/ my apple crisp that looked like nothing but whipped cream and 2 pieces of cheesecake to go. THE PIECES WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SIZES. My guy asked if his was a kids size b/c it was so small, and she went into explaining to us... The cakes are pre-made, pre-cut and delivered to the restaurant...wow! I thought they were fresh..NOPE! So how old are they really? Just not impressed, I felt rushed, the food wasn't HOT, I kept having to ask for water and the portion amount of the pieces of pie were so tiny!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=240
Carmen V.,"San Jose, CA",1510,2392,10401,3.0,11/26/2013,"From an inauguration day you would expect at least some free samples and an abundance of smiles...In lieu of that, what I got was a long line, a 45 minute wait, some attitude like 'don't bother too much as there are too many others'. When I asked about the samples the lady at the entrance said that she did not know if they were giving or no. Hum, already a bad first impression. I have been waiting and monitoring the inauguration day and escaped from work during lunch break to take a look and eat something. I could not wait that long and was disappointed with the lack of generosity toward new customers (I love their food at least from other locations).  Other than not being impressed by the customer service, I was really happy to see this new addendum to the North County mall, prime location, all new, pretty, shiny. Cakes look awesome and the restaurant look big yet not massive. I will comment another day about the food.

Beth C.,"Villa Park, CA",9,1,,2.0,5/20/2017,"We drive down from Orange County once a month to visit my mom and take her out to dinner and run errands. We decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory last time. Well - Sunday late afternoon/early evening was busy as expected. We waited 20-30 minutes as expected. We were seated and after a few minutes our waitress came over. She spoke to us in a condescending manner - ""Honey"". Next we were ready to order and I asked for the Artichoke Hearts - she bruskly told me that artichokes are out of season. (I had 3 in my refrigerator that day) My mother ordered the Salmon and she looked at her with a question mark. We had to look up the one we wanted with no assistance from her. Mom asked for the fish to be cooked lightly but not raw. The waitress said she could order it rare but then it would be raw in the Center. Then I asked if my mom could get a side order of Gluten Free Pasta. She said there was no way for her to request that from the kitchen. ""If it's not in the computer I can't order it.""  I've waited tables before - this woman was a moron and lazy.  To top it all off, our salads arrived and right behind (literally) were our entrees. By the time we ate the salad the entrees were cold.

Jen E.,"Orange, CA",111,376,100,3.0,3/29/2015,"It's only fair that I admit that I've lost my love for Cheesecake Factory as a chain over the last few years.  As they added more locations, the food quality has seemed to slip a little. That being said, my kids still love it and this is a nice location.  Probably the best food you'll find at North County Fair (or Westfield North County, whatever).  It's also a good spot on nice days because they have patio seating. On most visits, we've had good service.  Never great, but good -- and always a little slower than I'd like. But I get it. They are also fiercely crowded.  The last visit, however, our waitperson, Taylor would go MIA for half-hours at a time.  What should have been a simple lunch took TWO hours -- the last 40 minutes being an attempt to get our check and then pay and have it returned. No one seemed too alarmed by this.  The couple at the next table waited 20 minutes to have their order taken by another server.      But like I said, out of the choices in and around the mall, this is your best bet.

However it is extremely loud on the weekends so the music is very muffled. Food: For an appetizer, I got the fire cracker salmon. It was truly delicious & I give my compliments to the chef.  The cheesecake is always amazing as well I love the lemon meringue! Not to be a downer or anything! But the veggie burger was horrendous. Bland with no taste & mostly bread. The sweet potatoes fries kind of made up for it... Sort of....  Service: I came in only wearing a shirt & they sat me outside which is pure craziness. I mean it's common sense! It's freezing!!! The staff was very unhelpful & quite rude. In general they were resistant to help, all the way from the hostess to the front desk.  However the manager did fix the situation. Cheers to him.  Sidenote: my soap pump in the bathroom didn't work, & the floor is dangerously slippery.

When ever I come with my family we get the avocado egg rolls and if you like avocados you must try them, they are truly the best I have ever had.   The service here is why I feel this is a three star location. It is always busy and it seems most waitress/waiters have too many tables at once. I find it difficult to get my waiters attention if I need anything.

Lately, I've been ordered the Skinnylicious Veggie Burger and it is super good. I devour it and lick my plate haha. JK about the licking part.  The waiters at this location have always been friendly. My only complaint is that the bread seems to always come out late at this location. I've been here a few times and they have always said that they just ran out and they are cooking a new batch. So, maybe it was just bad timing, but come people... the bread is so important.. there should be constantly new batches! haha. I know working in the restaurant industry isn't easy, so I understand.  The outdoor seating at this location is nice. The seats and comfortable with nice cushions. The view looks out over the parking lot.

However, the decor in the restaurant is so nice! One Saturday night, we came here at 10pm to avoid the crowds. (You still need to wait even if you come at 8pm, so that's why we wait till close to 10 to come. They close at midnight anyway.) We were happy to have the choice of outdoor seating and of course we did that! I kid you not, I feel like I'm dining at a 5-star hotel. Their outdoor furniture was classy and comfortable - some cushioned wicker booths. The dining table was probably made of plastic.. hard plastic... but it's carved! The torch heaters are such nice addition to the ambiance. They are hot in both temperature and appearance. On top of that, they make the back wall of the bar inside all glass, so we can see bottles of liquor with colorful lights from the outdoor seating area. What a nice hangout / date place! Well about the food. We got the yummy avocado egg rolls, pasta da vinci and the salmon and steak plate. We love all the dishes, and were particularly surprised at how well they made the salmon and the steak. The salmon was perfectly flavored and crusted, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. The juicy and tender steak, with a delectable wine reduction sauce of some sort, definitely satisfied our palates.  Service was awesome too! The lady who served us was friendly, polite and sensible, in a way that she doesn't over-check on us. We concluded our meal with the Godiva cheesecake, big enough to share between the two of us. It's rich, creamy, decadent and chocolaty. Best of all, it's the only flourless cake on the menu! It's good, but I don't think I'll order it again. I'd rather try something else next time.

I specifically said I prefer inside bc of the baby. 45 minutes later I received my text. I walked up to (no surprise) they ""actually don't have my table ready yet. Sorry."" What? Then I proceeded to watch all of the people who came in after Us get seated at their tables. When the host noticed me standing and waiting he asked if I wanted to sit outside. NO! I'm with my baby and it's cold out! Come on. So he apologized to tell me they gave up my inside table to someone else and they will find another for me. I should have just left. He found us a table and our service was quick but they should have done something nice for us after we waited an hour to be seated. I probably won't come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=280
Eddie M.,"San Diego, CA",23,23,6,5.0,8/9/2014,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time today. I've never really planned on going because I never thought it was a restaurant people go for dinner. I always thought it was a desert place. I was completely wrong. The Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant where every single menu item is prepared so perfectly, you can't go wrong with ordering something you've never tried.            Every single dinner plate that was ordered on our table was superb. The Diane steak I ordered was cooked perfectly, and the Cajun chicken had spices that were chosen in order to satisfy your taste buds. But that's just the meal! Eating their cheesecake was an experience out of this world! The chocolate cheesecake just melts in your mouth with rich chocolate flavor! You must order cheesecake, forget about the other deserts!            The service we received was the best I have had at a restaurant in a long time. Our waiter was very nice and polite, he spoke very educatedly, he answered all our questions about the food and checked in on us frequently.

Gabbie G.,"Murrieta, CA",39,14,19,1.0,12/17/2016,"This is my favorite restaurant. I don't live near one, so I have to travel almost an hour in both directions to eat here. This was my first & LAST time at this location. Our server Maria was horrible. After being seated for about 8 minutes before being acknowledged, she finally came over & took our order drinks. Usually, this is around the time I'm asked if I would like to order an appetizer, but no. She did bring us out bread & water, but set it down and left, without a word. I thought maybe it was because they were busy, but NOPE. She took other people's orders. 15 minutes pass & we still don't have our drinks, she walks by numerous times, & doesn't stop until I stare her in the face as she passes us again. She comes over, takes our order for food & appetizer at the same time. Still don't have our drinks. She finally brings them & then the appetizer comes out. OK, cool. When I get my mac & Cheese burger there's no condiments with it. She walks past us numerous times for 5 minutes without so much as a glance in our direction. She helps all3 tables around us but never comes over. I decide to start my timer on my phone to see how long before she checks on us. Another 10 minutes passes & she finally stops. By this time I'm ready to leave, I'd had enough. I took 3 bites of my dry burger. I asked for a box & she asked if the food was okay. I just said its fine as to not cause a scene. She brought our check & 2 minutes later, because I timed it, came to take our payment. Seriously?!? All I wanted was some acknowledgment & some damn ranch dressing & mayo for my burger. I paid & left without my beloved cheesecake. Ruined my entire day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=280

Teresa W.,"San Francisco, CA",22,81,304,3.0,8/3/2014,"I went up to hang out with my friend for the night and we were so hungry and decided to stop by the cheesecake factory.  We came around 9 ish and the wait was about 15 minutes! I normally just come for dessert but we decided to go for dinner today. We decided on the passion fruit mojito and and smoothie.  The waitress, Nicole, was very friendly and welcoming.  Both drinks were pretty good by the way.  We ordered the Cajun jumbalaya pasta and the Shepard's pie.  Keep in mind that the portions are huge!  My friend said the Shepard's pie was tasty but she thought it should have a little bit more of a crunch to it.  It was a bit too soft for her.  I never had Shepard's pie before so I'm not entirely too sure.  For my pasta however, the first time it came out with the noodles really overcooked and it was almost like a pile of mush.  I brought this to the attention of Nicole and she took care of it right away to replace it.  Honestly, she was spectacular and always came back with an update on how long it may take and if I needed anything. While the food was just okay for me, I wish there was another way I can rate the service.  It was awesome and I am so glad we had Nicole as our server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=320

Luckily, my fiancé spotted out two bar seats and we were able to sit right away. David and Chris provided exceptional service. We literally felt like royalty.  I had the steak dianne, well done, and it was still very tender and the flavor was perfect. The mashed potatoes were to die for as well.  I also had the Greek salad, which isn't much of a salad (more of a mixed vegetable & dressing mix) but nevertheless still amazing. My fiancé had the chicken Alfredo & loved it start to finish. Our food took MAYBE 15 minutes. I don't even know how they made it so fast but I was starving so it was nice to not have to wait. The bar ended up getting flooded with tickets at one point and they executed it flawlessly, hats off to you two. Dessert was a given, millions of calories and every bit delicious. They do have healthier options but who wants that.

Dee M.,"Vista, CA",669,814,2965,3.0,2/21/2014,"Hooray for CKF finally making its way to North County! Now, I can shop Til I drop at my second home - Nordys, and then veg out over a decent meal closer to home. I love Fashion Valley and The Shops at Mission Viejo, but there's something sweet about being close to that place we call home. My first encounter here was for take-out. The service was not very good. When I arrived at the checkout counter, there were three servers who appeared to be very young. They were arguing over what table ordered a ""smoothie"". One of the young ladies was extremely upset and combative because she was concerned that when she cashed out at the end if the night, that her receipts, etc would not reconcile. This, all while I'm standing there waiting to be helped; mind you, all three of them made eye contact with me several times, yet, none bothered to acknowledge me. Finally, someone asked me if I wanted to place an order. I explained that I was there to pick up an order. Apparently this did not register because I was asked the same question several times - twice by the same young lady who was clearly upset over the receipts and smoothie in question. Oddly, she was the same one I saw carrying my order to the checkout counter 10 minutes prior. Eventually, a young man appeared from his conversation on the opposite end of the counter to apologize and assist me. It was all quite dreadful. I sure hope this location steps it's service up and fast. On a positive note, I noted that my order was ready in 15 minutes as promised over the phone. My order came complete with utensils, bread and butter; just as if I were dining in - nice. I ordered the turkey club with avocado. What's a club without avocado? Boy was it good. Unfortunately, the French fries were cold.  Oh well, I still love the CKF; it will always hold a special place in my heart. That said, at some point I'm sure I'll give this location another try. They are still fairly new, bit that's no excuse for the poor service. Come on Cheesecake Factory Escondido, get it together!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=320

It was a simple order for a drink that's all...and this is what happened, the night before we went we had an amazing dinner our waiter was fantastic, anything we needed he was bending over backwards to take care of us, we decided to go one more time before leaving the area back home. As the waitress sandy approached us I asked her if I may have a frozen mango drink with some alcohol, in an intense she started giving us attitude and trying to explain what I was asking for impossible that they have certain rules there at the cheese cake factory, if I want any additional alcohol in my drinks they charge extra for every shot and on top of that I have to poor the shot in myself and mix my drink....are you serious?????if I wanted a little bit of liquor in my drink I have to poor it into myself??? On top of that I explained to her that the night before there was no questions asked about the same drink. She then goes and leaves and says I'll find out, after that she came back talking to me like I was a child, with very rude attitude, she explained they could do it for me but will have to charge me extra I said no problem.....she charges me 7.50 for the drink and an additional 12.50 for 2 shots of vodka I got 2 drinks and paid 36.00 plus tax about 40 bucks for 2 drinks that had a total of 4 shots 2 in ea drink! After all that I mentioned that since they have great drinks they have no mango drinks, and waitress sandy replies to me OH WELL CALL DAVID .....IN OTHER WORDS CALL THE OWNERS SON TO TELL HIM TO CHANGE THE MENU....R U SERIOUS SANDY????? THATS HOW YOU MAKE YOUR CUSTOMERS FEEL? AND AGIN I STRESS IT OUT I LOVE CHEEZ CAK FACTORY I REALLY DO...IN THE END MY WIFE COMPLAINED TO THE MANAGER AND THE MANAGER WAS BEGGING US TO TAKE A CHEEZCAKE ON THE HOUSE, WE SAID THANK YOU BUT WE SIMPLY DO NOT WANT ANYTHING TAKEN CARE OF FOR US WE JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THE KIND OF EMPLYEES YOU HAVE. THE MANAGER TOOK THE AVACODO EGGROLLS OF OUR TAB....( I REAALY DONT KNOW WHY) THE EGGROLLS WERE AWSOME AND WE HAD NO COMPLAINTS...I WOULD MUCH RATHER HER TAKE CARE OF THE 40 BUCKS I HAD TO DROP ON TWO DRINKS THAT TASTED VIRGIN...ANYWAYS MY CONCLUSION IS ENJOY THERE FOOD ITS AWSOME BUT WATCH OUT FOR A WAITRESS NAMED SANDY!!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=320
Janet B.,"San Marcos, CA",365,361,358,2.0,6/24/2014,"Cheesecake. Oh how I love thee... That being said, this is not one of my favorite locations. Actually, having been here twice and having one of my really good friends work here does not even make it any better which is sad and even more dissappointing because I'd much rather spend my $20 gas in going and driving that much farther to my fave- irvine or 2nd fave- fashion valley. I had been dying to come here and after the first time, noticed a. How small it was and b. How slow and not so awesome the customer service is. After tonight (my 2nd time) it's actually reaffirmed my convictions and makes me coming a third time that much harder!  We came here, me and my mom, starving and ready to throw down money and eat like queens but upon arriving- we're told that we could sit outside (which at 9pm was way too cold) or wait 10min and be seated inside. Of course- I waited to be seated in, with both me and my mom having forgotten our jackets. The hostess tells me she'll take my number down and text me when our table is ready and I kindly soak it in (secretly ecstatic cuz I love technology like the nerd I am) but also let her know we would wait just off to the right (on the benches were no one else is waiting).... There didn't seem to be much of a line and I saw many open tables, only for me to get my text that my table was set, go up to her who had forgotten my name and then her walk away completely unannounced and me bewildered waiting as to what the hell was going on (excuse me, lol). She then came back, ignored us. We saw someone else get seated and then I asked (granted I was in front of her this WHOLE time) and she said ""just a sec"". Well that ""just a sec"" turned into 3 minutes where she seats us in this tiny cramped corner that had been OPEN THE WHOLE FRIGGIN TIME WE WERE WAITING. --- as I sit down, I see the floor is wet and in disgust, embarrassingly ask her if there is possibly anywhere else to sit (as I look around and see many open tables). As my mom gets up, she mentions her side is wet too and I see a look of PAIN on her face. My poor mom had slipped on water that had been underneath the table! And the whole time the waitress does not apologize, say a word, just that they ""wax the floors"" (oh great safety concern). I saw my mom had a hard time walking (she's elderly and is not one to complain & I asked to speak to a manager at some point.... Who didn't come over until about 10minutes into my meal. Granted, he actually came over and ""thanked"" us for notifying him but when telling him I'd like to report the incident, in no way takes it into consideration, choosing to ignore my words as if nothing was said. Yes, he offered us comped cheesecake for her pain. But don't birthday people who are celebrating also get it automatically whether or not it's even actually their birthday???.... I was not impressed. He never came back. Our waitress was great, my food was great ( ordered my usual Tuscan chicken since I'm dieting and doing no carbs) and although my moms steak Diane with shrimp looked good - her shrimp had been a bit burned (and by burned I mean I could see it blackened from far away & I'm near sighted). I could tell she was too shy and emabarassed to say something. There really should've been better service and more attention to detail and I quite think the cheesecake was just not enough for the whole trouble of the night. At least my wine should've been comped or something for me trying to make an attempt to enjoy myself over dinner after the horrible service we had experienced. We really go to cheesecake on a weekly basis but I think next time i would rather wait til we can make the trip to irvine or San Diego. I'm quite dissappointed in the esco location, despite how new it is.  The service is inexperienced from what I have seen(I'm sorry but it's true) and the amount of time It takes to be seated is slow (when it seems like it's not really that busy). There needs to be either a bigger staff to accommodate everyone or further training for this location to be up to par with the other two!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=320

Although we sat down immediately we were not leaving till an hour and a half later and there were only three of us.   And why did it take so long? Well the manager Tony claimed that it was taking a while to make my burger. When it finally came out (and how long does it take to make a burger anyway?) it was missing the toppings. So another five minutes went by while everyone else ate and then they brought out the wrong toppings.  Another five minutes went by and finally the right toppings came out. When I asked if anything could be done about it the answer was ""no""  other than a free slice of cheesecake which I didn't want.  Tony refused to take anything off the bill for this inconvenience and terribly long wait.   He claimed he had already talked to us... Yeah that was when he came out to tell us he was sorry the burger was taking so long. And that was before the rest of the screw ups.  What is that actually doing for me?

I typically stay away from chain restaurants but we were given a few gift cards by my husbands employer and decided to go check it out. The biggest factor in our experience was the bartender! He was super cool! In a time where you are lucky to get a smile from a server he was friendly, on top of everything, and chit chatted with us...even though he was the only bartender and pretty busy. He really stayed on the ball and was fun to talk to. We came on Saturday in the afternoon (lunch shift) so he gets recognition for his good work. We just shared an appetizer. It was good. They have a huge menu with tons of options. The cocktail we ordered was amazing! But we ordered a double and it came out to be a $20 cocktail. Wont be doing that again, but with a good beer selection (Green Flash West Coast my fave) we have plenty of options.  The only bummer is that this place is in the mall...I hate the mall. I get it though, but it would be lovely if they put one in Vista/San Marcos. I'd definitely go more often!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=340
Dianna C.,"Oakland, CA",317,419,749,4.0,12/8/2013,"I came here for the test run service the weekend before their grand opening.  I ABSOLUTELY love this location. The only other CCF I've been to in San Diego is the one in Fashion Vally Mall. I'm so glad that there is one in North County SD! (: I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in their dining service (test run for their staff prior to opening). JBH and I sat at the bar for our dinner. Our server, I believe his name was David. He had told me that it's his first time as a bartender and that he used to work at the CCF in FV! He was very friendly and very good at explaining the menu.  To start, we got the nachos with spicy chicken... beware.. this thing is HUGE. No, correction it was GIGANTIC. We ate a lot of it, but still had some left. We though we saved enough room for our dinner entrees, but obviously we were wrong. Haha. We literally ate 2 bites of our entree and had the rest boxed up. We got the California cheesesteak sandwich and the wasabi ahi over brown rice. Both dishes were really good! The meat in the cheesesteak was thin and tender. Very delicious. The wasabi ahi was also good, nothing bad about it. Although it tasted a lot better when we were at the restaurant vs. taking it home and reheating it. I don't recommend getting the fish to-go. especially since it is cooked medium rare.  Lastly, dessert!!! We got the red velvet cheesecake. YUM. It's probably one of my favorite cheesecakes at the CCF. They were featuring the s'mores cheesecake and I rally wanted to try that one, but we barely had room for the one we ordered.

However at this location the hostess was a little rude and having a large party of 10 and their policy of not allowing call ahead seating is absurd. Once I told her we had a party of 10 I was given a rude look and was told she would have to check with the manager. After a little wait I was then told it would be an hour wait.

First thing we were told was that they ran out of white rice, and we came in right when they opened, and we saw the managers conferencing about this oversight.  The TVs in the bar area were on paid programming for a good half hour before they were changed to a game that was going on. I know I'm not there to watch tv, but when I look over and am watching KitchenAid and T25 ads, I don't feel as comfortable as I am when a game's on.  They also had a promotion going on in the lobby area of purchasing a gift card and getting a voucher. My wife and I tried to explain this to our server multiple times but she wasn't sure what we were talking about.  So everything is still getting worked out.

It's way too much for me so I normally go home with half of the meal for leftovers but it's worth it. And she always gets this steak meal. Comes with shrimp, mashed potatoes and steak and 95% of the time she says it's super good. We absolutely LOVE the bread. The bread itself is like one full meal for me. One thing I hate... the ranch.

Service was OK, he was busy and didn't have time to come by much & drinks took a very long time but we weren't left wanting for anything so overall it was fine.  Food was a disappointment.  The quality to price point isn't even close to justifiable. Ahi capacio for appetizer. It looks like a pink gel you can see the plate through with 2 slices of avo, and a pile of wasabi. It's hard to eat since the texture is like a goop and you have to tear it apart and try and get it on a fork. Hard to explain, just don't do it. Entree: Steak Diane. The only flavor to the steak pieces was a ton of salt and pepper. I asked for A1 sauce in order to eat some of it. The only bonus to the price is the serving size is huge. The mashed potatoes are good (but those are hard to mess up), and the mushroom sauce is great and has a good amount of mushroom pieces. We had a gift card so that helped soften the blow a little bit. Each got one drink (glass of wine & a beer), appetizer, 1 entree each, and a slice of cheesecake each to go. Total bill was over $100.

I believe it is the way that a place handles themselves when there are problems that define them.  Martin Spellman, Manager, handled them like a champion. He came over and took time to apologize, explain things to us how it went wrong, and let us know how he will rectify the situation. I was very impressed and will continue to patronize this establishment.  By the way, when the waiter was alerted we were waiting the service was awesome!

Robert B.,"Austin, TX",0,7,,1.0,5/9/2015,"This place is overrated.  The only reason my family and I tolerated waiting for an hour and a half to be seated is because we received a $100 gift card for this place.  We were excited that our name was finally called but to our dismay, the server was escorting us outside.  I told the server that I requested to be seated inside; It was about 55 degrees outside.  He then turned, escorted us back around to the waiting area, and told me that the ticket read no preference, so he handed me a pager and told me it would be another 10-15 minute wait.  He was dismissive and moved on to the next person.  I was pissed and hungry; but of course, I didn't want to ruin everyone's night, so I kept quiet.  Eventually, my name was called again and we were seated.   As soon as we sat down, a waiter came by and took our drink order.  As soon as he turned his back to us, a waitress swooped in and said that she was our waitress and asked if we were ready to order.  After a chuckle of disbelief, we told her we had just sat down and we needed a few minutes to review the menu.   Amateur hour continued as my eldest son had to return his glass of water because it tasted soapy.  I was trying to ensure everyone enjoyed themselves, so I was very nonchalant about it as I explained to him that it wasn't a big deal because it was just water.  We asked for a replacement.  We all ordered and had our dishes brought to us.  My wife ordered the salmon, but had to return it to the kitchen because it was undercooked.  A gentleman came to speak to my wife and took her plate, and assured her it would be six minutes.  The waitress asked if she could get my wife anything in the meantime.  It wasn't until we were all done eating that her salmon was served.  My wife ate a few bites, but was feeling guilty for holding up dessert.  It was at this point that we decided to take the rest to go, including desserts and end the unpleasantness.  Our waitress apologized and informed us that they were slammed in the kitchen because it was Saturday night.  She also said that people from all of her three tables had some sort of issue with their food.   I was disappointed that despite ordering drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts, not a single item was comped.  My wife did not eat dinner with us because of the kitchen's mistake, but we were penalized for it.  The night was anti-climatic thanks to Cheesecake Factory.  My recommendation is to drive across the parking lot to eat at Macaroni and Grill or BJs.  Oh, despite the long wait, they don't take reservations.  And trust me, the food is not worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=400

No apology for the waiting, for the lack of service.  They forgot one of the orders for our party, my grandmother, she at that point had waited 2.5 hours to get food (5:45-8:15).  They didn't ask about special celebrations, thankfully we brought our own cake! Didn't sing to my cousin.  It was my cousin's birthday and we only stayed because she picked the restaurant and had never been before.  What a horrible experience for your first time and what a way to ruin a birthday!  You should accept limited reservations for certain times/party count for parties over 7 people.  Only comped the missing meal, no overall discount for shitty service and extraordinary wait time.  This restaurant in particular is SMALL, not many tables, not Cheesecake quality.  If you are a big party, stay away!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=400

It wasn't a major deal for us since we were really there for a little celebration dinner and had just assumed that happy hour would be a perk given the time were having dinner. We all know what happens when you ASSume though. When were first arrived and asked for a table for 7, the hostess asked if we wanted to squeeze into a booth meant for 6. Not sure how to react, we all agreed that we preferred booth's anyway so we would give it a try. Thank goodness for the waitress in our section for saving us from ourselves and pointing our we'd probably be more comfortable with more elbow room once the food came out. If only we had been able to be moved to a different table in that same waitress's section. She seemed great and in good spirits. Our new waitress wasn't very friendly or enthused about anything. We had to ask for bread and water. Both the water and bread came right around the same time as our appetizers and our second round of drinks. Maybe she was turned off by the fact that she was assigned such a large group at the end of her shift or maybe she knew she'd be leaving before we were done and just didn't care. Whatever the excuse, it was clear she wasn't going to be putting much effort into helping us.  The waiter who took over her shift really made sure that we left on a good happy note. He came in/took over halfway through our  meal and still turned the entire experience around. I'm not sure if he had to share any part of the tip with the other person who waited on us, but I sure hope not. He deserved all that and more. The food was pretty good. It did seem a little over priced for the quality, but the portions and plates themselves were huge so maybe that makes them worth it? I am not sure. I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp curry plate and it was too sweet to really enjoy. The cheesecake was delicious. Although being stuffed from the drinks, appetizers and large portions, we obviously could NOT go to cheesecake factory and NOT order cheesecake. So we took it home to enjoy once awakened from the food coma we were all about to experience. Cheesecake was good and it was a huge slice (as it should be at $8 a slice). It was basically 3 desserts in one as it lasted 2 days in the fridge so I was able to enjoy a few bites a few different time throughout those two days before I tossed the last bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=400

It doesn't matter where you're at, they're all gonna treat you the same I believe. There's an outside patio area to eat if you don't wanna be outside but then you'll be exposed to some workers taking a smoke break or shoppers tryna get a quick fix before they head in etc. There's a bar that can fix you any alcoholic drink you'd want.

Service is just okay.  Sometimes it is difficult to get your server's attention and they don't check on you enough.  Water glasses stay empty much longer than they should. Most disappointing however, is the food.  They can't ever seem to bring the bread out in a timely manner, or they will bring out only one kind of bread (and it's never the rye!).  And I ALWAYS order the farfalle.  It is my favorite forever.  I don't care if it's 87894354657653 calories.  MY FAVORITE.  So, the first time visiting Escondido TCF, I order my favorite dish that I have had many times before in Fashion Valley.  It was so disappointing that I ordered something different the next visit.  We went to Fashion Valley a month after this disappointing trip, ordered the farfalle, and we both agreed that Escondido just doesn't have a handle on the recipes.        Also, wtf is with Escondido CHEESECAKE FACTORY constantly running out of CHEESECAKE flavors?  It seems they are always out of the flavors we want to try-- as early as 6pm!   Get your shit together, Escondido Cheesecake Factory.  We may try this location again sometime later after they have had a chance to work out all the kinks and get the recipes down.  For now we will continue to drive to Fashion Valley.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=400

I paid extra for chicken to be added; good thing, because it was 99% lettuce!!  I don't know how to post a photo here, but I took one, and trust me, there were no visible vegetables AT ALL! When I told my waitress, she mentioned they were cut up into small pieces, so that's why I wasn't seeing them... She offered to bring me some more, and they were tiny pieces of beans and asparagus, but at least it helped.  I don't know if this is always the way this salad comes, or if they are trying to cut costs or something, but it was a sorry excuse for a veggie salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=400
Felicia F.,"San Marcos, CA",1,18,,2.0,7/27/2014,"Since this restaurant opened I have been about 6 different times. It seems like each time it gets worse. Either the food is not correct, it tastes horrible or more often than not the service is TERRIBLE. The most recent trip (which is prompting my writing of this) we were seated promptly but then ignored for almost 30 minutes before we complained and our waitress finally came over. I also found it annoying that she did not refill our drinks in a prompt manner. How am I supposed to eat my food without anything to drink?? She gave plenty of attention to her other tables but very rarely came to ours.....plus they were not that busy. All of the employees were just talking in the back.  The only reason I go back is because of the cheesecake.. otherwise they definitely would not receive any of my money.  Long story short... the food is relatively good but the service is ATROCIOUS...

The wait can sometimes be awhile as it gets crowded. Of course, while the food is decent, many people do go there for the deserts - after all, they aren't named the cheesecake factory for nothing!

Kristi S.,"San Diego, CA",61,1,,1.0,9/27/2016,"My friend and I went here on Monday for lunch. The reason why I'm giving this location a rating of 1 star is not because of our awesome waiter or the length of our waiting time. (which was only about 10 minutes---not bad!!)   We were let down when ordering two times!!! The menu is so large, they obviously can't manage it.  First off, we ordered the loaded tater tots and were told they would be right out. A few minutes later the waiter came back and told us if we still wanted them we would have to wait an hour! We obviously didn't want to wait an hour for tater tots so we ordered the factory nachos. The nachos were crispy but my love ended there, way too light on the toppings and nothing but the taste of salt near the bottom.  Now for our next let down.  We were done with our nachos and were ready to split a piece of cheesecake. We ordered the Kahlua cheesecake. This option was met with adoration from our waiter as he told us this was one of the best cheesecakes and that we would love it! We were totally looking forward to our dessert.  Then back comes the waiter, with a look on his face of Sorry, you're screwed again. He began to apologize and let us know they no longer carried the cheesecake. We laughed at first and were like seriously, let down again!!!!! He said he would send the manager over.  I would have to say the manager handled the situation very poorly.  He began to try and explain to us why the tater tots had to be unfrozen because they ran out the night before ....now guys, we were eating lunch at 1:00pm....you'd think they'd know they couldn't offer one of their ""popular"" menu items and let us know. He then began to tell us they 86'd the Kahlua at a meeting the night before and he just hadn't changed his menu!!!! Seriously!!!! You're fired in my eyes!

Highly recommend the chicken addition as the chicken is tender and delicious. She also had a cosmopolitan and a gin & tonic. She enjoyed both and said they were very generous with the alcohol (a huge plus for a younger crowd). We finished with the dutch apple caramel struessel cheesecake and it was incredible. The beginning started with the taste of your typical dutch apple pie and continued into a nice moist cheesecake. Incredible, just like many of their other cakes.  The service was also incredible. It only took 5 minutes to get a table at 6:30 PM. They also made sure to follow our request of outside by a heater. Only tip: Bring a sweater since only one side is next to a heater.

Cheesecake Factory.. my all time fave restaurant! *Excellent food, drinks, service, and ambiance= a great meal and time!* I've been coming to this location for about a year and a half now since it's grand opening. Before the Escondido location opened I would go to Fashion Valley once in a blue moon for friends birthdays etc, but it's nice to have one in North County.  The first time I came it was Christmas Eve 2013 dinner, within a month of the grand opening.. it was the longest wait ever for a table (1.5 hours), and the longest wait ever for the food (it felt like eternity because I was starving!). I was trying to get my family to try it, especially my parents to show how Cheesecake is the best however they weren't that impressed (I must have picked the wrong time to bring them here).  I still came back though over the past year I've done regular dining and happy hours.. every visit had been wonderful. I've had great servers and the food has been top notch. Come to cheesecake to celebrate special occasions or just because.. and happy dining!  MY FAVE ITEMS ON THE MENU: 1. Buffalo Chicken Blasts: crispy fried breaded wontons with hot sauce & blue cheese.. this is so filling!  2. Crispy Crab Wontons: fried wontons with crab and cream cheese with a sweet chilli sauce.. great appetizer!  3. Cheeseburger and Fries!.. juicy burger made just right! 4.

I always order something big intentionally so I'll have leftovers to eat later. My first visit this week, I had most of my food left but was too full, so the waitress offered to box it. She didn't put my leftovers in the bag with the rest of my family's though :( so the next day when I went to eat my food, it was nowhere to be found! Also on that visit, the waitress forgot to bring my dad's drink for the longest time and brought the cheesecake we ordered to go out on a plate. Just a bunch of little things kept happening, pretty annoying. On this last visit, just last night, everything was good, up until I got home and found that my waitress gave me the wrong cheesecake!

I guess I should've checked before I left, but when the waitress hands me a bag and says ""here's your cheesecake"", I trust the waitress. I guess I'll double check in the future. I'm just so bummed, it really sucks that their errors cost me my lunch the next day. Ughh I was so excited for that cheesecake, it looked delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=420

Kevin B.,"San Marcos, CA",11,14,,3.0,3/15/2014,"Being a server at a highly corporate restaurant, I felt as if I would fit right in with the whole Cheesecake experience. Just as I expected, there are a few things that reminded me of my personal establishment. First off, we waited past our 90 minute quote. I was a little disappointed but I know how it goes sometimes. After waiting for nearly two hours the hostess seated me at a table that clearly was not cleaned off. I was amazed, breadcrumbs all over the table which was set. I decided to take matters into my own hands and clean off the table with my napkin. Then after my girlfriend picked her napkin off of her appetizer plate we saw that the plate had in fact been used. Gross!!! The server then came by and acknowledged the lack luster table spread and addressed our concern.  At this point I was a little heated. First the wait, now a dirty table. I mean I know things happen but it was starting to get the feeling it wasn't going to get any better! Maybe it just wasn't my day!!! With that said the rest of the meal was great. The food was timely and very tasty. The mac and cheese balls are great! I mean you feel terrible for eating them, but they are amazing! Oreo cheesecake was great too! I feel like the prices are a bit up there. However, it's not a bad value considering the atmosphere.  Give it a shot...but be ready to wait!

Two soup and sandwich, one kids grilled cheese and one salad. 30-40 minutes later our food finally arrived. The child's grilled cheese was on a plate so hot I could not even handle it from the waitress. Something is seriously wrong in the kitchen that can't turn out 4 simple order faster that that.

Since they said they don't take reservations (we went on a saturday) my friend went early to get us on the waiting list. We started off with water and they brought us some bread. The server we had, Ashley, was really great! She gave us all the time we needed to decide on food and drinks (since we kept talking and forgetting to decide). We ordered: -Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms: I thought the sauce it came in was great, but overall I wouldn't have ordered this for myself. I'm not sure if it's usually served with pasta, but that wasn't something I was used to. -Lemon-Herb Roasted Chicken: YUM! The portion was huge! It came with some mashed potatoes and carrots. The chicken was very juicy and the sauce was great. I asked our server for some extra sauce and it took a while to come (she said they make it from scratch for each order) but it was worth the wait! Nothing special about the potatoes, and the carrots weren't bad. They were cooked, but still had a little crunch to them which I like a lot. -Skinny Long Island Iced Tea: This was great! It wasn't an overwhelming strong hit, but you can tell it packed a punch. -Passion Fruit Mojito: I don't like overly sweet drinks, so this one was just okay for me. My friend loved it though. Overall the portions (main entrees at least) were huge and worth the money. I definitely would come back here. Our server was great and we had a wonderful time catching up and filling our tummies with yummies! Oh and that cheesecake dessert menu.. there are so many too choose from!

I have to flag down a waiter to get a bread knife. We order our food it comes out I ordered Chicken Piccata the pasta was crunchy like it had sat out and dried. I complained to the waiter, he took the pasta away and I waited for the replacement. My girlfriend eats about 1/3 of her food while I'm waiting on new paste. My new pasta arrives and it better but their was still a dried clump of pasta that I set aside.

V A N E S S A R.,"San Diego, CA",281,17,,5.0,2/10/2014,"I was a bit skeptical to try out the new Cheesecake Factory in Escondido because since it's a new popular restaurant, it is quite a bit hectic when you walk in. You should definitely be prepared to wait, especially if you have a large group.  Surprisingly, the busy atmosphere was not an issue for the quality of service whatsoever! Our server Brenna was PHENOMINAL!! She was very knowledgeable of the menu, had great recommendations and was super attentive. It really does make a difference when you ask for lemons in your water, and they bring you a small cup with a handful of cut lemons. Or... before you even have to mention extra napkins, they are already placed at the end of the table. I don't think there was a moment when any of our drinks went past half empty.  Hopefully the rest of The Cheesecake Factory employees take note of Brenna's outstanding work ethic. There are SO many places to go out to for drinks or a bite to eat, that a little extra definitely makes a HUGE difference nowadays.  Thanks again Brenna! You were WONDERFUL!!!

Better service, better food and NICER staff! This was the WORST service ever! CONS: HORRIBLE SERVICE, Long waits, SLOWEST service known to man (ISNT THERE A TIME FRAME IN WHICH TO PROVIDE WATER AT THE VERY LEAST!?), little knowledge of menu (where the f is the training? Who runs this circus?)  PROS: Food was good. They text you when your table is ready so you're free to walk the mall. And the guys and the front counter are nice (should this even be a pro?) The wait was 1 1/2 hrs to start but they take your number to text you when your table is ready so that A plus I suppose. It seems like they hired people that have ZERO experience for the grand opening. It literally took 20 min for us to even get water. FUCKING WATER!!!!! They told us our table was ready, started getting the menus ready but then they girls talked for 5 min while we were standing there waiting to follow them to our table. Once seated we began to ask for water before being rudely cut off and rudely being told ""I'll be right back"" (right back took at LEAST 10 minutes). She could have at least faked a cheesy smile, but no just a storm off(...b!tch) We had our orders ready by the time she came back.  We ordered appetizers,drinks, main dishes and waters.  13 min later our water comes! During this time I asked for waters and was told to please hold while she places our food orders. (Ok? No problem, I know you have to go to the mountains and gather fresh stream water or the alternative and perform a rain dance)I see her what seems to be being trained on HOW to use her computer (YAY!) WATER PLEASE WE'RE F'ing DYING! She brings waters finally but  instead of kids water she brings big mugs for a 5 and 2 year old( wouldnt common sense say Kids cups? ) I had to ask a server walking by to bring us cups since we were being ignored.  Then the waitress got our drink orders wrong. Then the straws we asked for never came. From the time we sat down to the time our food came was a little over 1 HOUR! SERIOUSLY?!?!?!  She just SUCKED! DEAR GOD SHE SUCKED and I know shitty waiters!

Pony tail guy was wonderful and was always on top of our refills and always made sure we were alright. He was an absolutely fantastic waiter and I hope someone in management sees this and gives him the credit he deserves.  I ordered a margherita pizza which came out with no tomatoes. None, at all. It was just cheese bread with some basil. I was so embarrassed to send it back because I usually don't like to fuss about my food but I did. Pony tail guy was so nice about it and made sure I was taken care of.  The man who came out and apologized for the pizza being poorly made was also very nice and actually made me laugh about the whole thing. He was also surprised that there was no tomato on the pizza.

We called ahead for two days, and even hours before we got there, giving them more than enough time to get ready for our party. When we got there (an hour before we told the rest of the party) we were told we had a 3-4 hour wait time. If we didn't live an hour away and had everyone traveling here already, we would have changed the location right then and there. But we waited for our party to get there hoping something would open up within the hour. In that hour we saw groups of 5-10 people being sat before us (after our party had already arrived). I took the liberty of speaking to the manager for my friend, because she was getting very upset. When I spoke with him, he was rude and spoke to me as if he was belittling me. Since we were waiting for well over an hour, you would think he would share a little concern seeing that we had pregnant women and children that we were entertaining. No compassion whatsoever. I told him that I found it ridiculous that they could sit groups that were only 5 people (including lap babies) less than us, who had come in an hour after us. With that he pretty much told me that was how the cookie crumbled. I informed my friend and our party, and we walked across the street to BJs who were more than happy to help us.

He felt distracted with all the movement (this can be fixed by adding taller plants). There was a party of teenage girls talking really loud and squilling majority of the time we were here until they decided not to wait a 1 1/2 to sit. THANK GOD!

Kaitlyn W.,"San Diego, CA",4,14,6,2.0,7/19/2014,"First, let me just start out that the burger that I ordered was delicious. I had the Americano Burger and added egg on top - and it was wonderful. The reason that I gave this place two stars was HORRIBLE service.  The waitress that we had (I don't remember her name, but had short bright red hair - started with a 'T' if I remember correctly) was the worst that I have ever experienced. We waited about 20 minutes to sit down, which was completely reasonable on a Saturday so that was fine. Once we were seated I think we saw our actual waitress about 3 times total in the TWO hours that we were there.  It took about 30 minutes to have our drinks ordered, and about another 15 for them to be delivered to us with the bread. The white bread was horribly over cooked and tasted like it had been sitting in the oven for about an hour. Whole wheat bread on the other hand was amazing. When We ordered our drinks my sister had a water with lemon - but when it was delivered there was no lemon. Something that isn't very hard to manage. Mind you there was another man who delivered the drinks, not our waitress.  Shortly after getting drinks we placed our order (one Americano Burger - medium - with egg no tomatoes or onion, and a side salad. my sister ordered the Classic Burger -medium -  with a side of fries) It took ONE HOUR to get our food, not seeing our waitress one single time to check in on us, refill drinks, clear the table of the bread, or give us any update on how much longer.  Once we finally received the food the burgers were both cooked well done. I never received my side salad and there was about one squirt of ketchup for my sisters fries and burger. We flagged down the waitress, once again because she never checked on us, and asked for more ketchup, our drinks refilled and my salad. She made a sly comment that the kitchen staff wasn't really on their game today, which to me was a piss poor excuse as to why the service was terrible. Mind you my drink had been empty since the food was delivered. This was the last time that we saw our waitress. A busboy delivered my salad and the manager came out with our drinks. Thats when we asked for the Recees cheesecake and our check because we knew that it was going to take about another 30 minutes to receive both. The manager came out again with the desert about 25 minutes after we asked for it with the check. We did leave a note for the waitress thanking her for forgetting about us.  Under no circumstances is it okay to come to the guests only three times, one for getting our drink order, another for the food order, and once being flagged down by the guests. If we hadn't flagged her down I can guarantee that she would not have been at our table again. We were not demanding to her or spoke to her in any tone, so this was a terrible experience at such a common restaurant with decent reviews. It will be a while before I will return to the Escondido location - I would much rather drive to Fashion Valley to be respected as a paying customer rather than a hassle that you have to tend to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=480

I only gave a 4 rating, because the sweet potato fries didn't come at the time the hamburger was delivered because I guess they were over done.

Katie C.,"San Diego, CA",1,42,124,1.0,6/15/2015,So I went to lunch with my 2 year old son and niece today at 11 (it was pre lunch rush... Not busy at all) Both kids ordered elbow pasta with butter and Parmesan cheese. When my son and niece were eating I noticed this black slimy looking goop in the creases of a few of the noodles on both of their plates. so obviously not knowing what this mystery substance was I sent them both back my niece was starving so I had them re make her order and I just fed my son half of my lunch so I could avoid a meltdown. Anyways the manager came over and tried to tell us it was a basil leaf that fell into the pot of boiling water. I have never seen basil turn to the consistency of black pudding so I'm still not sure if I buy that excuse. When I went to pay the bill I noticed they had charged me for 3 kids pastas and only comped 1 even though we only ended up eating 1 kids pasta. So after much confusion and delay having to send dishes back and wait for them to fix my bill I left pretty disappointed with how they handled the whole situation.

To make things worst everyone that got seated after Us Got their drinks and food first!!! Like are you kidding me....then we get our food after about 45mins and our server didn't even come by to ask if our food was ok or if we needed anything. We had to flag him down.

After another few minutes pass, a very arrogant young man told me it would be a few more minutes. Then the same arrogant young man took us to our table. He takes us to half booth half table. I said NO, we waited about 20 minutes at this point.  He then tells us it will be a longer wait since they have to clean tables. The original hostess did apologize for the error. After a 30 min wait, we are finally seated, order, and are patiently waiting for our pot stickers, when to our surprise, out comes our entree. I ask about the appetizer, server told us she would check on it....The manager then brought them out, apologized and too them off the bill. Good gesture since I had just said to cancel them.

Bryan H.,"San Marcos, CA",87,2,6,1.0,2/18/2014,"So I took my wife to dinner for her birthday. she was pretty excited to go to the Cheesecake factory. So too were hundreds of other people. Thats okay, we expected a wait. After an hour we were called and lead out to the patio where we sat in the cold while the temps outside were in the 50's (during the recent cold snap). Wouldn't have been a big deal if the lantern things would have heated the patio, or if we'd brought sweatshirts, but we got to shivering within about 20 minutes.  Our waitress was very attentive and got us an order of nachos while we looked over the menu for our main meal. The nachos were pretty good at first but as they cooled they got bland and gross. Our meal took 40 minutes to arrive. And my plate was completely wrong. Another 20 minutes and my wife was done eating and they brought out my meal - on a plate. Not in a to go box as was asked for. Then shortly before we left a manager came over to us and apologized and walked away. No offer of a discount, or a free meal, or a pick a desert on us free. Nothin'. Just, ""hey we're really sorry, we dont know what happened...""  I've had poor dining experiences before. In fact I seem to be cursed to always be the guy whose order is forgotten or screwed up.

I set up the ""birthday dessert"" and song before she even arrived to the restaurant. Our server was nice, but not attentive at all. We had to flag down two other employees to get service mid-meal. My sister in law ordered extra sauce with her pasta and didn't receive it till we finished eating. Then as we waited patiently for the bday dessert they completely dropped the ball, no dessert, no happy birthday song. After ordering a regular dessert for her, and waiting a good 30 mins more for the bill my brother and I got fed up and went to the hostess desk to pay our bill. We split it, he paid $80 cash I paid the rest on my card. Unfortunately I didn't notice it till the next day, but they charged my card $10 more than they were supposed to, I called the store to have it fixed. Checked my statement two weeks later, nothing was fixed!! So I contacted corporate, the esco store manager contacted me, and still didn't fix the problem!!! Told me because I signed for the $10 more I should have caught it. Scammed me out of $10, which isn't much but scamming is scamming!!! Then mailed me a $20 gift card, because after getting horrible service and scammed I really wanna spend another minute at your business.

kip w.,"Escondido, CA",0,22,,4.0,5/31/2014,"We ate at the Cheesecake Factory in Escondido last night and I was really surprised at how good the food was. I had a pulled pork sandwich and it was excellent. Tender, juicy, a smoky flavor that was very smooth and a sweet sauce that actually complemented the meat. So often sauces overpower the meat (just as well as often the meat is crappy) but in this instance it was a perfect balance. My wife had the Pit Beef Dip. Man that was a huge success. Again the sauce (au jus) was really great. Lots of flavor and well seasoned. The meat was tasty, fontina cheese was an excellent accompaniment, the horseradish sauce was tangy without being overbearing. In general I find Escondido to be a food wasteland, so this was a pleasant surprise. The sandwiches were well thought out and well executed. Last week we ate at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in Vegas and the flavor profiles at the Cheesecake factory were more interesting and better layered. They have a huge selection of food which is nice as so many chain restaurants do ""theme"" food like Mexican or Italian. My only gripe was that they had a huge selection of chicken dishes but very few beef or pork choices. How excited can you get about chicken? Oh yeah we got a slice of the Chocolate Fudge Tower cake to take home. It was huge, moist, thick and fudgy and was definitely a wow finish. We'll go back and try some other stuff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=500
Sam S.,"Escondido, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/21/2016,"This place has excellent burgers, but they aren't worth the wait. Two visits ago, I ordered a well done Old fashioned or classic burger, which is very thick and delicious, as I always did. I ordered it 100% plain, the easiest order ever. When everyone else's food came, they informed me they had accidentally put cheese on my burger and started cooking me a new one, and said it would be 40 minutes to an hour. Considering it had already been 40 minutes to an hour, I decided to settle for an order of kids chicken strips. 40 minutes to an hour later, they also brought me a burger. When we paid, they had comped the chicken strips and the burger, plus given me a free slice of cheesecake. Fast forward to our next and final visit. Since I gave them the benefit of the doubt, I ordered the same thing as last time. Another person ordered the same thing with everything on it except cheese. When our meals come, I surprisingly get exactly what I ordered, and once all but the other burger arrives they inform us the other burger had cheese put on it. So she said she'd just take chicken strips as a substitute, which took about 20-30 minutes. None of us had eaten during this time, so all our food was cold by the time we could eat together. At the end of the meal, no burger had arrived or cheesecake been given to us. When we were paying, I checked the receipt, and they had charged us for the substitute chicken strips. We had the newer but not new manager come over to our table and explained to her our problem. She seemed less than apologetic, though she did unhappily comp the chicken strips. At this point, we didn't even mention the salad they had messed up and simply left. I can proudly say we will never come back to this location again. The single star given is for the delicious food. If you are in this area, I would suggest BJ's or another one of the many restaurants in the area, rather than waiting over an hour and a half for a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=500

The only thing I could complain about is that sometimes I come here and it is soooo packed that it takes a good while before you can head inside to be sat. If it were a bigger place, I'm sure that wouldn't happen often but this location is pretty small for a Cheesecake Factory. When I order I usually get the buffalo blasts as and appetizer and they are never skimpy on those. I always have plenty to take home. My go to dinner is the meatloaf. I usually don't trust meatloaf unless it's mine but one day I was really craving it and I came here so I thought, ""why not"" and ordered it. I have no regrets. Super delicious.

My BIGGEST bone to pick with the cheesecake factory is the menu. I've been to the Cheesecake factory about 15-20 times. So, to say i'm not a fan isnt fair. I'm  really torn about giving The Cheesecake Factory 3 stars or 4 stars. I JUST LOVE CHEESECAKE!  Its a weakness of mine. But with 13 pages of food menu with 30+ different dishes at 13$ + per dish, you HAVE to master all these dishes. I try to order something different all the time but with the prices they charge, it's just risky...  Here's the thing.  - The burgers are different. Some are good but thats as far as the burger menu can go.  -The salad menu is good and the portions are HUGE! The Ranch dressing is great and it goes well with everything. -The pasta menu can be good. Some are really good (Louisiana chicken is my favorite).But the few other pasta dishes Ive tried  were  only decent.  -The sandwich menu is very questionable to me. I think Ive only ordered a sandy twice from there and after that I gave up. At the price, you would expect a restaurant to have the sandwich menu mastered with their own take and twists on basic sandies.  At the least they need to be stacking these sandwiches high with meat. They dont have that. The service is alright.The only complaints I have is that the waiters/waitresses need to relax and people time to decide with the menu they have and the p[rice we pay. I could go on but I think you should be getting the idea by now. Overall, its good but confusing to me.

Laura K.,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, CA",472,148,38,3.0,12/9/2013,"I have to say that I was very excited when they began building a Cheesecake Factory in North County. I'd also like to say that the reason my review is 3 stars is the wait. I was so excited to get to try this new location for my mother-in-law's birthday. We went here on a Thursday night so it shouldn't have been too crazy although they just opened recently and most everyone that I know in North County is more than happy that they're open. The waitress that we had was incredibly nice and professional with her service. However, every step of the process took 20 minutes or more. We waited to get in for more than 20 minutes which is expected for Cheesecake Factory and just something that you should accept if you're going to go here. However, from the time we were seated to the end process took 2 hours and 10 minutes. I'm going to attribute this to the fact that the restaurant just opened and I plan on going back in the future to give it another try.  The food was good as always. I got the chicken and biscuits. The manager came over and kindly expressed that they were out of the gravy and were willing to make a different type of gravy for it. I was okay with that and the substitute gravy was delicious. The only thing that I would change is that I wished there was more gravy and I'm not one of those smother it w/ gravy kind of girls. My mother in law got the crispy chicken costoletta which was awesome! I plan on getting it next time I go. My husband got the cajun chicken littles which he loves and orders practically every time that we go here. My father-in-law got a chicken Caesar salad which he appeared to enjoy. 3 of us had cheesecake (2 had the peppermint one and I had the tiramisu cheesecake). My father-in-law had carrot cake which he loved.  I wish that I could give this location a better review because their staff were professional and their food was good.

We frequent the rancho cucamonga and Anaheim locations so we are very familiar with the food. 1) service is very bad. We had a great waitress to end our meal but the first one wasn't very attentive.  We were happy when she came back after a million hours and told us she was leaving. 2) the food wasn't what we were used to. I ordered the breaded chicken dish with mashed potatoes (which had a grayish looking color and we're COLD), and asparagus (that were soooooooooooo limp and cold). The sauce was non existent and sucked up by the not so great chicken. We also ordered the Buffalo blasts that are normally a little more cheesy and not so runny with sauce. Bit into one and it burned the crap out of my mouth and hand and lacked the flavor we are both used to. Her and I both shared each others food and this is the only place we had food at the entire day. We both end up sick. I call to complain, not even demanding anything and he tells me since I was the only complaint he can't really do much and corporate would get back to me. 1) I've worked in the restaurant business for almost 10 years. 2)Being that I'm a customer I should be RIGHT and my coming back should mean something.  Obviously it didn't.

Ket I.,"San Diego, CA",43,10,,2.0,11/24/2014,Celebrating my sisters 29th birthday! Everyone showed up at 6pm with anticipations of being seated by 7pm but the case was we weren't seated until 8:05pm! Ok nothing said we understand of the business. So after hanging out at the bar for 2 hours and because we were a tad bit loud and easily relaxed yet super friendly we were cut off by 10:00pm! This is extremely offensive! Not that we already felt they say every single party of 2/3's after us when they could have sat them at a bigger booth but seriously how understanding and accommodating as we were without being upset of being seated 2 hours after the fact and how disorganized of our orders that my food came out extremely wrong yet after along a comment they didn't feel the need to put our minds at ease and how unfriendly our servers were because of how bias they might feel towards us we still tried to make the most of our experience! Bartenders were extremely friendly and accommodating as possible knowing that we have been waiting for that long of a time frame! I don't know you tell me how singled out and prejudice we felt just being in the atmosphere and how attentive they were to other races! My party alone spent well more than enough amount of money with minimal 20% tips per every tab and bill! I just can't believe this still occurs and at a well known franchise like CheeseCake Factory! So tell me how drunk do you really think I am for writing this review after you presumed that I was intoxicated...! How dissatisfying and a slap in the face!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=580
Sue H.,"San Diego, CA",40,10,,1.0,5/21/2014,Just left from eating here and my husband and I spent out whole meal swatting two different sized gnat type of bugs. We got totally grossed out having to constantly shue them off our good or us. We told our waitress who got the manager Rebecca. She didn't seem surprised and cared even less. Her explanation that it was probably bugs from the patio didn't fly. We were not by patio or front doors and other tables didn't seem to have the infestation we did. We stood outside talking for a few minutes before we left and never had a bug. The staff had no skill set to make us want to return again.  We will never eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=580
Mindy O.,"Escondido, CA",0,32,2,4.0,2/23/2014,Great food and desserts. The servers we had have been friendly and professional. It's just the LONG WAIT is negative. We went there right after 9:00 at Saturday night and still waited for 20 min. They have limited booth seating and reserve them for large parties.

Celine N.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/27/2014,The worst wait ever. The hostess told my family that it was a 20 min wait. When it was pass 20 mins the hostess said we were up next to be seated. It was soon over an hour. Never did she tell us that the wait was going to be over 20 mins or give us a choice to leave. The manager threw in two appetizers to make up for it but still...really bad costumer service when it came to hosting. Hopefully the actual server does well,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=580
Russell H.,"San Diego, CA",0,28,,4.0,5/16/2014,"First, let me say that I am an unabashed fan of this company and have eaten at its restaurants all over the place. I have eaten widely from the menu and constantly enjoy high quality offerings.  But I have discovered a current favorite dish: Spicy Cashew Chicken. Fantastic. It is a little on the sweet side but if you like that . . . this is for you. It is a spicy, Mandarin-Style dish with green onions and roasted cashews, served over rice. It is the kind of dish you can begin to crave. As always with the Cheesecake Factory, the serving size is huge. I am a very healthy eater and cannot finish it. Also, I am not a drinker but because my business associate and lunch companion was raving about the Pina Colada, I took a taste. Wow. Perfectly icy, frothy and delicious. My companion, who is a drinker, says it is about as good as he has ever tasted. I forget what he had -- I think it was the Chicken Enchiladas -- but we both agreed it was just fantastic fare.  This company continues to impress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=580
Chris K.,"Mesa, AZ",4,7,,3.0,3/26/2014,Food was great as usual. The waitress was overwhelmed and took entirely too much time to get our dessert.

Ryan P.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,6,17,1.0,3/21/2015,"People aren't kidding, this place is very crowded. They are obviously understaffed. We waited for 45 minutes for a group of 4 to be sat on a Saturday at 3 pm. While we were waiting the host stand was crowded with people and barely any hosts. Sometimes the host stand was left completely empty and people were clueless on how to check in. When we went to get sat, someone stole our table so then they made us wait for 15 minutes to get sat again somewhere new. We finally got sat, and our server was no where to be found so we had to stop someone else to go and get our server so we could at least get waters. By the time she came over, we were ready to order everything because we wanted to get our food and get out of the restaurant. Throughout our time she constantly forgot to bring drinks, butter, lemon, bread and we had to remind her. This restaurant needs to be more staffed. The fact that this is such a well known restaurant that has so many locations, they should know how to staff for a busy location.

Stephanie M.,"Kearny Mesa, San Diego, CA",28,12,4,1.0,9/24/2014,"Don't waste your time here. A complete waste of time and money.  I won't ever be returning. After a long wait for a table we were sat and didn't see a server for 20mins. At that point she was very attentive and took our order quickly. Then we waited some more. Over an hour more. At which point the manger approached us and said they had mistakenly delivered my husbands meal to another table. We were then informed it would take another 20 mins to prepare a new meal and then they immediately delivered mine...which was cold. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta which I was warned was spicy. It was not spicy. It was completely tasteless. So much so that I didn't even eat it. In the meantime the manger has offered to bring my husband more bread and he sat and ate bread while I picked at my tasteless pasta. My husbands Chicken and Biscuits finally arrived at the point he had devoured obnoxious amounts of bread and I was done picking at my tasteless pasta.  We were ready to leave but my husband was looking forward to his dish so he dug in. It was total crap. Again completely tasteless. We had been in the restaurant now for over 2 hours and completely disgusted with our experience. Our server never did return until showing up with our bill. They didn't even bother to comp any portion of the meal and so we paid and left.

Parmy C.,"Escondido, CA",15,42,5,5.0,12/8/2013,"Went in with the family at 4:20 to request a table for five. We were told it would take 1 1/2-2 hrs & they would send us a text when our table was ready. We shopped around the mall and our table was ready right at the 2 hr mark which we were prepared for so we didn't mind.  We started with ahi tartare and fried calamari. Both dishes were DELICIOUS! The ahi was more fresh than ahi we've had in Maui & the calamari was crispy on the outside but juicy and tender on the inside and came with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce which were both great. For dinner, my husband had the southern fried catfish, I had the cajun jambalaya pasta with shrimp and my teenage daughter had the four cheese pasta. My two younger daughters ordered pasta from the kids menu and the portions were quite large for kids portions. My dish was good but I will most likely order a different dish next time, as it was a little bland for my taste. The fried catfish was delicious, moist and came with mashed potatoes, green beans and corn. My daughter said her pasta was good but I did not try it. We were all stuffed so we ordered cheesecake to go. We had the smores cheesecake, strawberry, red velvet and vanilla which were all ok in my opinion. Our server, Michael, and the rest of the staff were very attentive. Drinks were refilled promptly, the food came out in a timely manner and empty dishes were promptly taken away.

Rob H.,"Murrieta, CA",1,13,4,5.0,3/11/2014,The food was all perfectly cooked. The items all came out quickly. The waitress was extremely friendly. The host and waitress were very helpful with accommodating our one year old as far as seating and finding and area out of the way from the majority of customers. We sat outside. I assumed the tables am chairs would e dusty or weathered. This was not the case. Everything was well cleaned and maintained. The heaters were well placed and kept a all toasty. The only downside to the outdoor seating was that the sum was setting directly in our faces. This is not the fair of the restaurant. It was just irritating and there was no relief other than holding menus in front to block the sun. I would record inside seating to avoid this issue.

Darline D.,"Escondido, CA",393,205,599,3.0,1/13/2014,"I went again with my boyfriend on Thurs Jan 9th just to test out the waters if they have since made up for our horrible service last time I made a review. We went on a Thursday night where it wasn't so busy but there was still a wait of 50mins, as we were told by the guy who was adding us to the wait list. He asked us if we preferred sitting inside, outside, or had no preference and the boyfriend said ""inside because last time we were outside it was pretty bad"". Haha! I'm pretty sure that stung a little for the host (maybe he saw the yelp reviews?). So we gave him one of our cell phone numbers and proceeded to walk around and window shop in the mall. Not even 30mins of waiting time and we already got our text to come back and get seated. Wow! We walked back to Cheesecake Factory and was seated almost instantly. Chris E., according to our bill, was our server and man was it a breath of fresh air. We had EXCELLENT service! Once we were seated we were able to get our drinks and appetizer (no bread if we order an appetizer?) within about 15mins which is pretty fast. Our sever came back numerous times and was really attentive. Food of course was still delicious. I gotta hand it to the chefs inside for always bringing out quality food in a quick and timely fashion. The bartender was also pretty good that night making our three drinks (boyfriend's 2nd mojito was definitely amped up a little on the rum and was a nice addition). Got our bill, gave our server a hefty tip (unlike our last time...) and was out there in no time rubbing our full bellies and strolling to the car. Thank you for a better service!  I only added 1 more star because I feel that service can be a hit or miss depending on how busy the place gets, and maybe on who serves you. If I had excellent service all the time I'd totally give my 4.5 stars but because of the ranging service I'm giving this place 3-ish stars. You're better off getting here on a non-peak day to get great service....and maybe also better than you sit inside. Ha!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=260

I'm sure it was important though. Luckily there were two seats at the bar which my wife was happy about because the bartender looked like a damn Calvin Klein model. So much for date night.  The food was 'ehh'. Entirely too much radicchio in the greens mix and the celery that came with our 'buffalo chicken blasts' looked like they were the scraps that you typically remove from the stalk before serving.  Like the end with all shriveled tips and leaves... wtf? What kind of name is Buffalo Chicken Blasts anyway? I thought I was reading the kids menu. The tempura battered fish tacos were somewhat confusing. I've eaten quite a few  tacos over the years and... let's just say these tacos were upside down. I'm not sure if I liked the pickled onions but they make sense I suppose.  Overall the service was ok. Nothing spectacular. Although my wife probably feels otherwise. Most everybody there seemed to be content with there experience.

The table that was seated next to us was really upset that his table was dirty and he was seated at the same time we were seated. Our server took our drink order and left to input that into the computer  system. I proceed to follow her and tell her that it was my spouses birthday and if she could put happy birthday on her dessert plate and she told me yes and even told me it would be on the house (choice of cheesecake or a different dessert). I returned to my seat and a few minutes later the server returned with a different server and told us they are changing shifts and the new server would be taking care of us. New server stated that she got the drink order but didn't say the special desert order but I wasn't worried because I thought she didn't want to state that in front of my spouse. Spouse ordered chicken Alfredo, it had so much Alfredo sauce it looked like soup. She had to pour some out. Once dessert time came , we ordered the celebration cheesecake! She dropped off the desert and check at the same time , I was so upset that she didn't write nothing. After I explicitly told the previous server to write happy birthday!  We were still charged for the cheesecake. Extremely disappointed, will not be going back to this establishment anytime soon.

Then when she comes back she literally rips the napkin off my mother's drink to pick up the ice....I've never seen anything like it. So inappropriate. Finally, we get a new server, Alyssa. I guess she was on her break. She brings a basket of bread which were cold and rock hard. When I asked for a fresh basket, she paused and said, ""Umm ya maybe, I have to check if we have any and if we don't it will probably be like 5-10 minutes.""  Maybe I'm being whiny, but I work in the service industry and I know how to treat/speak to customers and this is NOT the right way!

Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",90,396,826,2.0,8/24/2014,"The quick of it: Food is good by Cheesecake Factory standards.  The downside is that this is the inner circle of hell where service goes to die a slow and tortured death. -------------- Sum-up of our almost 2-hour sojourn here at the Cheesecake Factory for dinner: Waiter: ""Would you folks like to order dessert?"" Me: ""Do we look like we have fucking time left for that!?!"" -------------- Excited for a new location closer to us than Fashion Valley, we made a trip from the coast for a night out shopping and dining.  Got there around 5:00pm with a hungry toddler and found the restaurant busy, but not packed, and only a 20 minute wait to be seated inside or out on the patio immediately.  We chose the latter so our son could eat quicker and asked for a high chair. Walking out into the oubliette ... whoop, patio, I meant to say patio, we were greeted with the warm sun on our faces, blinding low in the summer sky, and found that our table not only had no way of shielding us from this glaring brilliance that blazed like the unblinking eye of Ra, but also that no one bothered to bring a high chair.  After pointing this out, we were offered a booster seat ... for a squirmy 18 month old ... apparently they were loathe to move the umbrella that was covering nothing to make room.  We forced them to anyway and I sat down leaning forward to keep the sun out of his eyes. After 10 minutes and three other servers wandering by without paying any heed, we finally met our own waiter, a well meaning guy that was happy to take our drink orders.  Then we sat there, sun glaring down, my girlfriend slowly developing a nice burn, yet thankful for the cool wind blowing.  We quickly knew what we wanted to order, but were left to our own devices for a good 15 minutes. Then our drinks arrived!  And they were nice enough to bring bread!  As my son dove into the hard sourdough like a Gitmo prisoner coming off a hunger strike, our waiter asked if we wanted any appetizers to start.  Even the toddler stopped and gave him a look of incredulity.  Very patiently and nicely, we mentioned that we were actually ready to fully order, which we did.  But we were then left to stare at our drinks after he left because, even though we had asked initially, we were brought no Sweet 'n Low for our tea and no lemon for our water. We asked again, we sat ignored for a while again, we finished the bread, we eventually got our zucchini appetizer and a bowl of lemons with sugar after another 15-20 minutes of elapsed time. -------------- Excerpts from ""Dialogue of a Cheesecake Factory Waiter"", Escondido Edition: Waiter: ""Let me bring you more bread while you wait."" *Waiter leaves* *15 MINUTE INTERMISSION* *Waiter returns empty handed* Waiter: ""Would you like more bread while you wait?"" *Pause for laughter as the family stares in shock* -------------- We did get that second basket of bread, along with our food, over an hour after we first arrived.  My girlfriend did not have her tea refilled until about halfway through the meal, quite rough considering they just left us in the sun to sweat.  I was okay with my water, but only because I was able to steal the glasses of everyone else at the table.  And the food was good, standard Cheesecake Factory fare as I noted above. But, holy shit was that service bad.  We once watched our waiter come out to the patio, stand in front of a computer, and work on it for a good 8-10 minutes before going back inside ... while leaving a tray on top of it with someone else's ice tea and our bowl of lemon slices on it.  And there they sat in the sun for a few more minutes before he came back out and took care of it all. We also witnessed two other servers sitting down at an empty table and talking for 15 minutes.  I was under the impression that it was a manager telling a new girl what a good job she was doing ... you know, because ... IRONY! -------------- Selected scenes from ""A Night at The Cheesecake Factory,"" or ""Send in the Clowns!"" Waiter: ""Here is the coke for your son."" Me: ""We didn't order that .. he's only 18 months old!"" Waiter: ""He doesn't like soda?"" -------------- So, about 2 hours later we finally gave up on our guy and flagged down another server for to-go boxes and the check.  Our waiter was nice enough to say that he WOULD have put our leftovers into boxes for us if he had the chance to do so, but who has that kind of time? After assuming that we would be done in about an hour and have some time left for shopping after, we ended up with just a 40 minute sprint through the mall to check out stores we really wanted to see and then leave to get our son down for bed in good time. Thank you Cheesecake Factory ... you have soured North County Mall for us forever.  We could have come back to adopt a puppy from their pet store, but now that puppy will go unloved ... all because of your horrible service.

We were planning only to sit or a quick afternoon tea and snack after shopping, we order just the two items to share, but it took forever for the food and we ended up so hungry and finished the items within 15 mins.  Total time there was about 1.5 hrs with almost an hour waiting and 15 mins eating.

Debbie R.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/11/2014,"When we arrived at 4:30 p.m. They said we could sit inside for a wait of 10 minutes or we could be immediately seated outside. It was warm so I chose inside. 15 minutes later I checked in with the hostess who looked at her computer screen and then turned around and talked to three other staff members and then told me that they were just waiting for a table to open up, they had issued many checks and they were waiting for the payments to be processed. 15 minutes later now it's 30 minutes since I arrived I go back to the hostess desk and the same thing happens. The hostess looks at the computer screen turns around to chat about my situation with 3 other staff members and comes back and tells me that they have to wait for a two seat table to open up and that I am the only one not seated.  DurIng this 30 minutes I saw approximately 20 parties be seated at tables. The message was regardless of when you come in we are not sitting 2 people at a four topper. I was very upset because I really enjoy eating at the Cheesecake Factory.  I walked back to the hostess table after a 35 minute wait and told him I could not wait any longer and left. This is no way to take care of your customers. I know Sunday is a busy time but after seeing 20 parties seated before me when they came in after me is just so insulting.  I think the staff and management needs to be trained better in how to treat people in customer service. I am very disappointed.  When I walked out of the restaurant I saw no less than 4 empty tables inside and  5 empty tables out on the patio but none of them were for 2 people so they just made us stand and wait.

One hour passes and there is no notification, an additional 30 minutes pass with no news and we decide to go check with the hostesses who informed us that we were next to be seated. We wait a bit longer, still aren't seated, and are then told by the manager, who happened to be at the desk, that although we have waited longer than the quoted wait time, there is another party of four ahead of us.  I imagine the food must be very good, how else to explain such a crowd?

Elle K.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,26,3,1.0,12/31/2015,"What a terrible way to spend New Year's Eve! We checked in at the Escondido Cheesecake Factory at about 5 pm, looking for a table (for me, my husband and our baby). We were told 40 minutes, but that we should come back in 35. So we walked around the mall, then returned and waited from 5:35 until 6:10 when we finally left -- an hour and 10 minutes after we checked in, and 30 minutes after we were told we would be seated. I understand: it's New Year's Eve and it's busy. Fine. The problem is that when we checked with the front desk, we were told it would ""only be a few minutes"" and that we were ""next"" over and over, and yet they continued to seat tables of two and four ahead of us. They were obviously skipping over us -- I don't know why they could not have given us one of those tables of two or four. Finally, after we were told we were next and then they proceeded to seat another group of four ahead of us, we just left. There's only so long one can keep a baby entertained in a restaurant waiting area, and by 6:10 it was getting too late. It really ruined my NYE because, as parents, we only have a certain window of opportunity to dine out in the evening ad. Have an overpriced meal. A 40 minute wait would have been within that window. A. Hour and a half was not. So disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory. They really need to train their people better. If they'd told us the wait was over an hour, that would have been fine. If they had seated us instead of skipping over us, that wound have been great.

Kevin M.,"San Marcos, CA",0,125,1,4.0,4/28/2014,"This review is based off of two separate visits. I cannot recall the exact days but what I do recall is that our female server (a younger African-American server who told us she is studying at CSUSM) was very friendly, warm, and had a lot of suggestions to offer when we were interested in exploring new dishes; she also knew her menu quite well. Everything was great with her and our time there was enjoyable. I was considering giving a three star review simply because the server that took care of us the second time was not good at all and had zero personality, nor did he seem to even care about interacting with us or giving us service. He appeared annoyed that we had already purchase our libations (drinks) at the bar before sitting down or maybe that we were conversing in Spanish at the table. Originally, there was a 45-minute wait for a table so we decided to grab some cocktails to hold us over before sitting down at our table of four. The service area that really shined was the bartenders. There were two male bartenders working two Saturday nights ago and not only were they super friendly but super accommodating. The regular mojito I ordered was amazing, and I am usually very critical of mojitos since I make them at home but this one was top notch and I told the bartender it was one of the best I have had (he was working the service station/well for all restaurant orders). Anyways, the two bartenders that served us even offered to walk over one of our guest's hot teas to the table where we were moved when our table was ready. Now that is service! It was until our experience started with our server that it was a total let down. We dropped over $150 at the table but he couldn't be bothered with anything and was pretty much non-existent the entire time. I believe this was around 9 or 10 p.m. two Saturdays ago. Other than that, I would chalk it up to a 2 out of 3 situation. I would just simply ask to have another server next time so that somebody who is waiting on us actually appears to even have some small percentage of satisfaction in what they are doing because he apparently did not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=600

Veronica C.,"Escondido, CA",133,151,45,2.0,1/15/2014,"I'd hate to give my favorite restaurant a less than okay review, but they need to change their policy for making reservations.  My first time here at this new location was for my friend's birthday. She called in advance and tried to make reservations for a party of 8, but she was told that it was ""not a large enough"" party to reserve for.  They did however, encourage for the whole party to walk in because they can ""easily accommodate"" the party.  We arrive and end up waiting ONE HOUR for a table.  I am 7 months pregnant, and that was just very miserable to have to wait that long.  When we were finally seated, they gave us complimentary appetizers of wontons, avocado eggrolls, and calamari.  We enjoyed them greatly!  Along with our entrees. I had my usual Miso Salmon that I never fail to order at this restaurant.  Our dining experience with our food was amazing as usual but does not entirely make up for the fact that we always have to wait this long whenever we dine as a group. Me & my friends love this place for their food, & it's too bad a good food experience can't be shared with each other without an ungodly wait. I would love to come here for my birthday, but this business is not group-friendly. This is not the first i have had a long wait experience despite attempts to make a reservation. Like I said, I really wish they would change their reservation policy.  It is unreasonable. They did not find us large enough to reserve seats for in advance BUT found us large enough to automatically charge gratuity.

Would have been nice to have been told this 45 minutes ago or when we first put our name in.  What restaurant doesn't do reservations for larger parties????  They might want to rethink that so they don't have more angry customers waiting FOREVER for a table.  All in all I would not come back due to poor planning on their part.  Being in the restaurant business, customer service is the key for repeat customers, otherwise they will be loosing a lot of business to BJ's just across the way!!!  Wish we would have gone there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=600
Jules K.,"Escondido, CA",1,13,6,2.0,3/8/2014,"So I went with my friend to go eat some brunch today and our server was Alyssa. She was okay at first then she forgot our straws that we asked for and our bread that we asked for. 15 minutes later she comes back with the straws and tells us that our bread is baking, when clearly we see other servers bringing white bread to their tables. We had to ask another server for bread which he did bring and was very polite. After she forgot our straws and bread I was a little upset, but didn't make a big deal because I figured she was new because she didn't even know the menu. My friend ordered a salmon lunch special and she asked her what kind of rice she wanted with it when it doesn't even come with rice and then she never once came and asked how our food was. Now we're still pretty understandable at this point because we are servers as well and we understand servers forget things every now and then. However, I got upset when she passed our table on to a busser and was talking about us with her other coworkers. We could obviously tell she was complaining about us and talking bad about us.. There were 3 girls standing just pointing and staring at us. I felt very disrespected when a busser got us boxes and closed us out. Isn't that a servers job? I mean she was only on a 4 table rotation, well 3 since she gave up on us. I just felt that it was very unprofessional to give up on a table, if a table is upset you fix it, not run away and have a busser handle it when it's not even his job. In conclusion, the food was good and the workers were friendly and nice, but this girl has to go. She is rude and on top of it all she had a big hickey on her neck about a size of a golf ball. How unprofessional! I would definitely go back here but I will never ever sit in her section again.  Sorry Cheesecake Factory for giving you 2 stars but it really bugged me how she handled us just because we were young.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=600

She apparently had requested to leave early that day and her manager would not let her go. We heard all of this as she complained to another waitress about 5 feet away from us. She then came back to take our food order before we even ordered drinks but we went ahead and ordered our food and drinks at the same time. The waitress then disappeared for about 15 minutes so we flagged down a young man who was bussing a table behind us and asked him about out drinks he was very apologetic and asked us our drink order and said he would get them right away. We then saw the waitress standing at the bar with 3 other employees and was very apparent that she was still complaining about her earlier issue. Our food was finally delivered to our table which was great except it cam before our appetizers. ....oh wait the appetizers never came...oh wait yes they did on the bill.....we pointed out to her that they were on the bill and she got an attitude and rolled her eyes and walked away with the bill and showed the manager who then came over and offered us free desert...although we appreciated the offer we opted to pass and while he was talking to us the waitress was standing about 15 feet away from us pointed at us as she talked to another  waitress and complaining about us. At this point I was so disgusted with her attitude I just want to get out of there .....the manager offered to comp our entire check. ..but I told him the best way to fix the problem was to give his employee some counseling and training. ...I did not need a free meal....I paid the bill and didn't look back....the only reason they get 2 stars is the busser",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=600

I'm in a wheelchair and there was no easy way to get into the restaurant. The doors weigh about a million pounds and there is no handicapped button to open the doors. I had to rely on the kindness of strangers to open the doors (yes, both doors. One door could not accommodate my wheelchair); apparently the 4 cheesecake factory workers at the host stand couldn't be bothered with opening the door for a customer; let alone a handicapped paying customer. Once inside, the was no easy way to the restrooms. There are two aisles to get you to the restrooms; both aisles had baby seats in the aisles and I could not fit. I had to ask the parents of the babies to move them so I could get by. Just a little embarrassing. To top it off, the restroom was disgusting and I could not even reach the sink. I do want to point that our waitress, Marcel, was wonderful. She was attentive and kind. We asked her opinion on several things and really felt like she gave us her honest opinion.

Samin V.,"San Marcos, CA",1,42,1,1.0,6/29/2015,"Having only been to the Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Valley and in Vegas,  I was expecting typical Cheesecake factory food and service, which had always been good based on my past experiences. Unfortunately, this was not the case.  We decided to stop in last week on a Friday for lunch while we were running errands at the mall. It was pretty dead inside, so we figured we could get in and out pretty quick. We were seated immediately. Our server (don't remember her name, but a younger blond girl with tattoo sleeves) took our drink order and food order. She was less than enthusiastic, but that was no big deal. We got our drinks and while we were waiting on our food, several other people were seated. Their food came and went, but no sign of ours. Our server finally checked in on us and let us know that the food was taking longer than expected. She offered us a cup of chowder, which was nice, but mind you this was about 30 minutes after we had placed our order. I asked if the salad that came out with my pizza could be brought out sooner. She said yes (ideally, they would have done this anyway, right?) and she brought my husband a cup of chowder. A little while after that, our food finally came out. My husband had ordered a chopped salad and I had ordered a pizza. Not sure why either of those things would take so long, considering that everyone else who was seated after us had pretty much received their food. The server (a different one) then proceeded to put our orders in front of the people at the table next to us. The girl next to us all but stuck her fork in my husband's salad before we realized those were our meals and corrected the server. The server picked the salad up from the other table and basically just plopped it in front of us.  We at our meals (again, without being checked on. We had to flag our server down for drink refills) and asked for the check. When the check came, I noticed that I had been charged extra for the wrong kind of salad. I pointed this out to our server when she came back. She told me that we had been charged correctly, and I again had to tell her it was incorrect and told her the correct menu price of my order vs. what she had charged me for. At that point, she figured out she was wrong and took the check back and had it corrected.  The food was fine, but I won't be going back because of the poor service. There are plenty of other options in the mall and around the mall with better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=560

Michael S.,"Concord, CA",212,59,23,1.0,3/8/2014,"Don't believe the hype this place sucks. I don't know why this place is so popular but I have been here multiple times and each time i have had a bad experience.  The first time I came it was my friends birthday and before we could be seated we had to wait an hour and walk around the mall just to be seated outside in the cold winter night. When the waitress came with our food she spilled some fries on my wife and ruined her dress, the manager was quick about coming over to apologize and he seemed sincere. They brought over some more fries of course but i really didnt think that it was enough considering the fact that my wifes dress was ruined to the point she had to replace it. The burger I had was nothing special and really not worth 18 dollars, for four people the bill came out to 80$ and when I asked the waitress for a birthday song for my friend I really thought they were gonna bring at at least the birthday girl a slice of cake, but no they did not, after about 20 minutes of stalling they finally came and started singing but all they brought was some whip cream on a plate, considering our bill was 80$ and the fact that they had spilled fries on one of their guest you would think they could at the very least give the birthday girl a slice of cake.  Of course I understand that they are a business but even our local Denny's will give someone some came on their birthday, I was a little offended by the whip cream, if I knew they were gonna be stingy on the cake I would have been OK paying but they didn't even ask, and its not like we had already said no to desert, they just honestly didn't care about us. My second visit was with just my wife and we went in hopes that the place would redeem itself and live up to its popularity. It did not. It was crowded as usual and again we waited around an hour to be seated and again we were seated outside, luckily it was lunch time so it wasn't too cold. they were slow with everything and our waiter spent too much time handling a certain table with girls his age, I did not leave a tip. Again the food was mediocre and yet still we paid around 40$, I really don't mind the prices its just if I'm going to pay twice as much what I would at Dennys then I want at least twice the quality service and food. On this occasion I would take a Denny's cheeseburger over theirs any day. Our third trip was just as mediocre, although not a horrible experience we still had to wait the usual hour just to be seated outside for the third time. We both tried something different and were both unimpressed. Although our waitress actually paid attention to us this time the quality of the food just isn't worth the price, I really really don't understand what it is people love about this place. Yes I did try the cheesecake and yes it was good but not 7 dollars a slice good. I will not be going back to the cheescake factory for a very long time if at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=560

I didn't notice this particular location being a smaller venue compared to the mission valley location, but maybe it is? Either way I felt it had enough space. I'm quite happy they put this restaurant at the North County mall. I like the Cheesecake Factory. This is one chain restaurant that I really enjoy. I ordered from the lunch menu, which is served till 5 and the portions are still huge! I ordered the bbq ranch grilled chicken salad. Comes with corn, black beans, tomato, avocado, cucumber, romaine leaves, lots of chicken and fried onion rings on top. When my waitress brought out my salad, I thought she made a mistake and brought me the dinner portion but nope, it was the lunch size. Needless to say I definitely needed a to go box.

Jordan Z.,"San Diego, CA",13,54,14,3.0,2/24/2014,"I really want to love this place, because I heard so my hype about it, I love cheesecake, and had wanted to come here for such a long time, and finally just went here for the first time in December, and then again last night, but found myself disappointed for different reasons both times.   I understand because it just opened a few months ago that it is very popular and busy, and that the servers are still learning.  However, with that said.... My first time there we experienced great service.  Our server was friendly and sweet (wish I could remember her name, but we sat in her section near the bathrooms).  I ordered the sun-dried tomato alfredo pasta and was extremely disappointed with how absolutely bland in flavor it was.  I seriously have never had such terrible pasta.  I can make WAY better pasta at home.  Luckily, their cheesecake makes up for it, but I expected far better flavor for the price. My second experience was at the self-seating bar area (not the bar itself, but the tall, circular tables next to the bar) and I believe our server was named Krystal.  We ordered waters (which our server was probably initially irritated about because she wanted to make money off of expensive bar drinks, but we were just not in the mood for alcohol this time).  She brought us the waters and bread, but we still had no menus and no silverware.  We ask her for menus and had all of about a minute or so to look over them before she returns she asks us what we want to eat.  The menu is HUGE, what makes you think we are ready to order?  We asked her to bring us silverware, so we can actually spread butter on the bread she brought us, which takes all of about a minute or two, and when she returns with the silverware, she asks us again if we are ready.  The entire experience from that point on just felt rushed and stressful.  It seemed like our server wanted to get us in and out so she could get more customers in and make more money.  After ordering and getting our food, our hummus and pita bread was delicious, but our mozzarella triangles and spinach and artichoke dip came out luke-warm.  We were so intimidated by our server that we felt uncomfortable asking her to re-heat the food, but we mustered up the confidence to do so anyways.  As a server, you shouldn't be so aggressive that you scare your customers out of what they want.  Later on in the evening, as we are finishing up our meals, she complains to us about other customers she dealt with that night which came off as very unprofessional.  We came here for an enjoyable experience, not to listen to our server complain about her job and her four tables.  I've worked in the service industry before for many years, so I have empathy for servers when they get busy, but four tables is not that many.  Clearly, we weren't the only people dissatisfied with our server that night, because the other customers left her a note basically telling her the service sucked.  The entire evening was just awkward and unpleasant, and my boyfriend and I felt relieved to get out of there.  I'm not saying that our server should necessarily be fired, but she needs some serious training in work ethic and customer service.  A change in attitude can make all the difference, and trust me, she needs some help.  Will request my friend and old co-worker David as our server next time.  She could definitely learn a thing or two about service from him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=560

My dinner was exceptionally delicious, not too heavy on the coconut taste or sauce as a matter of fact my husband kept coming back for more after insisting he taste it.

Having guests stand outside your restaurant for hour+ waits is not evidence of success.  On the contrary, it is evidence of a restaurant that is not being managed well and is not delivering a positive guest experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=620

We weren't greeted by our server for about 15 minutes. She did not apologize for the delay. Took our drink order and I told her what we wanted for an appetizer. Received our appetizer and ordered our lunch. While waiting I asked for bread. After about 10 minutes the server said the bread was baking and would be out soon. She mentioned that she was having a tough day. Because her first table left her a religious pamphlet for a tip. And she was catholic so what were they thinking. Our food came out and our order was wrong. The girl that brought us our food took it back to be corrected. Tina said she ordered the food wrong. She checked on us once after getting the correct order. And we only sawing her waiting on others after that. We both were out of drinks, she would see us looking at her but never came back. About 30 minutes later I saw her checking out. Looking at her receipts and then she left (I guess her shift was over). We were'nt offered anything else (drinks, dessert-which we mentioned we wanted cheesecake). She just left. We at that point could have left (our $48 bill unpaid) and no one would have known anything different. I flagged down another server and she said she would get the server who was taking care of the tables behind us to help us. We told the new server about what was happening, that we had been abandoned and ignored. He didn't apologize. Just said he was a trainer and would coach her on the situation. I asked him if there was a way our tip could go to him. Because we were so disappointed in the service we had gotten. He said no. He took our cheesecake order and 10 minutes later we received our dessert. Luckily we had saved our spoons as we weren't offered silverware. We both were still out of drinks. I went up to the bar and got 2 glasses of water. The cheesecake slices were large so we wanted to-go containers. My daughter went up to the to-go/cheesecake area and got containers. We then took our check up to the same counter to pay our bill. As Michael didn't come back. He then saw us and came up to the counter and said he would process our bill. I was disappointed that I felt like I gave Michael the chance to make a bad situation better. And he didn't take advantage of that opportunity.

Brenda N.,"Vista, CA",0,15,,2.0,9/2/2014,"Very disappointed in this location of the CCF!  To bad too because it is closer to my home then the San Diego location which has great food and service.  I had been to the CCF about four months ago here  in Escondido. I went with my daughter for a birthday lunch.  I ordered a turkey burger it came out raw in the middle.  I sent it back and the waitress could not understand why. I told her you can get sick from raw turkey meat. It's not beef where if it is a little pink you can eat it. Anyway she took it back with attitude.  It came back still raw by then I had no appetite.  I asked to speak to a manager and he took it off the bill. He did apologize but no offer of a piece of cheesecake or anything. It was my birthday! They made it seem like I was crazy for sending it back. I got the district managers number on the way out. I called him the next day. He was very apologetic and sent me a 15 dollar gift card for a couple of pieces of cheesecake since it ruined my birthday lunch. My husband decided on Sunday,8/31/14,night to use out gift card for cheesecake. I was looking forward to if since I have been watching my diet and this was a splurge. He ordered the cherry CC for me and the Hershey's 30th birthday CC for himself . Well we get home and guess what they gave us Oreo CC and I thought Hershey's. I don't  like chocolate CC. I like the regular and that's why I got the cherry one.  I called and talked to Tony and he apologized and said he would send me a gift card so I can get the right CC.  Well my husband ate the second piece of CC which he had wanted the Hershey' s 30th birthday CC yesterday. Well it was chocolate peanut butter CC. So neither one if us got out what we wanted. I can't call now and yes he got two pieces of CC.  You want what you want and the receipt said cherry CC and the Hershey birthday CC. How hard is it to look at the receipt and do it right. You spend good money at CCF. I also was comparing it to the SD location which is on point. I also asked to have someone call me. No call but I did a get raw turkey burger, service with an attitude and the wrong cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=620
Eder M.,"Escondido, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/8/2014,"Worst restaurant experience ever! Told that waiting time was between 65-80 minutes. We came in on time but it's been 100 minutes and no one had texted my cell yet. I approached them and said to wait a little bit more. Finally called us after  15min. more. Overall, waiting time is way over delayed. Next, waiter came and never introduced himself and took our order. He served us bread but never gave us our drinks. We finished the bread and choking but still no drinks so I have to call someone for that. Next, we ordered appetizer but this neither was served. He came back with our entree (main order) but no appetizer and when I asked about it, he said, Oh you never got it? Hello!!!You were the one serving us! I just cancelled the appetizer of course. Lastly, I asked him to box left overs for 3 plates and just came with 2 boxes. He said he'd look for it but I told him being so frustrated already that I have spent so much time here already and I can't deal with more waiting time. You can have it!

Kim M.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/6/2014,"I have to say that my experience at the Escondido Cheesecake Factory was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant so far. I have been in the industry as a Manager/Owner/Server/GM. I think I have done all rolls and I have to say I will not go back to that location. The hostess was rude and unprofessional. We waited over 2 hours to be seated outside at night in the cold with a three year old. When asked to move inside, we waited again and never actually got sat inside. They forgot our salads. When the food came it , the weather was so cold that it turned cold very quickly. When speaking with the Manager, Rebecca, regarding our experience all she said was she would address the hostess. We ended up taking our food to go and heating it up when we got home. $100 later, cold and still hungry it was awful.

Mike G.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,3.0,11/13/2014,"I haven't been to The Cheesecake Factory in a very long time, but from what I remember the food is really good. After walking in I really loved the atmosphere and how everything was set up. The hostess was nice and our server was great.  My mother and I both ordered pasta. She got the Da Vinci and I got Fettucini with Chicken and Sun Dried Tomatoes. We were starving so when the food came out we quickly dove right in. BOTH pasta's had absolutely no flavor even though it looked delicious! I tried my my mother's dish and sure enough it was bland as well, although mine was a little worse. I had to add mountains of salt just to give it flavor. I was not enjoying it at all therefore I took most of it to-go hoping I could fix it at home. Not to mention I started to feel sick, probably from all the salt I added. I'm not quick to say something tastes bad because I eat almost anything. That's how I know this was a big fail.  I was very disappointed, knowing how much I would have to pay for a horrible meal and I proceeded to tell my mom that maybe pasta is just not their specialty. My mother then told me she had a pasta from another Cheesecake Factory only two months prior and it was delicious. So I think it boils down to the cook who made ours. I've worked in the restaurant business before and I know that the food tastes better depending on the time you go and the cook you get. So either the chef or one of the cooks has a lot of work to do. I can say that whoever made our pastas does not know how to cook at all. The only reason I'm giving three stars was because our White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake was delicious, and because the customer service was great! Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but everything should be good at a large chain restaurant like this.  Sad to say I probably will not go back to the Cheesecake Factory. There are so many less expensive-DELICIOUS food that can be had elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=360

Very hearty although a little messy because the patty kept falling apart but I didn't mind too much. For dessert, we had a lemon raspberry cheesecake which was delicious! Tasted like lemonade.

We aren't always the easiest bunch, due to substitutions, but he nailed it! Our drinks were always full, and even the bus boys were helpful. The grilled artichoke was a little disappointing and was slightly cold and raw, but had great flavor. The skinny menu options were delicious! I got the turkey avocado and was very pleased.

Robert J.,"Escondido, CA",336,515,153,4.0,1/9/2014,"This place has huge potential, but it's young, busy, and has a few kinks to still work out.  I've been in 3 times since opening, and overall, they've been great experiences.  Can't beat the Happy Hour! In general, the wait staff has been great.  zero complaints.  We've already picked a couple favorites and try to chat with them if they have time!  We've learned not to have any expectations when putting our names in.  They don't do reservations, so you never know how long you might have to wait :( The food is great.  Top notch. HH appetizers are really well done and you get a great deal for your $.  They do have an excessively large menu, but no one I've been with has had complaints.  The table bread is surprisingly sweet, but don't fill up on it!  I won't speak on the Cheesecake: I've heard it's great but actually haven't tried it myself! Drinks are awesome.  Happy Hour is great for the money, but as soon as it hits 6om, bust out your wallet because they are PRICEY (and I'm used to LA).  $12 each for a bunch of them (when $ isn't listed on the menu, you should worry).  However; very well made and delicious! There have been a couple hiccups: food was brought to someone else's table, wrong orders, etc.  If I had to pin blame, I'll stick it with the host staff and people who bring out the food (""servers""?).  We live close; we'll be here often!

Kevin M.,"San Marcos, CA",4,6,8,5.0,10/4/2014,"Good times had by all. The Escondido location was a long time coming but has finally arrived; to everybody's delight. Arrive early or expect to wait. Waiting is not that hard since you have a whole mall to pass the time with. They'll text you when your table is ready so you don't have to worry about walking out of range while you wait. This is pretty much your only option since they don't do call-ahead seating or reservations.  Portions are large. The appetizers can be meals, and if you bag half your dinner you might be able to make it through dessert. Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake is just chocolate coconut goodness. The Original Cheesecake is probably the best classic cheesecake I've ever had -- not dense at all, your fork glides right down through the moist fluffy cheesecake and through the light graham cracker crust. The thin sour cream layer adds a fresh tartness. Worried about the sour cream? It's not overwhelming and you can always balance it with a bit of the free-standing side of whipped cream.

Keysha M.,"Carlsbad, CA",140,120,617,4.0,1/13/2015,"My favorite thing about this place is seriously the service. Not once have I ever had a server who wasn't at their best. My last server, Brent (Brett?), was just amazing. He was ready with suggestions, happy to wait when I took a little too long to figure out what I wanted. He took my salad back because there was way too much seasoning on it before I even noticed the error myself. He was just crazy aware, and friendly and rolling with his A game.  This place can be hit or miss as far as the food goes. The selection is huge and sometimes a little overwhelming. I know complaining about too many options is lame but there's just something a little too much about a menu that's more of a novel than a pamphlet. I can say though that it's a great place to take a large group of people with varied tastes. You also can't go wrong with taking a suggestion from your server as they generally all recommend the same seven go to dishes. Dessert of course is a MUST. Don't bother eating dinner if you think you'll be too full for dessert...just go for the dessert and box your food up for home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=360

Rebecca L.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",1,15,,1.0,8/30/2014,"I thought about a second star but that would be entirely too generous.  I have been a consistent customer of The Cheesecake Factory for several years, I have NEVER experienced a Cheesecake a lack professionalism and class like this one.  I am normally okay with paying 100 dollar bill for two people if the service matches the price of the meal.  No such luck here - unfortunately we picked to go here on our anniversary. Waited for a table for a reasonable amount of time and occupied ourselves in the bar until our pager buzzed.  We quickly left our seats in the bar, which we had to wait for, closed out our tab and made out way over to the host.  We were acknowledged after a couple minutes with a buzzing pager I'm hand and asked to wait until someone could seat us.  That's when a pissed off server grabbed some menus, called our name even though the host has pointed us out to her, and proceeded to walk to our table, not stopping for other patrons to leave.  She then put our menus down and said, ""I'm going to be your server, l'll go grab waters and bread for you.""  Not a great first impression but she redeemed herself throughout the night.  The managers, however, did NOT.  One manager came over 15 minutes after we ordered to tell us that they had burnt my boyfriends meat loaf and had no more portions for the night.  When my boyfriend asked for his recommendation, the manager offered, ""a burger"".  Seriously? This whole menu and you choose a burger?  He ordered the enchiladas instead.   Our server came out seconds later to apologize and offer to bring my veggie burger.  No use in letting it sit under heat lamps.. But it already had.  Not only was the bun soggy, it came out with no grilled onions and... The patty was BURNT!  So I took three bites and ate my fries instead.  Our server came back with the enchiladas half way through my fries and said she would send a manager over to address the veggie burger.  This is what got me, instead of coming over, he just took my meal off our bill.  I'm not coming here for a cheap meal (obviously we were already three bar drinks and an appetizer deep when we ordered our meal) I'm coming here for the customer service!   When we asked to speak to a manager after ordering our dessert to go and paying the bill, we told him about our experience, reminding him throughout that it wasn't our servers fault.  He heard us out and then said, ""So what exactly were you unhappy with?""  Really?  We came here wanting a nice dinner for our anniversary, neither one of our entrees were up to par and no manager checked on us after they KNEW that out experience wasn't up to their chains standards.  He responded with, ""Can I get you a piece of cheesecake on us?""  If you had checked on us after the issues with BOTH of our entrees, then we would have taken a free slice.  At this point, we have already paid for one.

Super friendly and helpful host at the front desk. They take your phone number and you get a text message when your table is about ready so you're not left guessing when you should check back for your seats. Our server offered EXCEPTIONAL service throughout the meal and always checked up on us and made sure everything was perfect. Water cups were promptly refilled and orders were taken in a timely manner. The bread was brought out fresh and the table was set up perfectly. We ordered the salad, Fillet Mignon, Rib-Eye, and a Khulua Coffee Cocoa Cheesecake.  Salad: Very fresh, but the sauce was very lacking. Got to the end of the salad and there was almost no dressing left. Fillet Mignon: Ordered medium well, very tender and seared properly to keep the moisture inside.  Rib-Eye: Medium-well, a bit too dry for my taste and didn't seem like top quality meat. Cheesecake: no complaints here. Perfectly made and the same as any other Cheesecake Factory.

It is also completely fat and calorie filled but who is counting calories? I always sit at the bar when I come here because there's no way I'm going to wait an hour to be seated in the restaurant. If you do come here and I want to sit in the restaurant then I suggest that you put your name on the list way before you're even hungry. They'll take your phone number down and call you when your table is ready and then you can roam around the mall until your table is ready. They have a legit happy hour where some of their drinks and select house wines are $5. Their appetizers are also cheaper and the portions appear to look the same as a regularly priced appetizer portion. I have eaten a lot of the food and everything I've had is always good so just close your eyes and point somewhere on the menu and order it I'm sure it'll be delicious and you will love it. Try the farfalle pasta, it's to die for! If you share it with someone else you won't feel as guilty for all the calories. The fried mac & cheese balls are a must every time I come, my sister got the fried mac & cheese burger and she ordered a side of marinara sauce to dip the burger in. It sounds odd but you should try it. I never know which cheesecake to order they are all so good so again just point somewhere on the dessert menu and tell them to bring you that, then go home lay in your bed and rub your fat belly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=440
Justine S.,"San Marcos, CA",1,25,2,5.0,9/30/2015,"On Sunday we went to have brunch & we received the best service ever by our server Bryce! He was so professional,  great manners, & very attentive. The food was also amazing & this location is absolutely beautiful. The cheesecake is to die for & it is a big portion!  I can't wait to dine there again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=440
Melanie L.,"Kent, WA",39,10,,2.0,8/10/2015,"First time for me to be in the Cheesecake Factory.  It was also my sister and mothers first time too.  Factory burger that I ordered was too greasy, the bun it was on was odd shaped and really had to chew at it.  The fries were overly salty.  The waiter, though nice, was flighty and seemed to keep forgetting that our table was there. I've had better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=440
Jason I.,"San Diego, CA",53,27,22,5.0,12/3/2013,"PROS:  Everything we ordered was amazing. Get the Buffalo Blasts! Wait Staff were very attentive Place is new so cleanliness was impeccable  CONS: Wait Time, but I'm sure this will lessen as time goes If you are a North County resident, you already know we were dying for a spot like Cheesecake Factory to come in and raise the bar a bit.  We will be regulars for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=440
Melanie C.,"San Diego, CA",29,59,89,4.0,2/21/2014,"Nice store location. Very clean and customer service was great. I placed an order to-go cause I was shopping with my lovebug.  The portion on my lunch pasta was just right. They seem to give more food than CPK.    Delicious pastas, but watch out.. If you are counting calories, Farfalle Chicken with Roasted Garlic is over 2100 calories!!! :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=440
Kate S.,"Poway, CA",1,20,56,5.0,9/18/2015,"Came here for my son's birthday dinner tonight. This is where I go when I feel like pigging out!! The wait here is absolutely ABSURD! However, when it comes to food, I can wait! My favorite plates...Miso salmon..Jambalaya Pasta..Bang Bang shrimp..Mango/Luau Salad. We left with Red Velvet Cheesecake. Holy cow, one of the best Cheesecake that I've eaten in a long time. It was memorable bday dinner. You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory! So many things to choose from, great small plates and Cheesecake for days!! We're definitely coming back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=440
Brandon W.,"Dallas, TX",93,74,4,1.0,6/27/2015,Service was good so I should start with that. All of the food was not very good and my wife found two gnats in the harvest chicken salad. They did credit us back for that salad though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=440
Deirdre R.,"Poway, CA",2,75,,4.0,7/27/2015,"This is a GREAT location of the Cheesecake Factory.  Friendly staff, generally timely service, fun atmosphere.  I prefer this Cheesecake Factory to BJ's across the parking lot.  Different vibes, but I find myself a the Cheesecake Factory much more often than BJ's.  The neat thing about this and all Cheesecake Factories is the number of menu items and the ability of the staff to vary the ingredients of a good number of items to taste.   There is truly something here for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=440
Marianne I.,"Temecula, CA",6,7,,4.0,7/23/2015,"Arrived here at 5:10 pm and by 5:28 our order was hot, fresh and on the table. The Club was delicious and large enough to feed 2 or 3 of me. My companion (my 7 year old granddaughter) loved her mini corn dogs but felt that the thin, sharp sticks they are served on could be a bit dangerous to the under 7 crowd :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=440
Mel F.,"Carlsbad, CA",4,77,57,3.0,4/20/2014,"Our server was super nice!! We sat outside the patio for Easter brunch. It was very busy! Despite the chaos, she was very attentive to our needs. We were sent out without set ups, which was not a big deal ... until our entrees came.  Appetizer: Avocado egg rolls. They were good! I'd buy it again.  Entrees: My dad got the katsu, which it said was good. Except the sauce was very salty. My mom enjoyed her carbonara. My brother enjoyed his burger. My husband ordered the Baja chicken hash from the brunch menu. He barely had chicken in his dish and it was very salty. I ordered the crab hash and it was doused with pepper. I like spicy, but this was just an over load of pepper, and yes ... they use real crab.  We tipped our server 20% because she was attentive and very kind. I am giving it three stars because the food was not as good as it was my last visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=440
Sabz S.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/24/2016,"I ordered for pick-up so, this rating is solely based on the food. My family ordered the GF Turkey Burger and the Thai Salmon, which they seemed to enjoy. I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. In the description it mentioned that the shrimp is marinated in a ""Very Spicy Jamaican Black Pepper Sauce."" I ordered it because I thought it was spicy. I even added some hot sauce and still the sweetness of the shrimp sauce was overbearing. The shrimp was very sweet and there wasn't even the slightest amount of kick to it. Therefore the pineapple and plantains on the side did not go well with the sweet shrimp. The whole dish was too sweet. The black beans and rice were like any other black beans and rice. It's hard to mess those up, but they were good. I love cheesecake factory, but this dish just wasn't up to par with what I'm used to. The description of the dish needs to be changed. I will probably go with my regular favorites from the restaurant next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-escondido-2?start=440
