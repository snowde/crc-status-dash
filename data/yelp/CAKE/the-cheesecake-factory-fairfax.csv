Elizabeth W.,"Fairfax, VA",53,15,17,4.0,12/20/2017,I only have one negative.  The wait after we got to our table was 20 mins long. We had been there almost 45 mins before even getting to order food. We were a party of 9 goin around Sunday Brunch time. Overall the food was great! Fresh squeezed orange juice was so delicious.  Many more menu options then I was expecting. I had a gift card here and I would definitely go again for a date night.  Strawberry Cheesecake was heavenly!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax
Tristan S.,"Glendale, CA",384,1,,1.0,12/3/2017,"Ian (the manager) was extremely rude to us after we waited 40 minutes for 2 salads and refused to come the check.

Francis F.,"Herndon, VA",11,55,5,4.0,11/29/2017,"The Pina Coladas were unusually cold. And not just fun icee cold. An uncomfortable cold. Arctic cold.  I got brain freeze.  I also got esophagus freeze. Seriously, my esophagus froze up on me.  They may be made with liquid nitrogen. If you order a Pina Colada, ask them to pop it in the microwave first. Update: 11/30/2017 Cheesecake Factory - Thank you so much for your kind response. I was touched. It's truly rare for a business to reach out like that. Accordingly, I've increased your rating to 4 stars.  On a positive note, your Pina Coladas would be a perfect glimpse for someone thinking about cryogenics.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax
Jessica E.,"Franconia, VA",112,69,411,4.0,11/8/2017,"I loooove the Cheesecake Factory! It's always a treat going for lunch or dinner. The food selection is excellent - everyone will find something they like. The cheesecake selection is crazy. There's like 30+ cheesecakes to choose from and an additional dessert menu with even more choices. I really enjoy the decor and service, as well! This time, I went for lunch with some coworkers and it was packed. The waiting time was about 15 minutes and our food took a while to come out. The food itself was very tasty though. if you ever decide to order the burrito, keep in mind that it's HUGE. Our server was very friendly! I just find it kind of strange that with such a large food selection, there's absolutely no soup section. Just a soup of the day. Wish there were more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax
Jayne G.,"Chester, VA",31,87,208,4.0,11/17/2017,I have to be honest and say that I debated over giving a 3 star or a 4 star rating (If Yelp had 1/2 stars it would be a 3.5) 3 stars because of the wait. It was loooonnnnggggg. I expect that with a chain restaurant in a mall on a weekend. The problem is they should under promise and over deliver. I would rather be told it will be an hour and a half and get seated after an hour and 15 minutes then to be told an hour and a half and be seated after 2 hours. We were all getting crabby and tired of waiting towards the end there. 4 stars because to food. I have yet to have a bad meal at any Cheesecake factory and this one was no exception. The food was delicious and not just because we were starving ;) They have huge menu and everything is delicious. All four people in my party enjoyed their food. So good job Cheesecake factory - you are about so much more than cheesecake (in fact we were to full to have any!),https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax
Heidi L.,"Fairfax, VA",50,120,291,3.0,8/31/2017,"Definitely a great dessert place as well known for but okay food and not too bad service. My friend and I went there for a late dinner. We were seated almost right away. Our server's name was Chris. I think he must had a long day already. I felt bad but I still asked for what I would love to have. I did appreciate his best effort.  I dont want to say too much about this restaurant because they're pretty generic, food-wise and service-wise. Nothing really was too remarkable. You know what to expect when you go to any franchise restaurant.  I would go there possibly again but not probably within this year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax

Yijun W.,"Vienna, VA",0,3,,2.0,11/26/2017,"I have been to many other Cheesecake Facotory and I always love them, food-wise and service-wise. But I just ordered the worst sandwich I have ever had, a grilled turkey burger, in this place.  The meat tastes weird and the sweet potato fries are stale. Yes, I even made sure with the server that it is turkey. Honestly, right after I ate no more than half of the sandwich, my stomach started to feel bad. The service was not too bad at this location but my previous experience at other locations was much better. I understand that it's holiday season and our server must be very busy. But he didn't check with us once and not even asked if we need a To-Go box. For a moment I thought I was in a small diner. Good thing is my boyfriend likes his steak Diane.

Lash T.,"Fairfax, VA",34,6,,2.0,12/29/2017,"I understand that we were little late, they close at 12:30 and we arrived there around 11:20, we got worst service ever. I don't know what was the servers problem, he didn't want to stay on our table even while he was taking our order, may be we were not looking good, haha, jk. He was in rush all the time but there were no customers in the restaurant. Service was not attentive, they asked us if we needed any boxes to wrap our food while we were still having the food, that was disappointing. The food was delicious though, i loved their fish and pasta.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax
Kaitlyn H.,"Manassas, VA",126,11,2,4.0,8/9/2017,"I have always enjoyed The Cheesecake Factory but the service can be slow at times due to the number of tables that they have. The same thing goes for the food - it can take a while to receive your meal, or even just the bread for the table, since the place gets so busy. Overall, the food is delicious and I love the different items that the menu offers. You can't go wrong with any type of cheesecake, and they love to help you celebrate a birthday! The one major downside is the lack of organization with their pager system and getting a table. I had a meal planned with a group (10 people) at 7pm, and unfortunately, The Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations. I arrived 30 minutes early to get a pager, and still wasn't seated until 7:45 (over an hour wait!). This was on a week night, and I feel like an hour wait is unacceptable when they initially told us that it would be 20 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax
Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",387,338,279,4.0,1/25/2017,"Diverse menu is crowd pleasing, family friendly--Ahi carpaccio is awesome! 3.5 stars    I find Cheesecake Factory to be an excellent choice for a group with varied taste with adequate service.  The thick menu has something for every taste and the bar/wine list seems widely and well stocked. I am a bit of a food snob when it comes to tartare, but the ahi tuna carpaccio is fantastic! Each time I've sampled it here, the chef's knifework is perfect, slicing the buttery salty-sweet morsels into paperthin slices so that they melt in your mouth.  By far my favorite! I mix the thin wasabi sauce with a bit of cucumber (putting together a bit of each thing on the plate) with the delicate slivers of Sushi-grade Ahi and it all converges for a flavor explosion in my mouth! Amazing.  That dish alone is worth 4 stars.   The only reason I hold back on rating the establishment with 4 stars overall is  The small tables (2 tops) and the high ceilings which cause every clanking dish, kitchen noise, or raccous laughter from the bar to reverberate endlessly.  When portions are generous and plates are large, it can be crowded AND noisy-- not great for chatter with your date or mates.  Despite the visual aesthetics-- interesting fresco decor with mixed Egyptian motif and Greco-Roman style columns, the auditory atmosphere is that of a high school cafeteria making it a touch choice for date night and introverted friends may feel lost in the clamour.  Best for happy hour or with big families who feel comfortable yelling atop the roar to communicate.      The Thai chicken wraps are an amazing appetizer and great to share--just try to get a bigger table as the dish and its accoutrements are too large to Fit comfortably on the small two-tops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax
Gary S.,"Centreville, VA",0,9,3,2.0,12/6/2017,"We have had dinner here many times and is normally very good. Tonight I had the meatloaf and mashed potatoes and the meal was not as expected.

Majority of my experiences were good and I enjoy the diversity of the menu. However, it does get pretty crowded and they do not take reservations so keep that in mind when you're wanting to come on a weekend night.  I just want to point out one thing: they have a great happy hour special from 4-6PM. Drinks and small plates are all $5.95 so you should definitely take advantage of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax
Ryan R.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,136,140,1.0,6/12/2017,I came in to order a cake for a dinner party. Woman at the counter said cake is frozen should be a few minutes  Cake price total was $37.45  It was strawberry cheese cake. Monday night 6:40 pm  It was so disappointing. We waited 24 minutes for them to get the cake out of the freezer and handed it to us  I have been coming to Cheesecake Factory for over 15 years and it was always excellent service for dinner  But if I have to spend almost half hour in a weeknight to get a quick cake it is unacceptable  Should have gone to a proper bakery,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax
Jessica D.,"Springfield, VA",0,9,,1.0,1/6/2018,"RUDE AND INCONSIDERATE!!! I called this evening for potato soup and chicken samosas. After waiting 20 minutes my husband picked up our order. My husband returned with cream of chicken soup and chicken samosas. My husband called the restaurant to let them know, they gave us the wrong order. The young lady argued with my husband telling him, 1. It's clam chowder soup 2. I asked her what was the soup of the day (WHICH I DID NOT ASK, I already know) 3. They don't serve potato soup on Saturdays. (Which isn't true!!!) After going back and forth, the Manager gets on the phone and says, ""well we ran out of potato soup."" Unfortunately, this is the first time of us hearing they ran out of the soup when it's 9 degrees outside. We will NOT return to this Cheesecake Factory location EVER! I'm officially fed up.

Sarah K.,"Charlottesville, VA",501,115,104,3.0,5/16/2017,"I'd say this is a pretty standard Cheesecake Factory! Glamorous location, loud, crowded, and huge portions. If you want a great dessert or large portions or a nice place to bring a large party, this is it.  The food is overall pretty good and comes out in big, big plates. I have one friend who obsesses over their food and bread, but everything's just OK to me - no total standout flavors or anything. One time I came and ordered the margherita flatbread and it came out with a completely charred, inedible crust, so I sent that back and got another one ten minutes later. My friend also couldn't take out an ingredient from her avocado egg rolls because the waiter shared that a lot of items come pre-made.  All in all, I'd recommend as a nice dinner spot with a group! It gets loud for dinner, so it's not that intimate, but they handle bigger groups pretty well (in my experience).  Lastly, the cheesecake never ever disappoints. It's fun to come here just for dessert sometimes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax
Mariya K.,"Washington, DC",20,80,24,4.0,12/18/2017,"I don't know how many times I have been here for lunch or dinner. The location is pretty great when you work around that area. The wait can be exhausting but we managed every time :) You can sit at the bar if there is space, as well. Bread is good for before dinner. The drinks are ok, the meals are tasty. It's not that I would drive a long way to come here but I would enjoy coming back if at the mall or in the area for lunch. Some of the tables are positioned too close to other people, so it may be an awkward experience, feels like you are all one party. The cheese cake is one of the good ones. Love the lime.

Oak L.,"Burke, VA",0,30,,2.0,8/24/2017,"I normally have liked my experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  The food is good and portions are mostly large.  But, my son's family came back from overseas and we went out to celebrate and welcom them back.   My son complained to me that he was being bitten and swarmed by flying insects we initially thought were mosquitoes but turned out to be small gnats. that were flying and hanging about the window just above our table. Well, if I want fine dining, I don't expect to be annoyed by insects that come in swarms.  God only knows if any fell into our food.  (Yeah, I've had that experience and gotten sick in Mexico!)  But, this ain't Mexico and if this is the kind of environment you provide, you can say your farewells now, cause I know other restaurants around Fair Oaks that are cheaper and don't have insects hanging out above the table!!!    Yeah, I'm a little disgusted!  (And I didn't particularly like the feigned reaction of the person at the desk when I reported it on the way out.  She said she was going to take care of it right away -- so they admit they have a problem.   A more normal reaction would be surprise, as I was and a desire to verify the report.  Evidently, they must have heard of the gnats from others. )",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=40

Even though it's the end of the day, and everyone was tired and hungry, Cameron was super warm, nice, friendly and very attentive to our needs.

Ah F.,"Gainesville, VA",28,88,509,5.0,3/19/2017,It's one of few chain American food restaurants which is my all time favorite. Portion sizes are good . I visited this place to try their new appetizer and entrees they recently introduced. Crispy Korean cauliflower is must try . Thai and pineapple Chicken are decent as well.

Matthew S.,"Washington D.C., DC",15,177,49,4.0,8/8/2016,"This was my first time going to this location and it was perfect for our errand running. We went around 330/4pm so no wait and plenty of seating outside (in the shade) and it was the perfect weather for eating outside. My wife and I split the Tuna tar tar - WOW was that good. Fresh seared tuna with avocado and the most delicious sesame soy vinaigrette definitely rocked our socks. I ended up going with the filet medallions and my wife ordered the tuna tataki (tuna with salad). There were 4 little medallions on my plate, I should have ordered something more substantial because 8 bites of meat does not cut it when I'm hungry. I ended up eating some of Hope's tuna to try and fill me up.  We both had a bit room left in our stomachs so of course we had to order cheesecake. Our server Joshua recommended the new cheesecake that was just released (not even on the menu yet), the hazelnut crunch cheesecake, he said it was in his top 5 for cheesecakes...OK we're game. We ordered it and MAN was it rich...very filling and of course cheesecakey. I'm a fan of nutella, so the hazelnut and cheesecake is a win all around. I'd prefer less whipped cream (small dollop on top is fine but the plate seemed covered in whipped cream when it came).

Leena N.,"Springfield, VA",193,24,14,1.0,11/4/2017,"First time at a cheesecake factory and I must say that I had the worst experience. We were made to wait 2 hours after saying it was a 50 minute wait. My pager buzzed and the host said there was a mistake and that the buzzer died and gave us a new pager. We were told that we were the 4th party of 4 and would be seated within the next 10 minutes. This went on for a while. After waiting right next to the hostess stand for another 20 minutes watching parties go by we went to check our status. The hostess confronted us and told us that we were buzzed multiple times and were placed on hold. Her and the other hostess were rude and told us blantently that we were wrong. By all means I understand that the wait time for a resturant is something that cannot be controlled by the host stand but to be that rude is unacceptable. Retraining is highly advised. We asked to speak with the manager. The manager stated that he would make sure that our experience from mow on would be enjoyable and apologized. He also stated that for all the inconvenience he would comp dessert. The meal was less than enjoyable. The bread was cold. Our meals came out at off times. The tuna was rubbery and clearly left in the refrigerator for long periods of time. My bistro shrimp that was supposed to have crispy shrimp (as listed in the descripstion) was soggy and the spaghetti noodles were hard and no flavor. The waitress only checked in on us once at the start of our meal. We weren't even given a moment to try our food. At the end of the meal, even though we were promised dessert, they still charged us for it on our bill. It was definitely not communicated to our server which is also upsetting in itself. After speaking with our waitress, the manager that I had originally spoke to had left for the night without even checking in on our table. I will say that another manager did follow up with our table and did inquire about our night. He was also able to help us with our dessert dilemma. After a disastrous night like that I rather have a burger off the dollar menu at McDonalds. At least their food will be hot, tasty, with good customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=40

Asian, American, Mexican, Italian... check, check, check and check! I opted for an Asian chicken salad... it arrived in a bowl the size of a large pizza!  It's beautifully decorated and perhaps a little dark.  It's usually packed - probably because they literally have something for everyone. Service has always been nice as well.

Jesse C.,"Fairfax, VA",396,123,641,5.0,5/8/2016,"Great restaurant!!! Kinda hard to believe that this is my first time at Cheesecake factory.  I have always heard wonderful things about this chain, but never had an opportunity to try it till now. I would say everything I've heard was very accurate.  The food was SOOO GOOD!!! All the food is full of flavor and for the price you pay you get VERY hardy portions.  We got the summer rolls as well as the avocado egg rolls for an appetizers.  The summer rolls were ok.  They weren't spectacular, but they are very crunchy and pretty decent.  The avocado rolls were extraordinary!!!  Who knew putting avocado in an egg roll and frying it would be so tasty.  The sauce that came with it is like a sweet sauce that kind of reminds me of pico or salsa.  But I don't really know for certain, all I know is it was very tasty. For the entrees we got the Chicken Bellagio as well as the Chicken Madeira.  Both were extraordinary tasty!!!  The Chicken Bellagio is a pasta based entree with two large breaded chicken patties over a nice serving of noodles with a pesto and cream flavored sauce that was very delicious.  They top off the dish with some nice fresh arugula.  The dish was very delicious and everything worked well together and very filling.  The chicken madeira is no joke either, that dish is freakin amazing!!  You get three large chicken patties with mozzarella, sautéed mushrooms and asparagus on top, and they pour an absolutely mouthwateringly delicious dark sauce over the combination.  That combination of the savory meat and freshness of the veggies is an absolutely amazing explosion of flavors in your mouth.  The mashed potatoes were very delicious as well and on the chunkier consistency side.  This dish is a must have! We got two cheese cake for dessert: the mango key lime cheesecake and the reeses peanut butter chocolate cheesecake.  I prefer the reeses peanut butter chocolate cheesecake because I love chocolate and peanut butter.  They mango cheesecake was very delicious as well and very sweet.  I personally think that there is nothing in this world that is too sweet so I could take it.  Great restaurant and I promise you that I will be coming back.  There sandwiches sound really good so I need to make plans to come back and try some of those, and of course have me more of those cheesecake flavors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=40

We have been to the Cheesecake Factory at Tysons and had a terrible dining experience,... the waiter needed to be reminded to get our menu ,refill our water , and a whole lot more negative things ...and we were hesitant to go to the one at fairfax mall .  We had a 45 min wait at Tyson's location  and ended the evening on a bad note . But at the fairfax location Ash ( Ashim ) made our  hour long wait all worthwhile . Very pleasant , polite , patient and very personal with each one of us at our table ! You made us think of coming back again .. but yes ofcourse to the fairfax location :)  Thankyou Ash and Best wishes to you !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=40
My S.,"Burke, VA",108,193,350,4.0,5/30/2016,"Cheesecake is a solid place to go when you want some classic American food and you want to have a good time. The service is typically very stellar and everyone is friendly and efficient.  So, usually I get the same 2 things at Cheesecake but this time we tried something different! I also had a bite of everyone else's food too :) Grilled steak tacos - this comes with 4 mini tacos and a side of rice and beans. The rice is a bit bland and definitely needs some salt and pepper, but the beans were much more savory. The tacos overall surprised me as they had a good amount of both steak and guac on them. Solid 4/5 Crispy chicken sandwich - we got this Korean style which has a coleslaw and a Sriracha mayo on the side. Get this with the sweet potato fries because the sweetness compliments the sandwich well. The chicken is crispy and the brioche bun is soft and sweet. 5/5 Chicken and biscuits - this was my least favorite of all the dishes. It sort of tasted like a deconstructed chicken pot pie but the chicken had a slight overcooked, rubbery quality to it. The biscuit was not bad but nothing I would crave and get again. 2.5/5 Smokehouse burger - this was a solid burger, the bacon was crispy and the onion rings were a nice touch. We got fries as the side for this and they were fine. Burger could have used a *touch* more salt but it was fine. 3/5 Overall, you can always count on going to Cheesecake with a group of friends or your family because the menu is huge and there is really something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=40

A J.,"Centreville, VA",0,52,,1.0,7/6/2017,"I went here for my birthday to grab a nice meal and because I had a craving for spicy pasta. Big mistake. When my friend and I ordered our meals, we informed the waitress it was my birthday. She didn't acknowledge my birthday and replied with ""oh"". I asked her if on your birthday you got a free piece of cheesecake and she promptly said ""no"" but indicated she could talk to the supervisor (she never followed up on this). When the food arrived, I got the pasta and my friend got the burger and fries. My friend noticed that he had been eating meat wrapping paper that they had left on the burger while cooking it. Also not to mention, his fries were stale. When we informed the waitress she then told her supervisor. When the supervisor arrived he explained that they make the burgers daily and the paper was just the packing paper in between the burger. He acted as if it was no big deal that my friend had just eaten paper with his meal. The supervisor offered two free pieces of cake to us, but by this time we had lost our appetites and just wanted to leave. When the waitress came back we said we didn't want any cheesecake and just wanted the check. When the check came, we did notice that they took off the burger from the check. However, not once did the waitress or manager say Happy Birthday when my friend had indicated to them that we were there to celebrate it. Not to mention, when the waitress handed us the check she said that the manager ""recognized"" us from yesterday because we had a problem from the day before. Not knowing what she was talking about, we awkwardly told her it wasn't us, as that was our first time there. It felt like they were trying to accuse us of being troublesome costumers, which we did not appreciate. So after finishing our meal we both felt crappy and after this experience we will never come back on another birthday or ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=20

Our server was friendly and very accommodating with our requests (ie. swap out white rice for mashed potatoes, etc.). Majority of the time service tends to be on the slow side but even more so last night when we had a party of eight.

We emphasized each item on our order and, much to our dismay, the Cheesecake was not included in our to-go bag when we opened the bag up at our kitchen table. The error of the new waitress is not the issue writ large - it is the fact that there was a lack of training and oversight from the management at this franchise. I called the restaurant and explained the issue. Unsurprisingly, the manager was unhelpful and the lack of customer service did not rectify the situation. I highly suggest the Cheesecake Factory implement adequate training and hospitality to make their customers feel appreciated; this may be my last dinner experience there.  In summary not even a complimentary dessert to was offered on a next visit.  For your awareness, this was the Fair Oaks location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=20

Chelsea K.,"Winchester, VA",0,37,5,5.0,4/4/2017,"Absolutely wonderful service! My boyfriend and I stopped here yesterday evening for some food & beers after a day of shopping. Our server greeted us immediately and brought our drinks. After stuffing my face with bread & crab dip (which I would highly recommend) I realized I wasn't as hungry as I originally thought, but ordered a meal anyway.... Now, I'm one of ""those people"" who is better off just ordering chicken. ""How would you like your burger cooked?"" can only be answered by politely asking the chef to light it on fire and forget about it for an hour before bringing it to me. When our food came out 10 minutes later I knew it was a little too soon for my beef patty to have reached the level of burnt I was hoping for. It was still pink in the middle, and our server must've seen me making a face at it because he immediately took it back to the kitchen.  I was getting more full of bread and beer by the minute, so I really wasn't all that upset when he returned with a slightly-more-charred-yet-still-pink-in-the-middle burger. After all, that's how my dog likes it cooked! I wasn't going to say anything but our server could tell I still wasn't going to eat it, apologized, and brought me a piece of cheesecake (And trust me, the cheesecake did not go to waste).

On our last visit, we tried menu items we had never had before.  For our appetizer, we normally get avocado edge rolls, crab and artichoke dip or fried mac and cheese. This visit we tried the crispy crab wontons. They were pretty good. It was a big portion, so we opted to eat half of them and take the other half home. I normally order the Thai lettuce wraps as my entree. It is on the appetizer list, but the portion is so large, it is the perfect amount for an entree. I LOVE them! It is hard for me to order anything else. I decided to be brave and try the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. It was good. It wasn't as earth shattering as the Thai lettuce wraps, but it had a really nice flavor. My daughter ordered the avocado egg rolls as her entree. She loves them so much, she couldn't pass them up. Of course, we ordered cheesecake for dessert! There is no way I am trekking all the way out to Cheesecake Factory and not having a bite of cheesecake. If I am too full, I always take a slice home with me. I ordered the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake. It was so good! My daughter ordered the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake. She loved it!

It is in the ""Super Foods"" section rather than the Salad section of the menu which is a bit confusing. Although it seems like there are a lot of ingredients, I would say it was a pretty simple salad. It was definitely more like salad greens with dressing than an actual salad with toppings. Maybe it's because the toppings were mixed in well! When I got the salad, I was honestly a bit frightened because the guac looked old and dull (see pic). It was actually quite tasty though! I asked for no onions and the feta on the side and there was no fuss about this request! It was actually a hefty bit of salad. My mom ate maybe a quarter of it and I still had trouble finishing it all! So portion-wise, they are really not skimping out! I actually quite liked the dressing, but there could've been a little less of it. My mom thought the dressing was a bit spicy though so be careful if you are really sensitive! I couldn't taste any spices really, though. I was pleasantly full at the end of the meal. This was definitely not one of those salads that you get because you want to feel good about getting a salad but then it ends up being as heavy as an actual meal. No!

How is there only one table to seat our group. It was a large group but there are many options in the restaurant.

Mj L.,"Reston, VA",0,16,,3.0,9/5/2017,"This particular Cheesecake Factory has always been very consistent in a good way. There is a wide variety of food that is enjoyed by picky adults and toddlers alike. And of course the cheesecake is always good. Service at this location typically has been efficient and pleasant, and cognizant of families with small children. Based on previous visits, we took an elderly grandparent with us on Sunday, September 3, 2017 . However, that visit was awful in terms of service. It started out ok as we asked to be seated outside and were seated right away. The server took our orders and left. We ordered a kids meal for the toddler and opted to share a number of appetizers. An initial group of appetizers (including crab bites) came first. We finished those and then we waited... and waited... and waited. The server never checked on us and did not once refill our drinks. It took about an hour (seriously) for someone to bring us our other appetizers, which included sliders. The server dropped the food on our table and bolted away before we could ask for refills or even the check in anticipation of an antsy toddler. We had to get up and ask someone to provide us the bill because the server would not come around. Needless to say, we were embarrassed to have taken our elderly grandparent. The food was good but overshadowed by the awful service We had intended on ordering slices of cheesecake to share at the table, but the service took so long that we opted to leave. We quickly paid the bill with a gift card and attempted to purchase cheesecake at the front of the restaurant as we did not want to wait forever for the server to take the order and bring the dessert. This process also was delayed as we could not use the remaining balance on the gift card as the server failed to properly close out the bill. So... they had to track her down and get her to close out the bill so we could use the card. The pumpkin cheesecake, however, was very good; but we had to eat it at home instead of the restaurant due to lousy service. Bottom line is consistently good food but unpredictably service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=80

Tonight we had a chance to go out, and have only been to Cheesecake Factory once before together (this location as well). It was pretty packed when we got there, and it looked like the wait would be at least an hour. They told us it would be about 15 minutes, and they were spot on. Seating was a little too close together. This was my reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I'd rather not be able to hear the conversations of the guests at the tables on both sides of me, but I guess they have to seat as many people as they can to keep the wait times down. It was a little loud in there, but it was not unbearable. Our server was Veronica B. If I ever get the opportunity to dine here again, I hope she's still there. I used to wait tables (at a far smaller establishment) in my younger years. Veronica was probably the most attentive server I can remember in recent years of dining out - anywhere. Despite it being very busy, she was in point. She greeted us quickly, gave us a few minutes to look over the menu, came back after just the right amount of time had passed. Filled up drinks when she noticed they were getting low (not even low, like halfway). Didn't excessively check on us. Offered to box up our food when she saw we had both put our forks down. I can't say enough good things about her. I hope management gets to read this one. Food was great. I ordered the gumbo, my wife had the Romano chicken. Mine was hot, tasted fresh, very flavorful. Presentation was good. My wife said the Romano was good, came as was described on the menu, was juicy, went well with the pasta. Cheesecake Factory is know for their giant portions, and today was no exception. We shared a slice of the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for desert at home. Can anyone really complain about the cheesecake? It was fantastic as always.

As far as the fly in my drink, I work in an outdoor restaurant, I understand that shit happens. So it's not a big deal.

The service I received at this location during a weekday lunch was horrible. Quite possibly the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. We were seated and waited around 20 Minutes before being greeted. We finally had to ask another server if we could order. Eventually we were able to order waters, but they were rarely refilled throughout the meal. We also had to ask 3 times for bread to be brought to the table. We waited 45 min for our food before a manager came out saying that one of our meals had ""been dropped."" He didn't offer to do anything to ""fix"" the situation, other than saying it would be out soon. I believe they actually forgot to ring in the food because I've been to another CF location where the exact same story was told to someone at the table.  The server never came to talk to us about the ""dropped food"" nor did she ever apologize. Another server from another table actually came to check on us asking if our food had ever come out. He apologized to us despite not even being our server (I wish he had been). Eventually the food came out, but our server never checked to see if it was right. Eventually she came back to take our plates and we had to ask if we could order cheesecake. The ""dropped"" food was not comped or any cheesecake given for the trouble and the entire lunch took 2 hours and 12 min from the time we were seated- which is ridiculous when people have work.

Lynn F.,"Fairfax, VA",388,253,1769,1.0,4/12/2016,"I don't give out only 1 star to restaurants a lot, but honestly, I almost wish I could give it less.  So, we come in for a birthday party for one of my friend's good friend and since they don't take reservations, we had to wait for a table to open up. That wasn't a big deal, except for the fact that if we had 8 people in our group, the waiting time would have been 50 minutes, but with only 7, it was only a 15 minute wait. No offense, but that's kind of ridiculous. I have worked in the restaurant industry and a friend in the group had also worked in the restaurant industry and a difference of only one person in this context really shouldn't have made that much of a difference. I say this because, a) they could have moved two tables closer together, I see them do this all the time, or b) have all 8 people; 4 on each side of the bigger booths that they have in the back. They say this ""isn't allowed"" but I blatantly see this rule broken all the time so that was kind of annoying to deal with. Maybe there was some other reason, but to me, it seemed kind of like just an excuse but who knows.  Anyways, so one of the people in our party decided to leave because they didn't want to have to wait so long. This was unfortunate, but honestly, I almost wish I had just decided to skip as well. This however made the wait time shorter and we were able to sit much sooner than expected. Starting out, I thought it would be a good night! The server came very quick, got us all waters, and bread to start out with and I thought that it was going really well! He gave us a good amount of bread too! The problems only started to arise after we placed our food orders. I wanted to order the Shrimp Summer Rolls but they were out, so I opted for the Ahi Tartare. The other people in my party ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich, the Parmesan Chicken Sandwich, Medallion Steak (from the skinnylicious menu), the Stuffed Mushrooms and Dynamite Shrimp, someone else ordered the hibachi steak, and finally the 4-cheese Pasta. So, things are going fine, until we wait a good 35-45 minutes for the food. I would have been fine if our waiter had come by and checked on us or at least said something about the long wait, but he kept rushing by and didn't stop to say anything. This, I was not pleased with. I wanted to ask for more water because I had none but it was too hard to flag him down. Yes, being a waiter in the past I know it's very hard at times, but I saw that the waiters seem to all work together and with the bus boys and food runners. I feel like he could easily have asked them to at least refill our waters. It almost seemed like he was avoiding our table, but who knows. I will vouch for him and say that he was very busy!! They put a lot of people in his section and some of the other tables talked and had lots of comments and questions about the menu, so I understand that he was probably overwhelmed. So, when we finally got our food, one of our dishes never came. The Hibachi Steak was accidentally given to another table so one person had to sit and wait while we all ate. They did however take the Hibachi Steak off of our check because they had made a big mistake so that I really respect. It just kind of put a damper on our whole dining experience. For my meal, I was extremely disappointed. I got a 7.50 appetizer and it was tiny! I couldn't believe how small it was. I get that Cheesecake Factory is naturally way overpriced, but to this extent! Even if it had costed 5$ I would have called it skimpy. I was even further disappointed when I noticed that it was mostly just avocado. There was maybe a half of a centimeter of tuna, and the rest of the extremely small circular tartare was the avocado. I will say in its defense, it tasted pretty good. There really wasn't too much seasoning and honestly, if it were just larger, I think it would have been a perfectly fine appetizer, but it was just way too small for it to be even considered an appetizer. The other small plates that I tried from my friend were the Dynamite Shrimp and the Stuffed Mushrooms. Both were really small and their price came out to be 14.50$ (give or take a few cents). That was also ridiculous. Their size was larger though, but still, it was really steep. I will say though, I really liked the taste of the shrimp and the dipping sauce that came with it. The stuffed mushrooms were nothing special and I could have honestly made better ones.  Everyone else seemed to like their meals, but everything was just, okay. Nothing was amazing.  So, our waiter finally comes back after we have finished our meals and he asks if we want anything else and we say we just want the check and that we want it to be split by what each person ordered. He goes and gets it ready for us. This takes a VERY LONG TIME. When we finally get the checks, we return the bills and this takes a very long time as well. Let's just say, we were seated around 8, and finally got out around 10. I will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=80
Lauren M.,"Denver, CO",120,400,592,3.0,7/21/2014,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, meaning they specialize in cheesecake. It's famous for its cheesecake, don't order anything else. No one would go to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and ask him for garlic broccoli. So this particular factory, as many of you know, has an insanely large menu. So long in fact, I don't feel like reading anything else for the rest of the day. Their ridiculously long menu features fairly overpriced food stuffs that I'd say are pretty average in comparison to other chain restaurants from the handful of times I've been. So go for the cheesecake and coffee. That's all I can recommend. Their liquid items are pretty good too. I went here with my girl friend for a leisurely Sunday brunch. She ordered the California omelette, I ordered the lemon-ricotta pancakes and a double espresso, and we both ordered mimosas. She was happy with her omelette. My pancakes were only so-so. I thought the lemon/ricotta flavor would be stronger, but it was pretty mild. And there was the saddest, weakest pile of limp strawberries on top of the pancakes I've ever seen in my life (see photo). However, the mimosa I had included a nice strawberry on the flute rim. Not sure why they didn't use these strawberries on the pancakes. Lame!  The mimosa and espresso with a lemon twist were my favorite parts of the breakfast. So I encourage you to get a liquid while there. Our server also had a great sense of humor and was rather entertaining, so that helped, but it still only gets 3 stars for it's mediocre food.

My wife and I were eating here for lunch and noticed our table had not been wiped down. It was not big deal we waved down a staff member who was cleaning off tables and asked if he could wipe ours down. He was happy to oblige... with a completely dry towel. I don't know if Cheesecake factory missed the memo but you need to use some sort of liquid perhaps with some soap to actually clean surfaces. As off-putting as that was, it was the highlight of that visit. It's not often questions from your childhood are answered in front of your eyes.  We proceeded to order the enchiladas with flour tortillas instead of corn (yes, they will make this substitution if you ask). After 20-30 minutes we were brought lukewarm tortillas that had been sitting under a heat lamp for 10-15 minutes. If you tell me not to touch the plate because it will burn me, I want to be burned. After we told them our food was cold and we wanted them to remake it, they took it back, put it under the heat lamp for 15 minutes, and re-served it to us. If it was lukewarm after sitting under the heat lamp the first time, it's not going to magically get better being under the heat lamp again. We went to eat at elevation burger. The only reason I'm not giving Cheesecake factory a lower score is because I have had several good experiences at this restaurant. One thing I've noticed is most of the bad experiences occur during lunch time as opposed to dinner time. I don't know if it's just back luck but they seem to be more on point with dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=100
Lisa L.,"Arlington, VA",89,78,70,2.0,2/22/2016,"Boy oh Boy--well this was a bust. Decided to put a gift card I received from work into some use on Saturday night.  It was packed--as expected.  The wait for 2 people was 45 minutes.  I was fine with that.  The fiance and I camped out by the cheesecake area and watched them pack up all the dessert and such for a while.  The fiance notice that it has been pasted 45 minutes and told me to check on the status on our table.   When I approached the hostess table, 2 of the hostesses did not address me at all.  It was, I'm assuming, the front end manager, whom addressed me after standing there for a while.  I asked about the status of our table and the female hostess that ignored me said "" yeah we rang for your table."" Well the device didn't light up or vibrate (they gave me a faulty device).  There was no ""sorry for the inconvenience"", just a ""we'll ring you for the next available table""--....okay. Even the manager giggle a little and said ""yeah--they've been there the whole time."" T_T They did keep their word-- 2 minutes later, our device rang and they brought us to our table (btw-- your female hostess needs to learn some manner and if she hates her job, she should find another one at forever 21 or something).  Was seated and was greeted by Natalie.  She was a speedy server-- definitely got the job done by giving us what we wanted, quickly. She was polite but also didn't look like she liked her job.   Food:  Appetizer: The crab bites weren't worth it-- tasted like mushy.  Entrees:  Filet mignon with mash potatoes and green beans- The filet was tender, the beans were cooked just right (cooked thoroughly but still had its crunch) and was seasoned just right.  Tuna Tataki Salad: The salad had such great flavor with the wasabi vinaigrette.  The fish did taste a little fishy which made me a little hesitant however, if you put a little bit of everything (tuna, greens, avocado and some tomato) in one bite, you would enjoy the dish.  Service--sucked, food-- good but not worth overlooking the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=100

If it weren't for the bread and cheesecake this would actually be a guilt free healthy meal but of course there is and it cannot be passed up!  And like all CF meals, these both are more than ample portion and definitely enough to split.

Victoria L.,"Herndon, VA",491,535,912,4.0,1/7/2014,"Love the Cheesecake Factory chains. I use to go to the one at White Flint mall all the time and then they opened one at Tysons and Fair Oaks. Always a great experience at all these locations. Service is great, servers are attentive and provide awesome hospitality. The decor is modern, bright and very unqiue. Love the paintings on the cieling, the high cielings make it look very spacious. The menu is huge, almost like a telephone book, so choosing something can be hard. Also be aware that portions are huge, you'll have plenty to take home and leave stuffed! Some of my favorite items on the menu is -Crusted chicken romano which is a pasta dish with lightly crusted chicken with light tomato sauce -All burgers are fantastic - juicy and flavorful -Pasta carbonara- bacon in pasta? You have my appetite.  -Nachos- huge portion -Fried mac and cheese balls- I don't think I need to explain myself -Monte Cristo- served at brunch, it's not deep fried which doesn't make you feel guilty -Chicken maderia- mushroom maderia sauce, chicken covered in cheese served with a light and whipped mash potatoes  ALL cheesecakes are good..well I haven't tried them all but come on it's cheesecake! My favorite has to the white chocolate macadamia cheesecake and the chris outrageous cheesecake which is a coconut cheesecake (slight obsession with coconut).  A good tip is come on weeknights. Weekends can have a wait anywhere from 45-3 hours. Yes, I've waited 3 hours once. Luckily, it's at a mall so you can walk around, but don't come dying of hunger or you might as well go to Champps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=100
Kim B.,"Gainesville, VA",34,192,110,4.0,1/11/2016,"Sometimes you just have to eat at the Cheesecake Factory- and it's a great excuse to go when you have gift cards to burn there from the holidays.  We haven't been to a CF in years, mostly because we don't tend to eat at chains if we have a choice.  But, I've never had a horrible meal there and who doesn't like their cheesecake!?!!  So we waited 5 mins or so for our table to be sat, which isn't bad, and we were seated in the only quiet area of the restaurant, near the back.   We were greeted quickly by a female server, with short hair, who's name escapes me.  She was quick with us and not extremely personable.  She got our drinks for is and bread almost immediately.  Then she took our orders, and threw me for a loop when she said they were out of turkey for a Renee's special turkey sandwich.  So we ordered everyone else's and our appetizers while I perused the menu again. I decided On a chopped salad and she left.  Then, all of a sudden, we were greeted by the complete opposite of our original server, Jay.  He was friendly, warm and personable.  He immediately put napkins under our drinks because the original server had not, and said that it was shift change and he was taking over.  Talk about a 180!  He was awesome!  Jay was probably one of the most attentive servers we'd ever had in our lives and truly an asset to that company.   We got our food, which was delicious and hugely portioned as Cheesecake Factories tend to always be... Both of my girls wanted chicken fettuccine Alfredo, my husband ordered Chicken Bellagio and I had the chopped salad.  All was great and since we had the gift cards, we were going to get dessert and bring it home!  We told Jay that we wanted to walk around the mall a bit, then take our dessert to go- he suggested we order it now, they'd package it and all we'd have to do is stop by the front to pick it up from the cooler.  We ordered a few pieces, paid for it with our check and kept it by name in the front. 30 mins went by, we were ready to pick it up and I got back and the line was 15 + people deep.  I waited a while and it just wasn't moving.  This saved no time.  None.  After at least 10 mins, I asked two managers at the front desk if they'd be willing to grab by cakes from the cooler since I'd already paid for it.  They didn't seem pleased with the situation at all, and even after I gave them my name, and the exact flavors of cheesecake in the bag, they were still hesitant to give me my things.  They said that my server didn't follow standards, so I feel badly if Jay got in trouble, I don't think he should be.  I just didn't want to wait an hour on line for my freaking dessert.   P.S- the salted caramel, lemon raspberry creme cheese cake and the red velvet were all delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=100

We ordered beers, Cobb salad, and cheesesteak pepper sandwich of some sort.  The beers were the best part. The Cobb had a few slivers of thin chicken, but most of it was shredded lettuce that had seen better days. The only thing remotely good about this awful salad was periodically getting a tiny nugget of bacon.  My boyfriends sandwich looked great but he said it was terribly underwhelming.

I remember when Cheesecake Factory was very popular several years ago, but it seemed like the hype has calmed down a little bit. The bread basket was served prior to our entree, however we only ate the darker (brown) one as the other bread was too chewy and stale. Our server was a friendly older man. My cousin ordered a club sandwich, and I ordered the factory nachos as always. They were both delicious, but I'd say they're not too special compared to other restaurants that serve club sandwiches and nachos. Cheesecake Factory is known to serve great portions, hence the price, however I never taste anything extraordinary in comparison to other American restaurants.

The guacamole was loaded with flavor and the side peppers and spices were a nice touch. In fact, the guacamole was so filling that it would almost been enough for two, but the call of the Cheesecake Factory's Cuban sandwich was just too much to resist. The Cuban was quite a surprise and ranks as some of the best that I have ever had. With just the right amount of pickle and mustard, our sandwich was the perfect taste of Cuban flavor. The service was impeccable, and I would rate this at five stars; however, this Cheesecake Factory is located in a mall which unfortunately speaks of a restaurant chain experience....still, it is a yummy experience that merits a taste of Cuban goodness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=120

I love a restaurant that offers variety on their menu, but this menu is overwhelming - page after page of choices for entrees, appetizers and small bites. If you have a picky eater in your group, this is definitely the place to come. Perhaps it's because they offer so much variety in their regular menu, but I haven't found one thing that particularly stands out as being delicious. Everything is ok, sometimes a bit over-salted, but definitely not overly memorable (with the exception of that cheesecake). I do enjoy coming here for happy hour.

Today my friends took me to lunch for my birthday.  They were running late, so I was seated and waited.  After 15 minutes, my waiter Jesse finally came over to ask if I wanted water.  He didn't ask if I was waiting on anyone or if I wanted to wait and was quick to wander off. Soon after, one of my friends showed up and waited another 20 minutes for him to come back.  Finally when he did, she ordered water and waited yet again for it to be brought.  She had to ask him for bread, which is usually the first thing along with the water.  Eventually, after about 30 minutes he asked if we wanted to wait or order.  The food came out quickly enough, but it took an exceedingly long time for him to come back and check on us and we had to flag him down once or twice, so much so that a third person showed up and was there long enough to eat off of our plates while we waited.  We ordered dessert, which came fairly quickly because it is pre-made, but from start to finish it took us a shade under 2 HOURS to eat despite knowing what we wanted when we sat down. We were not ""those"" customers too distracted by our phones to look at the menu to take up his time.  We were actively chatting and waiting, so that is not the reason our service was so incredibly slow.  I know this place is regularly busy, but almost 2 hours for some salads, one entree, an appetizer, and some dessert?  I probably will not come back unless I am morally obligated by occasion or unless I know I will need to have time to kill to get waited on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=120

Angela W.,"Manassas, VA",92,79,108,4.0,7/21/2014,Been to this chain many times & for the most part never disappointed.   Large menu with great variety.  Not just another restaurant with the same old American and Italian food options.   People may come for the cheesecake but the food is really excellent.   Entree serving sizes are very large.   Down side is there is nearly always a wait & they do not take reservations or call ahead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=140
Jess C.,"Washington, DC",0,11,2,1.0,10/26/2015,Food was amazing as usual.  However the service was horrible. The server who brought our food out slammed the dishes on the table and left without saying anything. When we asked the same server for some napkins she threw the napkins on the table and walked away.  We've never gotten this kind of service before and  mentioned it to the manager as we were about to head out. She apologized and offered us a slice of cheesecake which was very nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=140
MA M.,"Fairfax, VA",3,21,,2.0,11/13/2016,"So I came here twice this week...yesterday and today. I returned because the selection was awesome, and the food tasted good. However the service leaves much to be desired. Yesterday the server missed a good tip because he never came to our table to check on us. Today the young lady dropped a crab cake as she brought the plate to the table then acted like she didn't want to replace it. Granted the tables are wiped down, everyone doesn't eat off of tables in public. After repeating myself she took the crab cake to the back and it looked like they immediately came back out with the same crab cake on another plate. This theory was almost proven when I asked the other server how the crab cakes are prepared. No way they could've prepared another one that fast. That slip was their fault. The next slip was mine but the server wasn't accommodating. As I was boxing up my daughter's meal, I dropped her meatball. I asked if it was possible to get another meatball and was told they take a long time to make and that the table should be clean. I'm sure they had a child- sized meatball available. Instead of making a big deal out of it, we cut the sides that touched the table.  The final straw was when we paid the check. My husband (the only man at the table) used his card. The server returned and asked if he was the one who paid the check. We didn't make a big deal, we decided we wouldn't be back, nor would we recommend this restaurant to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=140

Pot stickers - the sole reason I drank four glasses of that water with lemon Fried Zuchini - not what I expected and the batter tasted off Tuna Tartar - I only ordered this because I remember that it was the only thing I liked the last time I ventured here....yucky this time.... barely any tuna and low quality tuna at that.... way too much avocado and not enough of the sauce.  Horrible.

We literally went without reservation and with more than 10 people. Of course we had to wait since it was on a friday night and with no reservation. We didn't wait for long actually. They were really fast on preparing us a long table to fit all of us together. We waited for about 20 minutes and I was very happy with that. We sat down and the waiter came by right away and assisted us. We all told him that we came here for desserts and coffees. He was nicely introduce all their famous cheesecakes and his favorite one and which one to stay away. I was happy for his honesty since they didn't sugar coat on all their products. We all ordered one cheesecake and some people ordered coffee and it came out pretty quick. He was able to accommodated all of us without frustration because we know we in a big party.  The only thing I didn't like it because they didn't have several cheesecake that I wanted. I went for option 1, they said they ran out then I went to option B (also went out) I didn't have a choice but went with his recommendation.

And I like to try them at any place that has them on the menu. Unfortunately Cheesecake Factory, Fair Oaks falls short when it comes to fish tacos.  My tortilla was definitely not fresh, the grilled fish was dry and lacked flavor.  My friend got the tempura fish and said it was equally unremarkable.  The cabbage on the tacos was bland.  Meh!  Super disappointing.  I had to soak my tacos in hot sauce to give them a kick.  Perhaps it's the fact that they have about 500 different food items on the menu but food isn't actually their specialty... It's cheesecake.  And I can say that their cheesecake is banging!  I shared the Khalkha cheesecake with a friend and it was amazing!  Rich, creamy... Awesome crust. Their cheesecake never fails me...

We were seated in the bar area and the hostess pointed at our table at the far end of the bar and waved us forward. I thought it was odd that she didn't walk us to the table. A server came by and took our drink orders after a bit of a wait, but it turns out he wasn't our main server for the meal. We found that out after asking if someone was going to take our food order after the drinks arrived.  Another five minutes or so later and our assigned server swung by to take our orders and bring bread. The bread was totally smashed where it had been cut in half. I thought it was very strange that the kitchen couldn't manage to cut the bread without smashing it flat. Anyway, besides the smashed bread the rest of the food was very good. The last snafu came after we finished eating and had told the server we didn't care for any dessert or anything else beyond the checks. It was a fairly long time between that and when the checks actually got to our table.

It was disgusting. The breaded fried parmesan chicken was still delectable, but unfortunately, the Cheesecake Factory has RUINED MY BELOVED LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA...the ONLY really good food item they had going for them...WHYYYY!!!??!?!

Jon D.,"Fairfax, VA",0,3,,1.0,9/3/2016,"Not a long wait and decent drinks and cocktails. However, that's where the good experience ends. Server was polite but had very little knowledge about their menu items. Generous serving sizes, but the fact is its just waste. They load a plate with grain or pasta and a little meat. So let's get to problems other then portion control. Chicken Marsala was unrecognizable and tasted like buttered noodles with mushrooms and a drop of red wine vinegar as opposed to Marsala wine. Personally it tasted like bland garbage. 18$ worth of garbage. The bang bang shrimp and chicken $19.99 had a few pieces of shrimp and a full quart of rice that tasted two days old in the middle of the plate. I ordered a kids Mac and cheese for my 6 yr old son and when it came he said dad it's disgusting. I tasted it and it was an old soggy noodle with butter no cheese and I'm absolutely sure not even a pinch of salt was added. At this point I informed the server that this was unacceptable he sent over the manager who gave a half assed we're sorry. I asked does anyone even bother to taste the food you serve before it leaves the kitchen to which she responded no. I asked how does anyone including what you claim is a chef know what he is serving daily to customers if nobody even tastes the food. They looked confused. So what your saying is nobody tastes the food that you prepare before it leaves the kitchen and not only is your staff unknowledgeable about the food but there is no quality check to ensure food is made properly. They offered to comp it but that's not my problem. I stated from one chef to another please tell your chef to do his job. I'm pretty sure the sauté cook prepared both the mac n cheese as well as the Marsala. So essentially getting food out of the kitchen is more important then sending edible food for the price. Portion control is ridiculous, quality is below poor and a restaurant that has a staff that is unknowledgeable is unacceptable. I asked the manager and chef to try the food they had just passed off on to me and my family as i stated I wouldn't serve this to a dead person let alone a paying customer. They came back and agreed it was terrible. So that's my point the professionals of your kitchen are okay with allowing garbage to come out of the kitchen and nobody ever thought of actually tasting or ensuring quality control. The plate up looked like a truck stop so apparently the standards of this kitchen are low!! Now that being said I dropped it and paid my bill went home and had to prepare dinner for my son. All around avoid this Cheesecake Factory, it's about quantity without a single effort of quality I'd am surprised they claim they have a chef maybe he never heard of Marsala wine, salt and cheese.  Avoid if you can or unless they get their act together.

Unfortunately, the details were ALL THE WAY AT THE BOTTOM of the site under a string of several pictures, VERY distant from the promotional headlines.

While the dynamite shrimp is excellent - there are often times when we must send it back because the shrimp is full of veins, sand and innards. We give it a try every time (because it truly is good when done correctly), but we are often disappointed.  The other entrees are standard but honestly, you could get the same at Olive Garden for five bucks cheaper.  The only entree I was mildly impressed with was their steak.

I love the two breads in the basket served to each table. In general, the food tastes just fine. It's nothing really unique, and the menu is giant so it's hard to tell what's the specialty, but it's a-ok. Weeknights, they offer lots of $5 happy hour specials until 6 p.m. -- spinach and artichoke dip, guac and chips, nachos, chicken potstickers, sliders, etc. These special are only available in the bar area, so ask to sit there if you want to take advantage. Kids meals are a bit on the pricey side ($6.95 for a cheese quesadilla with no sides), but a drink is included.

Tim H.,"Silver Spring, MD",28,115,6,3.0,4/23/2014,"CF executes perfectly, of course -- it is what it is without fail:  very tasty yet very rich food for the high-end chain crowd.  The restaurants are very nice and the service is right on par for the price.  Really, it's a low-risk choice, especially for groups with varied preferences as the menu is massive.  This location is no exception. But the introduction of calorie counts on CF menus was suicide.  You can easily spend all of your 2,000 daily calories on lunch at CF without batting an eye.  Some individual items are by themselves over the 2k calorie mark. This is not including dessert, which obviously is a prominent selling point for them. They make some effort to provide alternatives, but their clear strengths are the most metabolically expensive choices. That said, eating is an optimization problem with at least five variables:  price, taste, ease, health, and environment.  CF is a unique combination of these features, and the fact that they are miserable in one of those factors can be made up if you really value what they do for you in others.  I personally don't often value such intensive inputs, but as with anything, use it when it makes sense.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=180

I told the waitress i was not happy, so she offered to remake the dish again without the breaded shrimp. The new dish came in a complete different sauce, and the mushroom was missing. Shrimp came without the breading, which is fine, but it tasted like rubber, worse than before. I couldn't bare eating the shrimp at all.  Then came the dessert. I ordered the mango cheesecake...omg...SO SWEET like i am going diabetic. I took one bite and i couldn't finish it, just like the pasta. I felt so sick after eating their food.

Ray W.,"Fairfax, VA",0,1,,1.0,4/28/2016,"I'm not one to complain or even write a negative review, but I was highly disappointed with my service at the Cheesecake Factory tonight. I work in a restaurant, so I understand the struggle of juggling multiple tables and maintaining great service. However, the restaurant was slow  and my server only had one other table, so my service tonight was unacceptable. For the first time in months my boyfriend and I had a night off together from work and school. We decided on the Cheesecake Factory as our date destination. Two minutes after we sat down, our server greeted us and we ordered our drinks. Probably five minutes later she returned with our drinks and we ordered our appetizer and entree at the same time. The appetizer took well over fifteen minutes to come out. Our neighbors had ordered four different appetizers; their appetizers came out within seven minutes. And while the crab and artichoke dip was really good, I didn't quite understand why it took so long. The server didn't apologize for the delay or even bother to tell us it would be a few more minutes. Both my boyfriend and I had finished our drinks and not once did our server stop by to refill them. Our entrees took over twenty minutes to arrive at our table. Finally after our entrees made it to our table, our server noticed our drinks were low. So that was about twenty minutes or so without a drink? Again, our server was missing for another twenty minutes and we awkwardly sat waiting for her to return so we could order dessert. For dessert we ordered strawberry shortcake and Oreo cheesecake. Again, took entirely too long to arrive at our table. After placing our dessert in front of us, the server brought us our check. My boyfriend signed the check and she scurried off with it. The strawberry shortcake looked delicious and was a huge portion.. Just what I needed! However, the shortcake was dry and hard and halfway through my ice cream, I found a chunk of glass in my dessert. Our server didn't stop by to check to see if we needed a box or how we were enjoying it, but instead began on her side work. I probably saw the server a total of four times and when I did, she seemed rushed and annoyed.  The food was good per usual, but ultimately, I am really disappointed with the lack of hospitality of the server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=200

I do love the tuna tartar and the seared tuna salad but have I mentioned the free bread? I have been known to come here late at night to just get coffee, cheesecake, and bread.  It is the motivation I need to go to the gym the next morning.  In the evening it is much quieter and if you sit at the bar it is a lot more intimate and you can run into some interesting characters.  I have even been known to share my bread with strangers, something my mom told me to never do...  If you're lucky you'll see me there and share a loaf of bread with me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=220

However, I have been to the Cheesecake factory many many times and each time, service is quick and very attentive. Although I normally do not order the food from here b/c the fatty I am go straight for the dessert, I've noticed that for the price, you get delicious yummy food in large portions (1 entree can be shared among 2 people).  I had the drinks here for the first time today and they are definitely worth the price! My friend ordered a pomegranate margarita ($10) and I ordered the pomegranate mojito ($10.75). Not only was the drink strong (but not overwhelming that all you taste is the tequila) but it was also very tasty! It's not overly drenched in juice nor is it overtaken by alcohol but had the perfect combination of both! The drinks were served in large glasses b/c I noticed normally at other large chain restaurants like Coastal Flatts or Sweetwater, the drinks are literally HALF the size of the ones served at Cheesecake Factory for the same if not more expensive prices.

Susan H.,"Reston, VA",452,634,1111,3.0,2/4/2010,"I remember when the Cheesecake Factory first came to be.  Before it was even in this area, it was in Las Vegas---in the Caesar's Palace Shopping Mall to be exact.  The hype was really something.  Everybody raved about it.  When we first spotted it in Las Vegas, there was a long line waiting to get in and this was during an off-peak time.  So...when it hit this area at Tysons II, we went and thought ""What's all the fuss about?""  In other words, it didn't live up to the hype.    Well...since then we've been to the Sterling location, and now, tonight, this one at Fair Oaks. Actually, tonight was the best experience we've had with the place.  The food was far better than it had been at the other locations.  This leaves me wondering if this is only in this location or is it chain-wide...? I find the menu choices to be overwhelming.  Our server told us that there are 200 different items on the menu!   Finally, I decided to try Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna.  Before ordering, I asked the server just how spicy this dish was.  She said she gave it an 8 out of 10 with 10 being the spiciest.  Ok...I'll take my chances!  Well...it turned out to be very tame.  Yes, there was wasabi flavoring but it only faintly registered.  The menu said that the meal included rice, julienned vegetables and a ""miso sauce"".  The sauce was white (I'm assuming it was supposed to be white miso) but didn't have a miso flavor.  The julienned veggies were a mix of carrots, green beans and a couple of edamame beans.  The tuna was served rare on the inside and just seared on the outside.  Disappointingly, it came out lukewarm.  The tuna quality wasn't as good as Legal Seafoods but still it was decent. My husband ordered the Salisbury Steak dinner which came with a mushroom gravy, homemade redskin mashed potatoes, and green beans.  He was pleasantly surprised with the dish.  He thought it was better than the average Cheesecake Factory fare. We were full so we got a piece of Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake to go.  It had a brownie crust with Kahlua flavored cheesecake, topped with chocolate mousse and chocolate ganache.  It was tasty but very rich so we were glad we only got one piece to share!

Meaghan O.,"Washington, DC",3,25,3,1.0,12/27/2013,"I used to be one of the biggest fans of this restaurant, EVER. But sadly, that is no longer the case.  To start, the service at this restaurant is terrible. The last time I ate here (and I didn't even really get a chance to eat) it took us 20 minutes to get ASKED what we would like our drinks to be. Really, dude? I could have asked for a water cup from the BK at the other end, gotten water, and been back in my seat before you even asked what I would like to drink. Strike number one. Strike number two would be the fact that I never really knew who our server was until the last 15 minutes of our meal. And that was AFTER the last straw and I spoke with the management. Strike number three would be when I found hair in my food. Not just one hair, but a little tuft if you will. Of course this was after I already started eating (delightful). After waiting 20 minutes to get someone's attention, I finally got so annoyed I asked to speak to a manager. Either it was his first day, or he needs to find a new calling. At first, he only wanted to have my plate re made at no charge. How sweet, but remind me why I would trust your chef to cook my dinner again? When they can't even handle food safely to begin with? NO THANK YOU SIR. I basically had to push him to have my plate covered at their expense. If this would have happened anywhere else (it could have been a fast food chain for all I care) this would not have happened. I'm pretty sure the whole tab would've been covered, with a few freebies. But I can't ever recall finding a tuft of hair in my food before, so I digress...  I wasn't expecting a lot after that disappointment, but I definitely was not expecting that type of ""resolution"". If it was up to me, this place would receive no stars.

We were seated and I already knew what I wanted, as I studied the menu online from the night before. The spicy ahi tempura roll was delicioso! Wasn't as spicy as expected, but it had great flavor. The bf got the buffalo wings as expected, and they were huge. I can't say much about the taste considering I was stuffing my face with my appetizer. The entrees came as soon as I was done with my roll and he was maybe 2 wings from being done. For it being packed, we were surprised at how fast it came.

Noah K.,"Vienna, VA",0,10,2,3.0,4/8/2013,"Cheesecake Factory, an interesting place to go to that seems casual and a little bit classy at once.  Usually busy on the nights that I have gone with friends.  Wait times can be a little long depending on how many people you come with.  My friends and I came here about once every two weeks for an entire semester so I think I have a decent feel about the place.   The service has been great every time we have gone.  Drinks do not take long to arrive, and the waiter or waitress has always been vigilant on the needs of not just us, but those around us.  A usually friendly bunch.  They were amused when me and a friend started singing the songs playing on the overhead speakers.  Food and drink, pricey, very large selection, and in large quantities.  That's the thing that I have found consistent in my experience.  The food isn't the most top notch thing I've ever had, but it's certainly good.  And they certainly serve quite a lot of it.  There are some foods though I would avoid, such as the fish tacos.  While not a fan of fish in general, this sort of thing was not very pleasant to taste.  I, personally, go for the burgers most of the time.   Typical drink selection, alcohol or not, nothing too special to say here.  A few drinks stand out.  Need to pay for refills, full price if I recall correctly.   Only thing I wonder about in the times we have gone is where does our waiter/waitress go when we want to pay.  Many times, they seem to be right on top with checking on us, asking about food or drinks, and then suddenly drop off the radar once they drop off the checks.   I would like to go again sometime soon and see if my experience would be any different from the past ones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=260

P B.,"Alexandria, VA",0,23,2,1.0,1/1/2014,"This review is specific to this location and manager. We were a party of 4 adults and 5 kids (ages 4-10). Four people in our party were there when our name was called. The manager, Ricky, said we would need to have a majority of our party present to be seated. We said the rest of our party were parking their car and would be there in a couple of minutes. Ricky decided to give our table to another party and told us that we would get the next table available.  50 minutes later he was still unable to seat us and gave the next large table to another party.  He was clearly an inexperienced manager who was overwhelmed and did not know how to manage the situation.  His tone became disrespectful and somewhat aggressive when we periodically inquired and registered our frustration.  Ultimately our kids could no longer wait and we decided to go elsewhere.  At our request, Ricky gave both of our families $50 gift cards. That is the one positive thing from the night's experience.  But we would rather have just been seated when it was our turn. We love the food at Cheesecake Factory and will certainly be back.

Linda C.,"Centreville, VA",135,238,184,4.0,2/21/2011,"So who doesn't like cheesecake?  Cheesecake, of course, is the main event here - but there's so much more to like.  First off, the atmosphere and decor are amazing.  The ceilings are painted in soft watercolors, sort of a Trompe l'oeil thing going on.  The lighting and the artifacts (think marble columns, Greek statuary, Egyptian vases) create this heavenly atmosphere - even the entryway makes you think of a cross between the home of some Roman god and Caesar's Palace in Vegas.  One of the things I DON'T like about the dining room is that the tables are set very close together.  The servers have a hard time setting down dishes and working around the small space between tables.  But I attribute that to the popularity of Cheesecake Factory; sometimes the waits are very long, and if they had less tables squeezed into the dining room, waits would be even longer. On to the menu.  The menu is about 20 pages long.  No kidding.  It is a hardcover novel, with every other page an advertisement for a local establishment.  Today I saw an ad for a jewelry store, something called ""Girlfriends Meet Up,"" and fur coats.  I suppose these are sponsors of some kind, I don't know.  The menu goes on and on and on - it takes about 10 minutes to read everything, but their selection is incredible.  Everything from Shepherd's Pie to Vietnamese Caramel Chicken is listed.  I sometimes wonder how their chefs can create so many varied dishes and have them all be good.   For lunch today, I ordered off the specials menu.  The ""specials menu"" has been in circulation for at least a few months now, but the choices are pretty good.  I had an excellent salad called Carlton Salad, which consisted of roast chicken, raisins, cranberries, pears, feta cheese, chopped walnuts, all tossed in a light vinaigrette.  I hope they put this salad on their regular menu - it's too good to lose!  Other dishes I've tried have been the Chinese Chicken Salad (excellent, except too many puffy rice noodles stacked on top for decoration), Cobb Salad (also excellent), and Chicken Bellagio (on the current specials menu as well - terrific and another dish they should serve permanently).  Service was great - I've never had a problem with service here.  And, naturally, the cheesecakes.  I enjoyed sharing the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake, made with a light lemon mousse and raspberry sauce.  Delish!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=260
D K.,"Fairfax, VA",1,6,,3.0,8/3/2010,"Went here tonight with my friend after hearing about this place for years and giving into curiosity.  In actuality, I felt that it was more of a 2.5'ish, but I suppose the cheesecake helped a little.  The atmosphere was a bit dark, but I don't mind that at all since it provides a feeling of privacy as opposed to brighter places.  There were at least five different birthdays being celebrated during my visit, though how many of them were actual birthdays I'm not too sure about.  Service was decent enough, our waitress was attentive and polite and our drinks were refilled consistently.   I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta while my friend had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta.  It was quite clear who had made the better choice in ordering based on intuition, and it surely wasn't me.  My pasta just didn't taste like anything special; it seems like you'd be able to find it in any other hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  Eating it seemed like a chore after about five bites, but I persevered nonetheless.  The portions are quite hearty, but I wasn't feeling that way at the time given how I didn't want to eat much more of my meal.  The Louisiana Chicken Pasta was quite tasty, however. After finishing half of our dishes, we decided that it was enough and ordered dessert.  Naturally, we ordered the cheesecake, the main reason why anyone goes to this restaurant to begin with.  I had the Chocolate-Chip Cookie Dough while my friend had the White Chocolate Caramel Macademia Nut.  The cheesecake was pretty good as expected and the slice was a bit larger than I had imagined it to be.  If you're planning to finish dessert, don't try to finish your entree beforehand.   In summation, while I certainly didn't like what I had ordered, I would come back again and try something more tried and true on their largely extensive menu.  I would recommend Cheesecake Factory as long as you order something people have already tried and liked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=260

This is my favorite place to go in the summer when I just want salad for a light meal, and the outdoor seating is nice, too. Again, the portions are huge. Ingredients are perfectly fresh, presentation is beautiful, and the flavor so satisfying that you could almost forget you're eating a salad. Highly recommend the Asian chicken salad. And, of course, there's the cheesecake. I don't often have room leftover to eat a slice, but you can always get one to go. Their chocolate-chip cookie dough cheesecake is out of this world. I don't think I've ever before used the phrase ""out of this world,"" but it applies here. In the best possible way.

Molly T.,"Northern, VA",88,69,13,4.0,1/14/2010,"Yay! I'm a Fan. Solid 4 stars. I found out about Cheesecake Factory a couple years ago and it's become a staple for good eats on the cheap. The portions are HUGE(HUGE!!) and the service is always good. The baked bread that is complimentary is delicious and their water is surprisingly refreshing(more so than other restaurants in the area).  -The Factory Nachos are HUGE and delicious. The sour cream, guacamole and tomato salsa are always fresh and they'll bring you more by request for free. We usually get it on the side, since it's HUGE and that way you can take extras home, which we do. They're good a day or two later as well(Warm/ Bake in oven). - The Buffalo Blasts are crispy on the outside with moist, spicy chicken on the inside. Their blue cheese dressing is fresh and better tasting than basically any other blue cheese I've ever had. Their ranch is good, too. My Mom and I typically share the lunch special: pizza and a Caesar salad for $10.95. It's enough for two and we usually take some home. My boyfriend usually gets his own meal and this kid can eat, but he still has leftovers. Try sharing-- save money and your fridge from overload. Another favorite is the Renee Special with chicken salad. The chicken salad is amazing- pine nuts, celery, chicken, some kind of good sauce(maybe just mayo, but it's yummy) on a buttered focaccia-like bread. It's also good leftover. The lunch special comes with soup and salad. I've been very pleased with the soups particularly the creamy chicken(which surprisingly had fresh vegetables that were healthy, but not overpowering) and the broccoli and cheese. The deserts are incredible, but some of the best are not totally cheesecake related. The lemoncello( soft cake, lemon and cheesecake with strawberries) and the Chris's Outrageous (Chocolate mouse, cheesecake and german chocolate layered) are some favorites. If you want cheesecake, the apple with caramel is good as is the chocolate chip cookie dough. The strawberry creamsicle drink ( alcoholoic) is a highlight from the bar. I remember the Fruit Punch( Tornado or something?) being a light, fruity and delicious drink as well. I've never met a meal, drink or desert here that I didn't like.

Bad for me, yes, but wonderful nonetheless. The actual FOOD sometimes just seems so... meh. I don't go here often, but every time I do, I can't help but wonder if they try to make up for the ""bleh"" taste of the food by piling on heaping portions. If it doesn't taste good, I don't want three times as much! The chicken tacos were a mistake: giant family-sized platter with way too much food on it, and not very good food at that. I probably should have known that from reading the menu; any place that serves pizza, pasta, burgers, ""Asian"" food, AND ""Mexican"" food just screams, ""DON'T EAT THISSSSS!"" I don't have kids, but I did notice that they didn't seem to have a childrens' menu. Maybe I'm wrong, but that teeny tiny three-year-old at the table next to me was working on a gigantic bowl of pasta by herself, and something about that just didn't seem right. If you have kids, you might want to think again. I will say, though, that their service is always top-notch. All the servers are really friendly and informative, and I feel like the service is pretty fast, too. Their breakfast/brunch on the weekends is actually much more affordable than other places in the area (I had a GIGANTIC platter of pancakes, eggs, and bacon for about $7 -- less than what I'd pay at the Silver Diner down the street), and the portions (as usual) were huge.

The service was pretty good; our waiter was very attentive and on the ball.  He came quickly for our drink orders and returned each time for the next phase of the whole dining operation at appropriate intervals.  Our orders came quite quickly considering how busy the place was.  The food had the typical Cheesecake Factory taste.  Fairly good.  I love the heaping glob of mashed taters you get with the meals... and the portion sizes are always ginormous. And of course... my now favorite part of the meal is the Red Velvet Cheesecake... O. M. G. !!!  Seriously... this thing will seriously make you have a moment.  Now I'm a huge red velvet fan period, so maybe I'm biased a bit... a tad... a smidge.  But this cheesecake is friggin incredible.  Just drop it in front of me and leave me alone as I drift to my happy place for about 10 minutes.  Sooooo good!!!

Kevin G.,"Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain",34,27,,2.0,8/19/2010,"I personally hate their food. And it super, super bad for you as they use cheap cooking oils. Some of their entrees are upwards of 2500 calories and 70g of saturated fat (e.g. Bistro Shrimp Pasta). I went there with my parents while they were in town visiting. The menu is extensive but I couldn't help feeling like despite the multitude of options, nothing really caught my eye. Everything just seemed kinda... eh. I got a combo platter and it was eh. Not all that exciting or interesting. As for dessert, the cheesecake wasn't all that exciting either. Definitely looked better than it tasted. My parents felt the same way about their meals. The high ceiling tends to make the sound of the restaurant reverberate a little bit, so it's not exactly an intimate setting.

Jackie E.,"Bothell, WA",0,24,,3.0,1/4/2012,"2.5 stars My brother recently came for a visit from Alaska. There isn't a Cheesecake Factory in Alaska, so he wanted to come here for his last meal. Odd, yes. But it really can't be helped. The boy is a product of America and enjoys chain restaurants and substandard food. Oh, well. I ordered the Blue Cheese BLT Burger. They cooked it to my specifications (medium) and the toppings made it deliciously salty, smoky, and pungent. Yeah, I know pungent isn't a very good descriptive word, but it's bleu cheese...if it's not pungent it probably doesn't taste very good. I also ordered the side salad in place of French fries because I'm about sick of French fries. It was a large salad and came standard with balsamic vinaigrette. The top portion of the salad was pretty good. It was nicely coated with dressing. The bottom portion, however, was drenched in dressing! I couldn't finish it because the overabundance of dressing caused the whole salad to be overwhelmingly tart. I supposed I should have tossed the salad myself before eating? I'd definitely recommend to others that you order your dressing on the side. My brother ordered the Wild Mushroom. He did not enjoy it whatsoever. I kind of felt bad because he had specifically requested the Cheesecake Factory. I didn't try his, as I was consumed with the massive amounts of food on my own plate, but I definitely take his word for it. My family loves them some mushroom burgers. As we had eaten much too much, we had no room for dessert. Didn't matter much to me...I don't like cheesecake. My brother, however, ordered cheesecake to go. He wanted the Oreo cheesecake, but they were out. I know it's the weekend, but that seems like an odd cheesecake to run out of so early in the evening (it was around 6:00PM when we left).

Somehow, the food came out all around the same time, which was unfortunate becaue theplates wereso big we really hardly had room left on the table. The plates here are HUGE, but that is only to hold the MASSIVE amounts of food that they give you. I'd complain about the prices- but really, with the amount of food that they give you, it makes sense. Don't know about the salad, but the nachos were decent. Would have been better if the cheese and other toppings were distributed a little more evenly. Crab cake was pretty good. Had way too much food, though.

Mitch R.,"Vienna, VA",80,258,132,4.0,5/8/2009,"Going to Cheesecake Factory (CF) has become a huge affair.  It seems that no matter when you get there, there will be a 30+ minute wait for a large party or even for two. Once you are seated you will be greeted by someone who is likely younger than you and doesn't really know how to wait tables. After you finish digesting the menu which might as well be a novel you will still be unsure of your decision because there are just too many choices. Whatever.  I have found my two staple dishes at CF. The Pasta Davinci and the Shrimp BLT. Both are fantastic and very filling. If you have never eaten at CF, their portions are comically large, so much so when I took my family there who is from Germany they said no wonder why Americans are so fat.  I tried their Cajun Jambalaya because I love Jambalaya. This was not Jambalaya, it was offensive.. This was pasta, with olive oil and simple dried Cajun seasoning mixed in. It was absolutely horrid. I think it was made wrong but the waitress (who was essentially a dumb highschooler) said that is how it is made.  Desserts at CF. Three words. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. My lord. It is the most delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth, it is so good that I get slightly aroused while consuming this delightful chocolate goodness. If you like chocolate, and don't try this, then shame on you.  This place should honestly be a 3 1/2 rating but the cheesecake saves it from a solid 3 stars.

The way management handles their mistakes also leaves a lot to be desired.  For example, the last time curbside made a mistake, the manager basically accused us of actually having the missing items.  Unless this constitutes acceptable behavior, their team needs some brushing up in the customer service department.

Valencia W.,"Annandale, VA",102,782,8,3.0,12/30/2010,"I decided I wanted to eat at the Cheesecake Factory because I had been sick for the past few days and wanted to start off eating ""real"" food at the Cheesecake factory with Gift Card's I had received.  I've been going to the Factory both here and at Friendship Heights for years so I'm finally getting around to reviewing our experiences at this location.  For some reason the night we decided to go was when the rest of Virginia decided to go as well.  The wait was an hour and we realized this isn't a bad thing as it is inside Fair Oaks Mall.  The bad thing is that this means with an hour at the mall--I'll probably come back with at least one bag and I did.  Once we were seated I noticed I had to step over some food on the floor.  It was dirty and yes, there were kids all over the place but still, the amount of food on floor was ridiculous and there were napkins as well.  One of a few things need to be done--parent's watch after your kids, I mean kids and be kids but keep that food on the table.  The other thing that can be done is for the restaurant to sweep it up.  Now, once we sat down our server was very prompt--too prompt I'll have to say and was rushing us.  My fiance had just got back from the bathroom and the next thing you know she was asking us if we were ready to order.  We said no we'd like more time.  My idea for more time meant more than 5 minutes but 2 minutes later ""Are you ready to order"".  I think my fiance felt rushed and he just settled for something that sounded good.  I had the Chicken Madeira (my favorite) and we waited.  We didn't wait for too long as our food came out.  One thing I noticed was that there were entirely too many mushrooms on my chicken madeira.  I like mushrooms but they should've spent more time and had more cheese put on the chicken and more asparagus.  Overall, the food was good and I was glad we had the gift card.  Next time, I hope we have a better waiter--one that doesn't rush us.  Secondly, next time lets hope my food can turn out like it has previous times.  I'd go again, and maybe we'll get a new waitress and awesome food instead of OK food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=320

Alexandra E.,"Manassas, VA",1,115,47,4.0,7/5/2012,"This restaurant has been consistently delicious at many different locations. Their menu is phenomenal, consisting of everything from seafood to Mexican to Asian to burgers. It's like 20 pages long- no joke. Today, I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas (corn tortillas with chicken and tomatillo sauce, served with corn cakes, black beans and sour cream). I've had them before and they are scrumptious. My mom ordered a burger which was cooked to perfection. The french fries are mouth-watering. The service always seems to be good and the food is out in no time. The burger was $12 and the tortillas were $14. In the past, I've had the enchiladas (not good), a burger (always juicy), and a combination of their lunch specials (all good). The Lemoncello cake is moist and refreshing and the Kahlua Cheesecake is truly delicious. The cheesecakes themselves don't seem to be that special. The portions at this restaurant are HUGE- so come hungry! Oh and one more thing- I don't know if it's just me, but their tile floors throughout the restaurant are super slippery.

Jeff W.,"Falls Church, VA",192,532,3,2.0,9/5/2007,"Just got back from my first Cheesecake Factory experience and I wasn't impressed but wasn't offended either.  The first thing that I thought was odd was that the place has a very grand, open presentation to it but had these cheap little plastic drink mugs and a menu that read like a diner.  Not to mention a very average basket of bread.  The menu is actually too diverse, erasing any identity it was hoping to establish for itself.   Before even trying the food I felt like they were trying to pull the wool over my eyes by having such an elegant atmosphere and the waiters in their tuxedo shirts.  I really felt like I was supposed to be so wowed by the scenery that I wouldn't pay attention to the food.  Well once the food did arrive, my suspicions were correct.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't special.  The prices weren't as outrageous as I had been preparing myself for but the portions were large.  Salt seems to be the favorite ingredient, maybe so that the sweetness of their cheesecakes stands out?? Speaking of cheesecake, I couldn't leave without trying a piece.  Normally content with just plain, undoctored cheesecake I decided to be adventurous and try the tiramisu cheesecake.  It really only resembled cheesecake in shape.  Way too light and wet for cheesecake and pretty much tasted like a piece of tiramisu, which probably wasn't the objective. Anyway, I have no reason to go back but I really don't have any hatred towards this place.  I didn't feel cheated or taken advantage of; just apathetic towards the entire experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=340

Went on my birthday and got the grilled salmon lunch special, which I'd gotten a few times in the past at other CF's. Sadly it was undercooked. At first I figured ""whatever, I eat sushi"". But as I ate a bit further, it just plain got disgusting. I ended up feeling sick to my stomach for most of that day and the next. They took the fish off my check, but the (figurative) bad taste still lingers.  Otherwise, there's not much that's more special about this Cheesecake Factory over any of the others.

Jennifer L.,"Centreville, VA",0,4,,1.0,7/25/2011,"My friend wanted to go there for her birthday, so we all went there to celebrate it with her. The wait was an hour long, so we went to the bar to get some drinks while waiting. The bartender took a long time to even acknowledge us, and when he did he was unfriendly. The drinks were $12 and they were not strong at all, almost no alcohol was in them. Luckily we got seated in like 45 minutes, we were starving and ready to eat. We waited at our table for like 7 minutes, but no server greeted us. We had to get the attention of someone that was passing by to get some drinks.  Our server comes back like 10 minutes later with our drinks and bread. The bread was cold, but we were starving so we eat it anyway. It took another 10 minutes for the server to come get our order. We tried to make the best of it since we had a lot of time to talk to each other and were enjoying the time together.  The food came out 30 minutes later and was luke-warm. We had finished our drinks, but the server did not even come to take any drink orders. My friend is allergic to shellfish and asked for the Jambalaya with only chicken and no shrimp. She was about to eat it until she saw there was shrimp in it. We tried to get the servers attention, but with no avail. She was too hungry that she just ate some of our food. The one thing good about Cheesecake is their big portions. But the pasta I had was pretty salty. I think the pasta water they use has a lot of salt in them. The burger came out too well cooked, but we just kept eating since we doubted the server would help us. We didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for a burger to come out.  The cheesecakes we ordered were pretty good but the server took a long time to bring it out too. The coffee he gave us was pretty cold. Everything we had was luke-warm at this restaurant, very disappointed in the quality of food and service here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=340

Josh Y.,"Fairfax, VA",4,48,24,4.0,1/26/2010,"01/14/2010, Thursday, dinner Cheesecake always gave me an impression of flashy decoration, average service, ok food and up scaled prices. Therefore, I never cared to write a review about this restaurant, even I have dined there on several occasions involuntarily. Until this experience, I thought that it's about time for a review. It's about 6:30pm, still early. We got our table right away. No waiting line sounds more like a miracle at Cheesecake Factory. Our waitress was, in general, friendly, attentive, professional and knowledgeable about their food. All my friends ordered soft drink, I was the only one having water. They got their drink filled up all the time without requesting. But I had to ask for more water almost the entire meal. That's the only ""nit picking"" I could come up with about her service. 3.5 stars. I was not quite hungry that night and only wanted something light. So, I picked Seared Tuna Tataki Salad as my entrée. This is a quote from their menu, ""Pacific Albacore Tuna Lightly Seared and Served Rare with Avocado, Tomato and Mixed Greens Tossed with Wasabi Vinaigrette."" Tuna was fresh, lightly seared, thickly sliced and presented beautifully. It literally melted in my mouth. The menu should have also mentioned about the sauce on top of tuna and avocado and tomato. If I am not mistaken, that sauce consists of finely chopped ginger, green onion, hot pepper with light soy sauce and a hint of sesame seed oil. Saltiness, spiciness, and different aroma were all well balanced. That sauce made this entire dish stand out. Now, to the mixed greens, I could taste the freshness and the crunchiness from every single bite of that mix greens. The Wasabi Vinaigrette dressing had a touch of sweetness from balsamic vinegar and a tangy bite from wasabi. The mixed greens were a perfect companion to the main character, albacore tuna. Of course, what can go wrong with fresh avocado and tomato. This dish is a great example of ""East Meets West"". 5 stars. My dessert was to share a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, ""Layers of Flourless Godiva Chocolate Cake, Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and Chocolate Mousse."" Each layer has its own distinct taste. And yet when you combine them together, you just can't stop taking the next bite. What can I say, I like both chocolate and cheesecake. This is just another great combination. Well, a little bit on the sweet side though. 4 stars. Grand total: 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=340

Adri T.,"Wake Forest, NC",80,258,768,4.0,11/11/2009,"Typical Cheesecake Factory located in Fair Oaks mall in Fairfax.  The wait was not too terribly long for a Sunday night (15 minutes at 7pm). We were seated as soon as our buzzer went off and taken to our booth. Their booths are much more spacious and enjoyable over their half booth/half free seaters where you have to get too close for comfort with some stranger. Happy about the ""private"" booth, we sat down and began to peruse the mini novella of a menu. Since we'd all dined at a CcF before, we really did not need as long as we were given to make a drink selection before the waitress arrived. When she finally did arrive we offered up our selections and they were quickly returned. All beverages were well maintained throughout the meal and we had no issues here. Food selections were customized from the menu and everyone's special requests were adhered to. I always order the Thai Lettuce Wraps for an entree. They are artfully displayed on the plate and taste as good as they look. My only suggestion would be that they serve them with wet naps, since I needed one when I was done with this messy build your own wrap meal. Most people had enough food to take home and make another meal, which justifies the prices at this place. Check was split as we requested and no grumpy server when we tossed out three separate credit cards. We all ordered cheesecake to go and were disappointed to find no plastic ware or napkins were given in the to go bags (especially since we were going to be consuming this in a hotel room). Other than this tiny snafu, we had no issues.  I always find what I order to be consistently delish, and the service to be cheerful, attentive, and on point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=340
Edik Z.,"Schenectady, NY",0,13,2,2.0,12/10/2012,"Went there for a quick bite on Sunday. Kind of late lunch.  Problem one - they set at least two parties of people with the similar makeup before us - both parties came in later than we did. When pointed that out to the hostess, she kind of shrugged it off, like things happen, as long as they don't happen to her, it's Ok.  Problem two - went to the table and the table was dirty, the seat on which I was supposed to land was both dirty and wet. When pointed that out to the hostess - she kind of shrugged it off, like things happen, and disappeared into the abyss to find a bus-boy with a rug. She was above the menial things.  Problem three - the manager. He utterly incapable of running this ship, but compensated his ineptitude and that of his staff, by a well-practiced ""I am so sorry"" speech. He had it down pat, he was sorry for the wait, he was sorry for the dirt, he was sorry for being sorry, he was so sorry that even NOT offered to pay for the drinks (consisting of coke and water) or for deserts, or even one dish. He then took his sorry excuse for a manager and disappeared so I could show him the dirty silverware. But it's Ok, and I am fairly confident he would've been sorry about that too.  The waitress was nice and prompt, I guess the fact that she showed up in the middle of me ripping the new one to the manager helped, and the food was good.

Wally Z.,"Fairfax, VA",0,6,,1.0,3/10/2013,"We decided to finally write this review now because these past few days we've been looking for a nice place to celebrate a special event and as we were looking through Yelp's reviews for nearby restaurants, we came across the Cheesecake Factory. It surprised us greatly that the reviews for this place were so high! So, we decided to write exactly what this place is about. We visited this restaurant several months ago, more specifically the first week of September 2012. It was not our lucky day. Overall, the food and service was horrible. At the beginning, we ordered sodas and a strawberry lemonade. The young waitress completly forgot about the lemonade. We reminded her in 25 minutes and she finally served it.  We then ordered the most expensive dish--filet minion. The wait time was very long. When we were served the food, it was just the meat-- no side dishes and we were told that it will be a bit longer. Nobody served us the side dish, however, until we reminded them after 20 minutes of waiting. The filet minion we got was horrible: it was very thick and it looks like it was a cheap piece of meat just tenderized like a meat chop and there were a lot of chewy pieces that could hardly be chewed so we couldn't eat  it at all.

First, there was a wait on the bread that is brought to the table before your meal. I ordered the turkey burger sandwich with fries. When my burger arrived I took a bite to find a piece of paper inside my burger. I immediately told the waitress, who didn't seem that alarmed. I had to instruct her to take it back for a new order. She asked if I would like a salad or soup while I waited. I declined and chose to eat my fries while waiting. The manager came by and apologized, but did not offer to comp my meal.

The menu is enormous, and for that reason, I think the quality of the food and speed of service suffers. I usually end up waiting about half an hour for my food. The server always offers bread, and the bread always gets to the table about twenty minutes later. The food is hit-or-miss. The roasted veggie pizza was great, but the spicy chicken salad was downright disappointing. Very skimpy on the veggies to be mixed in with the mountain of lettuce, and the chicken had most definitely been sandbagged, so not sure why it took half an hour! It was dry and chewy and nasty. The cheesecake is always good, but it seems like the average slice has gotten smaller over the years. For $7 a pop, you'd better hook it up. The entree portions are large, but overall I'd say this place is overpriced and overrated.

We ordered the white pizza (which although our waitress said was enough for one person...was huge!) and the fish tacos (again...a huge meal!) Both were delicious and I would absolutely order them again.  My only complaint was the tables are so small, we had very little room for our plates and drinks, and the tables are very close together, so close that a waiter knocked our bread basket on the floor as he tried to serve another table.  Overall good food, good service, still overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Tracy O.,"Haymarket, VA",0,60,,3.0,11/1/2011,I love the Cheesecake Factory.  Of course their cheesecake is amazing and their food portions are huge.  However depending on the wait time ...you can wait for a long time just to get a seat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Melinda C.,"San Francisco, CA",15,560,,4.0,11/29/2008,We were in Fairfax on business and ate here twice in a row ... by choice.  I won't even lie - I really enjoy Cheesecake Factory.  You always know there's something that you will like.  I love my Chicken enchiladas (they're called something else on the menu but they are basically enchiladas) and my morning sunrise burrito.  Yum yum yum.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Michael R.,"Haymarket, VA",0,13,,2.0,7/24/2012,"Somebody needs to explain this place to me.  You can get a better burger at Five Guys, a better plate of pasta at Pizza Hut, a better steak at Steak n' Shake, a better taco at Taco Bell, a better omelette at Denny's, and a better eggroll at Panda Express.  My point is, this place tries to do everything but does none of it well.  They are definitely into quantity, not quality.  It is basically a diner dressed up a little, with their prices jacked up a lot!  If you want a huge plate of expensive food that is about the same caliber of a Denny's, then go for it.  Be careful when you pick up your cheap plastic mug of water in the beginning.  The place appears slightly fancy because of the building structure and high ceilings, so you kind of expect a ""glass"" and expect it to be heavy like a glass mug would be.  Not here, here it is cafeteria style plastic mugs.  Wait staff is friendly, but look more like orderlies in a hospital with there head to toe white outfits.  Well, I have to go use the restroom as I usually do about 15 minutes after I eat here.  Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Susan T.,"Gainesville, VA",0,4,,2.0,9/12/2013,"Just visited the ""factory""  for lunch with my sister. Orderd our favorite appetizer to share that we always get. The first bite tasted ok but by the second bite we knew something was off.  The appt comes in three. We both decided we did not want any more of it so we sent the third one back. We explained to the waiter that we have had the appetizer at least a dozen times before and there was definitely something wrong with this one. He offered us another one but we declined and said we'd just have our salads. Even they were off. The manager came over and asked about our meal and we told him about the appetizer never mentioning that the whole meal was off. We Never asked for anything to be taken off. We have had many great meals there but I have to say we were both very insulted when the server brought us our check and said they had taken something off because of the appetizer. We thought ""oh isn't that nice"" until we saw the bill. They took off $3 for the 1/3 of the appetizer returned and charged us for the other 2/3 that we had tried to eat. I wish they had just not bothered. A restaurant that really wants to keep their customers coming back would make it right and would never insult their customers. I know which restaurants they are and they will get my business from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Random D.,"Herndon, VA",6,122,1,4.0,9/10/2007,"Went to cheesecake factory on a Friday night - I reached there about 11:30 PM ( they close at 12:30 AM on fridays). I had been there at least a few times before (mostly at the bar which I should say is pretty well stocked and is well presented). The place still looks new. At the time I went there were hardly any folks there. We got ourself seated outside.  We are mostly there for some drinks and finger food. Being a vegetarian (ok an ovo-lacto vegetarian!), my choices are fairly straight. Ordered the Avocado Egg Roll and the Lettuce rolls (sans the chicken satay) along with a few house drinks.  The service was pretty good. I have always thought that the waiters at the Cheesecake factory are very professional (even though food may sometime show up late) and this one was the same as well.  The drinks and food showed up fairly quickly (since the place was almost closing) along with the drinks.   Food was pretty decent and nothing out of the ordinary. Ordered a Strawberry Cheesecake -fairly standard fare.  I recommend this Cheesecake factory for folks that want to get together for a few drinks and some light food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Amy B.,"Fairfax, VA",2,54,,4.0,4/14/2010,"I have been here several times and it is pretty much the same as any other ccf..Big portions, good food..I love the Monte Cristo. I also love the BBQ chicken salad. The Lunch deals are good, you can get alot of food for very cheap. I have had a ton of stuff on the menu, and have never been really disapointed. And of course all the cheesecake is yummmy..except I had the peanut butter once and can remember it being a little too rich for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Reginald T.,"Washington, DC",15,52,,4.0,2/10/2009,"Went to the mall and decided we needed a little lunch so headed to the Cheesecake Factory. Been here once before for lunch and has a good experience on the patio. Little cold for that but headed in. Our waitress was nice and pleasant and very knowledgeable about the food and specials. We opted to go with the lunch specials as we did on our first visit. This time around I had the Salisbury Steak. I was very excited because I haven't had Salisbury steak since I was a kid eating TV dinners with pops. Our food took awhile, which seemed like forever because we were trying to make a movie at Fairfax-de-lux. I do fin it somewhat annoying when the server says it will be right out and does arrive for another 10 minutes. This is just a ploy to calm you down a bit. Usually the food does come out immediately afterwards but not this time. I was oK b/c we still had time for the movie. Food finally arrived and it was well worth the wait. Salisbury steak but the improved version of dads microwave version. Don't tell him that hush hush. My dish came with mashed potatoes and green beans and of course I had plenty of left overs b/c as you all may know whose been there, they have large portions. Love leftovers from the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Christina J.,"Burke, VA",0,11,,2.0,4/28/2008,"LIke all cheesecake factories, and (most) corporate owned chain restaurantes, CF is just mediocre.  Not great, not bad, and definitely don't get their salads.  With a menu as ridiculously expansive as theirs, it's difficult to get quality food, IMO.  I don't think I'd come here on my own unless I needed a quick bite to eat, or if friends wanted to come here. Service is hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Deidra B.,"Fairfax, VA",0,38,,2.0,1/18/2009,"We had a great experience at a Cheesecake Factory in MD so we figured we'd really like this place too. We were sorely disappointed. First: the wait. It seems like every teenager in Fairfax goes here (maybe because it's in a mall?). After finally being seated, it took forever for our waitress to take our order. Then my friend received her dinner and the waitress noticed I hadn't received my order after about 20 minutes. She apologized but never brought my dinner! Finally after sitting there for 45 minutes I just asked for an appetizer (I don't remember what it was). Oddly it tasted like peanuts. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth. After a year I went back (recently) and found that the wait was the same and although I actually received my order in a timely manner, the service was unfriendly and inattentive. And the food was nothing to remember. I won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Michelle C.,"Centreville, VA",0,15,,3.0,1/29/2009,"Spurred on by a $25 gift certificate we received for Christmas we decided to give them a try one recent Sunday night.  The restaurant is amazing.  Unfortunately, most of Fair Oaks mall restaurants look and taste the same.  And while Cheesecake Factory is a chain, it is definitely a step up for this particular mall.  They were busy, but fortunately no wait when we arrived at 7pm.   The menu is a bit over the top with all the choices.  Overwhelmingly so.  And when I asked our fabulous server what she recommended, she pointed out at least a dozen things and would have kept going had I not told her that was certainly enough to think about.  That said, they seem to offer a lot of the same cuts and main ingredients with a few different sauces or cuts.  I eventually chose a chicken dish from the special menu.  I have a hard time paying $15 for an a La carte pasta dish from the best of places and what was so special about the special menu was that it was a few bucks cheaper.  That said, it still cost $13.  It was a huge portion (I can see why American waistlines are so big looking at their portion sizes!).  I can't remember the name of the dish, but it was a thai chicken type dish.  I was impressed by the fresh ginger which really came through in the dish.  My husband had a new orleans-y pasta dish with chicken that was so-so.  Again, huge portion, but not so big on flavor.  The chicken was fried/crisp and pretty bland.  I thought a spicy cajun sauce would have perked it up, but not so much.  He enjoyed it though.  They don't have a kids menu, but the server said they have several kid sized options- sliders, pasta, etc.  My son chose the sliders with cheese and fries. Which were good but not great. You can imagine my horrified suprise when the bill came and I found that my son's meal cost $9.50  before tax.   Overall, the service was great- glasses never empty, food served at the proper temp, checked on the appropriate number of times, etc. Our $25 gift card didn't go very far, and it isn't the type of place we'd visit every weekend for our family ""date"", but it was definitely a good experience. Though, they really need to re-think their children's offerings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Kevin J.,"Washington, DC",22,255,,3.0,1/12/2009,"Essentially Cheesecake factory is a giant cafeteria in disguise. I really want to give this place four stars but nothing has blown me away. They have excellent salads but the look and size of them has been more impressive than the actual taste. This is a very strong 3 stars (would give 3.5 if possible). Service has always been great for the most part Breakfast: have had their breakfast burrito and a few other breakfast platters, all of which I was not so impressed with. Don't get me wrong, everything was pretty good but that about it. Fortunately there breakfast is pretty reasonably priced and when it's nice outside they usually have ample outside seating if you eat late on the weekend like I do (11-12ish). Good coffee, nothing mind blowing. Overall breakfast here is worth it if you close by, a good value and good quality food. Dinner and appetizers: The guacamole is a total rip, skip it. Tostada salad is tasty but a dieter's nightmare as it is COVERED in dressing. I'd like to go back and try their sandwiches. An update will follow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
Daniel A.,"Herndon, VA",0,11,,2.0,3/4/2012,"We had always wondered what it was like to eat here because of the crowds of people waiting to get in. My fathers birthday he recieved a gift card, what a letdown. The restaurant was beautiffully decorated, but the lighting was so dim that we couldn't appreciate it. The only dish we would order again would be the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake.The cuban sandwich left a lot to be desired, being cuban, they could benefit from a lesson. Lesson #1 the sandwich should not be saturated with butter, just lightly brushed. The crust of the ""everything pizza"" was satisfactory, but the center was soggy with grease. The BLT salad consisted of an entire head of lettuce, not cut except one slice down the middle, and perched on top was way too much dressing, feta cheese, and the too other main ingredients (bacon and tomato) were few and far between. Don't waste your money, get the cheesecake and go home. Would I ever go back? No.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fairfax?start=360
