Michele D.,"Wayne, NJ",442,255,1081,3.0,12/6/2016,Nothing special about this Cheesecake Factory. Food was good and service was slow. Gets busy for lunch and dinner with all the tourists in the area(me being one of them). The menu here is huge and so much to choose from. I never have room for desert since their portions are really big. I always say leave room but never do. They have a larger outdoor seating area for when the weather is good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=20
Thomas M.,"Wheat Ridge, CO",61,28,5,1.0,12/9/2017,"Worst Customer Service & Food! I was staying at a local hotel very close to the Cheesecake Factory and decided to call ahead to order a pickup order. Called around 8pm at night and they said it would be 15-20mins till the food would be ready, not a problem. I arrived about 25 mins after calling to find out the food wasn't ready and it would be another 20-30mins till it was. I was informed they are busy with customers who are seated in the restaurant and they would get to my meal when they could. Excuse me? I'm pretty sure the money I have means and works the same as the money of those seated down inside the restaurant. I waited for my $20 Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken that I ordered. I asked if I could get a slice of cheesecake in addition to the meal and the employee's sarcastic response, ""You know you could have ordered the cheesecake when you ordered your meal but I guess we can just add it on?"" Pardon me, I'm sorry if it's such a huge inconvenience for you to do your job and cut me a slice of cheesecake and take my money. About an hour after I called in my order it was finally ready. Once I got back to my hotel I noticed that there was no bread included in the meal, which there always is, and there were 2, 2 whole pieces of chicken on my entire dish that I paid $20 for! Between the horrible customer service, over priced dish, and the food that doesn't come how it should, I'm over this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=20

Mug with water was dirty. I think the issue is the dishwasher. Or the fact that no one checks after it's ""cleaned"". Everyone enjoyed their food.

Joe M.,"Boca Raton, FL",128,488,26,4.0,12/29/2016,I generally avoid chain restaurants like the plague. Went because we were armed with gift cards. Twenty minute wait at 8:30 on a Tuesday night during Christmas break. Nice bar area to wait until we were called. My Old Fashioned was a bit on the sweet side but otherwise solid. Server was pleasant and knew the extensive menu. Always concerned about a menu which is too extensive. Had the guacamole dip and chips as well as edaname for apps. Guac was fantastic Decided on a chicken cutlet  entrée for my main and it was outstanding. Three large pieces of lightly breaded chicken with smashed potatoes and asparagus. So much that I gave one cutlet to my son. .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=20
Argelia M.,"Hialeah, FL",99,150,419,4.0,6/24/2016,"I'm not a big fan of CF only because everything is so delicious, but crazy high in calories! I have eaten at CF many times and I've never had any issues with their food or service.  Today I decided to try the Mexican Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos (3 per order) and they were yummy. At only 250 calories (bonus) the chicken is topped with veggies, avocado, roasted corn salsa and a creamy sauce. They include a side of salsa if you need additional dressing.  I also tried the Fresh Basil, Tomato and Cheese Flatbread (330 calories). This was surprisingly delicious and the bread held up very well. The taste was on point and I was happy to have made a small dent of 580 calories to my day.

We asked for an outside table and the host, without saying anything and without even smiling. We have two strollers and she didn't even hold the door for us when we were following her to our table. On the other hand, our waitress Kaleigh, was very very nice. She was always asking if everything was ok and even talk with our kids. She was amazing and the food was good.

Karen W.,"Royal Oak, MI",124,526,591,4.0,3/13/2016,"Stopped in for dinner with my friend and we grabbed a table outside.  I was pleasantly surprised that the menu indicates which items are gluten free and they have plenty of options!  We decided to share some items, the beet salad, Evelyn's favorite pasta and of course cheesecake! The beet salad was excellent and nice and light. The pasta was also light as it was just an olive oil sauce with gluten free pasta, eggplant, broccoli, peppers and sundried to tomatoes. It was absolutely delicious. We ended with the Godiva cheesecake and holy hell was that divine. Talk about an amazing meal, and from a chain restaurant!  The only thing that could have used some improvement was speed. It took about 15 mins to get out drinks, the salad was out before the drinks  and our server disappeared and took awhile to get us out check.

It really need to take them 40 min to figure out that they are not able to cook the Penni in time? To us this is a lie, possibly they ran out of it without admitting !

Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",937,1409,6947,2.0,1/22/2016,"Typically I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory primarily because I like places that give you free bread, large portions, and big cups to drink out of. I don't ask for a whole lot in life. That being said, after my last visit I may have to find a new place... Came in for lunch one day. Normal lunch rush, nothing out of this world busy. We were sat immediately at our table and waited for our server. And waited. And waited. And waited some more. Finally we found someone after a non exaggerated 10 minutes who said they would be our service. Note: they didn't say what happened to our server or if we were theirs and they just forgot about us. At this time we still had no water, no menu- nothing. Eventually we were given the items above and were able to get beverages and a few minutes later got to order. I had a simple Buffalo blast appetizer and fries- healthy, right? I am always a fan of anything made with Buffalo sauce and anything fried so in that regard they can't mess up. Our food arrived and our newly granted server stopped to check on us sporadically- I still feel like our person either quit or didn't want to deal with us because you could tell that this girl was not supposed to wait on us. The service was very spotty and we never knew who to go to when we needed something. Long story short it was over an hour and a half spent there on a simple lunch. Good thing I liked the person I was with and not dumping a date. We spoke to the manager about our experience and he apologized, offered us some cheesecake which we both declined. It wasn't about getting something for free. I could have had a meal that fed me in courses in the amount of time I spent waiting on some appetizers.

The waiter disappeared for a long time. It took 25 minutes to get my hot tea. The hostess rolled her eyes and refused to seat us because her computer said there was no table available, even though the patio was 2/3 empty. The food was mediocre, portions smaller than usual.

It was like walking through a trash site. Garbage all over the floor. I thought the lighting would be somewhat romantic, but it was opposite. So we sat inside at the bar. Table was so dirty. They cleaned it. But it was still sticky. Mind you, the air was beyond freezing. So cold, the napkin blew away. I couldn't even eat my food I was so cold. It took forever for them to take our order. The bar was almost empty. Ok. So they took our order. Seriously it took 45 to an hour to get our food. I asked to substitute pasta for vegetables. They brought me the wrong vegetable and.....the food was COLD.  They told me they would bring me the correct vegetable. By that time I was already done with my meal. Just a bad experience over all.

Jeanne M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",460,486,1414,3.0,5/28/2016,"After a very disappointing light meal on the beach, we needed some real food.  The Cheesecake Factory is always dependable.  We only needed something to top off what we'd just had, so my daughter and I decided to split an order of the nachos with chicken, while my husband opted for the French dip. Our order came out in a pretty short time.  The plate was piled with chips, guac, sour cream, salsa and cheese.  The chips were outstanding, very thin and crisp, just the way I love them.  There was an inexplicable sweet flavor to the dish, like there was just a drizzle of BBQ sauce.  While it wasn't objectionable, it wasn't what I was expecting.  The only real problem was that there were only about 5 small bites of chicken on the whole plate of nachos, which was disappointing considering how good the rest was. I wish I'd been able to try the low carb lemon cheesecake, but I figured we'd already spent enough between the two restaurants.  I've always been a fan of their cheesecake, especially the Godiva chocolate, but next time, that lemon is going down!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=20

Jennifer A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",415,44,60,3.0,12/3/2017,"Review update*** In my initial review I had given this location five stars because of prior great experiences. Unfortunately today was not as great so I am updating my review.  We came in today for brunch. And sat outside to enjoy the nice weather and Las Olas view. Our server came over and greeted us, he came back quickly with our first round of drinks and told us he would be right back. Unfortunately, my family and I were left there with our drinks getting watered down and no one came ""right back"" to take our order. It took 20 minutes for someone to come over and that person not being our server but she did take an order for us. After that it took another 35 minutes for our food to come outside. From the time we were sat and received a first round of drinks, the total time before we received our food was almost an hour from beginning to end we spent almost two hours here when all we were expecting to do was have a quick brunch before some holiday shopping.  I do understand that weekends are busy but I do expect more from such a reputable establishment. I work in the food industry and 20 minutes to take an order is not okay and 35 minute ticket times on lunch entrees is a bit ridiculous. Even if someone had come over and checked up on us, told us there was a delay in the kitchen, asked if our drinks were ok (which the first margarita we got wasn't that great) we would have felt better and been more understanding. But it's a terrible feeling to feel that you were looking forward to relaxing and catching up with family but instead we were anxious and hungry and the bad experience consumed the conversation and ruined the entire afternoon.  I did make a manager aware of the situation and he was very nice and polite when he came over so that is appreciated. The food was good as usual but not worth waiting an hour. Next time it may be better to check out the other great brunch places on Las Olas and only come to this location when I have 2 hours to spare on a meal.  _________________ _________ __ Original review* From beginning to end a delightful experience! We started our meal with two appetizers, the fried Mac and cheese and the blue cheese and pear flat bread. I fell in love the the fried mac and the delicious tomato based sauce they came in was fantastic. I also loved the hint of sweetness that the pear adds to the flatbread without overpowering the other flavors. And just when I thought it couldn't get any better the entrees arrived.  I love great presentation and my boyfriend and I both had beautiful photo worthy dishes! He had he Thai Coconut Lime Chicken which was great. One bite wasn't enough, I kept picking off of his plate. I had the Miso Salmon which can be best described in one word, ""wow!"" The dish was bursting with amazing flavor and I couldn't hen enough of  the miso sauce. I asked for more so I could mix it in with my rice, such a great mix. This is definitely my new salmon dish.  We ended our meal with the celebration cheesecake, my daughter was instantly drawn to the fun colors. It tasted just as good as it looked.  The service was just as great as the food. Our server greeted us quickly, was very nice and attentive during the entire time we were there. He was already offering refills as we came close to the bottom of our sodas and was so nice to offer to pack our leftovers so we could have space for dessert. We will be back soon, thanks for a great time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale

The waitstaff was definitely lacking in efficiency---had to ask for water and bread like, 5 different times---but the food and menu totally made up for it! Naturally, such a large menu would stir a bit of uneasiness in my ordering confidence. Luckily, I was craving a salad, so rather than an entire booklet of options, I was left deciding between just one large PAGE of options! :) The whole grain bread at the start was delicious, but my Asian Taco Lettuce Wraps were AMAZING.

The person in the to go booth has no way to communicate with the kitchen and has to constantly run back to check on orders while also taking phone calls and tons of clients that keep walking up to the to go desk. They tell you to wait, then your order is brought out and no one tells you anything, so youre sitting waiting for nothing. Also they never have cup holders. Really need to get it together guys!

I asked our server if I could get the Farfalle with Roasted Garlic with steak instead of the chicken, and he made it happen.  He delivered my meal exactly how I wanted, with the steak cooked to temp and the pasta saucy and lots of garlic.  It absolutely slayed my craving.  Thanks for a great meal after a really tiring day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale

Marqus R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1384,3324,13873,3.0,5/2/2017,"I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory location a number of times since it first opened. I remember when it did first open how overwhelmed I was with its stunning faux ruin décor, its high ceilings and leafed columns creating a whimsical of a temple in the lost City of Atlantis. And yes, I'm still impressed with it and of all the Cheesecake factories I've been at, this is the tops in interior beauty.  Now as to the food their specialty is of course cheesecake of which they have all sorts and verities, but they also have an extensive menu offering a lot more than that. They have all kinds of sandwiches, burger, steaks, chops and seafood. Having had a good number of their offerings over the years, I'd have to say very good. Some were in fact innovative like their kale and quinoa salad, but for me nothing really extra special in preparation, combination, taste or flavor; just solid good food.  It may just be my luck, but every time I've been here, the service has been incredibly slow, even when I am about the only one in the place.

Clarissa K.,"Hollywood, FL",2319,538,2075,3.0,1/22/2017,"So I read a lot of reviews not at this location but the others that all laugh about you probably came because you got a Gift Card. That's the group we fell in for this visit. So we figured Las Olas location is a step up from Aventura. Have not been back to this location for 10 years at least. Now that I have Yelp I will be able to refresh my memory on why not to come here when you have many other great choices on Las Olas.  We arrived a little after 10 AM when they open for Sunday Brunch. First we parked at a Public Parking lot one street North. As usual I pay the master meter for 3 hours because I don't need a surprise of a parking ticket. There is a walk through that will get you on Las Olas and cross the street and you have arrived right on the corner. You can't miss it as they all look the same decoration and that peachy color facade.  We asked for a table outside on Las Olas so we could people watch. Mostly homeless begging for money very sad. Anyway the service let's just cut to the chase was lousy as many other reviews will point out. My husband noticed two tables that arrived after us but we were all served at the same time.  So he waited for sugar, cream, and food.  To start I had a Peach Bellini it was ok but considering it was to contain peach liqueur and champagne mine was lacking either. My better half had coffee and he said it was ok.  For brunch I had the Monte Cristo and my husband Eggs Benedict with an order of load potatoes.  He loved the sriracha mayo served with it.  Mine was underwhelming and the hash browns had too much salt.  The unfortunate news is that we only used half the Gift Card so we'll have to come back to use the balance. This place reminds me why I dislike chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale

Stephanie R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",256,168,690,2.0,4/18/2017,"Ok ok - I just feel that The Cheesecake Factory is TOTALLY overrated!  I've been to several venues and at different locations, but the experience tends to be the same - long wait, slow service, bland food, and overpriced.  With regards to The Cheesecake Factory on Las Olas, there is outdoor seating adjacent to Las Olas and indoor seating at booths, tables, or the bar area. Yet, there's always a wait. My last experience was poor - we waited about 45 minutes to be seating and, once we were seated at a booth in the bar area, the server took about 10 minutes to greet us since a tap had exploded in the bar (it was loud, messy and chaotic). When we were greeted by the server, she felt flustered, which is understandable, but then that mood created an uninviting and unpleasant experience for our party. Once we ordered, our food was delivered in about 20-30 minutes ... not too bad for the venue being PACKED! But, I couldn't help but notice the table of 4 sitting next to us that still hadn't been served their meals. It was a young family and I could tell the two boys were hungry and were getting anxious... the parents were patient and kind to the server but eventually asked for the manager. I felt sympathetic toward them but it only added to the already unenthused mood I was feeling. The food was filling but not worth the price - I have never thought The Cheesecake Factory was anything to rave about.   Overall - Don't bother with The Cheesecake Factory; rather, try another option that's more original on Las Olas, like Royal Pig, Big City Tavern, or Louie Bossi.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale

First off the Sheppards Pie is not a Sheppards Pie, its far from it, lets say its a combination of bad meat and bad veggies served as its a splat on a roof shingle. I've had REAL Sheppards pie, this is a poor substitute for a reinvention beyond awful. My partner ordered a Cobb Salad, well soggy lettuce does not make a salad. We said no egg, no avocados, but it seems the cook felt like adding them anyways. Poor order entry! As a business owner in the food field I know how to take an order, listen to the client and follow through in the kitchen. Granted this place makes its bucks and doesn't not care about reviews but I will still say this place has gone down hill, its typical corp food with no soul.

We needed walking out because they never replaced the dirty silverware after TWO requests. The manager did not pay any mind and did not address the issue whatsoever.

Christy A.,"Saint Louis, MO",4673,1279,11749,4.0,7/16/2016,"Of all the Cheesecake locations I've experienced from Houston to St. Louis, this Fort Lauderdale location has impressed me the most. Located on the beautiful & trendy Las Olas Blvd, it's patio seating is ideal. However, if you are dodging Florida's scorching sun there's plenty of options indoors as well.  It's a chain sooooo...the interior décor is pretty standard to any other Cheesecake Factory. The hostess was pleasant and seated us immediately for lunch after asking if we had a preference.  Our server, who's name I can't remember but she was a doll. Very prompt, not too overbearing, personable and made sure our food arrived as we had specifically ordered it.    The Skinnylicious Grilled Herb Salmon is my usual plate, which was superb by the way. We also tried the mushroom lettuce wraps for the first time. They were ""different"" kind of like a lettuce burrito. I'm usually in hunger-mode so having to play with my food when it arrives didn't tickle my fancy. I opt for the dig-in method.

I had family in town from Canada and decided to bring them here for dinner. I realized at 9pm on saturday night we would have a wait, especially for a party of 8. We were told 40 minutes and decided to stay. But after an hour wait, and a party of 10 arriving after us and seated before us, we were ready to leave. Eventually we got our table and the server was very friendly and fast. The bread was delicious as always. The food was just okay this time. Out of four kids meals..none were eaten. Not even the fries. The grilled cheese doesnt look like grilled cheese being very toasted and cut into strips like grilled cheese fingers. The kids cheese pizza didnt look appetizing at all.  The adult food was just okay with the exception of my boyfriends steak which he enjoyed. But everyone was ready to leave after the whole ordeal and did not even order dessert.

The soup of the day, cream mushroom, was amazing.  The cup size is HUGE.  There were small chunks of mushroom in it.   The Farro salad is found on the skinnyilicious menu.  For 590 calories you get mixed greens, feta cheese, slice red onions, faro, cucumbers, and ripe red tomatoes.  There is a vinaigrette dressing that makes it taste Greek.   They always bring out sour dough bread and a sweet brown bread with real butter.   There are plenty of menu items to choose from with various calorie options.  I am happy they have added the skinny menu with healthy portion options.   We didn't finish with dessert this time, but usually do. I really enjoy the Linda Chocolate cake.   There is parking behind cheesecake factory in a garage with a meter machine you pay.  Or on street  parking along Las Olas Boulevard with a meter.   For a chain, I think this is a good restaurant with consistent quality of food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=60

Amanda C.,"Chicago, IL",171,669,474,4.0,1/15/2016,"We walked into Cheesecake Factory on a Thursday evening. It was pretty empty and we decided to sit outside for dinner. It seemed to annoy the host, he was pretty rude and dismissive. It seemed like an inconvenience for us to sit outside and we seemed to bother him for whatever reason. I Almost decided to leave but it was my fathers birthday and he was looking forward to eating there. Glad we didn't leave though, our waiter, James, was the nicest most attentive waiter. He definitely turned it around for me!  We started with the crab and artichoke dip which was delicious. Very flavorful. We the ordered our meals and James was extremely patient being that the kids weren't 100% sure what they wanted. I ordered the Ribeye with mashed potatoes and was glad I did!!!!! It was medium rare exactly like I like it! It was tender and flavorful, didn't use a drop of A1. Mashed potatoes were delicious with it. My father ordered the steak Diane, medium rare, and he loved it. The fried shrimp platter my daughter ordered was huge, she also enjoyed it. The Cole slaw was honestly one of the best I've had. Yes, I know it's just Coke slaw but I'm a bit of a slaw snob. The little sliders were good and my aunt ordered the steak tacos which she enjoyed with the rice and beans.  The waiter was a sweet heart and brought my father out a scoop of ice cream with a candle, joked and said his gift is to NOT sing him happy birthday. He must have the angelic voice I have ;)  All in all it was a great experience. Loved sitting outside on Las Olas. They lost a star due to the rude host in the front. They should realize that the first person you interact with sets the tone for the whole experience.

Tracey S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",226,29,10,2.0,8/7/2017,"So let me start with we come here very often because it's my sisters favorite spot and she gets the same thing every time she comes in and at every location because maybe 2 years ago, a server told her to order it that way. The last two times we went to this location before this experience Shane was our server and he was so great and accommodating as always.  My family and I came in Friday as soon as they opened. Christopher was our server this time, at least that was the name on the server check. My sister ordered a side of angel hair pasta and added the scampi sauce... same thing she orders everyyyy time. He goes ""mm no"" we don't do that and tries to point her to the 20$ dish with mushrooms AND shrimp.... ""No"" is something you should never say to a guest.. Anyway, my sister can't eat shellfish and she hates mushrooms why would you recommend that after being told there's an allergy.  We very very politely let the Chris know that the way that we asked for it has always been accommodated and if anything at all they added an upcharge for the sauce. He double checked with the kitchen manager to see what he could do and he came back to the table and actually told us ""yea my kitchen manager said he won't do that at all actually"".. hmmmm... really? Either they have a brand new kitchen manager then or the server never actually asked. We literally ordered the same exact dish 3 weeks ago for my birthday!! I cannot get over that he actually told us they won't make what she has gotten every single time we have come in. She ended up choosing something totally different. The service aside from that was great, as far as the food coming out and drink refills and what not but the hospitality part and accommodating the guest totally lacked. Awkward lunch for us, and she's the only reason we go there  because she likes that dish.

Malia R.,"Dallas, TX",497,673,1405,1.0,8/21/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my top 10 fave restaurants. I feel weird even giving one a 1 star review. Tons to choose from, generous portions, reasonable prices, all that cheesecake? How can one not love the place? Fort Lauderdale's location has proven to me that all Cheesecake Factory's are not created equal. On the way there, I call to ask the best place to park, since we are unfamiliar with the area. The woman gives me an address of a place that when we get to, is $10 to park and super far from the restaurant! So we continue driving and find a place on our own, literally across the street for only $5. When we get in, they tell us 30 minute wait..but it ended up being 50 minutes. When the hostess walks us to patio table 238, it's dirty. It looked like the previous party had just left seconds ago! Food plates still there, drinks, yeah. So she tells us to wait and she was going to find someone to clean it. We literally awkwardly stood there by other peoples tables for what seemed like forever. Other servers, bartenders just walked passed us continuously and never said a word. Then I saw what looked like a manager headed our way so I assumed he would take charge. NOPE! It was as if we were invisible. He walked right past us! Of course I chased him down and asked him to fix this already horrible situation and he cleaned it up without ever saying a word to us. We sat and our server Julia D. decided to make an appearance approximately 10 minutes later. We placed our drink order and as she left our table, the next table over flagged her down and asked for something that they had ordered and not gotten. Her response, ""I'm not your server."" Not even an offer to locate their server. We are contemplating leaving at this point, but we make the mistake of staying.  As I'm looking through the menu, stray cats decided to join us. We sat outside, which was a nice setting until we saw the 4 or 5 cats chillin' just outside the restaurant patio door behind the drink station/bar area. And one who looked like he was contemplating jumping on our table. Now I'm an animal lover, but I can't imagine how unsanitary this is.  We finally get our drinks and they're just okay. The Asian pear martini is super sweet! Not my preference. She takes our food order and it literally took an hour to get it. She never checked up on us that entire time, I had to flag her down to request more bread and drink refills for my daughter. I also decided to ask her if I can speak with the manager and she says she will get him. Guess what? He never came!! Our food comes and it's delicious..but everything else was insanely horrible.

Gregory D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,16,,1.0,4/19/2017,"This may well have been the worst restaurant experience ever.  My partner and I craved the Cheesecake Factory catfish dinner that we so enjoyed when visiting relatives in Atlanta.  We took a booth in the bar and relayed to the waitress that we were there for the catfish.  She opened the menu and pointed it out.  When we told her how much we liked it in Atlanta, the fun began.  She stated that fish are like women, no two are the same.  She then suggested that we wouldn't know about that.  We thought it was an odd crack, but laughed it off.  When she brought the drinks, we ordered the fish and several appetizers.  A few minutes later, she glided by slapping a menu on the table saying, ""No fish.""  I asked my partner if I imagined that or if she was joking.  When we summoned her back, we learned that they were indeed out of the product we came to enjoy.  It was after all after 5:00PM.  Our server should not have shown surprise when we told her be bring the check for the drinks.  She did so and was quite proud that she was able to remove the appetizers we had not yet received.  Then we waited.  And we waited.  It was as if the staff was having its daily briefing out back. Perhaps that was the time they were learning of outages.  I eventually tried to settle the bill at the bar, but the bar back was solo.  Spotting the host who was not busy, I asked if he could help.  He smugly remarked that he was not a server but took the folio and my card.  As he pranced back and forth, I put out my hand and asked for the folio as I then preferred to handle the bill at the bar when the staff reappeared.  Then we got the coup de grace.  The host took a defensive stance and barked, ""Don't you touch me.""  It was clear to me at that point that I had somehow inadvertently landed in Nutsville, and immediately gave him space.  A delightful young lady then took the folio from him and I settled the bill.  Then we got the hell out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=80

We chose this CCF because the East Las Olas ambience has its unique invigorating casual, but upscale, atmosphere. Their menu is varied from burgers and sandwiches, to fine pastas, seafood and steaks; and, their dinners are very good. We always check out the CCF specialty cheese cakes first, with the foreknowledge that the overall plan is to finish with a great dessert. Inside is restaurant-typical well appointed yesteryear-ish motif. Outside dining on Las Olas is a little noisy, but connects you to the area visitors. The tables on the side street aren't as noisy, and is a little more laid back.

Wade M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",137,186,3,2.0,10/15/2014,"INCONSISTENT - OVERWHELMING MENU - STICKY FLOOR - DUSTY NAPKINS. I live a few blocks away, so my daughter and I have been going to Cheesecake a few times a month for 5 years. We've seen employees come and go. This is my first review. They're doing something right because they're generally full. I don't like the giant menu personally. I'd prefer a few dished from the land, the air, and the sea. I leave it to the chef to pick which ones will delight me most. The service is generally friendly and efficient enough, but they have too-frequent lapses. This week, we arrived to an empty restaurant at 7pm, and still hadn't been served at 8. We left. That's bad service on any planet. I have 2 pet peeves I've entered in the Anything else part of their surveys. 1) The floor is disgusting. It feels like it has a thin coat of Crisco on it. Maybe that's fun for the 10-year-olds pretending to ice skate around, but to me it makes the restaurant seem filthy. 2) The napkins leave my lap covered with white napkin dust. When I remember, I ask for a black napkin, but we put a man on the moon, traveled twice the speed of sound, and correct near blindness with disposable contacts. Do you think you could pick a fabric that I can use to wipe my mouth without shedding napkin dust all over my lap? The food is good enough. The portions are generous. Period. I think I've tried about everything, and nothing is really unique and special, and if there is, it can't be found on the overwhelming menu. I'm not a big dessert eater, so I'm not seduced by the case of delicious-looking cheesecakes (maybe once a year). If you are, you should definitely not go here. The momentary pleasure of a pound of cheesecake doesn't offset the discomfort and long term penalty.

Jo W.,"Miami, FL",176,335,1441,4.0,9/24/2012,"I like discovering new places but one of the few chain restaurants I actually like going to is The Cheesecake Factory. If you think of chain restaurants a few probably pop up in your mind, but Cheesecake Factory is at the pinnacle in this genre of restaurants. Once you step inside The Cheesecake Factory, you almost forget that this is a chain. The feel of the restaurant is similar to that of a fine dining establish but is obviously at an affordable price. What I love most about The Cheesecake Factory is the staff. If you have even been and I am pretty sure you have, Cheesecake Factory has this huge book that they call a menu. No matter what location I have been to, I swear all the servers know the menu inside and out, and if you can study and remember their menu, you earn my respect. Everyone, from the hosts to the servers, is upbeat and friendly. One of the perks of The Cheesecake Factory is the complimentary bread. You are usually given a sourdough loaf and a wheat loaf. I am not a fan of the sourdough and usually requested just wheat bread. The wheat bread is not what you would typical expect wheat bread to taste like. It is really good when it is fresh out of the oven. My favorite dish at Cheesecake Factory is the Jambalaya Pasta. I'm a spicy addict, so I usually at lots of crushed red pepper to it but even without that, it is delicious. My other favorite is the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club. This sandwich is good as you know what, but it is also one of the more fattening things on their menu, so whenever I get it I usually only eat half and share, but trust me it is really really good. Another one of my staples is the Strawberry Lemonade. It is definitely good but can be a little too sweet at times. They also have really good cocktails here so while most people come for the cheesecake and the food, you really have to consider trying one of their cocktails.   I wanted to try something new and a little bit healthier, so I decided to get the Ahi Tartare. Although it was among the small plates, considering the large portions at Cheesecake Factory, I thought it would be bigger. It was pretty small but very good. The tuna and avocado were fresh and the Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce was the perfect complement to the tartare. My only complaint was that I wish it came with more tortilla chips. I was trying to be conservative with my calories this time, but I do recommend the Godiva Chocolate, Oreo Extreme and the Adams Peanut Butter Cup cheesecakes. I am a chocolate and sweets addictive so if you are not into that, these choices are definitely not for you. I am pretty sure everyone has been to a Cheesecake Factory at some point in their life, so my only suggestion would be to experiment.

This past experience is most likely the worst.   We arrived and were seated relatively quickly, which was completely misleading.  We sat down and no one came to our table for at least 5+ minutes, which when you are on a time crunch for lunch, every minute counts.  We asked another server to send someone over, when our server arrived she was frazzled, and asked for our drink order.  I asked for a small cup of juice for the baby- this was the only item that came quickly- but it was very watered down.  We had to ask for bread several times.  It took another 5 minutes for her to come back with hot tea selections.  We ordered immediately, and then waited, and waited, and waited- the whole lunch hour gone, and no food.  We complained, the manager came over - and apologized.  When our meals finally arrived we had to eat very quickly.  We asked why so long, and were told that there were many new menu items, which were overloading the kitchen.  I would have given this warrant except this is not the first time that the service has been extremely slow during lunch.   The manager seemed to know how upset we were, and comped part of the meal.  A very nice gesture- I think that we will stick to coming here only for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=140

For the most part everything else is your typical Cheesecake Factory except for the service which seem to be better than most.  Anyone who has been to any cheesecake will tell you they are known for their extensive menu and large take home portion.  Not saying the ladder is a bad thing.  Sometime the size of the menu may prove to be challenging and forget it if you are indecisive you will never order lol. But in all seriousness the food is always good with one of my favorites being the meatloaf.  You can't say you been to the factory and not ordered a cheese cake or giant slice of cake.  My all time favorite cheese cake is the Dutch Caramel Apple cheesecake.  It's like eating an apple pie and a slice of plain cheesecake at the same time.  Must give it a try!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=160

I am giving 4/5 stars because of the other servers who were gathered by the side station in the bar nearest to the patio entrance/exit.

I told the waitress that this wan't the one I ordered and even specified that it was the one served in the cast iron pan, topped with bread crumbs. Next thing you know, they brought back what I thought was my side and then discovered that they simply poured the 1st mac 'n cheese into the right cast-iron bowl and drizzled it with shredded cheese.

Stephen O.,"Austin, TX",281,111,194,4.0,5/11/2011,"Wow, there are a lot of people giving this place a hard time.  I'll start with what we didn't like and work backwards -- so once the sun went down the lights inside were much too dim, we didn't say anything but we heard the table next to us offering the same complaint.  Apparently the lights are on some sort of timer and couldn't (or wouldn't?) be adjusted.  We also noticed a couple right outside our window who got their main dishes before we had our salads, but there were 4 in our party, so maybe it was a fluke. My last complaint is not about the taste of the food (it was all excellent), just about its delivery. I ordered the combination salmon and shrimp scampi and replaced my side of mashed potatoes with a salad. Like I mentioned earlier, the other couple's meal came before my salad, which was served with my main dish.  Maybe I should have specified that I wanted it sooner than that, but having worked in a restaurant I thought that was pretty standard procedure.  Also, when I got my entree, i was shocked to see that there was no pasta with my shrimp scampi.  Apparently the combination plates aren't served the same as the full entree listed directly above the combination options BUT once I asked her about the discrepancy she immediately brought me a bowl of pasta for the shrimp, great service. That all being said, our server, Sarah, was fantastic.  She didn't bat an eye at my complaint or any of our requests (and  there were several, such as wrapping up the bread).  She stayed pleasant and smiling throughout.  She was chatty when it was appropriate and let us be when it was time.  The food, both the entree and the desserts (see the pictures) were delicious. The bottom line: you know what price to expect, the service was the best we had on our vacation, the food was delicious, and it was only the small details we missed on.  Most reasonable people can overlook those types of things. 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=180

Let me first say that the burger was HUGE and the meat was excellent quality. I ordered medium rare and they had no problem serving me it, says something about the beef they buy. The Fettucini was the lunch size portion, plenty large and no need to order the dinner portion. Total satisfied with the taste and texture. For dessert we ordered the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake and the new OREO® Dream Extreme Cheesecake, both excellent as expected. Ultimately after ordering 2 non alcoholic beverages, 2 appetizers, 2 mains and 2 desserts, the bill was a WHOPPING $63 bucks!! Very reasonable indeed.. I was totally surprised, expected to pay near $85 bucks. Definitely going to make this a regular thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=180

Amanda T.,"Pompano Beach, FL",3,4,,5.0,2/10/2015,"Finally getting time to write this review! Went for dinner with my girlfriend on the 31st of January. The 5 stars rating is solely based off of the waiter who wasn't even assigned to our section, but took care of us!  Confused, let me explain..  We got walked to a booth..second one straight down on the right side of the podium. Sat down and looked at menus and chit chatted...after about 15mins..15..one-five.. i got agitated and stopped a waiter and being annoyed already, I asked "" do we get a server with this table or is it self serve?! We've been waiting for like 15 mins and no one has even introduced themselves.""  He IMMEDIATELY apologizes for the lack of service and, instead of just saying I'll go find her, WHIPS out his notepad and takes our drink AND food orders ( like i said we were sitting there long enough to look through the entire menu uninterrupted!) For me, this is a huge deal because he had enough patience and understanding to defuse the situation, saving the restaurant some money.  We noticed his section was on the other side and he was also completely filled but yet still put in our drink and food order. This SUPERMAN CAPE WEARING SOB'S name was PETER!!! :) Now, lets introduce the other character in this awesome adventure. After another 5mins from Peter taking our order a waitress walks up irritated and introduces herself, Bonqeasha. I shit you not, that was her name, **no pun intended and may have messed up the spelling**.  We politely tell her that another waiter took care of our drink order and food order. She clapped her hands together, said ""OK"" and walked away. Moments later walks back and drops off our drinks without saying a word... Summarizing this..after our food gets dropped off by food runners ( Also amazingly nice and polite) we get another follow up visit from Mr. peter asking if everything is ok and if the food and drink is to our liking. (IT MOST DEFINITELY WAS! Thank you to the chefs that night!!!)  Not once did Bonqeasha check on us. We finally had to call her over for the check. Needless to say PETER got the tip that night...so humble HAD TO FORCE HIM TO TAKE IT!! .but to Bonquesha I'll leave this tip.. a smile and tentativeness is where the money is in this industry. I never leave reviews, but this one had to be shared. Faith in humanity was almost lost..till Peter showed up! Will def come back again!

Serena N.,"Orlando, FL",6,3,,2.0,8/19/2015,"By far the worst Cheesecake Factory location I have been to. We were a party of 16 but waited nearly 3 hours for a table...they were busy but certainly not busy enough to warrant that long of a wait time and probably sat 50+ (likely more) people that came in after us. Girls at the hostess station were fairly snobby and certainly less than polite and kept telling us 20 more minutes every 20 minutes. The floors were gross and slimy and, wearing sandals, I almost busted my butt on the way to and from the bathroom, which was disgusting. Most stalls were without toilet paper a few were extra gross, to the point of being unusable. For the price of the menu items, the experience at this particular location was certainly not worth it. Had a large group of my coworkers not been there to celebrate 2 birthdays, I would not have stayed. One star for the salted caramel cheesecake and the other for our waitress, who was friendly enough. Everyone's order was correct, came out in a reasonable amount of time and we got no grief about needing some separate checks, though she did know we were waiting forever and pissed. The manager did come over after we had paid already to offer free desserts to the birthday girls. However, it was too little too late and we really just wanted to get the heck out of there.

LoveFood I.,"Clifton, NJ",0,11,,1.0,7/25/2015,I like Cheesecake Factory up North and I was in Florida for business and decided to stop in and enjoy some of my favorite pasta and salad while sitting outdoors. As I took the first bite from my salad something caught my eye! What we refer to as cockroaches up North but apparently has another name in Florida. I quickly put up my feet and flagged the waitress over who was very kind and called over the manager who politely offered seating inside and assured me there is none inside and when it rains it's normal for these giant roaches to surface. They seated me inside but after seeing 2 large ones outside I had already lost my appetite. Paid 35 for a meal I took couple bites from and left starving. I guess this is normal for Fort Lauderdale locals but up North seeing giant roaches especially at the restaurant you are eating is not acceptable!

Raul H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,9,,1.0,7/26/2014,"I had heard many good things about the Cheesecake Factory and I finally decided to try it with my partner. We each ordered different things. I had steak and shrimps and she had chicken alfredo. The first thing when we saw our food we were both thinking something similar: Is this it? Everything our friends and family talked about the Cheesecake Factory, big portions would always pop up in a conversation. The plates were huge, but the portion of the food was rather small. Perhaps what annoyed me the most was not the portion size, but the lack of serving the items that were highlighted by the menu. I only got three small shrimps and 6 tiny pieces of steak. My partner received pasta and alfredo, but where was the chicken? Four small pieces of chicken was all that we counted. The prices for the items were $16 and $20. I think that is way too overpriced, being that the Cheesecake Factory is not a four or five star restaurant. The food was decent. There was some taste to the alfredo, but nothing made it stand out. Steak Diane had no special flavor and the shrimp...too much lemon. I won't be going back to the Cheesecake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=260

Caro P.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,1.0,3/28/2015,"After a delightful  Sarah McLachlan concert, we  decided to walk down Las olas and have a late dinner. Naturally  there wasn't much open so we decided to eat at cheesecake for a safe, reliable  meal. Wow,  were  we mistaken. First the hostess told us we would be seated immediately  only to then say nope sorry, we're cleaning  the section  you will have to wait. So we said no big deal, can we sit at the bar and she said  sure. We walked over, grabbed  a table and a waitress  asked, ""is it just the 4 of you?"" And that was the last time anyone  spoke to us. After at least 10 minutes of waiting without  any water, utensils or menus I decided to get up and talk to the hostess. Another  waste of time as she completely  ignored me for 5 minutes. So my next step was ask a bus boy for the manager, Yea that took another 5-10 minutes. Although the manager was apolgetic, he did make excuses for his team, which, in my book, is a big no no. I wasn't rude, mean or angry so no need for excuses, just apologize  & make it up to the customer.  Needless to say, we left.

When we asked how much longer, we didn't really get an answer. They simply told us that they were waiting for the party before us to get up and leave the table. So... if they decided to stay at the table for another hour, we would have to wait that long??? And is that the only table in the entire restaurant??? When we were finally seated after about an hour of waiting. I requested bread right away for the kids who were starving. Apparently the waitress thought I was being a little demanding because her attitude with me for the rest of the meal was not the best.

Katie W.,"Miami, FL",46,115,68,2.0,12/16/2012,"NO NO NO NO NO I WILL NOT EAT AT A CHEESECAKE FACTORY AGAIN. I don't see why people actually like this place. I know Grand Lux is owned by the same people, but Grand Lux is far superior to Cheesecake Factory. First, the menu at Cheesecake Factory just seems contradictory to me. Its a big menu, and yet I feel like the selection sucks. It can be a bit overwhelming. Grand Lux has a large menu as well, but they have much more variation and they have more unique dishes. Second, the food is just sooooooooooo mediocre. Everytime I've eaten there it's been extremely underwhelming. I don't go often at all. The last time I went was a couple weekes ago, and the last time before that must have been 10 years ago, but I always remember never really enjoying it at all. Last time I got the Cali Cheesesteak sandwich and I have to say I can make a better one from the frozen cheesesteak kit at Publix. It wasn't inedible, it was just so meh. The flavor wasn't there at all. It just tasted like unseasoned meat with some melted cheese and peppers. It wasn't indulgent in the slightest bit. I know it's just a Cheesecake Factory and they're not known for their outrageous food, it's just that it's so overpriced for mediocre flavorless food. If I want to get a quick bite to eat at an average place, I don't mind paying a few bucks, but TCF is overpriced for what they give you. The only reason they have 2 stars and not 1 is because their cheesecakes are pretty damn tasty and they make a decent cocktail, thats it. All in all, I would never ever take a friend to The Cheesecake Factory, I'd much rather go to Grand Lux and get a nice sangria, a burger melt and some delicious fried pickles on the side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=260

I started my ""20 minute"" wait and was able to speak with several folks that had been there over an hour that was told 40 minutes.  At this point, I just settled in for an hour wait.  I mean it's Christmas Eve at 8:00PM, what else are you going to do?!? We were finally seated after about 40 minutes and service was slow.  The wait staff seemed to be short and things weren't coming from the kitchen fast enough.  Most all the tables were frustrated with service from refills on drinks to bread and everything in between. The food (after a 30 minuted wait) was hot and tasted fresh but wasn't worth a 30 minute wait. The atmosphere seemed like most other Cheesecake Factory locations except this place was dirty.  Floors needed a good scrubbing and I am hoping that it was because of the short staff issue.   The menu is totally outrageous.  There are way too many items to read about before making settling on a dish.  It really takes a lot of time to read all the options and decide on something.  I would recommend deciding if you want fish, meat or poultry and then go to those pages and reading those items. Would I come back??  Probably, if it were Christmas Eve and the only thing open!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=200

Shandi B.,"Davie, FL",70,218,133,4.0,1/23/2012,"I might be in the minority, but I love The Cheesecake Factory, especially this location.  I most recently went on a Friday night at 8pm - and there was only a 15 minute wait.  At the Sawgrass or Pembroke Gardens locations, no doubt the wait would have been that plus an hour. As if their menu wasn't big enough, they have also added a couple of new menu types, including small plates and a skinnylicious menu.  It's pretty annoying to have to order the ""skinnylicious grilled chicken"", but it's really good so it's worth the awkward moment.  Last time I opted for the shredded chicken lettuce wraps, which were a really good bargain (three huge and already assembled lettuce wraps for $5). Also, my favorite dessert here is not cheesecake - but strawberry shortcake.  Buttery shortcake, super sweet strawberries, ice cream and their killer whipped cream.  I could just eat that and their sourdough bread and be super happy (albeit super fatty, which is why I don't, haha). Oh oh oh and I almost forgot to mention, last time I went I had to sit in the long bench booth, and next to our table for four was a table for two - except these two were sooooo in love that they just HAD to both sit on the booth side. It looked so uncomfortable, and the waiters had no clue what to do with their dinner plates, since two people don't fit so well on booth side meant for one.  Hilar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=200

However the CF down here gives me the idea that many folks in FLL don't like chain restaurants. I say that because as I was walking to the restaurant not many people were in or outside on the patio here, many of the neighboring restaurants were full of people sitting outside and vice versa. When we came in there was only one hostess which was another sign because again thats not what I'm accustomed to when going to a CF in Atlanta.  When greeted and seated, our server was nice and attentive, the bread was hard and cold, either Florida folks don't like carbs or their baker at the restaurant was having a bad day. Wasn't too hungry so I ordered some pretzel chicken sticks off the small menu and my friend had the Orange chicken entree.

Even with the cooking error, we were very pleased with our late lunch experience and we were super stuffed.

The only negatives I have are: I was pretty much forced to sit in the Bar area after I clearly expressed I wanted a booth in the Main Dinning Room, The wait would have been much longer if I was not right up in the hostess face, and I really had a problem with the fact that they sit the silverware/eating utensils right on the table. I don't like that, I don't know what they sprayed and sometimes they use those rags over and over again, so that was a real turn off for me, I had to end up using ToGo utensils. All in all I would definitely recommend this location to Family and Friends and most likely would be returning. Note: Combination Shrimp Scampi does not come with Pasta, a bit to rich but still very delicious but it only come with large portion size shrimp and sauce.  Hope this helps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=240
Sara M.,"Washington, DC",512,357,36,4.0,4/4/2012,"I love Cheesecake Factory! I wonder if their pumpernickel break contains a dose or two of crack.. that's not an accusation.. I'm just wondering is all. I am not going to go deep into content on the Cheesecake factory because all I need to say is that I love their food and the menu is super extensive. The cheesecakes will make you cum. Now, with all of that said, I am knocking down a star at this particular location for two reasons. The first is that their floor is an ice rink. Seriously, do they coat their tiles in vasaline? Baby oil maybe? Whatever the case may be, one step on their tile and you're saying ""holy sh*t I am going to bust my ass!"" And you know what, I am just not a fan of busting my ass, especially if I am sober. Ok CCF? invest in some sandpaper and tape it to the bottom of your wait staff's shoes, that will easily solve the issue. You can thank me later. The second reason for CCF not getting all 5 stars is that the waiter I had last Saturday night was a real douche.

Pat S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,25,15,4.0,4/9/2015,"I'd never been to a Cheesecake before even though I'd heard a ton about it and most everyone I know has been. So we decided to check it out early evening one weeknight recently. Yikes!! I had no idea it would be a mad house on a weeknight and have over an hour wait!! The front desk had young women standing there looking unconcerned and unhelpful. They didn't address us when we walked in, there was a large crowd standing around and I had no idea who was in line, who was waiting, etc. We walked up to the desk and no one looked at us or acknowledged us. ""Hello??"" Finally they looked up silently. ""We need a table?"" She said it would be at least an hour wait. Wow. So because we had driven downtown JUST to eat here we didn't want to make the 45min drive back home so we decided to just wait it out. I ended up going across the street to get a small bite at a dessert shop to tie me over. Once we were seated I started feeling really sick. It might have been the rich dessert bite I had on an empty stomach, but unfortunately by the time our appetizer came I was about ready to pass out. I asked our waiter if we could have our food boxed to go. He was concerned and wanted to make sure we weren't upset over the service. I told him while it was a long wait to get seated and a long wait to get food, we weren't upset over that I simply wasn't feeling great and we were only leaving due to that. He apologized even though he didn't do anything wrong and when he brought our boxed food back out he'd included a free piece of cheesecake ""for your trouble."" Which was VERY nice of him and I thought it was above and beyond customer service. So I'm giving 4 stars due to the great kindness and customer service of our waiter, and leaving off one star due to the unhelpful front desk ladies and the long wait. Thanks to our waiter for going above and beyond!

It was a party of 7 and I'm not exaggerating when I say all of my friends and I got sick; my one friend threw up while he was there because his burger wasn't cooked right!  I ordered a supreme pizza, first off, I never thought anyone could mess up pizza but my god-- my toppings were falling off because it was under cooked! The middle was still doughy and the slices weren't even cut properly. Another friend ordered the four cheese pasta and it came out cold and sweet/sour. Also wouldn't recommend getting the the steak tacos or chicken enchilada, both of my friends resulted in stomach problems that carried onto the night and the next day.  Furthermore, the service- I get it, we were a big group, but our waitress wasn't having it with us last night. Hardly ever came around to refill our drinks, my friend requested a sauce and it didn't come out until after she was almost done with her food and was brought out by ANOTHER waiter, I personally also asked for hot sauce and she flat out ignored me and another waitress grabbed hot sauce for me instead. She also charged my friends and I wrong for some items but we're so fed up we just decided to leave.

The only problem again was customer service. Our server Timothy forgot about drink we have ordered and overall was not really attentive, at the end when he gave us a check he took it right away and opened to see how much tips we left him, I'm sorry it was a little bit awkward, I've worked in the restaurants before and it was a big no no to take signed check from people while they still there and especially to check the tips.

First of all, it took at least five minutes until someone took the time to acknowledge us and we did not even know this person was our server until later. Not friendly, had to ask what the soup was, and seemed annoyed to be working. After we ordered we had to flag him down again for bread because it was not brought out like usual. During this time, tables around us were beginning to get up. The restaurant was only about half full but there seemed to be dirty tables everywhere with no one to clean them. Once our food came, instead of being brought a new iced tea - mine was taken from me and was gone for at least thee minutes. Took a long time to clear the plates when we were finished and also a long time to get our check and close out. During all this time the dirty tables kept adding up and we felt gross being among so much mess. We finally were able to leave and left the restaurant without a goodbye from any staff member. We saw many on their phones, could've been better used cleaning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=40

Not wrapped in a napkin. Are you kidding me? That's so unsanitary. When we asked about it, her answer was that all the locations do that and it's to save time on wrapping them in napkins. I know that's bs. Even tho as we left, we noticed the silverware on the outside tables were wrapped in napkins. They also dim the lights too dark to the point where people were using flashlights to look at the menus. Free Bread was cold and hard, but the only positive was that our food was good.

Ordered chicken Quesadilla, which was very rich. It was full of melted cheese and delicious with guacamole, sour cream and a salad. And one of their specialty - Eggplant Parmesan- that one was unusual. Looked like a meatloaf covered with cheese, marinara and pasta. The eggplants were cut and breaded, coated with different cheese and marinara sauce. It was served with delicate pesto pasta.  Quite a substantial and nourishing dish.  Being in this place we of course ordered a cheesecake for dessert. This time it was their signature Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake. Two in one I'd say. Very moisture, creamy and yummy. A great mix of red velvet cake and a cheesecake.  The service was slow, but we weren't in a hurry.

Katherine S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,15,3,1.0,4/2/2016,"I decided to try this Cheesecake Factory again. It was a weeknight around 6:30pm- about 68 degrees outside. My boyfriend and I walked up with our dog and I walked inside to ask for a table outside since we had the dog with us. The hostess stared at me with a blank look, then turned around and yelled at one of the servers to ask if he was working tables outside (keep in mind they have two separate porches WITH heaters by the tables). The server said no. The hostess looked around for a second and then told me, ""sorry, we're not seating anyone outside because it's so cold and nobody is waiting tables out there."" I was speechless. What? You're turning down customers because the 68 degree weather is too cold? My boyfriend and I usually get entrees, an appetizer, and a couple of drinks. So there goes at least $80.  I went outside to tell my boyfriend and we both noticed a table outside where a group of 4 people were being served. My boyfriend went in and tried to tell the hostess but she still refused to seat us since it was *so* cold. So we left and ate at American Social, which is phenomenal by the way.

To start with, the never-ending free wheat bread is so delicious. The well drinks, some wines and beer are half off in the bar area, and so are some of their appetizers. My boyfriend has gotten the tamale cakes twice and has devoured them.  And you get three cakes for $5-6?! What a deal. He's also ordered the spinach and cheese dip, which was also sinfully decadent. I loved the fish and chips I ordered. The fish was perfectly flaky and flavorful and the outside batter was a great combination of soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. And the fries are always fresh, hot and well seasoned.  I once ordered the vietnamese tacos, and I will never do that again. The buns were so fluffy and nice, but the marinated cucumber and carrot slaw was just badly sauced. The sauce was a horrible flavor so then it just killed the entire dish. On separate occassions I have also ordered the turkey club. It's one of my favorite sandwiches. I substitute the bread for wheat bread and usually take off one slice of the bread because three slices of bread is too much for me. So coming here, you just have to be careful what you order, come at a time the prices are right, and come when it's the least busiest because then the service gets worse and the place gets loud.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=220

(the pastas) Overpriced.. The place smelt like humid dishwasher (no lies here) The tables were jam packed together which made me feel they rather see profit then provide comfortability.. ..we were at a booth and i could have asked the table next to us for salt.. Fridays and Saturdays the wait is always 30-45 on usual.. no exceptions So after my 5 years of restaurant experience,and ive done it all from busing to waiting, my conclusion is, a C.

If you've visited any location even once, you know exactly what to expect at TCF - long waits, fairly loud atmosphere, above average service, okay to very good tasting food and large portions.  This was my spot for dessert and coffee after an evening of putzing around on Las Olas. An abundance of outdoor seating and their namesake specialty made it a natural choice. We were seated outside almost directly above the Henry Kinney Tunnel (which also runs below the river) but you'd never know it.  At the time, Red Velvet cheesecake had just made its debut. This happened to coincide with the height of my obsession with all things red and velvety. I didn't have to look further than the back of the menu. Once my towering confection arrived, a sassy diner at an adjacent table verbally eyed it up. I offered her one of my two spare forks. She gladly obliged and we did a little duet using only the word ""mmm."" Wait, why did I have three forks? I know the slices are big, but I only have two hands.

Waitress was helpful the entire time and checked up on us frequently and recommened almost everything we had.  The Mai Tai drink , though 10 bucks, was EXCELLENT.  Not the strongest I've had, but it was very tasty and FRESH.  The appetizers were great . . . these 6 crab balls on a small plate and the Chicken Pot Stickers.  Presented nicely and great tasting. The Grilled Herb Catfish was HUGE and lived up to the taste I envisioned.  The wife had a grilled Salmon and Scampi combo, which was only ok for here . . . she said the shrimp were overcooked and the Salmon IMO was too herby.  The grilled Aspargus could have been more tender.   The Iced Teas aren't sweet here, so watch for that before ordering if it bothers you. We had the Cheesecakes to go . . . and wow, definitely lives up to the billing.  White Chocolate Macadamian and a Ultimate Red Velvet . . . do yourself a favor and try those 2 . . . the best I have had here.

So we decided to let them see what its all about.  I ordered my usual-chicken and biscuits.  I was ecstatic beyond words because the location in Long Island, NY took it off their menu!! We kept it non-alcoholic since this was our last stop before the airport. The crew had sodas w free refills, and the waitress was so awesome, the glasses were never fully empty each time she took them away & bought us fresh ones. My friend ordered a fried mac & cheese burger, which looked quite interesting. It was a burger w a layer of cheese & a ball of fried mac & cheese on top. If your a burger & cheese lover, this is for you. If not, it might be a cheese overdose & you may end up in the bathroom!! Cheesecake of choice- this time was the dulce de leche.  It was just as delicious & wonderful as all the others Ive had, but tiramisu cheesecake is still my fave, hands down!! Service was excellent. Waitress was great at making recommndations. She told me chicken  & biscuits was her fave as well. She then went on to say that during her first 2 weeks of training, they made the new wait staff taste practically everything on the menu so they can really know the menu when they are assisting customers.  I thought this was insane, but cool. Makes me wanna just apply so I can get ""training!"" Lol!! I would definitely return if Im hanging around Ft. Lauderdale & craving chicken & biscuits or a mean cheesecake.

Grant C.,"New York, NY",95,446,205,1.0,2/25/2011,"Why am I reviewing a Cheesecake Factory, you may ask?  God help me, it was the only thing still open by the time my flight got in and I was famished.  I came in with low expectations, but they failed to even meet those. Mostly because they tried to kick me out.  I came in just before closing, but most of the restaurant was full and they were still taking orders at the tables.  Weary business traveler, I sat at the bar and received this warm and friendly greeting: ""Let me see if we're still taking orders."" Then the manager came over to interrogate me: Manager  -- ""How did you get here? Yelper  -- ""I walked through the front door."" Manager  -- ""After closing?"" Yelper  -- ""I don't know what time you close, but the door was open."" Manager  -- ""Well where were you?  Were you in the bathroom?"" Yelper -- ""Nope.  Walked from the door to this barstool."" Manager -- ""Well, you can order something for takeout."" Yelper -- ""Um, no.  I'm going to drink a beer and eat here."" WTF?!?  I know when I'm not wanted and would have walked the fuck out if I wasn't so damn hungry.  I'm not sure who in corporate headquarters trained this manager to turn away paying customers, but she did a great job of making sure I won't return. Oh, the food?  It was the sort of bland, processed TGI Applebee's Chili's Factory Bennigan's meal I expected from a chain, but surprisingly overpriced.  I'm packing a lunchbox from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=220

MickeyBlue I.,"Hollywood, FL",225,672,3129,4.0,1/26/2013,"I love this strip! A few restaurants are on the pricey side,but that's great to keep the undesirables away. This particular night we sat outside and had a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and coffee. Perfect dessert while we people watched, I'm not sure why people go running along the sidewalks where people are supposed to ""walk"" but it's full of pyscho runners so don't be surprised to see a marathon on a sat night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=220
Louis R.,"Plantation, FL",11,18,31,1.0,9/12/2009,"First, beware you will not know until you get there if they just cleaned the floors or the vents the night before.  I have now been there twice in the past few months and both times happened to be after a cleaning.  It smelled like bleach and was terrible.  This last time I was with my family and there were too many of us to leave so we thought we would give it another try.  Four of us ordered the sangria---if you want a shot of sangria for $10 then this is for you.  When we ordered a second drink ""with no ice"" the waiter brought back a 1/2 a glass.  When we asked for the manager, he replied this is they way we do it.  Would you like it 1/2 or not at all.  I also ordered the fish taco---the fish was as dry as can be and tasteless.  Yes, this was not a great visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=280
Erika K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,2.0,4/23/2014,"My boyfriend and I arrived tonight to enjoy some dessert after our dinner. Our server Jamar was very sweet and this review does not reflect him at all. The hostess lead us through the restaurant, which was a disaster. I have honestly never seen a restaurant so messy. If I was to guess, at least half the entire restaurant was unable to be sat, because the tables were cluttered with dishes. We arrived on the outdoor patio which was in the same terrible state. When we sat, there were 12 dirty tables and as I'm walking out now there are still 8. Not only did the hostess and servers allow the restaurant to be so unkept, but I watched one, maybe even two managers come out on the patio and leave without a glass in their hand. I work in the restaurant industry and have for many years and it takes a lot to actually push me to write this review. This clearly shows lack of management and made our experience here un enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=280
Michael C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,52,2,2.0,11/22/2010,"Well we all know the name...but I dont see what the hype is about..there is ALWAYS a wait....and no matter what you order..the service takes forever. I feel the drink prices are quite high compared to other places. I will say the cheesecake is quite good, but they better get that right. Overall it's not good  it's not bad..it's okay if you have extra time and money to waste",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=280

Kameelah R.,"San Francisco, CA",104,150,9,2.0,6/15/2008,Why I ate here after a such a bad time in the Grove is a mystery. The menu is huge and yet you cant make a single substitution.

Justin R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,14,1,1.0,12/4/2010,"I recently found myself on Las Olas on a Saturday and hungry.  I was near the Cheesecake Factory and decided to have an early dinner.  It was a little after 2PM.  The restaurant was almost empty.  I was seated promptly by the hostess.  Now, I think that when you go to a restaurant you try to have a total enjoyable experience. The hostess seated me near the POS computer in front of the door to the patio that opened and closed frequently and was very annoying.  I ordered the chicken Madeira, a dish I have often ordered.  I had 2 requests one was to have french fries and the other was to have the asparagus cooked very well.  When the food came the french fries were cold.  The asparagus was hard as could be.  I spoke to the waitperson and she assured me that she had made the request.  I am sure she did.  She took back the 2 items and came back shortly with warm french fries and almost raw asparagus.  The chicken was completely tasteless as was the sauce.  I guess the recession has hit this company and they are cutting back in many ways.  I used to like this restaurant, but will think long and hard to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-fort-lauderdale?start=280
