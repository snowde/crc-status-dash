Michael H.,"Houston, TX",47,8,,1.0,2/19/2017,"Avoid their take out service at all costs.  I placed the order from home and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I made it there just after the 20 minute wait and the guy told me it wasn't quite ready yet.  15 minutes later I asked him if he could check on it, which he looked rather put out by - and ran off to find out.  By the look of the conversation - it didn't appear my order had even been started.  I was finally out of there 50 minutes after placing my order. I get that CF is always super busy.  But don't tell your customers food will be ready and then make them wait 30 minutes.  We will never do do take out from there again.  (Plus, to be honest, by the time I got it home - it was warm, but certainly not hot - or enjoyable - and for $43... yah, I'll pass.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=20
Nicolette M.,"Webster, TX",200,23,,4.0,10/3/2017,"So, with every The Cheesecake Factory I've dined at, there's always been a little bit of a wait. This recent experience was for my husband's birthday. Manny was our waiter - very well mannered and knowledgeable. My kiddo had a bacon hamburger with all the fixin's, my husband had tacos and I had the chicken and biscuits. My husband's meal was ok. He didn't get a choice of sides and it came with rice/beans. He did order a margarita and was very pleased by that. My son loved his hamburger and I was ultimately satisfied with my meal. We each took home a slice of cheesecake and spent about $100 on the whole meal. Seated immediately for a very early dinner (around 5pm) and spent about an hour there. Will go again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=20
Buying Selling Homes In Texas S.,"Houston, TX",36,6,1,4.0,7/12/2017,"Cheesecake is really good. I tried the fried Cuban rolls which were really good. They are paired with this green sauce that I must say, is excellent. You won't want to eat these without this sauce.

Elina H.,"League City, TX",8,69,43,4.0,2/1/2017,"I personally was super impressed by the wide variety of gluten free items. Had a delicious bacon cheeseburger and it was top notch. The fries were delicious, albeit a little too salty. Nothing a little ketchup can't fix. The flourless chocolate cake is extremely rich, but very tasty! It's a little expensive ($55 for 3 people, at lunchtime) but it's good to indulge every once in awhile.

Aalia U.,"Austin, TX",173,231,7,5.0,6/1/2016,"I went here for just cheesecake and coffee for my birthday and the service was beyond incredible.

Bradley R.,"Pasadena, TX",14,160,21,5.0,6/2/2016,"What I like about The Cheesecake Factory is not the cheesecake (which is VERY good) - it is more about the menu and the quality of the food served each and every time. I also enjoy the hot, fresh bread brought out to enjoy as you look at their massive menu. I have had a variety of salads, sandwiches, chicken dishes, pork chops, meat loaf, pasta, fish, and LOVE their Brioche French Toast and bacon served during their Sunday brunch. My last meal there was a Bacon, Bacon Burger that was truly one of the best burgers I have ever had. I'd like to close with a tip - The Cheesecake Factory now has an app you can down load that gives you a code to give to your server so you can see your tab and pay when you are ready to go rather than wait for a check. I will return again and again, and would definitely recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=20

Coffees were good (I added some chocolate icing to my mocha from the cheesecake because I'm shameless and have no self control when it comes to a chocolate. No regrets.

I came in ordered and waited, after 30 minutes my food still wasn't ready. This was at a non-busy time, it was about 11:00 pm when I placed my order. I asked about my food and they said they were just waiting on my side of Asparagus, so after another ten minutes I just left without it, and all I got was an ""I'm sorry about that.""

We tried calling in a couple of days earlier to make reservations, however we were told they couldn't accommodate reservations for party size that big. So we came in and was told the wait for inside was 2 hours. However the wait to sit in the patio was short. We were celebrating a birthday so we just went ahead and took the patio dining since we didn't want to wait the 2 hours even though we tried calling the reservations in earlier. In the future they should take this into consideration seeing that we spent over $400. It showed a  lack of accommodation and customer service The a Cheesecake Factory has.

Tina E.,"Corpus Christi, TX",114,291,359,2.0,6/8/2017,Their cheesecake may be good but I've never really been impressed with their food.  I've given it at least 5 chances at different locations too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=20
Niki P.,"Houston, TX",12,34,150,5.0,10/11/2016,"We live about 45 minutes from this location, but have no problem going out of our way to come here. This service is always great. Our last 3 visits we sat at the bar and each time she (a different female each time) was amazing. Our drinks are always perfect and the food is always perfection. We always get the cheese bread with the garlic parm dip and recently we tried the avocado rolls..So good! My go to drink is the Passion Fruit mojito and my dish is always Chicken Carbonara. Always, always, delish... Plus, there's always plenty leftover to take to work the next day for lunch ;-)  The restaurant is situated in a beautiful location (even though the freeway and nearby roads are undergoing a facelift).  I could probably mention the same other 5,123,789 things that have already been mentioned, but out of the 3 locations that are all relatively the same distance for us (Galleria and Memorial City being the other 2) this is always our top pick! Never a disappointment!

Allie W.,"Houston, TX",23,38,,4.0,9/4/2016,"We have only been here maybe two times since I moved here to Texas. I usually stay away simply because this is the kind of place you to go on your ""cheat day"" haha! The service has always been good. A little slow both times we went and we did have to wait a few times in refills of our drinks. The food is always delicious and definitely don't expect to leave hungry. Pace yourself if you're eyeing the cheesecake menu for dessert for sure! Their Cuban sandwich is SO good and my two favorite appetizers are the fried macaroni and cheese and their egg rolls! Every time we drive by the parking lot is always full so I can't really help out on a better time to come however we came around lunch time on a Sunday and there was no wait!  The one thing I just can't get passed is the prices of most things. For two of us it was almost $50 so I'd you're looking for a reasonable place to eat lunch, etc, I don't recommend.

Austin T.,"Friendswood, TX",3,14,26,3.0,1/10/2018,"First off, I have to say that this is much better than the PF Changs across the parking lot. That said, there are still some problems that need to be addressed. One of which, being the price. It's a bit pricey, so don't be surprised when your check comes out to more than $60. Second, the parking space is just terrible. It definitely does not service the amount of people coming into Pf Changs AND The Cheesecake Factory.  However, there are some good things about the restaurant as well.  I highly suggest ordering off of the happy hour menu, because it has a decent selection of foods that will leave you more than full. Second, the service was pretty great. I felt like the staff was actually interested in what I had to say, and the staff was very helpful.  Finally, I must discuss the restroom situation. Apparently, The Cheesecake Factory thinks that a dark closet with blaring music is the equivalent of a restroom. It is definitely not! After my trip to the lavatory, I realized this place was not as great as I had heard, but, I still recommend going here instead of going to PF Changs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3
Jose G.,"Houston, TX",3,18,16,1.0,1/5/2018,"Just terrible.  Took the wife and kids out to dinner and it's was disappointing to say the least. $7 for a quesadilla with very little cheese, literally like 50 cents worth of ingredients (tortillas and cheese, no sides) . My wife had the California avocado salad and it looked old and composed of less than fresh vegetables. She said it was terrible, only had a few bites.  My son and the corn dog meal it was surprisingly better than expected.  I ordered a hopadillo  beer and they were out , I ordered the classic burger but requested fresh or raw onions in place of the ""grilled onions"". My food comes out about 10-15 minutes after everyone else's, I have to wait for the less than stellar (but friendly) waiter to bring condiments because apparently I'm the only one that eats a burger with mayo and mustard. As I'm fixing my burger I notice a giant slab of ""grilled onions"" (1/4 of an entire onion), I remind the waiter I orders raw onions which I confirmed he understood when he took the order, he basically calls me a liar but offers to get raw onions. He brings the onions and I notice they have me cabbage instead of lettuce, who eats a burger with cabbage? The biggest offense of all, I ordered my burger cooked medium, after all the other stuff they screwed up, I decide to check. It was cooked well past well done. I politely requested to send it back and cancel my order, the waiter was nice and took it back, even offered to let me keep the fries as a conciliation prize. He says he will send the manager over.  The manager comes over and is clueless, tells me they're out of lettuce and fresh onions, etc. then asks if my burger was under or over cooked. I decline to re order, since my family already ate their food and they managed to mess up a ""classic burger"" so bad, I don't think I can ever go back to this place.  Just terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3

Lauren F.,"Round Rock, TX",91,244,169,3.0,11/4/2017,"The beginning of my visit did not go well. Had I based my entire visit on the first twenty minutes, they would have only gotten 1 star. My family went in, asked for a table, NOT a booth for three. The people behind us came in with three as well and was given our table, because they write reservations as numbers not names. So they were seated first and we were told that if we wanted a table it could be a very long time. We sqeezed uncomfortably into a booth.  One by one we excused ourselves to use the restroom and wash our hands. First, who has two stalls for a place that holds that many people. There was a line going out the door. Second the ladies room had not been attended to in a long time. One stall was out of toilet paper in the holders and the people were using a roll off the floor. In the second stall which I'll post a pic of, it was just about to be the same. All the trashcans were packed and overflowing. There were no papertowls to dry your hands... my dad came out and said that the mens room didn't have running water. He told a manager, but the manager could care less. So my dad had to eat with soap on his hands.  Things finally got better when our food came. Mine was absolutely delicious (Eggplant Parmesan) mom liked her salad and dad said is Cuben was good but very dry.  Then came our cheesecakes. You can't go to the C heesecake Factory and not get cheesecake! They were amazing.

I wanted to try something new this trip, opted for the Crispy Pineapple Chicken and Shrimp with a side of the Glazed Carrots with Pecans.  My entree was full of flavor and very tasty, similar to a sweet and sour dish you would find in a high end Chinese restaurant. The standout was the carrots! They were amazing, mind blowing even!

Our waitress was Zambrina and everyone liked her. She seemed to be new but made up for it with her smile and great personality. I had the Bacon-Bacon Burger. STOP THE PRESS!!!!! This had to be one of the best burgers I have ever had. I will definitely go back and order this again and again and again!!! My grandson's children's pizza was large and he loved it. My wife had the sausage, shrimp pasta bowl. She said it was delicious and ate the whole thing which is totally unusual. There was an order of apple crisp that was ordered to be split by 2 of the party which could have easily served 4 adults!!! Lots of food, great service all $85! This was a great deal!!!

With it being located right by the mall, it's perfect for a respite before or after a day of shopping. As expected, the ambiance is nice and intimate, but it also is a good place for a group to get together and celebrate a special occasion.

However, there were 6 empty tables with no signs. After 20 minutes, we sat and ordered the famous meatloaf, chicken and some pasta. After another 20 minutes, the waitress came back and told me that they were out of meatloaf and I asked her to get the rest. After an hour, we did not receive any service at all! And my wife had to leave to work while she was starving. By the time I was leaving with her, they brought the food! So I drove my wife back to work and my parents stayed and waited for me to come back. Not only did we have a good time; but also we did not get any offers to compensate their irresponsibilities.

Rebecca H.,"Houston, TX",194,231,906,5.0,8/14/2016,"Low-Carb friendly restaurant alert!  Whenever I'm having a little discomfort fitting into my pants, I decide to cut back on the carbs which also means cutting back on going out to eat :'(  Luckily this place has something for the keto, Atkins, and low carb-ers!  Our waiter Travis was so awesome! I don't think the restaurant looks at Yelp reviews but they should and give this guy a raise or high five or something. We told Travis we were cutting back on carbs and he immediately showed us several things we could choose from.  We were starving so we decided to get the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap appetizer. It comes with romaine lettuce leaves and a bowl of the mushroom chicken teriyaki tasting mixture to make your own wraps. It was very delicious.  My boyfriend decided to get the bacon cheese spinach omelette. Yea they serve omelettes all day!  It normally comes with fried potatoes and toast, but the waiter offered tomatoes and fruit salad to substitute. It was really good! Definitely worth coming for breakfast/lunch/dinner for!  I had the steak medallions on the skinnylicious menu. It normally comes as steak medallions with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies with a Madeira sauce. I believe it was in the 590 calories or less section. I already know that their mashed potatoes are delicious but not today  :'''( Travis suggested cooked spinach as a substitute and it went perfectly with the meal. Best part for my fellow keto-ers. They have low carb cheesecake! The crust is a walnut almond flour mixture (I think?). I believe it's 9 carbs per slice, so splitting or enjoying by yourself without the guilt is great!

Although they offer a lot of different options their quality of food is just ok , and for the price it's almost below average . Their service is also usually lacking.

My Parmesan and herb crusted chicken was full of flavor, reminiscent of past school lunches - in a good way, of course, no actual school lunch could surpass the meal I had - and juicy. The green beans on the side were the right firmness and buttery. However, the mashed potatoes were unusually disappointing. The texture was dry, the flavor bland, and the seasonings nonexistent.  Th cheesecake, of course, was amazing. We ordered two - the 30th anniversary and the Godiva.

And it had both. The waiter seemed annoyed that I sent it back. The ranch on the salad taste like they only put miracle whip on it. Thy charge extra for everything. It just seemed like everything was over priced. If you're looking to spend a little money then I'd recommend this place. You might just get a sucky waiter.

Tonys M.,"Houston, TX",4,10,3,2.0,10/10/2017,"Each time we go to this location, I get the Cobb Salad. Today, I was very disappointed in their ""new"" version of a smaller Cobb Salad which included purple cabbage and a very small amount of shredded chicken. The waitress and the manager said they were re-working some of their recipes and the Cobb Salad is included. There was nothing on the menu stating the salad was now made with purple cabbage. A Cobb Salad is typically made with chopped salad greens (iceberg lettuce and Romaine lettuce), crisp bacon,  grilled  chicken breast, hard-boiled eggs, avocado, and dressing. Putting purple cabbage in the salad and decreasing the size makes it look like the restaurant is trying to save money by adding a cheap cabbage filler. Since most of the food in this restaurant is marginal, I will go some place that is not trying to keep the costs low by altering their recipes. Not happy with my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40
Mrs. D.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,10/9/2017,This review is not about their food. It's about the lack of kindness to a customer who was choking at their resturant. We observed a customer choking on 10/07/17. He was obvisoluy in distress and his family was trying to help but were unable. They had two toddlers and the wife was attempting to help him. There were several Cheescake employees that just stood there and offered no kind of help. I asked them to get a manager but no one did. The gentleman walked outside and by the grace of God was able to dislodge whatever he was choking on. The paramedics did show up after a while (the wife called 911) but the Cheesecake manager nor any of the employees came out to check on him. I was very disheartened to witness all this from The Cheesecake Factory.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40

It is our place for any celebration that we have, birthdays, Mother Day, Father Day etc... there are always minor complaints in my visits to this location, but yesterday was above acceptable. We went last night to celebrate my birthday. We were party of 9 including kids. We sit outside, and it was very windy, and they didn't have curtains to block the winds. Our waiter was a nice guy, but he might got busy, so another girl brought our food. She throw our food on the floor, which was half of the egg rolls appetizer, we complained about it, so she went and brought two pieces of egg rolls in a small bowl. I asked to talk to the manger which he started arguing with my husband that we lost two pieces, and these are your two pieces. I step in, and i told that rude manager that our problem is not how many pieces we had lost, it is about how they served it to us  in a bowl, instead of a plate with its dressing and rice noodles. I left without even eating cheese cake for my birthday. Never again. There are other cheese cake factory locations that have nicer employees and managers.

Kayla N.,"Houston, TX",91,300,2442,2.0,2/23/2015,Very disappointed in this place tonight.  The beet and goat cheese salad was extremely salty.  Mini crab bites were barely warm and greasy dynamite shrimps.

A T.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",29,112,373,3.0,12/21/2015,"We arrived here at 6pm on a Saturday evening. That is probably the best time to arrive, and anymore after that, you will be looking at a very long time. Our party of 5 was seated promptly--just the location was awkward because we were seated near the door to the outside seating and whenever the door was opened, freezing air came through. I suppose this isn't a problem all year round.  Our server was an attentive lady and gave us supple time to decide on our orders. We were given the complimentary bread and we also asked for olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Our starter was the eggroll sampler. It included the Crispy Cuban, the avocado, Firecracker salmon, and the Tex-Mex. It came with 4 different sauces that I think complimented each kind of eggroll nicely, however you paired it. I liked the tamarind-cashew sauce the best.  I opted for appetizers as my main course. I had the pear and bleu cheese flatbread pizza and the ahi tartare. The flatbread is very small, but coupled with the complimentary bread, the eggrolls, my other meal, and forking off of my sister's plate--it overall makes a filling dinner. The pizza has really nice flavour, btw. Pear and bleu cheese go so very well together. Highly recommend it! The tartare on the other hand... suuuupeeeerrrbbblyy--wait for it--SUBPAR. It was drenched in soy sauce which completely drowned the fresh flavour it's supposed to have. It came with 4 small crisps which did not do any justice. Bleh bleh.  My sister had the Eveleyn's Favourite Pasta--waitress points out it's a vegetarian dish as a reminder--and it tasted alright, as well. Not in love with it, but it had nice, smoky flavours with a kick from the seasonings. She just didn't like the super al dente state of the rigatoni.   My mom had the almond crusted salmon salad. She said it was pretty good. The vinaigrette coupled it well.  My dad had the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta--he said it was a little spicy but it being jambalaya, well, he had to shut it. He enjoyed it, though.  My brother had the lemon-herb chicken which came with mashed potatoes and carrots. It's a big serving and we had leftovers to scarf home.  For dessert, we went for two items: I chose the limoncello cake and my mom went for the mango-key lime cheesecake. Let me tell you... I felt like a fata** after forking those desserts down. The limoncello was sweet but the cake part of it was a nice equal. Big slice of it, too.  The mango-key lime cheesecake was delicious. It paired sooo well; our forks were fending each other off from the last slice.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory as a chain restaurant does try to hold its name. Expect that this place is packed. From sitting to leaving, it took 2 and 1/2hrs... a lot of waiting, but if you've got good enough company and patience, then yes, I recommend a visit.  Just had one extra problem: one of our menus had spaghetti stuck between the pages. Yuck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40
Melissa G.,"Seabrook, TX",53,29,44,4.0,11/15/2015,"This is my third trip to this particular Cheesecake Factory...so that must be good sign!  I was thrilled that they were opening one up at Baybrook Mall since the closest one's were the Galleria or the Woodlands.  30-50 mile trips are not on my to do list.  I have personally had their Spaghetti and meatballs, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, the Steak Diane, the Grilled Chicken Club w/ fries (which were excellent!) and the Fish Tacos.  Everything has been very good!  The Cheesecake Factory has put together a menu that is filled with colorful and flavorful foods.  There is something for everyone on their huge menu.  Others in my party ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, the Grilled Pork Chop and the Fettuccini Alfredo.  They all looked incredible!  Homemade apple sauce with chunks of apple accompanied the Grilled Pork Chop....and the comment was made that it was better than Perry's!  As far as the Cheesecake goes.....INCREDIBLE!  I have had the Vanilla Bean, the Banana Cream (tastes just like heavenly banana pudding), and tonight, the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake.  I always get mine to go so I can enjoy it at home.  I do not share these wonderful pieces of heaven!  I would give 5 stars for food, 5 stars for service,  but have to give 3 for the price of their food.  The Cheesecake is reasonably priced, but the food menu is a bit steep.   I highly recommend all of the things that I have tried.  Out of them all, I would have to say my favorite was the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  I plan to try the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp on my next visit because it looked delicious with the plantains, black beans, mango salsa and rice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40

Tanya C.,"Bacliff, TX",0,31,14,1.0,6/30/2016,"My husband and I are a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, just NOT this location. They skimp out on everything possible and service is hit or miss. I have been to Cheesecake Factory about 50x in 5 different locations and never had a problem at any other location. I have been here 4x and had a problem 3x already. I guess I can't blame anyone but myself for returning, but this will be the last.  1st time: The warm crab & artichoke dip tasted different and I finally figured out why after 5 minutes....they added pieces of bread in the dip. I ended up returning it and the manager agreed there was bread in there and the texture of the dip didn't look normal. He did take it off the bill but I was so upset because I dined there that night because I was craving the dip. The entree was fine and service was just ok. 2nd time: I ordered the Thai lettuce wrap and the chicken strip were much smaller than usual but I didn't say anything. Service was horrible this time. We just left unhappy. 3rd time: Like a dummy I returned because I was craving the Thai lettuce wrap. The closest cheesecake factory is in the galleria area and too far to drive during rush hour. So I settled. They said they ran out of Thai lettuce wraps (not sure how a restaurant can run out of chicken and lettuce). I ended up ordering miso salmon.  It was good and the waitress was great. I had a pleasant dine in experience, finally! 4th time: Today I went with my family and I ordered the steak medallion for my mother. It did not look like the picture on the website or their screen display at all! I understand it's a small portion since it's on the skinnylicious menu but the picture in the website is the skinnylicious steak medallion since there is no other steak medallion on the full entree menu. There were 4 pieces of steak the size of a quarter each. All 4 pieces together was not even 1/4 of the picture.  Anyway I asked for the waiteaitress and her and another waitress agreed that it did not look like the picture. The manager came over and said well there's nothing he can do since he didn't see how it came out. I told him this is exactly how it came out since my mom never cutted into any of the meat, she used a fork to pick at the veggies. I didn't like how he insinuated that she had cut and ate into it already. She was eating the veggies cause she was hungry and it took him over 5 minutes to come over. My mom didn't want any trouble so she said it was fine and continued eating.  When she began eating the steak she said it tasted more like lamb than beef and I insisted it might just be the seasoning. She didnt want it anymore and was picking at the veggies only.  So I tried it and agreed it tasted like lamb. I asked the waitress to return it. The bill came and it wasn't taken off. The waitress said she would go ask another manager. David came and he did agree to take it off. He was much more pleasant to speak to and actually took the time to listen to our comments unlike the other manager. The waitress was wonderful and did whatever she could to make us happy.  In addition,  my husband didn't tell me until we got home that his steak tasted well done instead of medium like he ordered.  The outter layer was bitter due to being burnt. All in all, I feel like this location is not consistent and not up to Cheesecake Factory standards. There cheesecake however has always been consistent,  but you can't really screw up defrosting frozen cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40

The waitstaff is almost always very friendly. I would recommend going early on a weekend because the wait can be very long. We usually order off the Skinnylicious menu. We love the Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella Flatbread Pizza. It's very tasty! You'd never know it was considered ""skinnylicious."" We are also absolutely addicted to their Strawberry Shortcake. It is truly HEAVEN! It's a warm, homemade sugared biscuit with vanilla ice cream in between along with fresh strawberries and loads of whipped cream. It's to die for! We'd much rather order this instead of a piece of cheesecake.  Now that it's Fall, I was super excited to order the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake. I look forward to ordering this flavor every year but I have to say it wasn't as decadent as I remember. It's like eating half pecan pie and half pumpkin pie with lots of whipped cream.

Jessica Y.,"Baytown, TX",0,18,,3.0,10/17/2017,I have dined at this location twice and on our second visit a few days ago I was a little disappointed with the food and drinks we received. I definitely do not recommend the frozen margarita. It was like drinking frozen water the only flavor we could taste was the lime we squeezed the straw in to. I have to say they do have the best veggie burger I have ever had but was disappointed that instead of lettuce on both burgers we ordered we got cabbage shreds instead. We mentioned both of these concerns with our waitress but all she said was that's why she doesn't recommend the frozen margarita (when ordering she informed us they do not have a machine) as it is hand blended and that they use a lettuce blend so it would have cabbage. However I don't understand that as the description on menus does state lettuce on their burgers not cabbage.

This is probably not like any french toast you have ever had, this is BRULÉED FRENCH TOAST! They soak the bread in a wonderful creamy custard (I heard this is done overnight,but I have not verified that info) and then grilled; not baked or fried, GRILLED until the outside has a perfect crunch. I suggest you add bacon because these two belong together, the sweet and smoky flavors compliment each other. OH MY the syrup - sweet and buttery, simply Awwwwww Goodddddd!! The coffee is usually perfect; occasionally it comes out too weak/watery, but if you ask them to bring you a real cup of coffee they will do so without question.

Ken H.,"Houston, TX",38,231,1177,3.0,2/23/2015,"This is a hard choice between the food that was good and the accommodations not so much. First, the good.  We ordered the lunch meatloaf and it wasn't good it was superb.  The server was friendly and attentive enough (though less than stellar). Now, the bad.  For a place with this physical grandeur the accommodations were not good.  I went to the restroom to wash my hands.  The foam soap was thin/watered.  I wasn't able to get a lather and barely able to get a skim of soap on my hands.  Like McDonald's they have blow dryers instead of paper. Unlike McDonald's, you have to stick your hands into their dryer device.  I wasn't able to hold hands still enough to avoid wiping them on the sides of the thing, so I wasn't sure I was better off than when I came in.   Finally, they have no WiFi.  Very tall ceilings with grand chandlers but no WiFi. ==================== Note to somebody:  This is weird but they had so many choices of what sounded like wonderful cheesecakes I was unable to choose one. We were going to get it to go and some of the choices sounded so delicious I knew if I made the wrong choice I'd be upset and self-flagellating for choosing the wrong one instead of one of the other grand sounding choices. The only solution was to not get any. I guess it's a damn good thing I chose the right wife. UPDATE:  Went for the second time in more than three years.  Meatloaf was still good, but the service was bad.  There were many empty tables.  In our area I could only see three other occupied tables and at least two of these had already been served when we arrived.  Obviously meatloaf is already prepared but it took 15-20 minutes to get it.  We could have snacked on bread but it didn't arrive until about a minute before the food. Our server was inattentive.  It was not a good experience.  I'm docking them one star.  If it weren't for the meatloaf it would have been two stars. ___ We've Eaten Out Every Meal for 25 years",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=60

Wm M.,"Houston, TX",8,8,,1.0,6/7/2016,We took my son here for his 23rd Birthday. Such a disappointing experience. I have traveled across the U.S. ate at several but this hands down was the absolute worst by far. We were seated in a booth a party of 6 mind you three grown men.... This was the start we let the hostess know upon arrival that we had a birthday as well as our waiter (NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED !!) Asked for drinks upon waiter coming to table three were forgotten asked for the 2nd time ..nothing once our food came out it cold asked for drinks again finally half through meal they arrived. Asked for manager this to fell upon deaf ears the service was so bad that we decided to order desert to go which was the only think that was decent. we spent 277.00 on this experience I have called several times even left messages with corporate to be completely ignored!!!!!!

Wendy L.,"Pearland, TX",54,9,1,2.0,6/23/2016,"I visited on Father's Day and surprising got a table for 6 within a few minutes which was nice. We started with the Avocado Eggrolls which were nice and crispy on the outside yet the avocado was still chuncky and creamy inside. The dipping sauce was overly sweet and not necessary for my taste. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta as my entree. The shrimp were tail on with a light fry to them and while the menu did say the sauce had wine and basil in it, I found it too overwhelming to eat as did a guest of mine who tried it. I settled for the bread basket (which had a nice chewy baguette) and my Wild Turkey and Coke.

I got the orange chicken, I always get that lol. It's so good. I asked the waiter for soy sauce and I'm pretty sure he went across the street to PF Changs to get it for me. That was awesome.

Daughter had a chicken Caesar salad which really wasn't bad at all. My wife's grilled chicken avocado sandwich  was incredibly sloppy to eat and lacked in taste. In fairness to the waiter, he sensed that she wasn't happy with it and made an adjustment to the bill. As for the atmosphere, being it was a Friday night, it was expectedly busy, noisy, and filled with gaggles of selfie taking young ladies.

Only issue was although the table was just cleaned (still wet) it had particles and something slimy on it.  Not a big deal we just wiped it up. Once we picked up the knives we noticed they were dirty as well.   Food was prepared well overall no complaints. Portion were more then enough so you might plan on sharing if not too hungry Probably some of the best flavored edamame  we've ever had.  And of course you can't go wrong with cheesecake and we each got a piece to go While waiting for our check we watched a person cleaning with a rag and then placing the plates napkins and silverware on the table at the same time and he was handling all eating surfaces of the plates and silverware which I feel should be avoided especially if you are handling the dirty cloth you are wiping the table and seats with Makes you wonder about the kitchen...

Tracy O.,"Sumner, TX",3,13,,3.0,12/22/2016,"No complaints about the wait time or service as both were excellent. The ambience is also nice though a bit busy. The patio looked like a nice place to sit for an evening meal. The three stars is mainly for the food quality. Everyone in our party felt their food was just so-so. The portions were huge and presentation was okay, but there was always some key element missing. I got the French country salad from the skinny menu (one of maybe four things I saw that were vegetarian entrees, no vegan items seen though I wasn't looking really close) and though it was massive, it was mainly greens. Very little goat cheese or beets. Only a few asparagus. There were a decent amount of candied pecans, but with pecans and greens and very little of everything else, it was just boring. For a $10.50 salad with 5 ingredients that aren't meat, I expect more. Another person got the chicken Marsala which tasted great but was mostly noodles and not enough sauce for the noodle portion. Spaghetti and meatballs were dry and needed more sauce to balance the massive noodle portion. Chicken club sandwich was huge, but bland. The pepperoni pizza was okay, though big, but nothing to write home about. Our server was great and we had lots of people asking us if we needed anything. Drinks were filled as needed. No complaints on service at all. It's a chain and I tend to prefer local places, so maybe my opinion is biased, but the food was  boring and not well-proportioned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=80

Daniel V.,"Pearland, TX",62,138,137,2.0,3/15/2015,"Just because a place looks really nice and seems to be busy doesn't mean the restaurant is awesome. The service was not a problem at all, it's the quality of food.  We started off by ordering the factory nachos and at first glance it looked amazing. The plate was huge and the presentation was on point. As we began chipping away at the iceberg we noticed the cheese to be a little gritty and the chips to be super greasy. You get that feeling of ""blah"" in your mouth and don't want to eat anymore.  For the main course I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce and fries. I wasn't really impressed with the sandwich because the chicken seemed to have a lot of breading on it and it was also a little too greasy. The flavor was not what I expected and I had to ask the waitress if they forgot to add buffalo sauce on it. She told me the sauce is ""drizzled"" on the sandwich and got me a little extra.  We didn't want to even bother ordering any cheesecake because the thought of grease and dairy churning in your gut while doing some shopping at the mall didn't sound very pleasant. I'm not sure if I'd go back with all the other options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=80
Michael P.,"Houston, TX",3,10,,1.0,7/14/2016,"First of all the young man who seated us had a very apparent attitude. Especially after we asked to be seated at a different table rather than the one crammed next to the emergency exit. There were plenty of other empty tables. The server was pleasant enough. That was the only plus to this visit. I ordered the chicken bellagio. First it didn't come with prosciutto as it stated in the menu, second the arugla salad on top was either old or had been stored in a plastic sack for an extended period of time. It tasted bitter and past its freshness. The worst part of the dish however was the chicken. It had obviously been microwaved. It was soggy, lukewarm, tasted metallic and stale.

The bartender on duty just rolled her eyes and gave an attitude ""are you guys going to eat or drink?."" She never bothered to ask if we want to order and food items, we had to call over another bartender.  And several times when I tried to get her attention she started talking to someone else. We noticed that she was very friendly and helpful to the singles at the bar, but didn't seem to want to serve us.

Terribly greasy, even for a fried dish, way overlooked and the grease soaked in. Asked for more buffalo sauce since there was only a tiny cup for like eight pieces. Never arrived. Waitress blamed the kitchen.  Some guy came around like 3 times with random dishes, asking ""is this yours?""  Main courses were tasty though.

Lisa T.,"League City, TX",12,58,93,2.0,5/10/2014,"I've been to several locations of this chain and most earn 3-4 stars in my book, but this location is by far the worst. First, the waitstaff is terrible. I almost always get a new waiter and am often brought the wrong dish. Second, and in my opinion most importantly, the management is even worse. We were seated outside near the waterfall one particularly windy afternoon when the water from the waterfall came crashing down on top of a waitress' entire section. There were 4 tables near the falls and 3 happened to be occupied, including the one we were seated at. The women closest to the falls were hit the hardest, getting completely soaked. The table behind them had their food ruined. My table was a bit luckier- just some splashes. The waitress never apologized or offered to get the manager, instead choosing to stand there doe-eyed until she split, disappearing for over 5 minutes. When she returned it was clear she had alerted no one to the problem and had failed to offer diners napkins or new food. After a patron at one table tracked down the manager he just stood there staring at us. The patron demanded napkins for the women at the table closest to the falls and insisted they should get their bill comped. The manager offered them free cheesecake instead and returned with napkins. He never checked on our table and seemed completely bewildered. Will not be returning here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=140

The one thing I a disappointing in is the fact that they have the space to make it two stories like the Galleria location, but they didn't. They know this place is popular and out here this is the only location so you have many people coming from a larger radius area. All the food, drinks, and desert were all very good, it was busy but this was NYE and the time that I did go it was 550pm-6pm and the wait was only 1 hr. However the day before we tried to go and wait times were 50 to 70 minutes! So we waited and we waited less than an hour.  The food came out pipping hot and you could tell it didnt sit for long u if under warmers. The only complaints I have is parking and wait times for the place. Its in the same parking lot as the small its off in its own section but its still just not enough parking, they have a section for valet but honestly I would rather have more parking its just too small of an area so you have to park in more of the mall area and walk, its not far but still when you have a resturant like that you expect them to have more parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=140

I've even looked up mock recipes online for several of their pastas while I'm cooking at home. Don't be afraid to try a steak - they will cook it perfectly, all of their pastas are delicious.

Alaleh A.,"Hobby, Houston, TX",0,5,,1.0,1/17/2013,"We went there on a Saturday, and knowing how busy it can get, we were there at 6:30. We were a party of four made up of two 9 month pregnant women and our husbands. This was supposed to be our last outing before we have the babies. They said 45 mins to one hr wait. We waited while standing for 40 mins then my husband asked if we could sit out in the patio which was closed due to the cold. They said ok. We sat there for another hour and 20 minutes.  After several inquiries and my husband having mentioned we are very ovviously pregnant they gave us a table at 8:40.  But wait, the table was a small booth that made it impossible for our pregnant bellies to fit on both sides of the table.  The waitress said she would see what she can do. Then the manager came and said I'm sorry but if you want another table, it will be a twenty minute wait. But he suggested that if we both sit on the same side of the table and push the table toward our poor husbands we could fit!!! Unbelievable!!! We did that bc we were way too hungry to wait any longer. He made no apologies and no offer of an appetizer or any such thing for the discomfort and long wait. Then our waitress forgot several items we asked for, and our food did not come out together. To top it all off, when our meal was done our waitress was in such a hurry for us to leave,that when we ordered cheesecake she said would you like me to bring it in a take out box so you can just take the rest with you? What??? I could not believe she said that.  I love the galleria location and went there often. But this location is just in way over its head.

Jon H.,"Pearland, TX",39,15,1,2.0,3/21/2016,"I have to keep asking myself why I keep coming back here giving this place so many chances to improve. It seems my dining experience decreases with every visit I make here, never improving on the many flaws it shows. You want to talk about over-rated, Cheesecake Factory takes the proverbial (cheese?) cake for that unwanted award.  Atmosphere: For a chain restaurant, the atmosphere is pretty decent for the layout. It's undeniable that this place is a popular dinner venue given the crowded capacity at night and the noise level it brings, but that doesn't appeal very much to me. Wait times vary, but most of the times I have visited it has usually been a 30 minute wait at minimum.  Service: Hit-and-miss at times, leaning more towards the lacking side of it. Sometimes you get waiters/waitresses that bend over backwards for their customers, while some don't look like they even want to be there (and poorly affecting the service quite a bit). This time around the service was decent, nothing too special but the waiter was doing his job well enough. Food: What a horrible mistake I make every time wanting to try different things the menu has to offer. They have a big menu, but it seems that every time I try something new the quality of the food goes downhill from there. Tonight was no exception, I ordered the Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms while my fiance had Miso-Glazed Salmon over rice. This dish I had gotten ranks as one of the worst dishes I have ever had, border-line inedible. The Chicken Marsala was almost tasteless, but even worse the little flavor it did have was strange and repugnant. The mushrooms, coated with the supposed ""Marsala"" around it was a disaster. The bow tie pasta resting underneath it while tender was completely bland and tasteless. I would assume they were hoping the Marsala sauce would be a good substitute for seasoning, but the sauce was already disgusting to begin with. For the first time in a while I reached over for the salt at the end of the table to somehow salvage this mess of this dish, but there was no salvaging this shipwreck of a plate. I couldn't come to finish it, I was severely disappointed with what I had ordered. My fiance's food wasn't any better, the salmon lacked any real glaze on top, and even worse the salmon itself was extremely dry and flaked in wadded chunks of culinary disaster. Our food was horrible, this was one of the worst meals I have ever had. We had cheesecake afterwards of course, but that didn't save the meal experience for us.  Conclusion: This place should honestly just stick to it's own name and make cheesecake, because that seems to be the only redeeming quality of this chain restaurant. While some of the food here has been decent to alright at best in the past (and that's being generous with my critique), the food served tonight was inexcusable. There's no saving this sinking ship unless they do a complete overhaul o their food and go back to the drawing board. Utterly disappointed, there is absolutely no way I could recommend this restaurant to anyone I know. Save your money, and pick a better restaurant in the Baybrook Mall area. There are way better options out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=100

Jolynn G.,"League City, TX",200,24,29,1.0,2/14/2016,"I visit this location about once a month and can tell you almost every other visit I  have to ask for clean silverware that doesn't have stuck on it.. Gross! Also, if you sit in the patio area the seats nearly always have bird poop on them and the staff only wipes it down if you are the one to ask for it to be cleaned. My final straw with this company was yesterday when I was sitting out on the patio with my kids and surrounded by other families, there was a large table with ladies and a few men and children and this table had way too many drinks. I am all down for having a great time and understand when it's a large group it always tends to get a little loud and that's expected, but when it's drunks screaming over each other for over and hour and the drinks keep coming that's when it's a bit obsessive! Every table around me was staring at them and shaking their head and dropping their waiters hints but not once did the staff do anything about it. I finally asked to speak with the manager and he basically looked at me like I was the crazy one for saying something. He actually went over to their table and almost reinforced their behavior so not sure what he said to them because they only got louder. I then asked for the general manager and he was a little more helpful, and even agreed the screaming over each other nonstop was excessive. However in today's society he was too afraid to ask them to at least tone it down or cut them off since they would be driving and had children, due to the fact that he might get sued.. Really.. Are you kidding me. What about the entire restaurant being disturbed by this one table. He said it was the same as a screaming child scenario. If I wanted a bar atmosphere for my children to be exposed to I would have taken them to a bar.. Not what I thought was a family restaurant. It was the worse experience and actually didn't even finish our food nor enjoy it we ended up leaving with a merely 25% credit. What a waste of money and time!

The restaurant was packed and extremely loud, the ambiance in general was very overwhelming and made me feel uncomfortable with all the people and staff constantly in the way and running around. The food was not great the best thing I ordered was the red velvet cheesecake which was kinda on the sweet side. The fried mac and cheese are always talked about and regarded as amazing but I don't know if it's me or that specific dish but the cheese was a little gross and the texture was bad does not live up to its hype, but the worst thing about this restaurant has to be the fact that in the women's restroom there is only two stalls..... how does a large restaurant that is always crowded only have two stalls it's unbelievable. I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the free bread is good, the waiter was nice and easy going as well as very helpful and was quick to fix any mistakes or replace unwanted meals also the cheesecake was alright.

We had a party of 10 and they told us the wait would be an hour or our party would have to split up to 2 separate tables that are far from each other. My husband had to bring it to the managers attention that there was enough open seating available in the bar area to accommodate our party. And even then he was reluctant to seat and help us.

I have never been a fan of cheese cakes factory until recently when I decided to venture out and ordered the bistro shrimp pasta dish. The pasta and shrimp were cooked to perfection when I ordered the first time. I went again tonight and I can tell the kitchen was either short staffed or someone new was training. My battered shrimp came out stuck together and when I separated it, I tasted raw batter between the two pieces of shrimp. I sent the dish back. Travis got a Caesar salad for me to eat while I waited for them to re-cook my dish. Travis, our waiter was wonderful!!! I really excited when I saw him bringing my pasta dish to my table (for the second time). I soon found out that the cooks just took my shrimp and cooked it well done. The batter was so hard and crispy, I could not stick a fork into it. The manager said that they were supposed to make a new dish not re-cook it.

April J.,"Houston, TX",24,9,7,1.0,6/15/2016,"This cheesecake factory has the worst customer service. Ive gone here several time since I suffer from gluten issues and it seems every time I go something goes wrong. The first time I got a burger medium well and the meat was still raw. After explaining nicely to the manager that I would just like to get a cooked burger and was willing to drive back, he argued saying that a medium to medium well has pink on the inside and it was fine. I eat my steaks usually rare, I don't mind pink in the middle, what I do mind is getting a burger and it being raw. Finally after seeing the raw meat he apologized and said yes this was completely undercooked. Took care of my meal and I was fine with that. Even after being given a RAW burger, I still have gone back numerous times. I usually ask for my sauces on the side and they get that right about 15% of the time, but I'm not too picky, I suck it up and eat it with no problem. However, tonight, I wanted a gf bun. My husband gets home with it and it's wrapped in lettuce. Well, if I wanted a lettuce wrapped burger I would have gotten that anywhere. My husband called back and asked, nicely, if he could just bring it back and get a gf bun, the to go lady told him she was aware she gave him a lettuce burger and was rather rude on the phone. He asked to speak to a manger thinking maybe she didn't know. I live about 15 min. Away and it took the manager that long to pick up the phone. Once my husband got there they still were unsure why it was given like that. Finally after waiting they decided to tell him they ran out. Why couldn't the to go lady mention that. Maybe she didn't know, understandable, but for the manager to be so busy he couldn't listen to a customer request until he was already there is rather annoying. So now we had to get the whole meal replaced because his food was cold and gross and all the manager could do was comp mt burger and a free cheesecake? Honestly, I liked going here because of the gluten free options, but after being screwed over so many times I think it's time to move on. Luckily more restaurants, even nearby ones, are having more options for people with food allergies so I will start taking my business somewhere else, where my food will be cooked, managers won't argue and actually care about their job.

I first discovered it when I lived in the Los Angeles area and have loved it ever since.  We came in on a Friday evening after shopping at the Baybrook Mall. It was busy, there were a lot of people sitting outside waiting. We were quoted a wait time of 30 minutes so we waited outside for a bit. About 15 minutes later the little buzzer started going off. I love when the wait time is less than they say.  The hostesses were friendly and handled all the masses well. We were sat and taken care of right away. Now it's time to delve into that HUGE menu. It really is huge, they have a lot of different options including chicken dishes, steaks, breakfast, pasta, salads, small plates, and don't forget the 1.5 pages dedicated just to cheesecake.  With this being said, I try to get something new every time I go. This time I went for a chicken dish that was topped with mozzarella, mushrooms, and asparagus served with the most delicious mashed potatoes ever. I was really impressed with the quality and the size of my meal.  The service was great the whole time and he was attentive to us even though his section was full the whole time.

I had been to the Galleria location of The Cheesecake factory a few years back and every time I heard someone talk about The Cheesecake Factory I had a problem remembering if I enjoyed the food or not which should have been my 1st clue, but since it wasn't clear to me I decided to give the newly open Baybrook Mall location a shot. I knew I probably hadn't made the wisest decision  as soon as I was seated because the way the table was set, because at ""The Cheesecake Factory"" they sit all of your silverware directly on the table... Now let's pause for a minute and give that a second to set in... Yes ladies and gentlemen they set the utensils that you use to pick up food that's going in your mouth directly on the table. That same table that the bus boy just came by and wiped with the same rag that he used to wipe the other 39 tables in the dining area, can you say unsanitary? Not to mention there were residual crumbs of something still left on the table. Even Jim-Bob's BBQ knows to at least wrap the utensils in a paper towel.  So immediately my girlfriend and I asked for silverware that hadn't been placed on the table, and what's the 1st thing our waitress does when she brings them? Tries to sit them back on the same dirty table(yes I am shaking my head too right now). So anyway we order the ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"", Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes, and two lemonades one strawberry and the other one regular. So the waitress brings out the lemonades and they are tartest lemonades I've ever had in my life. I guess when life gave The Cheesecake Factory lemons they squeezed them directly in a glass and served them to their customers. They must've had some idea of how tart the lemonade was because they put sugar around the rim of the glass which gave the lemonade all the class of boxed wine. And that's not all I haven't even started on the food yet. The ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"" didn't have a sauce it had more of an oil with tablespoon upon tablespoon of black pepper ugh. The chicken was so charred it taste like I was licking a BBQ grill not to mention it had 6 of the tiniest shrimp I've ever seen in a shrimp pasta dish ever. The Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes was lifeless and the White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle Cheesecake was one dimensional  . I will never again in life go to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=200

Being a friday afternoon we knew it would be busy and decided just to order take out. i called and was placed on hold for 15 minutes before someone finally took my order. That should have told me what was about to follow.      I ordered a burger medium rare and it was well done. The bun was soak through soggy.  The fries were soggy too.  I ordered onion rings as well and that failed to make it in the bag even though i was charged for it. My wife ordered a chicken pasta dish and you literally had to search for chicken. It was like an alfredo sauce and it was clumpy even after being reheated. I called to give feedback about our experience and again 10 minute wait for a manager to get on phone. If i was a manager and had customer complaint on the phone I'm making that a priority getting right to it. Its like they don't care. Just from my negative experience and talking to friends and family, there have been 20 or more people that changed their mind and took their business somewhere else. Sorry cheesecake factory, thats about $300 -$400 that you lost out on.  That place is not worth the wait.

So we spoke with a manager he told us he would comp out appetizer, that didn't happen. Then when we sat down our waitress was hardly at the table. It took 20 minutes to get our drink order. Then it took 45 minutes for 3 plates of food to come out. My desert took another 45 minutes. We didn't even bother to get another round of drinks. We all were waiters and understand it gets hectic but we were the only table that the waitress had. The manager said he would take care of us but it never happened.

I first discovered it when I lived in the Los Angeles area and have loved it ever since.  We came in on a Friday evening after shopping at the Baybrook Mall. It was busy, there were a lot of people sitting outside waiting. We were quoted a wait time of 30 minutes so we waited outside for a bit. About 15 minutes later the little buzzer started going off. I love when the wait time is less than they say.  The hostesses were friendly and handled all the masses well. We were sat and taken care of right away. Now it's time to delve into that HUGE menu. It really is huge, they have a lot of different options including chicken dishes, steaks, breakfast, pasta, salads, small plates, and don't forget the 1.5 pages dedicated just to cheesecake.  With this being said, I try to get something new every time I go. This time I went for a chicken dish that was topped with mozzarella, mushrooms, and asparagus served with the most delicious mashed potatoes ever. I was really impressed with the quality and the size of my meal.  The service was great the whole time and he was attentive to us even though his section was full the whole time.

Then he proceeded to be very ugly with his attitude towards my husband and brother in law. I think because they were not all dressed up he thought we didn't have money and wouldn't tip well. Any way no matter the look of a person you treat everyone the same and with excellent service. I know people have bad days so we just shook it off until it took him 15 minutes to bring us our drinks and then another 20 to take our order. Then the server was in front of my husband and my husband was about to ask for another soda and the lady behind us called him and he ran over there without even acknowledging my husband or coming back to see what he needed. We were going to buy cheesecake because duh you don't go to the cheesecake factory and not get cheesecake but at this point I was so done with his rudeness and idgaf attitude towards us that we left. I did not want to tip him but I do know that the waiters tips also go to other staff like the bussers so I left a tip. This was my husbands first time there and will be his last.

I have been here several times now since I moved to this area and it is easily my favorite restaurant overall. They have a very diverse menu and I haven't disliked a single dish I've ever tried. I've even looked up mock recipes online for several of their pastas while I'm cooking at home. Don't be afraid to try a steak - they will cook it perfectly, all of their pastas are delicious.

It was the never ending dinner and I was worn out by the time we left. Corporate Cheesecake Factory needs to check on the management at this suburban location.

Alaleh A.,"Hobby, Houston, United States",0,5,,1.0,17/1/2013,"We went there on a Saturday, and knowing how busy it can get, we were there at 6:30. We were a party of four made up of two 9 month pregnant women and our husbands. This was supposed to be our last outing before we have the babies. They said 45 mins to one hr wait. We waited while standing for 40 mins then my husband asked if we could sit out in the patio which was closed due to the cold. They said ok. We sat there for another hour and 20 minutes.  After several inquiries and my husband having mentioned we are very ovviously pregnant they gave us a table at 8:40.  But wait, the table was a small booth that made it impossible for our pregnant bellies to fit on both sides of the table.  The waitress said she would see what she can do. Then the manager came and said I'm sorry but if you want another table, it will be a twenty minute wait. But he suggested that if we both sit on the same side of the table and push the table toward our poor husbands we could fit!!! Unbelievable!!! We did that bc we were way too hungry to wait any longer. He made no apologies and no offer of an appetizer or any such thing for the discomfort and long wait. Then our waitress forgot several items we asked for, and our food did not come out together. To top it all off, when our meal was done our waitress was in such a hurry for us to leave,that when we ordered cheesecake she said would you like me to bring it in a take out box so you can just take the rest with you? What??? I could not believe she said that.  I love the galleria location and went there often. But this location is just in way over its head.

Lisa T.,"League City, United States",12,58,93,2.0,10/5/2014,"I've been to several locations of this chain and most earn 3-4 stars in my book, but this location is by far the worst. First, the waitstaff is terrible. I almost always get a new waiter and am often brought the wrong dish. Second, and in my opinion most importantly, the management is even worse. We were seated outside near the waterfall one particularly windy afternoon when the water from the waterfall came crashing down on top of a waitress' entire section. There were 4 tables near the falls and 3 happened to be occupied, including the one we were seated at. The women closest to the falls were hit the hardest, getting completely soaked. The table behind them had their food ruined. My table was a bit luckier- just some splashes. The waitress never apologized or offered to get the manager, instead choosing to stand there doe-eyed until she split, disappearing for over 5 minutes. When she returned it was clear she had alerted no one to the problem and had failed to offer diners napkins or new food. After a patron at one table tracked down the manager he just stood there staring at us. The patron demanded napkins for the women at the table closest to the falls and insisted they should get their bill comped. The manager offered them free cheesecake instead and returned with napkins. He never checked on our table and seemed completely bewildered. Will not be returning here again.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=140

The one thing I a disappointing in is the fact that they have the space to make it two stories like the Galleria location, but they didn't. They know this place is popular and out here this is the only location so you have many people coming from a larger radius area. All the food, drinks, and desert were all very good, it was busy but this was NYE and the time that I did go it was 550pm-6pm and the wait was only 1 hr. However the day before we tried to go and wait times were 50 to 70 minutes! So we waited and we waited less than an hour.  The food came out pipping hot and you could tell it didnt sit for long u if under warmers. The only complaints I have is parking and wait times for the place. Its in the same parking lot as the small its off in its own section but its still just not enough parking, they have a section for valet but honestly I would rather have more parking its just too small of an area so you have to park in more of the mall area and walk, its not far but still when you have a resturant like that you expect them to have more parking.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=140

Jay S.,"Dickinson, United States",1,6,,1.0,31/5/2015,"The last couple of times the preparation of this location has been horrible.  Dirty silverware, dirty table, food was average and very over priced.  Most likely won't ever go back unless I'm invited by another party.  Service was average, credit card machine was not working.  When we were seated, table was not clean at all, my silverware had a grain of rice on the fork, which shows it was not cleaned very well, our table still had the check on the table from the previous customers.  When we were handed our menus, they were all greasy and dirty.  Our hands were greasy and dirty after looking over the menu.  Just to be clear, I'm a very very patient person & tolerate almost anything without complaining when it comes to normal human error or has an understanding, I'm not the type to expect a red carpet rolled out BUT if Cheesecake is going to charge for there ridiculously overpriced food, I expect better then average service.  Olive Garden down the street has way better table preparation and  cleanliness.  I asked the waiter to have someone come clean our table as it has all these crumbs on it - well no one ever showed up.  I think the staff is getting lazy and just because it's ""Cheesecake Factory"", the expectation is to deal with it.  I think if your restaurant wants to have the responsibility of having customers pay more than normal prices, customer should expect better than normal service.  Again, I don't recommend this location to anyone and you should do yourself a favor and save your money and go down the street to Olive Garden and pay half the price and get better service!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=200
D L.,"Houston, United States",4,35,8,1.0,18/12/2012,"If you're a fan of fine dining, good food and cleanliness then the Baybrook location of The Cheesecake Factory is most definatly NOT for you, if you're a fan of disgusting food being described as ""Cajun"" and the tartest strawberry lemonade around then look no futher. I had been to the Galleria location of The Cheesecake factory a few years back and every time I heard someone talk about The Cheesecake Factory I had a problem remembering if I enjoyed the food or not which should have been my 1st clue, but since it wasn't clear to me I decided to give the newly open Baybrook Mall location a shot. I knew I probably hadn't made the wisest decision  as soon as I was seated because the way the table was set, because at ""The Cheesecake Factory"" they sit all of your silverware directly on the table... Now let's pause for a minute and give that a second to set in... Yes ladies and gentlemen they set the utensils that you use to pick up food that's going in your mouth directly on the table. That same table that the bus boy just came by and wiped with the same rag that he used to wipe the other 39 tables in the dining area, can you say unsanitary? Not to mention there were residual crumbs of something still left on the table. Even Jim-Bob's BBQ knows to at least wrap the utensils in a paper towel.  So immediately my girlfriend and I asked for silverware that hadn't been placed on the table, and what's the 1st thing our waitress does when she brings them? Tries to sit them back on the same dirty table(yes I am shaking my head too right now). So anyway we order the ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"", Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes, and two lemonades one strawberry and the other one regular. So the waitress brings out the lemonades and they are tartest lemonades I've ever had in my life. I guess when life gave The Cheesecake Factory lemons they squeezed them directly in a glass and served them to their customers. They must've had some idea of how tart the lemonade was because they put sugar around the rim of the glass which gave the lemonade all the class of boxed wine. And that's not all I haven't even started on the food yet. The ""Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"" didn't have a sauce it had more of an oil with tablespoon upon tablespoon of black pepper ugh. The chicken was so charred it taste like I was licking a BBQ grill not to mention it had 6 of the tiniest shrimp I've ever seen in a shrimp pasta dish ever. The Fettuccini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes was lifeless and the White Chocolate Rasberry Truffle Cheesecake was one dimensional  .

Being a friday afternoon we knew it would be busy and decided just to order take out. i called and was placed on hold for 15 minutes before someone finally took my order. That should have told me what was about to follow.      I ordered a burger medium rare and it was well done. The bun was soak through soggy.  The fries were soggy too.  I ordered onion rings as well and that failed to make it in the bag even though i was charged for it. My wife ordered a chicken pasta dish and you literally had to search for chicken. It was like an alfredo sauce and it was clumpy even after being reheated. I called to give feedback about our experience and again 10 minute wait for a manager to get on phone. If i was a manager and had customer complaint on the phone I'm making that a priority getting right to it. Its like they don't care. Just from my negative experience and talking to friends and family, there have been 20 or more people that changed their mind and took their business somewhere else.

Then it took 45 minutes for 3 plates of food to come out. My desert took another 45 minutes. We didn't even bother to get another round of drinks. We all were waiters and understand it gets hectic but we were the only table that the waitress had. The manager said he would take care of us but it never happened.

I get that CF is always super busy.  But don't tell your customers food will be ready and then make them wait 30 minutes.  We will never do do take out from there again.  (Plus, to be honest, by the time I got it home - it was warm, but certainly not hot - or enjoyable - and for $43... yah, I'll pass.)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=20

My kiddo had a bacon hamburger with all the fixin's, my husband had tacos and I had the chicken and biscuits. My husband's meal was ok. He didn't get a choice of sides and it came with rice/beans. He did order a margarita and was very pleased by that. My son loved his hamburger and I was ultimately satisfied with my meal.

I also enjoy the hot, fresh bread brought out to enjoy as you look at their massive menu. I have had a variety of salads, sandwiches, chicken dishes, pork chops, meat loaf, pasta, fish, and LOVE their Brioche French Toast and bacon served during their Sunday brunch. My last meal there was a Bacon, Bacon Burger that was truly one of the best burgers I have ever had. I'd like to close with a tip - The Cheesecake Factory now has an app you can down load that gives you a code to give to your server so you can see your tab and pay when you are ready to go rather than wait for a check.

The patio looked like a nice place to sit for an evening meal. The three stars is mainly for the food quality. Everyone in our party felt their food was just so-so. The portions were huge and presentation was okay, but there was always some key element missing. I got the French country salad from the skinny menu (one of maybe four things I saw that were vegetarian entrees, no vegan items seen though I wasn't looking really close) and though it was massive, it was mainly greens. Very little goat cheese or beets. Only a few asparagus. There were a decent amount of candied pecans, but with pecans and greens and very little of everything else, it was just boring. For a $10.50 salad with 5 ingredients that aren't meat, I expect more. Another person got the chicken Marsala which tasted great but was mostly noodles and not enough sauce for the noodle portion. Spaghetti and meatballs were dry and needed more sauce to balance the massive noodle portion. Chicken club sandwich was huge, but bland. The pepperoni pizza was okay, though big, but nothing to write home about. Our server was great and we had lots of people asking us if we needed anything. Drinks were filled as needed. No complaints on service at all.

The service was not a problem at all, it's the quality of food.  We started off by ordering the factory nachos and at first glance it looked amazing. The plate was huge and the presentation was on point. As we began chipping away at the iceberg we noticed the cheese to be a little gritty and the chips to be super greasy. You get that feeling of ""blah"" in your mouth and don't want to eat anymore.  For the main course I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce and fries. I wasn't really impressed with the sandwich because the chicken seemed to have a lot of breading on it and it was also a little too greasy. The flavor was not what I expected and I had to ask the waitress if they forgot to add buffalo sauce on it. She told me the sauce is ""drizzled"" on the sandwich and got me a little extra.  We didn't want to even bother ordering any cheesecake because the thought of grease and dairy churning in your gut while doing some shopping at the mall didn't sound very pleasant.

First it didn't come with prosciutto as it stated in the menu, second the arugla salad on top was either old or had been stored in a plastic sack for an extended period of time.

My battered shrimp came out stuck together and when I separated it, I tasted raw batter between the two pieces of shrimp. I sent the dish back. Travis got a Caesar salad for me to eat while I waited for them to re-cook my dish. Travis, our waiter was wonderful!!! I really excited when I saw him bringing my pasta dish to my table (for the second time). I soon found out that the cooks just took my shrimp and cooked it well done.

April J.,"Houston, United States",24,9,7,1.0,15/6/2016,"This cheesecake factory has the worst customer service. Ive gone here several time since I suffer from gluten issues and it seems every time I go something goes wrong. The first time I got a burger medium well and the meat was still raw. After explaining nicely to the manager that I would just like to get a cooked burger and was willing to drive back, he argued saying that a medium to medium well has pink on the inside and it was fine. I eat my steaks usually rare, I don't mind pink in the middle, what I do mind is getting a burger and it being raw. Finally after seeing the raw meat he apologized and said yes this was completely undercooked. Took care of my meal and I was fine with that. Even after being given a RAW burger, I still have gone back numerous times. I usually ask for my sauces on the side and they get that right about 15% of the time, but I'm not too picky, I suck it up and eat it with no problem. However, tonight, I wanted a gf bun. My husband gets home with it and it's wrapped in lettuce. Well, if I wanted a lettuce wrapped burger I would have gotten that anywhere. My husband called back and asked, nicely, if he could just bring it back and get a gf bun, the to go lady told him she was aware she gave him a lettuce burger and was rather rude on the phone. He asked to speak to a manger thinking maybe she didn't know. I live about 15 min. Away and it took the manager that long to pick up the phone. Once my husband got there they still were unsure why it was given like that. Finally after waiting they decided to tell him they ran out. Why couldn't the to go lady mention that. Maybe she didn't know, understandable, but for the manager to be so busy he couldn't listen to a customer request until he was already there is rather annoying. So now we had to get the whole meal replaced because his food was cold and gross and all the manager could do was comp mt burger and a free cheesecake? Honestly, I liked going here because of the gluten free options, but after being screwed over so many times I think it's time to move on. Luckily more restaurants, even nearby ones, are having more options for people with food allergies so I will start taking my business somewhere else, where my food will be cooked, managers won't argue and actually care about their job. It's not that hard. They really need to reevaluate how they mange that place.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=120

Here is a tip, the company usually offers up two free cheesecake slices with a $25 gift card purchase around Christmas time.

Austin T.,"Friendswood, United States",3,14,26,3.0,10/1/2018,"First off, I have to say that this is much better than the PF Changs across the parking lot. That said, there are still some problems that need to be addressed. One of which, being the price. It's a bit pricey, so don't be surprised when your check comes out to more than $60. Second, the parking space is just terrible. It definitely does not service the amount of people coming into Pf Changs AND The Cheesecake Factory.  However, there are some good things about the restaurant as well.  I highly suggest ordering off of the happy hour menu, because it has a decent selection of foods that will leave you more than full. Second, the service was pretty great. I felt like the staff was actually interested in what I had to say, and the staff was very helpful.  Finally, I must discuss the restroom situation. Apparently, The Cheesecake Factory thinks that a dark closet with blaring music is the equivalent of a restroom. It is definitely not!

Jose G.,"Houston, United States",3,18,16,1.0,5/1/2018,"Just terrible.  Took the wife and kids out to dinner and it's was disappointing to say the least. $7 for a quesadilla with very little cheese, literally like 50 cents worth of ingredients (tortillas and cheese, no sides) . My wife had the California avocado salad and it looked old and composed of less than fresh vegetables. She said it was terrible, only had a few bites.  My son and the corn dog meal it was surprisingly better than expected.  I ordered a hopadillo  beer and they were out , I ordered the classic burger but requested fresh or raw onions in place of the ""grilled onions"". My food comes out about 10-15 minutes after everyone else's, I have to wait for the less than stellar (but friendly) waiter to bring condiments because apparently I'm the only one that eats a burger with mayo and mustard. As I'm fixing my burger I notice a giant slab of ""grilled onions"" (1/4 of an entire onion), I remind the waiter I orders raw onions which I confirmed he understood when he took the order, he basically calls me a liar but offers to get raw onions. He brings the onions and I notice they have me cabbage instead of lettuce, who eats a burger with cabbage? The biggest offense of all, I ordered my burger cooked medium, after all the other stuff they screwed up, I decide to check. It was cooked well past well done. I politely requested to send it back and cancel my order, the waiter was nice and took it back, even offered to let me keep the fries as a conciliation prize. He says he will send the manager over.  The manager comes over and is clueless, tells me they're out of lettuce and fresh onions, etc. then asks if my burger was under or over cooked. I decline to re order, since my family already ate their food and they managed to mess up a ""classic burger"" so bad, I don't think I can ever go back to this place.

So they were seated first and we were told that if we wanted a table it could be a very long time. We sqeezed uncomfortably into a booth.  One by one we excused ourselves to use the restroom and wash our hands. First, who has two stalls for a place that holds that many people. There was a line going out the door. Second the ladies room had not been attended to in a long time. One stall was out of toilet paper in the holders and the people were using a roll off the floor. In the second stall which I'll post a pic of, it was just about to be the same. All the trashcans were packed and overflowing. There were no papertowls to dry your hands... my dad came out and said that the mens room didn't have running water. He told a manager, but the manager could care less. So my dad had to eat with soap on his hands.  Things finally got better when our food came.

We told Travis we were cutting back on carbs and he immediately showed us several things we could choose from.  We were starving so we decided to get the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap appetizer. It comes with romaine lettuce leaves and a bowl of the mushroom chicken teriyaki tasting mixture to make your own wraps. It was very delicious.  My boyfriend decided to get the bacon cheese spinach omelette. Yea they serve omelettes all day!  It normally comes with fried potatoes and toast, but the waiter offered tomatoes and fruit salad to substitute. It was really good! Definitely worth coming for breakfast/lunch/dinner for!  I had the steak medallions on the skinnylicious menu. It normally comes as steak medallions with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies with a Madeira sauce. I believe it was in the 590 calories or less section. I already know that their mashed potatoes are delicious but not today  :'''( Travis suggested cooked spinach as a substitute and it went perfectly with the meal. Best part for my fellow keto-ers.

Tonys M.,"Houston, United States",4,10,3,2.0,10/10/2017,"Each time we go to this location, I get the Cobb Salad. Today, I was very disappointed in their ""new"" version of a smaller Cobb Salad which included purple cabbage and a very small amount of shredded chicken. The waitress and the manager said they were re-working some of their recipes and the Cobb Salad is included. There was nothing on the menu stating the salad was now made with purple cabbage. A Cobb Salad is typically made with chopped salad greens (iceberg lettuce and Romaine lettuce), crisp bacon,  grilled  chicken breast, hard-boiled eggs, avocado, and dressing. Putting purple cabbage in the salad and decreasing the size makes it look like the restaurant is trying to save money by adding a cheap cabbage filler. Since most of the food in this restaurant is marginal, I will go some place that is not trying to keep the costs low by altering their recipes. Not happy with my experience.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40
Mrs. D.,"Houston, United States",0,4,,1.0,9/10/2017,This review is not about their food. It's about the lack of kindness to a customer who was choking at their resturant. We observed a customer choking on 10/07/17. He was obvisoluy in distress and his family was trying to help but were unable. They had two toddlers and the wife was attempting to help him. There were several Cheescake employees that just stood there and offered no kind of help. I asked them to get a manager but no one did. The gentleman walked outside and by the grace of God was able to dislodge whatever he was choking on. The paramedics did show up after a while (the wife called 911) but the Cheesecake manager nor any of the employees came out to check on him. I was very disheartened to witness all this from The Cheesecake Factory.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40
N. N.,"Clear Lake, Houston, United States",0,27,12,1.0,19/11/2017,"We are huge Cheesecake Factory fans. It is our place for any celebration that we have, birthdays, Mother Day, Father Day etc... there are always minor complaints in my visits to this location, but yesterday was above acceptable. We went last night to celebrate my birthday. We were party of 9 including kids. We sit outside, and it was very windy, and they didn't have curtains to block the winds. Our waiter was a nice guy, but he might got busy, so another girl brought our food. She throw our food on the floor, which was half of the egg rolls appetizer, we complained about it, so she went and brought two pieces of egg rolls in a small bowl. I asked to talk to the manger which he started arguing with my husband that we lost two pieces, and these are your two pieces. I step in, and i told that rude manager that our problem is not how many pieces we had lost, it is about how they served it to us  in a bowl, instead of a plate with its dressing and rice noodles. I left without even eating cheese cake for my birthday. Never again. There are other cheese cake factory locations that have nicer employees and managers.

Kayla N.,"Houston, United States",91,300,2442,2.0,23/2/2015,Very disappointed in this place tonight.  The beet and goat cheese salad was extremely salty.  Mini crab bites were barely warm and greasy dynamite shrimps. We wanted to go here for some cheesecake since we ate a light dinner already but ended up ordering these appetizers.  Bad decision! At least the cheesecakes were decent. Not sure if I will come back to this location again.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40
A T.,"Clear Lake, Houston, United States",29,112,373,3.0,21/12/2015,"We arrived here at 6pm on a Saturday evening. That is probably the best time to arrive, and anymore after that, you will be looking at a very long time. Our party of 5 was seated promptly--just the location was awkward because we were seated near the door to the outside seating and whenever the door was opened, freezing air came through. I suppose this isn't a problem all year round.  Our server was an attentive lady and gave us supple time to decide on our orders. We were given the complimentary bread and we also asked for olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Our starter was the eggroll sampler. It included the Crispy Cuban, the avocado, Firecracker salmon, and the Tex-Mex. It came with 4 different sauces that I think complimented each kind of eggroll nicely, however you paired it. I liked the tamarind-cashew sauce the best.  I opted for appetizers as my main course. I had the pear and bleu cheese flatbread pizza and the ahi tartare. The flatbread is very small, but coupled with the complimentary bread, the eggrolls, my other meal, and forking off of my sister's plate--it overall makes a filling dinner. The pizza has really nice flavour, btw. Pear and bleu cheese go so very well together. Highly recommend it! The tartare on the other hand... suuuupeeeerrrbbblyy--wait for it--SUBPAR. It was drenched in soy sauce which completely drowned the fresh flavour it's supposed to have. It came with 4 small crisps which did not do any justice. Bleh bleh.  My sister had the Eveleyn's Favourite Pasta--waitress points out it's a vegetarian dish as a reminder--and it tasted alright, as well. Not in love with it, but it had nice, smoky flavours with a kick from the seasonings. She just didn't like the super al dente state of the rigatoni.   My mom had the almond crusted salmon salad. She said it was pretty good. The vinaigrette coupled it well.  My dad had the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta--he said it was a little spicy but it being jambalaya, well, he had to shut it. He enjoyed it, though.  My brother had the lemon-herb chicken which came with mashed potatoes and carrots. It's a big serving and we had leftovers to scarf home.  For dessert, we went for two items: I chose the limoncello cake and my mom went for the mango-key lime cheesecake. Let me tell you... I felt like a fata** after forking those desserts down. The limoncello was sweet but the cake part of it was a nice equal. Big slice of it, too.  The mango-key lime cheesecake was delicious. It paired sooo well; our forks were fending each other off from the last slice.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory as a chain restaurant does try to hold its name. Expect that this place is packed. From sitting to leaving, it took 2 and 1/2hrs... a lot of waiting, but if you've got good enough company and patience, then yes, I recommend a visit.  Just had one extra problem: one of our menus had spaghetti stuck between the pages. Yuck.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40
Melissa G.,"Seabrook, United States",53,29,44,4.0,15/11/2015,"This is my third trip to this particular Cheesecake Factory...so that must be good sign!  I was thrilled that they were opening one up at Baybrook Mall since the closest one's were the Galleria or the Woodlands.  30-50 mile trips are not on my to do list.  I have personally had their Spaghetti and meatballs, the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, the Steak Diane, the Grilled Chicken Club w/ fries (which were excellent!) and the Fish Tacos.  Everything has been very good!  The Cheesecake Factory has put together a menu that is filled with colorful and flavorful foods.  There is something for everyone on their huge menu.  Others in my party ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, the Grilled Pork Chop and the Fettuccini Alfredo.  They all looked incredible!  Homemade apple sauce with chunks of apple accompanied the Grilled Pork Chop....and the comment was made that it was better than Perry's!  As far as the Cheesecake goes.....INCREDIBLE!  I have had the Vanilla Bean, the Banana Cream (tastes just like heavenly banana pudding), and tonight, the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake.  I always get mine to go so I can enjoy it at home.  I do not share these wonderful pieces of heaven!  I would give 5 stars for food, 5 stars for service,  but have to give 3 for the price of their food.  The Cheesecake is reasonably priced, but the food menu is a bit steep.   I highly recommend all of the things that I have tried.  Out of them all, I would have to say my favorite was the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  I plan to try the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp on my next visit because it looked delicious with the plantains, black beans, mango salsa and rice.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40

Tanya C.,"Bacliff, United States",0,31,14,1.0,30/6/2016,"My husband and I are a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, just NOT this location. They skimp out on everything possible and service is hit or miss. I have been to Cheesecake Factory about 50x in 5 different locations and never had a problem at any other location. I have been here 4x and had a problem 3x already. I guess I can't blame anyone but myself for returning, but this will be the last.  1st time: The warm crab & artichoke dip tasted different and I finally figured out why after 5 minutes....they added pieces of bread in the dip. I ended up returning it and the manager agreed there was bread in there and the texture of the dip didn't look normal. He did take it off the bill but I was so upset because I dined there that night because I was craving the dip. The entree was fine and service was just ok. 2nd time: I ordered the Thai lettuce wrap and the chicken strip were much smaller than usual but I didn't say anything. Service was horrible this time. We just left unhappy. 3rd time: Like a dummy I returned because I was craving the Thai lettuce wrap. The closest cheesecake factory is in the galleria area and too far to drive during rush hour. So I settled. They said they ran out of Thai lettuce wraps (not sure how a restaurant can run out of chicken and lettuce). I ended up ordering miso salmon.  It was good and the waitress was great. I had a pleasant dine in experience, finally! 4th time: Today I went with my family and I ordered the steak medallion for my mother. It did not look like the picture on the website or their screen display at all! I understand it's a small portion since it's on the skinnylicious menu but the picture in the website is the skinnylicious steak medallion since there is no other steak medallion on the full entree menu. There were 4 pieces of steak the size of a quarter each. All 4 pieces together was not even 1/4 of the picture.  Anyway I asked for the waiteaitress and her and another waitress agreed that it did not look like the picture. The manager came over and said well there's nothing he can do since he didn't see how it came out. I told him this is exactly how it came out since my mom never cutted into any of the meat, she used a fork to pick at the veggies. I didn't like how he insinuated that she had cut and ate into it already. She was eating the veggies cause she was hungry and it took him over 5 minutes to come over. My mom didn't want any trouble so she said it was fine and continued eating.  When she began eating the steak she said it tasted more like lamb than beef and I insisted it might just be the seasoning. She didnt want it anymore and was picking at the veggies only.  So I tried it and agreed it tasted like lamb. I asked the waitress to return it. The bill came and it wasn't taken off. The waitress said she would go ask another manager. David came and he did agree to take it off. He was much more pleasant to speak to and actually took the time to listen to our comments unlike the other manager. The waitress was wonderful and did whatever she could to make us happy.  In addition,  my husband didn't tell me until we got home that his steak tasted well done instead of medium like he ordered.  The outter layer was bitter due to being burnt. All in all, I feel like this location is not consistent and not up to Cheesecake Factory standards. There cheesecake however has always been consistent,  but you can't really screw up defrosting frozen cheesecake.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=40

The waitstaff is almost always very friendly. I would recommend going early on a weekend because the wait can be very long. We usually order off the Skinnylicious menu. We love the Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella Flatbread Pizza. It's very tasty! You'd never know it was considered ""skinnylicious."" We are also absolutely addicted to their Strawberry Shortcake. It is truly HEAVEN! It's a warm, homemade sugared biscuit with vanilla ice cream in between along with fresh strawberries and loads of whipped cream. It's to die for! We'd much rather order this instead of a piece of cheesecake.  Now that it's Fall, I was super excited to order the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake. I look forward to ordering this flavor every year but I have to say it wasn't as decadent as I remember. It's like eating half pecan pie and half pumpkin pie with lots of whipped cream.

I definitely do not recommend the frozen margarita. It was like drinking frozen water the only flavor we could taste was the lime we squeezed the straw in to. I have to say they do have the best veggie burger I have ever had but was disappointed that instead of lettuce on both burgers we ordered we got cabbage shreds instead. We mentioned both of these concerns with our waitress but all she said was that's why she doesn't recommend the frozen margarita (when ordering she informed us they do not have a machine) as it is hand blended and that they use a lettuce blend so it would have cabbage. However I don't understand that as the description on menus does state lettuce on their burgers not cabbage.

This is probably not like any french toast you have ever had, this is BRULÉED FRENCH TOAST! They soak the bread in a wonderful creamy custard (I heard this is done overnight,but I have not verified that info) and then grilled; not baked or fried, GRILLED until the outside has a perfect crunch. I suggest you add bacon because these two belong together, the sweet and smoky flavors compliment each other. OH MY the syrup - sweet and buttery, simply Awwwwww Goodddddd!! The coffee is usually perfect; occasionally it comes out too weak/watery, but if you ask them to bring you a real cup of coffee they will do so without question.

Ken H.,"Houston, United States",38,231,1177,3.0,23/2/2015,"This is a hard choice between the food that was good and the accommodations not so much. First, the good.  We ordered the lunch meatloaf and it wasn't good it was superb.  The server was friendly and attentive enough (though less than stellar). Now, the bad.  For a place with this physical grandeur the accommodations were not good.  I went to the restroom to wash my hands.  The foam soap was thin/watered.  I wasn't able to get a lather and barely able to get a skim of soap on my hands.  Like McDonald's they have blow dryers instead of paper. Unlike McDonald's, you have to stick your hands into their dryer device.  I wasn't able to hold hands still enough to avoid wiping them on the sides of the thing, so I wasn't sure I was better off than when I came in.   Finally, they have no WiFi.  Very tall ceilings with grand chandlers but no WiFi. ==================== Note to somebody:  This is weird but they had so many choices of what sounded like wonderful cheesecakes I was unable to choose one. We were going to get it to go and some of the choices sounded so delicious I knew if I made the wrong choice I'd be upset and self-flagellating for choosing the wrong one instead of one of the other grand sounding choices. The only solution was to not get any. I guess it's a damn good thing I chose the right wife. UPDATE:  Went for the second time in more than three years.  Meatloaf was still good, but the service was bad.  There were many empty tables.  In our area I could only see three other occupied tables and at least two of these had already been served when we arrived.  Obviously meatloaf is already prepared but it took 15-20 minutes to get it.  We could have snacked on bread but it didn't arrive until about a minute before the food. Our server was inattentive.  It was not a good experience.  I'm docking them one star.  If it weren't for the meatloaf it would have been two stars. ___ We've Eaten Out Every Meal for 25 years",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=60

Wendy L.,"Pearland, United States",54,9,1,2.0,23/6/2016,"I visited on Father's Day and surprising got a table for 6 within a few minutes which was nice. We started with the Avocado Eggrolls which were nice and crispy on the outside yet the avocado was still chuncky and creamy inside. The dipping sauce was overly sweet and not necessary for my taste. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta as my entree. The shrimp were tail on with a light fry to them and while the menu did say the sauce had wine and basil in it, I found it too overwhelming to eat as did a guest of mine who tried it. I settled for the bread basket (which had a nice chewy baguette) and my Wild Turkey and Coke. The Red Velvet Cheesecake was divine as always and 1 slice had plenty left to take home.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=60

Shelly M.,"League City, United States",0,128,43,4.0,7/10/2015,The Cheesecake Factory has awesome food that's always consistently good and they have such a huge variety of choices including a skinnylicious menu for calorie counters which is definitely a bonus! The staff at this location is always so nice and professional especially Kristen T she's awesome and so sweet. The only thing they could improve on is the cramped seating and very uncomfortable plastic  or wicker like flimsy chairs inside. I get that type of chair outside but not inside.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=60
Katrina H.,"League City, United States",0,5,,2.0,11/8/2016,I have to say that the wait time and overall customer service is pretty terrible. Our party of 6 arrived around 3pm following a graduation. We waiting more than 25 mins for seating despite the fact that the resturant was half empty and patrons were leaving. We were told after 15 mins of unexplained waiting it was due to staffing. The hostess seemed inept and overwhelmed by a vey basic job. We eventually get seated I a seat and section that was available the entire time!?!? Mindless and same staff as when we arrived.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=60
Jon H.,"Pearland, United States",39,15,1,2.0,21/3/2016,"I have to keep asking myself why I keep coming back here giving this place so many chances to improve. It seems my dining experience decreases with every visit I make here, never improving on the many flaws it shows. You want to talk about over-rated, Cheesecake Factory takes the proverbial (cheese?) cake for that unwanted award.  Atmosphere: For a chain restaurant, the atmosphere is pretty decent for the layout. It's undeniable that this place is a popular dinner venue given the crowded capacity at night and the noise level it brings, but that doesn't appeal very much to me. Wait times vary, but most of the times I have visited it has usually been a 30 minute wait at minimum.  Service: Hit-and-miss at times, leaning more towards the lacking side of it. Sometimes you get waiters/waitresses that bend over backwards for their customers, while some don't look like they even want to be there (and poorly affecting the service quite a bit). This time around the service was decent, nothing too special but the waiter was doing his job well enough. Food: What a horrible mistake I make every time wanting to try different things the menu has to offer. They have a big menu, but it seems that every time I try something new the quality of the food goes downhill from there. Tonight was no exception, I ordered the Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms while my fiance had Miso-Glazed Salmon over rice. This dish I had gotten ranks as one of the worst dishes I have ever had, border-line inedible. The Chicken Marsala was almost tasteless, but even worse the little flavor it did have was strange and repugnant. The mushrooms, coated with the supposed ""Marsala"" around it was a disaster. The bow tie pasta resting underneath it while tender was completely bland and tasteless. I would assume they were hoping the Marsala sauce would be a good substitute for seasoning, but the sauce was already disgusting to begin with. For the first time in a while I reached over for the salt at the end of the table to somehow salvage this mess of this dish, but there was no salvaging this shipwreck of a plate. I couldn't come to finish it, I was severely disappointed with what I had ordered. My fiance's food wasn't any better, the salmon lacked any real glaze on top, and even worse the salmon itself was extremely dry and flaked in wadded chunks of culinary disaster. Our food was horrible, this was one of the worst meals I have ever had. We had cheesecake afterwards of course, but that didn't save the meal experience for us.  Conclusion: This place should honestly just stick to it's own name and make cheesecake, because that seems to be the only redeeming quality of this chain restaurant. While some of the food here has been decent to alright at best in the past (and that's being generous with my critique), the food served tonight was inexcusable. There's no saving this sinking ship unless they do a complete overhaul o their food and go back to the drawing board. Utterly disappointed, there is absolutely no way I could recommend this restaurant to anyone I know. Save your money, and pick a better restaurant in the Baybrook Mall area. There are way better options out there.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=100
Chris B.,"League City, United States",0,16,5,1.0,18/5/2016,I ordered the fish tacos and unfortunately they were drowning in whatever sweet sauce they use. Couldn't even taste the fish it was that heavy. The rice that accompanied the tacos was bland and flavor was nonexistent. Black beans tasted days old and were on the dried out side. Manager never even came out to understand why or to try and resolve the issue. I also noticed there prices on the menu don't match up with the Wiley of the food your getting.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=100

I have been here several times and EVERY time I'm here, the floors are slippery and filthy with food! It's like they let a room full of 5 year olds loose and they had a mega-fun food fight! GROSS!

Jolynn G.,"League City, United States",200,24,29,1.0,14/2/2016,"I visit this location about once a month and can tell you almost every other visit I  have to ask for clean silverware that doesn't have stuck on it.. Gross! Also, if you sit in the patio area the seats nearly always have bird poop on them and the staff only wipes it down if you are the one to ask for it to be cleaned. My final straw with this company was yesterday when I was sitting out on the patio with my kids and surrounded by other families, there was a large table with ladies and a few men and children and this table had way too many drinks. I am all down for having a great time and understand when it's a large group it always tends to get a little loud and that's expected, but when it's drunks screaming over each other for over and hour and the drinks keep coming that's when it's a bit obsessive! Every table around me was staring at them and shaking their head and dropping their waiters hints but not once did the staff do anything about it. I finally asked to speak with the manager and he basically looked at me like I was the crazy one for saying something. He actually went over to their table and almost reinforced their behavior so not sure what he said to them because they only got louder. I then asked for the general manager and he was a little more helpful, and even agreed the screaming over each other nonstop was excessive. However in today's society he was too afraid to ask them to at least tone it down or cut them off since they would be driving and had children, due to the fact that he might get sued.. Really.. Are you kidding me. What about the entire restaurant being disturbed by this one table. He said it was the same as a screaming child scenario. If I wanted a bar atmosphere for my children to be exposed to I would have taken them to a bar.. Not what I thought was a family restaurant. It was the worse experience and actually didn't even finish our food nor enjoy it we ended up leaving with a merely 25% credit. What a waste of money and time!

The Crispy Crab Bites packed a lot of taste for their small size, don't be fooled. The Portabella Mushroom, Avocado & Zucchini fries were lightly breaded and also tasty. The Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls were my least favorite item. The asparagus, mushrooms, cilantro and shrimp were good but there were far too many rice noodles.

Sabrina F.,"Houston, United States",2,10,15,2.0,10/10/2015,"Went here for my birthday and was not impressed. The restaurant was packed and extremely loud, the ambiance in general was very overwhelming and made me feel uncomfortable with all the people and staff constantly in the way and running around. The food was not great the best thing I ordered was the red velvet cheesecake which was kinda on the sweet side. The fried mac and cheese are always talked about and regarded as amazing but I don't know if it's me or that specific dish but the cheese was a little gross and the texture was bad does not live up to its hype, but the worst thing about this restaurant has to be the fact that in the women's restroom there is only two stalls..... how does a large restaurant that is always crowded only have two stalls it's unbelievable. I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the free bread is good, the waiter was nice and easy going as well as very helpful and was quick to fix any mistakes or replace unwanted meals also the cheesecake was alright. But seriously this restaurant is all hype and not worth going unless you have a gift card but then in that case just take a cheesecake to go and avoid eating the food or sitting in the restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=100

Went back again and had the fish and chips...delightful...so crispy and tender and flavorful!  Got two orders of fried cheese this time as the first visit...they were so awesome.  Also got the same cake again....nothing but goodness!!  They had a line out the door waiting but we were able to get a table in the bar area and skip the wait!  Love, love this place!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-friendswood-3?start=100
