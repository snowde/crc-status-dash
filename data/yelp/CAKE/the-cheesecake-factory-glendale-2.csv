Gia K.,"Escondido, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/30/2017,A hidden gem! Just made a quick stop here for an appetizer after I picked up my daughter at the end of her prom as I wasn't super hungry so I had the chicken taquitos along with a raspberry lemonade and I wasn't disappointed. The food here is always on point and the ambiance is always lively at any of their locations!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=80
Ruby S.,"Glendale, CA",140,335,385,1.0,7/31/2017,Never will we EVER return to this Cheesecake Factory. The parking sucks. The people suck. The food sucks. The prices suck. The service suck. Everything is just horrible. Regardless of the day or time you will have to wait even if there are tables open. They always stick us in this tiny corner by the wall with chairs which SUCK and are very uncomfortable. We came here last week again to give it 1 last shot and it was completely horrifying. My girlfriend got the steak and ordered it medium well with potatoes. Her steak came out so well done it was super hard and black. She had a very hard time cutting it and she was chewing it as if they left it on the stove for 30 min. My orange chicken was okay but the rice itself wasn't fully cooked and tasted very starchy. We told our waiter and he apologized and took it back. We had to ask a different waiter for water because our server was so slow to return and it wasn't very busy either it was on a weekday. 25 min went by and no steak. He said they were cooking it as fast as they could...now I don't know about you but I can cook a steak on my tiny BBQ with 1 single propane tank in about 10 minutes especially how thin it was. The man returned after and still no steak and offered her a salad/soup. She asked for a salad and they brought her a tiny garden salad that was OLD!!! The leaves were stale and turning purple and tasted gross!!!  Another 10 minutes went by and by that time she had finished the orange chicken with me and her steak came. It was cooked great this time and the potatoes tasted fresh. We waited for our check for so long. He did not offer to take off any items or to discount anything and there was not a manager in site. Horrible customer service. We even ordered a cheesecake to go and even that wasn't on the house.... he charged us for 2 steaks since they had to make 2 and he had to have his manager take off 1 so we still payed for the steak. The best thing about this place was the free bread. That's pretty sad.....and even the white bread was super old and hard just the black ones were great. We will never return here and I was so embarrassed to take my girl here. We were here a total of 2.5hrs for a steak and orange chicken and we ordered waters.... HORRIBLE!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=80
Robert G.,"Glendale, CA",0,9,1,3.0,12/5/2017,"Considering it's in Americana, there is always at least a 30 minute wait anytime past 6PM. Huge portions, average quality, average price.

Reneh M.,"Glendale, CA",57,8,,5.0,1/3/2018,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The  variety of food here is amazing, starting from salads, pastas, burgers, sandwiches, etc. Every time I've came here my waiter/waitress has treated me in such good manner. I always get the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and it's amazing!  Also my go to appetizer is the avocado egg rolls, they are so delicious.

Minsky C.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Pre ordered a whole truffle tower chocolate cake that my daughter requested for her bday Party. Ordered it yesterday for pick up today. Went to pick it up at 5:30 today and the cashier said they didnt have the cake. It was for my daughter's 15th bday and New Years Eve party. Spoke to the manager who was useless, unprofessional and unapologetic. Didn't even make an effort to call other locations to check availability. All he said pretty much is that the order taker messed up... oh really? Did she? Like I said , USELESS. I called other locations and Had to drive all the way to Arcadia to get one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=80
Elina T.,"Glendale, CA",0,51,66,3.0,9/11/2017,"I was craving cheesecake today so I decided to come here, especially since I hadn't been here for few months. Wait was just 30 minutes so it wasn't bad. I used to enjoy this place a lot more. Now, no matter what I eat it tastes okay and it's nothing special for the amount you pay. I had the Cajun jambalaya with chicken on the side. They literally put 4 pieces of shrimp in my pasta. If I'm paying $20 for pasta I expect few more shrimps and not just plain pasta with spices. I also got their strawberry cheesecake and even though I was craving that cheesecake, it didn't hit the spot. I think I would have enjoyed it more if the cheesecake was kept at a cooler temp. My fiancé got chicken lettuce wrap and he didn't like it due to the little amounts of chicken they put in it. This used to be one of my favorite places to eat but not anymore. Everything about this place is average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=80

Giulianna G.,"Torrance, CA",2,71,54,3.0,2/5/2017,"We went this Sunday and it was pretty busy. We were seated within 25 minutes which wasn't too bad. We ordered the super antioxidant salad with chicken added , falafel salad, grilled fish tacos, and carrot cake.  I can honestly say that the salads were delicious and healthy. The service was not that great. It took the server a long time to even bring us water or bread. In the middle of the dessert we got the bill. I don't think it is proper to give customers the check mid grub.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=80
Agatha B.,"Glendale, CA",9,34,,5.0,11/9/2017,Always a crazy wait but always worth it too. Everything I come to Cheesecake Factory I enjoy myself. For me it's not about how long I wait but the overall experience instead. I love the happy hour from 4-6 amazing deals. My favorite is the Buffalo blasts from the happy hour menu only 5 dollars and huge portions. When I go for dinner I love the Louisiana pasta which has a hint of spice but also so good with the bow tie pasta. You get to walk around Americana during the wait so it's not so bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=80

I love the bar area, best place to go when you don't want to wait for a table. Customer Service isn't  bad, considering that there are so many patrons there. Our waitress was awesome because she was able to get us our drinks and tab quick. We told her we were trying to catch our movie, but not without a drink first.

I love their chipotle chicken pasta, Chinese chicken salad, steak Dian, and their cheesecakes are amazing!!! If you're looking for a nice dinner with a large group I definitely recommend going here. The only negative thing is that there usually is a long wait so be prepared.

Kevin L.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",90,12,12,3.0,7/24/2017,"As a regular, I know how busy it can get on the weekends especially on Sundays. But here is one of my lowest experiences dining here. Wait time was short, surprisingly. 15-20 minutes for a table of 3. We followed the hostess to our table and was seated, then assuming our waitress comes and already asks for our drinks without giving us some time. Didn't give us a name, which would of been nice.  While looking at the menu she comes back and takes our drink orders. Comes back with them and see if we're ready to order. My little brother already knew his order so he ordered first while we continued to look at the menu. Suddenly another waiter comes and doesn't introduce us, neither does the first waitress informs our new waiter. Anyway, he came in sounding like he just wants us to order already so we did. As time went by, we noticed everyone else receiving the complimentary bread that is usually served while we wait for our food but this time around we had to ask one of the waiters/waitresses if we can have some. My brother then receives his brunch combo, I'd give it a 9/10 because the waffles the substituted were spot on. My mother and I split a Kobe Burger, it was cooked the way we wanted it with sweet potato fries so I'd give it 9.5/10. Overall, I gave them a 3/5 mainly due to the service. First of all, we had a waitress at first then a waiter and never got informed their name. Second, neither asked if we needed anything else as for condiments or more water. Lastly, neither one came to our table after we received our food to see how it is. Of course, we always come here for the amazing food and I hope to have a better experience with their customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=80

TC K.,"Glendale, CA",85,5,1,1.0,4/15/2017,"So I order Door Dash delivery from this Cheesecake factory. To start, I'm already mad because the driver calls and says there's no parking, so we have to put on shoes, go down three flights and walk outside to get our food when he has already been tipped ahead of time. Now for Cheesecake. The food is cold. I ordered chicken picatta with extra mushrooms instead of pasta. They give me extra pasta and no chicken. NO CHICKEN! Who orders chicken picatta with no chicken? No one that's who. Jesus.  Now I'm going through it all over again and have to wait an hour to see what I get next.

Marcel G.,"Grandville, MI",14,30,18,2.0,2/16/2017,"This is the 2nd time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory and can't say I was impressed. The Chicago location left a bad taste in my mouth and so I figured I'd given it a second chance, and to my dismay nothing changed.   [Server]: Our server was awesome, super nice and chill. Beard game was strong too, looked like he cut lumber for recreation.  [Food]: So I ordered the Chicken Marsala and I was slightly disappointed with the integrity of the dish. The chicken was vapid in flavor, there was absolutely no real good seasonings or rubs applied. The pasta wasn't cooked all the way so it was more chewy than what it should have been, and the sauce glazed over was bland. There was a better party in my glass of chianti than that whole dish.  [Atmosphere]: So this place throws me off. Because it's located in the Americana, so it comes off upscale but then you step inside and it's total opposite. The Cheesecake Factory needs to figure out how it wants to be perceived. The aesthetic of your restaurant comes off classy but if I step inside and close my eyes it sounds like I'm in Red Robin. Maybe Cheesecake doesn't wanna be considered fine dining? Maybe I'm wrong? Maybe it's Maybelline? Anyway, if you are trying to come across fine dining, you missed your mark. Between the overcrowded seating, loud ambience, and the allowance of baby high chairs in-between tables gives it that glorified Olive Garden feeling.  [Overall]: Sorry, won't be returning. Server was kickass but the food was depressing and the atmosphere was overbearing. No thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=120

The chicken portions were a joke. 3 super thin sliced pieces of chicken breasts .....Really? They were almost paper thin. You know how much a piece of chicken breast costs at a local market?

Vanessa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1210,766,2685,3.0,7/8/2016,"I'm not one to ever come to American chained restaurants, but it was for a gf's late bday dinner and she wanted something very simple and casual so what bday girl wants, bday girl gets haha. Since she lives near the area we chose this location, and it's great since there are many stores, as it's right in Americana mall. You can park in the parking structure, and make sure to validate at the restaurant. The inside is pretty big, a bit dim on the lighting. Very casual and relaxed setting and a small bar area in the entrance. As you are seated they give you complimentary breads. I love the oat bread. It's dark colored, like chocolate, and tasted sweet. Kind of remind me of the sweet oat bread from Subway. It comes out a tad warm and so soft. Along with some sourdough bread that is okay but not close to the oat bread. And lots of individual butter. We got another round of bread as we finished the first round first, and I must add it's dangerous because I already started to get pretty full and it's the perfect combo of carbs and sugar :) The menu is pretty big, they have such a huge selection and it's great for families since they have something that everyone can enjoy, all with different taste. I also like how they have a separate low calorie food menu. My gf's and I ordered a bottle of their pinot noir. It was slightly dry, but a nice aroma and smooth. _Endive Salad. Belgian Endive, Radicchio, Glazed Pecans, Blue Cheese and Vinaigrette. My gf usually gets this when she comes here, and I can see why. It's a perfect small salad to start off with. The salad is refreshing but really carries and overpowering and pungent flavor from the blue cheese so make sure not to grab too much as a little goes a long way. Pairs nicely with the candied pecans, for some sweetness and balances well with the cheese and slight bitterness from the radicchio. All the ingredients go well together and the dressing is nicely sweet and tossed easily, which I appreciate. _Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguini. My 2 gf's split this. I tried a bite and it was pretty good, but way too spicy for my liking. It had a real strong pepper aftertaste. The shrimp was nicely cooked and it seemed they put good amounts of it as well. Nothing amazing but if you like spicy this is a safe pasta dish.  _Skinnylicious Soft Tacos. Three Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken or Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Onions, Cilantro and Crema. Served with Escabeche Vegetables. I ordered this from the skinnylicious menu. I got chicken. It comes with all the toppings on the tacos but I asked for it all on the side. Good amount for 1 person or 2 to share. It was okay, I've had better tacos elsewhere, and was not really expecting much. The chicken was overcooked and dry and very bland in flavor. They barely gave enough toppings for all 3 toppings, especially the avocados, they really skimped on that. The best part of this dish was the escabeche vegetables. It was pickled cucumbers and cauliflower, that was refreshing sweet and acidic.  _Tiramisu. Italian Custard Made with Mascarpone, Whipped Cream, Lady Fingers, Marsala and Coffee Liqueur. Topped with Whipped Cream and Ground Chocolate. Surprsingly, pretty good. I know it's cheesecake factory but none of us were in the mood for cheesecake, but actually all agreed on tiramisu. It was great, but holly jeeeeeezzzz..... can you put any more whipped cream in the plate?! I couldn't tell if the dessert was the whopped cream or tiramisu. One whip would have been enough. Nothing like taking a classic great dessert and smothering and over killing it with cheap american sugar. There was barely any ground chocolate as they mentioned. I would get this, just ask for easy on the whip cream. Nothing to rave about, and I would not come here again, unless someone wanted to go for their birthday haha.

Sue K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,28,48,5.0,11/4/2016,"It's all about their salads! I love getting their entree salads. It's not cheap. However, as an entree, it's well priced. Average is $15 - $15.50. I've tried most of their salads. My favorite 2 are the Luau Salad and the Santa Fe Salad. You get a large/huge portion with meat (usually grilled chicken). They are absolutely delicious.  Their salad dressings are so good! I especially like the spicy peanut-cilantro vinaigrette which comes on the Santa Fe Salad. It has a nice kick to it.  I've had takeout salads from here. Their takeout containers are large sturdy plastic containers. Takeout portions are the same as eating in. Unlike CPK, their takeout salad portions are so much smaller than eating in that it's not worth it.

They were closing, although I was the only person in line, basically the counter informed me until they figured I was not going to go away and finally took my order and waited an additional 5 mins for them to give it to me! The slice was in the box, all it needed was it's signature whipped cream. Although the guy that took my order walked away and when he came back, realized I was still standing there and then gave me my order! When I sat down to enjoy my slice, I had a runny whipped cream that was spattered all over the place and ruined the presentation and quite frankly the slice because it was basically milk pour over it!!!

Love to go here for weekday lunch and Sunday brunch but last Sunday we were the first ones in the door at 10am, so the place was not busy yet at all, we got our breakfast and the eggs were actually cold. Not room temp. But cold. My mom's eggs were too. Pressing for time we didn't send them back. And I got the wrong pancakes. Honest mistake but by the time I got new ones we had to get going. Hosts & servers were nice as usual. Just expected better from TCF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=120

Today everything was crappy steak Diane overcooked... they sent it back brought a new one this one tasted old.... funny thing is my mom's tuna salad also tasted of old overseaoned fish.... so disappointing the only decent thing is the service... wow you guys lost your quality over the years tastes like a truck stop diner food... smells old and you eat it to get by....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=120
Jamie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",707,289,680,5.0,10/9/2015,"I love the location of this place. It's in the Americana so you can either walk around as you're waiting for a table, or you can walk around after you eat because you will be so full. This place is always busy but I know why.  This is a great place to go for a romantic dinner because the ambience is dark and there are candles on the tables and if you sit outside there is a view of the fountain with the water show. You can also come here for group events or birthdays and they will sing happy birthday to you.  I always get some sort of pasta. Of course I love their bread as well not just because it's free, but the Brown bread with oats is my favorite because it is so fluffy and delicious with butter :-) my favorite is the four cheese pasta and the chicken marsala",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=160

We obviously know about the food and many choices, but what some don't know is the unmatched integrity and service of their staff. My girlfriend and I ate here on Saturday night, we had an amazing meal and were talking about our vacation to Costa Rica the upcoming Tuesday. (We have been planning this trip for some time)  The next morning we woke and realized she had forgotten her purse in the booth we were sitting at. She had her ID, cards, $1000 in cash (for trip) and most importantly her passport inside her purse.  The ONE vacation we were able to plan/save for just came to a screeching holt. When we went the next day to ask the manager if the purse was found we weren't sure what to expect.  The cleaning crew had turned-in the purse with everything still intact and every cent there.

Sometimes you get lucky and if you ask for outdoor seating after 7:45pm you're probably going to have a chance at getting a table Their deserts are delicious and their food is amazing, their selection of pastas is impressive and I am never usually dissapointed but I feel the last visit their food quality declined, the pastas were all glued and bundled up from undercooking and their sauce was just way too salty.

Pierre D.,"North Hills, CA",1,7,6,1.0,11/13/2017,"Ok we have been going to Cheesecake Factory in Passadena for a long long time when we didn't have one in Americana. We used to love this place and used to dine there on a regular basis, but I guess this time they lost us as a customer after giving it so many chances. This time took an hour to get us a table which is ok I understand  they're very busy. After that we ordered our appetizer and main meal @  the same time, and we asked the waiter specifically to bring our appetizer first, which didn't happened and he brought everything at the same time, ok no big deal then asked for a ranch ,10 minutes later I had to remind him again, and he sorry I'll bring it right now, that didn't happen ask another waitress and finally she brought it after my daughter Frech frys were cold. Then my wife asked for extra sauce on the side for her Fettuccine pasta ,after another 10 minutes they brought a disgusting bowl of oil which they called sauce. We didn't want the past anymore, and instead my wife asked for a bottle of mineral water and that took another 10 minutes to bring, and when I asked what was going on. Waitress told us he had to pick it up from the bar like any other drinks that's why it took a long time to bring it. Obviously they don't care since they are very busy, and since customer service does not mean anything to them. They will loose a lot of customer slowly but surely unless they do something about it.

My drink was almost lemon-y with no Bacardi in it - just like Coke and lemon~! The bartenders were more interested in talking to each other, rather than socializing somewhat with the guests, - usually that's why people sit at the bar, right?

Paola N.,"Los Angeles, CA",824,351,1645,5.0,7/27/2015,"You can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. THE AMBIANCE: This is my most frequented location. The restaurant is clean, spacious, and has high ceilings. I tend to sit at the bar and there is ample room to enjoy a meal. THE FOOD: The Cheesecake Factory starts you off with a complimentary basket of warm white and wheat bread. The wheat bread (brown) is to die for and I usually request that we get a basket of all wheat bread because I don't like wasting food and the white bread rarely gets eaten. That is how good the brown wheat bread is.  My favorite appetizers are the Ahi Carpaccio (Thin Slices of Raw Ahi Tuna, Wasabi Pesto, Creamy Avocado and Togarashi Aioli), and Crispy Crab Wontons (Crabmeat Blended with Cream Cheese, Green Onion, Water Chestnuts, and Sweet Chili Sauce Fried Crisp in Wonton Wrappers). The Ahi Carpaccio I can eat sometimes as my lunch entree if I am not that hungry because I always eat a lot of bread and butter at the beginning *guilty* It is soooo good. I usually ask for light wasabi pesto. The Togarashi Aoili on the side is beyond delicious. You just want to drink it. The Crispy Crab Wontons are so good and so fattening but I don't care. I would literally eat them all if someone else wasn't picking at the plate.  My favorite entrees are: Chicken Madeira (Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes), Miso Salmon (Fresh Miso Marinated Salmon Served with Snow Peas, White Rice (make it brown rice!!) and Miso Sauce), and the Chicken Di Pana (Lightly Breaded Sauteed Chicken Breast Served over a White Wine Butter Sauce with Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli).  The only plate I tried and didn't like was the Thai Lettuce Wraps (Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three (3) Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew). I am a big fan of P.F. Chang's Lettuce Wraps and these lettuce wraps don't even compare. It is like night and day. I would never order them again. My favorite cheesecake is the Key Lime! Perfection. All of their cheesecakes are on point. THE TIPS: Don't forget to validate your parking ticket!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=160

Upon first glance, the menu seems to have so many options! I had a hard time deciding between the firecracker salmon, Vietnamese shrimp spring rolls, angel hair pasta, and grilled avocado club, but ultimately decided on the veggie burger with a gluten free bun.  I love the company's history, mission statement, and their goal to make each meal custom how you like it. The ambience is nice and I also love the courtesy bread.  The food... Was delicious. My husband ordered a margarita pizza, and the crust was absolutely perfect. My burger was a mouthful filled with all the right fixings. I appreciate the presentation as well - with the little cups of Ketchup and separate container for the fries.  Our server was great. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I was still working on my food when he snatched the plate from beneath me.

We got seated a little after 6:30pm. We put in our order right away because I have my 5yo with us. We ordered the simplest dish for my kid -- spaghetti in pink sauce. To make the long story short, at 8PM, we still didn't have our food. We suspect that our waitress, Erin N., went on a break, completely forgot about us or didn't assign anyone who will check on us. She walked back to our table after 1.5 hours saying, ""where is your food?"". Mind you, the spaghetti came last, several minutes after all 3 dishes and she said, they messed up the sauce! Of course, after we were done, it took another 20 minutes for her to bring back the check and another 10 minutes to run the card.  Let's not talk about not providing us with any water refill, not giving us the butter that we requested that we ended up not eating the bread because it was already hard, that we asked another waiter for extra forks and a different waiter for cheese for the spaghetti and she forgot the box after we handed her the payment :( It was supposed to be a happy occasion but the service just ruined it all.

Angela M.,"Burbank, CA",172,224,143,3.0,4/3/2017,"Sadly disappointed in my service last week. Went here for a late lunch and ordered 2 salads. Took about 50 mins to get our food. I'm pretty sure the server forgot to put them in (which happens) however he was avoiding us and acting really awkward rather than just apologizing and giving us some kind of accommodation. Food was tasty but I was shocked in the lack Of service since Cheesecake Factory workers are usually some of the best waiters...... management needs to be more involved on the floor directly rather let servers ""attempt"" to resolve issues, especially when they don't resolve anything at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=60

Andrea K.,"Auburndale, MA",101,123,30,2.0,9/20/2017,"Every time I come here ( this is the 3rd time), it gets a little worse. Despite what the Cheesecake Factory Guest Relations person wrote after my last review, this is not an isolated experience. It's been 8 months and it's just as 2-star as it was back in January. I sat at the bar, which was completely empty. I ordered a Greek salad and the bartender walked away. I had to flag him down to order the rest of my meal. The salad came promptly but for some reason had kernels of corn at the bottom of it. At first, I didn't know what it was and was almost feeling sick because there were dried yellow particles in it. I realized it was corn and felt slightly better but - gross. I asked the bartender about it, he said, ""wow. That shouldn't be there"" and walked away. I asked to speak to the manager who was apologetic and accommodating. He said, ""it just falls into the salads sometimes"". I asked if he'd take half off of the salad, since I'd eaten half before I saw the corn. He took my check & said he'd be back. 20 mins later I asked the bartender if he knew where my check was. He said he'd ask the manager but eventually just reprinted it, the manager had removed the salad. That was nice, and above what I requested, but to not come back and to keep me waiting so long was a bit.... crappy.  I can see how corn ends up in salads if the GM doesn't have the customer service etiquette to follow-through with the customers; there's a low standard of service set at this location and after reading other reviews I can see it's an ongoing problem here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=60

Chris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,211,1041,1.0,8/24/2017,"Tamara's actions lead me to believe that she's a novice manager. I'm definitely disappointed with my experience here, tonight. I used to frequent this location. However, after tonight's experience, I don't know that I'll be coming back anytime real soon. Unfortunate. The dish that I ordered was supposed to come with both pasta and chicken.  The chicken was to be breaded after it was pounded to death, to make it thin and easy to cook. Anyway, the chicken was presented to me in pieces, looking like someone had taken it possibly to a different table, it being cut into and then taking it back to bring it to my table.  Anyway, it was definitely not what I'd received in previous visits.  I explained to the manager that the plating alone made it very unappetizing.  So, she offered to take it back and to have a new one made.  I said that would be OK.  After a few moments, she brought my dish back to me and showed me that it was OK and that I was basically sending back a dish that was perfectly fine.  Why would you do that? I told you that I was disgusted by the appearance of the dish and yet you bring it back to me. Why? To say that I was wrong and throw it in my face? Not cool!  This was not the best performance from this particular manager.  You don't bring the dish back and try and prove to the customer that the manager or kitchen staff were right, and not you.  It took forever for my replacement to come and just before it did, I told them to forget my order and just remove it from my bill.  By the time that I'd just finished saying that, the dish appeared behind the manager.  I told them I still didn't want it and that my experience there had just been miserable and embarrassing even.  I don't appreciate behavior like that. So, I told them to take the dish off my bill and to forget it. I was no longer in the mood to eat there. The manager refused. I told them that I would NOT be paying for something that had been ill prepared and that I never ate. I NEVER took a bit from the first plate or the 2nd one that FINALLY came along. I eventually was able to speak to their GM.  They had the dish removed immediately without my really having to go through the re-cap of my horrible experience. They even offered me a complimentary dessert for that night or a future night. Whatever. That didn't make it OK. I'm still NOT a happy camper!  I haven't been back since early this year, February 2017.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=60

Geoff Y.,"London, United Kingdom",147,349,86,5.0,2/28/2017,"In the middle of the Americana mall, probably the best place to eat between that and the Glendale Galleria and it's just started to rain. Of course it was going to be busy. But go to the desk, put your name down, get their estimate and mentally at 15 minutes, take the little buzzer and walk away from the immediate area. Find a quiet spot in the waiting area if you can, or break ranks and leave the family behind and do some shopping while they wait. What you don't do is constantly go to the desk asking for an update or make a big deal about how long the queue is. People got there before you, deal with it, the hostesses don't need for you to give them a hard time. As it was for us, I managed to get a little shopping done at the Apple store and Barnes and Noble during the 30-minute wait (on the dot! No extension to their estimate). And we were taken to our booth and a high chair was brought for my niece. Good service from the waitress, not great but she did have a very busy section. Menus were looked at and dishes chosen, a mixture of appetisers and entrees. These were ordered and delivered in good time, and the table quickly got crowded with plates, which were quickly whisked away once emptied. Their spinach and artichoke dip is great, although the nachos were slightly too big for a non double dipper. They were definitely two biters. The egg roll platter didn't do anything for me although lots of tables were ordering it. The mains looked great and were apparently very tasty, I got the bang bang chicken and shrimp, which was great. Thai spices, peanut sauce, good amounts of chicken and quite a few shrimp (although I'd have preferred more shrimp, less chicken) and a nice load of vegetables. It was a bit much though and I was happy sharing it with other members of my family. No cheesecake eaten at the cheesecake factory, but I learned a long time ago that you can either eat a main course or a dessert there, never both if you want to continue functioning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=60

Emmanuel M.,"Hanford, CA",2,23,5,1.0,12/22/2017,"This is a story of the last time I will ever give my business to a Cheesecake Factory. This review isn't about the food, it's about an item that was left at this particular restaurant. 12/17/17, has dinner here with my girlfriend. We leave the restaurant and once we're home we realize we left an item (cologne from Sephora) back at the restaurant. I immediately call once I realized it and luckily, one of the staff members set the item aside with my name and number. A day passes, I call the restaurant and tell them I'll be there in a couple days to pick it up. They assure me it fine, item is still set aside. 12/22/17 I drive to the restaurant for the item, one of the host says he can't find it, but he can take my name and number so he can speak to a manager later to locate the item...I explain to him I'm not from the area and drove an hour and a half to pick up my item and I was told it was set aside for me with my name and number attached. After beating around the bush a little, a manager finally comes and speaks to me and says it's not in the managers office and it's not in the lost and found, there's isn't anything they can do, and it's gone. I ask if he can speak to the waiter from that night and he says it wouldn't be possible to find out who was working that night....he gives a corporate number for loss prevention, which I call and goes to a voicemail. Do not leave anything at Cheesecake Factory, especially if it's a gift for a loved one...unfortunately their loss prevention is negligible and they employ thieves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=60

After going in a few times for a status update, and even requesting to talk to the manager, we were finally called in to be seated at 810pm. Even on a busy night, I think that's pretty unacceptable. Our waiter, Gilbert, introduced himself and said he was going on break. His replacement was so stone-faced that we wondered if he was having a bad day or if he was just like that every day. But when Gilbert returned just when our food was coming out, all was well again. Gilbert is honestly one of the most charismatic and caring waiters I have ever had! He was so on top of it and had the best attitude the whole time! If I could just rate the point of the dinner from when Gilbert returned to our table after his break, I would give the restaurant five stars because his service is amazing, the food tasted great (presentation is nice, and the portions are huge), and we all had a fantastic time (and practically forgot about the beginning of the night).

When it was our turn we found out that they had inputted our information incorrectly (requested a table for 3, they inputted a table for 2). Instead of apologizing, he rudely told us that we'd have the next table and just moved on to seating other tables. I'm assuming he wasn't a host or waiter because he was dressed in more professional attire than the others. What a damn shame it is- you'd think he'd make an effort to be a prime example of customer service.

Jason C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,23,,4.0,2/3/2016,"The pyramid of flavor power.  We all know this place offers, from the top down, everything under the food chain arranged with inspiration from every corner of the globe...on one menu. Then bread and butter and/or oil and balsamic on request, and dammit if that bread isn't addicting. Tall glasses of any beverage that make bringing Europeans here a real treat.  Cheesecake pioneered gluttony in the 1980's (as far as I knew, but '78 upon looking it up) when they began as a sandwich shop in Bev's Hills. Big sandwich's, then big portions became all the rage. And it was good. I'm here to report it still is today.  Speaking of the bread, it was about a year or two ago I noticed they changed the yeast they were using to produce the sourdoughs, which made a HUGE difference in the structure and flavor of the bread. How the hell they implement that across 180 or so locations is probably a news segment worthy of producing, and an surprisingly interesting one to watch.  When we think of chain restaurants, the title is not one of glamour. So how is a chain restaurant defined? 5 restaurants? 10? It's technically 2 or more, with a unified architecture regarding both the type of food, and sometimes the construction of the building. Cheesecake therefor qualifies. But that does not make it bad.  In fact, the chicken parm sandwich was served on this new sourdough, with their perfect tenderized and fried chicken (yet why the fried chicken salad was taken away I'll never know), and very tomato-y marinara, making it a great sandwich. Sitting at the bar allowed for an insight into the bartender's life in a 300+ seat restaurant pouring enormous drinks. Busy. Yet still the service was exemplary. Yes. That stupid word. Mostly because ""great"" sounds like when someone describes someone as ""neat"", but when they mean it in a good way. The guac was solid too. Really. Chicken wings, just right. Not reinvented, but done well. People are surprised when I say this. Why do people have to hate? Because of the butter thing? Sure, they put butter in everything. And when it can't be butter, it is another fat the vegans and vegetarians can all agree on. But so what? Isn't this what those diners that we all love to love because we find something charming in their dinginess offer the world? Okay, I lost some of you there, but that is fine. Those left standing probably agree: It's a Jersey diner on a national level. And it's good. Just bring back the fried chicken salad. I realize it's not a healthy salad. That's not why I go to a place named after the most fattening form of dessert ever invented - sugary cream with a buttered graham cracker crust. Or keep coming up with new dishes.  I'm a fan. I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=340

Zachary K.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",6,4,1,1.0,7/20/2016,"Normally I would be giving this place a 5 Star rating but just got some of the worst customer service from a worker who claims to be the manager named Kevin. Though I believe that one worker should not determine the rating of an entire restaurant, let this be a wake up call to whoever decides to read my experience. So to give a little detail on the situation: I call in to place a take-out order for my little sister who works inside of the Americana, who at the time happened to be getting off from her night shift at 10:30. She was extremely hungry so I wanted to set up an order for when she got out to walk over and pick up. When calling in I spoke with a guy named Andre who kindly transferred me to the Bakery so I can place my take out order.  After waiting almost 5 minutes on hold, this guy Kevin picks up and right off the bat is rushing me to place my order. I tell him what I want and without giving me a chance to speak another word he goes ahead and puts my order into the kitchen. And this is before I could mention that I wanted it set for 10:30 pick-up. Following this just before he is about to hang up the phone I barely slip in my directions for the order , only then he claims that its late and that it will be ready in 10-15 minutes. Long story short, after an argument over the simple fact that I want the food to be prepared at 10:30 so it is not cold he rudely argues back saying it was my fault that I did not mention it before, and that he was going to see what he could do. I told him go ahead do what u can and hung up feeling disgusted with the service I just received. So I had to call back in and get a manager on the phone and sure enough he is the one to answer. When I realize this , I ask to be transferred to a manager, and he claims to be it. So I straight up let him know that is no way to treat a customer before I cut the conversation short and got off the phone. To wrap things up without going in more detail, I am writing this review in disgust of the fact that someone like that answers the phone for take out orders. I feel sorry for the company if more situations like this happen to others when calling in to place an order. Anyhow I will leave it at that .

I've tried almost everything on the menu and yesterday after going again I realized that a lot of the menu items contain CHIcKeN! What about the folks who are vegan or vegetarian????

Oh yeah, the place was packed so and we still got excellent service. ***** for the service. The food on the other hand was just OK.   Pasta with Chicken and Scampi sauce-The pasta was cooked perfect and the sauce was creamy delicious. My problem was with the chicken pieces. Cut too big and they were not soft and tender. They were rather chewy. I did not finish them all, just ate few pieces. *** for this. Vegan Jambalaya- My daughter's favorite dish. Made out of Pasta instead or rice. Did not have enough sauce she had to order extra. **** for this. Bread was fresh. Asked for ranch dressing for dipping instead of butter.  They give you validation. I am not sure if it was 2 or 3 hours.  Parking at this Mall is very expensive if you are spending the whole day. We arrived at 12 until 7, with the validation still ended up paying $18.00.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=360
Elvira D.,"Los Angeles, CA",308,172,742,4.0,7/16/2017,"I appreciate the convenience of the Cheesecake Factory at a beautiful location like the Americana for a late dinner. Although the wait can be long at times, it's nice to know that it's open until late and you can peruse the stores nearby while you wait. The food isn't the absolute Michelin-rated best, which is expected at chain restaurants, but it's good enough to go back.  Some favorites: *Tex mex egg rolls *Barbecue ranch chicken salad (which will be drenched in dressing if you don't specify otherwise) *Nachos *Of course, their cheesecakes (big enough to share with 2 people) And in all honesty, you're safe getting any of the menu items and being happy with the food.

Rebecca W.,"Los Angeles, CA",740,320,746,3.0,5/17/2017,"Your standard beloved Cheesecake Factory. I love this one because it is located in the Americana in Glendale. My friend and I came here for a quick lunch before we went to catch a movie. We ordered the Mexican Tortilla Salad, the Chicken Parmesan Pizza, and the Bacon and Cheese Appetizer. The appetizer was good - very, VERY heavy. I could only eat one. I enjoyed the Mexican Tortilla salad a lot - there's two tortillas at the bottom with black beans woooo what a cool surprise. The Chicken Parmesan Pizza was literally a glop of pasta on top of a pizza LOL - so basically exactly what it sounds like. Cheesecake Factory always gives the biggest whoppingest portions, so each dish you order can be eaten over 2+ meals.

I could probably say that I've almost tried all of the different flavors. My favorite dish is the pasta da vinci, can't really describe what's in it except that it was chicken and mushrooms and the sauce is amazing! Service is always amazing, the waiters I always get are attentive and make sure we're doing okay.  I decided to try something new and got the chicken riesling and it was delicious - it was a butter pasta with this wine sauce around it with chicken and bacon and some other stuff. I mixed the sauce into my pasta and it made it even better. If you're looking for something to drink, I would either get strawberry lemonade as a non-alcoholic drink, or if you're looking for something with alc, then the Long Island ice tea is the way to go. I came on a good night (Thursday around 9) and was seated within 10 minutes. Glendale has been so busy that sometimes the wait times are almost 2 hours, which is ridiculous!!!

We shared the soup salad special (clam chowder & mixed green) and the Sheila's Chicken avocado salad.  The Sheila's was excellent and of course the portions are huge as always.  So, I know that TCF is a chain that normally doesn't get much respect.  However, I've always had pretty good experiences with TCF.  So whenever I go to the malls, I will keep on trying different locations as I run into them!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=20

Amy G.,"Glendale, CA",0,4,5,1.0,10/4/2017,"I live at the Americana so I speak as an expert here.  Do not EVER order takeout from this location. Honestly I'd be hesitant to go at all.  My neighbor and I both got severe food poisoning from chicken here. Mine was from takeout that had chicken - they didn't bring it out until over 15 minutes after the time quoted. It was cold. I warmed it up at home, and 12 hours later I was sleeping on the floor of my bathroom with a severe fever and not even able to keep water down. My neighbor was also sick, and it lingered enough that she was tested by her doctor two weeks later and tested positive for salmonella.  Cheesecake Factory of course denied any wrong doing, but sent us each a $20 gift card for our troubles.  Tonight I was really hungry and decided to finally give them another chance so I didn't keep carrying this gift card around. I ordered the Factory Nachos - no meat, so I was hoping it was safe.  After again making me wait an extra 15 minutes after my quoted time, my Nachos came out cold. Not even lukewarm, cold. I didn't want to take the chance again so I had them give me a refund. I went there hungry and left over half an hour later with no food and a conviction that this is the level of quality anyone can expect here.  I have been going to Cheesecake Factorys since I was a child. I always thought of them as a reliable and nice place to eat. I will never eat here again, and since I live upstairs and like the sort of food they make, that's saying a lot. Edited to add: Instead of refunding me to a new gift card, they literally fished the used gift card out of the trash and gave it back to me.

Jonathan was no better, he never came back.  We were forced to flag down another waiter to get the check. My wife and I have been here before and received good service.  This is the first time the service was this bad.

I really like the bread they always give in the beginning, but it's not great when it's not warm.  I really like the Davinci pasta and the Louisiana chicken pasta there. I think these two dishes really have a good medley of flavors.  I'm usually not a big fan of desserts, but the red velvet cheesecake was good. It wasn't overbearingly sweet as I thought it would be.  I've also been here during happy hour. Appetizers and drinks are great during this time at an even better price.  Service is great and friendly. An enthusiastic waiter/waitress makes a real big difference.  Overall, besides the children that scream and cry out every once in awhile, and having to talk over voices since it's kinda loud in there, it has a good ambience.  People really like celebrating their birthdays here (I think it's kinda exciting).

No one really cares about relationships and service. It's really systematic, in and out. In addition DO NOT, DO NOT order to go especially via DoorDash. Horrendous experience.

Katie L.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,1,1,1.0,5/30/2017,"I've never left a review at yelp before, but I think have to leave one now. I have to say that I really like the cheesecake factory restaurants however I think this is the worst location. This is my second time dining in here at the Americana and I had the worst experiences for both. First time here, there was a roach on our table. We were so disgusted and lost appetite and so we decided to leave without finishing 1/4 of our dishes. We called the manager, but as he tried to catch it it disappeared behind the seat we were seating. He couldn't catch it and it made us to feel more disgusted. I didn't leave a review at that time because the manager told us that we didn't have to pay for our bill. That was about 6 months ago.  I thought I'd never coming back to this store, but we came shopping yesterday to Americana and my friends wanted to dine here. So we dined here for the second time yesterday. This time, it was the quality of food and service we received that disappointed us. Our server seemed like he's been working for only few months and seemed very unprofessional. It took him forever to get what we asked for. We didn't even get the utensils until we received our first dish. We asked for new side plates since some of the plates given were dirty. He came back with wet dishes which seemed like he tried poured some water on them. We were really hungry and stressed by long waiting. We didn't want to get stressed by complaining and the attitude of our server made us speechless. So we decided to just wipe the dishes and eat. We ordered a pasta davinci and a hibachi steak. Pasta da vinci was very dry and tasted like nothing and very oily on the bottom. Hibachi steak was all burnt. We were so disappointed because these two are our favorites from the restaurant and we know how it's supposed to taste like. I really wanted to like this place because we come here often to shop and we really like the restaurant, but these two experiences, I think I'll never come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=220
Tee L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,32,58,1.0,2/4/2017,"Dear Glendale Cheesecake Factory management, This review is written in regards to the table wait time. Let it be noted that our party of three entered your location during an off hour time today while your waiting area was practically empty (so empty that I was not given a pager and was only asked for my name). Customers who we knew were before us were being called by name and were taken to tables. As new customers entered the restaurant requesting for tables your hosts began handing out pagers. Still waiting for our table, noticing that now only customers who have pagers were being called to be seated, I approached a male host and explained that I was there earlier and not given a pager but only my name. He checked the computer, looked and me, then handed me a pager and told me it would be a 15 minute wait. I returned to my party and informed them of our status and we were in disbelief. Our party had already waited 30 minutes before the rush of new customers came in. Then to have the new customers seated before us, the apathetic attitude of the male host, and being told we had additional wait time for a table, our party chose to leave.

First of all, we were seated at a booth where no server made contact for drinks or bread or anything for 15 minutes. Eventually, I had to get up and go to the hostess stand to inquire about our server. A manager (I'm guessing) walked me back to my booth where she promptly apologized and served us up our drinks. Okay, cool. No big deal. Then we waited again... for 10 minutes... until a server finally came over and apologized and brought us some bread. We gave her our food order (a sandwich and an appetizer) and then waited another 15-20 minutes for our food.  While we waited, no check up on our table.  We get our food and are finally finishing up when A GODDAMN ROACH crawls out from the crack between the table and the wall. A fucking german roach... so I am very sure there are more roach buddies hanging out nearby. I searched reviews and because I love cheesecake factory, was going to suggest avoiding any and all booths and opt to eat outside, but apparently roaches are also a problem out there... so sorry guys, I'm out of ideas.

If you call them they either don't answer or when they do they put you on a hold for minimum 10-15 min. I have been here multiple times and I have ordered from them personally for pick up and also from multiple 3rd party companies like ""postmates"" and I have been fed up with them the last 2 times I ordered. I ordered a chicken Depana a while back when they were still serving this dish (very upset about that,) and when the item arrived it was missing the mashed potatoes. When I called to tell them that, they told me it was impossible and that the dish came with it. I explained I knew it came with it because that was the only dish I ever ordered but it was missing. They basically told me I'm lying and hung up on me. The second time I tried to order through postmates. I ordered everything and got a confirmation and then 20 mins later my order has been cancelled due to ""merchant  being too busy to take orders"" what does that even mean? You open your doors at 11am how are you too busy at 11:30am to take orders?

Take any average place with average food coupled with great service and you have a great restaurant. Food done well.  If there was any negative I would say the automatic dimming of lights at 5:15 pm. The night manager referred to it as ambiance lighting but we all agreed it was dark. I asked if we could pay for extra electricity. Maybe a hand generator at each table where guests could crank their own power would be an option. Couldn't read the dessert menu or see the faces of the others, good thing I know who was there. As luck would have it I had my trusty light meter and although I had a ceiling light directly over me showing about 10 lumens the rest of the table was less than 1 and it was a big table (in comparison a candle in front of you is about 12, the same candle 1 meter away is 1),.

Cindy Z.,"San Francisco, CA",867,705,1110,5.0,1/18/2016,"I'm a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory, especially when it's located in a such a prominent location at The Americana --that definitely adds to the eating experience here. The boyfriend and I decided to come here for a late lunch after shopping at 3pm. It was very crowded and there was half an hour wait. We decided to seat outside because it was such a beautiful day and we had a great view of the fountain. Our server, Simon was wonderful and quick to refill our drinks and meet our requests. We decided to share the Louisiana Chicken Pasta ($13.50) for the lunch special. Despite the dish being a smaller lunch portion, it was still plentiful. This is my absolute favorite pasta ever. The creamy sauce covering the bowtie pastas is delicious. Also, it's topped with sauteed mushrooms and chopped bell peppers. The best part is their crunchy, fried chicken on top of the pasta that's just splendid. I'm also a huge lover of cheese if you haven't noticed yet, so I definitely had the waiter spend a couple of minutes covering my pasta with parmesan cheese. My pasta was basically covered with snow! To pair with the pasta, the complimentary bread is great with anything with a sauce-base. I especially enjoy their honey oat bread, which is what I crave most from The Cheesecake Factory. To end our meal, we shared the White Chocolate Macadamia Caramel Cheesecake ($7.95). I was a little disappointed with the cheesecake as the nuts were too much for me and lacked a true cheesecake texture. I'd be surprise if you didn't go home with leftovers from here as to why we shared our meals. It was more than enough for the two of us, which left us in a food coma right after.

The service has always been good- so they never lack there. It was extremely hard for me to find a dish that I'd actually be excited to get each time I go, versus just being excited for the view/ambiance. This past time we went (last week) I have finally found a dish that I'd order again and again. The Seared Ahi Tuna. Being a big fish eater, I was always concerned getting a fish dish from a place that serves so many different types of food and doesn't really specialize in any particular entree, but I am so glad I gave it a shot.

The service is fine, attentiveness is average.  We ordered the classic burger and the lunch salad/pizza. I didn't eat the burger but it looked fine - bacon was added to the burger, and as a note it's on the less cooked side.  The Caesar salad is fine - the Caesar dressing seems to be more of an oily dressing than usual.  The Lunch pizza is where I bring attention. I ordered the pepperoni and it looked fine when it came out. I started to eat it and then I noticed that it had some sort of strange smell, so I smelled it and I thought it maybe was just a different pepperoni. I started to smell the rest of the pizza, such as the cheese and crust. I couldn't put my finger on it because the entire pizza smelled like this item. After eating half of the pizza, we realized that it probably smelled like bleach. I was worried I was going to get sick, so I kind of stopped eating it but then I thought well it means they clean but maybe they spilled bleach into the crust or something.

Rome D.,"North Hollywood, CA",4,20,14,1.0,9/5/2017,"Worse place to dine at the Americana. My wife and I stopped in last night after shopping and let me tell you, the management team is weak therefore the service is weak.  1. After waiting about 45mins for a table for 2, the host walks us over to our table. Well the busier was still clearing it off, so the host says as soon as he's done you can sit then walks away. So my wife and I are standing around between other families and their tables looking foolish.  2. We were seated for about 4 to 5 minutes before our server stopped by. When he did stop by he simply slid a basket of bread onto the table and walked away. Then the host returned with menus.  3. After another 5 minutes after that the server comes back by drops off water and says I'll be back.  4. Another 3 minutes the server returned and says ""do y'all want drinks?"" (Clearly this behavior is signed off on by his management team, since he believes when dealing in customer service/ hospitality you should probably introduce yourself) So my wife orders a drink then he looks at me and says nothing but just gives a blank look. So I said ""water is fine, I'm ready to order"".  We place our order and almost 15 minutes later (I had my phone out and was timing him at this point) my wife's drink comes. He drops the drink off and never returned.  I see him taking with some girls in the bar so I flag him down like I'm directing traffic. He comes over and says ""what's up"" (I guess we're homies now). So I asked for the check, at this point we've been setting for about 40 minutes. He give my check to the manager (again didn't introduce herself).  So give a quick summary to the manager. She quickly offers free cheesecake. I declined and told her, I simply want to pay my check and leave.  As I'm waiting for my card, the server shows up with the food and looking confused. So I had to tell him ""no thank you, we're done here"".  Walked across the courtyard over to Katsuya and had a much better experience and time with my wife. I went from BBQ Pizza to Sushi. Not what I was craving but when I'm paying for a service that what I expect simple, polite service. I understand we all have to wait, that's not the issue. The issue here was Service, Etiquette, Hospitality, and Professionalism! My wife and I got none of that.  We won't be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=40
Sami S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,111,302,1.0,8/14/2017,"Seriously folks, this was the very first time that I have ever stepped foot in a Cheesecake Factory, and probably will be the last time. I always thought of the Cheesecake Factory much like the Spaghetti Factory but just one step higher, but now I think of it as just a 1/2 step higher. The reason for our big discount on my receipt was that my guest had to complain about the broken glass under our table near his feet (someone before us broke a glass salt shaker).  When my guest mentioned the glass under our table to the waiter at the time we placed our dinner order, the waiter looked under our table saying ""OMG!"" but he never brought anyone over to clean up the broken glass.  When our dinner plates finally arrived they gave my guest only 2 small shrimps with the rest chicken chunks and pasta. My guest complained to the waiter and the dinner server about not having enough shrimp, so the waiter requested some more shrimp. When the shrimp (just 4 more pieces) finally came 15 minutes later my guest food had gotten cold. When he asked if they have a microwave to re-heat his plate the waiter said, ""Sorry, we do not have a microwave."" I then offered to the waiter buy this place a $13 microwave at Big Lots. The waiter thought that was funny. When I told to waiter to ""Just blow on his dinner to make it hot again"" he just laughed again and thought that was funny too.   My guest left a bit upset about his dinner and having to take his dinner home in a doggie bag, but I have to say that I did warn him ahead of time about choosing to go to this place for dinner since I saw the low rating of this location.    On the other hand, my dinner was just ""okay"" but bland tasting and a bit luke-warm. I did not complain about anything during our time at this place because my friend was doing all the complaining about this place himself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=40

When we requested a booth since we saw a couple available, our waiter tells us that they're about to be taken, which wasn't true, they got filled in til about 15 minutes later. I was bothered that they cramped 4 of us into those small tables where you're forced to sit next to complete strangers yet were seating 2 people at various booths. Our waiter was honestly quite terrible, I'm pretty sure he must've been new or training. He spills my friend's drink all over the table and on his food and while he did apologize he never offered to bring a replacement for the food he completely ruined.

One of our waters had something floating in it, and after that the service went further downhill. She stopped coming around, and we had to ask someone to track her down so that we could put our order in. She brought us full portions of all the lunch items that we ordered. And she asked us if we really wanted to change to lunch portions because the kitchen would have to throw the food away. I really wanted to pipe back at her that she could just readjust the order and let us keep the food instead. I felt like she was staring us down to try to change our minds.

To begin with - my family & I come to CF a lot. Though I've had more good experiences than bad ones at this location, I decided to never come back. Anyways, the service sucked. At the moment I just thought whatever, it happens, I get it, they're probably just understaffed & hey- it's Sunday brunch. Being a server myself, I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt & insisted on tipping well (again- I live off of my tips as well & HATE when I get stiffed.) However, after receiving the check, I noticed the server thought it would a great idea to PERSONALLY  UNDERLINE the highest ALREADY SUGGESTED TIP & WROTE ""thanks."" I immediately get upset & tell my mother to pay at the front desk to avoid seeing the servers faces again. While I'm the last one to leave the booth, one of the servers points to my mother & sister & tells the other to run after them. HE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DITCH.  I yelled at him & told him we were paying upfront.  HOW DARE THEY?! Not only did they assume that 1) we weren't capable of reading the SUGGESTED gratuity, 2) assume we weren't even going to tip AND 3) to also humiliate my sister ON HER BIRTHDAY by dramatically stopping her because they thought we were stealing.  I spoke with the manager (or supervisor) Mathew & he was pretty accommodating. He asked me to email picture of the receipt to management & I did it right there on the spot.  After I did so, the server came up to me & apologized for not providing the service that we expected.

Once, we arrived late at night, around 10:45 on a Saturday, and there was about a 15 minute wait for a party of 4. The hostess, when getting my name, wasn't particularly warm in her greeting. The hostess the second time I was there (this time in the afternoon on a weekday) was also simply there. The woman who showed us to our table was also cold and merely pointed to our booth and said, ""It's this one here,"" and then continued on her way. Basically, this place feels like a factory indeed - its employees going through the motions, distant and inaccessible.  Our waitress on this second trip was warm and interacted with the kids; unfortunately, she got my mom's order wrong. We asked for then salmon from the Skinny menu, and it arrived with the mash potatoes (the regular menu entre). She also got one of the steaks wrong: we asked for medium rare, and we received a medium well. She made other mistakes, but ultimately, she was pleasant and smiled every time she came by.  The pesto is good and so is the rib-eye steak.

I called two days in advance to make reservation and been told they don't take reservations.. This is the policy ok understood.. They asked me to be there on the day of the party at 5:30pm to make reservation for 7:30( this was told by one of the managers): so i showed up at 5:30 and all I was told was oh we can't make any reservations now, and I mentioned that I've been told to be here by manager and guess what no f** was given. Manager asked me to check back at 6:30 again..So since already the plan was set for this location and didn't want to change it last min had to work around it and stayed till 6:30.

This tables wouldn't be set if I hadn't set the tables myself!! They made my guests wait and because of their lack of understanding the surprise birthday party for my sister in law was about to be ruined if I had not took an action and start setting the tables!!

The real review here goes to their star server Josh, who served us yesterday on a busy night, between the premiere of Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, and the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight.  The place was slammed as usual, but Josh not only provided the best, most attentive service ever, but his personality and sense-of-humor was amazing.  One of the members of our group was on a VERY strict diet, and when he had made mention of wanting an impossibly zero-carb/fat/gluten/calorie/taste carrot cake, Josh brought out a little ramekin of shredded carrots with a cherry on top!  It was the most hilarious (and charming) thing ever.

Let me start off by saying the bread they bring out in the beginning is super tasty. Especially the brown one! All their food is good. From pizzas, pastas, to salads. I love the four cheese pasta. Super delicious and flavorful. The chicken tequila pasta is also extremely creamy and delicious. The Luau (I believe is how you spell it) salad is incredible!!!! You MUST try that when you go there. It's an amazing sweet Chinese dressing with chips and all these good vegetables in there. Also, the fish tacos! They have a huge menu with pages and pages of food, you'll find something! This particular one is a beautiful location in the middle of the mall so you have a lot to do before and after you eat. The only problem I have with this branch specifically is the wait. It really is just too long. The problem is not even necessarily the level of busyness, it's the way they handle it. I would see 6-7 tables empty at a time waiting to seat people for 10-20 minutes. Tables should not be left empty when there is a line out the door. Service isn't that great when they get too busy, but it's still decent.

Richard K.,"East Bay, CA",465,404,3716,1.0,10/18/2014,"God I hate this place. The only reason I go to this ridiculously unhealthy corporate restaurant that is worse than McDonald's in terms of being bad for you is because my silly parents like this place. Then again, they used to think Sizzler was the bomb and they still eat steak well done... SMH.... Look, I just don't get why this place is so popular. Service is always shitty and wait times are almost always an hour or more for food that tastes no better than Stouffer's frozen food. And honestly, I have no idea why they bother with Asian food that tastes worse than Panda Express. Trust me when I say the Teriyaki Chicken with Rice is just deplorable - I mean, it makes Mr. Yoshida's sauce seem heavenly. My silly parents ordered this... uggh... And their shitty pizzas taste pre-packaged since they probably are shipped to the Cheesecake Factory from a Sysco-owned distribution warehouse. And speaking of pre-packaged, you should know that despite its name, none of the Cheesecake Factory restaurants actually make any cheesecakes in-house. All that is done in a ""cheesecake factory"" over in Calabasas. So if you really go to this restaurant for the cheesecake, just stop by the frozen section at your local Ralph's because it's the same shit albeit a whole lot cheaper.  And, as if to make your experience even more ""cheesy"" (pun intended), their menus are as thick as college readers. That is because not only does the Cheesecake Factory have over 200 items to choose from, their menus are filled with more freaking advertisements than the ""free version"" of Angry Birds, YouTube, and the Sunday newspaper combined. I mean, sorry Artin, I really am not  ""thinking of buying or selling"" a home when I look at a menu. Go spend your advertisement money on a bus bench ""bro"".  But the main reason I hate this place is because eating here is unhealthy and will take you one step closer to a heart attack since nearly every entrée here is served with exorbitant amounts of sodium and fat. Take for instance the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta dish consisting of bow-tie pasta, chicken, mushrooms, tomato, pancetta, peas and caramelized onions in a roasted garlic-parmesan cream sauce. This deceptively healthy sounding dish comes out to 2,190 calories, 58 grams of saturated fat (three day's worth) and 1,830 milligrams (mg) of sodium.  That is more than a Big Mac combo with a large Coke (1,580 calories) and two extra cheeseburgers (300 calories each). Moreover, the current dietary guidelines for Americans recommends that adults in general should consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day. And you know those ""famous"" Avocado Eggroll appetizers? One serving is 960 calories and contains 1,130 mg of sodium. And their ""healthy"" salads are filled with exorbitant amounts of sodium that make Maruchan Instant Ramen Noodles seem healthy. Take a look at the Asian Chicken Salad, which the Cheesecake Factory lists under their ""weight management"" section of their menu. While the salad has only 570 calories, it has 2,600 mg of sodium... sneaky, deceptive, shameless. While I apologize for going off-tangent and turning into a health nut there (I just got a blood test and my LDL cholesterol came out high), unless you want the Fattycake Fattery to kill you, you really shouldn't eat here. But don't take my word for it.  * It's funny how they have a ""Skinnylicious"" section of the menu.

The sauce on the cauliflower was choking. Granted, we didn't pick a grant dish. The asparagus in our salmon dish was cold and the shrimp was fried, but it had been soaked in the dish for too long because we had to wait so long so it had become soggy. The salmon was okay.

But I suppose it is in Americana at Brand so it's usually pretty busy, regardless of the day. The food was good, surprisingly good, and the service was good too. Plus they validate parking. I was happy with all of that. But I do have a somewhat minor, and somewhat major gripe. Firstly, am I the only one who is irritated by the superfluous advertisements on the damn menu? What is that? Is Cheesecake Factory going out of business? Do they need to have all those advertisements for the income? It was sad. I haven't seen so many advertisements since the last time I clicked on an inappropriate website and was bombarded with pop ups. Not cool. My major gripe is that their suggested tips on the receipts are based off the total bill, not the subtotal like it's supposed to be. To me, that's a sneaky, dishonest, devious way of doing business and I don't like it. Makes me wonder what else they are doing. Although I was happy about most of my experience, I  won't be rushing back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=260

Today I had to report this to the three hostesses on duty and they all seemed to be also irritated by the news. Or by me. I don't know. I got a snotty reply that was unfriendly. I followed up my news with 2 of the stalls don't have toilet tissue to encourage their sense of urgency.  I find it difficult to enjoy my food when I've ""visited"" a restroom that appears highly neglected. I'm under the assumption that all of the staff are using the same restroom that I just endured. So if they haven't felt the need to have housekeeping take care of it, they must think it's clean or acceptable for customers. Thus, I get concerned with cleanliness everywhere else.

Jam Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",408,161,1876,4.0,9/12/2014,"WHY the low rating?! How can anybody NOT like dining at THEEE Cheesecake Factory. Please solidify my thoughts, what is there not to love? First of all, their menu is just about enormous as their restaurant. The list of dishes is RIDICULOUS. Although, too many options can lead to indecisiveness and maybe even frustration.. But whatever, they all end up tasting great anyway. ONE DOWNFALL: They don't take reservations via phone. Walk-up only. This goes for The Grove location too. And the longest I ever had to wait was 45 minutes and the only reason I agreed to the wait was because there was a Sugarfina location at the corner I wanted to check out (which, by the way was no good) What I got/tried in the past: Da Vinci pasta. Tasted great. The sauce was reminiscent to stroganoff, except slighty sweeter. It's good! The noodles were of penne. Portion is huge, ofcourse. Club Sandwich with fries & ranch dressing. The best part of this meal? THEIR RANCH DRESSING. It's thick and the flavor just explodes in your mouth. The sandwich was good. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. Fries were amazing :) They have one of the best restaurant style fries~!! The Firecracker Salmon appetizer. It tasted great. They're like egg rolls stuffed with salmon. Comes with shredded red cabbage and asian dressing that was yum! It was sweet, garlicy, gingery and sesame-y lol. And I honestly don't remember what else I've tried in the past, but I know I enjoyed my meals every time. So.. unless their lacking in the sanitary department, there really isn't much to complain about.  OH ALSO HOW COULD I FORGET. Their cheesecakes! Vanilla bean was good, tiramisu cheesecake was good, but their KAHLUA COFFEE cheesecake was magnificent. Mm..Mm.. MM! (FYI, cheesecake/other desserts menu is also ridiculous.

I call it, ""OMG YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND BECAUSE OF HOW NICE YOU ARE."" Water cups were filled and refilled again. I ordered a Midori Sour, which was made very alcoholicky (as alcoholic as Midori Sours come, anyway...) They took really good care of my seafood allergy and made sure not to cross-contaminate anything. Fried macaroni cheese balls are a MUST at this Cheesecake Factory--they really, really know how to do them (better than the other Cheesecake Factories, except for maybe The Grove.) I got the Chicken Fettucini with the sun dried tomatoes and pink sauce--pink sauce was perfect, Fettucini was perfect and piping hot, and there was a generous amount of chicken. My friend (who insisted on taking me here for my birthday because she had never had Cheesecake Factory--it's okay, I gasped too--) had a roasted chicken thingy with mashed potatoes and carrots (which she bit into, and proceeded to sigh in contentment.) We had to order the Original Cheesecake (since it was my birthday.) I got a very out-of-tune chorus from the staff and the nice table sitting next to us. Basically, I felt super uber happy.

My wife and I have been here dozens of times. The lunch menu on page 8 of the menu is perfect for those of us who don't wanna carry 10 extra pounds of stomach out of there after we eat. Overall, the chicken madeira dinner is my hand down favorite. Have had repeat orders of Shepard's Pie (it's heavy on the meat) and most of their chicken/pasta dishes. Wife is vegetarian and likes the menu, there's plenty of choices and if they aren't slammed, they will make her order however she wants to adjust it, except for the one time mentioned in the last paragraph of this review. Only had one bad experience here. We were seated on a really slow early lunchtime and the server seemed like she may have had a bad audition that day or something. We weren't thrilled with the extra late greeting, we're easy going people, but the aloof attitude followed by no effort to get wifey a slightly altered sandwich to fit her needs, caused us to get up and walk out after taking a few sips of water. That dropped this rating one star. I still say check out the patio and try to save enough room for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=480

The waiter even tried to squish one of the roaches, like that's going to make the meal any more appetizing. Not to mention the 40 min wait. Manager shrugged it off and acknowledged he knew of infestation. As another waiter tried to squish the many roaches practically flowing out of a bush. Never going to come here again.

We waited at least ten minutes before checking again and they said we didn't make it in time when we were paged so they gave our table away to the next group. Not true. When we were finally seated the service was really really slow. No bread came out no drinks came out.

Came here about 3 weeks ago with my sister, we live in the area and I was craving pasta so we said why not. After coming here I was reminded why I NEVER come here..... It was a Thursday night, we went in and there were about 3 or 4 parties ahead of us waiting to be seated but they were big parties. We walked up to the host at the counter. He completely IGNORED us. It was an African tall guy, not sure what his name was. We were literally right in his face and he was ignoring us, no hi, no how can I help you. Hell, even just saying ""I'll be with you in a moment"" would suffice. NOPE. Ignored us for about 2 minutes until my sister got upset and said ""Hello? Can you help us????"" and he was like ""What do you need?"" WTF? You saw us walk in, what do you possibly think we need? We want to be seated! My sister asked how long the wait was and he asked us how many, she said two. He said ""No wait, I'll seat you guys in a minute"". 5 minutes had gone by and my sister was raging pissed and she walked over and said ""Are you going to seat us now?"" and he was like ""There's 2 parties ahead of you it's going to be about 20 minutes"". Why did you lie and say it would be a minute when you just came back with saying a 20 minute wait. What an idiot. We walked out pissed off and ate somewhere else. Worst service ever. OK, there was no one at the counter when we approached him, he couldn't acknowledge our existence? Worst attitude ever too ""What do you need"". Whatever. If you hate your job no one is forcing you to work there - just quit. A week ago I ordered through Uber Eats because I was craving pasta and my sister wanted a burger. Order came in an hour. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta because supposedly it's like the ""Best thing on the menu"" NOPE. Disgusting. Probably the worst pasta I have ever tasted in my entire life. Bland, and something I could have made for $5 bucks getting all the ingredients at a store. The noodles were nasty and the chicken had so much cartilage I wasted every piece of chicken. It's still lingering on my palette honestly. $18.50 for this pasta has got to be the most insulting joke ever. $18.50 for something that tastes like a wet diaper. No thanks. NEVER AGAIN. I will not support or give my money to any Cheesecake Factory establishment moving forward. Worst experience twice, and disgusting food.  Wish I could give zero stars.

Came here for a Monday lunch birthday celebration and we were immediately seated. The venue is spacious and beautiful. Our server Natalie was very busy (we had to hunt her down a few times) but totally amazing. Excellent Service. We tried her recommendations which included:  1. Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken with extra sauce on the side $17.95 during lunch 2. Steak Diane  $19.95 during lunch Both dishes came with mashed potatoes and were absolutely ON POINT. DELICIOUS.  The dessert (Kahula Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake) on the other hand tasted like diabetes. I was so excited to try it but after the first bite, I couldn't bring myself to eat another bite. Even for my friend who is a sweet tooth still thought it was way too sweet. I'd skip this and try another in the future. I'll be back! 3 small cons:  1. The birthday freebie is a joke. It's a tiny cup of ice cream. Cute but TINY.  2. The regular (not wheat) bread was hard like a brick. We could not even bite into it, let alone break it into pieces. The wheat bread on the other hand was DIVINE. I'd come here just for that wheat bread! 3.

Later on during the meal he introduced to us a different waiter and omg we was mad hot xD he had blonde hair and blue eyes. not to sound creepy but he was real cute.

Ebony G.,"Brooklyn, NY",152,30,11,3.0,2/17/2016,"The last time I went to The Cheesecake Factory was a few years ago and ppl absolutely love this place Mugabe it's because I didn't get the dessert (cheesecake). Well for my entree I had the Chicken Madeira which the waiter raved about and it was actually good except my mashed potatoes were drier and the Madeira sauce should of been poured over it to give it more flavor. As for my BF he has the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp with chicken. He was very disappointed because his nationality is Jamaican and, it was nothing like a Jamaican dish because it was missing the flavor and spices. Instead it said it was on the sweeter side I guess with the mango salsa. He said the rice was hard and the actual best thing on the plate was the Plantains. For drinks we had a Caribbean cooler which was pretty good I just wish it was served in a bigger glass because by time my food came I was done. Overall nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and prices were reasonable in addition to portion sizes.

J.P. B.,"Torrance, CA",276,225,568,4.0,10/6/2013,"I've been to this place plenty of times and most of the time, it is really busy.  They don't take reservations, so if you are planning on dining here on a Friday or Saturday, definitely come early.  With recent additions of new business in the Americana or across the street from the newly remodeled Glendale Galleria, the Americana at Brand is sure to see a lot of people.  They seem to have done away with the paging system, and are now using your phone as a point of contact (via text messaging).   The food here is usually pretty good, and I usually gravitate towards the specialties.  The salad could be a hit or miss... but I don't come here for the salad anyway.  Since their portions are all pretty sizable, with the complimentary bread, I usually skip the appetizers.  If you had to choose an appetizer, I am quite a fan of the lettuce wrap.  The cheesecake are all pretty amazing, that is if you still have room.  Anyway, all this stuff about the food is not news if you are a frequent CF customer, and they stay pretty consistent with any location. Seating, I usually pick indoor, or first-available if I'm hungry and desperate.  After eating there a few times, I realize I don't like dining outdoors.  The buildings surrounding the Americana can kind of make a mini wind tunnel.  It can get a bit cold during the fall-winter-spring months.  You might also experience napkins flying off your table.  Secondly, there's a lot of people walking around and if dining privacy/intimacy is something you might be looking for, then I'd recommend indoor seating instead.  If you don't want to wait, you could always try the bar area and find the first available seat. Service, I haven't really had any issues with the service of the several times I've been here.  I think I can only recall 1 instance in which we felt neglected... that was when we were dining outside and there was a big planter that blocked our visibility of the staff and vice-versa.  It is either we were just fortunate to have received good service, or we're just easy going dinner patrons, but I haven't experienced terrible service as I've seen in the other reviews. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this CF location and have picked this place as a dining default while at the Americana.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=540
Amy B.,"Canyon Country, CA",631,113,460,5.0,9/22/2014,"I am never disappointed when I leave here. At this location I normally like to eat outside on the patio. If seated outside you have a full view of the large fountain which is always running, and the opportunity to ""people watch.""  However today we choose to be seated inside (actually we told the host which ever seats were available first). I think being seated inside today was a great choice due to the heat. We came around lunch time on a Saturday, and although it was crowded we only waited 10-15mins.  I was delighted to discover their ""skinnylicious"" menu. They have organized the menu into four or five different sections based on calories in each of the following dishes. Ordering from this menu allows you to enjoy your meal guilt free. This was my first time ordering off this menu, I am not sure if it is a new addition for them, but I was left completely satisfied.  The best way to order, at any restaurant, is to order two plates to share. By doing so you have the opportunity to expand your culinary palate. We ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables and it was delicious. The carrots, offered on my plate, where huge and cooked to perfection; so moist and soft. The asparagus was also cooked perfectly and my favorite part was the absence of fatty oil.  We also ordered steak medallions (also on the skinny menu) and substituted the mash potatoes for more veggies. Delicious. Another friend ordered a salad from the same menu, it was huge! She could not finish it all... it looked very fresh and she said it was good. Today we opted for no cheesecake and I did not feel like I was missing out.  I will always love this restaurant and look forward to returning.

It's a bit loud and bustling, but I love it. The waiters are always friendly and accommodating, which is a plus. WHAT TO GET: 1. Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - It has a little kick to it, but it's bearable, I promise! The sauce reminds me a little bit of Indian curry. Soooo good. My favorite entree. 2. Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - The shrimp and chicken are bursting with flavor. If you're a fan of pepper, you'll love this. It has a rich peppery taste and the sauce is also amazing.

He set down the napkins and walked away. Came back and half heartedly told us the soup special. Then asked if we were ready to order. Really? We can't even get drinks first? Of course, with the way the night was going, it's not surprising our food was taking its time.  I should've asked for the manager but I didn't because it's my birthday and I didn't want to ruin it further by being negative.  The two stars is me being generous. Just like the tip.

Last night I was at an event at the Americana during rush hour, so I was basically stuck there.  There was a lot of free booze at this event--a VIP store opening--so I thought it would be best to suck up some food at The Cheesecake Factory.  My assessment:  1)  you always fill up on bread 2)  the portions are a good explanation of why America is filled with fat people  3)  the ambience and service is what you really go for.   Will I go back?  I always seem to go back...but not for a long time...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=540
Judith M.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,17,5,1.0,10/22/2015,"My parents came into town for a week and we were in the area so we thought this Cheesecake Factory would be a good choice since it was so conveniently where we were but boy were we wrong!  The hostesses are horrendous and very mean! It was a very hot Sunday and we only waited 25 minutes inside which wasn't bad at all. The bad part was after out timer lite up we got up from our seats and thought we would be seated right away, but instead they made us stand off to the side and wait for our table to be ready. 10 minutes of standing time had passed and my dad (who has a bad knee) was wincing. Since they made us get up (for no reason) after our timer lite up we had no where to sit for the remaining wait time. There was also a woman who had to be 7 months pregnant and her husband waiting for their table to be prepared after getting up when their timer went off as well.  I got a little frustrated and went up to the hostesses and asked when we were going to be seated stating that my dad had a bad knee and the 7 month pregnant woman shouldn't be standing unless the table was actually ready to have us seated. She turned to me, looked me up and down, sighed and said ""Well the tables aren't ready and I don't know how long it's going to be. They can wait a little longer."" She didn't even care at about the physical state of my dad and the poor pregnant woman! So appalling. I used to work in the service industry and that is not how you handle the situation at all. I then told her I just didn't understand why they buzzed us when they weren't even ready to seat us. She ignored me and just typed on the register. Then because I was annoying her they ended up seating me and my parents while they were still cleaning the table. The poor pregnant woman waited another 10 minutes to be seated and they were there before us!  Our waitress saved the day and made our meal more enjoyable but I still had a bad taste in my mouth that couldn't be fixed. I will never go to another Cheesecake Factory again and I will be advising my friends to eat at better managed places as well. The fact that the hostess thought she was better than everyone is just ridiculous.

I gave 1 star for the wait time, which was only 2 minutes, which was great and 1 star for our waiter, read and find out why. I was not too hungry so we ordered a shrimp Alfredo to share, and while waiting I realized that my small round plate was dirty. I didn't make a big deal about it, I just didn't use it. Then we noticed our forks were dirty, so my bf asks for another set. He brings 3 forks, and I'm assuming he didn't even take the time to check to see if they were dirty or not, because they were DISGUSTING. This all happened within the first 5 to 10 mins we were seated and that's how long it took for them to bring our food, which made me suspicious, is it fresh? Or not?  Usually the presentation of the food is nice but no not this time, because it seemed liked they didn't care that the sauce was all over the plate. Anyways, my bf asks for plastic utensils and our waiter forgets about that but he did bring 2 plates so we can share, and of course those were dirty as well. So our food is getting cold and my bf decides to go to the front and get the utensils. When we finally started eating,  the Alfredo sauce was very sweet and did not taste the same. I literally had 3 bites of it and I just couldn't force myself to eat more. This is why I probably will not return to this location, unless I'm with a group and I just sit and don't order anything.

It was a Friday evening at about 6pm.  I put my name in, and they quoted me about 40 minutes.  I received a text message after about 30 minutes, so good job on the time quote.   Things first started to get a little ""not so great"" after the host brought us to a table that was not yet cleaned and cleared.  There were dirty dishes all over. Despite the fact that there were many ""ready"" tables around us, he made us stand there for about 2 minutes while he cleaned it off.   The server than came over; however, came over so quickly, that we weren't even fully seated, ready to take our beverage order.  I enjoy prompt service, but possibly a little too prompt.  Our server also seemed embarrassed, shy, and awkward during the evening. The good news is that I had the Mac and Cheese Burger, which was pretty darn amazing.  Of course, always big portions, which means that I did not have room for Cheesecake.  :-( So, if it was based on location, food and decor, I would give it a 5.  However, a few somewhat significant slip ups made me give it a 3.  A few better improvements, could up this score significantly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=540

We got served in less than 10mins, fast for sure but I can tell you with the size of the menu and the number of items they are serving they are using frozen food.

Naomi W.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,41,,4.0,7/7/2017,"It's a tradition for me to come here every year for my birthday. The portions at Cheesecake never fail to disappoint. Our favorites include the orange chicken, meatloaf, Renee's special, most of their sandwiches, and the chicken piccata.  The ambiance is nice and dimly lit for a romantic atmosphere. Be warned, during dinner hours expect to wait 30-45 minutes for a table.  A disappointing downside is that they always seem to sit us at the back of the restaurant in the brunt ends of the booths facing the kitchen. It's been off putting a few times to be situated in the poor seats.  Also, Drake has those lyrics about ""why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake?"" Well, the last time we were there some spoiled teenagers created a commotion, yelling at the waitress and demanding service. It was distasteful and the manager had to come out and intervene.

So I tell our waitress, Nikki, that I have literally 20 minutes to order, eat, pay and leave!  She looked worried but handled it like a champ!! (THANKS NIKKI!!) So I ordered two mac n cheese and a chicken tenders.  She brought out bread while we wait for the food (which they downed, lol... We're Armenian, we love bread! lol).  Then she quickly brought out the food and off we go... made the kids stuff their faces as fast as possible. Which the food tasted freakin awesome!!  I got whatever the kids couldn't finish and put it in a box, paid and took off!   The food was awesome, the service was awesome, the ambiance/environment in this place is awesome... nothing I could complain about!  Its a wonderful spot!

Markie S.,"Montrose, CA",112,16,,1.0,10/21/2017,"Today was my worst experience in this dump. All I did is order ahead for takeout and they had me wait for an additional half an hour besides their ""estimated"" 20-25 minute preparation time. The hosts do not have a clue about what it is to accommodate their guests/clients. I asked them for assistance and all they did is brush me off. If you do not want to work in a busy restaurant then find some other occupation. No one has to deal with your unhappiness. Moving on, if you know that Saturday nights are your busiest especially at a location like the Americana...why would you only have one person manning the cash register??? Not only is he getting bombarded by unexpected questions but he also has to receive the attitude and bitchiness of annoyed guests. I feel bad for the poor man. I'm sure he's getting a pittance of wage. Lastly, I really don't understand what the point was of ordering ahead when by the time I got home...the food was as cold as dog's nose.

Brendan K.,"Glendale, CA",0,30,,1.0,1/30/2017,"This review is of their Sunday brunch service and is written in context of my having worked in restaurant management for 4+ years. If you're looking for a place for brunch, don't eat here.  Although Cheesecake Factory's evening service is usually passing, especially considering their high volume, their Sunday brunch service reeks of a non-committal attitude by the staff, broken management, and a dispassionate kitchen team.  In a single meal, the restaurant broke several best practice rules in restaurant operation, leaving me to believe the business is struggling with how to provide service during their non-peak hours. Burnt food, forgotten drink orders, cold potatoes, and a confrontational waitress round out a number of cardinal sins committed by the brunch team which will go down as one of the worst I've ever seen.  I could go into greater detail, but when the chef plates a charred english muffin under a cold eggs benedict, a server brings it to the table, and a manager still charges you for the meal, you've got serious back-end problems plaguing what could otherwise be an enjoyable, high quality brunch.   My advice to you is to go somewhere else. My advice to Cheesecake Factory is to expect more of yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=140

Whitney P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2786,365,400,4.0,8/7/2014,"If you want gain 10 pounds in one meal, this is a good place to start.  I've been to a million of these locations throughout my youth but have not been in years and years.   We actually came here to try some of the cheesecakes for our wedding.  We had a small backyard wedding only 14 guests so we were not going all fancy and having a huge expensive wedding cake.  What led us here was over the holidays my mom's friend brought over a lemonchello mascarpone cheesecake from Costco that was pretty much the best dessert I've ever had.  Costco only carries it during the holidays so it wasn't available for our wedding, so we searched and found a similar one here we wanted to check out. It's the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake, it was SO good, but not as good as the Costco one.  It was definitely good enough taste wise for the wedding but the way it looked whole didn't have a wedding cake look, so we went to the second runner up, the Red Velvet Cheesecake, which easily doubled as a casual wedding cake.  It was about $50 and we picked it up the day of the wedding. As far as food, I ordered the same thing I used to get when I was a kid, the Louisiana Chicken pasta, it never disappoints, but after about 5 pieces of bread, I can never finish even half of the portion, but it makes for a great doggie bag. The nice part about this location, which we like to refer to as the 'knock off Grove' since it's so very similar, but not quite, the Grove in West Hollywood by our house.  The one thing I did like better about this one was that while you sit outside at the Cheesecake Factory, you can get a great view of the fountain and watch the fountain dance along to the music and rainbows.  It's quite magical if you can forget about the mega mall type shops you're surrounded by in retail hell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=400

We always are pleased with the food at CF so we put our name down. At this CF they take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready which is nice.  This way you can roam around the Americana shopping area. Usually you are given a flashing pager and you can't leave the front lobby area so they texting method is nice. We went to Barnes and Noble for a bit and before you know it our table was ready.  Again the food here is great, come hungry because the portions are large. The menu usually has something for everyone in your group including kids. I had the fish and chips for the first time there and wasn't disappointed.  5 big pieces and lots of fries. The slaw was tasty too.  Service was great, our waiter kept out glasses full and checked in often even with the full restaurant.  Had to take some of our plates home but that's ok - lunch leftovers the next day. So much food no room for cheesecake.  Although when I do get cheesecake it's awesome.

As for the bad, this place seems mismanaged. When we got there, we were told it would be a few minutes before a table would become available. No problem. We are told the table is available but to stand off to the side. Okay, fine. Then, we move to another area and told that our table isn't ready yet. We wait a few minutes in this little walkway being constantly bumped into by employees and other people. Sure, the overall wait wasn't that long but it's incredibly annoying to go from seating comfortably out of the way to being right in the middle of everything and feeling bombarded. The other problem was that a woman and her daughter were walking around begging for money. I feel bad for the woman and her daughter but when I'm eating is really the last place I like to bother at. The woman went to a few tables and no one gave her money so other people don't seem to want to be bothered while eating as well.

Although it's not my go to, it's a decent place for dinner when selections are limited.  The food here is acceptable, portions are big, but the wait time was way below par. I felt like I was on a research paper assignment while deciding what to eat. This menu is enough for 15 standalone restaurants. I couldn't imagine being a line cook here. I ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms for an appetizer and the Shrimp Bistro Pasta, she got the Chicken Piccata.  We waited over 30 minutes for the food to arrive and then noticed that the Stuffed mushrooms never made it to the table.  I could've grown my own mushrooms in that time. The waitress apparently forgot to put it in the system and then blamed it on the kitchen. Now that's some high-class service. But I get it, I blame my farts on the dog whenever it slides by someones nose.  Aside from that, the food was okay. The Shrimp Bistro had good flavor but the texture could've been a bit crispier. I took a bite of the Chicken Piccata and enjoyed the citrus component of the dish. If it wasn't for the company, I'd give it 2 stars but we had some good laughs about it.

I didn't know this but they serve fresh strawberries with whipped cream. I don't exactly know what it is but their whipped cream is really good. It's not overly sweet and it's really fluffy.

Two of the dishes we got had hair in it. We were very nice about letting them know about it but all we were offered was a replacement plate. At this point two plates with hair in it didn't really earn our trust that other plates wouldn't have hair in it too. So declined the free food. We had 3 birthdays on our party and really didn't want to spoil the mood so we just left it at that. I think if we had made it a bigger deal we would have not had to pay for those plates.

There are plenty of tables and booths inside and a decent bar with several TVs to catch a game. We each started with refillable lemonade (raspberry and regular [approx. $4.50 ea.]) and water. Then, we moved onto the avocado egg rolls ($9.95), she the smokehouse BBQ burger w/fries ($11.50), and me the wild mushroom burger w/substitute sweet potato fries ($12.50). Complimentary bread is also served. Disappointingly, we didn't leave enough room for dessert and their scrumptious cheesecake, which is truly a sin. I usually like their lemonade, but this time it was a tad too sweet. I still contend that the best lemonade can be found at Red Robin. The avocado egg rolls (6 halves) are one of my favorite appetizers here and have never done me wrong. In addition, their burgers are also my favorite and one of the main reasons (along with the cheesecakes) why I dine here. The burgers are a good size and the side order of fries are plentiful. Needless to say, the portions are decent, thus, we just couldn't order dessert.  The service was shockingly good. I say this because historically I've had pretty shoddy service at each location I've dined at (e.g. Glendale, Beverly Hills, Pasadena, Sherman Oaks, The Grove, Woodland Hills). The hostess greeted us and immediate sat us down. And, our waiter (Daniel) was armed-and-ready to take our order. Our drink glasses were constantly filled, which is huge for me. A shutout to The Cheesecake Factory - please do whatever you can to maintain this type of service!  Parking is ample as there is an expansive parking garage (1 1/2 free parking then nominal fee after). Or, you can park at The Exchange (1 1/2 free parking then nominal fee after) a couple blocks away. Or better yet, park at the nearby Glendale Galleria across the street for free! Remember, I advocate walking whenever possible. Overall, I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, and honestly, there are only a handful of chains I truly like. The Cheesecake Factory offers a borderline experience for me. Although they have an extensive menu and I've tried items from all category selections, it really is about the cheesecakes. As much as I enjoy their burgers, I believe Red Robin's burgers are comparable if not better, at a better price and bottomless seasoned fries. Based on the prices quoted above (approx. $46.00 before tip), I feel the lack of value is prevalent. The atmosphere is casual, but please dress appropriately depending on the time of day you dine. Thankfully, they take my credit card of choice...AMEX!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=560

Today i came had lunch and it wasn't what i expected. I love the Cobb salad lunch special, but today it was not good at all! The lettuce was brown and it didn't look like it usually does. No tomatoes didn't look like a Cobb at all and the waitress poured vinaigrette dressing on it. I've had many cobbs here!

Christine M.,"Los Angeles, CA",320,8,3,5.0,8/26/2016,"Went in for my grandmother's birthday last night (8/25). Our Hostess Lexi was very SO helpful. My sis and my grandma were kinda being a pain in the *** about the seating. As a restaurant worker for many years, Ill admit I was a bit embarrassed. Lexi was super accommodating, and at the same time, did an awesome job of taking control and being proactive. Of course they had to have a table that was just used and super dirty, but we were sat within 3 minutes. She continuously stopped by to check up on us as she was passing. Bianca was our server. Outstanding, prompt service from beginning to finish. Loved Bianca's upbeat, friendly attitude. Never had to wait long for anything. Took care of our needs before we had to ask for anything. She did a great job of making my grandmother feel special on her night. My grandma couldnt stop talking about how impressed she was. (Believe me, that says a lot.) We were all so very pleased.

Grace S.,"San Diego, CA",32,88,483,2.0,3/3/2013,"This review is purely on the service. I love Cheesecake Factory food, and this location's food still lived up to its name. Anyway... I don't care how busy you are, once you sit me down, please remember that I am sitting there. This location was probably the busiest Cheesecake Factory I've been to, and considering how busy all the Cheesecake Factories I've been to are like, that is saying a lot. The line to put in your name goes out the door. Waiting time to sitting down is about 45 minutes. Once my friend and I were brought to our table, we sat there for possibly another ten minutes, fifteen minutes before someone came to ask us for our order for our drinks. In fact, other bigger parties were sat down and ordered before we were asked to. I'm not usually an impatient person, but seeing others order before us despite being sat down a long time before they were does not make me very happy. They did not automatically bring us bread either - we had to ask for it. The waitress, though very friendly, seemed to forget about us a couple of times, and then, when we decided to pack up our food and take it home since it was getting too cold out side to eat comfortably, they brought us boxes, but asked us to pack up our food ourselves. Normally, this would be fine, but seeing as every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to packs up your food for you, this was irritating as it was easy to create a mess trying to pack fairly full meals into these tiny boxes.  The two stars are for the food. The minus three stars is for the lack of service. Since it's not my normal destination for Cheesecake Factory, it's safe to say I won't be going out of my way to go here. A side note: My favorites are the luau salad, the tamale appetizer, and red velvet cheesecake. My friend also ordered the spring rolls with shrimp that was ultra delicious as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=560
Monica S.,"Sun Valley, CA",0,5,2,5.0,4/2/2015,Food was great   The service is great  actually while I had lunch there was a really rude lady made a scene aright next to my table bc they accidentally didn't have the table ready and yelled at one of the hostess. The lady was verryyyy rude and I have to say that the hostess acted so professional and apologized and acted so professional... I left pretty upset even though I had a great experience. Simply bc people don't need to be rude and if they're that picky they should take their attitude/rudeness somewhere else .

Wendy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,5,1,1.0,9/6/2016,"One of the worst customer service I experienced. First of all the wait time for your food to get there is ridiculous it's a Tuesday why does it take so long, I understand if it's a weekend but a Tuesday. Second the people next to me an behind me got there food before I did. Can I say I don't think it takes long to make 2 plates of spaghetti with meatball. Third I was trying to get someone's attention so I can ask why my food was taking so long while a server was looking my way that individual failed to acknowledge me despite me waving at them. After they arrived to our table she still came with an attitude and quickly brushed us off. Not until my husband stopped one of the waiters and requested to speak to the floor managers. Once he arrived he apologized and tried to make the situation better but the damage had already been done. I explained to the manager that the waiter that had approached our table was really rude and instead of coming to our table with an attitude she should had tried to make her best to find our waiter. Let me tell you this I will never come back to this location. Mind you I always go to the one at The Grove and never experienced this. They should maybe hire or train the waiters and waitresses how to properly speak to a guest and how to handle a situation that was so simple as to saying ""I'm sorry let me go find your waiter"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=560

The bartender is terrible!!! We ordered a passion fruit mojito and a long island they were mehhh as if it was a happy hour at a whole in the wall place with a bartender in training.. so we tried the berry mojito... even worse! I had to ask the waiter to bring me the sweetener... I'm a promoter for a nightclub so I know my drinks ;) I ordered the chicken madeira had no flavor but was ok after I added salt and pepper. My boyfriend ordered the cajun jambalaya pasta and it was terrible no flavor! Their was also a table accross from us who didn't even eat what she ordered and the waiter asked her if she wanted to take it home and she said no I didn't like it.

Albert A.,"Glendale, CA",9,31,6,1.0,9/23/2016,We went there to celebrate my son 14-th Birthday around 7:30 pm on a Thursday night. The host informed us that the patio is closed and the wait should be no longer then 20 minutes. We got are table around 8:15  45 minutes of waiting. Around 8:28 our clueless server came to take our orders. 3 sodas at $3.50 each took almost 15 minutes to arrive. I asked her can you please clean our table its greasy and sticky she said she will send some one to clean it but no one ever showed up. Dirty tables and booths and I guess no one cares and finally our food ( 2 pastas and a chicken sandwich) arrived at 9:15 after 45 minutes of waiting. When I asked her again no one cleaned our table yet she said sorry we are busy there is nothing I can do. Ha what a nice answer any way she dropped off our food and we didn't saw her until  she dropped off our check. Funny thing is first thing you will notice is percentage of tips already printed on the bill for you but guess what how about a 0% tip for not showing up and checking up on us young lady. The quality of food was horrible they didn't even use fresh garlic in pastas they used jar minced garlic which tasted bad really bad. And the chicken in the sandwich was dry and cold like been cooked hours ago I know a lot about food business you can't fool me. I used to go there a lot but lately in my past 3 visit I noticed that the service is going down and I'll not go there ever again. Over price poor service low quality food Rude servers.

Where is my food? Who knows while individuals who came after us are already eating. I had to ask a different server to please check on our food, a couple minutes later they brought it out.

This was my very first time at a Cheesecake Factory. I though what better place to have my first time be somewhere I've never been, The Americana. It was a Friday night so I was expecting a long wait time which by the way was supposed to be ""55 minutes"" that turned into 80! Finally we take our seat after 1.5 hours of waiting, yay!! Upon being seated we encounter Complaint Number 1: The table was sticky and clearly had someones meal still smeared on it. Luckily a busboy was near by and cleaned it right away. After meeting our server receiving our drinks and bread basket we encounter Complaint Number 2: We notice that one of us had some dirty silverware and asked to get it changed. After a rough start we receive some delicious food. Filling and very satisfying. After a great meal we head for a diaper change for Baby T. This is when we encounter Complaint Number 3: This restroom definitely set the bar. 4 small stalls and 1 big stall that has the changing table. World smallest restroom for such a big restaurant. No one is paying any attention to the restrooms at all because a teenage boy walked in to use the restroom with no problem. Not ok! The changing table had no liners as well as no way to safely retain my child to it either. The trash in the big stall and the paper towel wastebaskets were overflowing. There wasn't even any toilet paper the the big stall. The was hardly any soap the floors were filthy.

You run out of space.  And there was a small mix up of chicken Marsala vs pasta da Vinci (I ordered the latter for the party).  But both issues were resolved so well.  The manager was really great and he made sure to have a ton of waiters on hand for us.  I let the partygoers order their own cheesecakes at the end, the servers didn't give that many menus for people to look over, but overall the party was a success.  They can only host from 11-1 for a party this big, but if you ever needed a venue you could totally consider this.   The patio was great because kids could also run to the fountain and hang out for a bit  as well.  And just FYI, we ordered our favorites.  Pasta da Vinci, Santa Fe salad, Thai lettuce wraps, and bang bang chicken and shrimp.  All were made well and crowd pleasers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=660

Once again It was a disappointing experience. I have eaten at many Cheesecakes before and by far this location at the Americana is the worst. The waitress had a pleasant personality, however our food took a long time to come out, and when it did, it looked as though it had sat under the food warmer for at least 8 to ten minutes. My pasta was gummy and dry, with the sauce sucked out, and my guests potatoes on her breakfast dish were very dried out. The last persons dish was the best out of the 3, but the tacos were overly crisp and the meat looked dried out. We didn't have time to exchange things out because we were headed to a concert and couldn't wait. After reading many other reviews on this locations yelp page, I would hope that the management would take a more active role in the kitchen and dining room. Many things in the restaurant industry are forgivable ie, screaming kids (parents fault not the restaurants), Long wait (Welcome to Los Angeles deal with it, part of living here), Parking (Also part of just living in LA).  Now the ones that just can't happen if you want repeat customers is inattentive waitresses, overcooked or cold food, poor organizational skills, and constant mistakes. It's really not that hard for a customer like me. I am understanding, as I have worked in the food industry for 8 years, but this location seems to just flat out not care about a guests dining experience.

Laurice F.,"Los Angeles, CA",362,742,109,4.0,3/23/2012,"I go to Cheesecake Factory once in a blue moon. It's just not my style. It's a major chain that's always packed and with an absurdly large menu. With that being said, we did end up dining here last night to use up a gift card. We waited about 10mins or so before being escorted to our table. It's a huge place - my husband said it best regarding the decoration: ""It's opulent but without being classy."" So true! It's almost Vegas level, but even Vegas seems a little more unique. We were taken care of by our friendly - probably a model on the side - waitress. We started with a MARGARITA and RED SANGRIA which were both really good. The sangria was mine and I enjoyed the hint of cinnamon in each sip. We started our meal off with SWEET CORN FRITTERS. These came from the Small Plates & Snacks section and I was surprised to receive 6 decent sized fritters that came with a nice spicy aioli. Quoting my husband again (who btw has his own yelp account - hmph!): ""These fritters would make a smaller restaurant famous!"" So true again! Crispy, savory and sweet. Excuse the drool. Onto the entrees. Husband ordered the CHICKEN BELLAGIO - well-portioned and flavorful (especially the basil pasta). I had the GRILLED SHRIMP & BACON CLUB - along with shredded lettuce and a cream sauce, the grilled shrimp and bacon were great, though I was intimidated by the size of this sandwich since they stick another slice of toast in between the 2 proteins! It was a bit much, but still good. We were stuffed but decided to take home a couple of cheesecake slices - I got CLASSIC KEY LIME and he got the HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE BAR (0.25cents is donated to Feeding America). My key lime was yummy, but a little on the too-tart side. The Hershey's was just pure decadence. Both were impossible to eat in one sitting.

Divya G.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,189,26,3.0,2/26/2015,"This restaurant really isn't bad, I just was not extremely impressed by it. It's a really large space and if you come at the right moments the wait time for a table isn't longer than 10 minutes. The menu is super humongous so it's ridiculously difficult to decide what to order. I ended up ordering Pasta with Chicken and Scampi Sauce. It took a while to arrive at our table (about 30 minutes or so). The pasta and sauce were so heavy, but delicious. They went crazy with the chicken and the garnish though. There were so many pieces of chicken that I started thinking that I ordered Chicken with Pasta and Scampi sauce instead. Normally I wouldn't mind such a generous helping for the price paid, but the chicken was weird and bumpy looking on the outside (as if it still had skin on), not sure why. The herb garnish was so thick that it started to get in the way of the pasta at one point. Of course I had no room for dessert after that large plate of pasta--I couldn't even finish it!  The service here was alright. My friend and I split the bill--I paid part of it with card and she paid her portion with cash. The server made the mistake of assuming that my friend's change is his tip so he kept it and just brought back the receipt. I mean, there wasn't much change so it probably would have all been his tip, but assuming that right off the bat and keeping it is kind of annoying. He should have waited until she left the tip at the end instead.  Not a bad place for dinner once in a while, but the service and overindulgent portions of heavy food will probably keep me away from here for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=680

At first my visit seemed like a normal one, I go to the Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena occasionally and enjoy it. I ordered my normal small plates, I really enjoy the small plates menu because then I can try a bunch of different things. So I ordered chicken samosas, crispy crab bites, and loaded potato bites to share with my mother. They were tasty as usual but we had small appetites so we decide to take some things home with us. We had a few crab bites left and the great majority of a LARGE plate of loaded potato bites left over. I thought ""Oh great I'll have an entire meal for later."" The server offered to take the food and wrap it up for us, I replied yes and several minutes later he arrived with our take-home container.  The next day while at home I took the container out of the refrigerator, eyes filled with glee, excited about my lovely loaded potato bites waiting for me. This is where things took a turn. When I opened the container my heart dropped and my stomach growled. There were only 4 potato bites inside the container. I HAD AN ENTIRE PLATE LEFTOVER, I had been cheated. The server had taken my food to the back and either dropped it, eaten it, or just plain threw it out. I DO NOT enjoy paying for things I will never get to eat. TOTALLY CHEATED.

This location in Glendale always seems to be crowded.  To our surprise, we were seated in less than 30 minutes.  The vibe in this restaurant is mostly young and fun.  However, it's hard to have fun on an empty stomach, so we started to place our orders immediately.  Miguel started by ordering a Stone IPA (Indian Pale Ale), which is a drink I'd never heard of.  I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade.  In terms of food, Miguel opted for the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, which consists of shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic in a spicy cajun broth with steamed rice in the center.  All I can say is the food looked delicious when I saw it brought to the table, as it was totally devoured shortly after being placed on the table.  As for my order, I opted for the Spicy Cashew Chicken, which is spicy fried chicken with green onions and roasted cashews that's served on a bed of rice.  The spicy flavor of the chicken was guiltily pleasing to my palate, as it's been over a year since I've had this dish.  Our meals were satisfying, plentiful, and affordable, as each dish was less than $20. All in all, everyone can find something satisfying on the menu at the Cheesecake Factory.  Our server was friendly, the service was good and, again, the food was good.  Given the big portions of food, we couldn't fathom the idea of getting dessert.  The desserts alone can easily be a meal, as they're served in big portions too!  We enjoyed our visit to this Cheesecake Factory!    *3.5 Stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=680

The only problem was that half of our group was running on Filipino time, so they were an hour late, but we didn't bother waiting because that always happens, so we just ordered all our food and appetizers. We got Thai lettuce wraps and calamari as appetizers. I split grilled salmon with my sister and my mom had fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and roasted tomatoes.  The Calamari came with Garlic Dip & Cocktail Sauce. The Calamari itself was crunchy and perfectly cooked. I really don't like getting cocktail sauce with Calamari, so I stuck with the garlic dip. The lettuce wraps were very large and came with strips of chicken satay. I kind of wish the chicken would be more chopped up though. It'd just make it easier for the lettuce wraps and make it so you can have more servings. They were very good though. It came with a lot of toppings which were all very fresh. The Grilled Salmon was delicious! It was a big portion and more than enough to split between me and my sister ( ).

Francine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1577,1658,3141,2.0,7/18/2011,Wow I can't believe the service I had gotten at this Cheesecake Factory !!! I really like The Americana and I always come here to just walk around and do a little bit of browsing. The other day I was feeling like eating Cheesecake Factory since I haven't step foot into one in a long long time after many horrible experiences.  I don't know why or how it goes about but I always always end up with a kid that just started training! This guy needed a lot of help and his fellow staff members didn't help him one bit.  We were sitting for refills on drink forever and even ordering took forever. He already had three tables and seemed like it was too much to handle. People are demanding yes and people want things fast especially for lunch time.  Our Waiter was nice and sweet but I think if he is still new that they should also get help from another member of the staff. So things will run more smoothly.  I ordered a lunch portion meal which was huge and I ended up not finishing half of it. But the food was alright I  think it just was killed by the lack of service and attention to us.  I think I can live without coming to another Cheesecake for awhile.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=700
Nathan C.,"San Francisco, CA",560,42,2,3.0,12/28/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory did have some good food, but it was definitely not delicious enough that I would wait for about an hour with my friends to eat lunch at. Granted, it was great that Americana had other stores that I could shop at while waiting, but when you are in a state of immense hunger, this doesn't satisfy. I don't remember the pasta dish I ordered, but it was spicy and had chicken (I think it was Louisiana Chicken Pasta?). The dish was pretty good, but again, it took quite a bit of time for the food to come out. My friends ordered other pasta dishes and theirs looked good as well. The food is quite heavy like other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, so ordering the minimum is a good idea. The Avocado Rolls are quite delicious and I would recommend these for appetizers.

Cold, hard and bland.. did not tastle like the bread I had at any other cheesecake factory. The  black bread that they serve is usually phenomenal, but for some reason todays bread was very dry.. About 20 minutes after theu brought the bread, Atiffany came and took my order. I ordered 2 kobe beef patties on a plate of salad. I asked for medium.................. and asked Tffany to make sure it is medium.......... after 55 minutes waiting for 2 beef patties, Tiffany came by with the plate.. sure enough, it was well done. They tried telling me it was medium well, but it was clearly well done as there was not even a small hint of red. I told her I hate it, and the ""manager"" came out.. Hello, whats wrong? Said the manager(like you would to a baby) i said I hate it.. i told him I would not eat a well done patty when I specificslly asked for medium.. his response??

When we finally got his attention he said ""I'm too busy to do that next time tell me at the beginning"". So we were left to split the bill five ways by ourselves. So we get it all written out and give him EXACTLY what we want on each card, and he messed it up. He put $72 on a card that was suppose to have $20. How do you mess that up????? So we spent 1 1/2 with managers and the waiter figuring things out. A WHOLE HOUR AND A HALF. Really? All because he was too lazy to split the check. I understand it was National Cheesecake Day, but you don't let your customer service falter.

We told her we were in a rush so we wanted to order our dessert with our meal, so she independently decided to help out by bringing out our check early (with our dessert) as well. We tipped well to show our appreciation. Common sense is way underrated nowadays. I love it when people realize that bothering customers 10+ times to see if ""everything was alright"" is a little ridiculous. Thank you, Malia for realizing that. Parmesan herb crusted chicken was to die for! Fettuccine alfredo pasta was just okay. Ultimate red velvet cheesecake was amazing! My only complain: way, way too pricey.

Change my clothes and shoes and get back... And .... Still no food. Clock was about 21 and we had 3 kids that were pretty tired. 2 hours and 30 mins our food starts arriving, but not for all at once, so some of us are done before the last ones have had any food at all. Some of the food is mixet up with others customers orders, and some of it is way overcooked and dry, probably because of the long wait.  When we left we were told we could have 2 pieces of cheesecake... And the waiter insisted on a tip... What a nerve. Everything was terrible and then still wanting extra money.

Jenine S.,"Los Angeles, CA",315,36,15,1.0,11/23/2016,"11/23/2016. The day before thanksgiving. My boyfriend and I ate the Cheesecake Factory in Glendale. We arrived at the bar at 10pm (an hour before closing). We were waited on by VINCENT. Knowing the risks associated by sitting at the bar (low, minimum face to face interaction) we were ready to just order and eat. I myself ordered a Kobe burger and my boyfriend ordered chicken tikka masala, along with two pineapple Moscow mules. There was another couple next to us, also at the bar, who arrived AFTER us and got their bread basket arrived BEFORE us. That was the first red flag- starving as we were, we were quick to notice this discrepancy.  Brushing it off and attributing it to being ""rush hour"" for serving/dinner time, we disregarded this.  What really pushed our buttons was not being asked how our meal was AT ALL, NOT ONCE after receiving it. We are both servers, so we understand how it gets when it's busy, but when you ask the couple next to us who arrived AFTER US how their food is, we take it personally. We usually tip 30% and LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but will probably NOT be back after this experience. Living in LA, there are plenty of better options.

Service was friendly at the bar, i swear, I don't know why anyone would wait for a table here when there are lovely gathering height 4-tops, booths and seats at the bar for no wait with the SAME FULL MENU!

Ppl next to us were very loud and we kindly asked to seat in a different place (there were plenty table empty during the day). The server refused and gave us a look.  We decided to change seats ourselves. The host came and told us to go back to the old seats.  My husband called the manager. The manager showed up and told us that if we don't seat at that table, we are welcome to leave.. At that point we were out of words...

James K.,"San Diego, CA",472,370,602,3.0,6/6/2015,"First time at this location, but not the first time at Cheesecake Factory.  To sum it up, great food but average service.  It was a Friday afternoon so it was pretty busy.  I asked how long the wait and they told us 15-20 minutes.  That was fine and they use your mobile number to notify you of your seat so you can go out walking around if you want.   Once we received the text, I went up to the counter and they told us to ""hold on"".  It's odd because why send me the text if you aren't ready to take us.  I realize some people may have left the restaurant but it seems most hang around so when you send the text, I would think you would be ready.  We stood by and noticed many other people and some groups coming up and getting seated.  After watching about a half dozen other people get seated, we went back up to let them know we were texted about the seat.  They looked at us a little confused and it seemed as if they had given our seat away to another couple.  However, they finally took us back to a table that hadn't been cleared.  I certainly don't mind waiting for a table to be cleared because it's only a few minutes.  But the isle is so tight, we had to stand right over someone else's table and I felt bad for those people trying to eat.   Ultimately we were seated and our server came out and took our drink orders.  When she came back with our drinks, we already knew what we wanted and placed our orders.  I had the club sandwich with a side salad.  I'm a big club sandwich lover and when they delivered it, it simply looked spectacular.  Three slices of white bread with a generous portion of fresh turkey (not processed).  Lettuce, nice full strips of bacon and tomato.  Cut into quarters as is traditional and there was a small cup of fries that came with the sandwich.  I bit into the sandwich and it was SO good!  Normally I'll eat half the club sandwich and take the rest with me but this time I ate the whole sandwich it was that good.  If I were to make a comment, it would be the tomato.  They put too much tomato and they should try buying fresh tomato's from a farmers market or something because these were not quite ripe.  I pulled off the excess tomato and it was perfect.   I had iced tea to drink and it was fresh brewed tea!  So great especially when so many other places use instant tea for their iced tea.  We decided to take some slices of the strawberry cheesecake to bring to our friends we were going to see after dining here.  Our server brought out the cheesecake slices in individual plastic containers (recyclable) with forks and napkins for each slice.  The only problem was when we finally got to where we were going, the cheesecake slices looked more like pudding!  The containers for the cheesecake slices are way too big for a single slice and they must have moved around quite a bit while driving.  The car was air conditioned so it wasn't a heat problem.  But it's shocking since the car is a luxury car and the ride was smooth.  Of course it tastes the same, but it just looked terrible when I went to give these to our friends. If you were reading closely, you might have noticed I mentioned a side salad and yet didn't talk about it at all. That's because they never brought it and I didn't realize this until long after we had left.  But of course, they did charge us for it.  I hope our server is enjoying the 20% tip we left her!!!  She did provide good service but it was reflective of our overall service at this restaurant.  Cheesecake Factory is known for being slammed all the time at every location I've ever visited so this isn't anything new for them.  But to forget about us after notifying us that our table is ready, taking us to a dirty table and our server forgetting the salad.  Very unsatisfactory.  The only reason I give the three stars and not lower was because the food was very good.  Our server was very friendly and for the most part, very attentive.  If it weren't for the missing salad, I would say she was perfect.  Frankly, I don't really mind so much except that I was charged for the salad and ended up paying for it.  If she had realized (which she should have) she could have taken it off the bill.  Last, I'm so happy they use recyclable containers for the cheesecake, but try getting a bit smaller so the slices to move around so much and end up looking pudding when you get home.   Good place to eat when you are shopping here and I would probably go back to a Cheesecake Factory just for the club sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=280

Good thing we checked our silverware before using it, one of the forks was dirty. Our food runner grates cheese over our pasta and drops a giant chunk of the cheese on our table, all he said was ""oops"" and didn't even bother pick-up the cheese and just left. I also saw another food runner dropped some pieces of chicken tender as he was deliver the plate to a table, he noticed that he dropped some of the food but just kept on walking.

On a good day, I'll get the Cobb Salad... But that breakfast - The Breakfast Sandwich that my mom introduced me to is amazing. As is the Monte Cristo that you can land during brunch sundays. Sit at the bar, and you can watch some sports during a nice breakfast. For the price, it's really reasonable - You think about how much you pay at a smaller joint and the quality isn't as high, and it's not nearly as reliable.

Paeng M.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,138,151,3.0,8/4/2015,"So I'm a fan... and in full honesty I've only ever had cheesecakes from here, I've never actually ate here.  So this past Sunday, we randomly did and the food was surprisingly really freakin' good. For appetizer we got the fried zucchini, avadodo, and portobello mushroom basket. Seriously, no regret it was fantastic. I've only ever had fried avocado at a bar in hollywood and it's been years, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this on the menu and had to get it. For dinner, my friend had the crusted salmon/ mash potatoes (they don't do roasted potatoes)/ and esparagus (lunch size). He loved it and it filled him up, so also surprisingly they were not at all greedy with their lunch portion. I had the mushroom burger with side salad. Vinagrette on the salad was light and not to sour or sweet, this is a total plus. my burger was B- because the bottom patty was soaked in grease and juice, however the texture was there for the rest of the burger and that's another plus. Even the bread they give you when you first sit down is really good... or maybe I was that hungry. Anyways, to sum this up, I would go again. Price was average for a $$ rating.  Why the 3/5 stars?  MENU needs to be edit down, a little overwhelming.  An even though they were way busy and not to blame our first server for ending her shift and the new server stepping in (though I felt like there shouldn't have been a 25 min gap from taking our drink orders and taking our food orders - - I get it, everyone was busy), it didn't help seeing a BUNCH of the waitresses just texting on their phones and socializing with each other. Why did I notice this, because I and tables around me were really waiting for a fair amount of time to be helped out. And trust me, they have a ton of people working there, maybe only a handful of the waiters looked stressed-out-busy.

We wait, and wait....and a waitress comes by to greet us and take drink orders. 4 waters and a Diet Coke takes 20 minutes to come back to us, and the waitress tells us she's handing us off to a colleague. That's fine, we'd just like to order food please. He tells us he'll be ""right"" back. We shouldn't have let him leave. He returns another 15 minutes later to take our food order. Mind you, a few managers have shown up on the floor to start directing patrons to tables and put out fires between servers. I don't know what was going on, but it seemed extra chaotic and somewhat unprofessional being that we were watching these conversations unfold before us.  Food comes out half an hour later, no joke, and with apologies from the server and the manager who accompanied him to our table. We ate very fast as we had limited shopping time and didn't think this ordeal would take so long.  Asked for boxes to pack up what we couldn't eat and our waiter offered to do it for us. We politely declined since we assumed that would take another 30 minutes. Almost...we had to wait another 15 minutes for our boxes and the check.

Mistake. Our waitresses were not attentive at all. She said she would bring bread while we selected our dishes. We waited. We reminded. She gave us some excuse about it being baked fresh and went over to chat with Jennifer B, another waitress. They gabbed, they bitched loudly about some customer, they checked their phones and receipts. After asking again, we finally got our soggy, cold bread after we got our meal. No apologies. No fresh baked bread. Our waitress never returned. No explanation that she went on break or wherever. We were just suddenly served by Jennifer B who gave us minimal attention.  Staff, Omar, was the only saving grace. He was kind, attentive when asked for something (mustard) and worked feverishly.

Now when I order this dish I have discovered... thin skinny pasta and not even spicy hot. the chicken bland and just added to the sauce. when I ask it make it spicier  A. they don't B. The answer to that was let me bring you some pepper flakes, which he didn't bring.  but regardless pepper flakes is not the same hot as the cayenne pepper hot that the dish is made with and just needs more of.  so I guess you can not add to a dish that is already pre prepared  back in the day the dish was prepared together not place item on top and ad sauce. and very little sauce at . the waiter brought us more sauce from the start due to he said "" I brought you extra sauce since everybody want's more sauce""  if the demand is more sauce to each customer why are you serving dry pasta on a wet pasta dish???? my husbands dish completely different menu item the chicken tasted just like my chicken . bland . it seems like chicken is just boiled in salt water and added to any dish as needed.  As for this location......  fake friendly. what  I mean is lots of OH Yes no worries. still lots of mistakes.  no consideration, no jump to make things better. sloooowwwwww service. we were there 2 hours just waiting. waiting for a table , waiting for food, order was no shrimp , shrimp arrived waited for new order, just too much. many times our experience is the same. A ~just we are the cheesecake factory well oiled machine that is going to make our money anyway so we do not care about customer service~  I find in the marina del ray location the ambiance and feel and customer service is more pleasant . going to try Pasadena next hope its better than Glendale location.

Shirley W.,"Alhambra, CA",300,219,577,4.0,2/18/2015,"This location has the best service of all Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  It was jam packed on the rainy Saturday night, we had to settle with the bar area since we were starving and don't want to wait 45 minutes. The servers were tentative, and made some great suggestions on what to order. I had the skinnylicious angle hair with shrimp, my friends ordered the meat ball lasagna with prosciutto, and pamersan chic hen pasta.  The portion of the food from the regular menu is huge, I would call it family sized. The skinny menu is perfectly portioned for one, and they do use a yogurt instead of heavy cream for the white sauce. That compromised the flavor quite a bit, so I was not super happy with the taste, but it only has 500 calories. In comparison, the regular menu with full on ingredients are much tastier--I could taste the generous olive oil and heavy cream and cheese topping. The flat bread with pear and blue cheese was delicious, and of course we had to end the meal with a lovely slice of white chocolate macadamia cheese cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!!! Speaking of an happy ending! Will definitely recommend the restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=380

The wait wasn't long (like 5 minutes) for 2 people. The food was just as good as the one at the other locations but the thing that ruined our lunch was the waitress. She was very passive aggressive and seemed like she didn't want to attend us. Mind you, she only came to our table a total of 5 times. To greet us and take our drinks, to bring us our drinks, to take our order, bring the food, and then for the bills. Not once did she ask if we needed a refill on our drinks nor did she check up on us.  I had ordered a San Pellegrino and my friend ordered an iced tea. My San Pellegrino didn't come with ice. At other locations, ice is always provided but this time it wasn't. Then when we got our food we never saw her come to us. She went to the other tables, started conversation with the other guests, but to us she wouldn't even look at us. 10 minutes past by after we were done with our meal and she came and asked if we wanted the bill. We wanted dessert but after playing the waiting game we decided to go to sprinkles instead of cheesecake.  The blonde waitress with tattoos introduced herself as sky but the name on the bill said Brittni, and another waitress said my waitress name was Tiffany.

I asked the waiter if there had been a menu change, to which he replied simply ""yes"".  I told him I was very disappointed in the iceberg lettuce - nobody I know likes it anymore - had anyone else complained?  ""No.""  I asked, hypothetically, ""Why would they change a thing like that?!""  He replied, ""It was a decision by corporate."" So there you have it.  Worthless non-nutrition.  Tasteless food.  Not the best way to make money -- this place used to have lines out the door - 45 minute waits - and for good reason.  Now -- well I'm not giving them another chance.  It only takes one lousy meal to lose a long-time customer forever. PS-I asked him if they still had baby greens, to which he replied, yes they did (that and romaine (which is similar to iceberg, only slightly better in nutrition) and I asked him if he could bring me a small bowl of it and then I would be satisfied.  I was given a bowl of romaine.  I don't think he or the kitchen even knew what baby greens are anymore.  I could taste the fillers in my daughter's meatballs (breadcrumbs and low-quality beef with gristle) as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=380

First off, this place is a zoo. It is not organized, people here are rude too. Luckily our wait was not too long and the table accommodated my daughter and her stroller. We were seated outside and it was a nice, warm night. No complaints until we met our waiter. This guy didn't seem to know anything and had zero personality. Granted, he could have been new, but really, he didn't know ANYTHING.  I asked if they validated, he said he didn't know. I ordered a to go meal for my husband and wanted to order a small cheesecake to take home, not a slice, and he told me that the small cheesecakes were $30 to $40. I really should have checked online (why the hell don't they list dessert prices on the damn menu?) because they really were $23. I wasn't going to spend the price that he stated on that cheesecake so I passed. But I have to ask, what kind of a waiter doesn't know what a small cheesecake is? Before our price conversation happened he actually came out with just a slice of cheesecake to go. That was NOT what I asked for. So much for listening skills. He also had major attitude when he was asked if we could have a side of lemon wedges for our iced tea, as he served us all iced tea without any lemons at all. I ask again, who does that? We were each given a side of lemon wedges on a cocktail napkin and not in a small dish or bowl. Service was turtle slow, it took him a half hour to bring us our checks. When he was asked to put my to go order on a separate check, he got confused and put it all on the same check and asked us to put numbers by what was on each check. Really now.

It was an hour and a half wait on a Saturday night (kind of expected judging by the older reviews). With that said the waitress was great but the food not so much. I've never tasted fettuccine alfredo so bland before. Such a huge disappointment. The sauce was watery on both the fettuccine and the marina sauce for the mozzarella appetizer, which I wasn't impressed with either.

After, when we took a few bites we asked for the check and I wrote down that the soup and salad was on my card and the burger on another, she still got it wrong and I had to get the manager for the second time to charge us the correct amount, I'd get it if we were a big group but it was literally just us two and the soup was cold by the time I got it but after waiting 40 mins for it, I didn't even want to wait anymore.

Rose S.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,215,430,3.0,7/15/2012,"Surprising I have not wrote a review of this place yet. Well here it is.  Went here with my bff, bff's brother and his girlfriend for dinner. Normally this place is ok to eat out sometimes if I want to get some cheesecake or eat their bread. This location is kind of bad because well it gets extremely crowded on weekends except for when we came. I expected at least 10-20min wait but I was wrong it was more like a 5min wait.  Our waiter I think his name is Brandon/Brendon or something like that. He was nice and very patient with us when we were waiting for my bff's brother. He also had a very energetic feel (I like). Although it felt like we were a bit ignored when we wanted more bread or wanted to order some cheesecakes.  So I love love love their bread so fresh and so good lol. For starters the bff wanted some wontons, so she got 'Chicken Wontons'. it was good but it was also way to salty. High in sodium anyone? So here were our entrees  Mine-  The Stuffed Chicken Tortilla no cilantro smothered with cheese on top and tomatoes with black beans and a corn bread topped with sour cream. This meal was GREAT! Normally when I come here I get something fried or pasta good thing I did not make that move. I would gladly recommend this dish and would get it again when I come back. BFF - Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, she seemed to enjoy it a little except for the toasted coconut flakes on top. Although she kept staring at every ones food. It displayed with a massive amount of rice (brown) in the center than surrounded with fried chicken and like 5pcs of shrimp topped with toasted coconut flakes. In my opinion it looked good but I did not try.  BFF's bro gf - Grande Burrito Factory - this thing is HUGE, (I know because the bf got this before). So she seemed to enjoy it a little too. She complained that it had way too much rice in it which I kind of agreed. She gave my bff one end of the burrito and it contained mostly rice than anything else.  BFF's bro - the most expensive meal out all of us. Herb Crusted Salmon & Shrimp, for a $20 meal I would find this as a disappointment. For that price you can get more for your buck elsewhere even with those options. Salmon was like 3 little pieces and well this wasn't your average size shrimp they normally serve - more like a little bigger and only got 4pcs. Mashed potatoes right on the center and asparagus on the side. I wish I could've took a picture of this food.  After getting our grub on, we waited for quite some time for me get a to go box and for our waiter to let us order some cheesecakes. Was also another wait to get our check. It was busy but it was not extremely busy.  Overall our waiter was very helpful and happy to be there even though we got a little ignored. Pointers when he noticed our drinks and gave us new glasses. That was awesome!  P.S. I got the Red Velvet cheesecake to go and I was very disappointed. It was too sweet for my palette and the red velvet was not as red as I like it to be. It also did not seem so flavorful. That was a disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=840

I asked the waiter to turn on the heater as soon as we got seated, he said he'll get someone to come by and close the umbrellas down so they can turn it on.  He got our drink orders, and I asked him to bring us the balsamic vinaigrette with the bread... He forgot to bring it, but got it with the second basket of the bread when we reminded him. =] (we were nice about it too) Ordered the Nachos....  After about 20 min the waiter came by and said they had messed up the order so if we wanted a cup of the soup of the day while we waited, and he was very nice about it. We took his offer and got the lentil soup (he brought us a bowl instead of a cup) Then the Nachos came...  WOW! Never have I had Nachos that taste so horrible. The cheese was not melted, there was barely any ingredients on it. It was just so bland.  The BF and I NEVER EVER EVER complain about the food that we get. It has to be sooooo horribly wrong that we MIGHT say something...  Bf said ""I don't mean to be sounding rude or offend YOU in anyway, but could you tell the chef that this was by far the worst nachos we've ever had. It had no taste what so ever, so we were dipping the chips into the soup to get some flavor"" Nice waiter apologized and came back saying the chef said he would be happy to make another one, we said it was ok and we just wanted to mention it. Then he left and came back and asked us to order something else so they could make it up to us.. .we just got a Tiramisu and IT WAS FANTASTIC.... we were planning on getting it anyways.. =]  Bill came, he had only charged us for the nachos...  soup, dessert, nachos  plus tax = $13!!!!!

Julia D.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,42,6,4.0,4/12/2013,"So, of course I've been here a million times before as a carnivore and also as a vegetarian but yesterday was my first time as a vegan. To start, I got the moscato wine (yum!!) and a guacamole appetizer with my boyfriend. I didn't eat the tortilla chips (wasn't sure if they were vegan) but the guacamole was satisfying. For my meal I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wrap with no chicken/portabello mushrooms instead. When I said ""no chicken"" to my waiter, his eyes nearly popped out of his head and he was in such a state of disbelief that a person could not want chicken in their meal that he had to ask me again, ""so, that's no chicken?"".  None-the-less, it was surprisingly very, very tasty. Sadly, thats about the only vegan thing on their menu! The Skinnylicious Veggie Burger sans the mayo and cheese might be vegan, but that depends on the ingredients in the bread.

John T.,"Glendale, CA",2,7,,5.0,2/7/2015,"Went to Cheesecake Factory at Americana for lunch with a couple of friends.  The waiter, who was absolutely fantastic, suggested we try some of the new additions to their menu.  We agrees to order a few and split them among us.  First was the Eggplant Parmesan.  Was the closest recipe to my grandmother homemade eggplant that I've ever had!!  Amazing!!  With a side of Angel Hair pasta with pesto that is to die for!!  I cannot recommend this enough! Next we tried they new pulled pork sandwich with bacon!  The meat was juicy and lean.  Melted in your mouth with a BBQ sauce that had just the right amount of ""bite"" to it.  The thick cut, smoked bacon just added to the flair!!  A must order if you're a fan or BBQ or pulled pork! Next up we the Imperial Chicken and Shrimp dish.  This is very similar to their version of Orange Chicken and Shrimp.  Big generous pieces of both and the rice was very flavorful .  This was yet another winner and was completely devoured!! Finally we had the Herb Crusted Chicken Filets with a side of mashed potatoes.  Made to perfection!!  You could cut the chicken with your fork and the lightly crusted herb topping was perfect!!  The mashed potatoes were home style and chunky!!  With such a huge selection to choose from it's always nice to try something new!!  I highly recommend any of the four items above and out service could not have been any better!!  An all around enjoyable experience and one that will keep me coming back many times again!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=840

Lured by the gimmick (like those 'buy more to save more' ones), we decided to take advantage on the discount on dessert.

I thought Outback was the spot for steak but I was mistaken. The wait was about 7 minutes long and we got a nice booth seat. I ordered a strawberry lemonade and I have to admit it was probably one of the best strawberry lemonades I've ever had. They put a ring of sugar around the glass and fill it up to the top with fresh tasting lemonade.  I ordered a ribeye steak cooked medium and it came with an order of fries. Usually I have to ask the server if I can substitute for fries but I was delighted to see that it was already included in my meal.    My steak was cooked to perfection and the fries were kind of cold but they reminded me of room service which was really good. The server was great, she kept filling up my strawberry lemonade to the top. I think I had about three or four total. For dessert I had an epic tasting strawberry cheesecake topped with real strawberries and whipped cream. I could barely finish the cheesecake but me being me I had to push myself to it and I ate every single bite! This is probably the best cheesecake factory I have been to in my life.

Walter C.,"Los Angeles, CA",429,55,88,4.0,7/13/2011,"Review: HAPPY HOUR (not dinner or any other dining time) I love their HH. It's Monday thru Friday from 4-6PM. The servers seem like they are kind of out of it sometimes. There is this one girl...she takes forever. She will walk around your table like a dozen times and each time that you try to get her attention, she gives you that lil motion about oh i'll be back. Never mind her. Avoid that one. She isn't of any help. She's the reason that I give my review 4 and not 5 stars.  I like their vietnamese tacos. They are bomb, with the pork belly and sauce on top. SOOOO damn good. The buffalo blasts are HUGE. So, if you are looking for something to share, that would be perfect. The potstickers aren't bad in their tamarind sauce but there aren't that many of 'em in there. I think there were 5 in the order that was $5. I could get a whole bag of 'em for $4 at trader joe's. But, if that's what you're craving then go for it. They are tasty.  Drink Specials are $5.00.  They have mojitos, JW Pink Lemonades, Long Islands and probably a few others but those are the ones that our friends usually order. The JW Pink Lemonade is tasty and has a nicely sugared rim. It's like the minute maid lemonade with a TINY kick. The mojitos are muddled just enough and the bartender is a pretty good pour, same with the Long Islands.  I'd suggest you get her a lil before 4PM. That way you should have a pretty good chance at getting a table or a seat at the bar.

It was not chewable and no it wasn't dry something was just wrong with it. I was chewing chewing chewing and I couldn't swallow it! Then finally I drank water and somehow took my food down. Then my friend had the same exact problem. We both ate a little but got really disgusted! Oh and as a matter of fact it was not even busy. So I'm curious why my sandwich was made so poorly.

Other comments: They don't have a dedicated staff member to take phone orders.  It's a person at the bakery multi-tasking between phone orders, plating desserts, making change for the servers, and taking orders from customers at the restaurant.  So, calling ahead with your order can be frustrating sometimes because they place you on hold for a long time.   A better option is to place your order at the restaurant and chill near the fountain or walk around outdoors until your order is ready.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=860

Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2742,19397,2.0,6/29/2011,"***This location in the Brand at Americana seems like any other Cheesecake Factory out there; for dessert, it would probably be better to opt for one of their cheesecakes rather than their ice cream desserts*** We went here for dessert after a meal at nearby Raffi's.  I am not the biggest fan of cheesecake so I opted for one of their ice cream desserts instead.  I went with their hot fudge sundae, which was vanilla ice cream topped with hot fudge, whipped cream and almonds. Everything about it was okay, but it was not one of the better sundaes out there.  The ice cream was a little too whipped and light and did not have the firmness and density I prefer.  The hot fudge was okay and the almonds were crunchy.  The whipped cream seemed similar to what you would get from a canned whipped cream. I have had their cheesecakes (at other locations) and while they are very dense and filling, they are probably a better option than their hot fudge sundae. Service was pleasant but a little slow and disorganized on our visit.  I haven't been to that many Cheesecake Factories lately so I am not sure if this is a common thing.  I remember the service at the Cheesecake Factory in Sherman Oaks being more efficient. The atmosphere was like any other Cheesecake Factory (a more upscale atmosphere than a lot of the chain restaurants out there).  And like other Cheesecake Factory restaurants, it was very busy. While I did not try their regular menu here, I imagine the overall experience would be similar to other Cheesecake Factory locations, which probably makes this a safe option for Cheesecake Factory fans.  If you are not a Cheesecake Factory fan but are in this area a lot, you may want to consider giving nearby Palate a shot (a good upscale Glendale restaurant). This Cheesecake Factory is located right in The Brand At Americana There are many parking structures nearby (some are paid and some are not).  We opted for the Glendale Galleria parking structure, which is free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=940

For starters we got the spinach artichoke dip and the fried mac and cheese.  OMG, the friend mac and cheese was so amazingly good.  The cheeses they used in the pasta was strong and powerful, yet the dish still carried that delicious fried flavor.  On the other hand, the spinach artichoke dip was just so-so.  I thought it lacked flavor, but that might have been due to the mac and cheese being so strong.  Personally, I really like the spinach artichoke dip from Claim Jumpers the best.  My main course consisted of a delicious, well seasoned turkey burger and fries.  Don't be fooled by the word ""turkey.""  Though, I picked this dish to be a little more healthy, it was far from it.  The turkey was full of flavor and tasted so juicy that I'm pretty sure it was fried sometime during the cooking process.  My gf had the Pasta Da Vinci which was so sweet I thought I was eating candy.  Though sweet, the homemade pasta held its nutty flavor.  I didn't try my sisters chicken parmigiana dish, but she certainly thought it was good.  Pictures for all these dishes are on my blog.  I have decided that when going to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner, never get something healthy because nothing is ever healthy at this restaurant.  The Cheesecake Factory is a comfort food joint, and they are darn good at making that kind of food.  So fess up to the fatness and enjoy!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=940

You would think that Cheesecake factory the home of the cheesecake and would have awesome cheese cake and desserts, right?   When we first got here the wait time was a approximate 40 minute wait. I glanced over to the bar to see if there were any seats open cause if you didn't know you can sit their and eat too.  Minutes pass and I was getting agitated because I really wanted some sweets in my mouth. Bam! the vibrating thing a ma ding rang. we got seated and we ordered the Godiva Chocolate cake and two scoops of vanilla ice cream and the Red Velvet cheese cake.  Man I was thinking  we are in for some yummy treats. Well guess again. My chocolate cake was hard as a rock and the whipping cream was probably just taken out of the freezer cause it didn't move and it was so heavy I wanted to barf.  Neither the two desserts had a standing ovation or an applause. I felt so cheated. We left unhappy and hungry.

We saw her chit chatting with other waiters and never payed any attention to our table. Additionally, I had to ask for some bread which is a first for me since usually it arrives without a request. I guess she forgot since she was too ""busy"" walking around chatting with her co workers. After some time, she came by with another waiter saying that the gentlemen would take over for her. The guy was really nice but he never came by for a drink refill which was very disappointing. Over all, the service at this location is very terrible.

Friday 730pm went in and was told the wait is 40 mins to one hr by two people one of them was the mngr. At 830 checked in to see how much longer and was rudely told 'I told you 1:40mins'. There is a huge difference when you tell someone 40 mins to one hr vs an hour and forty mins. And I'm not that old to need a hearing aid. So asked the manager to check if there were any possibility of it being sooner with less people since two were babies not needing a seat.

I have frequented the marina del Rey location my entire life and have visited other CCFs so I thought this one was a sure thing. I get restaurants get hectic and servers/ hostess' are under all sorts of pressure but the way the hostess & manager spoke to us today was so ridiculous. We were composed and just wanted to understand why after we handed our pager in we had to wait another 40 minutes.  She acted as if we asked her something personally offensive. She obviously forgot about us but instead of speaking to us like an adult she threw a tantrum. This young woman -Jackie-threw up her arms and rolled her eyes as if we were screaming at her. We were finally seated by a super overly nice hostess. I cannot stress enough that we didn't need coddling. We had normal laid back questions met with the worst attitudes. The manager Daniel came to speak to us and was just as bad as Jackie. He didn't care about anything we had to say. Just sucks since now I live near this Cheesecake Factory and I can never visit it as I don't won't to deal with such a wait staff.

Unlimited breads were so addicting (got full before I got my order -_-) I always loved the brown bread, yum. I ordered Chicken Bellagio ($14.50), and it was very delicious. Its portion is huge and the quality is above standard! Crispy chicken breast topped with prosciutto and arugula salad with parmesan cream sauce over basil pasta. It's a big portion that I didn't even finish the pasta ;/ Cousins got two different kind of pasta, and I am not really a fan for their pasta specialties. However the Wild Mushroom burger ($11.95) was delicious. You can taste the sautéed mushroom covered with swiss and fontina cheese, ugh yummy!

The only two things I'll order at this restaurant are the Fried Macaroni Balls and the Renee's Special. I went to this location with my boyfriend for lunch today and of course, I ordered the Fried Mac, the Renee's Special, and my boyfriend ordered the Bacon and Shrimp something Sandwich. We asked the waitress if she's ever had it and she said no. She also told us that a lot of people order it, so we automatically thought it would be good. She ALSO told us it's a pretty big sandwich, so I cancelled my Renee's Special so we could just half the bacon and shrimp thing. HORRIBILE IDEA! Let's review this disgusting sandwich real quick: 1. It's about 3 stories high ... it goes from toast, lettuce, tomato, bacon, toast, more lettuce, then 4-5 small pieces of overcooked, disgusting, ""grilled"" shrimp, in some nasty sauce that should be in a nasty coleslaw.  2. I gave that ugly thing a chance... I ate it. wanted to puke each time.  3. That thing was $13-$14 bucks with BURNT bacon ... and smart&final shrimp... WTF  4. The best thing about that sandwich was the buttery toast, and the tomatoes.  Service was alright. She didn't ask if our meal was ok. The passion iced tea we had tasted like nasty lipstick...and the Manager walked by, mumbled something to us, and before we got the chance to answer, he walked away... Whatevs....Cheesecake Factory will, and always suck.  P.S. why in the world are there a million advertisements in their menus? As if they don't have enough money?  I'd rather spend my money at a taco truck...That sandwich could have bought me a carne asada burrito, 4 tacos, and a quesadilla....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=900

We ordered a pasta dish, Kobe burger and I had the brunch special Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas and Eggs, which was very good!

Last few times we were there, the service was very substandard. The very last time, the server was all over the place, didn't get plates to share, tables were not being cleaned, just an overall mess. The food was not that great either. I remember their chicken littles being so soft and juicy, the last ones were hard and tasted like the ones you would get at a pizza delivery place. Another example is their ranch dressing, it used to be so good, however, the last time it was so salty, we barely touched it.  I hope the management is reading these reviews.

The people across from me seemed to be business people having a lunch meeting.  And the people next to me were obviously tourists who were taking lots of photos of each other.  The waitress was really nice and helpful. She brought my Ice Tea and Crab Cake Appetizer right away, and validated my parking for me.  I was debating about a slice of cheesecake, but I was way to full from my appetizer and meal.

Martha L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,58,428,3.0,10/29/2011,"The wait was only 10 min fir a Saturday afternoon, not bad. We had a margarita with moctezuma tequila while we waited very good. For appetizers we had lettuce wraps which don't come as a mixture like pf changs and other restaurants, you have to build your own. The chicken, carrots, cucumber, etc come individually on a platter and you add whatever u want which is cool I guess. We also had crab cake bites, delicious. For our main entrees I had chicken Romano, my bf had jimbalaya with chicken n shrimp. The Romano was good it is served with spaghetti in a tasty sauce but I always order marinera on the side because I find it a bit dry. The jimbalaya was spicy and tasty.  Overall the food was great, the server...meh. We only saw her when we ordered and when we paid, oh yeah and she refilled my ice water with water only and no ice, it was kind of gross. A fresh cup of water with ice and a new lemon would have been nice. The busser brought us our boxes and removed our plates.  Sometimes it's unfair that a server doesn't do much and takes home all the money and the hard workers just get a cut. In this  case I believe it to be true. I love it when your server is there to take ur order, refill drinks, brings napkins, takes ur plates away, checks on u but isn't overwhelming.  We still left a tip though, we understand there's a lot of people involved in our experience and for them we tipped today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=960

Fred H.,"Burbank, CA",2,90,,2.0,2/17/2016,"I brought my wife to this location on 2/15/16.  There were a few things that we were disappointed about.  The first was that our waitress forgot to return my credit card upon giving us the bill.  This resulted in my having to cancel that credit card and have a new one sent to me.  This server had seemed very tired while serving us and failed to check in on how our dinner was going.  So we had to wait quite a while to get our drinks refilled, more butter for our bread, etc.  The second thing, and this has more to do with the company, is that on their bills, there is a section near the bottom where they ""suggest"" levels of gratuity such as 15%, 18%, and 20%, followed by dollar amounts which are automatically calculated based on the bill's total.  The problem with those ""suggestions"" is that they are based on including drinks and taxes, both of which should not be included when calculating gratuity in the United States.  This means that a lot of less informed people, those who don't calculate their own gratuity, are trusting the miscalculations that are listed on the bills for gratuity, which greatly favor the servers.  It's not ethically right for the restaurant to do this since an uninformed customer would be trusting a miscalculation.  Both of these variables in our experience that night determine that we will not visit this location again.  They need to have alert servers working, and they should not mislead their customers in the way of what is considered normal gratuity percentages.  I only wish that I could have taken back some of the gratuity that I left for the waitress who left my card at her register forcing me to cancel the card.  Oh well, if she does that a few more times, she won't be working there much longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=760

Everything was fine; my dog was behaving fine (with the leash tied to the black fence outside), my mom and I were served our waters & bread, and we were waiting for our server to show up. Then comes a 'manager' that tells us they couldn't serve us because we had our dogs with us and other diners had an issue with this. We were asked to leave the restaurant. SERIOUSLY? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Your 'competent' hostess already knew we had our dog with us, and he was (as indicated), OUTSIDE the dining area.

Nikki C.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",85,58,19,1.0,1/5/2015,"In December 2014, to celebrate the holidays I made reservations for my coworkers and I for a table of 20 for 4:00. The date of the event, on 12/18/14, I receive a call from a staff member/management stating that my reservations will not be honored as I requested because the staff member who took my reservation was ""not authorized"" to do so. (??? How was I suppose to know that and why should their problem become mine?) Instead she insisted that all 20 of us show up by 3:30 or the tables will be given away. This was unreasonable because as teachers having to work with parents and preparing lessons, it is VERY difficult to decide last minute to leave work early, not to mention the obvious: the difficulty of getting 20 teachers to leave early the DAY OF -as this call was made to me 4 hours prior to the event time.... At this point, it was necessary for me to asked to speak to the manager above, on site. Needless to say, I was feeling panicky and thinking, ""I can't believe this happening! CHEESECAKE would do it??! What they are doing is wrong AND will all 20 of my coworkers have a seat?"" So I basically begged the manager to honor the reservation that was taken two weeks prior, FOR 4:00, and that 20 PEOPLE SIGNED UP to attend and are counting on the reservations. I was stern but remained respectful. He was not empathic. I told him I was very disappointed and yet he didn't seem to care. He would not honor the original 4:00 reservation. W-O-W. I will NEVER make reservations again at CHEESECAKE FACTORY.  OUTCOME of the event: After being stress out and scrambling with my committee members, we spread the word to our coworkers and told them the situation and asked them to please arrive at 3:30, if possible.... Fast forward to 3:30: our tables were occupied and were NOT available for us UNTIL 4. (Interesting, I was threatened that we would lose our tables if we were not present by 3:30.) the good news is, we all got chairs so I was relieved at that point and decided for the evening I will enjoy and forget management and deal with the upset later. At the time it was easy to be happy because I had good company, the holidays were approaching and the servers were friendly and prompt.  I was debating to write this review, however the two staff members/managers of Cheesecake treated me wrong and I hope they will not do the same to others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=760

I don't care how good the food is, if the service sucks then I'm not spending my money there. If you're at the Americana GO TO GRANVILLE INSTEAD! DON'T GO TO THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO EAT. We were seated very quickly, and the place was actually pretty empty so I can't explain why the service was so awful. Our waitress was very nice, Victoria, BUT AFTER WAITING OVER 45 MINUTES WE NEVER GOT OUR FOOD, and our very friendly waitress, Victoria, disappeared! I left work early to take my daughter to a fun lunch at the Americana, and opted to go to the cheesecake factory.  My daughter ordered a burger, and I ordered a salad, simple enough.  Well, we got the appetizer fairly quickly; however, after the appetizer came we waited another 40 minutes and the food never came AND our waitress disappeared.  I flagged down a different waitress who then checked on our order, and a few minutes later showed up with the burger which had obviously been sitting under the heat lamps for a while since the cheese was all cold and puckered looking, and the beef was rubbery, um if I'm paying $13.00 for a burger it better be hot and cooked correctly.   After a few more minutes the manager shows up, and tried to make us happy, but by that point my daughter was crying because she was so angry, and she just wanted to leave.  I explained to the manager that I don't have issue waiting for food, but they should have at least checked in with us and let us know that our order was delayed.  A waitress shouldn't just leave the patron waiting...we were there so long someone even came by and packed up our appetizer before the food even came, that alone speaks volumes.

Over 30 parties of 2 to 6 people waiting in line, all frustrated because of wrong information the reception was giving to customers. Telling people the wait is 30 minutes and providing the table in 90 minutes. We were seated at last, witnessing a shocking experience of 2 hungry and thirsty kids crying terrified of the police officers that were denying them service..... For no reason... Imagine that!  The gentleman was not aggressive at all; he was mad at the situation and all he was asking was ""I need to know who's kicking me out, I need his business card""  I overheard the officer say ""this is the only Brian here and we're not obligated to give you his last name...""

Keely G.,"Los Angeles, CA",797,262,55,1.0,5/18/2013,"TSK, TSK Cheesecake Factory!  Before I commence with my scathing review about our lunch yesterday, let me state that I eat here all the time and normally I receive the type of service I've come to expect at a CF: excellent. That being said, yesterday's experience from top to bottom sucked. Big time.  The only positive was being warmly greeted by the hostess Maddy.  As a huge Laker fan, I recognized her right away as one of the Laker Girls. : ) Being that it was a gorgeous day, we asked for a table outside on the patio. Wish granted.  However, the girl who took the four of us to our table, brought us to a party of 10 people and started to put our menus down, which created an awkward moment where we were wondering ""who are these people and why do we have to sit with them?"" while said people were looking at us thinking, ""who are these girls crashing our party?"" So I told the girl, ""Hold on, you know we're not with those people right?"" Clearly flustered, she just sat us at the closest table, dropped the menus and bolted. Well, the table was as close as any table could possibly be to the huge party, & we just wanted a nice, quiet lunch away from parties & kids, so we asked to be moved. Little did we know, we were moving to a new area that would bring us to the worst service imaginable.  1.) Drinks came & I had some foreign object floating in my iced tea. No harm, no foul as it was replaced. 2.) My friend decided she wanted a lemonade, so she ordered one at the time our initial drinks were being delivered (more on that later). 3.) Normally, we request a basket of that delicious honey wheat bread (no white bread) but a mixed basket was plunked down before we had a chance to ask. No worries, less carbs is probably a good thing. 4.) We order two Skinnyliscious Factory Salads, a Skinnyliscious Chicken Salad sandwich and a Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  After what seemed like an eternity, our food shows up. But, not all the food, only the TWO salads. One of the salads had a hair in it, but my friend wasn't sure if it was hers (her hair was in a ponytail) or not. She convinced herself it was hers (EEK). Surely, the other two dishes are right behind it, right?  Wrong.  It was about 10-15 minutes before the Grilled Chicken sandwich showed up, leaving one person at our table with no food. And not wanting to be rude, we all just sat there & waited & waited & waited for the Chicken Salad sandwich to show up.  It was around this time, that my friend's lemonade showed up (30 minutes later!)  Our waitress never came by during this entire debacle until my laser beam glare caught her from across the patio and I motioned her over.  When informed that we were missing a dish & that we had been waiting a really long time for it, she went to check it out & came back with just the side salad in a small bowl and plunked it down. Honestly, it looked like mixed greens and dressing that would have taken 15 seconds to make. Well, finally, we can all get started eating... but by that time we were pretty much fed up.  We flagged down some random girl & asked for the manager. Clearly, she goes and tells our server of our request for a manager instead of sending him directly over because after 10-15 more minutes the joke of a sandwich shows up, delivered by our waitress. Huge white plate, with a mid-sized sandwich sitting in the middle--not even a garnish. No joke, it was two slices of toasted white bread with premade chicken salad, lettuce and a tomato. THAT IS WHAT WE WAITED 40+ MINUTES FOR??!!!  I've made sandwiches at home that looked better than that!  And mind you, it wasn't even crowded in the restaurant. Instead of apologizing, she asks ""Do you still want to speak to the manager?""  Are you crazy lady? Of course we do! Even more so now. 5.) The ""Manager"" - Oh boy. I think his name was Julian or Justin and I'm still not convinced that he was even a manager given his demeanor dealing with us. It was evident that our waitress had given him her (very skewed) version of events prior to his arrival because he comes over and very nonchalantly says, ""So, I hear there was a dish that took a little longer to arrive.""  Really, dude?  Honestly, I think he apologized but I'm not entirely sure as he spoke very fast and mumbly, which came off as totally insincere. He offered to give us a complimentary dessert, which we declined being that 3 of the 4 of us ordered from the SKINNYliscious menu (Hellooo, summer is upon us!).  I think that threw him for a loop and he looked unsure what to do at that point. Finally, he offered to comp the meal that took ages to arrive and he left. In summary, a nice quick bite to eat for lunch turned into an irritating, unsatisfying nearly 2 hour experience. Shame on you Cheesecake Factory, I really expect so much more from you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=740

I ordered the orange chicken which I haven't had in years.  The last time I had it was probably 7 years ago and I didn't like it, but I decided to try it again out of curiosity, to see what it was I didn't like about it back then.  Oddly enough, I enjoyed it.  It had a slight taste of orange to it, stronger than what you'd find at Panda Express.  The chicken was tender and the batter was not too tough or hard.  They give you a good amount of rice which I wasn't able to finish.  We also ordered my favorite dessert there, or at least it used to be.  I haven't had it in awhile either since I don't come here often, but I had it pretty hyped up in my head.  Strawberry Shortcake.  Vanilla ice cream, a biscuit, strawberries, strawberry glaze, and way too much whipped cream.  I think it met my expectations.  It was good.  I had to move the whipped cream aside, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=920

Moving forward.  J & C get there first, and are told the wait will be 1 - 1.5hrs.  Okay, that's fine.  We're just pulling in to the jam-packed parking lot, and it'll take us maybe 20 minutes to find parking anyway.  Fast forward after taking some strolls, a little window shopping, and a quick nibble on something, the boys check in on our wait.  Well, despite the fact that we've been waiting an hour and fifteen minutes, the boys come back and tell us that we'll be waiting another hour and a half.  Wait, wahhhhhhh?  2.5 hours?  For D's mom to order chicken alfredo?  No.  Not happening. Well, we didn't end up waiting that dreaded extra hour and a half.  We were sat outside and repeatedly asked to have the heater turned on, the staff just kept on saying he would until finally we overheard him ask someone else how to do it because HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW.  Why wouldn't you just say so?  Well, bottom line, we'll never return on a holiday.  D's mom just REALLY had to try it here, and hopefully we shall never return for such a dull experience.

Came here during New Years day for dinner, and found out that this place was packed! Guess everyone else also thought starting their year with some cheesecake won't be a bad idea ;) There was a line to put your name down with the hostess, but luckily the bar and the high top area is self seating. I was lucky enough to be able to find an empty high top table and got seated right away. ALWAYS ALWAYS CHECK!  We ordered a Steak Medallion and a Pasta Napoletana off of their special menu, items on those menu in our opinion are more worth it than the other dishes on the regular menu.  Both dishes were very filly and yummy, we enjoyed both dishes very much and I still have pasta leftovers even after stuffing my face. However, as with all other dishes from Cheesecake Factory, don't expect it to be healthy since it's cooked with lots of oil/butter/flavorings.  Overall good experience, I like that the Americana CF location is in such a prime spot because Americana is the perfect date location (esp with all the festival lights).

Karl K.,"Los Angeles, CA",292,374,3668,3.0,12/17/2017,"Come for dinner at 4pm, skip the seafood chicken jambalaya, get the chicken piccata  ------------------- This basically sums up our recent experience here. The line at 4 PM on Saturday (admittedly, the weekend before Christmas) was tolerable at 40 minutes. If you come after that then you are screwed and be prepared to wait for upwards of 90 minutes or more. Anyway our party of four adults one kid and one toddler was seated in a seemingly large booth. However the seats felt like an airplane seating - meaning if one of us had to exit to the aisle it required a major reshuffling of people sitting in the same row. Probably because of the toddler highchair but still this felt really tight even without the highchair. The only dish worth mentioning today was the lemon chicken piccata that wifey got. It had the perfect balance of tender chicken breast, citrus zest, and just the right amount of cream without being overbearing. Meanwhile the seafood chicken jambalaya pasta was a complete hot mess and should be burned alive LOL! I mean seriously why put Jambolaya with pasta and furthermore the Jambolaya had no southern seasoning nor spice. Pass! Thank God they did not screw up the cheesecake - both the key lime cheesecake and the strawberry cheesecake were excellent - as they should be from a restaurant who's name sake is cheesecakes LOL.

Serli N.,"Glendale, CA",138,126,279,3.0,1/3/2018,"More like 3.5 stars for me... I feel like CF is a jack of all trades. They have an extremely large menu so there's something for everyone, but with this variety you compromise some quality. The food is consistent and good MOST of the time, but other times the quality hasn't been great, the wait does tend to be long, and it gets very loud indoors when it's busy. It's hard to give one rating when I've been here more times than I can remember with varying experiences but the Americana location is by far the closest and my most frequented location. I've had many items from their menu over the years...from appetizers: avocado egg rolls (delicious), fried mac and cheese (pretty good), tex mex eggrolls (just okay), sweet corn tamale cakes (amazing but so many calories!)... from entrees: Louisiana pasta chicken (good but heavy), pasta da vinci (decent as well), veggie burger (amazing surprisingly), Mexican tortilla salad (hit or miss but usually good)... brunch/breakfast: monte Cristo is my sister's favorite. Probably a few more I'm forgetting at the moment. The wait times can get long on the weekends. When majority of restaurants now use the texting system, I don't like how they give you a buzzer at this location so you can't walk around too far while you wait. They do validate for Americana parking. Service has always been good. Regardless of the average rating, CF is like a staple that I'll be returning to due to its a popular choice among friends and it having something for everyone.

We waited for around 5 mins, and was promptly seated. Our server Omar was very attentive and catered to one of our party food allergies very well. I ordered the beautiful Bruleed French Toast with bacon! Oh man this was a gorgeously tasty dish, especially after being drenched in maple syrup. To top it all off, I got myself a Bloody Mary!

Had a late lunch with my family and a few hours later I felt extremely nauseous. End be all, I ended up in the hospital for food poisoning and have never felt so terrible in my life. I had one of their new Orlean style pastas and I'm not sure if it was the chicken or perhaps the sauce. Let's just say I am scarred from ever eating here.. and don't want to think about chicken or pasta.  Such a terrible experience. I never thought cheesecake to be a 5 Star, but it was always convenient. Convenience is not worth anyone's well being.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Cheesecake Factory has so many options that you will find something of your liking. Those who like to watch the calories they have a ""skinnylicious"" menu.  All plates are huge; you can share!!  For those not worried about calories my favorites off the menu are: The jambalaya pasta with chicken and shrimp. A bit spicy with some Cajun seasoning all over the pasta, grilled bell peppers and poultry and shrimp.  Avocado egg rolls! A fun, fried, oily appetizer that everyone just loves.  Ahi carpaccio. A plate filled with an extremely thin layer of ahi, with some ginger and sesame sauce. It's not heavy and you won't feel guilty.  Recently however, I ordered the herb crusted salmon along with a dark greens mix salad (no dressing; lemon wedges on side) and was appalled when 90% of the salad was old. I mean, it smelled old from the second they sat it down.  We ordered two of these, both the same. So, it wasn't just bad luck either.  The manager apologized and told us he would send a new plate however we argued it would be the same as their salad bunch had likely gone bad. He assured us there was fresh salad in the back. (Well, good sir, why did your kitchen staff not make sure that's what they plate?) they ended up giving us free cheesecake and comping my meal.

For those who are trying to watch the calories, you can choose from their skinnylicious menu (but you trade off a lot of the flavor and.. yes carbs). The hardest thing about The Cheesecake Factory is it has 100000 things on the menu. It is so hard to choose sometimes. My favorite menu items are the chicken and shrimp gumbo, factory burger, jambalaya with pasta, and chicken romano.  We usually get an order of the calamari and avocado egg rolls to start.

And for the most part there is no in between. My girlfriend and I are both not big on the Cheesecake Factory. We said since we've never had it together that we should try it.  After our meal there we are sticking to our no Cheesecake Factory rule.  This location is pretty cool and big. They have a lot of patrons that frequent here. The staff seemed to be on it and they seated us rather quickly even with them being busy. As you know they have a huge menu. Which can be kind of a down side because that leaves no room for pictures and too many different dishes for the chefs to make. But it is what it is.  I orders the truffle honey chicken which sounded amazing but it was blah. It reminded you chicken fried steak with a honey glaze. The coating on the chicken was overly sweet and falling off. So I had to scoop the mash, chicken n the coating to the effect. The mash potatoes were the savior of that dish.  My girlfriend ordered some other chicken dish which was not to bad but heavy on the lemon sauce. That was was ok. We also had the sweet corn tamale cakes. Those are so good. They like made up for the blah meals.  All in all I'm not gonna trash the restaurant because they have a good clientele and rep but it's not for me. Like I said this chain is a hit and miss.

Greg P.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",0,22,40,3.0,12/27/2017,"The food is alright and the service is very hit or miss. I've been coming here for years because it's an easy place to eat at the Americana with friends/family, since they have every type of food on the menu imaginable.  At my last visit, our server was great. Her name was Kelly B and she was very sweet, attentive, and overall one of the better servers that I have had while eating at this location.  Of all the things I have eaten at Cheesecake, I will say one item on the menu sticks out to me and I get it almost every time. That is the dressing on the Santa Fe Salad (it is a Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette). It is very delicious and I typically ask for that dressing on almost any salad I order. Definitely recommend that dressing.  One of the biggest problems I have had at Cheesecake Factory is when I adjust the specifications of a dish, it typically comes out wrong. I have no idea why? I find it hard to believe it's the servers putting in the wrong order every time (that would be just too coincidental). I like to think it's miscommunication either in the kitchen or with the expo/food runners. Whatever it is, I always expect my order to come out wrong if I change it up from what the menu has, so I pretty much try my best to either keep it very simple or just find an entree that doesn't need any adjustments. For example, I gave up on ordering a burger with the exact ingredients that I like. It's like the chef's take a look at my burger order and say ""well, that's cute, but I think he'll like this instead."" Nah... I just want my burger the way I asked please.  Overall, the Cheesecake Factory can be a very hit or miss place with both food and service. The upside to the restaurant is that the menu is gigantic, so it's perfect for a group of people who want different foods. It's a nearly impossible feat to find somebody that wouldn't like anything on the menu. I will probably always be dragged back here by friends/family just because the convenience of the large menu, but in reality, the Americana has so many better restaurants (in my opinion).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2

We are there waiting another 30 mins and see that they keep passing other parties to get seated after us. We are waiting and waiting and I went up to the rude host and told her that it's very wrong to have us waiting while others are eating seated after us.

Miranda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,5.0,2/26/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, and this location is no exception. It gets REALLY busy on the weekends, which can be kind of stressful and loud, but if you can get a table outside, it's a great place to eat, drink, and talk. You can't go wrong with the menu of drinks or food. It's packed with delicious comfort food and has a wide variety of options, depending on what type of food you feel like, and whether you're feeling healthy or not. ;) I ate here last night and there was some kind of mix-up with the food that the people next to us had ordered. The manager came out and spoke with them, and it was handled very professionally. The service is always great. I have been nothing but impressed with the wait staff. The only thing to be careful with when eating at TCF is that the food is so good it's hard to stop. The portions are really big and delicious. Also, with this location in particular, it's located in a really nicely designed mall (The Americana), so it's fun to walk around and shop either before or after eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=300

Daisy S.,"El Segundo, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/10/2016,"Sunday October 2, 2016 at 2pm my family and I (a party of 8 consisting of 4 adults and 4 children) arrived at the Cheesecake Factory for my early birthday lunch, 2:04pm we were put on the waiting list with an approximate seating time of 30 minutes. It was a beautiful sunny evening so naturally we waited outside to enjoy it. Surprisingly, by 2:18pm we received a call letting us know our table was ready. We rushed back, we were seated within 15 minutes.  Our server Nikki L was extremely pleasant and attentive. We ordered appetizers as soon as we sat down. Shortly after we ordered our Entrees. We were enjoying ourselves too much to notice any prolonged delays in food arrival, so I will say it was a moderate wait. Again, Nikki L came by checking on us numerous times being extremely attentive. Food was great, no complaints even from our most finicky eaters: the kids. Soon after finishing our food Nikki L graciously offered dessert we were so full of yummy food we almost declined, but who goes to the Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake? Simply Unheard of. Sometime after placing the order for dessert Nikki L and 2 of her best voiced coworkers came out to sing the awaited birthday song. While working on dessert a man approached our table telling us to leave table, using offensive language. It is hard to describe the disbelief we were in after this, in total shock. We were frightened. The kids were nervous and confused. We asked for the check immediately after this. Nikki L picked up on the mood change at our table and proceeded to ask why. I described the incident, she immediately apologized. Grateful she did this, however she has no control on what goes on at the front desk. She went on to let her manager know.  Within a few minutes the Manager Bentley came over and sat next to me asking me to describe the incident. So I did just that; her facial expressions changed as I described what happened going from empathetic to ""Oh I know exactly who you are talking about, man in a white collared shirt low haircut. Yes, he did tell me he was going to come over here and tell you guys to leave as he also has a big party and is desperate to be seated we laughed about it ,but I am not going to seat him here anyway I am going to seat him there"" as she pointed to the tables behind us. I was not sure if I had understood correctly so I asked her directly, ""You knew this aggravated man was going to come to our table, and you didn't let him know that was unacceptable?"" to which she replied without hesitation ""Yes but it could have been a joke"" to which I responded with a simple ""Thank you"" She continued with apologies but again I said ""thank you"". I was in utter disbelief that she knew beforehand and took it so lightly. Nikki L came by again bringing the copies of the receipts. She asked if the manager had come by and I said yes, went on to let her know Bentley already knew so it only made me feel worse. She was so upset on the manager's reaction to the event she insisted on letting the general manager know. Rick stopped by gave his apologies for the 2 incidents and assured me this is not a reflection on The Cheesecake Factory.  We are ready to go and move on with our day, as we are walking out the man in the white shirt is at the door and immediately begins to yell out offensive words and approaches the only male adult in our group calling him out to engage in a physical altercation. This causes havoc. Thankfully we were able to walk out without being physically hurt.  As I reflect on this I think perhaps if the Bentley would have taken a more serious approach and had not made a joke out of letting an aggravated impatient man approach our table. Why joke about something so invasive and downright rude. Is there a Policy in place for situations like this? Was this a racial issue? Why did she not care? *****I sent corporate office a message the day after the fact a whole week went by and no response.*****",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=300

It was pretty busy since it was before a holiday weekend. The wait wasn't too bad since it's in the Americana plaza with lots of shopping stores, the Apple Store, the movie theater, and dessert places such as Sprinkles.  We got seated in a booth and it was dimly lit inside. The music was loud but we didn't mind. Service was prompt and the food was delicious. We ordered the Steak Diane and buffalo wings with ranch dressing. We tried to make room for a cheesecake but still ended up being too full. I think we ate too much of their bread and butter. It was too good to pass.  So far, I've been quite pleased with lunch and dinner meals at Cheesecake Factory.

We also didn't receive any of the brown wheat bread, the best bread, while every other table had some. We ate rock hard/stale white bread. Waited almost 35 minutes for our food to come out.

I've been here many times and the service is always good, and the food is always really good. This place blows away the one in Pasadena.

F.,"Melrose, Los Angeles, CA",260,251,1284,4.0,3/10/2016,"This place continues to be a sure thing any time of day.  I mean the menu is so extensive there's everything from burgers and salads to pizza and pasta to steaks and ahi tuna the list goes on and on. Throughout the years there hasn't been anything I've ordered that I didn't like.  Heck, even the kids fried macaroni balls are good.   If you can avoid not filling up from the warm table bread that will be the first obstacle.  Good luck. It's fresh baked, soft centered yumminess.  I'm salivating already.  My personal favorites are  1. Chicken Madeira- it's a specialty, hearty meal with savory chicken breasts and bomb ass mashed potatoes, asparagus and mozza.  Yes I said it! Bomb! (drops mic)  2. Chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta- this is super delicious, enough for two people. All time favorite pasta dish that never gets old.  3. Avocado egg rolls- I can have this as a meal in itself. The tamarind cashew dipping sauce is what makes this super amazing. 4. Cheesecakes- the white chocolate raspberry truffle is to die for.  This goes well with extra whipped cream.  The fresh strawberry cheesecake with real strawberries and glaze is an all time classic.   The key lime cheesecake gives a cool sweet and tart finish. Great palate refresher.  The marshmallow Smores galore is one my kids enjoy.  Gooey and chocolatey madness with graham crackers.  No fast food prices here. Nice, consistent establishment that has survived the test of time.

I guess my only complaint would be the small table we were sat at because I felt like I couldn't talk without the table next to me hearing every word.

Tehmine P.,"Glendale, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/12/2017,"We where there last night with a group of 10. I ordered the chicken mango salad and specifically asked for it to be dry, no dressing. When I got my salad it look like it had dressing, so I told the waiter (Christopher S )  'it seems like my salad has a dressing' he said he's 'pretty sure it doesn't but he'll check with the kitchen to make sure it's completely dry' He came back and lied saying 'yes it is dry'. I ate 1/5 of the salad when I actually saw the dressing in my salad.  When I brought this to the waiter's attention he just said 'oh I'm sorry about that'. He offered nothing more.   We just paid  for our dinner and left. However, because of the dressing I have been sick since last night. When I asked for no dressing it wasn't because I didn't like the taste of it or I wasn't trying to be a difficult customer   but I was trying to avoid getting sick. I can understand that there can be mistakes but for the waiter to outright lie it's unacceptable. I specifically asked him after I got my salad and he looked right into my eyes and told me it had no dressing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=100
Michael L.,"Los Angeles, CA",371,26,1,5.0,2/23/2017,"There I found myself: adrift among a sea of tables adorned with ravenous families clad in their Tommy Bahama regalia, battered in sunscreen, flush and eager for the next round of platters like timorous expectant fathers in the hospital waiting room. These fine people had been fully depleted by the long and arduous day of parading around the Glendale Americana like prize ponies at the county fair and they deserved a hero's welcome and a hero's feast. As the servants scurried out of their holes, their arms weak under the massive silver platters and their bodies starved and shaking from their Cheesecake Factory-prescribed daily meal of brine and amphetamine, they made their way to the tables to unleash the cornucopia. The servants presented their vessels in solemn reverence and with eyes cast down for fear of incurring the wrath of their noble guests. The floor vibrated from the sheer turbulence of the collective feeding and could surely have been felt in all the far reaches of the Americana. Chairs buckled, tables creaked and clothing was torn asunder as the orgy of consumption came to a boil. Chunks of indiscernible organic matter burst forth in all directions like a food grenade, splattering the faces of the servants as they stood like cemetery gargoyles, guarding the frenzy, hiding their tears, and biding their time. The eye of the storm came to the Cheesecake Factory like a morphine drip to a recent amputee. The nobles inevitably hit their critical mass and had to pause to digest and let their pre-installed insulin pumps do their job. In this blessed peaceful intermission, the servants cleaned in silence. I used this brief moment of relative serenity to make my exit, for I dared not witness the second wave of offerings. I turned to look back upon the Factory and gave them a tearful salute. They are doing God's work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=100

I ordered the Parmesan Garlic bread and the Asian potstickers. I really don't know what happened - just everything seemed so mediocre and half-heartedly prepared (as well as served). Perhaps it was my fault for ordering potstickers from this establishment, but I didn't think it was possible for them to be as awful as they were; the filling, chicken, was very dry, and the sauce seemed desperate to overcompensate for the other flaws in the dish, and honestly, even that was just all over the place, trying way too hard, and failing just as hard, if not harder.  The garlic bread, which I usually love so much, was mostly burnt at the ends, with just lazy presentation. Now most of the time the food is pretty epic, so I believe (and fervently hope) that this was just one bad night. I'll let it slide this *one* time, Cheesecake.

Our server Gordan, was so very attentive.  I'm not the easiest person to get an order from.  I wanted something fruity and chose a vodka infused lemonade.  My bf wanted a peach smoothie.  Both drinks were great.  The peach smoothie had some raspberry in it and some fresh fruit garnish.  My vodka lemonade came in a sugar rimmed glass and was crisp and refreshing.   I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and my bf ordered the Smokehouse BBQ Burger medium rare.  Our food came quickly and we were so satisfied!  Mine was 3 pounded chicken breasts with a delicious lemon sauce, a generous portion of smashed red potatoes, and crisp asparagus.  It was so good!   My bf is pretty picky about his burger being cooked medium rare and his burger was perfect!  It came piled high with onion rings and fries.  It looked more like an art project and he loved it.   We decided to have coffee and split a slice of Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake.  We both like coconut and this dessert has a layer of chocolate cake, a layer of brownie, coconut-pecan frosting and chocolate chip coconut cheesecake.  It' was the bomb!  Super rich and flavorful, we dug in!   My bf got a phone call from a client and we had to split.  We asked Gordan for some to go cups for the coffee and a box for the rest of the cheesecake.  Now, I figured he would bring empty cups so we could pour our coffee into it.  No!  He brought us 2 fresh coffees in to go cups!  I thought that was really nice and considerate of him!  He didn't have to do that.   I have to say the wait staff at this restaurant was exceptional.  This is a HUGE place with tons of tables and we were there on a Saturday evening so it was packed!  Despite that, our waiter was very patient with us and that was so refreshing.  He really cared about us and was very intuitive as to what we needed.  The table next to us had a different waiter and I made eye contact with her while she was talking to her table.  After she finished at her table, she came by and asked if I needed anything.  I didn't, but what if I did?  I liked that she was attentive and willing to help another table  that wasn't hers.  So many times it's like, pfft...not my table.  But not here. I would definitely come here again.  The food and the service was fantastic!   (I don't get the negative reviews about the food.  Especially that lady complaining about the calories and the fat content.  So don't eat here.  It's not that hard of a concept.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=600

It's a slightly breaded thin breast of chicken with a little cheese to its crust. The pasta is in a standard tomato sauce. It's my go to dish here. I also like the road side sliders. Perfect little burgers of ground beef & onions served on dinner rolls. Already comes with ketchup. Genius! Hold the pickles, yo! The pizzas are good, the salads are monsters.... The most popular dishes are probably the jambalaya and chicken madeira. The bread is good, the butter is delish... The pulled pork sammich... was surprisingly disappointing. The chunks were too big. Couldn't eat it in that sandwich. It needed to be shredded or actually pulled apart more.  I had the fish & chips before and I really liked it. I found myself craving it last Friday night. And being Lent, it was perfect for a take home dinner. Called it in, avoided the madness that is the Cheesecake Factory waiting area and took it home. It was crispy, delicious, the batter was perfect. It comes with coleslaw, tartar sauce for dipping & french fries. A good serving of coleslaw, I might add. The only thing I would add is an extra container of tartar sauce. I'll ask for that next time. Good meal, nonetheless.

There was an hour and a half wait for our group...the good news is this place is located in the Americana in Glendale so there's plenty of things to do/see while you wait for your table. You can go on ahead and get a drink from the bar or take pictures in front of the fountain or roam around the three-story Barnes. Cheesecake Factory actually takes your phone number and TEXTS you when your table is ready so that's really convenient!  It's really dim inside so it was kind of hard to read the tiny print on the menu or take any good pictures without flash. Well our group of 11 ordered an array of dishes...here's what we got: - Avocado Egg Rolls (Appetizer: Avocado, tomato, and cilantro wrapped in a crispy wonton wrapper) - Tex Mex Egg Rolls (Appetizer: Chicken, corn, peppers, black beans, onions, and cheese wrapped in crispy wonton wrapper) - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (Chicken, asparagus, peas, peppers, garlice and onion with penne pasta tossed in Chipotle cream sauce topped with tortilla crisps) - Hibachi Steak (Angus hanger steak with mushrooms and onions and bean sprouts served with mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus) - Chicken Bellagio (Crispy chicken on basil pasta and topped with prosciutto and arugula)  - Spicy Cashew Chicken (Mandarin-style chicken served with cashews over white rice) The egg rolls were superb! The outer skin was flaky and crispy and delicious while the inside was HOT and creamy and so full of flavor. They are both served with dipping sauces which complement the egg rolls very well. All the entrees, however, were disappointing. Everything was too salty! The cashew chicken and hibachi steak, especially.  My favorite item was the spicy chicken chipotle pasta!  Most items here range in price from $12.95 to $18.95. MOST items. I really liked that they had a ""Skinnylicious"" menu as well for those watching their caloric intake!  Service here was great!

First of all she was taking our plates to the wrong table and then she just basically threw our plates at us after we told her those plates were ours. She then started to walk away and the stupid Mexican(me) asked her if she could get us some bread, she turned around surprised as if I had insulted her, she asked if I wanted both kinds of bread and immediately her tone made me feel that I was wrong by asking a white waiter to give me more bread. That moment I knew that white people serving food are there to serve only other white people. I just wished I had gone to another restaurant and not to the one where most people are white. But come on when there is a white person in a Mexican restaurant they expect us to treat them like tourists going to Baja, I'm surprised they don't try to bargain their bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=580

Don G.,"Quartz Hill, CA",275,338,49,2.0,10/27/2014,Service is not friendly at all. We started at the bar area while we we're waiting for our food and the waiter that was helping us was rude when he found out we we're waiting for a table. It's understandable that whatever we order there that we would need to close out the check first before moving to the main dining. But to make me wait almost 10 mins to get my check since he hopped from one table to another was unacceptable.  So then we moved to the main dining and it seems even our new waiter has some attitude and seemed snobby/irritated. But he was attentive and refilled drinks. Maybe he was just having an off day. Here's my feedback on the food: calamari - even though it was cooked right. way too much breading and too salty. corn tortilla soup - was amazing pepperoni pizza - crust was great but it was too salty chicken alfredo - pasta was al dente and it tasted great.

We were told that the table would be ready within 40-50 mins (which I understand is only an estimate & inaccurate), ignoring the fact that the two ladies who we spoke to were immensely rude.

Besides they had forgotten my friend's order and when they brought it, it was actually NOT the right food she had ordered!  2) came with the same friends months later, and they were experiencing some issues with their oven. Since we were going to order salad only we decided to still go in, specially that there was no wait time. So after waiting for 20 min i went to the register and reminded them that we were waiting for them to come take the order. Even though they said they are going to take our order NOW, we waited for ANOTHER 10 min and then left UNSATISFIED.  3) came here for a date and the waitress that was assigned to us had some sort of attitude. She did not smile or greed us at all! She then came to us to report that our order was going to take 20 min to be ready, because ""they were making it from scratch"" i mean c'mon!

Marianne A.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,58,,5.0,1/5/2016,"My first review was two stars because of the outside seating atmosphere - kids running around uncontrolled and throwing toys on the ground. This review is five stars because we ate lunch in the bar area late one afternoon and it was a completely different and really nice experience - because the bartender Katherine E and the guy bartender (whose name I didn't get) were friendly and fast and took great care of us. Saturday afternoon about 5pm after a movie and the line of customers waiting to check in with the hostess was lined up to the doors. When we got to the front we found that the wait was over an hour for two of us and would've been way longer for more people. Open seating is first come first served in the bar area but nothing was open. They were out of pagers so we were given a paper ticket to come back at a certain time.  We walked around the Americana for about thirty minutes and then wandered back to take another look at the bar area to see if anything had opened up in there. There were two stools at the very end of the bar top with a flat panel tv overhead and a good amount of space there, not crammed together. I have no clue why they were empty and why there was nobody else standing there waiting to snag anything that opened up. Lucky for us that we were only two and were glad to sit there.  When I went to take our name off of the list it was total chaos around the host/hostess stand -with the people with tickets trying to get to the stand to claim their arrival time right next to the people just arriving and trying to put their name on the list. I heard them saying to those just arriving that the wait was an hour and a half.  For our experience this time, it would've been worth an hour and a half wait. Katherine was the bartender who greeted us and laid out two clean white napkins like a tablecloth on the bar top when she found out we were going to be eating there with them. She and the other bartender were so welcoming and super nice to us even though they were slammed and taking care of drink orders for (I guess) the whole restaurant as well as for people in the bar - and punching in the food and making drinks and getting refills for those of us eating. The food runner guy was also really nice. Even though they were so busy, all of them seemed to really care about making it as good of an experience as possible for us and the rest of the customers - and I think most of us at the bar that afternoon were eating food, not just getting snacks or drinks.  To add to a really great experience, the food we ordered came out absolutely perfect - especially/even the burger - which can be hit or miss almost anywhere when you request it to be grilled medium and especially if the kitchen is jamming. The bread and butter basket was given to us just as if we had been at a table or booth. Factory Burger on wheat loaf with swiss cheese, sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo on the side, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - then we had two complimentary slices of cheesecake from gift cards so we got a slice of Godiva chocolate cheesecake and a slice of key lime cheesecake and took some of it home.  We live about thirty miles from here- this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to us - for whatever it's worth, we will totally come back here and try to get a spot at the bar top again !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=620

Some I wasn't a fan of, most are okay, few are great. My absolute favvvvvv is the Louisiana chicken pasta, it's a little on the spicy side and I like how the chicken is breaded. The avocado egg rolls are the best from anywhere else I have tried. I was not a fan of the orange chicken. Oh and the drinks :) yummmm! Pretty much all the drinks are good, but if you like rum you MUST get a mojito (any of them are amazing). In the end the cheesecake factory isn't the best but it's not bad either.

And sure enough, it could barely hold our food on the table, and my elbows were banging into the wall by me. The food and service, though, are GREAT. I believe our server's name was Omar? He was really kind: went through all the specials, soups, etc.; and came to check on us often enough that we didn't have to wait around to order or ask questions, but not too often that he was breathing down our necks. For starters, the bread is amazing. And the butter. YUM. We ordered the appetizer Avocado Eggrolls and the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. They were both delicious! The eggrolls had a perfect crunchy outer shell with a contrasting soft and ripe avocado filling. This dish is like a classy level up from the regular eggrolls. And the sauce/dressing/whatever was delicious too. It brought a sweet tanginess to the slightly insipid flavor of the eggroll itself. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta was sooo good. It's not like the other pastas that make you feel like barfing after a few bites because the sauce is too creamy or bland.

I LOVE where this one is located, right in the middle of the Americana. We were seated outside with an awesome view during dinner. The fountain show was happening with music and the lights everywhere just made everything look so much more beautiful here. I had my pomeranian with me so one of the servers outside went out of her way and got us seated near her in the outside patio section because she thought she was such a cutie(she is and she knows it too, which is why she usually gets her way lol). We were seated right next to a heat lamp so we had a warm dinner.  FOOD: Pasta da Vinci: sautéed chicken, mushrooms and onions in a madeira wine sauce in penne pasta..my favorite pasta to get here! It was a little undercooked this time and can sometimes the wine sauce feels a bit heavy and greasy but this time it was made just right! A must try! :) Crispy Crab Bites: Bite sized mini crab cakes that come with a mustard-tartar sauce, it was crispy and real crab inside, so good but only 5 small pieces since it is part of their ""small plates"" menu :( Chicken Madeira: their most popular chicken dish and always recommended by all servers..for a good reason! Its sautéed Chicken Breast topped with asparagus and mozzarella cheese, covered with mushroom madeira sauce and a side of mashed potatoes. You get a HUGE portion so its plenty to share or take home and the chicken is not dry, the mushroom sauce is delish and so are the mashed potatos!  We didn't have room for dessert but I love their Banana Cream Cheesecake :)   Total tab was about $50 something before tip. It was a good experience, and my first time eating outside on the patio.

lolita b.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,11,,1.0,5/16/2015,"Today at approximately 1pm, I had the worst service experience at Cheesecake Factory ever. I sat at the bar and upon taking my order the bartender immediately noticed how dirty my side plate was and switched it out ASAP. This impressed me because I'm a slight germaphobe and I didn't have to point it out to him. Now this is where he goes wrong... I ordered a glass of wine and the glass that it was served in was dirty. I asked the very same bartender for a clean glass and he looks at the glass and ask if it stinks or is it dirty. I stated that it's very dirty. He tell me it's just hard water. Seriously?! If you're aware that your dishes come out looking dirty after they're cleaned, maybe you should take an extra step in ensuring that customers do not get ""dirty"" glasses. At this point the exchange became mildly patronizing on his part. My meal arrived and not once was I checked on by either bartender. I shared my story w/the woman who sat beside me. She told me to let the poor service reflect in my tip. I couldn't do that, I reluctantly left 18%. As I was leaving I said to woman beside me, ""watch...they're not going to say goodbye, thank you or offer me a parking validation."" Sure enough, got I got it right.

My buzzer rang, seat me!  Eventually got seated. My waitress asked us what drink we wanted and...well...disappeared. Didn't hear from her for another fifteen minutes. Finally got our drinks and bread, and we chowed down  faster than you can say carbohydrates. Didn't come by for another fifteen, but we were in such bread heaven and gossip central that we didn't mind.  I got the lunch portion Caesar salad, which was better than usual! It was actually pretty delicious, and I would definitely go back for just that!  I also got the lunch pasta Da Vinci, with fried eggplant. Couldn't even finish it, there was NO fried eggplants, just an overall weird sauce.  Friend got the turkey club and loved it. Other friend got the kale salad (which she said was awesome) and chicken bellagio, and was satisfied.  Overall, it was ok. Waitress was just a bit unorganized, but whatever.

We actually had to go get the manager, and he went back and got our food for us because our server was off doing god knows what.

Yeah It's that good. The fried calamari are so good and so are the Thai lettuce wraps and the firecracker salmon. Usually for a main course I like to order the grilled salmon special with broccoli and asparagus. It's the perfect meal, nice and light and not to mention this dish doesn't have tons of calories like so many other dishes on the menu. The Baja chicken tacos are really good too. Chicken madeira and their pasta dishes are also recommended. I've even tried this place for breakfast and was surprised to find out they have good omelets.

Chris T.,"Riverside, CA",65,124,360,5.0,12/17/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory started a Happy Hour! And what a great deal their Happy Hour is. Select drinks and select appetizers for $5 each from 3-6pm at the bar. I`m sure we all know that The Cheesecake Factory`s prices can be kind of steep, so to order something for $5 with a generous portion is right up my alley. Originally, the boyfriend and I wanted to order from the full menu, but when he saw that they had a happy hour, we ended up walking towards the bar and sat in they`re high tables. It was literally a minute past 6:00, but the waiter was so nice to let us order from the Happy Hour menu if we decided quickly. I got a Cosmopolitan to drink while my boyfriend stuck to water (he`s not much of a drinker). He ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Sliders, Buffalo Blasts, and the Factory Nachos from their Happy Hour menu. I still wanted to order something from the full menu because I was craving their Chicken Bellagio, which I ordered. I got my Cosmo and it was yummy. I wanted to get another drink, however, the Happy Hour was over and the Cosmo was really strong. I don`t think I would`ve been able to handle another one. All the appetizers came out at once and my boyfriend underestimated how much it was going to be. I told him that they`re full-sized appetizers and that he had it coming. I pointed to all the food and told him ""this is all you, honey."" The Southern Fried Chicken Sliders I liked a lot. They use the Chicken Littles from their entree menu and put them in between two buns with shredded lettuce, tomato, and onions with a side of mustard and pickles. I`ve had the Buffalo Blasts before, and I didn`t really like them, but my boyfriend enjoyed them very much. He loves buffalo wings, so this appetizer was totally made for him. The Factory Nachos were huge, but there wasn`t really anything special to them. Chips, melted shredded cheese, jalepenos, sour cream, and guacamole. When my Chicken Bellagio came out, I was really excited. The last time I was at a Cheesecake Factory, my cousin had ordered it, I tried it, and I said to myself that I was going to order that the next time, and I kept to that. And it was as good as I remember. Crispy chicken breast on top of basil pasta in a parmesan cream sauce topped with thinly sliced proscuitto and arugala salad. Oh my god, so yum!

Anyway you did not wait the entire ""15 minutes"", so another 10-15 minutes is not a big deal"".  I was floored by the unapologetic and unprofessional  attitude I was addressed with. I get it that the restaurant is busy, but that does not give anyone the liberty of discounting customer treatment and making them feel like herd of cattle. This is exactly how I felt when I stepped to the right and observed that same hostess asking the restaurant's patrons to ""step to the right"" and wait there until someone escort them to their respective tables! There was no courtesy or a simple ""please"". This is when I had it.  I approached her and asked to speak to a manager; whom did not come until I asked another associate to get me one and after another good 15 minutes had elapsed. Finally a person came and said that he was one of the managers. His explanation was that they are a busy restaurant but he will talk to her.  He also had mentioned that he will personally check on us during our lunch time; but of course it was just talk to shut me up. I never saw him again. Well guess what?  I work with the public and I am a consumer myself.  I treat my clients with respect and I do not discount or ignore them.

I say uneventful because y'know when you've had a wonderful mix of all those spices, you feel like a mini roller coaster exploded in your mouth.  No roller coasters this time. I ordered a Cosmopolitan thinking maybe I need a drink for this. Nuh-uh. Did not work. This lady, I don't know if she's the manager, but she was going around asking patrons how their food is. Lucky that I haven't touched much of my food but she did look at my dish and told me it was odd looking. Now, that doesn't really appease me that someone said it was odd-looking. I immediately thought about my stomach and an image of frequent bathroom breaks. The lady immediately took my food and brought me a menu. She insisted on replacing my meal but having lost my appetite already, I just settled for the bread and butter... and downing my Cosmo. I was really pleased when we got the bill and they didn't charge me for the pasta. I thought they would and I was ready to get upset. Pleasurable experience overall.

And after I got my food, he came back and asked to see if I enjoyed it and it really seemed like he cared. He was very friendly & prompt. After that, our server switched and she wasn't nearly as awesome as Ben, but she still made an effort. The second time I was there, the server was also good. The food was delicious.

We went to the nearby B&N with our pager thinking it'd be too far and planned to head back in 20 minutes, but the pager went off in the bookstore around the 20 minute mark and we were stoked!  We were seated in a four person booth near the bar .. Not bad, as I hate those little two person tables. Not enough room to move, talk, or have a place for my plate.  David was our server, I believe. He looked REALLY busy but he made sure we were attended to and came by regularly. I LOVE the wheat bread at CF, and after I devoured the first loaf, he brought me two more! Sweeeet! I love the bread!  We ordered and got our food. The portion of fries was disappointing (got nearly double the amount at a different CF) but it was good nonetheless.

Jen K.,"Los Angeles, CA",276,161,35,2.0,12/9/2012,"So I'm not really going to comment on the food here, since it's a chain and the food is pretty good, across all their locations.  Sure their menu is way too big for its own good, but at least you know that there will be something for everyone you're eating with.  The bread is always nicely warm and the cheesecakes decadent albeit many cloyingly sweet - the best ones that I've had that aren't as sweet are the Vanilla Bean and the Tuxedo. The main issue of this review isn't even the food service, because that was just fine as well... the stinker was the management/logistics.  We came here with a party of 9 for a staff holiday lunch.  The problem: they don't take reservations!  I understand that they don't take reservations for smaller parties since they have many smaller tables and booths, but they really need to reconsider their reservation policy for larger groups... especially during the holiday season where many offices are doing their staff holiday appreciation meals. Apparently, they only have a few tables that can be assembled/used for large lunches and since other groups had beaten us to the punch, we were told that it would take about 45 minutes for us to be seated.  As we debated waiting, we stood around for 5-10 minutes when a manager came over and informed us that we could split our group into to smaller booths, which he said were next to each other.  He took us to look at the booths and yes, they were next to each other, but they were back to back, so we decided that if anything, we would rather wait for one of the group tables to open up (they ""had just gotten their entrees"" and ""would probably be done soon"" - HA, right.. because eating expeditiously is so typical of holiday lunches).  After another several minutes (and my attempts to really make things work), I asked about the patio that we saw other people sitting on, and they said that we couldn't sit there because the patio was too small and large groups are considered a fire hazard.  I figured this went for their second patio as well, so I didn't bother to ask.  As we stood outside for another 10 minutes trying to decide what we wanted to do, what our other options in the area were, the manager came over and offered to set up a table on the second patio which was significantly larger, where we ended up having our meal. While it was nice and we had a great lunch, I just don't understand why it took them so long to (point blank) get their sh!t together.  You would think that their managers would be prepped on what to do in these situations, but they obviously aren't.  I remember when I worked at another similar chain restaurant, the managers there would bust their a$$es and bend over backwards to accommodate large groups because they knew that customers = money and more customers out the door meant more money out the door (what a novel concept!!).  I hope this place pulls it together because while I'll probably go back to Cheesecake at some point in my life, I'm pretty sure it's not going to be this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1060

Maybe it was a busy holiday weekend, but I felt like we didn't have very much contact with the staff once we sat down. Also, we didn't want bread, but they didn't ask if we wanted any. We visited this one on a mid-afternoon weekend and it was really busy.  Thankfully the lunch sized portions are available until 4 pm or so. We ate the barbecue ranch chicken salad and chicken parmesan sandwich. The sandwich came with some lovely fries that were perfectly crisp and seasoned. They were the highlight of the meal for me.

So our food arrives and i started splitting it up for me and my bf and guess what!!! A fucken Pubic hair is in the carrots! Can you believe that??!!! I was so Disgusted!  I call the waiter over and she takes the plate and calls over one of the Managers. They both apologize and tell me they'll make another plate right away! I wasn't even hungry at that point but my bf still wanted to eat....  So our second plate comes and I inspected as much as I can. So my bf eats they kept checking on us making sure we were fine and they bring the bill over and come to find out they charged us twice!!! Wtf... The waitress apologizes and says she'll take it off, then comes back and they still charged for one!  I asked to talk to the Manager and she talks to him instead, they finally take  both off the price! But seriously the fact that I had to tell them to take it off the bill is annoying! Really?

We heard these were very delicious. A couple minutes later, the waiter comes back and says they are sold out of BOTH cheesecakes! How is that possible? It's the CHEESECAKE Factory! We didn't even order any other because chances are, it's sold out too. When I saw the reviews about this place I figured I'd check it out myself even though there wasn't very many good reviews.

They have a HUGE menu, and serve huge plates, so we always come home with a guaranteed meal for the next day. Service/servers is hit or miss- like any other place. They dont take reservations so have at least one person from your group sign up ahead of time to get you seated. High peak nights and weekends are BUSY so come early. Everything here is good. My usual order is wheat bread only, an appetizer, a pasta i can split with someone, and a strawberry shortcake. Every appetizer is good for whatever taste youre looking for. The Sliders are really good! (Add cheese!) For pastas- we love the shrimp bistro pasta- except that recent yahoo article had it being the WORST pasta in terms of calories to order- so we now get the garlic noodles. Still GOOD and im sure still calorie loaded. Oh well.   on a random day- i even tried the orange chicken and it was surprisingly GOOD! It tasted like fresh chicken with the orange chicken flavor, but without the oily bread shell of a typical chinese restaurants'- kinda PF Chang's Status where the chicken is more than the breaded batter.  Every time i have a family or friend get together, we eat at Cheesecake- everyone always comes out happy. Bonus: Come during happy hour.

Then we ordered the Caesar salad & White pizza lunch special along with the Ahi Tartar and cheese sticks.  Shortly after we placed our order, our server returned to tell us the White pizza had been removed from the menu :( since they recently changed it. We asked to see the menu again and decided to order the Tomato, Basil & cheese pizza with no tomatoes and add spinach to 1/2 instead of basil. In essence, the white pizza!  In the mean time, our whole order was held up while the server asked if the kitchen could add the spinach. Once she found out the kitchen would add the spinach, it was time to order our second drink & finally our lunch. Our drinks arrived quickly, then tartar & cheese sticks came out then no more than 5 minutes later...so did our salad and pizza. We put aside the pizza since it was still really hot as we finished our appetizers. The ahi was fresh & yummy. The cheese sticks were hot & melted. Then we started in on the salad. The caesar dressing was pasty white with no black pepper or Parmesan cheese. It tasted like mayo!  The lettuce was super cold & wet. Really bad!!!  We put it aside to eat the pizza. It wasn't much better. I saw there was tomato seeds on the pizza but no tomato slices. I bit into a slice and could taste the tomato juice...YUCK!  Who ever made it, forgot about the tomatoes, put them on, baked it, removed the tomatoes, added more cheese, put it back in the oven to melt then put it out to be served!  Good thing I wasn't allergic to tomatoes but I can not stand them!!  The manager came over and apologized for the error and removed it from the bill.

Plus, it is in the Americana and just outside the restaurant is the big fountain with the pretty displays. I have been here a few times and so far everything has been great. The only problem I had here was when this place first opened, the waiter gave me the wrong order. However, the mistake was quickly corrected and I left full and happy. I always make sure to save room for cheesecake by eating only half of my meal, if even that much. I have always had to wait for a bit to be seated, but it has never been too terribly long. Plus, unlike some locations, this location has plenty of seating in the waiting area. This is a place that I frequently go to on my birthday, and while I have been sung to, so have many others on that day. Who knew that my birthday was so common? The fact that I heard a birthday song every 10 minutes should give you an idea how popular this place is!

In fact some of them were still there when we were eating desert, cheesecake of course. (Which was amazing.) So as far as the food goes, *at the time* it tasted good. I had a small dinner salad, no dressing, a personal cheese pizza, a water and a coke.  I ate nothing else that night besides the cheesecake. Went straight home around 9pm. And by 11pm, my stomach started acting up. *****And yup, I threw up.***** Food poisoned??? I also called them not only once, but twice to let them know what happened. They actually questioned me on what I ate the DAY BEFORE?!  Horrible customer service. I had to speak with 2 managers. Both of them who did not return my calls.

It was a fun night because of the atmosphere and the company, but all in all I was disappointed with the food.  I would think a large chain like Cheesecake Factory should have at least a couple of yummy options for gluten free meals.  Just a suggestion.  For now I will stick with Yardhouse, or PF Chang's if I desire chain restaurant food.... they love us gluten free folks and treat us very well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1120

I was told it would be another 10 minute wait equalling it to 50 minutes. Ten minutes turned into 25 minutes and we still did not get called in. It took us close to ten minutes to be greeted by a server. The manager Sarah, i personally do not believe deserves to be the restaurant manager. She was not friendly at all and did not give any importance to us. After we had waited 50 minutes to be seated, she told us she would go check on the status of the table and was gone for a good ten minutes. The front end representatives were on top of their work more than the manager herself. After going to the front couple of times, we were finally seated. After we sat down, sarah, the manager tried to move us around so she can fit another party of 8. Very unprofessional and rude. From my knowledge a manager should be the leader of the team and lead by example. She is a very bad example to her employees. Upper management should re-evaluate the manager of the store and choose a better person to serve its clients.  I know for a fact after today i will defenitely not give my business to this company.

Why does it taste like peanut butter? I call the waitress over and ask if my cheesecake has peanut butter in it. She says yea it's the choc. chip peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake. I said, that's not what we ordered, we wanted it without peanut butter. She told us that's how it comes. So I pointed out that my bro and I were sharing and he is allergic to peanuts. All she has to offer is an I'm sorry. Okay, this didn't make sense to me at all because why would someone who is allergic to peanuts order something with peanut butter. We checked the menu as we left, we ordered correctly and she fudged it up. She could have done a number of things to redeem herself like offer us another slice or admit that she was wrong. It's not my fault you don't know your own menu. We even pointed at it on the menu when you took our order. But nooooo.  Well that's my story.

Holan N.,"Honolulu, HI",319,15,9,4.0,8/14/2010,"Cheesecake Factory. Always nice. Whether your in the Venetian Hotel in Vegas or Marina Del Ray (my mother's favorite one), expect to have great food with great atmosphere.  I always look forward to The Cheesecake Factory on my west coast trips because The Cheesecake Factory (opened 2003) in Honolulu, Hawaii does not feel the same way. This is my first time to the Glendale's location. I must say the restaurant and everything about the Americana is different. Having just finished a day with my family at Universal studios, it was great to leave the crowded areas to a nice sit down place in a district that is relaxing and seemingly away from the touristy areas (I ate at the one near Disneyland later that week and though food was the same, it felt different). Found Glendale's CF thanks to the GPS. The service was adequate. The food and the ambiance was well worth it and made me feel at peace which was what I was going for when I set out on vacation. I thought Avocado Eggrolls  was a peculiar combination. I would not considered ordering it until I asked for the waiter to suggest an appetizer. Avocado Eggrolls is different and I was surprised. It was very good. A taste I have not experienced before! I like different as eating out should be an adventure at times.

It was disgusting. If I weren't so tired I would have taken it back to the Kitchen and cooked one myself.  We thought a piece of Cheesecake would make it all better, but I was disappointed. They were tasteless, and old tasting. I looked around and wondered why were there so many people waiting to get in. Obviously not for the food.  The Manager came out and apologized. He gave us credit for one sandwich and a piece of Cheesecake Classy! I would have not charged the customer a penny, and I would have given  a complimentary gift card for a cheesecake. You get one chance to make it right!. I will not be eating at the Cheesecake factory again. There are many other Restaurants nearby that don't require such a wait, and way better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1120

Matt W.,"Palm Springs, CA",1,510,,3.0,6/25/2012,"I know CF's are always busy, but this must be one of their busiest locations. It's unbelieveable how busy they are!! They are definitely NOT shy of pouring a strong drink at this location!! The best place to sit is in the bar so you can watch the water show outside the windows behind the bar. Bar area is large and comfortable as well.  Service at the bar and by the wait staff is very good. I don't feel like they pressure people to order lots of extras like most chain restaurants do... The food itself is a 3. It always looks well presented, but we all know this isn't the highest quality stuff. It's just big hunks and piles of food. I have to say, the spinach and artichoke dip is pretty decent, though. The rest of the food was fine but nothing specially. It looks more like a decoration than something to eat.  One friend had some kind of ""Asian"" salad (I'm betting they don't have a salad this large or with this concoction of items anywhere in Asia) and it had a ridiculous amount of these noodles that were really cool looking- white, long twisty/wispy noodles. They have a simple almost non-descript flavor and it must make up 30% of this salad.  You get some bites from the salad that contain only this strange textured noodle. It's just too overwhelming. While it's a cool decoration item, it isn't good as the main part of the salad. I guess we all know that CF is more about the pomp and circumstance and less about high quality food. Chicken tenders were pretty good (but let's be real- they're chicken tenders). The mashed potatoes served with them was an enormous pile of flavorless blah. Maybe they're boxed potatoes (I'm assuming most of their food comes in frozen like Olive Garden, but maybe not?), but they could still flavor them. The corn succotash tasted like the corn had been frozen and unfrozen 6 times. It had literally 0 flavor. It was bad. The group had fun and it's one of those places to come once in a GREAT while or for drinks and maybe an appetizer in the bar. But let's be real, the food is about show not about quality or flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1120

Anna G.,"Chatsworth, CA",388,464,253,5.0,7/20/2011,"I usually order from Cheesecake during my lunch time since I do not have  many options at the Americana. Yes there are a whole bunch of restaurants/eateries at the Americana, but I have gotten tired of their food after working there for over three years. Cheesecake, and Foxy's (across the street from Barnes and Noble), have never left me disappointed. The wait staff is amazing at accommodating one hour lunches. If I am meeting friends for lunch, I always let our waiter know about my time crunch and they manage to get my food out quicker. The bakery is also very helpful when I call in to place an order. Even at their most crazy of times, they have never messed up my order. They have though, forgotten to put in utensils a few times. I would be frustrated at first but then managed to figure out a way to eat my meal since walking back to Cheesecake was out of the question. On to the food... Avocado Eggrolls =D..the green sauce is amazing. I always ask for extra dressing and ranch to dip my french fries in it. The calamari is also delicious. I love both the cocktail sauce and the tartar sauce that comes with it. For salads, I would recommend the ""something"" cashew chicken..and the chinese chicken salad. I have tried others and they have all been very tasty. For dinner I usually get the Herb Crusted Fillet Salmon with steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes. Their potatoes are amazing!! The only problem is that I can't really move after consuming all that greatness. For a quick lunch, I have ordered their Chicken Avocado Sandwich. Also very tasty and it comes with an order of fries. Everything tastes amazing at the Cheesecake Factory. I can't say I have tried the entire menu but I have gone through a whole chunk of it and have always enjoyed my meal. Their pizzas are also tasty, along with their alcoholic beverages. Try the Factory Beach Belini..yummm!!  And before I forget...It is Cheesecake so you have to try their cheesecake, duhh!

Daisy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",317,193,540,4.0,8/7/2008,"I see a lot of bad reviews here, but Im going to review based on my experience. I came to this location twice (Americana cheesecake factory). So it was my birthday, and we came here around 11 at night. This place is beautiful. It is a really nice looking cheesecake factory. Our server was really nice. He gaved us some recommendations and we asked a few questions about the menu. The pulled pork sandwich is delicious! I know, it's hard to believe that a non bbq place has great pulled pork but I've been to a lot of BBQ spot and this is by far my favorite pulled pork sandwich. It comes with coleslaw and french fries. I got the Louisiana which is really good as well but I like it without the parmesan because I'm not a fan of cheese. Also their da vinci pasta isn't bad too. My next experience was a night out with my friend. The place was packed but I didn't care I wanted to try their salad. I ordered the Sante Fe chicken salad and my friend ordered the spicy chicken sandwich. DELICIOUS. The salad was huge! But the dressing was a little strong so I recommend asking them to put the dressing on the side so you can put as much as you want prior to your likings. Her sandwich was great too. The chicken was larger than the bread which was funny but the chicken was really good. Tender and moist while nice and crispy on the outside. Only bad side was they messed up on our bill. We wanted to split the bill say put 13 on my friends card and I will pay the difference with my cash. They rung up the whole thing on my friends card. It's fine I guess because our server felt really bad. anywhos, great experiences overall!

They even have a car-wash in the parking structure! We didn't get our car washed, so I'm not sure how much they charge, but I'm all for multitasking and getting your car washed while you spend fun time w/ the family seems like a great idea to me.  So we signed up for the table w/ the hostess then went out and saw a water show they have right outside. After that we rode the trolley around the Americana (Free), which my girls loved.

Shorty P.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,204,1,4.0,8/19/2009,"I decided to give it a 4 because of the awesome service we got. I read some other yelp reviews where they had really bad experiences, but our waiter was really good. He was very polite, friendly, and attentive. He always seemed to come just at the right time, right before we even realized we needed refills. When he went on a break, he let us know ahead of time and introduced the ""relief waiter"" to us. By the way, we came on a Tuesday evening. My friend got the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad ($13.95), and judging by the way she devoured it, I think it was good. She kept raving about it. She washed it down with a Diet Coke ($2.95). I had the Strawberry Lemonade ($4.50) which accompanied my Grilled Fresh Mahi Mahi ($19.95). This normally comes with mashed potatoes and choice of vegetable, but I requested two vegetable sides instead (steamed broccoli and green beans). It was good as far as grilled fish with no sauce/dressing goes (it came with tartar sauce, but I didn't use it). For dessert, we shared the AMAZING red velvet cheesecake ($7.50). It was pretty close to perfect as cheesecakes come. I wasn't aware of the new law that restaurants have to be upfront with the nutritional information of their meals, but the waiter gave us a booklet with all the nutritional info along with our menus. My friend refused to look at it because she didn't want her meal ruined. I was planning on ordering something else (particularly the combo of shrimp scampi and grilled salmon), but when I saw how many calories and grams of salt it had...oh. my. gawd. It was pretty scary. And that was how I ended up with the mahi mahi with steamed vegetables. I didn't REALLY want it, but I didn't want to die of a heart attack either. Seriously, after going through the nutritional info, I doubt I'll be coming back anytime soon. On the plus side, eating outdoors was great because we got a nice view of the water fountain in the middle of the Americana. And for mid-August, it sure got cold by 7 pm.

The place is big and loud and dark as it is always in TCCF. We had to wait for 15min. unless we did not mind to sit outside. Heck no! Outside it is dark and loud too, so what is the difference?................15min, exactly you made my point! We had to wait for a while for our orders, it was a bussy night and next to us, a couple sat down with a child that could make SOME NOICE! I got kids too, so I did not care that much about it, but it was LOUD! We got our orders; I got the White Chocolate Raspberry Latte and was thinking about a Cheesecake, but went for the soup of the day (some Mexican soup) which was allright.  I come to the understanding that if the food is okay, the service is allright and the company your in is great! The whole experience overall not that bad is after all.

Mark K.,"Burbank, CA",250,11,4,4.0,8/31/2011,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory at the Americana. My profile doesn't show it but I was here four times in one week and I do go there for late night snacks. The portions are HUGE HUGE HUGE as everyone knows, and I can never finish them, but they satisfy me (and to me being satisfied is where I find value in a meal).  On my most recent visit I asked the waitress to recommend a burger to me and she told me to have the Green Chile Cheeseburger (it's kind of Mexican themed with tortilla chips and spicy green jalepeños). It was fricken delicious. I don't think I have ever enjoyed a burger so much, but sadly I was too full to enjoy the fries to the full extent, I recall them as yummy though. I'd recommend it for sure! Also the Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake. I hate cheesecake (and yet I still go so much). I decided to give it a try (keep in mind I haven't put cheesecake to my lips in over 12 years). IT WAS SO GOOD. Seriously, I didn't know what I was missing. Yeah, I love cheesecake now. Oh, and you have to get a Raspberry Lemonade. Delicious. Obviously, I'd go back. The service is always great and the free bread is a plus, especially the brown bread. oh yes, the brown bread. Other things I'd recommend from past visits: Ahi Tartare, The Club, Pizza/Salad Lunch Combo, Avocado Eggrolls, and Pulled Pork Sandwich. OM NOM. This location also tends to have shorter wait times than other Factories in the chain.  Happy Dining!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1140
Erica H.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,352,62,4.0,2/2/2010,"I used to work for the Cheese, at a different location. I can say I've been to a handful of locations, and I would honestly put Glendale near the top when it comes to the steps of service. I have never had bad service at this location. I would ask though why their bathrooms are so small, especially because this is the busiest location  of all of them in the US.  For food options, it's endless. If you've never been to the Cheesecake Factory, I'd highly reccommend it. Especially for bigger parties. There's always something for everyone.  My suggestions are to start with the Avocado Eggrolls and the TexMex Rolls. Order a pasta dish, a steak dish, and a salad for the table. Share all the plates. Then finish off with coffee from the coffee bar and a mudpie sundae and a slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake. You won't go wrong.

Cheesecake Factory has food runners and bussers so this guy was NEVER around) and whenever I needed something like.. a box... and the check... we could not flag him down!! And its just like.. wtf is going on through your head?? I ordered a slice of cheesecake to-go and he comes with the bag and instead of dropping our cheesecake first which would take about... 5 seconds, he checks on his other tables who aren't finished eating yet, with the to-go bag in his hands.  He just looked so awkward and omg.. it was terrible service, and I'm pretty forgiving in that department of customer service.. but this was unacceptable.  This guy was just not paying attention and he was just an air-head.  It literally took us over 5 minutes to get the bill, and it wasn't busy.  And even if it WAS busy, he was not.  He walks like he had nothing to do and he never checked up on us, but he was definitely spending a lot of time hitting on another waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1140
Mae T.,"South Pasadena, CA",8,41,4,3.0,12/29/2009,"I don't know what it is about the Cheesecake Factory (in general) that keeps me coming back even though I know it'll be the most crowded restaurant of the evening and the average wait time to be seated is at least 40 minutes to 1 hour; but, nevertheless, I came back, this time, to the Americana in Glendale location.  The food is standard. It's the same as with other Cheesecake Factories, so there's nothing on this menu that stands out from the rest. I will say; though, that Avocado Egg Rolls are an all time fave...YUMMY!! I had the Farfalle Chicken & Roasted Garlic. It was tasty, and the portions were HUGE, so needless to say, there were lots left over. The service is OK. It was so crowded inside, that the hostesses didn't really greet anyone walking in, and quickly asked for names, how many were in the party, gave out pagers, told them their wait times and along they went. On the other hand, the bar tender was quick to make our drinks, and didn't water down our drinks either so that made our wait just a tad more comfortable. Our server was also really nice. She checked back a few times to make sure we were still doing ok. OK, so I keep coming back to the Cheesecake Factory for the humongous portions. Come for dinner...have enough for lunch the next day. Most of all, I keep coming back for the consistency. No matter which Cheesecake Factory you go to, you always know what you're getting, and, so far, the service also seems to be consistent.

Joyce T.,"Glendale, CA",71,91,,1.0,10/3/2009,"No. Don't. Turn your car around and go to Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena or Sherman Oaks. I've eaten here on different occasions and only once has it been a good experience. I don't often give out 1 star, but this place deserves it. I don't understand how one dish from a restaurant chain can taste so different between locations. Don't get me wrong, I love Cheesecake Factory. My favorite dish is the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad. When I get it at the Sherman Oaks CF, the tuna is always a fresh pink with a nice sear and well-plated salad. The tuna I got last at Glendale CF was almost a gray color with plenty of tendon to chew through. If I'm consuming raw fish, I don't want it to be the color of the old laces on my shoe. On top of it all the there was salad in my dipping sauce. WHY DO YOU SEND OUT A PLATE WITH RANDOM SALAD IN THE SIDE SAUCE??? When you're spending $20+ dinner, tip, parking... you're better off going to another location for the quality. The host/wait staff have always been good and accommodating - no complaints there.

But the thing that really made me write this review was, I had forgotten my phone in the bathroom, and either some customer or employee gave it to the manager.

Anh H.,"Burbank, CA",12,36,5,2.0,12/12/2008,"So I'm not going to write a review about the food so much just because it's the Cheesecake Factory, and if you've eaten at one then you already know what the food is like. Although I do have to say that the sheer size of the menu is ridiculous because I can never decide what to get.  Anyways...I had a business lunch here today with some colleagues and vendors. First of all we had a reservation at 1pm and were there 10min early. We checked in with the desk and they rudely told us that if the entire party was not there at 1pm on the dot we would lose our reservation. Suffice it to say, we were all there on time and 15min later when asking if our table was ready yet, they informed us that they were waiting for another party to leave before seating us. Another 15min roll by and our table is still not ready and for some reason they don't think to find another open table for us. So we speak to a manager who ends up seating us in the bar area which is fine at this point since we're all starving.  So we sit down and wait another 20min before the manager brings us spinach dip and avocado eggroll appetizers on the house and tells us our drink orders will be coming soon. To which we reply that no one has come to take our drink orders.  After this point, service did get much better. Most likely because the manager made it a point to assign one of their best servers to us and frequently checked if everything was alright. It wasn't a horrible experience but since it's a huge chain, if I was going to go to Cheesecake Factory, I'd try another location and avoid the one at Americana.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1140

Spinach dip (How can you go wrong with this?) Calamari (meh, just ok)  For my main dish I ordered one of my favorites, chicken Madeira topped with asparagus, melted cheese, and covered with mushroom Madeira sauce.  It also comes with their mashed potatoes.  Farfalle pasta is also another one of my favorites that I didn't order this time.

Thought whatever and told the now only other host the same thing. This guy had serious attitude from the start. Talking down to us in a very condescending way, he mentioned it would take about 45 minutes - not great, but expected given it was a nice day at the weekend. Fine, we'll wait. How about a table outside? Maybe another 5-10 minutes. Ok - great, table outside, please. He'd already taken down a name, so we gave a cell number for them to text us when table was ready - since they'd 'run out of pagers'. As far as I knew they don't even have pagers any more... weird. We checked out things in the shops and walked around the Americana till 3:45 and decided to check when our table would be ready. Just as well we did! I went to the front of the line (as anyone does when they've already spoken with the host) to ask. The same attitude-problem guy was there and wouldn't even let me talk. ""Urgh, YOU just cut in front of all these people! You need to go the end of the line! All these people have been waiting!"" As if looking to start a mutiny among guests. Oh, HELL NO!!

Server managed to find the manager (yeahy) to help us. Sadly the manager couldn't find either our name or our number in the list...

Went to lunch with the family here, and decided to venture away from my usual cobb salad (which is fantastic) and try the chinese chicken salad...yet again a wonderful option at the factory. Topped with mandarin oranges, chicken breast, crispy noodles, and a mixed in sometype of tangy vinagarette...this salad nails it, and was plenty for dinner.  The portion was huge and priced at 12.99. The service was pretty accomodating and I was equally impressed with the grt view that we had of the ""water show"" at the americana...the ppl watching that comes along with it...doesn't hurt either:) We also ordered some type of jambalya dish that my aunt was hundred percent pleased with and my little cousin got some type of chicken bacon club with avacado slices that was fantastivc..

They ARE good. A lot of restaurants carry their cheesecakes and don't tell you that.  3 stars for the food. And it's OK. Not bad for what it is. Big variety on the huge novel of a menu that they have. For the most part, you will find something you like  and it's pretty consistant. 2 stars for the service. What is up with the servers here? Are they just burnt out or just don't care or just plain and simple not know how to serve or just have too many tables? They boast a long and intensive training program but what happens after? No follow ups? No evals? Maybe it's just my bad luck, but everytime I go to a Cheesecake, it's the same old slow, uncaring, robotic, no personality, fake, lethargic service. Trust me, DO NOT go when it' s half hour to closing time or just for desserts and coffee. The servers just absolutely HATE that. Cause, they make no $. Hence the bad service.

TWO strikes in one meal -- i hate you cheesecake factory. a month passed and the same friend and i went back to cheesecake factory because i needed to hit up the sur la table in the americana..we were starvin' like marvin' so we went back.  this time, i told myself...order something you KNOW has no dairy..like the thai lettuce wraps... STRIKE THREE Cheesecake Fucktory.  the lettuce wraps arrived on this monstrous platter...the lettuce leaves were ONLY the large, dark green, wilty messy leaves on the outtermost layers of a head of bibb lettuce and NOT the tasty, tender, inner palm-sized leaves this dish SHOULD come with.  WHY CUT CORNERS WHEN YOUR PRICES ARE INFLATED TO COVER 60% of the service, Fucktory?!  WHY WHY WHY?  it's lettuce...it only costs your restaurant 28 cents per head...WHY are you serving the bitter, tough and oversized leaves with this dish?!  WHAT HORRIBLE CULINARY PROGRAM DID YOUR SO-CALLED ""CHEF"" attend?!  moving on..  the lettuce was gross.  the coconut-curry noodles were 3 days overdue for the rubbish and unfit to consume.  the cold cucumber salad was SO OLD and water-logged the cucumber slices were CHEWY not crunchy/crisp and..the kicker... the chicken that they had PRE-GRILLED for grill-marks and MICROWAVED to put on my plate...was not only UNDERCOOKED  but even after microwaving the chicken NEVER hit an internal temperature of 165 degrees (the minimum for cooking chicken and reheating previously cooked items).  YOU CAN'T SERVE IMPROPERLY TREATED/HANDLED CHICKEN IN ANY RESTAURANT! i sent the dish back and the server seemed confused.  a few minutes later a manager came by and patronized me by squatting down next to me instead of standing like a man.  i am not a child.  i am a goddamned chef and i will not take this BS behaviour from ANYONE, especially not some marshalls-outfitted minimum wage making, cheesecake factory manager with a supercuts 'do. those of you who regularly visit the Cheesecake Factory are among the most lemming-like of all restaurant goers.  sold on the huge portions of food that contains THREE DAYS WORTH of fat grams and sodium per dish.  THE most unhealthy salads in america list posted by Yahoo included a cheesecake factory salad topping out over 2,000 calories... and the ""don't eat that, eat this instead"" list for the top 30 food nightmares served in the US... cheesecake proudly holds 4 or 5 dishes on that list -- that's about 20% of the list of the WORST FOR YOU foods in america..coming from cheesecake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1200

Adam T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,35,,5.0,9/15/2012,The Cheesecake Factory would have to be one of the best restaurants in Glendale. Once you walk in you can tell that it is a very great place. Once you come to the desk they give you a beeper that alerts you when a table is available. Once you get to your table a waitress or waiter takes your order. Your order usually come within 20 minutes. The food there is some of the best that i've ever had. If you eat with a few other people the bill usually comes out to between $60 and $100. So if you want to eat out at a very nice restaurant and you have a pretty average budget i'd recommend the Cheesecake Factory.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1240

( they do this crap throughout the nite..they need a better system... so customers are waitin awkwardly, being stopped while walkin with their hostess to their seats and servers are running into these standin groups of people gettin annoyed they almost spill the dishes, distracting everyone near by it was a hectic experience) we eventually get seated our waitress switches with a waiter and he is a dick. i mean he has an annoyed tone with us from the start. bens beer takes forever and some to come out. our friend orders her pasta with the side of sauce and it doesnt come out till nearly dinner is over and when she asks him about it he replies nonchalantly  ""um we will see i guess i have to check if theyre done with it"" what? its sauce u go and scoop it and of course he forgot but just blamed them... neways it was a nasty atmosphere everytime he came around and when we asked for water and more bread he seemed almost annoyed..i am hopin he was havin a bad day...

Daniel R.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",39,26,2,3.0,3/23/2012,"Everyone that worked there was real nice and pleasant. I don't have any bad words for them as we had a big-ish party and they were very accommodating. Still I had a so-so meal. Yes, I know, it's a big chain restaurant. A common place where regular folk can say, ""ah yes Cheesecake Factory... [enter opinion]"". Well it was my first time at one of their fine establishments and I had no idea what they served aside the obvious. Trying to find something to eat from their extensive menu is like trying to find a passage in a book. I really wouldn't mind the amount of food they had if they didn't have PAID ADVERTISEMENTS on every other page. Full page advertisements of realtors faces, back pain drawings and a bunch of other random things. You would think they charged enough for the food to offset the cost of menus. (I'm being picky.) So I tried to ask around the table for suggestions but nobody could hear me. The whole restaurant echos sounds so I had to yell across the table to be heard. That would be fine with a table full of hawks but I was hanging with certified Seniors. I guess nobody had been there before either so i was on my own. I ended up going for the ""Factory Combination"" of Shrimp Scampi and Herb Crusted Salmon. Well the Shrimp would have been really good but I only got three measily prawns. I guess I should have gone for the full order to get 6 since 3 more shrimps would have been better than that super bland Salmon.  Yet everyone else at the table seemed happy with their food so I tasted some of their chewy steak Diane and a bit of the frozen fries and yeaaaaaahh maybe it's me. If I ever get dragged there for another birthday I think I'll just get a burger. Oh and if you're expecting a bit of free cheesecake for a birthday there you'll be disappointed.

Kelly B.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,471,317,4.0,7/6/2010,"Who hasn't been to a Cheesecake Factory? If you live in Southern California it's a restaurant that is pretty hard to miss. In my 14 years in Los Angeles I have been too many times to count. For a nice establishment such as the Americana, I am disappointed by the restaurants that they host, so the Cheesecake Factory and Jewel City benefit from my repeat business. The ""repeat"" usually comes down to this: If I have a little cashola and the line doesn't appear to be long I go to the Cheesecake Factory and if shopping has been good to me and my cashola supply is low, I go for the more inexpensive Jewel City Diner. The best feature of this particular location is the patio. The inside looks and feels like every other location. With a view of the Americana's magnificent water fountain the patio at the Cheesecake Factory offers a great people watching opportunity. Add good food to the patio experience and you have made a fan of me. If for some reason you have not been to a Cheesecake Factory, all I need to tell you is two things. A) they have the largest menu known to mankind. The menu is so large they have to specially bind it with spiral wiring and B) they have great cheesecake. But the trick is not to eat too much food as to not be hungry for the cheesecake. Food at the Cheesecake Factory is consistently good. I basically order whatever I am in the mood for. Going here is just a matter of do I want a huge salad, a huge pasta dish or a huge (insert dish here). The food like the menu is huge! You could feed 2 or 3 people with the food they bring out for 1 person. And did I mention they are constantly bringing freshly baked bread out? And constantly refilling your drink. I seriously don't even know how people get to the cheesecake? In all the times I have eaten here I have only been able to get dessert a few times. I really, really, wish they would cut the portion sizes down a bit so I could eat that cheesecake more often but alas this is the way it is and this is the way it will continue to be. I just need to learn to split food with my hubby more often!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1280
Chang O.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,194,222,3.0,6/16/2008,"UPDATED: 3 stars. Came back with a larger group, was seated in a booth. The wait time was still ridiculous, but the service and the food were better than my prior experience. The review based on my initial experience follows. 2 stars. Food is a-ok. My kobe burger was delayed (the manager came out to inform of the delay but did not offer anything in return, like a complementary drink or dessert... so for all that, our server could have brought the news himself.) The delay caused the rest of the table to courteously wait for my food to arrive, despite my encouragement for them get started first... when it arrived, it still fell part, like a loose meatloaf. Service was responsive. When I asked for cream for my coffee, they brought out about half an ounce of creamer in the container... is it budget cuts, or what? The wait is horrendous. Knocked off one star solely for not taking reservations, as crowded as it gets. At the tables in the bar area, people stand around ""hawking"" for a table to clear...  not comfortable at all for diners. Expect to pay for parking, especially with the wait for tables and food, even though a small fraction of the time is validated.  Verdict: run of the mill, like any other Cheesecake factory, but crowded. It makes no sense that it would not take reservations. Half-ass validation means you're likely to shell out for parking if you spend any amount of time, whether it be enjoying your food and drink, or waiting for your table, food, and drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1280

Upon immediatelly discovering this metals in my mouth and in my swandwich as you can imagine I lost my appetiate. I not only lost my appetiate, I grow fearfull that I might of swallowed some, I still am. I took my sandwitch back and told them everything not only for my safety but for the safety of other people, who the hell knows whats in their food if not the same thing. I requested to speak to the manager. I waited and this fellow came by and I told him everything, and give him the sharps metal pieces, or atleals the ones I ddin't swallow. I told him about my fear and that I didn't feel good. I told him I wanted to find out how this sharp metal pieces ended up in my food. He said he would look into it and would let me know. Several weeks went by and this Public Relations lady called me never acknowleding sharp metals or telling him how they got in my sandwich, was fake and didn't know what she was even calling about. Again I told her I wanted to find out how this happened so this doesn't happen again. Well she said she would get back to me. Shortly after that I got a letter that didn't mention the incident nor an explaination about an investigation, basically saying that we had agreed to this gift $40 dollar gift card. I never agreed to that she LIED.  I wanted to know why those shart metal pieces were in my food and was concerned about my health and of those poor souls that were or will be eating in that restaurant or any of their other restaurnats . I NEVER used there stupid gift card and never will because I WOULD NEVER EAT AT CHEESECAKE FACTORY. They don't care about their customers all they tried to do cover their ASSES and pretent nothing happened. THEY THINK that people are that stupid that's what they thinkg of their customers. Never ming that I could have DIED or could still have internal injuries or other people could have been in the same situation as me except they never realized it. CHEESECAKE factory you suck and your EVIL bastards. I guess they think OH who cares if a  few people DIE or suffer injuries as long as nobody knows about it.

Jackson B.,"New York, NY",12,55,1,3.0,7/2/2008,"Why is the Cheesecake Factory so damn popular?   Without a doubt, I would bet that every Cheesecake Factory consistently has a wait around dinner time around the country...... what is the fascination?  I don't get it. Personally, I think that they have a major staffing issue.  I have been to numerous locations where there was a wait, but yet plenty of empty tables.....  Also, since this one in Glendale opened near my home, I tend to walk down there late at night for a slice of cheesecake (bad, I know) -- and yet, at 9:30 on a Monday, there is still a freakin wait.... As for the review.... If you really want to eat at the Cheesecake Factory -- expect a wait.  No you can't call ahead.  No you can't make a reservation.  They simply don't care.   The menu is so huge that is puts a Jersey Diner to shame.... you can really eat anything you want.... most of it is pretty good.  If you're easily overwhelmed, I suggest opening the menu and ordering the first thing that catches your eye.... if you keep looking... you could be there all day long .... holding that table... keeping me waiting... I have never had bad service at one..... other than waiting for a table..... forever....... but hey, the weather is nice ... enjoy the fountain show... or something. That's about it.   It's really not worth it.... it's close... it's everywhere.... food is fine.... but there are plenty of other places where you can get good food without waiting forever... BUT -- The cheesecakes are AMAZING..... but you can just walk up to the counter to get a slice of those....

We sat in the bar area because it was happy hour time and I didn't want to wait for a booth but lo and behold this location doesn't have happy hour... wth??!! Next, the service was horrendous. I think I got a neck cramp from  continuously turning my neck in all sorts of direction looking and waiting for our server to come. The other servers and busboys passed us by many times with a ""I'm going to smile at you, but that's it"" look. Fifteen minutes in and our order hasn't been taken and the complimentary bread  and utensils were still MIA.  Mind you free parking at the Americana is only for 1 hour and after the first hour you gotta fork up 3 buckaroos.   We eventually got to order some grub and thank God the wait for it wasn't too long but geez, the lady who brought our food was a BIG grouch. No ""hi, enjoy your food"" or a smile. We didn't get checked up on and the water refills came right before we got our cheesecake. Overall, it was one of the worst experiences I've had in a LONG time. The only thing that saved the day were the delicious slices of cheesecake that left a huge smile on the fam's face.  Count me out for a comeback and if you decide to come here avoid the waiter that looks like Perez Hilton.

Kiara W.,"Glendale, CA",1,7,,3.0,4/4/2009,"For me Cheescake Factory is Cheesecake Factory. Its good, but it gets old. However, I will review it for those CF rookies out there.  Lets start off with the bread: The white bread is good, but tough. The brown bread, pumpernickel I believe is DELICIOUS with butter if its warm. When the bread comes warm, eat the brown one first because its ONLY good warm. If you have the choice try to order ONLY brown bread in your basket.  Drinks: Iced Tea is good here. Caramel Macchiato is nice. Apple Cider's always fizzy. No complaints here.  Appetizers : Tex Mex egg rolls are good, nothing TOO great, but a nice starter. A bit filling though, so I'd recommend these on a day when you are feeling like a salad or sandwich.   My favorite thing in the whole restraunt has to be the Sweet Corn Tamales Cakes. They are sweet creamy corn patties with salsa and sour cream on top. I could eat these as a meal, but they are good to share.  Food: BLT Salad is very good and simple, but the salads here are huge, so consider splitting it and getting a soup or salad on the side. Or save room for desert :) White Chicken Chili is another one of my favorite, its not an average tangy chili, its more of a rich creamy style chili. It is served on top of rice and the best part is when you get the liquid from the chili and the rice together ! Mouth-gasm. So good! Very big bowl here too. If you plan to save half, always make sure you save a bit of rice to go along with it. Also it heats nicely in a skillet as opposed to the microwave.  Orange Chicken is not good. Chicken is dry and the orange sauce was taken far to literally, and it tastes like orange juice was poured on top of bland fried chicken, to be basic.  Pasta Bolognese is OKAY. OKAY i mean very OKAY average. The sauce is very sweet although it has meat, maybe its supposed to be like that, but for is it is highly off putting. So that was a one time order. I ordered it with truffle oil; not sure if that added or took away from the dish. Cuban Sandwich comes in second after Portos. Very good annd a good portion although im not too  fond of the fries there. Mostly I just eat the sandwich. Very buttery & crispy. Cheesecakes are good. I like the Banana and the Dulce De Leche one personally. :) happydining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1220

The chicken comes out on this Texas toast that's buttered and crispy.  Have a side of the Raspberry Mojito or a glass of White Wine and  you are good to go.

Peter E.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/5/2009,"I went to this restaurant to celebrate 3 birthdays last night.  The waiting lobby only had a few people which allayed my fears of a long wait.  We had 9 people and our party and were told to expect a 40-45 minute wait for a table.  We ended up waiting more than 1 1/2 hours with no table in sight.  Apparently, the hostess was waiting for another large party to leave (they hung around for an hour after they were done eating).  I can't believe they couldn't find another place to seat us - they just kept waiting for this other party to leave.  To top if off, when a couple of people with us complained to the manager (or assistant manager), he did not believe that we were waiting that long.  So, there was no effort on his part to get us seated.  We ended up leaving and going to La Cubana on Maryland across from Tony Romas (actually more directly across a tux shop).  We got there 20 minutes before closing and they stayed open 40 minutes after closing.  Food was great!!!  Next time, no more Cheesecake Factory for me - the food is really not worth that wait.  Plus, at least, in this one, the employees/management don't seem to care that their customers are waiting for more than 1 hour (on a weeknight!!!) to get seated, much less start eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1300

They started us off with a complimentary bread basket with a few different types of bread including a delicious brown bread with some sort of oats. It was mildly sweet and quite tasty. I was disappointed in Cheesecake Factory. I know given the name I should not expect healthy fare, but given the enormous menu I could not believe that they had practically NO vegan items. Seriously? Your menu is practically ten pages long and you can't manage to refrain from putting meat or cheese on most of the salads? Pretty disappointing.

Karolina G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",14,24,1,4.0,8/13/2009,"Everytime I go here, I get great service and the food comes out really quick. The problem is the wait, but you have to expect it at the Cheesecake Factory. I go straight to the bar and get a drink and appetizer and sometimes I just stay there and eat my lunch because the atmosphere is very comfortable. The drinks are always perfect (never weak) and the view from the bar adds to the nice ambiance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1260
Eddie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,27,,2.0,12/11/2009,"First I am going to rate this place, because of the service... it sucks! And it starts with the hostess, these chicks maybe incompetent, or flat out dumb or suffer from from dementia. I waited so long to be seated, I saw couples and pairs who came in way after  mt wife and I get seated ahead. Second the menu is different compared to the other Cheesecake Factory, for the worst.   The service from the servers is cool, but that waiting really ticked me off. This CF is the closest to where I live. I will continue to go to the one in Arcadia or Sherman Oaks, better service, atmosphere, and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1260
Riz V.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,4.0,1/30/2012,"Love love love CF in Americana! Nice location, great food, great view! My friends and I huddled here after a relaxing walk one afternoon during my trip there last week. Appetizers are filling and breads are given generously! Hummus ftw!

Torio V.,"San Francisco, CA",363,4,,5.0,1/24/2012,"Oh man, this factory truly is the bee's knees.  If you go, ask for Kevin to be your server.  Then sit back and enjoy, cause you're embarking on an adventure that includes not just dinner, but also a show.  If you ask him to refill your soda, he will totally do it.  FOR FREE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1260
Elizabeth R.,"Manhattan, KS",42,28,,2.0,5/5/2011,"I love Cheesecake so when I was going to this restaurant I had high hopes and expectations. I was completely wrong. As the hostess was walking us to our seats, the busboy had to clean the table, so we were asked to wait. That was no big deal but as soon as the bus boy finished cleaning, another couple was sat. We were then run around until we were sat at a small two person booth in the corner, I was just glad we got a seat. After we ordered our meal and finally received some glasses of water, I accidentally spilled my glass. I wasn't expecting them to come right away and clean it up, but it would have been nice if i was able to get some service. I ended up using my napkin and my friend's napkin to try and clean it up but it was like a full glass that was knocked over. When the waiter finally came back to give us our food I told him that I had knocked over my glass, I was given another drink and a few napkins to clean up the rest myself. We ended up sitting there with water soaked napkins at one end of our tiny table. Needless to say I didn't stay for desert, I was ready to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1260
Kristen D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,41,,4.0,6/4/2009,"Well aside from the weirdo host guy who trying to force the outside seating on us, my girlfriend's birthday dinner was a big success.  Originally intending on eating sushi, we happened by CF and since it smelled good and the menu was HUGE, we went for it.  Activate weirdo host sequence.  BUT!  He did take note when I said, ""It's HER BIRTHDAY, so wherever she wants to sit we're sitting...""  And we got a nice booth.  DRINKS!  Who doesn't love a good L.I. ice tea?  Or two!  Girlfriend got something vodka and fruity that tasted like smarties to me.  We order those, but the server immediately got us some ice water, brilliantly skirting the issue of CA water's supply by ASKING us if we'd like some water to start.  How nice!  And she was QUITE good...re-visiting us an appropriate amount of times during the course of our meal.   We get 2 appetizers.  The fire-grilled artichokes came with 2 dipping sauces that were SUBLIME, but the artichokes themselves hardly even needed extra flavor.  And we get the infamous avocado egg rolls which totally lived up to their infamous status.  I have now printed a copy-cat recipe and I am determined to replicate in my own kitchen.  Also a nice dipping sauce, also hardly needed, as the egg rolls were SO flavorful.   Yeah that bread is decent.  I tried not eating much of it to save room for the meal.  I worried that the brown one was rye, but it was actually pumpernickel and a lot better than I thought it would be. Entrees.  For once we get the SAME dish.  Jamaican black pepper shrimp.  Eh, not so good.  Or at least not what I expected.  The shrimp were small and the tails were pulled off.  I think there was too much curry in the sauce.  I was expecting more pepper, and less ""sauciness"" anyway.  I dunno, I've made better shrimp at home.  White rice and black beans went well with it, and I was so impressed with the appetizers and drinks that I will come back.  Order a different entree tho. OH and then came the little birthday sundae and several members of the staff to effectively embarrass my girlfriend with the birthday song.  So I was happy the host caught me mentioning her birthday despite his weird fixation with outdoor seating.  All-in-all a good experience!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1260

Sintiea S.,"New York, NY",119,332,,3.0,12/6/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the places every one pretends to hate but ends up eating there anyway because it's the only thing that every one grudgingly agrees to. I personally don't dislike it but I don't love it either. DON'T go on a weekend night unless you enjoy bitching about how long it takes to get seated and order. If you want a more pleasant experience go during the day for lunch. During the weekends, and especially holiday season, the wait can be super long and the service not so great. You will probably end up sitting outside next to a crying baby with straw wrappers surrounding your chair. Also, feel free to share...the portions are way to huge for one person alone. The menu...well I don't reallt know if I would call it a menu...it's more like a book. The menu/book has a lot of options so overall, it's okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-glendale-2?start=1260
