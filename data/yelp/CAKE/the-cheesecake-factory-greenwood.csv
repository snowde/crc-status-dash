Doug T.,"Greenwood, IN",0,6,,5.0,11/14/2017,"One of my favorite places to eat.  Food is excellent and the cheesecake is to DIE FOR!!!  Like others have said, going at peak times can extend your wait times for service but if you keep that in mind, you will have a wonderful meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=20
Alajawan P.,"Zionsville, IN",40,22,40,4.0,8/10/2017,"What is there not to love about fried macaroni and cheese balls amazing!!!!! When dinning the cheesecake factory you can rest a sure that there will be something tasty for everyone. It's a Classic American  menu with the wide variety of options. The inside is very well decorated with a elegant vibe, my dining experiences was very  pleasurable. The Cheesecake Factory is a perfect place for a great for date night, or a birthday dinner. You have to absolutely try the fried macaroni and cheese balls as an appetizer and they are simply amazing and one of the main reasons why my family and I dine at the cheesecake factory because the macaroni and cheese balls are fried to perfection with crispy crunchy golden outside and a nice creamy layer of cheesy macaroni goodness on the inside ...food for the gods !!!! For dinner I order the filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Steak was prepared very well, and side also matched full of flavor.  Now for desert .....how do you come to the cheesecake factory without dining on a piece of cheesecake ???? I ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it was absolutely everything I expected and much more delicious!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=20
Jalee L.,"Indianapolis, IN",124,122,244,4.0,12/30/2016,"The only thing I'm dinging them for- They don't take reservations or even call ahead on weekends or evenings. Making a dinner there a guaranteed wait time.  My favorite thing about The Cheesecake Factory- Their giant menu. It has every type of cuisine so no matter how large your party everyone can find something delicious (or many things!). Hence my recommendation to put your wait time to good use by asking for menus and mulling over your carvings prior to getting seated. As a creature of habit I usually go with the Spicy Cashew Chicken (ps- you can ask for it not spicy!) Every once in awhile I will mix it up and go for the chicken pot pie smothering biscuits or one of their numerous pasta selections.  I am also a fan of large portions. Their prices are a little steep for one meal, but when you make it two the math works out perfectly every time.  And of course we must mention their cheesecake. I've never had a bad piece and this is definitely an area of the menu that I like to mix it up. My favorite piece that I truly melted over was at my most recent stop- Their Peppermint Bark Cheesecake. It was light and fluffy, not a true dense cheesecake and it has the slightest hint of chocolate to balance the mint. Not to mention the sprinkling of peppermint bark on top. Delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=20
Zachery S.,"Indianapolis, IN",94,5,1,1.0,3/19/2017,"Worst experience from a restaurant and only been here 20 mins.  If you want a hostess to speak to you as if you are a idiot please feel free to come here.  Then to be seated and be pushed past by a waiter.  Nope I'm good thanks though.  We did the ""call ahead"". Just to sit and wait 30 mins.

Beth A.,"Indianapolis, IN",153,3,,1.0,7/26/2017,"Everything took a long time this evening. Our server was not available most of the evening. Everything was backed up per the server, the excuse for the long wait on food, bread, and desserts.  Bread was offered but never brought to our table.

Jesse W.,"Columbus, IN",18,19,88,3.0,10/23/2016,Why the 3 stars? Just because of the simple fact that the food is pretty bad. My girlfriend and I ate here twice and both times it was just horrible. So we've decided to only eat here when we are in the mood for their cheesecake. Thats the only reason we come here is for their cheesecake.       Also the only reason they got 3 stars was because they take more pride in making their cheesecakes than they do with their regular food. Their cheesecakes are the best I've ever had.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=20
Brandon S.,"Greenfield, IN",32,72,97,3.0,3/27/2016,Always love the Cheesecake Factory.  This was a Monday night and we wanted to try on a less busy night which it wasn't busy at all.  We got seated right away.  Once seated we where asked for drinks.  We got water.   On my wife's water cup it looked like it had not been washed.  It had major floatage.  Something crusty around the inside.  She didn't notice until after drinking for a a few minutes.  We let waiter know.  He immediately got fresh cup.  The food after that was very tasty and the service was very good.  Bread was good as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=20

Jason A.,"Indianapolis, IN",18,215,2,4.0,3/6/2016,"Just like Webber grill and Bonefish, Cheesecake is one of those chain locations I have no real problem with. Not sure I would have spent my own money here but had a $50 gift card with 2 complimentary slices of cheese cake, so yeah I'm down. Like others have commented the menu is the size of War and Peace, can you imagine prep time for all of that? Decided on the grilled pork chop, wife got the bang bang chicken and shrimp combo, kid got the grilled cheese. Pork chop was good, moist all the way through, sides of mashed potatoes and green beans were competent, wife's meal was good, too much rice for me even the kids grilled cheese was good.  Service was kind of slow, slammed for a Sunday afternoon our waitress was overwhelmed, once it lightened up was much more efficient she was very nice and apologetic. Cheesecake was wicked good, huge not sure what it cost as it was free, if it's free it's me, could have ate the whole thing myself, kid and wife got in the way.  I know it's hip to bash chains, but really every time I've eaten here I can't complain, would I have eaten here without a gift card? Meh it's a push, if somebody else is buying, I wouldn't complain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=20

Tiffany K.,"Bloomington, IN",67,129,708,5.0,8/19/2016,"I've been wanting to come here since last year but with the construction in Martinsville, it is hard for me to get from Bloomington to Greenwood. We drove up to Greenwood on a fairly busy day for the Cheesecake Factory, but the wait wasn't too bad. All the staff members were really friendly. We didn't have any problems ordering. They had a wide selection of all kinds of food, and of course, cheesecake. The only thing i wish they did have was a cheesecake menu at the table at all times. My boyfriend asked our waiter if we could keep a menu for later. That was a very good idea on his part. I saw other customers having to ask their server for menus later on and that just seemed very inconvenient for these busy servers. Everything we had was simply amazing. My boyfriend did state that he couldn't really taste the mac and cheese balls on his burger, but I would eat that chicken and biscuit everyday if I could. Neither my boyfriend or I are very big cheesecake fans, but we did share an Oreo cheesecake, and it was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=20

My friend and I started with the portabella, avocado, and zucchini fries ( yum!), then split the macaroni and cheese burger. A) Glad we got it! B) Glad we split it! Such great flavor and texture! We should have split the cheesecake, too. Woof. I always forget how overwhelming their big desserts can be! Tasty, but overwhelming.

S H.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,10,,5.0,2/21/2017,"Best meal I've had out in a long time. Probably in about a year. And I eat out a lot. I was just looking for a good meal somewhere that wouldn't close at 10, and I am really glad this was about the only nice place open in the area. The menu is monstrous, so maybe I just got lucky but the Thai chicken was amazing. Drinks are overpriced ($4.50 for OJ? $8 milkshakes??), but what are you gonna do. Just save your sugar fix for their eponymous cheesecake. My waitress, Peyton, was ever-present without being overbearing, which is actually a very hard balance that most restaurants seldom ever seem to manage.

We started with the house made guacamole, which was super yummy.  Seriously, though, guacamole is kind of like pizza.  Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.  I spent many years not eating guacamole without ever trying it.  I declared that I didn't like it, despite not really knowing. I'm a weirdo like that sometimes.   I had fish tacos and Philip had some kind of pork bbq sandwich.   Portions are huge.  Fish tacos don't reheat well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=20

Don't make the mistake we did and think that you can request a channel change in the bar--even if the bar is empty. And even after bringing the poor behavior of an assistant manager to the attention of the GM, not only was my experience not validated or taken seriously, but to not be wise enough to ask what she could do to win our business back.

Abigail M.,"Greenwood, IN",21,4,2,5.0,1/4/2018,"My boyfriend and I came to the Cheesecake Factory. We had ordered the Chicken & Cheese Quesadilla for an appetizer, following with our main courses: The Macaroni & Cheeseburger and the Parmesan & Herb crusted Chicken.       This restaurant is absolutely phenomenal! Their facility/restrooms are always spotless clean, with an artistic decor that is stylistic and refreshing. The waiter/waitress staff are always prompt, knowledgeable on the restaurants' food and beverages. They're also sharply dressed, and on their toes, and show impeccable customer-service skills at all times.      The food is made from pure scratch, and their beverages are always fresh. The prices are about the same as Olive Garden, however, you receive much better quality food and service here than at Olive Garden. You definitely get your money's worth at the Cheesecake Factory.

Nikki M.,"Indianapolis, IN",27,12,1,2.0,9/24/2017,"Unfortunately, I don't think we will be back to the Greenwood Cheesecake Factory location. Our food was fine and our server Peyton had a terrific personality and great attitude despite being slammed in a bar area she had to herself. I could even forgive that the hostess stand messed up and underquoted our wait time by nearly double (quoted 40 min, but sat in us 75 for a table of 5). What did it for me was witnessing the hosts tell a manager the situation, watching the manager come to the host stand and avoid eye contact and refuse to acknowledge us. Then when we were being seated, I expressed my displeasure about the excessive wait time to the host who said she would have a manager come speak with us.  A manager never came. It would have cost the restaurant nothing to simply come and say, ""we messed up and we are sorry you had to wait longer than we told you, but we are glad you stayed. Let us make it up to you."" Instead, nothing.  The ONLY reason we didn't leave was we were celebrating my step-daughter's birthday and she chose this restaurant 2 weeks ago and has been looking forward to it. We have celebrated her birthday there every year for the last 4 years. We waited because it was what she wanted, but she even said afterwards that she won't choose here next year because no one ever came to apologize.  I worked in restaurants all through high school, college, and graduate school. I know how things work. We weren't looking for anything for free, but a manager who cares about their restaurant and their server knows that evaluating the satisfaction or lack thereof by a patron is fundamental to the success of the business. It is essential to ensure a server isn't subjected to an irrationally angry customer as much as it is to win over a dissatisfied customer and ensure they come back.  As far as chain restaurants go, I had considered (up until recently) Cheesecake Factory a step above the likes of Applebee's, Chili's, or TGI Friday's. This experience tonight showed me it isn't any better from a service perspective, it just has a larger menu and a higher price point.  For the money, there are better places to go like Stone Creek, Fireside, or Revel. Skip the chains and spend your money with locally owned establishments who value their customers. That's what my family will be doing from now on when dining out on the south side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood
Clumxee W.,"Indianapolis, IN",24,2,,3.0,8/4/2017,Dinner time! We had a 30 minute wait. Food was great but service was slow. :) We waited for a good 10 minutes for our waiter to get us a refill. The miso salmon was so good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood
JR F.,"Plainfield, IN",23,61,56,3.0,6/11/2017,"Overall a great experience as far as food and service, but there were a few draw backs to dining at the Cheesecake Factory.  Walking in your greeted by the hostess in their spacious waiting area and right in front of you is a giant display of all of their mouth watering cheesecake options. Seriously, so mouth watering. The average wait time is about 15-30 minutes but lucky for us, we were seated immediately.  The menu has a WIDE variety of food ranging from pasta and salad to steaks and shrimp. The portions provided are very large and definitely something you'll have to pack up and take home. However the cocktails were pricey for what they were. Nothing special or unique. Just expensive. (AND THE MULES ARE NOT IN COPPER CUPS!? What?)  The restaurant has many seating options for all different party sizes. (Long tables, high tops, bar top, booths, outdoor patio) whatever you may prefer they'll have a table for you. My main complaint is that the tables are very close to each other and it makes for a impersonal experience in my opinion. Also, this place is extremely expensive for what it is, we paid $90 for two people. Glad I got to try it but I probably wouldn't return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood
Tori C.,"Indianapolis, IN",29,106,95,3.0,6/9/2017,"My boyfriend and I had both never tried the Cheesecake Factory before and decided to try it out on a Friday night for our anniversary. We both had friends that told us it wasn't worth it, but we actually both really enjoyed it. I don't think we would have picked it as our anniversary dinner if we had been there previously and knew what to expect, but we are still glad we tried it.  We were seated immediately around 7:30pm on a Friday night, but the table was less than ideal. We were at one of those really long booth areas with small tables and then chairs on the other side. Convenient when pushed together for large parties, inconvenient on a date when there are two different couples approximately 2 feet away on each side. We could hear both conversations throughout the dinner. We were disappointed we got sat there because there were plenty of open tables, but I'm sure they had their reasons so we didn't ask for a change.  We each got an alcoholic drink. Sangria for me, pineapple mule for my boyfriend. The menu didn't have prices for alcohol and once we got the bill we were less than thrilled to see they were $10.50 each. Pretty steep price.  The meal includes complimentary bread and butter, which was good, but not spectacular. I ordered the chicken parmasean pizza style -- it was DELICIOUS. It was off the ""special"" menu inserted. It was a large chicken coated in bread crumbs and covered in marinara in cheese. My boyfriend truly thought it was a pizza. Then on top there was angel hair pasta in alfredo sauce. I loved it -- he wished he had ordered it too. He got the four cheese pasta and added chicken. He liked his, but was definitely envious of mine. The servings were big enough to fill us and we both still took leftovers.   We got a slice of the Adam's peanut butter and caramel cheesecake to go. Very good and just the right size for us to share! The menu also didn't list prices for cheesecake -- $8 for this particular slice (not sure if that varies??) Overall -- delicious food and we were glad we finally tried the place out. However, the meal was $75 for two people before tip which was pretty pricey. This is definitely not a place that I would go to ""just because."" Yet it didn't really fit the bill as a formal restaurant either. It was one of those in the middle type restaurants -- great and expensive food but still casual (and crawling with kids)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood

This is tricky unless you want breadsticks or pizza, neither of which I wanted. I was so happy to see options on the menu and even more so to actually eat the avocado eggrolls. They are so flavorful! It's actually an appetizer and I could only eat about half. As always, the portions are generous here. During previous visits, I have really enjoyed the factory chopped salad. It has a great mix of chicken, bacon, lettuce, dressing, and a whole bunch of other tasty ingredients... including avocado.

DonnieBillie P.,"Madison, IN",11,12,5,2.0,9/23/2017,"We took our adult kids out to a birthday dinner Thursday evening. We had a very personable and professional waiter who took out order in a reasonable amount of time. Everything after that was very unfortunate I got my meal and we waited for the other three. The manager came out and explained something about a problem producing my husband's order and  asked if he'd like anything else. He didn't have time to wait and then eat so he declined. Eventually my sons meal arrives and he was happy with it. After another wait of about 10 minutes the birthday girl's chicken alfredo arrived. By then I had been done for a while, and my son was nearly finished so he ordered dessert.  Birthday girl found a tiny worm I her meal after a couple bites. The manager was very apologetic and professional as well. She brought out a full cheesecake in apology.  Birthday girl ordered another meal and eventually a birthday choir sang to her and brought her a slice of Oreo cheesecake. Which she loved.  My son still didn't have his dessert. We asked again.  In the end, we were charged only for the 2 alcoholic drinks.  We appreciate the comp and the nice staff but this place was having serious issues.

It is a mid-scale restaurant, clean and nicely laid out. There was a very long wait time (close to 40mins) when we got there, but then again, we went on a Saturday. Everything on the menu sounded so delicious that it was hard picking an item. I ended up getting the Renee's special which included a choice of sandwich, cup of soup, and salad.I got the chicken salad sandwich, potato soup, and Caesar salad. The brown bread is awesome, and the meal was fantastic! I was extremely hungry by the time we got seated, so that might have contributed to everything tasting extremely good. Anyway, dinner was topped with a slice of mango key lime cheesecake. I had to take my dessert to go since i was extremely full after the main dish. The cheesecake was extremely good, light and sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood

Marie R.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,5,,5.0,2/2/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory.  I really love the one at the Greenwood Mall.  And there are only two in the entire Indianapolis metro area, which leads me to my only complaint:  They are ALWAYS packed and wait times can sometimes be lengthy.  In good weather, no problem because you can wait outdoors; however, in rainy or cold weather, you are packed like sardines in a small area.  Ugh!!!! Now the good things:  The 32 page menu with so, so many excellent choices!  The wonderful, knowledgeable servers who hustle and work hard for a living and will do their best to make you a satisfied customer if you give them a chance.  I have been there three times in the past three months and enjoyed everything I tried each time.  My favorite was the miso salmon, which I cannot rave on enough about.  I also liked the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta; however, I really like spicy foods and this could have been spicier for my palate, but is still great as is and this is not a complaint.  I love potstickers, and their chicken potstickers do not disappoint!  YUM!  The Caramel Royal Macchiato is to die for and is huge.  It was great after coming in from a cold winter day of shopping.  It was like having dessert.  Everyone I dine with LOVES the cheesecake......of course!  When I eat dessert, which is not very often because I am too full from the wonderful food offerings, I prefer plain cheesecake and it is wonderful.  My friends prefer the many and varied flavors offered and they are always happy with them.  I also enjoy the pleasant atmosphere of Cheesecake Factory.  I realize some people complain about the prices at Cheesecake Factory, but I personally do not feel you are paying too much, considering all you get: the atmosphere, great servers, huge portions and wonderful flavors.  I also appreciate that there are lunch size portions available until late in the afternoon at reduced prices, but their ""lunch portions"" are still very large, in my opinion.  And, as unusual as it may seem, their lunch portions are available on weekends, not just week days like some places.  Overall, I give Cheesecake Factory at Greenwood Mall two thumbs up and will definitely return......OFTEN!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=60

We go next store to Barnes and Noble for a bit and after 50 minutes check back in to make sure we didn't miss our summoning. I was told at that time it'd be abother 10-15 minutes. Ok, sounds about right.  30 minutes later. I go to make sure we haven't been skipped or overlooked or forgotten or erased because surely the people who came in after us shouldn't be getting seated as quickly as they were.  I'm told that they paged us 'about 20 minutes ago' and was asked, 'did your pager not go off?' Um, clearly it did not. That is the reason for our current conversation and I was actually standing here talking to you right around the time that you say we were 'paged'.  You came through shouting the name for a party of 6 at least 3 times but never once called out for our party of 3. There were no apologies, no recognition of a problem or mistake or miscommunication or anything on their end. They wanted to act like heroes because they 'could seat us immediately'. I'm not impressed, we should have been seated 20+ minutes ago. Offer me an apology or a free appetizer or something for our wasted time.

They have perfected nearly every dish - as I've never had something here that was bland or anything but delicious. The salads are always fresh and this is one of the few places in Indy you can get pine nuts added to a caesar salad (try it!), the Italian dishes here are divine, as is the pan-Asian cuisine. Personally I like to order a few small plates and share among the table since the portions of some items can be HUGE and overwhelming. The corn cakes are one of my favorites and the cheese bites are great too. And you can't forget about the cheesecakes - over 20 options to choose from!

During these 25 minutes a woman was seated next to us and had gotten bread, order taken, order delivered, and had just asked for a to-go box. After receiving our bread we waited another 30 minutes for our lunch, which was grilled salmon, to arrive. It was delivered by a different server and in fact the only time our server interacted with us was to get our drinks, tell us he'll get our food right away (yeah...ok 55 minutes for salmon), and he was very quick about getting payment.  My mother and I both felt he neglected us because we didnt look as well off as the other 2 tables and therefore probably wouldn't tip well.

The atmosphere at this particular location feels very much like a slightly-fancy place for suburban families.  Dressing up isn't necessary, but one might be out of place wearing jeans with holes in them.   The menu itself is riddled with just downright interesting dishes.  Lots of high quality pasta (as you might expect), but also neat twists on more standard dishes.  Check out their omelets.

Though it is always packed in the weekend (both locations and it is also true for its Chicago area location), I stil think this is a fun place to go with your family, friends or just as a couple for any special occasion.  Also, the noise level is high, but we can still make a good conversation. Their menu is very extensive - from breakfast menu, pizza, pasta, Asian, and many more - that will definitely please everyone (...or might confuse the first timer ;) ) young or old.  This particular location in Greenwood - service is good, but the place is small compared to other CF location at Keystone or other states. Be prepared for the long wait in the weekend evenings - it can be 1 to 1.5 hours long. In this case, you may as well go eat at the mall foodcourt and finish the meal plus ice cream from Maggie Moo's in less than 1 hour, then browse the books at BN store for half hour, and you can come back for a cheesecake...LOL... Their price tag is moderate, at $11-$17 per entree, or more for specials and steaks. Appetizer costs at around $8-$10. You can easily spend $125 or more plus tip for a family of 5 (= 2 adults + 3 children under 10). However the meal is huge and you can always share, especially the dessert - because you will be full by the time you are ready for it. Remember, you can also order ""lunch"" until 5pm - the price is about $2-$3 less from regular price, but the portion size is still BIG... Thai Lettuce Wrap is a good one to try for appetizer. Their guacamole is good too. I love their Crispy Spicy Beef. The kids' meal is well prepared and it comes with a drink. My favorite dessert is Strawberry Shortcake that I usually share with my husband - it is delicious and a great dessert to end the big meal. Their coffee is very good too (maybe it is Illy coffee?). But if you have room, you should always try their cheesecake. Ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake is my new favorite one. CONS: Previously, my favorite was Bistro Shrimp Pasta - I love the breaded shrimp and arugula in it. I could only have 3-4 bites and have plenty left over for the next days. However, this dish is in the ""not that"" list according to David Zinczenko ""EAT THIS NOT THAT"" with 2,730 calories 78 g saturated fat, 919 mg sodium, 141 g carbohydrates Many of their dishes are loaded with fat and sodium, and high calories.

We arrived before their dinner rush and we had a very short wait; we put our name in and almost immediately got called for our table. The hostess brought us to our table and was very pleasant but when we got to our booth the seats were COVERED in bread crumbs and the hostess watched as my fiancée knocked off all of the crumbs so we could sit instead of taking us to another table that was actually clean. It looked as though a large group of rowdy two year olds crushed up all of the bread and  and threw it on the floor and on our seat. It was not  clean at all. After sitting down I noticed the music was very loud and we were struggling to hear each other. Our server arrived she didn't tell us of any specials or suggest us any dishes she just asked what we wanted. But she was very nice. We ordered our drinks and shortly after they arrived and she also brought bread. Which she forgot to give us plates for our bread. Which is very small inconveniences but they add up. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 like I wanted to is because of the food. It was delivered about 15 minutes after we placed our order. It was all very fresh! I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp, my fiancée and his grandmother got the Catfish, and his brother got the Ribeye cooked medium-well. We all enjoyed our dinners the only complaint was about the green beans and the steak was mostly fat. At the end of our meal we all ordered cheesecake.

One of the meals was luke warm as if it had sat for a while waiting  to be served. Offers to refill drinks were not made...I had to ask for a to go refill, even though my glass was empty during much of the meal, and this request took an extreme amount of time, even though we'd communicated more than once the need for us to go.  We asked for our cheesecake to go since we'd indicated a need to leave in a timely manner. When it finally came, there were no forks/spoons, so I asked a bus boy.

The restaurant chain has locations spread throughout the U.S. and today I visited the Greenwood location for an Easter afternoon lunch with my lovely parents. Upon walking into the restaurant, my first thoughts were that the place was very nice and that it had an almost ""high-end"" feel to it. When I was presented the menu, I was a bit confused though. What was said to be the ""menu"" looked more like a short novel. It especially felt this way when the waitress instructed us to turn to page 8 for a list of lunch specials (page 8 was about half way through this ""menu""). It was a bit overwhelming at first. After navigating through the menu for about 15 minutes, we finally decided on our orders. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and my parents ordered the Chicken Madeira and the Carlton Salad, respectively. The Chicken Costoletta was lightly breaded, served over a creamy, white sauce and garnished with finely sliced lemon peels. It was accompanied with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Honestly, this may have been the best meal I've had in the year 2013. It was that good. All of the flavors complemented each other very well and the chef prepared the food perfectly. My only regret is that I didn't save room for cheesecake, but luckily I was able to take a piece to go. Given the fact that the place is called ""Cheesecake Factory"" it shouldn't come as a surprise that their cheesecake is really, really good. I ordered the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake and it was one of the best pieces of cheesecake I have ever had (the best cheesecake I ever had was at One Market Restaurant in San Francisco). It was a combination of fudge, chocolate cheesecake and vanilla mouse, and yes, it's as good as it sounds. I am greatly anticipating my next visit to the Cheesecake Factory and I look forward to trying new things from their voluminous menu. I would encourage anyone to go and try one of the many cheesecake flavors they have, in addition to any of the main course options. You can't go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=40
Wanda M.,"Indianapolis, IN",465,716,5598,3.0,4/2/2013,"We had a special event a few weeks ago at this location for 16 of us; many of us had not seen each other for a couple of years which is why we explained and requested the Rotunda.  Our reservations were misunderstood and the service was LESS than desirable but our dinner reviews were 3 to 4 stars and one 5 star from our group.  I will preference this review with the Manager, once aware of seating and vast service issues did everything in his power to correct our unhappiness with the experience. The Manager was phenomenal and handled the situation with grace and we only wish we had made our situation known sooner to him. Apparently we were told our waitress was the best they had...??? Hard to believe!!!   Our Manager comp'd appetizers and desserts for the entire group which helped many of the groups ruffled feathers in the beginning.  However, several will not return due to the numerous issues experienced.   The Managers' effort was greatly appreciated and most did enjoy dinner so another chance could in order.  Even if we had interrupted folks in our booth getting in and out, there wasn't room to stand around the booths socializing with our friends without disturbing the family seated at the center table of the rotunda which we requested with our reservations.  The Managers game plan was to take over their table once they left to allow us space to move around from the 4 booths we were in. However, they stayed for hours, and rightfully so!!!, visiting with friends showing off their new baby which didn't resolve our situation as planned since they left as we were receiving desserts.   Regardless, we felt the evening was a bust!!  Basically, due to being separated into 4 separate, private booths, we only conversed and dined with the 6 friends confined within our booth. Because of this, many people couldn't mingle so hello and goodbye was the extent of their conversations.  Our total evening for dinner, even with the Managers assistant, from beginning to end was 4  1/2 hours!!! All were frustrated from the beginning with our seating arrangements to the length of time it took to correct and pay our bill. 4  1/2 hours is unimaginable for dinner here regardless of the size of the party or the 4 booths to serve. On a positive note, my husband stated his Club sandwich was the best he'd ever had. It was not lunchmeat but instead shaved turkey chunks piled high on his sandwich. The Chicken Carbona, Roma Chicken, Eggplant sandwich and the Steak Diane at our table was enjoyed by our group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=40

We started out with the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, it reminded me of corn bread which I love by the way.  The tamale cake was sweet but the sauce was citrus-y, I thought it went together really well.  We all really enjoyed the tamale cake.  When we got our entrees, I realize the portion was pretty nice but I wouldn't expect anything less with the prices we are paying.  I ordered the Garlic noodle (suggested by a friend) because I love garlic!  As soon as I took a bite, BANG I was hit by a brick of salt.  All I could taste was SALT.  Everybody had a bite of my dish and we all agreed this was inedible.  I sent the dish back and they assured me that they will have a new dish within 10 minutes.  10 minutes passed...20 minutes passed...30 minutes passed... 40 minutes passed and everybody was pretty much done with their meal.  I hate being put in this situation because I felt like our party didn't want to order dessert until my entree came out.  I went ahead and told the waitress to pack my meal to go and we were ready to order dessert. At this point I'm having a pretty crappy lunch but I know the red velvet cheesecake will turn my frown upside down.  Almost half the table was planning to try the red velvet cheesecake as well, thanks to me raving about it throughout lunch.  I couldn't believe what was happening when the waitress let us know that they are out of the red velvet.  AHHHHH!!!  You can say I had a pretty horrible experience at the CF.  At least the manager waived my meal for free since I did not get to eat with my party.  Let's just say this was my first dining experience with them and will also be the very last.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=100

I told the server and I ordered another dish. He did not admit to any nut product, nor did he offer to fix the situation or comp part if our meal. Within 15-20 min I was having an allergic reaction. I began Coughing uncontrollably and I had to leave.My husband was left to box up the food and pay the bill.  The server did not offer anything...... Another waitress, whom my husband had summoned over, seemed concerned but did not rectify the situation.  Fortunately, my reaction was minimal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=80
Sarah T.,"Huntington, WV",29,165,83,3.0,12/10/2012,"I have to agree with other reviews.. giant portions of 'so-so' food. I wasn't amazed, but I did leave full.  I was kind of disappointed with my ahi tuna.. it didn't have much flavor (the ahi tuna salad is one of the few menu items that is not enormous), but everyone else at the table was pretty happy with their food (giant, overflowing plates of cashew chicken.. at a whopping 1810 calories a plate by the way. It should be good- that's all you get to eat that day) The redeeming quality.. the dessert. My group split a strawberry shortcake and a tiramisu.  The shortcake was less spongy than I've had at other restaurants and tasted more like a cookie.. and it wasn't ridiculously sweet. I liked. And the tiramisu.. well. It was Amazing. Loved. Knocked this place up from 2 stars to 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=80
Howard L.,"Park Ridge, IL",54,1064,9128,4.0,6/3/2011,"All Cheesecake Factories are the same across the country, except Hawaii's which has a slightly different menu I'm told.  That's a good thing, as you should always get a good, generously sized meal and a good deal.  Wife had pork chops and I had the cajun shrimp and chicken linguine.  Both were very good selections from their extensive menu.  Our party of 4 also split a chocolate coconut and banana cream cheesecake, with the BC being the better choice.  Festive and vibrant scene, and excellent service.  Nice to have a reliable, nationwide franchise like CF around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=80
Gregg M.,"Dayton, OH",488,989,1104,4.0,12/24/2010,"For the third year running, three friends from the old neighborhood and I have met over the Christmas holiday at the Cheesecake Factory for our annual reunion.  Cheesecake Factory is a known quantity.  There are no surprises with the food.  The food will be tasty and in portions that will be obscenely-large, but reasonably-priced.  The selections on the menu are likely researched and test-marketed with scientific precision for mass appeal and corporate-approved.  The only variables at a Cheesecake Factory are the crowd and the quality of service. This time around, the crowd for lunch on Christmas Eve was sparse.  Service from Nicholas was solid.  However, I did find one surprise with the food.  The Cheesecake Factory has followed the tapas/small-plate trend and added a page to their phonebook-sized menu with small plate selections.  I had the arugula salad, crispy (read fried) artichoke hearts served with a lemon-garlic aioli, and Vietnamese tacos, a banh mi-style taco with a fluffy flour bun/""shell"".  What can I say?  It wasn't bad at all!  Cheesecake Factory delivers yet again!   I'm sure I'll be back same time, next year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=80
Pam P.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,39,293,3.0,7/21/2013,"Came here for lunch with Husband & Relatively spry Mother In Law (age 90, tiny little thing) who has a wheeled walker. They don't appear to have space for walkers to ""park"" while the guest is at a table.  The tables are pretty close to each other thus compounding the problem. I didn't see any ""handicap"" tables on a quick survey inside.  The restaurant was relatively full.  The walker sat next to the table like another chair was added.  The guests at the next table had to shimmy to get by it, the tables are that close. The entrees were great as usual for me & husband.   My MIL ordered off of the ""diet"" menu (SkinnyLicious) since she wanted sandwich and salad but NO soup or bread on the side, and that was the only way to order that combo that we found.  She doesn't eat huge portions to begin with. Her mixed greens salad came without any dressing at all on it (she ordered with extra dressing on the side as she always does). We had a waiter in training.  He was accompanied by his trainer.   It seemed long time before they checked on us to realize no dressing at all had been provided.  The trainer handled it when the trainee didn't seem to believe there was no dressing.  Once they did bring dressing, apparently it was a pretty flavorless vineagrette.   She ate half her chicken salad sandwich, which she said was good (and took half home). I had Pasta Da Vinci, he had Pasta Carbonara.  My MIL liked our pasta better than her items to my judgement. We all 3 had cheesecake for desssert, I had plain w/ strawberry topping.  Flavor is awesome but the cheesecake itself seems ""fluffy"".  I'm used to a denser cheesecake I guess. Hubby got one with lots of ""stuff""  like candy pieces & chocolate etc.  A bit sweet for me but he liked.  MIL got key lime and we all liked it as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=80

Mark V.,"Indianapolis, IN",5,70,98,2.0,1/25/2014,"Well, I had decided for the most part to give up chain restaurants for good.  That is until the company Christmas party.  Guess what?  I won a certificate to Cheesecake Factory, so why not do a review.  Overall, this place is a train wreck, and I have no idea how this place stays in business.  People stop wasting money on garbage like this and find some better places to eat, and save a lot of money in the process.  Just click on my lists of reviews.  I will help you get to better places.   First of all you come in and guys with guns grab your wallet and purse. Take all your cash or charge a huge sum to your credit or debit card.   Ok not literally!   I left there feeling taken advantage of.  Two people could easily spend $60 to $80 and that would be without alcohol.  It was freezing cold so I ordered coffee at $3.00.  Why will people shell out $3.00 for five cent cup of coffee?  I don't understand this is ridiculous to say the least.  (Remember I am working with a gift card and that is the reason I did.  I didn't want any balance left on the card which would force me to come back.)  $2 drinks are crazy, but now places are charging $3 for what a local gas station would charge $.79 for the same thing.   Ordered the pizza at $12 as an appetizer.  It was the best thing I had there but that isn't saying much.  The sausage on the pizza was great.  The mozzarella cheese was fresh and made in house.  However, the crust was limp and doughy and the sauce had no flavor.  I think it was a 10 inch and overpriced in my opinion. Everything was overpriced as I looked through the menu.  I was going to get the fish and chips for $17.00.  I asked the waitress to find out if the fish was fresh or frozen.  The fish is frozen she told me.  $17.00 FROZEN FISH!  I just wanted to get up on my chair and scream to all the customers to get out and start listing all the great local restaurants we have in Indianapolis.  You can charge $17 for fish and chips but you can't use fresh fish. OMG!  I went with the $12 chili rellenos burger.  I am not sure if the burger was fresh or frozen at this point I just wanted to eat and get out of this nightmare.  The burger was nice size but lacked seasoning.  The problem was the chili rellenos on top was a greasy mess and tasted awful.   I have ate really good chili rellenos and this was worst one I have ever had.   You have $1.50 in food cost and charge $12 but you can't even make it good.  I didn't like the fries either and I know those were frozen and came from a bag in the freezer.  No fresh made fries on this $12.00 plate of garbage.      I didn't have the cheesecake on this visit, but I have had it before.  I know people love this, but I think it is just slightly above average and way overpriced at $7-$8 per slice. I have ate much better cheesecake at other restaurants.  Besides, who wants to eat 1000 plus calories for dessert....NOT ME!  Portion size is not an issue as I watched plates come out to the tables, so I can understand a slightly higher price point.  However, mediocre food is still mediocre food regardless of portion size.  This place is for people that have more money than they have common sense.  If you are bored of chain restaurants and think for yourself and are not manipulated by millions of dollars in TV commercials to make yourself believe you have to eat average to below average overpriced food at some chain restaurant, I am one of you.  Let's all keep supporting the true food scene in Indiana.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=80

Greg D.,"Rushville, IN",0,4,,1.0,8/3/2015,"Ok, was excited to try Cheescake Factory for the first time. I can't deny it's role in ""Big Bang Theory"" got me interested. In fact, when my wife and I were having trouble deciding where to go, I said, I got it, follow my directions(she's driving). She gave me a funny, but curious look. So off we go. We get to Greenwood Park Mall and says, ""hmmm, have we been here before. I said no and then she guesses Cheescake Factory, because we have been to the Fridays there a dozen times.   We enter, I'm surprised by the size, especially it's ultra-high ceilings. A hostess is right there, she asks how many and I tell her 2, then ask her ""Is there bar seating?"" She replies yes, I ask if we seat ourselves, she says yes and we head that way.(9 times out of 10 we sit in bar areas at places like this-primary reason-no kids around). My wife usually prefers booths and we found an open one and sat down. A waitress shows up promptly and says with a distressed look on her face, ""Did they seat you here""? I reply, ""No, the hostess said it was self-seating in the bar"". The waitress replies, ""only for those sitting at the bar"". (I never hinted to the hostess I was looking for 2 bar stools at the bar). So I explain, ""Oh, this is my first time hear, I didn't understand that. So then, can we sit here?"" She says, ""I guess, but it needs to be wiped down"" in a fairly unfriendly manner. I said, ""That's fine, it just needs a quick wipe"", joking that the ""last people here were pretty clean"".   So, the confusion thing seemed over with, but we waited at least 5 minutes, when I reached the conclusion that between this ladie's attitude and the wait to get a busboy to come wipe our table, this experience might not even get better. (cue in back of mind-""Big Bang Theory"", the episode where Penny screws with Sheldon about sabotaging his food).   So I decide we're leaving. Well, the cheescake display is in front of us and I decide to order a whole cheescake to go(white-chocalate, rasberry truffle- MMMMMM, very, very rich)and this gives me time to ask for a manager.   Manager arrives, I say, ""I'm choosing to not eat hear for lunch today, would you like to know why?"". He does, so I explained how the confusion of which seats are in the ""bar area"" and which seats are not, which seats are ""seat yourself"" and which seats are not, added to a non-friendly reception from the waitress, made me lose faith in the restaurant. He then explained the design of the place, which area was bar and which areas were not (extremely strange set-up, very undefined, kind-of sectioning the bar area off, but kind-of blending the far side of the bar area into the family side). The protocol of the bar/family-side, who seats who thing, was now finally getting clearer.    So then, this has been a little twilight-zoney already, but the first part was nothing. I asked the mangager, ""So, should I return to this restaurant to give it another chance?"" He said, ""Yes, you should"". I say, ""Why? He looked puzzled, apparently nobody had ever asked him for reasons to dine at the restaurant he is managing. He sure didn't have any reasons at the top of his head and gave he this funny look (the only thing it reminds me of is when my kids were little and I had to take one of their bottles away for a second). So then I express my very real questions about eating at a place where the manager can't give me any good reasons to eat there. He starts getting uptight, says I didn't give him a chance. So I say, ""Ok, try again"" and back up a step and put my arm around my wife in a ""I'm ready to listen"" stance. So, he starts out by asking me a question, rehashing the seating thing. So I answer him, but he doesn't let me finish my answer, interrupting me. I said, ""You asked, let ME finish"". He then says, ""You didn't let me finish, you won't give me a chance"". I say, ""No, Sir, I gave you plenty of chances and you failed miserably"".     This could have been the end of it, expect he walked away mumbling, then turned around, walked past me mumbling something. So, I said, ""You know, I understated it, YOU are a failure...as a manager. My advice to you is that you should find an occupation more suited to your skills"". Before I got that out he muttered something else, which prompted me to wrap it up with the phrase, ""You just plain suck at it (managing)"".    Again, the white chocolate rasberry truffle cheesecake was amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-greenwood?start=80
