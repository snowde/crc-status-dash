The menu is very big, but I like that you can order the lunch special and it really is still a lot of food. Everyone had to take at least half to go.

Molisa T.,"Hanover, MD",0,7,,1.0,7/17/2016,"Terrible phone service. Called twice and nobody EVER picked up. The zecond time I called, I called to let them know I was on hold for an extremely long time, and she placed me on another LONG HOLD! I called to speak to their manager and the person answering keeps clicking the hold option. Terrible customer service! People that want to place orders over the phone should not be penalized! Somebody should always be on phone duty and if it is busy, then turns need to be taken. However, the phone should ALWAYS be managed! ALWAYS! Due to your terrible services, I am taking my business elsewhere, and telling people I know not to visit this location. EVER.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=80

By charred, I mean black! Fourth, my husband ordered the Steak Diane and it came with 4 tiny pieces of steak. Seriously?

Cheesecake was amazing as always, ambiance was typical cheesecake (very good but loud)  Service was the WORST I have EVER had at any Cheesecake Factory... Restaurant was half full on a Monday evening at 8 when we got here... 920 by the time we got to order Cheesecake... The waiter came to the table once for drink orders, when he finally came back with drinks we ordered food... Then we stopped him after we had finished eating to order cheesecake.

Khoi N.,"Silver Spring, MD",241,257,644,5.0,5/8/2016,"I've eaten here many times. This place has always had great service whether your dining for lunch or late in the evenings. You can never go wrong with their cheesecakes. I would recommend if your plan on taking a cake home give yourself 30-60 minutes for them to get it prepared. I came here for lunch the other day. We ordered the Kobe style burger, garlic parmesan bread and the Cajun Jambalaya pasta. The Kobe burger wasn't actually the Kobe beef, but just seasoned with mushrooms and onions. Nothing really special here. Our garlic parmesan bread as an appetizer was delicious. You get the tough crust of the ciabatta bread but the soft interior with the melted cheese and their special seasoning. Delicious I'm not sure why I never ordered it before and why a lot of people don't comment on it. The Jambalaya was amazing. You get large shrimp with tender chicken and plenty of roasted pepper. Its advertised as very spicy but I'd give this a 1/5 on the heat scale. Very large portion and expect a to go bag. If your really hungry and want large portions this is the spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=80

Stan J.,"Henderson, NV",0,58,43,1.0,4/17/2015,1st time visiting here and we are big Cheesecake Factory fans from where we live near Vegas. This one is just not up to standards. The low carb cheesecake with strawberries was embarrassing. Literally ONE strawberry cut into 6 tiny pieces. Waiter went back to the kitchen and staff told him it's supposed to be that way! Manager came over and admitted it was embarrassing and brought some extra berries.

Ishita V.,"Reston, VA",32,113,335,5.0,7/21/2014,"Believe me, I'm the biggest cheesecake lover you can find lol. I always always have either the red velvet cheesecake or the original one. They are my favorites! I get scared to try anything new lol. But I tried the mango key lime cheesecake today.  And I wasn't satisfied :( it firstly has the coconut macaroon crust which I don't prefer. Graham cracker is the best you can have in cheesecake. Secondly the mixture of lime and mango didn't go well with me. It isn't that bad but it's not great either!  My friends called for Kahlua coffee and the lemon and raspberry one. If you like coffee in desserts you'll love the Kahlua one. I personally don't prefer coffee in my desserts so that's not for me! Lemon and raspberry was good, but too lemony for my tongue. Original and red velvet for the win!  But of course I love Cheesecake Factory :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=80

Took 10 minutes for someone to bring a high chair to our table and another 5 minutes for our waitress to come to the table just to take our drink order. It was a really slow time, 4:45 the Tuesday before thanksgiving for dinner. Kitchen was horribly slow as well. Our waitress was super nice and friendly but management here needs to figure out how to improve on a lot of areas. Considering its newer and next to casino, I was horribly disappointed.

Not only did the lady who brought our food not remove these dishes, but our server didn't remove them either. Even when we asked her to do so.  The Cuban egg rolls were good.

I ordered the shrimp basket and had mashed potatoes vs fries because I adore their mashed potatoes. The shrimp and the cole slaw were both good and filling.  Had enough food for two meals.  My mom got the shrimp scampi with fettuccini noodles instead of the linguine and my gma got the turkey club.  Both liked their dishes.  For dessert we all got the same cheesecake but can't recall which one (this is what happens when you take too long to write a review) but it was delish.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=40

Peter V.,"Hedgesville, WV",0,11,2,1.0,10/22/2017,Very average food and poor service. If that is what you are looking for you have found your place. Every time we go they tell us that they are making fresh bread and make us wait. When the bread comes it is always cool. I think they lie to save bread and to encourage you to buy more expensive appetizers. If you don't want to give us bread just don't offer bread you cheap jerks. Half the times we have eaten here our meals have come out at different times. Nothing worse than eating alone.

Love the location adjacent to MD Live and depending where you're seated you might get a view of the slots and perhaps a winner or two. Vast menu including ""skinny options"" but wait...who want SKINNY at The Cheesecake Factory?! Mmmmm...nah. Had my favorite Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and Cosmo. My date had the amazing special. salmon in a lemon caper sauce with mushrooms with mashed potatoes and broccoli ($19.99). Ahhhhh-ma- ZING. Salmon was perfect,  flaked easy and not a lot of sauce. We opted to nix the cheese cake because chicken sliders AND avocado egg rolls ( packed with red onion and whoa...) are enough to shut down the city.  Top that with the fantastic service. ..Shout out to Nicole. The Fat lady sings, no cake required!  The Cheesecake Factory chains are great and seldom disappoint.

S C.,"Waldorf, MD",0,1,1,2.0,1/13/2017,"Was there Thursday afternoon. Food was very disappointing, service and manager are excellent. The only good thing about food was the wheat bread and cheesecake flavor.  We had crab bites as an app, it was okay. My husband ordered a prime rib steak, medium rare. Came out very well done. My husband mentioned it to our server and the manager came by. They did offer to replace it but we were so hungry to wait again. Manager offered a free dessert. Which was very nice.I ordered Thai salmon, it was ehhhh. It's sweet and spicy, but after a few bites the sweetness kills all the flavor. I even told my husband maybe savory food is not their forte, since they are known for cheesecake. We ordered hazelnut cheesecake.

Correction, the whole table got their food first except for their young daughter.  One of the other waitstaff in the restaurant got mad at her table and was cussing at the machine behind our booth.

John S.,"Hanover, MD",4,17,,2.0,9/2/2016,"Returned again for my fathers recent birthday.  Large portions, but the food seems to be lacking flavor all over.  I had the steak tacos because the description sounded great.  Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to the hype:  there was very little steak in the steak tacos. What steak there was, was way over cooked and hard. The tacos had no traditional Mexican flavor at all. There was also this weird crema on them. The plate was complemented with a heavy helping of flavorless Mexican rice, and black beans.  The black beans were the best part of the dish and I would only give them a 3/5.. The other members of our party generally liked their food. The Vietnamese  Summer Rolls had good taste but seems a little dry, and dry, like they  were prepared earlier (days?) and then served.  All,in all, I cringe when my family want o go here.  I'm batting zero out of three or four visits.  I think the Cheese Cake factory may have grown too job fast, or its just this location.  Why is it that the retardants at the casino are mostly fast food and not great food like you get in Vegas.  The casino seems li,e a step down from Vegas for sure, especially the food options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=40

It almost broke my tooth it was so hard! She took it back to get me a new order-- but then informed me that they keep their ahi in the freezer and that all the ahi was still frozen so I'd have to pick another entree.

Neil S.,"Reisterstown, MD",34,102,14,1.0,1/11/2017,"Ten minute wait for a table is okay considering it was a Saturday night. When our buzzer went off the hostess nonchalantly told us to wait until our name was called. A two part seating system, whatever.  The table was a small booth next to louvered windows facing the slot  machines in the casino. The combination of a tight booth, loud casino noise and the view from my table of casino customers spitting on the casino carpet was more than I could stand. The food was really bad. The portions were not prepared correctly. The pasta and chicken dish I ordered was severely lacking chicken and the sauce was overpowering and salty. My wife ordered a steak that was dry and over cooked. The boys entrees were disappointing as well. The waiter while not overly friendly, was highly efficient.

However, the service is almost always poor. It often takes 15-20 minutes to get a drink after sitting down. I won't even go into how hard it is to get a refill. Having more than 1 basket of bread is apparently a burden. We always ask for another and sometimes never receive one after asking multiple times.

The service is slow.  Our server was seen many times around the restaurant but it was really difficult to get him to come by our table.   One of the entrees we ordered was the falafel salad and it was very disappointing.   The falafel was dry and there were not enough toppings on the salad for the amount of greens.  We were hoping to signal our server so we could exchange it for something else, but I ended up just sharing my sisters dish.  By the time he came over, we did not want to wait for another to entree to be prepared.   Dessert was another disappointment. We wanted to order a slice of cheesecake. We told the server we needed a minute to decide.  He never came back. Again, we saw him but not by our table.  By the time he came we just asked for the check.  He never apologized for the delay.  We even did a playful ""We thought you forgot about us!"" - no response.

Chastity W.,"Glenarden, MD",31,38,18,2.0,8/21/2015,"I normally wouldn't review a chain restaurant, but I decided to make an exception. Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants to dine at and I'd say I eat at Cheesecake Factory at least twice a month. With that said, I consider myself to be well-versed in all things Cheesecake Factory. This location in particular leaves much to be desired each time I dine here. Each time it's either the food, the drinks, or both that fail to live up to the standards set forth by other (better) Cheesecake Factories. For instance today I came in for an appetizer and cocktail before doing some shopping. I sat at the bar because I didn't feel like waiting for a table when it was just me. I ordered the Tex Mex egg rolls and White Sangria. Both being some of my favorites. First, my drink came and I thought it was interesting that the bartender poured it from pitcher of pre-made sangria and used a spoon to scoop out some of the fruit from the same pitcher and place that in my glass for what in assuming was supposed to be 'garnish'. Not impressed. The drink was more like a thick, syrupy juice and when the egg rolls came out, they weren't any better. The egg rolls were a bit greasy, filled with what seemed like chicken and onions only. I didn't taste any of the corn, black beans, or any of the other stuff that's normally in there. The avocado ranch dipping sauce was very watery and tasteless.  The service here was ok. This is pretty typical for this CF. I'm not hard to please but it always bothers me when wait staff and bartenders lack personality. I won't say that I won't be back here because the reason I come back is because it's convenient, but I do hope this review and the others reach it to someone in management who could possibly work on this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=120
Carolyn C.,"Baltimore, MD",342,293,974,5.0,6/22/2015,"There is usually so much hatred towards a chain restaurant; however, The Cheesecake factory is a chain restaurant that I adore. The only way you can go wrong here is if you don't order more than one dish. The menu is extensive and can be over whelming but when it comes to food, overwhelming is great.  I like this location because I can run in and out super-fast, get my shopping on either before or after, never have to fight for parking because the casino parking is always open and I leave happy and full knowing that I made healthy decision eating here rather than in the food court (ew). Side note for the drinks...they can be SO expensive but they are SO GOOD. Blueberry mojitos are the best. They make me so happy I can cry. *Ask for Tiffany if you want a wonderful little burst of energy as a server, she's adorable and happens to be a great friend of mine.

Kevin M.,"Baltimore, MD",163,288,68,3.0,6/18/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory it is always my ""go to"" restaurant. I recently learned about the happy hour, which is amazing. An entire delegate menu is given with many choices from drinks to appetizers for only 5.50 each!  I've so far enjoyed all the drinks offered. The jw's pink lemonade is my favorite not to sweet or overly loaded with alcohol. It's delicious and gets the job done. But all the drinks are good the margarita is refreshing and the Long Island is on point.  My boyfriend ordered the factory nachos and buffalo blasts. Even though they are very generic bar food they were very good for 5.50 each.., Finally the cheesecake is amazing I mean you can't go wrong with any of the selections. I had the Reese's peanut butter cup cake cheesecake. It's huge and was absolutely delicious for this peanut butter lover. The service is a different story.... Normally I sit at the bar and have the same bartender a very nice light skinned overly energetic woman. Absolutely love her! Now no joke, every other time I have a different server or bartender it leaves me wanting more... You can tell a lot of the staff does not follow the cheesecake dining experience that they are taught during training. The servers tend to be over whelmed and running around. I do think the management needs some tweaking to make service better. I remember when they first opened and for the first few years they were definitely on point. I hope they can get back to that perfect 5 level!  I will always return",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=120

I've never had issues with the food at any other location but this one at Arundel Mills really needs to re-evaluate who's working in the kitchen. Some days they do just fine, others it's pretty bad.

I've had good food both times we've been here, but the service was mixed. Awesome the first time, meh the second. Same with the tables. Nice and quiet the first time (on the outside wall by the windows), ridiculously loud the second (next to the casino floor).  Standard cheesecake factory menu, so no surprises there. They have a bit of everything. I like to get an entree from their skinnylicious menu so I don't feel so bad about getting cheesecake later. The soft tacos with spicy shrimp are very tasty, and the tuscan chicken is good too. The cheesecake is always good.

Tim H.,"Silver Spring, MD",151,419,187,4.0,4/19/2013,"I have been to this restaurant a few times at various locations but more recently, I have been to this location the most in the past two years due to the fact that it is located near my job. The size of this place seems pretty large and due to it being fairly new everything looks nice and clean. The bar is kid of small compared to others I've seen but it seems to do its job without any problems. I am sure most people come here for the great cheese cakes that this place offers and is probably best known for but for me I come for the tasty appetizers and entrées that this place has to offer.  The appetizers are big enough to be a meal in itself but if you are in the mood to do some serious eating, then get an appetizer and an entrée. You will most likely feel really stuffed after wards but it is well worth it. I have tried their pasta dishes, several in fact. I normally get the lunch size portion since it is very filling. I like to eat and I can eat a lot but between an appetizer and a lunch size pasta dish, I get full easily. The menu here is full of great choices. Even though I stick to the pastas most of the time, I do like their salads and sandwiches. All their items are large and filling despite being called Skinny or lunch portion.  If you like good food served in large portions for a reasonable price, give this place a try. If you are a regular here, try something different. I've tried several things over the past few months and everything I've had I've enjoyed. Thanks for reading my review. This review is based off of my personal opinion and experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=160

We spoke to the manager, who could give us no explanation and once we did get seated he never came back to check on our table or our experience.

As soon as we were seated, we found at least two pieces of silverware that had crusted food on them.  We had a very polite and friendly young lady waiting on us; she apologized and brought clean replacements right away. We had trouble deciding what to order so our server gave us extra time and brought our drinks.  We were also given a bread basket of two types of warm, tasty bread but not until very close to when our meals came.  I would have liked it much sooner, in order to nibble while waiting for our meals. My friend had strawberry waffles and I had the steak tacos.  Both were very good, nice portions, except the cilantro rice on my steak taco plate was not full cooked.  The rice was very crunchy and dry.   We passed on dessert.  I know in a metropolitan area like this and attached to a big casino the prices will be higher but $8 for a piece of cake seemed crazy to us.  Overall it was an ok meal but I am not sure we will hurry back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=160

Well, the burger was charred to a crisp and the bacon was so well done it was inedible. The app samosas were good...great curry chicken mixture but for 4 small triangles not worth it. I also ended with Linda's chocolate cake. Now, I know the public has said the portions were huge but at least I could snack on it for days. Well they got the message and cut back.

I had even lower expectations with it being sat night (8/12) at almost 11pm. We walked in to a group asking how much longer because they were given incorrect expectations to start. 4 people stood behind the counter. One was a sever the other a hostess. Another hostess and what looked like a manager (female Caucasian) addressing the concern of the group in front of us. We stood there for a solid 10 minutes with no one acknowledging us. After the group left, the employees started to talk very rude about the customers that just left. None of them looked at us and we were standing right in front of them. Another couple walked in and asked if we were waiting.. after standing for a minute we decided to leave. I've been to several Cheesecakes and have never had this type of experience.

Their meals we're awesome and both we're pleased me on the other hand not so much. First had a little wait time for our seats which was fine because it was packed. What didn't make sense is to ring our buzzer and have us wait at the hostess counter for an additional 10-15 mins while other guests are being buzzed after us and seated. Finally seated and was given waters & bread. I started to drink from my water when I spotted something green floating in the water. Looked like chopped spinach/lettuce/garnish whatever is green. Either way I was grossed out def wanted to leave but my fince convinced me stay so I did but was very paranoid after. I asked for another water ordered bang bang chicken and Arnold Palmer. Recieved my order pretty fast water didn't touch it kept thinking there was a piece of residue food floating around in it. Bang Bang chicken looked ok sauce was a little crusty had that film over it like when you leave gravy out to long uncovered and has that film over the top. I had the brown rice which was under cooked still mushy and clumpy so just ate the chicken. The ""Arnold Palmer"" was the worst how they managed to have the (unsweetened)iced tea sit at the bottom and lemonade on top is beyond me. It was like oil and water it wouldn't mix lol. I was already done at the dirty cup so the meal and drink was icing on the cake. NOPE!  here's a cherry in form of a strawberry shortcake I ordered. Should've known with a place named cheesecake factory why order anything else. We'll I did and regretted it. Took mines to go because I was ready to go. I should've left it.

Layaka N.,"Fort Meade, MD",31,2,,1.0,6/22/2016,"This past Saturday, June 18, I went to have a late dinner with a friend around 10:30pm.  We were seated in the rear of the restaurant and the walk to our table was almost as tedious as walking a tightrope, I imagine.  The floor had a greasy sheen and I was nervous that each step was going to end in an embarrassing fall.  We made it to our seats and ordered two appetizers, two cocktails and a beer... all of which were fine.   After paying for dinner, I decided to carefully 'ice skate' my way to the restroom prior to leaving.  This is where things became the stuff of nightmares! I entered the empty restroom and opened the door to the first stall and immediately almost hurled at the sight! The toilet was full to the brim with bloody toilet paper and a tampon.  There was also used tampon on the floor in what appeared to be urine. The seat had blood all over it. I quickly moved to the next stall and to my surprise it was more sickening!  There was vomit all over the floor and toilet seat.  The toilet was filled with vomit!  I actually panicked because I'd left my inhaler at the table and the sigh of all of this caused me to lose my breath as if I was having asthma attack.  I immediately left the restroom and grabbed the first employee that I saw and described the whole horrible scene in the restroom.  I asked him to notify a manager immediately.  Then I attempted to make my way to the table so that I could get a couple of puffs off my inhaler.   However,  I forgot that the floor was as slippery as the lanes at a bowling alley and I nearly lost my footing trying to get back to the table.  I turn and ask the manager if there was something spilled on the floor and to my surprise he casually stated, ""They are always like this"".  Then he asked whether or not I had fallen and I said, ""not yet"".  He said, ""good"".  I cautiously glided back to my date and we immediately walk the tightrope to the exit.  Thankfully, we made it out...alive! I actually have to say that I didn't think this was typical of the Cheesecake Factory 'experience', but I have to say that I think this particular location has a few issues. After sharing my story with my daughter, she told me that she slipped, but did not fall at this same location, two weeks ago.  She stated that her friend had gone to the ladies restroom and one stall was 'disgusting' and thev other was out of toilet paper.  Recounting the story to co-workers about this location and heard at least a couple similar stories about the restroom or greasy floors.   The manager's lackadaisical attitude was annoying.  Had I entered that restroom and witnessed the horror prior to eating,  I would've immediately left!  Instead I had to deal with almost unbearable nausea after dinner whenever I pictured the disgusting scene :(  So disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=60

Cheesecake is usually a safe bet, as I've been to the locations in Chicago on several occasions. We started with orders of the buffalo blasts, cheese sticks, and chicken pot stickers.

If you're expecting typical Cheesecake Factory service, this is not the place. Since we were in the area to shop and my friend and I had free vouchers for cheesecake slices, we decided to stop by here for dinner. It was in the middle of the week, so nearly all of the available seating was vacant. When we approached the hostess desk, she never greeted us or looked up from whatever she was doing. She took down a name and told us that someone will be with us shortly. 10-15 minutes later, our server came over to seat us. We commented that we had to wait to be seated, even though the restaurant was nearly empty. Our server was confused, saying that there shouldn't have been a wait at all, and that the hostess should've seated everyone right away instead of making everyone wait. She apologized and took down our orders since we were ready and hungry. Everything after that was uneventful.

I apologize that I can't remember his name but he earned a respectable tip for his service. I chose the calamari for my lunch and it was piping hot when it came to the table. I enjoyed the marinara sauce but the white dipping sauce...not so much. Cooked just right and not chewy the amount for the appetizer was enough to share. For my dessert to go I went with the chocolate turtle cheesecake. At first glance; I was like dang, these slices are getting smaller with each visit. It actually turned out to be more than enough and I actually shared some with my favorite carnivore. The menu at Cheesecake Factory is so vast that you'll need a good 15 minutes to decide what you'd like.

The cocktails were refreshing and beautifully garnished. The calamari was perfectly tender and seasoned.  For dinner, we had a duo of ribeyes. His came with a velvety macaroni and cheese side and mine came with the normal fresh fries. There is an up-charge for changing sides, but no big deal. Lastly, for dessert, my husband had the pineapple upside-down cheese cake and I had the dulce de leche cheese cake, both to-go.

Chanhong L.,"Charlottesville, VA",57,196,15,5.0,2/17/2016,"Note: this review is for The Cheesecake Factory's veggie burger only. Although I will note that this particular Cheesecake Factory was super busy last Saturday night for some reason unbeknownst to me: the wait for a table was up to 6 hours! Needless to say, we got carryout. Anyways, as a vegan, I was super excited (and surprised) to find the veggie burger on the menu, one of the only vegetarian items on the menu not labeled as a salad. I got it without the cheese and mayo, and it was still super tasty thanks in large part to the toasted bun. Apparently, The Cheesecake Factory is known for their bread i.e. I also tried some of their side bread, and it was delicious. The burger also came with a side of fries, which is always a big plus for any fry-lover.

Eric L.,"Elkridge, MD",9,240,5,2.0,2/25/2015,"I can sum this up in a few words...lack of attention to detail. We arrived and the hostess told us the wait was 20 minutes for a party of 4. It took 40 minutes (give or take a minute) for us to be seated. Our waiter was attentive and took our drink and appetizer order promptly. We ordered the factory nachos. They came out about 15 minutes later, however they nacho chips were quite greasy with quite a bit of oil built up at the bottom of the plate.  Our meals eventually arrived and that's when the experience continued to go downhill. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my wife the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with white rice. My pasta had virtually no sauce and was simply hot pepper on pasta (maybe its supposed to be this way, it looked like the picture on their website - I ate a few bites and decided to take the rest home where I could doctor it up with more sauce.) The server did not offer any grated cheese. My wife's dish came out with brown rice. My son's pasta didn't come out until about 5 minutes after ours. When our waiter came over about 5 minutes after that, my wife asked for brown rice. He asked if I wanted grated cheese and I said yes please. He was shocked the server didn't offer it. He then took my wife's dish back and it came out 'replated' (their term) a few minutes later and by then her food was luke warm.  It was a busy night, but if you spend $70 and up to take out a family of four, you shouldn't be walking out of the place complaining about the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=100

I've eaten at this location many time, but this is my first time for brunch. The service is ALWAYS mediocre.  Drinks take forever, the waitresses tend to not know the menu, and in this particular instance, she took our orders and never came back. Someone else brought our appetizers (before we got our drinks ) when I mentioned to that person that the appetizers beat the drinks, she went and got our drinks (I'm sure she worked in the kitchen ). Our food then came out by the same person. Meanwhile I'm wondering, can I tip HER instead?!?  Then our waitress finally brings us bread and disappeared again, never asked how our appetizer or food was. Once we were done with our food pretty much, she asks us do we need another drink, comes back and asks if we ever got oir appetizer. Seriously?!?  The fried zucchini was pretty good ,the chicken and waffles is like a baby portion of waffles, so my husband ended up ordering a second meal and we had to ask for condiments, including syrup. I don't eat pork so I didn't have many options for breakfast meat either because everything came with Bacon or ham. I'd rather eat ihop for breakfast.

The salad was literally two tomato slices with greens straight out of the bag, not very impressive. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing was good. Pasta was greasy and not very good. Green tea was regular ice tea with mint essence, it wasn't even green as usual. I don't know what was going on in the kitchen that day but there sure weren't any standards used on cooking.

Jae M.,"Washington, DC",52,207,51,3.0,12/3/2015,"Typical Cheesecake factory. It is attached to the Maryland Live casino. It does have an entrance that is not attached to the casino so that those under 18 can dine. I went on a Saturday night around 730p with one other person. We were told that it would be approximately a 15-20 min wait. After about 25 min, we were told that it would be another 15 min. At that point, I was annoyed. One of my pet peeves of restaurants is when they can't give adequate quotes for wait times. I think they often (Cheesecake in particular) will tell you less time and then add on because they know that you are already committed and will likely just continue to wait. I can understand if we were a larger party, but it seems silly if you can't adequately estimate turnover for a 2 top table.  Overall, food and service was good. Food wait time was probably about 20-25 min total for appetizers and entrees. Probably wouldn't return again if there is a wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=100

Dean F.,"Laurel, MD",0,16,4,2.0,5/17/2015,"I really looked forward to coming here for the first time. Unfortunately I was mostly disappointed. Wait was 45 mins..I figured it's Saturday night in the casino..of course. So ok. We got seated one thing I didn't like that much was how close other people are to you. Such close proximity you can hear each other even if you whisper. A lot of people don't mind I like privacy at least to some degree. Waiter came and dropped off bread and took drink order promptly.  Started off with a long island ice tea. Friend got a Guinness. Drinks came in a good amount of time.  My drink a was lame, no strength, mostly ice.  Friends was bottled so is what it is. Ordered the chicken sliders asked for the mayo on the side. No tomatoes, pickles on the side. They came out with everything on the side, even the chicken..... Friend got the tex mex eggrolls. They were good. Both took a little too long to come out. I ordered a angry orchard as it's bottles and they can't screw it up. It took so long to come out I almost said take it back I'm not interested anymore. Ordered our entrees in got chicken Alfredo. Wife got shepards pie and friend got steak. Again took quite a long time to come out . Had ordered another beer that took even longer this time. The food was all delicious I must say. I have no complaints there . Ordered cheesecake to go. Atebat home later and it was delicious too. So in summary. The cheesecake factory has great food. It is pricy but you get a lot of a good amount of food so its okay. The service is what gets 2 stars . The waiter Jennifer was awful . She had this attitude on her face like she didn't want to be there. She was slow. I know she was busy butni have been to busier places with 10x faster waiters. So its no excuse. Won't go back this location. May give the Annapolis one a try in the future.

Toya B.,"Odenton, MD",70,8,1,1.0,9/20/2015,"I've been to this location and never had a problem until last night but it's enough to encourage me to another location.  I was there to celebrate my friend getting married along with the other bridesmaids so it was a special occasion. It didn't take long to get get seated or to get drinks. Food came out quick and hot but  the guacamole that came with my quesadillas wasn't fresh at all and the chicken marsala that someone else ordered had too much oil and barely any gravy. We worked down our meals because we were starving we literally just left our dress fittings.

Instead of paying attention to how many people were at the table matching up with our individual bill folds from us paying separately he came back to me twice asking me for my method of payment in which I already gave him along with the rest of the table. All while trying to ring out another table of 3 people before finishing us completely off. He looked himself for almost 30 minutes before I even saw a manager come to our table. Finally the manager came and we explained what happened and the manager helped him look for another 35 minutes just to come back and say ""Sorry we really looked but we still can't find your debit card but we'll comp dinner for the whole table "". EXCUSE ME? ! I appreciate that he at least did that but you still managed to lose my debit card!  I was so furious!  I have to call and cancel my debit in the restaurant because I was blocked in the booth we were eating in because the restaurant is attached to the casino and I didn't want my card being used being they couldn't find it.

Calvin Y.,"Baltimore, MD",24,77,,2.0,3/11/2013,"Since my girlfriend and I had a gift card, and we had just finished shopping at the nearby mall, we thought we would have a bite at the Cheesecake Factory across the mall at the casino. I have eaten at several other Cheesecake Factory locations nearby, and am very familiar with the way these chains are run. While I usually enjoy my visits to Cheesecake Factory, this visit proved to be not only unpleasurable for the both of us, but also seriously made me reconsider the overall quality and standards of this chain altogether. Things were amiss from even before we were seated, as we were given a broken pager.  We were seated in a small table that was accommodating in size, but not in its proximity to the surrounding tables.  While I understand that this is an extremely popular restaurant, I did think it was slightly strange that the tables on either side of us were placed less than a foot away from ours.  I am by no means a claustrophobe, but seating felt pretty cramped and slightly uncomfortable. I'm not exactly sure how servers at Cheesecake Factory work together in terms of sharing tables, but I do recall being helped by three servers total, and regardless of whether taking care of one table is an individual or a collaborative effort between servers, I felt that the overall service left much to be desired, while my girlfriend was positively furious regarding the service that we were given during our visit. Our server seemed to be decently helpful, at least when she was around.  While I did appreciate how she explained to my girlfriend what exactly their polenta fries were like, she was hardly around for the duration of the meal.  It took her roughly ten minutes for her to take our order, which isn't bad, unless you count in the fact that it took an additional ten more minutes for our water to come, which we had ordered ten minutes before our order was taken, making it a grand total of sitting twenty minutes at the restaurant with nothing to eat nor to drink.  We had to flag down another server for straws and lemons for our water, of which only the straws were given to us.  The lemons never came. Our order consisted of one order of the skinny turkey and avocado sandwich with fries substituted for the salad, and an order of the chicken and shrimp jambalaya, which took 40 minutes to come out after we completed our order.  I understand that this sometimes can happen at restaurants, but  there were at least two free tables in our seating zone alone and the restaurant did not appear to be busy. We were neither offered an apology nor an explanation as to why our food had been so slow to come out.  In the meantime, we had ordered a second serving of bread to stave off our hunger, which is usually very soft and tastes very good. This time, though, the bread was not only cold, but hard. By the time our food had come, we had almost  satisfied our appetites from the bread alone.  This was roughly fifty minutes, almost an entire hour, since we were initially seated. The food was hot, which I was grateful for, but when my girlfriend immediately noticed that she needed ketchup for her fries and voiced her request for ketchup, the server was nowhere to be found. This usually wouldn't be a problem, but the fries were neither seasoned and actually tasted inferior in quality to fries that are available at fast food places. The quality of the food was a little less than what I have come to expect from this restaurant chain; the chicken and shrimp tasted bland, as if they were plainly cooked and the jambalaya sauce was tossed on top of it when finished as an afterthought, and several times I bit into the jambalaya and felt and heard a crunch, and really couldn't figure out what on my plate should be making such a sound when biting into it. It felt a lot like undercooked rice. By the end of our meal, my girlfriend was so put off by the restaurant that she opted to skip out on cheesecake for dessert, a decision that is quite unusual given that she had specifically ordered from the skinny menu so that she COULD have a cheesecake for dessert.  When we asked for the check initially, our server was unable to produce it, and said she would go and find it for us. Overall, I was pretty disappointed with the way our visit ended up, as it came up way below what I came to expect.  I'm usually not a hard person to please, and typically if any one or two of these things were to happen on separate occasions, I wouldn't have really cared too much.  However, since they all seemed to happen in combination at once, it seemed that what could have been a simple mistake or mishap appeared to be more like a series of unfortunate points which resulted in sub-par service.  Even though there was still a balance on our gift card, she seemed to be quite adamant about never returning to eat at the restaurant again.  I'm not sure if I could personally recommend this Cheesecake Factory if most customers end up having this sort of experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=200

M C.,"Clinton, MD",0,3,,2.0,8/9/2012,"I don't eat at the Cheesecake Factory very often, given that I live deep down in the wastelands of southern PG County, and the price of gasoline is comparable to the cost of a down payment on a small townhouse. Yet I have always had good, if not stellar experiences at each of the locations that I've been to. Until now. I did not deduct any points for the wait. It was a Saturday night, and this location is inside of the new Maryland Live Casino. I actually found an hour wait for two people to be pretty reasonable, given the circumstances. The ambiance and decor is the same as every other Cheesecake Factory, although a bit smaller. The waitress was very attentive and polite, which was great. The same could not be said for one of her colleagues, who while turning to service the table next to ours bent over and put his ass directly in my face. It was so close I had half a mind to bite it, but I imagine my date might've had a problem with that. Interesting view aside, my only complaint with this particular Cheesecake Factory is the only thing that a restaurant should be concerned about. The food was, for lack of a better word, gross.  I ordered the herb crusted salmon, given that salmon is one of those things that is fairly difficult to really screw up. ""That's what you think, lady,"" said the chef, as he proceeded to really screw up my salmon. Basically, it was blander than a Lifetime Original Movie. The asparagus was built Ford tough, which while desirable in pickup trucks is not so desirable in vegetables. And the potatoes were just glad to be there. They were neither part of the problem, nor part of the solution.  I don't remember what my date ordered, but I believe it was some sort of chicken mushroom pasta thing, that vaguely resembled a small sea monster. He was not overly impressed with the taste. Needless to say, neither of us finished our meals. He threw his out, and I took mine home and cooked it the right way.  I'm willing to chalk this little mishap up to growing pains, as this location is still fairly new. Hopefully the chefs will get better, if not I'll have to start carrying around some sort of seasoning utility belt like the world's lamest Catwoman impersonator.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=200

Next the server also mumbled and then told my husband they had no Sam Adams on tap. When he walks away my husband can see the Sam Adams tap right there at the bar, and confirms with the bar tender thy have Sam Adams. Then order our food (server again mumbling and had to repeat). Server comes back and says ""oh we don't have that"". Manager comes back and says we have that but not one of the sides. We talk it out and asparagus would be subbed. Food comes, no cheese on my husbands cheeseburger and no asparagus. Track down the server who eventually brings a cup of shredded cheese and says that is all they have, still no asparagus and then disappears. Finally track him down and I ask for a manager who comes over and gave lip service. Another 10 minutes the asparagus shows up when we are done eating.

For some reason I'm not sure why nowadays the workers wait for you to greet them. After being seating in a corner I noticed the table was not even wiped down. Crumbs were all over it. So we moved a table over . Ten minutes had passed and no one came to greet us. We asked the bartender if we could please get some service and he said yeah . Still nothing.

Cherie J.,"Washington, DC",59,70,18,3.0,4/7/2013,"Came here to celebrate my 21st bday and we (the fam) had a great time. I should warn you (even though i shouldn't because this is common sense) the wait on friday nights can be up to an hour long. I wasnt bothered because an hour in a casino can go by fast like a thief in a jewelry store. By the time i had played 10$ worth on the quarter slots plus a trip to the bathroom it was time for us to eat. The very first thing that i said walking in was ""where are the lights""? like seriously....this isn't a nightclub. I'm not too sure why most CF's have the lights dimmed so low but they need to fix that because i would like to see my food. To start i had the dynamite shrimp that weren't very dynamite...just mite. they claimed it was supposed to be very spicy but a toddler could eat one and be fine..the sauce was also lack luster. To drink i ordered a strawberry margarita and it was good...what would've made it better was a bit more sugar and a bit more alch por favor! As an entree i wanted to try something new and i really wish i didn't...i had the cajun jumbalaya with chicken and shrimp over rice...it was just so meh..i had a firm grip on my hot sauce bottle the entire time while eating it. And for dessert i ordered the tuxedo cheesecake...OMG...THIS CHANGED MY LIFE LOL...its my new favorite...it was so good that as i started eating it, my mom asked for a bite but decided to get the money ready for the check..BIG MISTAKE MOM! lol because it was gone!. all in all the waitress, nicole, was so nice and patient.

I relocatd from philadelphia and frequented the King of Prussia and South Jersey locations. Once again I found that the food tasted horrible in comparison and the service sucked. I understand that this location is located in the casino but thats no excuse to  prepare subpar food. My dinner was no where near what I expected (I've had the dish at other locations several times) and I had to wait 20 minutes for another dish to be prepared while my guests ate, only to find when I got my dish the pasta was hard (either over or under cooked) at this point I wanted to leave because I was yet again disappointed and did not have the patience to wait another 20 minutes for them to get it right. The waiter seemed unavailable and Ive never got out of my seat and darn near yelled to get a waiters attention as much as I did that night. Given this is my second bad experience I felt the need to write these comments and I will also share my review on yelp.

The service was excellent. Servers name was Kiana - she wanted a good tip and she knew how to get it! I was disappointed with the food. I had the pizza and mac n cheese. I've made both better at home. The mac n cheese was lacking flavor and extremely oily. And the only flavor on the pizza was the pepperonis. Quite a shame really to spend almost an hour waiting to be seated (saturday around 5pm - seated at 6) only to have the best part of it be the $4 strawberry lemonade. BTW the mac n cheese was a side dish and at $6.95 seriously overpriced - both for the size and lack of flavor! If you are looking for a good meal I suggest trying something other than the two dishes I've mentioned here.

Jillian A.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,1,,1.0,8/27/2012,"OOk I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in both Annapolis, and Columbia many times.. and have never received anything but quality service, and decadent food..but now I have visited the Cheesecake Factory in Arundel Mills@MD Live! Casino 2x and both experiences were horrible, the 1st visit was on July 4th,my husband and I had been in the casino and thought we would check it out, we walked in, and were seated immediately..but then we get to the table, our waiter took our drink order..we waited abt 10mins,he came back and told us the bar was ""a little backed up""?..mind you we only ordrd 2 glasses of Sangria, long story short,he takes our order for the food..promises again he would be RIGHT back..well we waited for another 20mins..he was nowhere in sight..all of a sudden he and a waitress bring the food out..we got our food b4 our drinks?!! Were nvr offered any water..bread..nothing! The food was ok,but did not make up for the slow..just neglectful   even aft this negative experience, we just wrote it off as growing pains..waiter may have been new..whatever.  Now our 2nd visit was just this past Thurs night when My husband,sister and myself took our Mom out for her Bday..I'll try to sum up the series of horrible events we witnessed. We walked in, and were welcomed by the   sister did mention my moms Bday,and we were completely ignored..got to the table our waitress Erica,came over..took our drink order..we wait over 15mins..she comes to the table and apologized for the wait, returns abt 5mins later..with only 2 of our drinks..stood there and asked ""ok..everything ok here?"" Hmm..my husband and I would like a drink..with no remorce,she walked away..a bartender returned with our drinks, the drinks that did come were also from the bar..so not sure why only 2 came out..somewhere in all of that we order our food..when my husband ordered his food, their 'bang bang shrimp' she told him..its very ""coconutty""??..without him even asking anything abt it..long story short we wait ANOTHER 20mins for the food..and see her other tables also looking to see where she was as well, we look over and can see out the window right@the booth that were sitting at..outside she is standing at some guys car..and they're literally making out!! As if she is not even at work..she has no one waiting..nothing.At this point we were just disgusted..FINALLY after she dry humps her BF she decides to walk back in..brings food out with another waiter, again food wasn't bad, but we were all just ready to leave..no desert..no singing for our Moms Bday,which she could've cared less at that point anyway. We finished and left a $3 tip..and that was honestly too much.Now when we asked for the MGR we were told he would be right out..hmm how long do u think we had to wait for that??..We were all just irritated even more so now, and had to just get out of there. My sister called the next day..did say the actual Mgr seemed embarrassed and apologized. Supposedly sending a gift certificate..I usually am not a tough critic..especially in restaurants,but this was just ridiculous.

After 10 minutes, the waitress came back and said they had to restart the steak because she never told them how its done. We said we wanted medium and then she said my salad was ready. I said I'd wait for his steak to come out, but she said it would take 14 minutes. I said that's fine and she said she'd get us cheesecake as desserts on her. We didn't eat the cheesecake as we waited because that would be stupid, so we just sat there. When the hibatchi steak came out, my husband said it was good until he got to the 2nd piece. The rest of the steak was purple...disgusting. Not even red, or bloody...raw and right out of the fridge purple. My husband was sickened by this and couldn't eat. We asked for our cheesecake to go and we wanted to leave ASAP because he was getting nauseous.

Jim B.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2014,"Today I went here with a co-worker whose appearance looks questionable but he's wealthy. We were seated in the back of the restaurant in one of the booth's farthest from the front door (really thought the staff thought we may run out on our check and thus the seating arrangement). Then we were greeted by our waitress ( I will not disclose her name in this venue) who then asked us what we would like to drink, I explained that I am driving so I would just like a diet coke, my co-worker asked for a cranberry juice. No alcohol involved. She returned with our non-alcoholic drinks but then informed us that there would be a shift change and then passed us off to another waiter. To be honest I felt that she assumed based on her assumptions that she was not going to get a good tip from us so she passed us off to another waiter. The new waiter arrived and we ordered our appetizers and entrees, the new waiter then asked my co-worker if he would like another cranberry juice, when my co-worker responded yes the new waiter said "" I hope she informed you that these are not refills and are charged individually"" I immediately responded that that is not an issue and the waiter left. I ordered the Firecracker Salmon Rolls as an appetizer and the Chicken & Shrimp  Jambalaya as an entrée. My co-worker ordered a Margherita Pizza and the Chicken & Biscuits. the Salmon rolls were mediocre at best, tasted more like salmon rolled into wonton wrappers, fried and put on a plate with a bed of soy sauce and red cabbage. The Chicken & Shrimp Jambalaya was even worse. It tasted like cooked pasta was put into a bowl, pre-cooked shrimp and chicken were then added, then a frozen bag of pepper strips and a can of tomato sauce. Oh, and then garnished with cayenne pepper to make it ""spicy"". Also, there was so much water in the bottom of the dish there is no doubt that the ingredients were not fresh and the plate felt hot as if it had been microwaved.  If those ingredients ""were"" fresh and not ""frozen"" then they need to check their suppliers. All during this time the Waitress that was supposed to be off was still there waiting on other tables that arrived after we did. Just FYI, my mother raised 6 kids as a waitress by herself before working for the federal govt. I worked with her for 4 years during my teens in the same restaurant steaming crabs. She relied on her tips and I ALWAYS leave a good tip. The ""replacement waiter"" did a good job. The food sucked but on a bill of $75.42 I gave him the check back with $120.00 cash and told him to just give me $10.00 back because I did not have change. In other words he got a $34.58 tip. Which is roughly a 47% gratuity. As a result of this experience I will never eat at The Cheesecake Factory again and I will inform all of my friends not to do so as well. Bye the way, If you want a great Jambalaya go to Kramer""s Bookstore on Connecticut Ave. in NW DC and get the Fettuccine New Orleans, they've been serving it for years and it's absolutely delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=280
Kathy M.,"Manassas, VA",0,51,8,2.0,8/4/2014,"This location is going to ""sink"" the brand.  I have frequented many Cheesecake locations I ordered the Jambalaya pasta at the Hanover, MD location and it was horrible.  No where near the dish it use to be.  They have basically stripped out all of the flavor so that all you get is bland over-cooked pasta with protein and vegetables and cayenne sprinkled around the edges of the plate.  NO FLAVOR cooked into the dish at all.  This use to be one of my favorite dishes and it was extremely flavorful.  I would rather they have raised the price of the dish instead of lowering the quality of it.   I cannot believe that the quality of the food has diminished like this and that they are deceiving folks.    I complained on their website and was contacted by the manager and sent a gift card and asked to try it again.  I went back on Saturday night 8/2/2014 and tried the dish again (thinking perhaps it could have been an off night for the kitchen) but no such luck-- Same story--dish cooked the same unacceptable way so I sent it back again FOR THE SECOND TIME.  I will not return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=280

Seems incongruous to open The Cheesecake Factory in a casino, right? The national chain of popular resties is known for it's family-style environment, in which many celebrate birthdays, anniversies and the like. Well, they could probably put a CF anywhere and people will flock to it like bees to honey. It's on the outside of the Maryland Live! Casino so families with youngins' not fit for the slots can come and go as they please.  It's a smaller member in the group of area CF's, yet it's elegant and the decor is more upscale than the others. I can't wait to come back for happy hour or on a romantic date in the evening. From what I hear the lighting is lovely, ladies! As far as the fare, you know the drill. The menu selection is massive and the portions are even bigger. You can basically find ANYTHING to eat here. But, beware, don't overdo it or you won't have space (without a trip to the bathroom) to sample their namesake specialty cheesecakes. I had the latest limited edition Hershey's one and I savored it for 3 days because it was THAT good. Drinks are also served in huge glasses and fail to disappoint, if not a little on the overly sweet side. I tried a Pinaepple Mojito and it was fantastic, which is interesting since I usually avoid them because I can't get with sweet and minty.

When I visit, I'm ordering the Thai lettuce wraps 90% of the time as my entree. I use it as an excuse to get a slice of cheesecake to go. :) Thai wraps to me is like the one thing I could eat once a day and never get sick of. You have the sweet, heat, and sour... My fav flavor combination. It's also a textural heaven with the julienned veggies of cucumbers and carrots. The coconut thin vermicelli noodles sprinkled with sesame seeds for crunch.. Cilantro.. Chopped peanuts.. Ahhh! Soo good all wrapped into a butter leaf lettuce! They have 3 amazing sauces that accompany this dish.. A spicy peanut sauce, a tamarind sauce, and a cilantro/honey/cumin sauce. It's messy to eat but worth all the wet napkins you'll be needing. You can forget the bread basket they give you at the start that's complimentary and if it wasn't, I would be happy paying for it. It's soft and chewy and with the whipped butter.. Ohh wow. Look at me with my run-on sentences. Now I either get the Godiva chocolate cheesecake slice with sliced strawberries ( you have to ask ) and whipped cream. I'm not a chocolate person but when I do get chocolate.. I do it right and it's dark chocolate. The strawberries balance out the richness of this dessert which can easily be divided over 3 days. My new discovery, is their pineapple upside-down cheesecake. This is just crack.. Plain and simple. I want to go door-to-door with plates of this stuff and spread happiness everywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=240

Wendy M.,"Silver Spring, MD",196,73,13,2.0,5/30/2013,"I WILL NEVER BE BACK. Firs of all let me say that the reason for giving them two stars is because their food was edible. That's it.  I was very surprised to know that to apply to be a server at Cheesecake Factory, you have to have years of prior serving experience. I think my emotionally sour, angst-filled, people-hating teenage brother could have provided better service than the THREE servers COMBINED who came back and forth to our table, who probably have had ""years"" of experience serving. It seemed as if my boyfriend and I had not walked into a Cheesecake factory, which is supposed to be a great restaurant with delicious food and EXCELLENT service, but rather an institution for people with memory loss and horrible customer service skills. Let's start by saying this chain itself is not too bad. The Cheesecake Factory location in Columbia, MD, is better. Go there if you have a hankering for yummy mango cheesecake and good food.  It was a weekday night, so this restaurant was decently busy. We were informed our wait would be about 15 minutes. That was fine, since I had expected around half an hour. EXCEPT...15 minutes went by, then 20...then 25...then 30...We took our pager back to the counter, just to find that we had been buzzed already and that our pager was broken. It would be another 15 minute wait. OKAY FINE, but could we get an apology? Nope, the girl at the desk made it seem like it had been our fault our pager was broken. Like we'd actually spent the past twenty minutes huddled over the pager with screwdrivers, giggling and taking all the wires out.  Finally, we were seated. The waitress seemed decently friendly, and gave us both menus and asked us what we'd like to drink. Both my boyfriend and I ordered waters. It took about fifteen minutes for the water to actually come out. What were they doing, milking the great cow of wonderful tap water? We placed our orders, him for some Jambalaya and I for the skinnylicious turkey sandwich. I noticed the people around us had straws for their water, so I asked our waitress to come by with some straws and lemons. Fifteen minutes later, I asked another waitress for straws and lemons. Ten minutes later, my boyfriend finished his nasty tap water. That's when the second waitress decided to come by with straws. No lemons. I asked her to bring lemons, and she said she would. Maybe she was scared we'd squirt them in her eyes in revenge for the horrible service, but I couldn't do that because she never came back with lemons. It took this terrible cheesecake factory an additional 40 minutes to cook our food. Seriously? The skinnylicious turkey sandwich requires no cooking and is only about 4 inches in diameter (warning to everyone! THE SKINNYLICIOUS MENU IS ONLY ENOUGH FOOD FOR ANOREXIC BABIES WHO WANT TO PAY ADULT PRICES!) The fries I got with my sandwich were soggy and limp and seemed like they had gone for a nice, hour-long swim in stale oil. To make this worse, the waitress did not seem to understand that most people like their fries with ketchup or some sort of seasoning. I had to actually ask yet another waitress (our first one never came back until the end) to bring me some ketchup for my sad excuse for fries. The ketchup came in about five minutes, the quickest thing that had been served so far. Maybe next time I go to a cheesecake factory I should just order ketchup. My boyfriend's jambalaya looked like some middle school science experiment, and the rice was crunchy - not in a good way, but in a this-chef-does-not-know-how-to-cook-rice way. The seasoning was too strong, and not mixed in very well.  So in summary, we starved for about 40 minutes before we were seated, about fifteen minutes for water, starved another 45 minutes for our food...and all the things you'd think servers with years of experience would know to do, such as give customers straws, ketchup, and requested lemons, were completely absent. And following our disgruntled prodding at our food, I at my gerber-bite-sized sandwich and he at his puke-looking-uncooked rice, our original waitress finally showed up. I have to give her props for being so obliviously cheerful. She came up to us and told us she hoped we had a great dinner, and asked what we'd like for dessert.  I was so fed up with the terrible service I told her I wanted nothing but the check. She looked extremely surprised, like two people who had just paid a horrible amount of money for crappy food and even crappier service should give Cheesecake factory the opportunity to show them how rock-bottom they could get. My boyfriend and I paid the bill and left.  I can't speak for the actual cheesecake here, since I didn't actually have it. But I do know that I will never, ever, EVER be back for the dine-in experience at this restaurant EVER AGAIN. It wasn't that busy when we ordered our food, since the two tables to our right were completely empty. So what's your excuse, Cheesecake Factory?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=240

The buffalo wings and spinach-artichoke dip were especially good, and I love the chips they serve with the dip. The avocado egg rolls were great, as well. The nachos could have used more cheese, or at least have the cheese dispersed more evenly over the chips - some chips didn't get any.

Vivi N.,"Lanham, MD",16,82,111,4.0,8/26/2012,"I honestly didn't know that this establishment came along with Maryland Live!, a very much publicized casino. It was only when I ran into a friend at Arundel Mills that she told me that Cheesecake Factory was inside of the casino.  Interesting. I walked in and went straight to the Take-Out cheesecake counter. I was feening for some quick sugar. (I ain't ashamed!). Peering inside the see-through counter, I was impressed with their variety. Each slice was either $6.95 or $7.95. I almost lost my shit when I saw a Snickers cheesecake. I heart Snickers (from time to time, of course). After probing, the associate pulled out the cake to show me. My excited quickly dissipated. The cake looked gooey, and quite honestly, like a baby threw up on top of the cake. That's where the Snickers part was located. I'm pretty sure it's tasty but seeing it up close, I just found myself giving a stank face. A few minutes later, I'm pretty sure I fainted when 'Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake' flashed across the screen above the register counter. I heart Reese's (all the time, of course). I made a mental note to come back and taste this heavenly wonder. Yes, I'm already proclaiming it to be heavenly. In the end, I went with the vanilla bean cheesecake (DELICIOUS!) and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake (It was for my Mom but I sneaked a bite. All I have to say is when did nuts come with Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough? Not impressed).  All in all, I was fine with my orders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=240

For a restaurant that's not busy what so ever, they really are very slow. Now the server, her attitude was great very cheerful and nice. That does not excuse how slow the service was. We entered the restaurant at around 255 pm got seated at around 305 and the server did not come to the table until 315 and then got water until 320. The food came out at 350 when the server took the order around 325 or so.  The food on the other hand was great. No complaints their, and very good portions. I almost wanted to give this review one star due to the service but because of the food i gave them two. To me the experience starts as soon as the customer walks in the door. I can understand slow service when the establishment is busy, but i can honestly say that their was maybe ten tables with customers at the time. I was very tempted to walk out and go across to Bobby Burgers,  but i waited it out since my daughter loves to eat at cheese cake. I can say that i will not return, at least to this restaurant.

The thing is... I don't think people really mind waiting an eternity for monster size portions of food with slabs of cheesecake to wash it down. I think we mind having our expectations set for 30 minutes before being seated and then actually waiting an eternity for a table when we could have killed some time in the mall or casino had we been advised more accurately. The bathroom here is always an utter disaster. There are no paper towels ever in sight to dry your hands/ open the door with, as was the case this past Saturday at 7pm. Toilets were unflushed. Toilet paper was strewn across the floor. Soap dispensers were empty. Even chick fil a appears to have a regular schedule for employee bathroom checks but I've never seen a staff member attending to the ladies' room here. The miso Salmon entree is always spot on. There's an abundant selection of cheesecake to choose from which have all worked out great for me over the years, and I love many of their appetizers. The kitchen and menu don't seem to be an issue here but overall management of this location could stand to see some improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=20
Bridgette S.,"Tampa, FL",390,95,105,3.0,6/6/2016,"As it was Sunday evening after 7pm and most of the other mall restaurants were closing, we got our pager for the standard Cheesecake Factory wait. But as luck would have it, we were able to snag a high top in the bar area. Yay! It took a long time for a server to come and greet us and overall just seemed to be moving in slow motion the entire evening. Though he was very sweet and kind, there was just no sense of American urgency. If I were in Europe dining, the pace would have been expected. The only issue - we were starving!  We got our bread and butter, which helped to stave off the 4 hungry ladies.  The CF menu is extensive, but I ordered from the Skinny Lite menu and got the chicken enchiladas. They were yummy, but tasted slightly over cooked. The veggie salad that came with it to keep it ""skinny"" was a vinegar laced dish made with cucumbers, carrots. It was yummy. Another friend got the crab bites and stuffed mushrooms and polished those off. The other got the pasta Diablo and said that was her fave. And another got the Thai lettuce wraps which was a beautiful presentation with huge, leafy green lettuce leaves.  All in all, it was a yummy meal, just a bit slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3?start=20
Loryn C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",262,53,94,4.0,12/1/2017,"Great place. I love the interior of the restaurant. We came at night and it had a nice dark lighting that really made the ambiance. I ordered the NY steak. This was easily one of the best steaks I've ever had. Juicy, good seasoning, and stayed true to its medium-well done cooking. Also the portions were big. They have a wide variety of food items on their menu, as well alcoholic beverages.  Giving this 4 stars because the service wasn't good. The food took forever to come out - more than 30 minutes. Even our initial drinks took like 15 minutes to come out. Our party was one of the only diners in the restaurant so I'm not sure why it took so long. I would come back. Hopefully they'll get faster at preparing food and stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3
Erica S.,"Houston, TX",121,112,110,4.0,9/9/2017,"Visiting from Houston and decided to pop in here for the consistent food and a few drinks while sitting at the bar. Bartender Janie was professional, prompt and friendly! God bless the staff for the drunk morons they must have to put up with on a daily basis!  I ordered the Renee lunch plate which I didn't really care for only as the sandwich had far to much celery in the chicken salad for my taste. It wasn't chicken salad...it was celery salad. The baked potato soup was very yummy! It also comes with a garden salad but I opted to change to a Cesar for a $1 more. Not wild about the Cesar dressing either. It seemed watered down.  Drinks were great and poured on the heavy end. I ordered cheesecake to-go only as I was tired of the loud, drunk women sitting beside me at 3pm in the afternoon. (Eye roll!)  Cheesecake was perfect later on! I'd return to this location if back in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3
Felicity W.,"Doswell, VA",15,8,4,3.0,9/5/2017,I give 3 stars cause the food was great!! But the service was horribly slow and our waitress only checked on us twice.

Kenneth C.,"Washington, DC",97,50,77,3.0,12/19/2017,"I came on a weekday with a friend and the the Factory was predictably relatively quiet and clean. This location was pretty big and spacious and throughout the meal I had a great view of the reactions to the day's gambling/slot results. The food was good and similar to any other Cheesecake Factory meal which is really a product of the saying ""you get what you pay for and nothing more.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3
Kevin L.,"Towson, MD",0,7,1,5.0,1/7/2018,"Personally, from my experience, I do not understand the low reviews this place has received, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and will be back again. My girlfriend and I came here for a New Years Eve dinner before heading out for our festivities for the night. Initially walking in, the interior fascinated us, as do all other Cheesecake Factory locations. It was well kept, neat, and very professional looking. The host/hostess were very nice and immediately placed us in a wait, though the wait was long, it was expected as Cheesecake is infamous for not taking reservations. Our waitress was very nice and uplifting, she recommended what was good on the menu and she was completely right! Overall, would come back again. Nice job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3
Julie P.,"College Park, MD",249,30,29,2.0,1/5/2018,"Unfortunately, my experience here was an incredible disappointment. The main issue my boyfriend and I had was with the pastas we ordered. Not only were they dry and bland, it felt like it was made in a rush or was frozen food. We could not even finish the plate or even half. The pasta was on the hard side and even the chicken did not have a taste. We heard great things about Cheesecake Factory and really wanted to like the food, but that was not the case. We also got the calamari as appetizer and it was good in my opinion. I would give that maybe 3.5 or 4 stars if I could rate the dish. The service was also great. Our waiter Long was amazing and friendly, but we will not be returning. In addition, the floors were not clean and made my booties slip! Being inside a huge casino I really expected better of the food & the floors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3

Matt L.,"Dublin, CA",0,26,13,4.0,12/11/2017,Maybe you just need the right server. Food was good. Had the firecracker salmon and cauliflower for appetizers.

Kylie B.,"Baltimore, MD",49,44,71,5.0,12/18/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is always good. I've been to a lot of locations in the area. I always get the fried mac and cheese balls, Chris' outrageous cheesecake, and strawberry lemonade. They're good but can be a little pricey so I usually omit an entree unless my parents are taking me. I like their Caesar salad too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3
Evie B.,"Silver Spring, MD",40,41,599,1.0,12/6/2017,"I've been to many CF locations and this one has the absolute worst customer service and is super slow. I ordered a lunch portion Santa Fe salad with no torilla strips and salad dressing on the side. I received a dinner portion with no torilla strips and it was already dressed. When I asked the server if this was a lunch or dinner portion he just shrugged instead of giving me an answer. When I inquired with the waiter he told me it was a dinner portion to which the entire table included me responded with ""I/She ordered a lunch portion. Then the waiter gave me the salad dressing I ordered on the side. I told him the salad was already dressed even though I ordered it on the side. So now we have two mistakes. The waiter never attempted to correct my order but instead offered me cheesecake. I didn't want cheesecake. I wanted my order correct. The reason why I wanted the salad with dressing on the side was because I knew I would not finish it and dressed salad does not work well for a doggie  bag. When I received the bill all the people at my table wanted to know if I was charged for the lunch or dinner portion. I asked the waiter and he said the dinner portion. I didn't complain because at this point I was over this entire experience. One of the people at the table suggested to the waiter to offer me a gift card but he stuck with the initial offer for cheesecake. I ended up picking something random from the dessert menu since I'm not big on dessert. I gave the dessert to my neighbor. So thank you CF for my $20 dessert that I didn't eat. As I suspected I was also unable to eat the rest of my salad for dinner so I trashed it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3

My server was Antoinette and she was really on it. Not one time did I have to wonder where she was or look for her.  When I go to the Cheesecake factory I always order the exact same thing. Shrimp Scampi. I am going to grow up one day and try something different. I also tried the Korean Fried Cauliflower. That was delicious. I am actually about to eat it for breakfast in a few minutes.  The Cheesecake factory never disappoints me. I also had a peanut butter fudge cheesecake too as well.

C J.,"Severn, MD",2,63,16,2.0,9/5/2017,First of all the food sucks. Second the server was inattentive. We asked for bread and was told the bread was still cooking. When we got the bread one loaf was hot the other two were old and stale. I ordered buffalo wings and asked for them to be cooked a little crispy instead it looked like they were double breaded and hard. My Aunt ordered the chicken Campanula. She said it was good. He didn't ask if we wanted more drinks which we did. He did not fill up my water until I asked. He did not ask my sister if she wanted anything when she joined us. He did not give us the check until we asked him to give it to us. What a mess! This guy's not getting a big tip from me today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3

The menu is so overwhelming..too many items to choose from. How can you really specialize is 100 dishes?? I ordered a simple cheese burger with fries.  The fries were soo incredibly salty and just warm. I didnt complain, I just didnt eat them.  My friend ordered a pasta dish that BARELY  had any sausage. The drinks were okay. If you're looking for a real basic experience, this is the place to go.  Not a foodies paradise by any means.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-hanover-3
Gary G.,"Washington, DC",9,204,103,3.0,8/25/2017,"Arrived around 5:30pm on a Friday night and waited about 5 minutes before being seated. We tried a Carne Asada Steak Medallion dinner special that was delicious and reasonably priced compared to the rest of the menu. It came with six medallions, corn that was nicely seasoned, and enough rice to feed a family. It reminded me of a Japanese steakhouse that piles on the rice to have you walk away full. My wife and I were shocked at our $81 bill that included two bar drinks priced at $11 and $12...mojito and pink lemonade. My wife said we'll go elsewhere next time we want dinner and drinks at that cost. We bought cheesecake to-go which I'm looking forward to trying in a bit.

Carmen M.,"Rockville, MD",310,133,618,4.0,8/19/2016,"Cheesecake Factory food usually comes in huge portions and is very delicious. This time, I didn't think that the food tasted all that great. I usually stick with the Farfalle pasta or the Jambalaya, but I wanted to be adventurous and tried the Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta because it looked good in pictures. Honestly, I think it was a little too sweet. It had a weird sweet and sour taste, and the only spicy thing about it was that there was a little kick at the end. My sister got the Louisiana pasta which is pretty similar to the Farfalle pasta dish, but the Louisiana pasta didn't really taste like anything. It was just very greasy and the chicken seemed a bit dry.  After reading other reviews, I can see what they mean about the service. The hostess said that there wasn't no wait, but we still waited about 15 min.
