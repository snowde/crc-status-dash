Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",770,1004,3191,5.0,4/11/2017,"This is one of the only chain restaurants I frequent because I think their cheesecake and their selection is absolutely amazing. Hubby and I usually share an appetizer and then two cheesecakes. Our favorites include any of the egg rolls, fried Mac and cheese balls and lettuce wraps. And for dessert either the Reese's, the Oreo, the S'more or the the Chocolate Hazelnut (although there are a TON more awesome options)! Another cool factor, if you have a baby they give you complimentary plate of banana slices. Who knew?! My baby boy certainly enjoyed those.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20
Betcy W.,"Henderson, NV",31,54,186,4.0,12/2/2017,"Tried their Miso Marinated Salmon, such a tasty and beautiful dish. I loved the white sauce that gives it a sweet taste. Comes with brown or white rice and snow peas. Portion was great too I was able to take leftovers. I recommend this dish if you're in the mood for some seafood. Our server was great, made sure our drinks were refilled and was very attentive. I like the dim lighting and atmosphere is quite romantic. This place gets pretty pact and although they don't take reservations until after 8pm I would call ahead and ask what the wait time is. We were able to get seated right away on a Wednesday night though. I'll definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20
Jacqui C.,"Henderson, NV",54,170,116,5.0,10/18/2017,"If you're willing to come to The Cheesecake Factory for a bite to eat one day, coming during Happy Hour is a must! It's from 4-6 PM every weekday and it's half-off alcoholic drinks and select appetizers. My two friends and I came here during Happy Hour and we were expecting it to be a little busy, but it really wasn't once we walked in...of course it's a Wednesday afternoon. I tried the fried Mac and Cheese, which was excellent, along with a $5.95 margarita. What a deal that was. I'm glad I came during Happy Hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20
Keoni B.,"Henderson, NV",5,67,245,4.0,9/10/2017,Best thing about Cheesecake Factory is that the variety their menu is so big that there is a very good chance that you will find something you will like. The last few times we have come here it seems the server takes a long time to take our order but once they get it things go by pretty fast. Our food was delicious and prepared to our request and the staff friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20
Michele M.,"Henderson, NV",92,251,407,3.0,4/15/2017,"I love this restaurant and the service inside is fine but take out is horrible! I've had many issues with being put on hold for 10 minutes and my order is wrong 90% of the time. I've started going inside and checking my order before I leave, so I can ask for the items they forgot. (Every time!) It's annoying because they offer curb side takeout but when they forget stuff, you have to wait for them to go back inside and get it.  If I was rating the food, I would give them 5 stars but since I order takeout 95% off the time, my rating is based on the takeout service, which is lacking.  They get super busy, pretty much every day of the week, so be prepared for a wait. They are open until midnight on the weekend and it's way less busy around 10pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20

The atmosphere is quite romantic, at dinner time, you don't have to worry about seeing the real face of your date, cuz the light is really low, guarantee anything would look better in that lighting they set up for ya.  The food is also pretty good, huge portion!! I can't never finished my food. Cheese bread appetizer for $9 is ridiculous when I comes in 6 pieces and the cheese doesn't even melted all the way. I expected more from $9 appetizer.  Big parking lot with specific 15 mins parking spot for pick up order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20
Mark L.,"Lafayette, LA",89,475,581,5.0,7/16/2017,"I am a fan of The Cheesecake Factory chain and I think they must have a secret record for the largest menu in a chain restaurant.   There isn't much you can't get here and there is something for everyone.  Chicken, steaks, seafood, burgers(which are incredible), pasta, Mexican and the list goes on and on.   The best part is their huge range of desserts and cheesecakes.  I can't remember the exact number but there are 20 or so flavors of Cheesecake with each sounding better than the last.  They also have ice cream and lots of other desserts.   My latest visit was for a party of 8 and we had a wonderful time.  I didn't mention the drinks but they do have a nice wine selection, a full menu of mixed drinks unique to their franchise and of course they can make you a cocktail of choice.  If you want a great restaurant with awesome desserts, be certain to stop here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20
Lisa ..,"Las Vegas, NV",0,22,3,2.0,12/24/2017,"I normally go to the CCF in Boca park, but a friend and I decided to try this location. It was around 2pm and upon entering we saw an older woman at the hostess stand. She glanced up at us, then looked back down. No greeting whatsoever! So I said hello there is 2 of us and she never spoke to us. How rude! CCF needs to realize in a huge way that the hostess is your first point of contact to your guests, and if they don't acknowledge or greet your paying customers, well.... Fast forward a month or so we decide to give this location another try (December 6, 2017). We see the same older woman now working with a hispanic looking young girl. Let me say this...the young girl couldn't even speak proper English and had no personality. That's it CCF, get your act together. Hire people on your front line who are personable, friendly and know how to greet the public!! It's not that hard to do!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20

The reason why is my food never come out right sometimes.  The tables inside are so close to each other.  That's why I like seating outside. The food is a lot.  This place is always busy too.  Anyway, overalI I will still come back hehehe.  Can't stay away from those cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20

I rarely give 3 star reviews , none of the food we ordered arrived on-time to our satisfaction. I had to ask for the bread-and-butter more than 3 times . And I was given the excuse that it's in the oven , which I can understand because it was a busy night. We ordered some beers that came without the foam on the top , and we got a horrible excuse that beers don't come with forming the on the top. Like always the food was very good.

Bekah S.,"Queen Creek, AZ",49,141,272,4.0,5/31/2017,I adore CF's Thai Lettuce wraps.  It's an appetizer but filling enough for a meal and the sauces that accompany the chicken satay are amazing!   All in all I don't usually go for anything else on the menu.  My husband likes the Louisiana chicken and we both like the fresh bread served as an appetizer.  CF is usually crowded and loud.  But the service is typically good and the portion sizes are huge!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20
Brian F.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,117,261,5.0,9/29/2016,"I don't know what it is about this place, but Cheesecake Factory just seems to always be on point. No matter if it's this location or any other location across the country, Cheesecake Factory is just consistent and delicious.  This place is pretty much a great restaurant that caters to all. You come here and always see large groups of families, especially little ones. If you come for lunch, this seems to be the spot for moms/wife's lunch dates with their friends. High school kids date nights. Or, for myself, just your casual Friday night date spot with the girlfriend. There is always a line here and usually always a wait. However, it's so big and they have such a big staff and kitchen, the wait is never that long. The food here seems to always hit the spot. They have something for every taste bud. Not the greatest, but they a pretty good job for every kind of dish for a place that doesn't specialize in one thing. The portions are huge. Some of my favorites are: Red Sangria Chinese Chicken Salad Salmon Kale Salad Beet and Goat Cheese Pear Goat cheese flatbread (substitute blue cheese for goat cheese - thank me later) Chicken Nachos Chicken Gyoza  Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken Orange Chicken Spicy Cashew Chicken Egg rolls  And of course - the cheesecake Just overall a great spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=20

Lili K.,"Henderson, NV",103,28,19,5.0,9/4/2016,"Called last Thursday a To-Go Curbside order. The man who took my order was very cordial, let me know they had gotten pretty busy already. I got to the parking lot and the curbside attendant was getting someone's card and before I could even call them she came to my car for my payment because she already knew my order was packed up. Prompt polite service, food was delicious, and will be back to try a different cheesecake this week! (: Also I am kind of a salad freak- many places like Olive Garden and Chili's have that out-of-a-can dressing taste where there's either not enough or too much but CF has their Caesar salad down PERFECTLY.

Casey Q.,"Las Vegas, NV",64,15,1,2.0,7/8/2017,"We've been to this location multiple times over the years.  The food is typically delicious and service great.  The biggest problem is getting a table. Our most recent experience was a Saturday night during dinner time with a group of 10. We understand that makes it more difficult, but the restaurant didn't handle it correctly. We were told the wait for a table would be 45-50 minutes, but we're not seated until over an hour and twenty minutes elapsed. The worst part was that it was clear that the restaurant was not properly staffed for a Saturday night. They had an entire section of tables empty while the lobby was full of people waiting.  We suspect that the kitchen was understaffed because f he amount of time it took to get food out. Again, food was delicious and waiter was great but the mismanagement of the staffing is almost enough to make me not want to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=100

Gloria W.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,22,,2.0,7/16/2017,"I had the chicken salad sandwich with the side salad.  The sandwich was cut into very narrow portions maybe 1 inch by 3 or so inches long.  I saw a lot of tomato and lettuce between those little strips of bread and very little chicken salad.  Hard to eat without it spilling out all over the place.  The chicken salad itself was very disappointing.  Very bland with virtually nothing in it. And that poor side salad - looks like a bagged salad mix of baby greens and other lettuces that came to me looking like the dressing had been poured on it and it had sat awhile,   it was completely wilted and limp.  Very unappetizing. I wound up eating part of my husband's Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich which was pretty good.  We decided to split a key lime cheesecake which is very good.  I think this restaurant's forte is in the desserts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=100
Jane J.,"Henderson, NV",0,32,,4.0,4/3/2017,"I love, love the food here.  The food quality is superb. However the downsides are this place is almost always loud & crowded. It is difficult to have a quiet meal here. They never take a reservation for any reason. I wish they did. Wait times; u will have a 30 minute or more wait outside the restaurant. I personally think they should offer a discount to regular customers or locals, on entrees or specialty meals. I would come more often if it werent for the high price tab. It is also very expensive to get a drink at this place. Therefore this can be an expensive date night",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=100

I get that it was a combination plate hence the extra small portion. The Herb Crusted salmon was dry and a little burnt.

Tara J.,"Las Vegas, NV",26,101,40,1.0,7/30/2016,"I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory location many times and have never had an issue with the service or food previously. However, I had an awful experience today that warrants a one star rating.  In honor of national cheesecake day, the Cheesecake Factory is offering half price cheesecake. What a deal! And it is. But who knew that you'd have to deal with snotty, rude and unprofessional employees in order to get your piece of the pie, or cheesecake, in this instance?  So I go in and it's busy. Like really, really busy. And of course it is! The best cheesecake on planet earth is half off! I go right to the counter line and after waiting for about 5 minutes (which was actually quicker than I thought it would be considering how busy they were) I got to the counter and get not so much as a hello, hi, what can I get for you? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Just a girl staring at me waiting for me to place my order. Ok-they're busy and she's probably stressed. I get that. No biggie.  I requested 4 pieces of cheesecake - 2 Reece's, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. Alas, I was informed that it's only 1 piece half off per person. Since I'm there by myself, I'm basically only able to get 1 piece at the discount and the rest will be full price. No problem - it makes sense to put a cap on it so that people don't go crazy. I decide that I don't want to pay full price for 3 pieces and adjust my order to remove the salted caramel and just ordered 2 Reece's and 1 snickers.  I pay and even leave a small tip ($3) in the tip cup. I walk away from the counter and a couple minutes later she calls me back to get my cheesecake. I look in the bag and unfortunately there's 1 Reece's, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. NOT what I'd ordered, paid and even TIPPED for! This, my cheesecake loving friends, is how the rest of my visit went - verbatim: Me: Oh shoot, I didn't want the salted caramel. That was the one I cancelled.  Her: So what do you want then? Me: 2 Reece's and 1 snickers. I'm sorry.  * At this point she ROLLS HER EYES and SHAKES HER HEAD, takes out the salted caramel and walks away. I am so disappointed and feel like I'm putting her out when in all actuality, it was HER that made the mistake and ME that was being apologetic about it. Huh? * Me: (out loud and to no one in particular) Not sure what that attitude is all about.  The manager is standing there and overheard my comment and this is how the remainder of my visit went, again verbatim: Manager: Well you know what it is, ma'am? We're not even supposed to be doing this.  Me: You're not supposed to be doing what? Manager: Giving half price for take out orders. We're actually only supposed to be honoring it for dine in customers.  Me: Well I certainly appreciate that you're honoring it but I don't think the attitude that comes along with it is necessary.  And at that point I got my CORRECT cheesecake and walked out.  It's unfortunate that the manager chose to defend his employee ROLLING HER EYES and SHAKING HER HEAD at me rather than apologize for her completely unprofessional and unjustified behavior. Like I said, I get that they're busy. I understand that it's a stressful job. And I definitely appreciate that they honored the discounted price when, apparently, they didn't have to. But as a customer, I should not be treated that way, especially when the mistake wasn't mine and I was kind and gracious even when she made the mistake.  Shame on this employee and shame on this manager (both whose names I didn't get, dang it). Hopefully their attitudes improve-for the sake of other customers who don't deserve to be treated so poorly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=80

Gary was very kind, funny and very engaging. My fiancé didn't know what kind of cocktail to have and he recommended a Georgia Peach cocktail which is pretty much now her favorite drink.

You will be treated 'like royalty' here and the food is super-fresh (gotta try those Summer Shrimp Spring Rolls while they last!!) and the Cob Salad we had filled me up (and that's not easy to do since I have a big appetite and love to chow down!).

From the time we were brought to our table to the time we left, everything was a great experience! Tiffany, our waitress deserves a special shout out for being so attentive to our group! Every time I eat at a Cheesecake Factory, I typically order the same food dishes, starting off with the avocado egg rolls with the sweet cilantro dressing. If you've never had these, definitely order them as a starter! Ah - Maze - Zing! I'm also a burger lover and saw the Mac n cheese burger!? What?! My two favorites put into a burger! Now, I'll be honest, it was delicious to have Lk that extra cheese, I wish the fried Mac n cheese had more of a crunch. I feel the cheese sauce doused that crunch one would want for texture contrast. Minor detail, it was cheesy, beefy, and the sweet potato fries were delicious! With the amazing portions that you are served, you have to remember to leave room for dessert! To top off such an epic meal, a slice of salted caramel cheesecake is always a great closer!

Shab N.,"Las Vegas, NV",176,15,30,4.0,8/9/2015,"I went out to eat with my family tonight to eat at Cheesecake Factory. My family and I often choose to go here when we do go out. This location is always busy. I highly recommend to get there early if you have big groups. We were only four people and waited 10-20 minutes. You have the option of sitting inside, outside, or whatever is first available. We chose to sit inside. Once seated, our server, Nathan, came by with waters and bread. The bread basket consisted of sourdough bread, a wheat bread, and white bread. I ordered a raspberry lemonade and it was pretty good. I definitely like the strawberry one better but it's not bad if you want to try something new. My family and I ordered the avocado egg rolls as our appetizer being that it's our favorite whenever we come. It was perfectly fried and the avocados inside were delicious and ripe. I chose to order a new dish tonight so I went for the farfalle pasta with chicken and roasted garlic. I'm a huge fan of bow tie pasta so I had to try it. Once I received it though I was a bit underwhelmed. The pasta was cooked perfectly but the chicken was okay. They also left huge chunks of garlic in the pasta so if you're not a garlic fan, ask for it without it. The pasta wasn't horrible but it definitely wasn't the best I've had there. I feel like I've had better farfalle at other restaurants. Besides the pasta, everything relate else was great.   We ordered dessert to go (red velvet cheesecake and cherry cheesecake). Red velvet is THE best! It's part cake and part cheesecake--perfect combo!  Our server Nathan was awesome and made sure we were always taken care of during dinner.

Louisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",889,1080,6699,3.0,3/15/2014,"I really dig this place. It presents a lively atmosphere with huge portions of food that are reasonable for the prices you pay. Don't be alarmed by the $14 cheeseburger, it's a nice portion and higher quality ingredients than your average chain restaurant. The cheesecakes are amazing, and they even have an Atkins-friendly low carb cheesecake that's made with Splenda and a crushed nut crust! It's crazy good.  Why do I frequent this restaurant? They have an understanding of special food and diet requests. I live a low carb lifestyle and it's so easy to make substitutions here. Salad, broccoli, spinach or green beans instead of fries? No problem. No bun? They'll lettuce wrap it! My new ""thing"" is to get the chicken pasta with spinach instead of pasta. Yes, the kitchen will easily accommodate special orders. It might take a lot longer to get your food (my last visit there resulted in a wait time of nearly 55 minutes from the time I placed my order 'til the food arrived), but at least the cooks get it right.  Minus a star because of three problems: 1. The usual slow service: it shouldn't take nearly an hour for food to come out of the kitchen when the restaurant is 3/4 full 2. The always dirty and gross bathrooms: Yuck, clean up more often, please! 3.

My daughters usually get the kids marinara pasta, the chicken dumplings (an appetizer, but they eat it as a meal) or nachos, which 2-5 can share.  Of course, the cheesecake is what they really want, and it is pretty delicious if I do say, all 3577326786 calories a bite. It's not like we eat cheesecake everyday though, so it's okay. The chocolate lava cake is quite good, as well.  Service has always been consistent and friendly, however, weekend nights be prepared to wait at least 30 for a table. Prices are average for that type of restaurant, a couple cocktails, 4 meals, a cheesecake or ice cream is around $100. Minus tip.  It's s go to for us on a Friday night after the kids sports stuff.

Their utensils like knives, forks and spoon are just sitting on top of the table, who knows how dirty the tables are.

We had the steak with medallions off this skinnylicious menu and we also had the chicken Alfredo.  The steak on our plate was amazing. Mashed potatoes with asparagus, roasted tomatoes, and steak medallions all layered on top made a perfect combo. Steak was cooked medium rare as requested. Juicy chicken and perfect al dente noodles mixed with the amazing flavor of the Alfredo sauce.  So happy. I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri. It was blended all the way through with no ice in the bottom like I experience from most places. Deliciously fresh flavor with just a hint of rum.

Mel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",238,1504,8259,4.0,9/21/2013,"Who says that Cheesecake Factory has to be busy with long waits? Who says you can't find something somewhat healthy at a Cheesecake Factory? Nutrition wise, I've been trying to clean it up for the last 10+ weeks. Sometimes eating meals prepped at home can be a bit of a grind.  So, it's good to eat out every once in awhile to break up the monotony. I recently met up with the gf and a friend for lunch here. I discovered their Skinnylicious menu a couple of months ago, so I knew I'd find something clean. Just a reminder, this is a Cheesecake Factory and that means big portions.  Their Skinnylicious menu is no different.  You can get a range from salmon, turkey, lean steak, and chicken off their healthier side of the menu. But don't expect super low calories due to the portion size.  My advice, split your meal.  But for me, I'm going to be all I can be and eat all I can eat...in moderation that is.  If you do that, then expect a calorie range between 490-590.  Still...this isn't too bad. Like the rest of the Cheesecake Factories out there, there's always something for everyone.  Since I've only had something off their Skinnylicious menu at this location, I am not able to comment on the rest of their food.  I have been to other Cheesecake Factories and pretty much tried everything. I have never been disappointed.  Service was great here and ironically, we didn't have to wait too long to be seated and served.  I'll most definitely be back.   YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (417/500)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=160

The second time around we asked for bread again , I was already done with my plate by the time he noticed that we didn't have the bread we ordered.

Kaitlyn T.,"Henderson, NV",69,89,12,4.0,12/27/2014,Went here today craving a salad. I was so surprised at the excellent service and fresh food for a chain restaurant- my only complaints- 1- I got a bowl of soup while my husband got a cup- volume wise they were the same- price wise $2 difference 2-the appetizer kale salad $595 and the entree salad $995- also same size  However our waitress was excellent! She vm brought us banana slices for the baby! Thanks for awesome service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=280
Bunny G.,"The Woodlands, TX",840,1160,3986,2.0,7/24/2012,"I'm not on a quest to go to CF every weekend, but coincidentally it seems like I am. We ""happened"" to be in the neighborhood so when all else fails, cheesecake seems to work.  I have to say this visit was not inspiring.  The Caesar salad is always a favorite and my mini foodie always insists we order it, so that's an automatic. We started off with an appetizer.  We got the sweet corn tamales and I was a little disappointed, bland despite all the flavors of avocado, parsley, tomato and sour cream, it just gets a two star. I ordered the shrimp tacos and the side serving of rice was so lame!  Usually I get enough to share so the serving was disappointing. My little one ordered a pepperoni pizza and this time it was greasy and slimy. YUK. Overall, I won't be visiting this Cheesecake, I'll stick to Summerlin or the Ceasar's Palace one instead:( Oh, BTW service was good but waiter a bit robotic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=280

Bonnie P.,"Henderson, NV",217,601,120,3.0,3/3/2013,"3.5 stars We've been to this location once and only for cheesecake.  But, in general, we really do like the food at The Cheesecake Factory and sometimes even crave some of the apps and meals here.  But there are a few things that keep us from coming more often. The good:  The cheesecake is delicious, and there are SO many options.  I want to try them all but usually can't pass up Reese's or Red Velvet and my husband LOVES the Snickers flavor.  And the portion is very large.  I had to bring some of mine home!  The service was friendly and efficient.  When we sat down our server immediately brought us bread, and we thanked him but told him we'd only be having dessert.  He brought our cheesecake quickly, kept our waters filled, and brought the bill promptly.  Don't you hate going somewhere for dessert and waiting like an hour to receive your bill? So glad that didn't happen!  The not-so-good:  This place is just expensive.  Seriously.  Sometimes I wonder - what right do they have to charge these prices?  It's a good chain but our cheesecake cost as much as a small dinner somewhere else!  We knew that going in so it wasn't a surprise but just be aware that cheesecake costs a small fortune here.   The lighting is very dark.  I have excellent vision and I was squinting to see the menu.  It almost made me too tired to eat cheesecake.  But I found it in me to keep going.  I can't STAND the seating.  The table you get can make or break your experience.  They have these HUGE cushy booths that they do give to parties of 2 - I saw it.  But of course we get that small 2 person table crammed between two different parties on that really long booth.  Ugh, I could hear entire conversations of the people on either side of me.  And that awkward moment when you have to turn sideways to get in or leave the booth and hope you're not brushing someone's plate with your rear end... I know I'm making kind of a big deal about this but it really is annoying to me.  Please, spread the tables out more. Overall this is a restaurant that we enjoy coming to sometimes. They have a really great menu selection of food, drinks and cheesecake.  But it's just a once-in-a-blue-moon thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=280

Carrie M.,"Henderson, NV",1,7,2,2.0,7/18/2016,"While the food was great, our server was less than caring about our 29th and our relatives 6th wedding anniversary!  The last 3 years previous to this, we had a wonderful waitress every year who made sure that the cheesecake had a little candle and happy anniversary written in chocolate or something like that.  This kid just verbalized it, that's it.  Now if it was a birthday, I'm sure there would have been a big deal made.... Guess what?  Achieving each year in marriage is way more of an accomplishment than aging.  I felt slighted and I think NEXT YEAR we will start a new tradition at a different restaurant!  Just because you get a different waitress does not mean your special day shouldn't be special.  Sorry but train your ""I've only been here for 3 month"" juvenile waiters to be compassionate.  Oh and nice how if you linger a little they start ""dropping hints"" ....

Brie G.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,26,4,2.0,12/16/2017,"TERRIBLE SERVICE: Where do I even start. Firstly, they attempted to seat us to a small table where if we were to have accepted we would have been sitting elbow to elbow to the person sharing the booth seat. No problem, and a quick fix. They quickly sat us at a booth, which was nice and we appreciated that accommodation. 5 minutes later our server D shows up to take our drink order, she grabs our drinks quickly, sets them down, and rushes away. We had in mind an appetizer we wanted to order and that would have been a great time to order however she didn't stop at the table for even a second for us to do that. Another 5-7 minutes later she shows up once more and asks us if we are set to order. As we order she seems rushed, and quickly leaves our table once again. After our appetizer gets to the table brought by I assume a runner she never once came by to ask if we need anything. Here and there she would grab our drinks to refill without asking and wouldn't say a word, never spending even a second at the table to give us a chance to ask for anything. Once our food arrived the runner put our food down and ran off before asking if we needed anything else before I could process that I had blue cheese, and not ranch on my plate. I was expecting our server to show up and ask us how everything was, or to ask if we need anything else but no nothing. Since we were seated near a server station my husband waved down another server who was standing around conversing with another server. She fingered hold on to my husband and finished her conversation. She finally came over and asked my husband if he needed something and when he said we needed a side of ranch, and buffalo sauce she ran off to get it. Another server (still not ours) brought the ranch, and said she'd be back with the buffalo sauce. 2 minutes later, the buffalo sauce finally arrived. After our meals were almost done another server saw that our drinks were low, and offered to refill them. Once completely finished, our server finally arrived and asked about dessert. The check arrived with our to go desserts because we couldn't stand to be in there any longer. Long story short, the service was terrible. My two stars are only for the food, that was better than the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=60

We ordered egg roll and calamari and the sauce was amazing with it. We ordered fettuccini, kids pizza, pork chop and veggie burger. All of which was just okay. Fettuccini was bland. Pizza did not have enough sauce, pork chop was overpowered by the Apple sauce. Veggie burger was different from last time where it consisted of beets while this time it was beans and brown rice.

Lauren C.,"Henderson, NV",284,984,2581,4.0,1/3/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the few chains that I not only like, but I think is pretty good. This location is conveniently located inside The District. It's on the opposite side from most of the shopping so parking is easy. Just like most of their locations they have an enormous amount of seating and outdoor seating as well. The patio is a nice option when the weather is nice. The menu has a large amount of options and a large variety of options as well. There should be something here to please everyone. I like that a group could come in and order completely different foods. Surprisingly, everything I've had is really good. They are one of the few places that can pull off a large menu without sacrificing taste. The portions are always big enough to make into two meals. I love fun lunch leftovers. This is one of the few restaurants that make it easy for someone on a diet if you aren't looking to treat yourself. The Skinnylicious menu has some great options and the calories are listed on the menu. They couldn't make it easier for someone counting calories. The cheesecake lives up to the hype and just like the regular menu there are a ridiculous amount of options. My favorite is the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake.  Pricing is reasonable for the portion sizes. As I mentioned, most entrees are big enough to be two or three servings for the average person. I've been to this location many times and service has always been great.

Arthur M.,"Henderson, NV",103,451,1748,3.0,6/9/2016,"We usually make it here at least a couple of times a year. This time, we were influenced by $50 in gift cards to dine on a Wednesday night around 7:30. Our party of seven waited about 15 minutes outside before we were greeted by our server who was kind enough to come outside and lead us inside to our table. The menu can be overwelming with endless choices. But that is good for our group which has a pretty wide spectrum of preferences. There hasn't been too many changes to the menu over the years with the small plates and Skinnylicious options being the most recent to me. For the rookies, don't go hog wild on the bread, because you won't be able to finish your three-serving portion entree. Our order was pretty varied which included two entree salads, three sandwiches, a pasta dish, and the filet medallion off the Skinnylicious menu for me. There was plenty of ""filler"" vegetables and not a lot of beef for my entree as expected, but the vegetables were cooked and seasoned well. The pasta dishes have never really impressed me, but the salads are surprisingly good. If I don't get a steak dish, I'll usually get the tuna tataki salad which is a very flavorful salad. Everyone was happy with their meals with over half us needing take out boxes. We finished with two pieces of cheesecake. Over time, I've found that I prefer cheesecakes without any cake mixed in like the fresh strawberry, banana cream, and salted caramel. I do have to comment on our server who left a good first impression by greeting us outside, but everything else really wasn't up to par. To add to the rehearsed, corny jokes where the response was crickets chirping after each one, he had no organization of our orders. Stating that I was seat 1 when taking drink orders and my daughter was seat 7 sitting across from me at the end of the table, he had no clue who drank what when he brought the drinks out, auctioning each one and running back and forth across the table. He forgot my mother and wife's glasses of wine, didn't notice they were without beverage after three return trips to the table, and he had to be reminded by me to grab them at the bar after 15 minutes. Then he did the always annoying checking every three minutes if I had signed the receipt after he ran my credit card. Which meant he was cut and wanting to bolt, but you don't want to perturb the person that is signing off on your tip. Before gift cards were discounted, our check was a reasonable $163. What you'll get with Cheesecake Factory, as you will with other successful chains, is consistency. They need that consistency to handle the amount of volume that comes through the doors. The food and atmosphere in this location are also consistent with every other restaurant. The changing variable is the service, which is usually a hit. It comes down to whether you think that consistency is good, and I would tend to agree with most Yelpers that it is A-OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=60

Steve H.,"Henderson, NV",39,95,37,5.0,3/7/2017,L)Amazing that I have passed this restaurant ten thousand million time as its about 2 miles from my home. Well I was invited to a business lunch on Sat at noon....not a good time or day as this very large restaurant was crowded to the rim. Surprised at the great service. There is something for everyone on their giant menu. I ordered the Cuban sandwich. While is was super sized the quality was not up to pare. The  Cuban cafe off of the 215 and Eastern has the real deal. The other 5 guests all enjoyed their fare. The selections of cheese cakes were amazing and New York quality. My choice of the 2 chocolate Hershey was over the top. 5 stars and 5 million calories.The only downside was that prices tended to be somewhat higher then other similar fair,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=60

Anyone else run into this problem?  Anywho, we were on this side of town and we didn't care for anywhere on the strip(don't think anyone who works on the Strip cares either)and we were Chinatown'd out (also a famous area for Dirty Dining lately...looking at you, Joyful House!) Prices are very reasonable here and the portions are HUMANGOUS which is why I like to order off their Small Plates Menu and I always get the Pear, Bleu Cheese,  and Pecan Flatbread which has always been consistently good. I also got the Veggie Fries Combo which came with Portabellos, Zucchini, and Avocados. The avocados were my least favorite because they have no business being in the fryer IMO. These are one of those things that are great as-is.

The cheesecakes are sold by the entrance, where you can purchase whole cheesecakes or slices. The pricing for them was surprisingly high. Some of the whole cheesecakes ranged from $20 to $50 or more. The slices were $7 to $9, which are small in length, but a lot taller than the normal cheesecake you would find somewhere else so the slices are still very fulfilling. When we first came in, the hostess wasn't very welcoming, but the servers were great throughout the entire time we dined there! They were attentive and friendly.

We patiently waited for our food that took ALMOST 30 MINUTES without the server even telling us that our food is coming up or updating us or whatever. We saw the table over (who got there about 7 minutes after us) get their food first!!!!!!!  Then upon getting boxes, our server goes, ""okay KIDS can I get you anything else"". That's soooooo rude! I don't go to a restaurant saying ""okay GRANDMA this is what I want"" to my server. So since I was a ""kid"" we tipped like we were ""kids"".

I'm horrible at deciding what to eat, and with a million choices it makes it that much harder for me. I looked at the menu for a good 20 minutes. I finally chose the bbq bacon burger. It came piled high with crispy onion rings, bbq sauce and bacon. It was deelicious! I got a side of the ranch to dip my fries into and it's the best Ranch I've ever had. It's garlicky and has a bit of a kick to it. So good. You can purchase a jar to go, FYI. My other half had the pasta carbonara with chicken and he really liked it. Others in our party had bbq chicken pizza, fettuccine alfredo, corn dogs and a club sandwich. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  Now you can't go to CCF and not order cheesecake. I spent another 20 mins deciding which flavor I wanted. I finally chose the oreo and it was amazing. I also got to sample the smores, reeses, and banana cream pie cheesecakes. They were all pretty good. The reeses has an over powering peanut butter flavor which I didn't really care for. The smores one was really good and the banana cream was good as well. I can't wait until they have their pumpkin cheesecake. I love that you can walk in and just purchase cheesecake by the slice without having to dine in.

Isaac D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,2,5.0,8/11/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is in a great location right off of the 215 and Green Valley. Lots of available parking, comparatively speaking to the Summerlin location at Boca Park. We arrived at 6:30pm this Friday night and waited for about 30 minutes. Even though it was really busy, none of the servers seemed to be running around with no remorse for guests who were waiting in the lobby/hostess area. I've been to Cheesecake Factory's in the past where this has happened. After we sat down we were greeted by our waitress Andrea R. Very knowledgeable, very friendly and patient. DEFINITELY, three important qualities needed for working here as a server.  We started with avocado egg rolls and buffalo blasts. Avocado egg rolls, as always were fantastic. Buffalo blasts were great as well, however it seems there's a little too much extra breading around the outside. I'm sure for the cooking style it's beneficial, and they are still very delicious otherwise and definitely a sufficient enough portion.  Since the dishes are so plentiful, I chose to order an additional appetizer, the Crabcakes. They were fantastic (even though I only enjoyed one of the three) and served fairly well. The only adjustment to this dish I would make is how the Crabcakes are served. They are presented on a bed of Chinese noodles (little foam type noodles). As you cut through the Crabcakes the noodles stick to the Crabcake and it changes the consistency of the bite. The crabcake itself was DELICIOUS. But, it would have been far better if I didn't have to fight noodles through every bite!  After dinner I had the Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Cup Ripple Cheesecake and it is wonderful. Not too sweet, very satisfying if you're a chocolate lover.  The service here is excellent, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere like any Cheesecake Factory is comfortable. I will come back here again and I would recommend any one else too as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=40

He was not wearing a nametag, but he must be the tallest guy there. I ordered an Eggs Benedict with regular bacon, as I always do, and my husband go the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. What I loved about both of these is that the condiments were in small bowls on the plates, rather than dealing with messy ketchup bottles. The lettuce and tomato for the sandwich were off to the side, so they stayed nice and cold. Nice touch. My bacon was not super crispy, but overall the benedict was pretty good.

Fried Mac 'N Cheese balls--macaroni put into a ball, deep fried, with creamy marinara and parmesan cheese sauce. Fried calamari (self explanatory)--however it's paired with cocktail sauce (I prefer marinara). Buffalo blasts-- chicken marinated in buffalo sauce wrapped in a wonton and deep fried.

Jared N.,"Henderson, NV",269,546,370,3.0,8/2/2017,"This factory was in full production mode when I came in on Monday afternoon.  I mean it was really hopping.  I came in at 2:00 PM thinking I would have missed the lunch rush and beat the dinner rush.  It did work out that way.  I had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  I guess that is what happend when they offer cheesecake slices for half price.  Thats what brought me in.  Oh, and the prospect of a good lunch. I was seated after waiting a while which I didn't fully mind.  I would have been fine sitting at the bar if it got me seated sooner but I had a nice table to myself when I was seated.  My serve came over right away and brought my bread and water out pretty quickly.  For my lunch I ordered the lunch size pasta DiVinci.  Afterall, it has MUSHROOMS!  It also has grilled onions, chicken and sauce.  I asked for some fresh grated cheese to top it.  This was not a bad bowl of pasta but it could have been better.  The pasta to chicken ratio seemed off.  The mushrooms were good.  The onion tasted burnt.  And there seemed to be a taste of burnt oil too.  It wasn't terribly off putting but it was noticeable.  The dish has a lot of potential but I think the kitchen was bitten by the mass crowds and suffered for it.  Regardelss, I saved some for later and also asked to have my left over bread packaged to-go.  This was a late lunch/early dinner.  I knew I would be hungry again before bed time.  So asking for a doggie bag was my way of planning ahead.  I also wanted to save room for the cheesecake that brought me in in the first place. For dessert, I ordered a slice of tiramisu cheesecake.  That combines two of my favorite desserts into one delectable sin on a plate.  Coffee soaked lady fingers for a crust, soft and fluffy cheesecake filling, a dusting of cocoa powder, and a dollup of chocolate whipped cream made this one delicious way to end my afternoon.  I'd order that in a heartbeat (possibly my last heartbeat at the rate I'm going with these dishes).  But there are so many other options to try.  This is the Cheesecake Factory, you know.  What kind of place would it be if it didn't have too many cheesecake options?  All the more reason to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=40

The massive menu here makes it a challenge to find the dishes that they do well here. The wife had the chicken maderia, which she enjoyed the balsamic tasting sauce on top of the potatoes and chicken. The spicy spinach dip was tasty with nice crisp chips on the side was definitely a highlight. And of course washed it all down with a nice hunk of peanut butter cup cheese cake at the end, which was excellent. Service and ambience was great!

It took another ten minutes to get two more plates delivered. The final plate, however didn't arrive at our table until after we'd all finished eating.

Literally he walked up to our table says ""hoe does the food taste"" we reply good (because it did taste good, the appetizers we had gotten) then he walks away with not one other word. I will definitely be making an official complaint to their corporate. I can forgive the late food but for the manager to not even acknowledge the issues after the Waiter brought it to his attention he also did not even apologize for the issues.

We arrived at 5 pm ( they don't take reservations), there were only 20 of us to which they said It'd be a half hour wait. An hour and fifteen minutes later we are finally seated. The service was great. Very fast paced, they got us what we needed. The cocktails were nice! The bread was just bread, nothing spectacular. I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta for the main course. It was decent, but I had to order a side of Buffalo sauce and chili flakes. Barely any spice to it. I was rather satisfied with the portion though. Dessert was great of course.

The bad: It is from 4-6 PM.  This was the one day in 2 years of living near CF that Eric R. and I both were home before 6.  He was on the phone with a friend from 5:15-5:45 when I finally asked ""happy hour or not?!?!?"" We got there at 5:47 and our bartender Sam was cool and patient with Eric (he gets grumpy when hungry and wanted bread and a BIG water glass.  He says CF discriminates against water drinkers because my iced tea glass can eat his water glass). With a big debate between 2 or 3 appetizers, Sam assured us they, unlike the evil elephant bar, give FULL appetizer portions for the $5 price.  We ordered 3: chicken potstickers, shrimp summer rolls, and tamale corn cakes sans sour cream.  Full portions they were.  Lots of food, multiple dishes, and my tea = $18.  Nyah Nyah, China Tango!

Jean G.,"Bullhead City, AZ",87,267,143,4.0,1/5/2018,"***PROS*** * Short wait for table - 10 mins * Attentive waiter - never hungry, thirsty, or wondering where he was * Great food! We had 4-cheese pasta which tasted like a pizza with so much flavor, herb-crusted, grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes that were wonderful, and tempura-battered fish tacos with chipotle sauce, pickled red cabbage, salsa and guacamole that was delicious.  * Complimentary bread at table was warm and fresh, served with large pats of butter * Strawberry lemonade had real strawberry seeds in it, sugar rim on the glass, and wonderful sour flavor.  * Cheesecake to go was packaged with extra whipped cream and plenty of napkins & forks ***CONS*** The only ""con"" was that the waiter mentioned the computers were slow because of a Christmas coupon that was difficult to enter yet many customers were using. I wish we knew about the coupon. I'd say check their website for details, get on their mailing list, or follow their social media accounts for details.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson
Sam O.,"Las Vegas, NV",118,98,215,2.0,1/11/2018,"So let me start by saying we are HUGE fans of the Cheesecake Factory ! They have amazing Food with a great all around selection of dishes , desserts and appetizers!! We have been going here since it has opened and in no way will we stop going and or want anyone reading this to be discouraged of going as well !!  Tonight we decided to go during HAPPY HOUR to have a couple drinks, dinner and spend some time together as a couple ! Our service was an issue from the start with a very slow start ! We ordered our drinks and something was floating in my wife's drink and we asked for another one ! We watched very closely to ensure that she received a fresh drink and this time the glass was dirty ! Third one was the charm although she really on drank one drink !! My beer on the other was tasty but and hour later finally received my second !  The waitress was nice and we did give her some feedback and I must say she had enough courage to tell her manager without us asking ! The first manager approached us and was full of excuses from the start blaming Happy Hour - For real , you have happy hour the same time everyday and a manager should never Make Excuses !! They had 2 bartenders three servers and a manager with less than 50 people to wait on ! Later on in the evening Dawn , another manager came to our table and took full responsibility and apologized 100% with no excuses giving us a 6.00 discount ! We were not looking for anything but I must say overall a disappointing experience this time around !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson

Used a gift card for chicken potstickers and mixed veggie salad with added chicken. The potstickers were actually tasty and the shoyu sauce pleasing. Pal commented on how pure and unburpy the meat was. Loved the green onions on it. The mixed salad had a lot of cheese chunks and mixtures of salad, asparagus and stuff. Don't remember a heavy or creamy dressing, but it was flavorful enough not to miss it. Great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson

It's by far my favorite place to go, especially with the family since there is so much variety to choose from.i usually end up getting appetizers as meals every time I go. This time was no different except I added a cup of clam chowder to it. Oh man, that clam chowder was amazing. And filling! I could hardly finish my other food. I got nachos, sweet corn tamale cakes along with the mix of egg rolls (sorry, no picture). Avocado, Cuban, chicken southwest and the salmon one. In my opinion all tasted great except for the Cuban one, didn't care for the ham flavor in it. I just wasn't a big fan of it. Everything else, amazing.

Depending on the day and time, you may have a wait.  Attempted to go here on a discount cheesecake night and the expected wait was 45 minutes to an hour.  I'm not sure how long it was because we bailed after 20 minutes. Back to the last time my family and I ate here this past week.  The food looks amazing.  (See my pictures). The taste is OK.  The side salad was supposed to have balsamic dressing and I tasted none, so I left it.  The chicken salad sandwich is delicious!  Should have gotten the full size instead of the lunch special, as the soup was also only OK.

We started with waters all around and a couple of cocktails: the strawberry martini and the factory peach Bellini, both drinks were very good 5/5.  For appetizers we ordered the avocado spring rolls 5/5.  The bread was also delivered with butter and the wheat loaf is always delicious.  For entree's we ordered the Orange Chicken: deep fried pieces of chicken breast covered in sweet and spicy orange sauce accompanied with rice (white or brown) and veggies, usually lots of snow peas and some carrots 5/5, shrimp jambalaya delicious flavors 5/5, shrimp pasta 4/5, and the chicken salad with extra chicken 4/5. For desserts we tried the white chocolate raspberry 5/5 and the Craig's crazy carrot cake cheesecake 5/5! Honestly I think all of heir desserts are 5/5!

Jordan I.,"Las Vegas, NV",68,133,791,4.0,10/11/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my family's go-to restaurants, whether it be for dinner on the weekend or when we're celebrating a special occasion. The menu at The Cheesecake Factory is very extensive, a bit overwhelming at that! With the menu consisting of just about 20 pages, everyone is bound to find something they'll enjoy. The food is consistent, always fresh, and the portions are ridiculously huge. I always have leftovers for lunch the next day! A few of my favorite dishes include the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad and the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  If you have room, there are over 50 cheesecakes and various desserts to choose from! We normally come to an agreement (which can be hard) and share a slice! Seriously, after a meal here, a slice of cheesecake will push you to the edge. During our most recent visit, we received the most outstanding service from Aiden! He was on his A-game from start to finish, exceptional to say the least. He was very informative when we had questions about items on the menu and even recommended a few of his favorites! Aiden was constantly checking up on my family and always made sure that our waters (and bread basket) were filled. Not to mention, he can really carry a tune! We were very impressed! Thank you, Aiden! Now, if only it wasn't so dark inside the restaurant! The ambience is nice, don't get me wrong, but I wish the lighting wasn't so dim! There was a single light shining down from the high ceiling in the middle of our table, and everyone was taking turns using it to read the menu. I know, it sounds ridiculous, but it's true. With the sun going down sooner in the day, there's not much natural light left to come through the windows before dinnertime.

By the time we came back, the table was cleared and setup for someone else.  I asked our waitress why they cleared the table and she said that she thought we left, even though we ordered drinks and had bread on our plates.

It's exactly what it's called and the flavor is delicious! I also like ordering the egg roll sampler -- because I can't choose just one type of egg roll lol.  When I'm on my lunch break with co-workers, we sit at the bar and get quick service. The lunch specials are amazing and so are the prices. I love the crusted Chicken Romano lunch special!

He even had some staff sing to my friend for her birthday! Now that's customer service!  Now for the best part: dessert. Anything is delicious, really.

Mihya P.,"Henderson, NV",0,6,17,5.0,11/13/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has to be my favorite restaurant ever. It is the perfect place for any occasion.  My favorite things about this restaurant is how it is dimly lit. It adds a more intimate atmosphere and makes the room feel more luxurious. The music they play definitely makes the experience a lot better. It can be quite busy every night as it is perfect for a casual dinner or more special dinner. The servers have always been great and very friendly!  The menu offers you so many different choices. My personal favorites is the fried calamari for appetizer, of course the delicious complimentary bread basket, the herb crusted salmon and mashed potatoes with asparagus and a lemon sauce, I made the mistake of switching it up one night and got a rice dish, nothing compares to the salmon, then finish it off with, of course, cheesecake!

Love G.,"Henderson, NV",78,55,64,5.0,6/16/2017,"This is my second time at this location, and definitely not the last. The Cheesecake Factory is my FAVORITE restaurant, I am always at the location in Los Angeles which is where I'm from.  Since it was a Friday night it was about a 30-minute wait and I got there around 6:15 PM. There were a lot of parties waiting - for graduations, and also it's Father's Day weekend. The 30 minutes went by quick though, as I was looking through the menu and picking out a cheesecake to order for dessert in their display. 30 minutes is such a nice waiting time, and didn't seem that long especially because the one I go to in LA has a wait time that goes almost 2 hours! It's crazy.  I ordered a strawberry lemonade with a Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms - it was in a wine sauce with bow tie pasta around it! It was delicious and I loved the plating. My uncle got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta with shrimp and chicken and it was so yummy. Not too spicy at all! We also ordered the carrot cake cheesecake. I liked it. I've tried almost every cheesecake and this just crosses it off my list! Took two bites and had to take it to go because I was too full.  Our waiter Brittany was very attentive and nice and checked up on us! Definitely a plus when waiters/waitresses come and check on us every so often rather than waiting for one to come by.  Wish it wasn't so hot outside, maybe next time I'll sit outside and enjoy the view! (And all the cars driving by lol).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson

However, it's always well worth the wait.  We arrived and it seemed as if the parking lot was completely full. Upon entering, we were told there would be a 10 minute wait. This was perfect, a 10 minute wait gives an opportunity for winding down just prior to your meal. The hostesses Michelle and Kelli greeted us with a huge smile's and we're very cordial.  After about five minutes of waiting our name was called and we were seated.  Our waiter, Todd was nothing short of amazing.  We didn't have drinks however ordered right away.  I was considering something different so I tried the Shepherds Pie.

Your100poundlife 1.,"Monrovia, CA",3,11,20,4.0,11/9/2017,"Calorieake Factory, Henderson, NV 250 lbs - Drawn like fat little moths to our glittering temple.... If you're going to visit a restaurant that more than lives up to its reputation for dietary madness, go on an unrestricted night, because it's stupidly futile to observe gustatory rigor at The Caloriecake Factory. Their well-honed formula will suck dollars from your wallet and pack pounds on your waist.  And it is a successful formula, at least as best I can tell: each dish is savory and well prepared if not totally inspired, and most spill over the sides of large plates. Gracious, competent staff, expensive drinks, and no room for dessert, which you will order anyway.  Chicken Madeira: Heavy and comfortish, with nicely cooked chicken breast slathered in peas, carrots, heavy cream/chicken/cheese sauce, stacked on top of a George Foreman fist sized serving of creamy potatoes. Because this setup is too low carb, Caloriecake adds two standard sized buttery biscuits on top of all this, which is good because I totally didn't get enough bread before the meal. With butter. And beer.  Total calorie weigh-in: 1650 for just the dish alone.  Bacon-bacon burger: perfect sear over hot pink beef. Soft, sweetish french roll, fresh crispy veggies, and a joyfully disgusting amount of cheddar cheese and mayo. Man, what a good burger! Alas, sidekicked by fries with a sadly low crunch halflife. The fries could be better.  Calories: 1500. This is so much naughty fun that it'll come with a hangover.  Caramel Salted Cheesecake: 1000 calories for one slice. I'm laughing as I type this.

It was a little drier than I'm used to, but it was fresh. The wait to from order was quick, bit the server was not up to par. We also had mentioned at several occasions that it was her birthday and the server also checked for her ID when she ordered her drink. In all honesty, it was the main reason we came here so we, plus the servers, could make her feel special on her birthday by singing her happy birthday -- but alas, our server did not do it and we left very unhappy.

Shawn J.,"Henderson, NV",450,792,202,1.0,10/24/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory sucks. Ain't no other way to say it. Let me explain why. I pull into the parking lot and am waiting on my wife to show up as she's on her way. I call and speak to ""Frank"" who tells me the wait list is only 5 minutes. I'm only 5 spaces from the front door and can see both front doors so...I'm thinking we're going to be good to go. Well 4 min later we're walking in the door and I get told the wait is now 20 minutes. Wow, that's quite a jump in only 4 minutes and there wasn't a horde of people rushing the door. Either someone can't count or someone was lying...got a hunch the counting ability is just fine.... So we get on the list, get our pager and then cool our heels outside. And outside stinks. Literally stinks. Like has anyone emptied the trash by the benches? Finally after a 25 min wait someone comes out and calls for us by name...the pager never did go off. I got the excuse that it doesn't work outside. Hmm, I guess having equipment with a range of 100 ft from the base station is asking too much.  So we finally get seated. And service...well, it was slow. You wait for bread. You wait for drinks. You wonder if the waiter went to the bar to watch the baseball game on TV. You wonder if there will ever be peace in the Middle East. And then you get to place an order. When you finally get your food well quite frankly it sucks. My soon to be 3 year old wanted chicken strips and he wanted apple juice. He picks up the juice, starts to move the straw to his mouth and is rewarded with an apple juice shower as the lid was not snapped all the way down on the cup. Nice...now I got a soggy kid. And that soggy kid ate some of the french fries but spit out the chicken. As for my wife, she ordered Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. She ate about 5 bites before she pushed it away. And I ordered a Mexico City Chicken dish that was marginally passable, but after a couple of bites it left my mouth feeling...well it's starchy...or like it's powdery..it's just weird. 2 hours after leaving the place my wife and I still have this strange aftertaste from their food. I've never really had an aftertaste like this before. Again it's just weird.  From walking in the front door until we left took almost 2 full hours. We spent $80 and ended up leaving well over 3/4 of our food for Republic Services to send to the Apex landfill. I can write that it sucked, but quite frankly that's understating just how bad it was.  My wife said to show mercy and give 2 Stars? Not a chance. If it sucks it sucks. Call it as I experience it and be done with it. 1 Star. And when you see penquins inside the gates to Hades, you might see me darken their doors again. Until such time...oh no Boo-Boo. Ain't going back here even if you tried to drag me in.  (With apologies to my wife who had a rough day and I thought a good meal with cheesecake might brighten her day, but instead these jackasses made it even worse! I waited a while to write this one so I could cool off but needless to say I was not happy when I left).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=260

Our waitress was very fast and knowledgeable of the menu and knew what she was doing. While the service was great, the food left a little to be desired. We started with the crab and artichoke dip. This was served with buttered pieces of toast. The dip was just drowning in oils and grease. It was like dipping grease into grease, not very good in my opinion. For our main corse I ordered the chicken madeira. For being the most famous dish, it was not really what I had my expectations set for. It was a great dish none the less and was prepaired flawlessly. The chef plated it very beautifully aswell.  My fiancé ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combination. Again the presentation was very beautiful and the only critic she had was that the scampi was a bit tangy for her taste. For desert we ordered the tiramisu and lemon meringue cheesecake to go, both were very good.

I was seated at a booth which I requested and was comfy. My friendly waitress greeted me asap and gave me a menu with the large variety of choices to choose from. I ended up going with the Salmon Miso which was topped on steamed rice and served with pea pods. The fish was fresh & moist and the miso sauce went good when combined with the rice and pods. Instead of going with a fancy cheesecake I chose the original which was served with whipped cream. The cheesecake was silky smooth and creamy and not overly rich but filling.

Amelinda L.,"Las Vegas, NV",956,641,6517,3.0,3/25/2014,"I've only been here a handful of times since I'm not in the Green Valley area often, so it's typically to meet other friends halfway or the location of birthday dinners, etc. I haven't been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory for several years now, however, I've been impressed during my last two visits. One big factor of my newfound respect is the addition of their SkinnyLicious menu. The primary reason I stopped dining with them was because of their calorie-heavy menu (they have pasta dishes that exceed 2,000 calories!). The menu features a list of items that were specially curated to not exceed 490 calories for appetizers and 590 calories for entrees and some items from their regular menu that happen to be under those thresholds. However, as I'm sure you've guessed, the portion sizes are cut dramatically. They apparently don't know how to cook filling and healthy dishes. Off their SkinnyLicious menu, I've tried the Santorini Farro Salad (farro, cucumbers, tomatoes, beets, red onions, feta cheese, tzatziki, and vinaigrette) and Chicken Samosas (crispy wrappers filled with spiced chicken with cilantro sauce). Both surprisingly delicious and not overly terrible for you. The salad was ridiculously small and there were four tiny samosas. The prices weren't bad, but it's sad considering the fact that those dishes were still loaded with calories and fat. I was surprised that their Fried Calamari (served with garlic dip and cocktail sauce) was really good. Also, I've had their Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad (grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, grilled corn, black beans, cucumber, and Romaine) with the dressing on the side. It was tasty and it was such a large portion that I couldn't finish it. The SkinnyLicious menu is great, however, it's really hard to love a place that serves dishes that have more calories than you should consume in a day. It's a shame that a lot of diners are really oblivious to restaurants' nutrition information and obviously, restaurants don't want to be transparent about it. So, although I don't advocate dining at these restaurants, if you do, as I'm sure I will in the future (even though I won't want to), definitely order off the SkinnyLicious menu. Side note: their Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake (seasonal) and many other cheesecakes are really good. Share it with 1-2 people and don't think about the calories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=140

Teri W.,"Henderson, NV",134,833,390,3.0,2/25/2015,"We had dinner at Settebello recently and nothing on their dessert menu interested us. So we decided to walk over to Cheesecake factor to share some cheesecake. It was a Saturday night and the place was jammin. Although, it seemed as if maybe they were short staffed, because at least 1/2 the restaurant was empty, but we had to wait to be seated (along with 3 or 4 other parties in front of us). Once we were seated, it took between 10-15 minutes for our server to approach the table. This wasn't a big deal, because we had already eaten and it gave us time to decide on what slices to order. But if I were hungry, I would have become hangry real quick. We decided to order 3 slices (all cheesecake): Banana cream, key lime and Kahlua Cocoa.  Our server returned a short while later and let us know that they were out of the banana cream and key lime, which were the 2 we really were excited to try.  We were pretty disappointed and I wish he would've known this when we ordered originally. We then decided on the mango key lime and lemon meringue instead. Now, it has been quite a long time (at least a few years) since I have been to Cheesecake Factory. They have a very large menu, and not many places can pull that off. However, the service was painstakingly slow.  We shouldn't be there more than an hour when we just ordered coffee/water and dessert. Although our service was very nice, I just didn't expect to be there as long as we were. It probably took 20-30 minutes just to get our order.  I mean, come on! For 3 slices of cheesecake, which is obviously pre-made? A bit ridiculous. Everything was really tasty, even if it was basically not what we originally wanted. We each had a different favorite - I actually quite liked the lemon meringue, which is not what I thought my favorite would be. The Kahlua Cocoa was really rich, but good as well. The mango key lime was probably my least favorite - I thought the mango over powered the key lime, but it wasn't bad by any means. The prices were reasonable. Our check was $28 for the slices and drinks (1 coffee). Overall, I remembered why I hadn't been in so long, since there are SO many other options in the area.

Overall, I'm very much happy with my experiences here. This chain has one of those menus that can please any palate. It takes quite a while to even go through the whole menu, it's about 6-7 pages long. They have breakfasts, sandwiches, salads, appetizers, pastas, seafood, meat, burgers, and of course, their infamous cheesecakes. We actually ordered salads, appetizers, and desserts to go on our last visit. I'd have to say if you do come at peak hours, they will be a wait to be seated.  I can't name all the foods I've eaten here, there's just too many. I'd have to say most of them are good and tasty. We've tried their salads recently, and were a bit disappointed. Just lots of wilted lettuce and not enough toppings. I'm not a big fan of their cheesecake, but I think it's because I prefer the denser version. Their other desserts, the Chocolate Truffle Cake and Carrot Cake, very yummy! Actually, all their other non-cheesecake desserts are phenomenal and huge-portioned. Definitely requires sharing! There's been good service, mediocre, and exceptional service on my visits. Overall, I'd have to say it's always decently good. Usually if it's bad, I remember it.

This place was busy, but it wasn't full to the brim. We didn't have to wait long for a table... maybe three minutes. I told the hostess that there were 2 (meaning two adults,) and one highchair.

Two different ladies told me that they would bring me a high chair, before a third one brought me one.....after she finished her conversation, of course. Our waitress comes by and asks us for our drink order (2 waters with lemon.) No straws. We ask for straws while we continue to look at the HUGE menu.  Now, I don't know how Cheesecake Factory's black straws come, but ours came UNwrapped, and the waitress felt the desire to put them in our drinks for us. I hope she washed her hands. She leaves us, and we decide on what we want. Menus closed, she passes us.  Passes us, again. aannnndd again.  My mom finally flags her down. The waitress said that she wasn't ""aware"" of our readiness. *sigh* whatever. My mom has appetizers, the tuna tar tar, and the white bean hummus. I ask for the Spicy crispy chicken sandwich. I ask what type of cheese is put on the sandwich. ""Jack"". Do you have Provolone? We have cheddar, blah blah blah blah. We can do a shredded mozzarella on it for you.  OKAY, so is that a NO, that you don't have provolone? Gotcha.  We wait a decent amount of time for our food. Thank goodness for their bread and butter, which you now have to ASK for. My mom's tar tar was small. Personal appetizer small. In my opinion, not enough to share. Her hummus was just thrown in the bowl, with a piece of the flatbread already in there, getting soggy, most likely. My sandwich was nothing special. Honestly, I've had a better one, out of a box, frozen. and it cost me $1 from my grocery store. It comes out, on a ""toasted"" brioche bun. With a rather large piece of fried chicken, that looks like it is missing from a red and white striped bucket. Why this is called ""spicy"", I will never know. Even with the entire side of chipotle mayo that  came with it, it was pretty bland. Blah Meh food, and meeeeeeeeehhhh service? Not so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=300

Oona W.,"Henderson, NV",817,97,1493,4.0,11/21/2014,"This particular location brings back the first time I ate here: I am down with the swirl, have jungle fever, a checkerboard chick, and all other silly names people come up with to express that they are open to all types of races. I love all guys--black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, tall, short, skinny, heavy, muscular, etc. I have no specific type. If you're hot, you're hot! RIGHT? So, one of my friends started this interracial meetup group and at the time I was NOT interested in dating. I am happiest being a loner. She talked me into accompanying her to the Cheescake Factory with the rest of the group that signed up. Now, I have enough common sense that groups like this rarely turn out the way you want because for one thing people in their 30s just don't sign up for stuff like that.  This was a Monday evening (happy hour) and it was fairly crowded. We were waiting for the RSVP's to show up and it was starting to crowd. While waiting a few males showed up and I could tell they were NOT her type. She was looking extremely irritated and I was having a blast, watching it all go down. LOL.... This man in his late 40's showed up and without any kind of greeting she jumped up from her seat and said, ""How old are you?!"" After he reluctantly said 47, she made it clear that this group was for no one over 40. I felt bad for him as he walked away and I secretly hoped he didn't return to shoot up the restaurant. Another male approached us wearing coke bottle glasses, a striped stained polo shirt, dirty, baggy bum jeans, and velcro snapper shoes. He looked just like Robin Williams in ""ONE HOUR PHOTO."" To make matters worse, he was hoarding several overused Walmart bags full of personal property! Maybe he thought he was gonna get lucky and have a place to stay tonight?! She tried to eliminate him by asking his age. He was a smart man, and he lied. Haha.....  Out of no where, I could see her hopes rising when two extrememly tall white males entered the restaurant. The kind of lads you see posing in an Abercrombie ad. She jumped up immediately and said, ""Are you here for the meetup group?!"" They looked surprised and said no. She slumped down like she had just completely given up. Inside, I was cracking up!  The happy hour menu is extremely cheap, nearly half off so I ordered a few appetizers. I got the calamari which is lightly breaded and extremely tender and juicy. It comes with 2 different dipping sauces, but the calamari is so good it can stand on its own with a little lemon juice. I like ordering off of their SKINNYLICIOUS menu which are items that are healthy and less calorie. The Arugula Salad containing Arugula, Marcona Almonds, Golden Raisins, Parmesan, Lemon and Olive Oil.....is sooooooo light and refreshing and is a great accompaniment to something that is fried.  So I sat there, watching some people make a connection and others look like they were ready to go. I chose to sit in a nuetral seat, meaning I sat between two females so that no one assumed I wanted to pair up. I wasn't there for a love connection--just a really yummy meal. This evening turned out to be hilarious--at my friends' expense. She didn't find anyone that fit her type.  Oh well! I left with a delicious OREO COOKIE CHEESECAKE! That's the ultimate love connection!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=300

This CCF is in a great location in the district at Green Valley.  It is your standard CCF with really dim lighting.  Sit outside if you can because it's a lot quitter and scenic. I tend to try to get Entrees that are more on the exotic side, it tends to pay off better than standard stuff.  The Jamaican Pepper shrimp is a celebration of flavors in your mouth.  I also like to get a post meal alcoholic shake like the flying gorilla.  Then sit around for another hour sipping it to annoy the waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=180

The only downer was that I was seated on the other side of the ice machine and I guess there was a leak because the area under my seat became wet with dirty cold water. I let the waitstaff know and they alerted the manager, but that didn't stop the hostess from seating another group in that same puddle.

Shirley B.,"Las Vegas, NV",186,501,2932,3.0,2/27/2013,"Wow what an improvement this place has made with the service issues since the last time I was here over a year ago and previous visits before that. Dinner hour was pretty busy but I didnt get handed a beeper and wait like always. This time I was able to walk up and hostess seated us right away.    Like I said the place was pretty slammed, but there was never a lag in wait time, and servers never doubted themselves, something that I had a problem with on previous visits. This time our server and the runners did a great job with taking our orders, getting our drinks, food and desserts to our table in a timely manner. We were always checked on, our drinks filled. Staff was attentive, everyone was friendly. No one seemed stressed out.  Only minor issue I had was when it got dark outside, the ambient lighting in the restaurant was too low.  We were cracking up because I was not the only table using their cell phone light to read the menu. The SkinnyLicious menu was new to me and I'm lovin it!  A lot of the items are low carb or low cal most under 500 calories. I would so order their Kale Salad and the Flatbread with Pear, Blue Cheese and Arugula again. Flavors tasted really fresh and it is noted on the menu they hand make these items to order.  Hard to imagine that healthier choices can taste so good and be low enough that I can have a slice of the delish Kahlua Cocoa cheesecake (better than the Tiramisu!)  and not feel to guilty having it since Im still under my calorie intake for the day. Sweet I can have my cheesecake and eat it too!  On the other hand the burrito and the chicken dish that were also ordered in our party didn't live up to the prices they charge for this (13.95 and 16.95) ..it looked and tasted blah.  With a very pleasant dining experience I had tonight, I wont be hesitant now coming here for lunch or dinner.

Samantha G.,"Chicago, IL",1090,1716,2662,4.0,10/24/2011,"It's a chain. I tend to avoid restaurant chains as much as I can. But there is a special little spot of love in my heart for the CF. And it has everything to do with the Buffalo Blasts, variety of cheesecakes, and Lemon Drop martinis. What, you don't know about the Buffalo Blasts?! They are perhaps one of the greatest appetizers ever devised. No, seriously. It's like a chicken wing chopped up, tossed with hot sauce and cheese, then stuffed into this crispy, fried triangle thingy. And then served with sides of an awesome hot sauce and an amazing blue cheese sauce. Tip: Order extra sides of the sauces right from the start. If you are a dipper, you're going to need extra. The Buffalo Blasts are basically some of the most awesome hot wings you will ever have. Everyone knows about the cheesecakes. So many by the slice that choosing even just two or three becomes a challenge. I have been known to take home six different slices with me. My go-to fav, though, is the White Chocolate Raspberry. And, call it sad or not, but it is some of my favorite cheesecake of anywhere ever. And I don't know what it is that they do to their Lemon Drop martinis, but I love them. I love them more than any other Lemon Drops from anywhere else. Maybe it's their lemonade. Maybe it's their sugar. I don't really care. I just know they are strong and delicious, and I need a friend to supervise me so I don't down like five of them. This location can get busy, so be prepared for a wait. The bar area is on the small side. Overall, nothing particularly noteworthy or different - it's the same as the rest of the CF locations.

Stephanie M.,"Albany, NY",3,12,1,2.0,3/14/2015,"My husband and I had lunch at this location today (a Saturday afternoon).  There was a short wait of about 10-15 minutes.  We were seated in the bar area.  It took our waitress a little while to come to our table, but I hate being rushed so I didn't mind.  Our server was very nice and courteous, and definitely the highlight of the meal.   My menu pages were greasy inside, like someone had butter on their hands and then touched the menu.  Gross.  Note to hostess desk - clean your menus! For an appetizer, the fried calamari was good, but a little too greasy.  For an entree, I ordered fish tacos, tortillas were very greasy and I had to send the dish back.  The second time they forgot to hold the cream, so I had to send my dish back again.  Coming from Los Angeles, I eat fish tacos all the time but these were just very bland.  I make them better at home.  I've had these before at another location and they were great, which is why I chose to order them.  By the time I finally got my food, I was already full from the appetizer and bread, so I just took them home.  If I knew I was taking a dish to go, fish tacos would be my last choice, since tortillas are obviously going to get soggy. My husband had to send his fettucine alfredo back because the pasta was all clumped together.  It's like they overcooked it, then left it sitting without the sauce so it all stuck together.  For $19 for pasta and chicken, that's just ridiculous.  The kitchen staff needs to raise their standards for the prices they charge.     I've never had a problem at other Cheesecake Factory locations, but this one was definitely sub-par, with the exception of our waitress.  She was terrific.  Overall, an experience I wouldn't want to repeat.  I'll probably stay away from Cheesecake Factory for awhile.  Waste of money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=320
Brandy B.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,35,3,3.0,9/27/2013,"In all our years, neither my husband nor myself have ever eaten at a Cheesecake Factory. So when my coworker gave me a giftcard, we decided to treat ourselves. Upon entering the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice how busy it was. We had to yell just to hear each other. This was on a Thursday around 6:30 pm. I would hate to see how packed it gets on a Saturday. We were seated after a short wait at a part booth/ part table. My husband took the booth side, and I sat in the uncomfortable and not-so-fat-friendly chair across from him. Halfway through the dinner service I moved to the booth with my husband because my butt was going numb. It's hilarious to me to think that a restaurant that serves food like a macaroni and cheese hamburger would use chairs that only a child or Victoria Beckham could fit into. My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the chicken penne. We were surprised how huge the servings were, and ended up taking half our food home with us. Next time we will probably just share an entrée. Overall, the food was really delicious, which says a lot considering I'm generally a pretty picky eater. We ordered three cheesecake slices to go because we couldn't decide on which one we wanted to try the most. We ordered the red velvet, white chocolate raspberry, and the Reeses peanut butter cup. The Reeses we didn't care for. The red velvet was just okay. But the white chocolate raspberry was AH-MAZING. We didn't care much for our waiter. He hardly spoke to us the entire time we were there. I believe the only time he spoke was when we were ordering, which was minimal. The rest of the time he kind of just ignored us and the rest of his tables, and stood there looking at himself in a mirror or talking to the other waiters.

Jennifer A.,"Woodland Hills, CA",401,1029,609,4.0,5/14/2012,"While some may balk at the idea of eating at the Cheesecake Factory while in Vegas, I have at least one good reason to do so. NO CALORIE COUNTS ON THE MENU!! That means, Vegas is one place where I can eat at the Cheesecake Factory with a clear conscience.  Plus they have a pretty decent happy hour that happened to be going on right when I got into town. There are a bunch of appetizers and cocktails for $5 and beers for $4. The fried mac & cheese balls are great and you can never go wrong with calamari. I was also impressed with the made to order guacamole which was a huge portion! We ended up buying more chips at Whole Foods to eat the leftovers back in our hotel room. There are also quite a few options on the small bites menu including some healthier (ahem, not fried) items like kale salad and ahi tuna.

Lara L.,"San Francisco, CA",152,42,12,4.0,10/16/2013,"It's been quite some time since I've eaten a meal at a Cheesecake Factory. I was taken out to dinner here to enjoy my first ""real"" meal after being on a very strict protein-and-pretty-much-nothing-else diet for the past two months. I didn't know what to order and ended up getting spaghetti and meat sauce. I wasn't really a fan. It was too sour and there wasn't any ""oomph"" with the flavor in the sauce or meat. As for my date's dish, he got grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Definitely looked a lot more appetizing than my spaghetti. He let me try some of the salmon and mashed potatoes. Salmon was okay. Those mashed potatoes though. Oh My God. I died. My taste buds were in heaven. The butter and the texture. The underlying kick of horseradish. I could have just eaten the mashed potatoes as my dinner. He even asked if I wanted a side of mashed potatoes to go since I was so clearly enjoying myself. I should have said yes.... hah! As for dessert, I thought about getting cheesecake, but I really wanted ice cream. I hear my date say  ""oh my god"" right before I'm greeted by a freaking goblet of chocolate ice cream with whipped cream and almonds and hot fudge. I did my happy dance while enjoying that. I do wonder if those mashed potatoes would taste different if I wasn't just coming off of a really restricted diet though. But it doesn't matter - that was a dinner date I probably won't ever forget.

Susie H.,"Las Vegas, NV",101,84,95,3.0,6/17/2013,"I've probably been to TCF dozens of times in my life. I most recently went this past weekend on Father's day. Now there's a saying - You've been to one, you've been to them all. Quite fitting here.  The service is the same at almost all locations - pretty good. I'm not a big fan of the huge menu. I know TCF is a successful restaurant chain and the big menu is part of their schtick but sometimes you just need a restaurant to be great at a few things rather than just okay on a long list of things. Plus, the endless variety of items, makes it impossible for me to narrow things down when I have no idea what I want in the first place ----but that's probably just me. I have enjoyed their Chicken Picatta almost every visit - it's my favorite thing on the menu and it has a lunch sized-portion as well. Their cocktail menu has many great items on it as well. Not a big fan of their standard margaritas though.... All in all, if you've been to cheesecake factory before and loved it, this location is very much on par with the rest of them. But if you have an option and it's a special occasion, I really hope that with all Las Vegas has to offer dining-wise, I hope you do your due diligence and branch out.

This CF is well outside of the strip area of Las Vegas and is frequented by the locals from the Green Valley area.  We came here early on a Sat. afternoon (4-ish) and the place wasn't crowded at all. Service was a tad bit slow at first but with a little prodding (and departures by other tables) our waitress picked up the pace.

Bradley T.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,1,,2.0,11/13/2012,"I visited this Cheese Cake Factory for a late lunch date.  My recommendation was a mistake. First we arrived at 2:30 PM and submitted our name to be told it would a 15 to 20 minute wait. I found that to be unacceptable considering the time of the day and considering that the restaruant was far from busy. We were finally setted and given a menu.  The waitress did arrive at our table in a timely manner.  We both ordered an Ice Tea as a beverage.  She returned timely.  We told her that we needed a few minutes to decide on lunch and she left, returning timely. My date ordered a Crab Cake appetizer, a Chicken Oriental Salad. I an old fashion Burger and Salad combo. My date told the waitress that the Crab Cakes were good, but the chicken in the salad was over cooked and very dry.  My burger was at best etable and the salad small.  So far, just lunch, not so good!    Then we were ask if we wanted dessert and my date ordered the Pumkin Spice Cheese Cake. It was delivered and as she ate the Cheese cake, I noticed a hair in it. I called the waitress over and she offered and it was accepted to get a new piece delivered. It was placed in a take home container.  It was never offered to take the item off the bill, which I felt should ahve been the case. I mean a hair in it? Issue number two.  We were never ask if we wanted a refill on our Ice Tea. although it was obvious that our glasses had been near empty throught out entree's.   So in a nutshell, we had a less than enjoyable dining experience and the tab? In my opinion, was to expensive. For a simple appetizer, oriental chicken salad. a burger and small-small salad, and two ice teas, came to $52.64.  then add a tradional tip of $12.00, it cost me $63.00 for a lunch!  I doubt that I will recommend or entertain another date at this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=400

To start off the charges us for the bread when I thought it came free with the meals but I'm not sure about that one. Also we ordered tacos and the side we decided on was rice and corn NO BEANS, and they gave us rice and beans. On that note it was also cold.. And then my dad ordered fish and chips and instead of coleslaw he asked for double fries and they didn't give him that, they gave him coleslaw...

David S.,"Las Vegas, NV",570,1050,274,2.0,4/8/2012,"I came here with two other friends to celebrate one of their birthdays. One of us does not do well with fish or anything too exotic, so the Cheesecake Factory was a safe bet.  The portions here are large, bordering on insane. Some items are average in price to quantity ratio such as the potstickers, but then there are ridiculously big selections such as their chicken nachos. We started with these two appetizers and a few drinks. Looking through their menu is daunting. Flipping through page after page, it all becomes a blur. It took us twenty minutes to settle on our meals.  Many of these plates could easily feed two and my friends did not want to split an entree with me. It definitely made me appreciate their Skinnylicious offerings. All of the items on this separate menu possessed less than 590 calories. It is not like other places that only have a few selections to choose from. No, this was a full blown menu with burgers, salads, pizzas, fish, and more. Looking at this was a task on its own. I ended up getting the Veggie Burger since I am a huge fan of beets. The patty is not like a Boca Burger. It is not condense or have the texture of meat. It is made up of farro, a wheat grain, and the deep burgundy vegetable. After a few bites, I gave up on trying to eat it as a burger and just ate the contents between the bun. It just felt odd to eat all these carbs together. The farro was cooked well and I enjoyed its flavor. It would make for a good salad.  Now comes the real reason to come to the Cheesecake Factory, it is all about their... brownies. I kid, the only reason why I still come back to this establishment is for their cheesecake. The Red Velvet is my go to dessert. The white chocolate curls on the outside makes this treat even more decadent. Too bad, cheesecake does not make for a well balanced meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=400

Andy B.,"Windermere, FL",63,278,103,4.0,10/14/2012,"We have eaten at this chain countless times - probably over 50, maybe more - the prices are very very reasonable (on entrees) and the portion sizes are huge - you really should share (especially if you want to make it to dessert). Their menu is as big as their portions - it is a ring bound folio.   We have tried a lot of the dishes and it is probably easier to list those that haven't quite lived up to expectations (as that is a shorter list): The meatloaf sandwich Their brunch menu (just order from the regular menu) Our favorite dishes are the miso salmon and the bang-bang chicken & shrimp.  My sister in law ate their calamari about 20 times on a recent vacation. Their passion fruit iced tea is great and the complimentary bread basket is excellent. Our favorite cheesecakes are the dulce de leche & pumpkin (only available for about 4 weeks a year).  The strawberry shortcake is very good if you don't feel like cheesecake.

Daniel V.,"Sparks, NV",2,17,,4.0,12/20/2011,"This may be the non-fast-food chain restaurant I have been to the most across the country and in Las Vegas in the last few years...and this location is by far my favorite. Just off the freeway in the Green Valley area of Las Vegas, lots to do in the area before or after eating, and no crazy tourists (like the one in Forum Shops) or  nouveau riche with entitlement issues (like the Summerlin location). Do I exaggerate? Yes. Is it completely untrue? No. Admit it, you've seen it on occasion if you've been to either of those other LV locations. Why return so often to this CF? Awesome food and service and rarely an unruly customer. We've visited for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner over the years and I think maybe twice there was a problem with the food, which was rectified quickly. We've been there as a party of two, with out of town friends, with a group, and each time have gone away happy.  So, consistency in quality (food and service) is one point in their favor. Another is the wide variety of menu items. Sure, there are several pages of variations on chicken, but there are also so many different meat preparations, salads, sandwiches, Asian offerings and tasty appetizers to fit the bill. A bread basket to start, and two pages of cheesecake variations to finish (key lime is #1!)...mmmm... I am a coffee snob, not so much (though a little) a chain snob, but even this is hard to find fault with at CF. Yes, it's a chain, but there are unique menu items (see other reviews, which I agree with) that other places don't have and can't reproduce in such surroundings. All that makes it kind of ""unique"" among chains and I've squared the circle as best I can here.  The reason for four rather than five stars is my own little entitled whine...bring back the Turkey Reuben, I say! Every time I ordered it, the waiter/waitress said ""great choice,"" so why did it vanish from the menu in 2009?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=400

I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp and he had a grilled cheese and fries. Both came out very fast..which is good since they have some really good bread there that can fill you up.

I am talking about LInda's Fudge Cake, the Tiramisu, the Black Out Cake. These are huge cakes, and very, very good. You just need a full day to let them thaw out as they keep them in the freezer.

Thomas H.,"Colorado City, TX",45,99,11,2.0,6/14/2015,You know for a place that charges as much as they do you would figure they could at least come out with some really good entrees. I mean I'll give it to them on the chicken pot stickers fairly tasty item but it wasn't any better than day a ghengis grill where it costs half as much right? My gf got the skinny Asian chicken which she wasn't very impressed by at all and for something on a low cal memo the peon was ridiculous but I digress. My option was the Baja chicken tacos with rice and beans again I wouldn't mind the price of the meal was worth it but the tacos and rice had no flavor and the only hot sauce the carried was Tabasco which is awful on a taco. So needles to say we were both looking for a dessert to really pull the meal together and is the cheese cake factory so hell why not we ordered an oreo cheese cake and I was really excited for it to come only to be let down I wanted to give this place one star but our server was great and very attentive so I the an extra one in for him.

For my meal, I got the regular size Miso Salmon plate for $19.95.  Start off with big serving of grilled salmon on a plateau of brown rice (or white if you prefer), surrounded by a butter sauce with pockets of sweet Miso sauce and garnished with Chinese peas.  I LOVED the Salmon.  The fish was perfectly grilled and had a wonderful light char on the skin.  The flesh was juicy and flavorful.  Great accompaniment with the Miso sauce.  I personally found that the butter sauce was waaay too rich and appreciated having the Chinese peas around to break up the monotony of  the rich butter sauce.  Other than that, the dish is on point.   The ambiance was great.  Always a vibrant atmosphere with dramatic lighting and decor.  I feel like I'm in the middle of Europe, yet not.  LOL.  This is a place you must visit once in your life.

Foodie F.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",1,37,16,4.0,6/20/2015,"I had a great experience coming here. It's such a casual restaurant that also has its own elegant flair and atmosphere.  Our waitress was very kind and helpful. I don't remember her name, but she always checked on us and was very patient with us when we couldn't decide on what to eat. The food was definitely delicious. I'm usually not fond of the entrées when I come here because 1) they're supersized and when I use them as ""leftovers"", they get soggy and I can't eat them anyway, and 2) they're usually not the best tasting even at the restaurant. However, I decided to order only small plates / appetizers to satisfy myself.  I ordered the crispy crab bites, which were decadent and had a lightly battered outside. The presentation was nice. It comes with six bites in a small skillet dish and a side of sauce and a lemon. I shared the fresh basil, tomato and mozarella flatbread with my friend. She got the beet and goat cheese salad. Overall, we finished all of the food and we were still satisfied. The appetizers, in my opinion, taste 10000x better than the entrées.  Now for the good stuff...the cheesecake. After several minutes of skimming through the endless list of various cheesecakes, I finally decided to go with Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which, in the words of the Cheesecake Factory gods, it is ""Layers of Moist Chocolate Cake, Chewy Brownie, Toasted Coconut-Pecan Frosting and Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake."" Ohhhhh yes... My lovely waitress put this in a to-go box for me, and it was fresh the whole time I ate it. It was super sweet (which I love) and the coconut paired perfectly with the decadently rich chocolate and toasted pecans. And to top it all off, the brownie and cheesecake-y cream in the center made this cheesecake - eating experience all the more better for me.

Went in tonight (party of five, two kids), service was great!  They brought out the kids meals first, no problem; then came two of the entrées, mine was still not brought out.  I ordered the Hibachi Steak (medium rare), it came out about 4 minutes after the other entrées.  The quality of the steak was aweful, very veiny with fat; also under cooked.   I buy better meat at Costco all day long.  I sent the steak back the next time the manager brought it out, same problem, it was just warmer.  The manager said that it was cooked to the internal temperature specifications to qualify it to be medium rare.  The server took one look at it, and agreed with me that it was still undercooked. They offered to redo it, or make me something else, I declined; I don't want to be the guy who sends food back just for a comped meal.  I'll go back, eventually; but I'll never order a steak there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=240

The samosas were wonderful and came with a really yummy cilantro sauce for dipping.  I could have used some more sauce though.

The overall feel of this place is great, yes it is a chain and yes they all look the same but one difference with this place in comparison to other chains is that they are always spot on with the food.  The other thing about this place is that it is obviously named due to it's insane cheesecake options but i never have room for cheesecake when we are done eating here due to the amount of food you are given when you order a normal size meal.

Linda S.,"Henderson, NV",1687,192,645,4.0,4/2/2013,"It's really hard NOT to love Cheesecake Factory. This place has been an old favorite from years ago. The food is usually consistent for the most part and the portions could feed a small  village. What fluctuates seems to be service. Tonight wasn't bad as we had a newbie who had some things to learn but very polite. Funny how I sometimes expect a certain level of service at established restaurants and forget that every server has to start somewhere. After limiting myself to one slice of their signature warm brown bread, I feasted on the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. My fave! Large shrimp in a flavorful, Jamaican jerk-like sauce alongside white rice, fruity mango salsa, black beans and sweet plantains. I was a little piggy and ate all the succulent shrimp...because I could :) The sauce was plenty if you want to mix your rice into it. The other item ordered at our table that I usually get was the Crusted Chicken Romano in a creamy white Alfredo sauce (not tomato as it shows on menu...get the white, it's better) Served with pasta. Love how thin and crispy the chicken was in the Romano cheese crust. I recommend getting the sauce on the side or separating the chicken to keep it from getting soggy. We also like the frozen mango raspberry smoothie that is just like taking a bite of fresh ripe mango. Very refreshing but will fill you up. I don't recall having a bad meal here and the great part is there's something for everyone in your group and again portion sizes are big enough to share or take home for another meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=340

I hate restaurants that are so loud that I can't talk to the person sitting in front or next to me. Plus the tables are way to close together so it feels like I am sitting with strangers.

It's almost as if I am eating there in the restaurant with the temperature and etc. The food is always on point. Food Chicken Samosas - 5 Stars - Full of Flavor, Nice Portion size, Sauce is to die for. Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls - 3.5 Stars - The filling needs more seasoning before being wrapped in the rice paper. The sauces can only go so far in seasoning the rolls. Bread - 5 Star plus - Enjoy the 9 grain bread the most. Shrimp & Bacon Club - 5 Stars - Love the bacon, shrimp and the sauce. I don't put tomatoes on the sandwich but sub onions and the flavor is so much better.  Fries - Always seasoned wel. Sometimes a little too well.

From Los Angeles to Las Vegas, I have eaten my way across state borders via Cheesecake Factories. First thing is that this place doesn't take reservations but a table for 2-4 people averages at 15 to 20 minutes of wait time. That's reasonable on a Saturday night, most restaurants are terrible with wait times. Ordered the Four Cheese Pasta with Chicken and the Red Velvet Cheescake for dessert. Two words: REALLY GOOD. The portions are huge and really you can split it between two people. I had a ton of leftovers for later. Service was fast and good, the inside of the restaurant is classy and nice, no complaints.

My daughter  chose this as her 11th birthday dinner location. We've always enjoyed their food and of course the cheesecake. We had a party of 9 on a Friday night. I called early in the week in attempts of making a reservation but they do not take them on weekends.  That was my 1st and main disappointment. I didn't want to have a large group (half kids) waiting long. I told my party to arrive at 7, I arrived about 15 min prior. Our total wait time ended up being about 25 minutes. Not too bad on a Friday night.  We were sat at a beautiful big round table where everyone could see everyone.  We ordered multiple apps and dishes including spinach dip, calamari, tex mex egg rolls, chicken picatta, garlic noodles, sliders, steak, shrimp, and more.  Everything food wise was 4 stars easy. It did take a full on hour before we were eating though. They served us basket upon basket of bread but took forever on the real food.  Service was 3 stars. Our waitress was nice, just overworked and slow.  Cheesecake selections were red velvet, Oreo, Hershey's, and strawberry.  Seriously can I say anything wrong? Of course not.  I will return to Cheesecake Factory. Overall they are a great ""chain"" restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=380
Mai G.,"Henderson, NV",1,58,,4.0,1/18/2015,"I've eaten here a few times the past few years. It's not really a go to place because it's a little pricey. Usually I eat here either to catch up with friends, or if guests staying over wants to try it.  My experience overall has always been good with no complaints on service.  Though their menu is vast I think the entrees seem a bit boring. There seems to be more chicken entrees than anything else. I ordered a chicken shrimp jambalaya. It was good and they were generous with shrimp. Perfect meal for people who likes spice and who's not afraid of carbs. How can you not leave this place and not order a cheesecake? Well I did that. Between the appetizers and my entree I was way too stuff to order one. It's ok.

We assumed she did that for a tip because she did it right in the middle of us signing the check. Ugh that really bothers me.  We are always nice to our servers and we are not hard to please. I wish I could say that maybe she just had a long day but she told us that she just got there and she was taking over our table from the other waitress who's shift was ending and I have to say she was so much nicer at the end of a shift than our new waitress at the beginning of her shift.

Huge menu and portions, friendly service, food typically delivered to the table quickly and as ordered, and a lot of dessert choices...of course! The addition a while back of the Skinnylicious menu is appreciated; we often choose one appetizer and one main course and split the two as our lunch.  Then a slice of cheesecake to go for breakfast the next morning. Drink prices (especially the bellini or other speciality options) are ridiculously expensive so we tend to shy away from the adult beverages.

We went for lunch it was pretty busy but we got sat immediately.They accommodated the whole family as far as seating including my newborn which some restaurants do not have proper seating for. As I'm looking through the menu I see a wide variety of different options they have a pretty big menu! My mother in law ordered appetizers she ordered two different artichoke dishes one was the fire roasted fresh artichoke and the other was fried artichoke I'd never tried it so id figure what the hell ill try it. Hmmm I guess I'm not a fan of artichoke I didn't like it at all yuck which sucks because there were a lot of different appetizers that sounded tasty that i would have ordered such as avocado eggrolls, chicken pop stickers, fried Mac and cheese, tex mex eggrolls,crab wontons or the crab cakes hmm I might have to come here and just order appetizers one day lol. Now for my main dish I decided to stick with what I remember ordering and liking years ago the fettuccine Alfredo I did the lunch special since pasta is filling I ordered the tropical tea to go with it. The fettuccine was ok not great just ok I remember it being better but I guess they changed the ingredients, the tea was refreshing and delicious. My hubster and mother in law were happy with their dishes my hubster got the BBQ hamburger and she got some type of salad.  It pains me to rate it 3 stars because I'm pretty sure if I had ordered something else and a different appetizer it would of been 4 stars because the service was awesome and I just chose the wrong dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=360

We went as a big group and sat at a round table.Our server was cordial and attentive and as a former CCF employee I know the whole drill they must do. She missed a couple of things here and there but who cares...I never agreed with their long introduction anyways. Our order placement was simple and it went smooth..for the most part. She forgot to take my order and had to call her back ..no biggie it happens to be best. I really liked the fact that they have a Skinny ""B"" menu (as my gay best friend calls it) and I can get some very tasty food without feeling like I will end up like Jabba the Hutt. I had the tartar and it was delicious, fresh and tasty! Small yes..but that's the price of low calories. To close my meal I ordered the margaretha flat bread and it was delicious as well.. after eating my stuff of course I started eating my friends food and had a taste of the HUGE nachos..and when I say huge I really mean it..that was a mega plate ..priced very good as well! Salads were big and tasty! In general, CCF always tastes good , from its bread to the desert. Our server was super nice and attentive.she even split the bill in 8 without a single issue. I really liked that touch. As long as there is not a long waiting time (which there usually is) I will continue to come to their spot due the ambiance, music ,service and of course food.

Well, Cheesecake Factory, you've disappointed me by NOT quoting me wait times. I guess you can't please everybody and in this case I am the one not pleased.

Christy D.,"Las Vegas, NV",155,95,19,4.0,7/2/2012,"Went here just a couple of days ago for my first time. i'll start out with the service first. Our waitress was friendly, funny and on the ball! There was never a moment during our entire meal that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a drink or help us. And I also want to make note of the fact that each waiter/waitress was dressed in white from head to toe and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each person was dressed perfectly without a stain or blemish on their clothing. And for anyone that has worked in food service you know this isn't an easy thing to do.  We ordered appetizers to start out the meal, crab wontons and the warm crab artichoke dip. OMG let me tell you what both of the appetizers were amazing. The crab artichoke dip was perfectly hot temp wise, seasoned perfectly and there were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also came out a perfect temp and that pop of fresh green onion flavor combined with the sweet spicy dipping sauce was to die for.  My husband ordered the filet mignon, it came with sweet potato fries, onion rings and he added a side of steamed asparagus. I myself ordered the factory combo that came with the steak diane, shrimp scampi and their house mashed potatoes. For me the steak was tasty and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was a tad over cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not that it was awful, just could have been better. Now the mashed potatoes, sweet baby jesus these things were delightful, they used red potatoes and there were still nice random lumps of potato throughout which I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just couldn't stop eating them. My husband said that his filet was perfectly cooked and that his whole meal was tasty, he even proclaimed that it was one of the best filet's he's ever had.  Now for the cheesecake he ordered the lemon raspberry and I got the red velvet. Let me tell you what that red velvet cheesecake is amazing, I have an affinity for anything red velvet and am quite stringent on my standards of a good red velvet. The cake itself was moist and tasty and when surrounded by layers of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff is the business. I would go back just for the cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=420

We ordered the flat bread with pears, blue cheese, pecans, and baby spinach. It was good but the portion was pretty small. We also ordered the herb crusted salmon salad. I expected the salmon to be warm but it came out cold. Most salmon salads I'm used to the salmon is nice and warm and cooked medium but it seems like cheese cake factory's salmon was pre-cooked, over cooked and sat in a refrigerator until served.

Chad B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,1,4.0,8/5/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites across the board due to the consistency of the food and service. Tonight I ordered the fried cheese starter platter, soup du jour (tortilla), and the Chicken and Biscuit entree. Let me start off but saying the fried cheese was excellent, about 8 little triangles perfectly breaded and crisped with Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses and melted to perfection. They were the perfect temperature. The soup was so-so, a basic bisque like consistency with corn and some other veggies. It had a nice spicy finish but at first bite the saltiness is a little  overwhelming. The entree is one of my favorite a good solid buttermilk biscuit, very flaky and buttery, with a vegetable melange (carrots were slightly undercooked) , mushrooms, and peas. The chicken however was moist and juicy, pan seared to perfection. It also had just the right amount of rosemary crust. And the gravy that they use is fantastic, not to rich or thick, and not overly seasoned. That's what I like about this entree it's not overly done so you can really enjoy each component.

Roy D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,22,14,2.0,5/10/2015,"Good food, lousy service. If the server is named Stephanie L., ask for another server or risk getting the poor service we received.  We visited on a busy Mothers' Day weekend and the service was sub-standard. First, the server forgot our appetizer and brought it out only after we asked in confusion because our main entrées came out while we we waited for the fried calamari. Second, no refills were offered for our soda. Third, our take-home boxes was missing one of the entrées which probably didn't get boxed in confusion. Finally, I realized that the Cheesecake Factory is one of those establishments that calculates the customary 15% gratuity on the dinner + the tax instead of correctly on just the dinner itself. Anyone of these service issues by themselves would not have been a big deal, but all of them combined made our dining experience less than special for us.

Then the food was better than usual, not sure if choices or chef of the day but food was good. I had BBQ chicken salad which is my fave at a competing restaurant, I liked it better here! He had some kind of chicken and shrimp in a warm PB sauce (I can't remember name) and he loved it. Then I don't like cheesecake but I eat the Adams peanut butter usually, Joe reccommended the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake and it was decadent! He had red velvet as his fave!  The best part was the managers or owners or something were meeting with the chefs across from us and they kept saying how cute and wonderful my daughter is. That is the truth!

K S.,"Henderson, NV",0,8,,1.0,11/30/2014,"We have visited the Henderson, NV location many times since 2007 and I have to say that tonight was the last straw. Our server, Deanna displayed unprofessional and inexcusable behavior towards my husband and I as well as our 4 guests. After we were seated we were greeted by our sever who unfortunately was about to leave for the day. She introduced Deanna as our new server while she made sure we had plenty to drink before she left. Deanna proceeded to take our food order and was very vocal when our friends ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with an extra order of fries. They told her that they were sharing the sandwich to which Deanna replied loudly ""that's it ? You're sharing a sandwich?"" She seemed irritated and it continued when my husband and I ordered the crusted chicken romano with a salad to share. She commented again ""you're sharing too?"" Then to cap it off when our friend's 5 year old told her father that she wasn't hungry she stated ""so she isn't eating anything!""  Honestly, I found her behavior apalling and I have no problem taking my business to Lucille's and/or Claim Jumpers which are both just across the street. The food here is good but I don't need to be shamed for sharing a dinner that is actually large enough for 3 people.

When I inquired about it, they said that they change their menus all the time.  It may be back.  They also mentioned that it was their most requested item off the old menu, which doesn't make any sense. This four-star review reflects their current menu options...if they ever decide to bring them back, the beef ribs make it an easy 5 stars. Also, be sure to check out their strawberry lemonade...it's served with sugar around the rim, and it's deliciously sweet and refreshing.  Seriously the best strawberry lemonade I've tasted (comparable to Lucille's Smokehouse, which is also pretty damn good).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=420

There was so much that I could only eat half my dinner. The Thai pasta.. I have to confess I kept stealing bites of my roommates dinner. The texture was good, the mix of flavors was just amazing ... I think I found a new favorite dish. I think my roommate was wishing she had ordered something else after I kept trying to distract her so I could steal bites. We drank the Passion Iced Tea. It was really complimentary to the meal.  Our server kept the glasses filled and even brought a huge glass of ice when ours melted too fast.  Then we ordered CHEESECAKE... She ordered the Tuxedo cheesecake . I tried a bite and the rich chocolate is definitely going to fit on my schedule from now on.

Angel L.,"Henderson, NV",1,17,,2.0,4/2/2015,"I want to start out by saying I LOVE the cheesecake factory. I would give the one in Anaheim, CA (in the Gardenwalk) 5 stars. With that said, I give this specific establishment 2 stars. The service is a hit or miss. Sometimes you will get a server that is right on point but most the time the servers are ""ok."" The food gets screwed up at this place on a regular basis. One of the mess ups out of many was burned French fries. At an establishment like this I expect high standards. First off the cook was a jerk for even putting it out there to be served. Second the waitress failed by bringing it to us after clearly seeing that it was burned. We had to tell her they were burned (it was obvious) and she didn't even apologize or seem sympathetic she just said ok i'll get you another one, in a quick fast tone. If you alter a dish, they will bring it to you wrong. And i'm not talking about an extreme alteration. I'm talking about asking for a different type of pasta vs. the one it comes with. If they mess up your dish it will come back more screwed up as if to punish you for having the audacity to correct the mistake. Take out is always a guarantee mess up and they always give you less food when you do take out vs. when you sit inside. I am speaking from 3 years of experience with this place. If you can, go to the one in Summerlin they are much better and more on target. its really sad that such an awesome establishment is screwed up and nothing is done to rectify it. I'm not going to list all the messed up incidents from this place because it will turn into a novel. Its a great food chain with wonderful food. There is something for everyone here and you will not be disappointed with the taste of your food, when made properly. I know a lot of flack is given to this place for the high fat and calorie content. I really don't think that people are looking at it from the proper perspective. You need to know they give you huge portions here. The fat and calorie content is based on the huge plate of food you receive. This place is giving you all this food with the intent of being able to have the consumer bring some home for later. You cant possible think that you are supposed to eat all that food in one sitting. The food you get on your plate is way more then what you would get on the appetizer plate. Appetizers are meant to serve 2-4 people and your entrée contains more food then that. So I will leave you with that food for thought ;). If you eat the proper portion its really not that bad in fat and calories. Have you ever seen the fat and calories in a marie calendars frozen meal at the grocery store?! Just think, the portion in a Marie Calendar's frozen meal is 1/3 to 1/4 less then what you would receive on your plate at The Cheesecake factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=440

I'm totally not a hater (okay... well, in this case, maybe I am a little bit)... but when you live in a foodies paradise, is that the best you can do? Anyhoo... I pull into the parking lot and there's a Semi Limo (as in, truck in the front, limo in the back) in the parking lot. Immediate thought: only in Vegas.... maybe I will be surprised. And, surprised I was. I went for the Spicy Chicken Salad (sub-ing the bird for the shrimp) and was surprised at the freshness of the mixed greens, the bite in the peppers and the distinctiveness of the cilantro. The spicy vinaigrette was also a nice touch. This salad was not the type that would have been made in the Cheesecake Factory I remembered.  Can I give CF higher than 3 stars? No, not when there are so many other fabulous restos in this city.

Jessie B.,"Henderson, NV",75,776,124,5.0,8/2/2010,"July 30th is National Cheesecake Day. What better way to celebrate this surely made-up holiday then by meeting some friends at The Cheesecake Factory? That is exactly what I did this past Friday. My group was made up of a coworker, his wife, their 2 year old son, and another coworker. Two of us arrived first, we decided to start out in the bar area because it was happy hour. $5 drinks!  Despite the crowd, we were seated within about 10 minutes from arrival. Our server, Paul, greeted us with an ""Aloha!"" and brought out waters and some bread for us to munch on while we waited for the rest of our group.  Once the rest of our group arrived, Paul came back over to see if we had any questions. A member of our group asked him for his personal suggestions and he rattled off his favorites for all parts of the menu, from salads to pasta to fish dishes.  Anyone that has been to The Cheesecake Factory knows that the menu is like a short novel, I was impressed with how knowledgeable Paul was about everything on the menu.  Since some of us were hungry and others were more interested in drinks and desert (namely, me!), we ended up splitting a few appetizers between the group, and then two people ordered entrees as well. First appetizer choice was avocado egg rolls. This is my must-order item at Cheesecake Factory, nothing compares to their avocado egg rolls. We also had the crab cakes and the sweet corn tamale cakes. They were all excellent.  Finally it was desert time. Since it was National Cheesecake Day, all slices were half price. Bonus! I ordered my usual, a slice of the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. It is unbelievable, the tartness of the lemon and raspberry are the perfect compliment to the sweet creaminess of the cheesecake. Paul ended up being the icing on the cake, the reason a 4 star review became a 5 star one. He was an exceptional server, he always seemed to know when to come check on us, and when to leave us alone. A member of our group was so pleased with the service he waited after paying the bill to speak to the manager and let him know just how happy he was to have had Paul serve us.  Will I be back?

Sam N.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,28,192,1.0,11/19/2012,"First off, I'm a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory and have been eating at different ones religiously throughout the years, but my experience at this location was a gigantic disappoint, to say the least.  When I suggested The Cheesecake Factory to one of my friends, he said that the food wasn't great and overpriced at that. Since this has always been one of my favorite places to go, of course I had to argue with him. Determined to prove him wrong, I insisted that we go here for dinner. We went in, put our name down on the wait list, and went outside for a cigarette. Now this is a normal practice, and typically restaurant hosts will always check outside for the next table to be seated if nobody answers their call from inside, especially if the waiting area inside is full! They didn't even try to look for us when we were literally standing just outside of the door (which we had also let the hostess know before stepping out), and it took a leaving customer to inform us that we were up for a table. We ended up having to sit outside because they sat somebody else at our table. Our waitress was friendly (which was the only pro of the night). I ordered a rare steak Diane and herb crusted salmon. When the food came out, my steak was COLD. Not even room temperature, but cold. When I informed our waitress, she had the audacity to tell me that in order for them to cook it rare, they could only throw it on the grill for a couple seconds which meant that it was normal for it to be cold. Are you seriously kidding me? I don't ever eat anything BUT rare steak, and I have yet gone to a restaurant and been served a cold one. Furthermore, if you don't know how the steak Diane at The Cheesecake Factory is, the steak is actually thinly sliced into little pieces, about three inches in diameter. So it doesn't take much for the meat to get heated up. As a reference, I have ordered this dish before at several other Cheesecake Factories, and not once have I encountered this problem.  At this point I was just bummed out, but my friend insisted on complaining to the manager, so that's who we asked for. It was a good 15 minutes before anybody walked past us or any of the tables around. We had to asked for a manager twice before our waitress came back with my steak re-cooked. The manager lingered in the background behind her and they both left after she gave me my steak. At this point we just asked for the check and a to-go box since our appetites were gone. I didn't even bother checking my steak to see if it was any good this time around. I didn't bother mentioning, but my herb crusted salmon was exceptionally bland. I had to season the life into it with salt and pepper myself. At least it was decently cooked, and with how they treated my steak, I didn't even want to complain about anything else. I don't remember what my date had to eat, but it's safe to say that we were just as impressed with his dish as we were with mine, which was not at all. I'm a very easy-going and forgiving person, so for me the big issue isn't necessarily the poor cooking, but the service and management (as I've seen other reviewers have pointed out). They should have just fixed the problem when it was presented, instead of making excuses. We were not being rude or unfriendly (in fact quite the opposite, despite of everything) and it's not like I was asking for the meal to be comped or discounted. In addition, I've never seen worse management skills. The manager never bothered to introduce himself or ask us how we were doing, even though we had specifically asked for him. Everything was a huge hassle and they made me feel like I was someone who was super picky or asking too much. My friend is right in that The Cheesecake Factory is a relatively pricey place to eat and based on my experience at this location, it is definitely not worth it. Worst $50 of my life, which doesn't even include tax and tip. It's a good thing our waitress was at least friendly and smiled through the night, because her other service skills were quite lacking. I don't even know how the manager was hired, because he showed no managerial skills whatsoever. I was so embarrassed that I insisted on going to eat here and defended this place when everything turned out to be horrible.  This particular Cheesecake Factory is definitely not up to par. Avoid at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=460

Michael H. was an awesome server, he was very helpful & attentive. It took us a few minutes to figure out what we wanted- & he was very patient. Not to mention, he kept our glasses filled with water the entire meal...which is quite a feat, considering we drink like fish.  Shrimp Scampi Crostini- excellent, very rich in flavor & THICK for a ""small plate"".  White Bean Hummus- very refreshing, I think I might even prefer it prepared with white beans as opposed to chickpeas.  The red velvet cheesecake was TO DIE FOR. My goodness!

I'm sorry but stale cold nachos with stringy and chewy cheese is just unacceptable. I'm sure it doesn't take long to make a good hot plate of cheesy melty hot and creamy nachos right to order....so why not of made it a la minute before making the other entrees and having the runner bring it out when it was hot and ready to go? Or perhaps it was the runner's delay of bringing the food?

C L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,1.0,9/7/2013,"I'm giving one star strictly based on service. The food is great.  I had just moved to Las Vegas from California and have eaten at multiple Cheesecake Factory locations on many different occasions.  We decided to eat in the bar area rather than wait for a table. We sat down and our server, Melissa N., came up after a few minutes and took our drink orders but didn't ask us if we wanted to eat (we ordered 3 waters and a lemonade). She brought back our waters and walked away. We tried to flag her down for menus but she never stopped. One of us went to the host stand and got menus, 10 minutes later she came back and we placed our order and asked about the lemonade and she said she'd bring it right back and did.  While we were waiting for our food she brought us bread however she forgot bread plates and place settings. We waited for a few minutes and didn't see her so we asked another server if we could have silverware and she promptly returned with silverware, napkins, and bread plates.  Our dinner arrived via food runners and upon inspection 1 of the 3 salads had dressing and one of the sandwiches had mushrooms when we requested there were none. We waited and waited, no Melissa, so we stopped a host who was walking by if she could find her. She finally appeared and delivering another tables food and one of us had to walk after her because she never even checked on us.  She apologized for the mushrooms and said she'd have another one sent right out and also said she'd bring the dressing right back, ""I'll be right back with your balsamic"" however, I previously had asked for ranch.  It took another 10-15 minutes for someone to tell us that the sandwich was almost done. It was a manager and I asked for it to be packaged to-go because everyone was already done eating. We told him about the utter lack of service and he apologized and offered to buy us desert, we accepted. Melissa came back with the sandwich packaged to-go and asked what kind of deserts we'd like, we told her and requested no whipped cream be put on the cheesecake.  She said she'd get them packaged up for us and left the bill. The manager was kind enough to comp the meal but only comped one of the slices of cheesecake after he offered to buy it for us.  We paid the bill and Melissa returned with our cheesecakes, of course one had whipped cream. I would NEVER recommend this location to anyone strictly based on service, the food quality and portions are great but the service is absolutely dismal.  Sherman Oaks, Woodland Hills, Glendale, Redondo Beach, and Thousand Oaks are a few of the Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to and I'd give all of these locations 5 stars all the way around and have no hesitation recommending them to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=460

The menu here offers a huge variety. I ventured away from my usual favorite entrées (Meat loaf, asian or one of the pasta dishes) and tried the jambalaya pasta. The flavor was delicious but the chicken was dry,  as was the entire dish. It was probably overcooked. The flavor was so good that I may try it again after getting the waiter's opinion about the norm for this dish.  About the waiter,  he did a great job despite a very busy night.

Nic D.,"Bullhead City, AZ",0,3,,1.0,5/28/2015,"Went to this place for lunch and what a mistake that was. I ordered the gluten free skinny ceasar salad. I was happy they had an option for me. I received my salad and 3 bites in I found a BUG in my salad. I was shocked and disgusted. The waiter was shocked as well and took my salad. About 5 minutes later the manager came over and gave me a fake smile and apology that was very procedural. She offered me something else but why on earth would I want anything else from this place. I am very limited as to what I eat and this was one of the only options for me. I sure didn't want another salad with BUGS in it. Yes, I get it- it's lettuce and bugs like lettuce but they should be washing their lettuce more thoroughly to avoid this disgusting situation. I had to sit the rest of the meal while others in the party ate their meals which were not salad. As a person in customer service, the manager did not go out of her way to rectify the situation. She could have offered a discount on the rest of the bill. She took the salad off the bill but of course she would, I did not eat it and this was their fault. When we left the same manager was standing near the exit and she turned her back when she saw us leaving. Did not say another word to us. This is horrible customer service at it's finest. I will not ever go back to this place and urge others to be aware of the BUGS in the salad. To all the restaurants out there, when it is your fault someone's meal goes terribly wrong it is your responsibility to make things right. Had they discounted the rest of the bill or heck even offered to cover the bill themselves maybe I wouldn't have written this review!

Jaime W.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,25,,4.0,1/28/2013,"I took my mom here for her birthday  because she had never been and she's a Big Bang fanatic, so she had to go ""visit"" Penny. When we arrived we only had to wait 10 mins, but once our name was called there was a sea of people that filled the front. So I'm guessing it's a great idea to call ahead. service was fast. Our server Daniel was very nice and poise, looked like he had been serving for years. We started with a CUP of soup, it looked like a regular soup bowl. By the time out entrees arrived, we could barely eat. good thing, because i was so0o disappointed in how my entree tasted. I order a Smokehouse Burger, and it was so0 dry and bland =[ I figured i was a bit out of it, and my taste buds just weren't awake after that AMAZING clam chowder, but no. I brought it all home to my Hubby, and he was confused on when he was going to get some flavor. I don't know if it was an off dish or what, but next time I'm ordering a steak or some pasta, and if they can't get one of those tasting great, then Cheescake Factory will only be for Soup & Cheescake for this family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=500
Tom W.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,65,2,3.0,8/21/2010,Overdone and half baked concept food fare fosters a large belly with a check of equal size for what is now average food at a big box food factory.

Russell A.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,8,5,4.0,3/7/2010,"Some people go here just for the dessert and I cant blame them. ADAMS PEANUT BUTTER CUP FUDGE RIPPLE was honestly a harmonious blend of peanut butter and chocolate. Neither too strong or too soft, just good.  That's what we ate the next day. At home. Because I couldn't bring myself to even attempt the cheesecake, after the buffet we had at the restaurant.  We went unannounced on Valentine's night. The wait was an hour which was understandable.  AVOCADO EGG ROLLS and FRIED MACARONI & CHEESE.  Sound like a lot? No, me either, but I couldn't finish my meal. So I guess it was. We really underestimated those appetizers, because I'm dumb. And honestly that could've been our meal. And I don't why but I keep trying to find a suitable mac and cheese, but I guess I just like it simple. Because anything too fancy just doesn't do it. For me. CAJUN PASTA JAMBALAYA  was the dish across, and the SHRIMP SCAMPI & SALMON was the dish in front. Of me that is.  I know what shrimp and salmon taste like, but That salmon was perfect. Enough for me to mention it again here, I was just pleasantly surprised. Even with how full I was, I dominated that thing. Like a duck. (No chewing) If you've never been, then you should, at least once. It's one of those places that you wish you could call it you're favorite restaurant (because of the decor, the ambiance, the food) but then you see the people you're eating around with, because you decided not to get a booth. And sad face.  But it stills bare mention though, it's just not a place you want to go all the time. Just once in awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=500
Jamie T.,"Henderson, NV",300,7,,1.0,6/9/2013,"The only reason why I put one star is because the cheesecake is phenomenal. Me and my bf dined there one night he got the mac n cheese burger and I got like a western one , our server I think her name was Amanda talk blonde girl , never checked up on us and I watched every one else that was sat after us get there food and we sat for about 2 more hours with no food other parties that were there after us left already , then one guy comes up to us apologizing about the food delay , and that he would take care of it , well then the food came and finally.our server comes back apologizing for it taking forever , well the burgers were gross over Cooked, Mac n cheese was dry with rubbery noodles , we didn't even finish it , then we get the bill and we got no discount no nothing , they didn't take care of us at all , we paid the bill and left and will never be dining in there again ever just going in to get  cheesecake to go for now on.

Joanna F.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,30,79,1.0,5/4/2012,"I've been here 3 times before this last time. On August of 2011 I went to Cheesecake Factory with my family for my mother birthday (10) people. I understand that this place does get busy and there was going to be a wait. So they told us it'll be a hour wait which we were fine with. An hour past we still waited 2 hours are creeping by so we ask if our table was ready, no not yet. Still waiting and now 5 kids are getting inpatient and crying they are hungry. Now Im getting upset and whats taking so long to get a table. It seem as if they didn't care I had to ask for a manager to get anything done. The manager did try to make the situation better by comp some food but the damage was done for a 2 hrs and so wait. I with to order a cheesecake for my mother and some man that work there made a comment that I had to pay for that. I just brush it off and reply I know that. I will never return to this or any cheesecake factory. The service was bad and made to feel as dirt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=500

mvc j.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,145,,2.0,3/4/2010,"I can see how this would be a very popular restaurant - nice bar, large menu with lots of options and good cheesecake. My experience has been that the cheesecake here is good for dessert.  Fresh, well made, lots of options and flavors, etc.... Bar is good too with good beer and drink options (Fat Tire on tap is always a plus). Overall design of the restaurant is pleasant, albeit a bit loud due to very high ceilings. I just always find the menu, which is very large and varied in options and cuisine types, to be very middle of the road for the actual food.  Maybe because this restaurant tries to offer something for everybody - in my opinon, it results in lighty seasoned food (in large portions, in my opinion, that is not objectionable to anyone but just not that interesting. I did want to really like this restaurant (not typically a huge chain fan, but really like The District and all it offers), but based on my few visits here, I would have a drink or dessert here, but find the main meal options lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=500
Scott E.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,4,,4.0,10/24/2012,"We don't go here a ton but it is an every other month restaurant for us. Typically I can't finish my entire meal as the portions are huge and if I want cheesecake then I have to save room. The service is typically adequate to very good, but compared to the Plaza branch I'm used to in KC, MO it is missing a little bit of charm.  A few things I was very happy to see on this trip (October) were firstly a very expansive healthy menu that filled all of mine and my wife's needs and secondly a new cheesecake that was made to have hints of pumpkin pie. Both were welcome additions and both were full of very tasty bites!!  Things that would make this a more regular trip to me and my wife....more draft beer choices and super cold iced draw glasses, and lastly more intimate seating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-henderson?start=500
