Liz T.,"San Francisco, CA",1349,527,368,4.0,4/20/2008,"Avoid it like the plague on Friday/Saturday nights unless you eat dinner at 4PM--the long wait can reach ridiculousness (i.e. 2 hours). I come for lunch because my fuse is too short for the line and the lunch specials are perfect in portion and price. The Avocado Eggrolls and the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls (make sure to tell the server you don't like your fish overcooked) are just deelish. It's bizarre for me to rave about Asian-inspired food at chain restaurants, but these are rare cases. And I don't care if this place is a chain, I can't afford to eat at Alan Wong's all the time. The dish I order on every visit is the Pasta Da Vinci (sauteed chicken, shittake mushrooms, caramelized onions, Madeira wine, penne pasta). It's FAMAZING! I try to bypass the cheesecake. Like Prince William they're rich and delicious, but they're around 1,000 calories per SLICE! I don't know about you, but I rather have 4 Subway sandwiches. Who needs dessert when the waiters are so sweet-looking anyway?

I had pulled pork sandwich, it was huge.  I could not eat everything.  (honestly the pulled pork is better at a resturant called Ilikai bar and Grill check my review for there) but generally was really good.  Yes the cheesecake was $7.50  but it was a big piece and excellent.  The price of the meal,  beer and cheesecake still so reasonable.   loved it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1340
Angry K.,"San Jose, CA",122,66,,2.0,3/4/2009,"Tips for you - ONLY go to Cheesecake Factory to have the cheesecake, and get take out if you can. That would be the only reason that you could like the place. Why do so many people wait to get into this place, when the average wait is 45-60 minutes? I don't understand it. I know it's a Hawaii thing to hype up places that we didn't have here before but the mainland does, but come on! The food sucks. Sorry to say that. I've had multiple meals there - chicken chops or something? That are supposed to be like pork chops? Dry. Disgusting.  Salads? Overpriced for what you get. Other food I have gotten there is forgettable. And completely overpriced for the quality of food. You can get better food at the food court at Ala Moana, and spend only about 1/3. Service? Meh. Seriously, sometimes the waiters don't even come back to check on you and see ""how things are"". I think that's a pretty standard thing, don't you? I don't care if you're busy, come back and check on me if you want a decent tip! Cheesecake of course is great, but that is the only redeeming quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1340

Price/Quantity/Quality : Been to other places in the area but this one was good, when you compare to price and the quality & quantity which is offered. Delicious food, whichever we ordered. Ambiance : The best seats are the one facing the street. No food is good until you eat in the ambiance you prefer. Full of people and lot of things going on, look around and easily accessible place. PS: If you looking for a place to relax and don't want to miss the streets of Honolulu, dine at evenings there. Service : All the three attendants were good, courteous and quick in their service.

Roxanne H.,"Sydney, Australia",3,44,73,4.0,1/13/2013,"Well Folks over the many years that we have holidayed in Honolulu we have always managed to have at least one meal at this restaurant while we have been there. Yes it is predictable and yes it is very American but that is the thing that makes it a good place when you cannot be bothered going anywhere else, put your name down they give you the buzzer to tell you when your table is ready and you wander off . This was lunch on our first day in Waikiki, sleep deprived from the  long flight from Sydney and waiting for our room to be ready, what better way to fill in the time than to have a bite. But I write this to tell you that yes the food which as I said is predictable but it was the really great service that stood out that day. Natalie our waitress was what you wish every waitress to be,  so much so that my husband asked for the manager to tell him so, OK and yes the food was great especially after a night of airline economy class food.yes the servings are huge,  we always share.. but can I add that we visited three times this trip  and finally tried yes wait for it... cheesecake... the first time... so my all time favorite has to be   lime.... delicious and peanut butter cheesecake  again we all shared (three of us) very rich and no way I could have eaten any one of these by myself.

I ordered the club sandwich which you would think would be super easy to make not really any cooking involved but it came 5 mins after my husband and son's food did. So when they finally brought it out the server had written down my order wrong and it had to be taken back to be remade which by the time they finally got it right my family was already done eating so I decided that I did not want the sandwich ( I am kinda stubborn) they did try to make it right and somehow managed to bring out a total of 3 club sandwiches before we left with one being the way I wanted it. To make it right the manager came over talked to me said he would take care of it (which he did) we then proceeded to order cheesecake (my husband and I shared my son got his own) the server came back over and informed us mine was free we thanked her got a to go box and left.

And despite the fact that we had to wait an hour or so before being seated and walk what seemed like half a mile from their validated parking gargage just to get there, it was still good. Maybe not worth the wait...or the walk...but good. My suggestions would be to have a friend drop you off if you're planning on eating any later than 7PM and make sure your phone is fully charged so you can play games or browse the internet because chances are you're gonna wait.

I was expecting good desserts, but they (and the entrees) far surpassed by expectations. I had the Sante Fe salad (lunch portion - still too huge to finish), and it was very flavorful. One of my friends had chicken piccata, which looked delish. I saw calamari at a couple of other tables, and it looked wonderful, so I'll have to try that next time. The four of us split Chocolate Tuxedo and Red Velvet cheesecake for dessert. They were both so tasty, we were all moaning with pleasure. We thought we'd have to wait because we were there at about 1:00 on 4th of July weekend, but the wait was minimal - only about 5 minutes, I think. Our server (Aaron?) was delightful and funny.

Eve B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,1.0,11/1/2010,"It is Halloween night in Waikiki and been trying to get a dinner reservation to eat dinner here since Friday. They refuse to take phone reservation so they advise you to go personally. As a LOCAL and new transplant from the mainland, my husband and I decided to go tthere personally and make reservation. We show up and was told that they could not give us reservation way ahead of time since it is for Sunday. The girl told me to come back on Sunday and get reservation anytime  of the  day. I said okay. Today Sunday at 1130 AM, we show up to make reservation and we were denied again. We were told they will not take reservations period. I asked for the Manager. My husband and I spoke to the Manager and he told  us to come back between 5:30-6:00 pm tonight and there should not be a problem getting a dinner reservation . We showed up at the appointed time of 5:45pm and were  again DENIED. Unbelievable. I have never experienced this in my entire life!!!  My blood pressure is now sky rocketing. I told the girl in the front that I had spoken with the  day manager, described his appearance. She told Me that there are 4 managers with the same appearance. She IMPLIED AND made me feel like I was lying. That I DID NOT appreciate. I asked for the  Manager to clear up this mess.  We spoke to a JT and would not  honor my plea. I described to him again that I had spoken to the day manager, described to him what he looked like.  He then confirmed that such manager does exist, but JT was no help other than it will probably take 3 hours before we are seated. Unbelievable !  We followed all the instructions they gave us, yet it resulted negatively. I asked him to take my name down or give me a pager even if it takes three hours to eat. I told him that we are locals and it is very disturbing the way we were treated. This should not happen. I will not be recommending this to my local and mainland friends and family. This was a very bad experience in which we DO NOT want to go through ever again. WE JUST WANTED TO EAT DINNER ON  A SUNDAY NIGHT, GRANTED IT WAS A HALLOWEEN NIGHT.  Can you believe the absurdity of it all?  Pathetic.  I want to talk to CORPORATE TOMORROW.

diego m.,"Honolulu, HI",60,68,,5.0,6/26/2008,"I believe their burger is the best in the island in my personal opinion and yes, I have tasted Kua'aina Burgers but this is the real deal. It was grilled and there is a smokey flavor to it almost reminescent of a home made broiled burger. Their service is as good as the food -- so is the location except it might be a little hot outside in the open. They even give you french bread and their portions are big --- to satisfy the big eaters - this is the best burger in the island period and I have been San Diego and nothing compared to this place Big portions - Good Quality of food - Great service and yes, if you cannot eat the food, the waiter will be more than happy to prep it up for you to bring home - fast - reliable and good service.

Cheesecake factory became the chain restaurant industry standard.  They realized they can succeed through consistency and by serving ridiculously large portions of food that's not bad.  For them, doubling the portion size doesn't double the business costs but allows them to double their price, which people will easily pay since they feel they are getting their money's worth.

Mike N.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,,1.0,6/18/2014,Menu is big but I had a lot of problems with the service.  Yesterday we went to the Cheesecake Factory for an early lunch.  The waiter we got was more concerned with the tables that had 4 or more people.  He rarely came over to see if we needed anything and it took us a long time to even order.  Once we ordered it took 30 minutes to get our food and this was at 11:00 am before the lunch rush.  All the other tables got their food but not us.  When we got our food my wife's breakfast had potatoes that were dried out and hard. The parsley was wilted and dried out on the plate.  When I started eating my mashed potatoes that came with the meatloaf I noticed something hard in it.  When I spit it out I found a piece of hard plastic in it.  I called for the manager and Marshall didn't want to talk about how long it took for us to get our meals but he talked loudly so everyone around us could hear that he would handle the mater of the plastic in the food.  When we decided that we just wanted to leave we looked around for the waiter and he was no where to be found.  I did see him laughing away in the kitchen area but he would not return to the tables.  I finally decided to get our check from the manager and then there was a wait again for the waiter to get our payment so we could leave.  This restaurant has really gone downhill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1400
Ange M.,"Lahaina, HI",59,95,,4.0,4/5/2009,"So we went here with a group of 13 Adults and 5 Toddlers.  Totally unintentional on my part.  Wanted to dine here with the BF's Mom (who lives on Oahu) and thought we were only meeting her.  So, I knew there would be a wait, but did not figure it would be that long. They showed up with the WHOLE family.  Had I known that would happen, I would not have suggested this place as I really don't think it's smart to go here with large groups like that due to the wait time and the fact that you can't even sit together anyway. But they did a great job with us.  The sat us all in the same area even if it was on 3 separate tables and we had to wait 45 minutes as they had promised when we checked in.  Not bad considering.... The hostess and servers were fabulous.  I work in the Food and Beverage Industry so I can appreciate when they handle chaos with grace.  And our group was utter chaos with 5 toddlers. They brought complimentary plates of bread and sliced banana's for the kids, which was nice.  And it was great for the kids b/c they could make all the noise they wanted and nobody noticed since the place was so loud. It took a little while for our drinks to come, but once they did, all the rest of the orders came quickly and without much delay. Granted they may have made a plan to get us out of there as quickly as possible since we were a nightmare group in my opinion, but they handled everything with pure grace.  The Waiter was fabulous and remembered (or made note of) exactly who had what although we did not order all at the same time and was ordering appetizers with entrees and drinks then adding more on later as parts of our group left and came back from bathroom breaks, etc.  Like I said...utter chaos. Now for the food....YUMMY!!  This is not your average Franchise chain.  This is food you can find in most upscale restaurants but done quick and done well.  I had the Fried Macaroni and Cheese as an appetizer with my daughter.  It was delish....ask for extra marinara sauce.  It really adds something to the dish. Then I had the Chinese chicken salad which was HUGE and wonderful.  The BF had the Steak Diane with Mashed Potatoes.  He's a Chef and thought the dish was perfect.  I tried it and was pleasantly surprised as well.  Really good. The rest of the family had all sorts of stuff, but I didn't taste it so cannot review, but everyone said the food was fabulous.  Even the Ahi Poke, which I thought would not be good looked yummy. We had the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  What can I say about that? Broke da Mouth goodness.....OMG!!! It was worth every calorie and so very very sinful.

Haiya S.,"Hawaii, HI",1,7,,5.0,7/8/2010,"Ok, so I know i say everything is my favorite. BUT, there are degrees and this little Cheesecake Factory is officially my FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD. I can go to the most expensive places, but in the end, this is what i love the most. the food is just so good. No matter what I order I want to just eat the plate too. And since the plates are huge, I always end up with a bit of a stomach ache because I'm too small to eat that much. But even with that stomach ache, I'm so happy cuz it's so DELICIOUSSSSIEJOIEWJOJ!!! :D) Their 4 cheese pasta is perfection. And all the sandwiches I've tried have just been so lovely. And their mango smoothie is so nice too. When I tried to take my family there they were like ""we dont wanna go to no factory. We want Chili's!"" Where I come from, it's practically a village- so it's always big deal where to eat when we have a family vacation to a civilization!  But since they had no idea what they were talkin' about, I was like, ""NOO!! WE HAVE TO!!"". And so all grumblin', they went in and oh boyy did they get hit with happiness! I forgot what my sisters got, but they were just happy as heck. The great thing about this place is that they have so many options that everyone will surely be fattened up and happy. And their cheesecakes are the best in the world. Nothing compares to a Cheesecake factory cheescake. If you're trying to lose weight though, don't go here because the calories (as I've discovered) are what make the food taste so good.

Bruno Mars (Beautiful Girls).  For two old guys with smiles to the extreme, they knew how to rock the crowd.  You could tell by the single Japanese tourist standing in the front, clapping, and getting his kabuki on.  There was a gentleman at the bar who was REALLY enjoying himself.  As the music ended, so did his night.  He managed to fall backwards and practically break his ass and nearly took me with him.  In a daze, he stood up and calmly walked out....like a boss!   Tonight I realized that Cheesecake Factory is more than just a meeting grounds for having a couple of cocktails at the beginning of the night.  With food this good, entertaining drunkards, and prompt service, it's a definite visit.  My only complaint would be how BUSY this place can feel.  With so many people wandering about, it gets loud and can feel like you're eating in a food court with a buddy rather than being on a candle lit man-date.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1280

B careful about that and don't park in the sheraton hotel lot!!!  Anyways as for food my wife ordered the chicken medeira which was fantastic! The chicken breast was cooked perfectly with mushrooms, white cheese, and some semi sweet wine sauce almost similar to flavor to spaghetti factory's chicken marsala. The side of red skinned garlic mashed potatoes and crispy crunchy green fresh asparagus was stellar. This dish deserved a 5 star. I ordered the fish and chips. The fish are 5 half palm sized cods which is essentially butter fish. The beer batter was good and the french fries were crispy with enough salt and the side of cole slaw was very nice. However the cod was overcooked and chewy - not how cod is supposed to be; this completely ruined it for me. Also i was expecting to taste some butterfish flavor in it which i wasn't able to until the very last chewy bite. This dish gets a 1 star from me. Hence this place gets 3 stars for our food that night. The wheat bread and sourdough they gave us before our meal was delicious especially after a 1.25 hr wait. Service was good.

Glenda S.,"Waianae, HI",1,4,,5.0,7/22/2012,"My friends and I ate at the Cheesecake Factory last night and we had a great time dining there. Due to it's popularity in the center of Waikiki Beach, we decided to go early because we knew the wait will be long since they don't take reservations. And it so happened to be an hour wait.  When we finally got seated we were introduced to probably the best server in the entire restaurant. Her name is Chonte and she was fabulous! Servers can sometimes make or break the dining experience and Chonte made it wonderful for us.  She knew everything about the menu and gave excellent recommendations. She was always came by to check up on us and refilled our waters at the right time.  As for the food, I ordered the miso salmon (thanks to Chonte) and I loved it!. It was served over a bed of rice (I got brown rice) and with a miso and butter sauce, if I'm not mistaken? Generous portion size but I tried my hardest to finish it all because it was so delicious. I don't know the names of the dishes my friends ordered but I sampled the fried macaroni and cheese and that was yummy. Overall we were all pleased with the food we ordered. Now going on with the cheesecake, I loved the banana cream pie cheesecake and pineapple upside down cheesecake. But to be honest I only had two bites because I was soo full from dinner.  I love coming here, especially with friends. We are all on from the westside so trust that we traveled far to get some of their scrumptious food.

Keoki H.,"Kaneohe, HI",3,75,8,2.0,2/1/2009,"First off to the tourist, You deserve to be separated from your money!!!  Why did you spend so much money to fly here and eat at the Cheese cake factory?????? Get with your hotel Concierge and find some local food. Besides Hawaiian, with all our ethnic groups here you can find some fantastic Japanese, Filipino, Chinese hole in the walls to restaurants that the flavors of the food, the ambiance, even looking around at the customers makes you feel like you are somewhere else besides Kansas. Please drift away from Waikiki and move out to other areas of Oahu.  The score seems to be  28 votes 4 and 5 stars totaled;  16 votes 3 stars;  11 votes 2 and 1 stars;  Looks like my 2 star vote will now tie the 4 and 5 stars with the average and below average grade.  I really don't get the high 4 and 5 star votes unless they were voting for the Cheesecake.  I will admit the cheese cake is good, really good. They are called the cheese cake factory so their specialty should be the cheese cake not the main meal. Kinda like going to a steak house the steak should be really good. (reason I fail Buzz's steak house, their steak sucks but fish is really good, yet they call themselves a steak house).  Anyways, back to on track with CF. I try to stay away from anything Waikiki but sometimes you got to go for visitors or someones bright (dim) idea.  Here is the low down on Cheesecake Factory (CF).  Cheesecake really good, expensive but Waikiki is a expensive place so  no mater where you go on Waikiki you have to expect to pay more.  Everything else like steaks, salads, ect... really are poor. I suggest go for the cheese cake but not the main meal you will be disappointed by their main meals.  I have had their Cesar salad both times, not good at all. a 1 star.  My wife has had a couple of their appetizers put together to make her meal and share with me. I just grade them as okay, a 2 star okay.  There are long lines to get in, very long lines.  Parking and the traffic to drive there is difficult. The parking garage is generally full and parking spots all seem to be compact car, extra small.  I would say not good for kids only because of the long wait to get in and the crowded seating once you get in.  Not good for groups, no design for big tables, long waits to sit 4.  I would go at lunch shorter lines to get in. Night time is incredibly long. It's nothing to wait 45+min. at night.  I do not consider them affordable in their price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1280

n c.,"Honolulu, HI",0,26,,5.0,10/16/2009,"I just returned from lunch here, but I am going to base this review on the MANY times I have eaten here instead ('cause that tall dude waiter didn't live up to the quality of service I'm used to at this place). PROS: Appetizers: Avocado spring rolls, Tex-Mex egg rolls, Kalua Pork Nachos (wife's choice) Entrees:  Shrimp Bistro Pasta, Chicken Farfale, Fish Tacos, Kobe Burger, Chicken Piccata Desserts:  What can I say?  All good.  Red Velvet Cheesecake is unreal.  Whilte Choc Rasperry Truffle, Caramel Apple Strudel.....awesome (the staff here are always willing to share their favorites, which I like). Not a cheesecake fan?  No prob.  The Godiva Brownie Sundae can feed an army and is awesome.  Or try the Warm Apple Crisp smothered in vanilla ice cream. CONS: Parking: it's a walk to a distant garage, but after eating here that's probably not a bad thing! (I miss the valet parking they used to have) Crowds:  If you don't like to wait (like me), go at off-peak times: before they open at 11am for lunch or no later than 5pm for dinner. Food is almost always great and served to everyone @ same time (except today).  If you have small kids, they usually bring bread w/sliced bananas at no charge. For the critics who say it's not local:  what about the music,  staff atttire, & setting (torches, ceiling fans)?  Also, do they offer the same fish selections and Kalua Pork dishes @ the other ones?  I've been to Vegas & Anaheim and noticed a lot of differences.  Just a thought.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1300

Teresa S.,"Honolulu, HI",1,19,1,3.0,1/9/2012,"I agree that this Cheesecake Factory holds up it's reputation as good, reliable and fun. They do have tasty and pricey cheesecake. With the wait time up to more than an hour at peak times such as dinner and lunch.... I prefer others, I like to live a little and try something new. If you haven't been to a Cheesecake factory the one in Redondo Beach, Calif is the one to try. Right on the ocean, outside seating or the regular noisey indoor seating as the this one. The Honolulu location is like any other indoor restaurant. If you sit outdoors on the patio have people staring at you as they walk down the busiest sidewalk  on any of the Hawaiian islands.  No view unless you like to look at badly dressed tourists...Chucks and Shorebird both have views and in the same area in Honolulu.  You're on a Island don't spend your time waiting for a table that won't remind you you're in the tropics but will make you think you're back in the city.

I was super excited about finding a Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki after being repeatedly disappointed by the food there.  We were seated with our two month old daughter in a HUGE booth-- SCORE! She lied down on the seat in between us as we ate which is soooooo wonderful because we actually got to eat instead of trying to quiet her down the whole meal. Our server was really super nice and very accommodating.  I got the Chicken Costoletta, my husband got the Miso Salmon lunch special, and we shared an Endive Blue Cheese salad.

Luck would have it though, the bar had 2 open seats, so we sat and got served immediately! The high top tables are first come first serve, so if you can stake one out, grab it and you won't have to wait 1.5 hours for a table! There is also another smaller bar in the way back, but has less seats than the front bar (the far bar is a lot quieter if you are looking for that). The Big Island Iced Tea was a little too sweet (more juice than alcohol) and they only have 4 beers on tap (Kirin, Longboard, Bud Light, Fir Rock). Our bartender was great! He got us set up to eat (he laid out a white linen napkin to simulate a tablecloth!)...We started with the Thai Lettuce Wraps...AWESOME! It came on a huge plate with carrots, sprouts, cucumbers, chicken, noodles, 3 sauces, and bib lettuce. You assemble your own wrap with whatever you want in it and top it with sauce (a peanut, a basil, and a soy)! It came out really fast because once we ordered it, the bartender immediately put it into the computer for the kitchen! We then ordered the Tex Mex eggrolls filled with beans, corn, chicken...not spicy, but flavorful! Came with salsa and guac! Also very good and also came out really fast! Service at the bar was excellent...they are back there working really hard and quickly to make drinks and serve their bar customers!

Fish & chips are awesome, the giant burrito is Ok, salads have been tasty, and the fries, too. Anyway, the basics are done well enough, and if you can remember to split the giant portions, the bill won't give you a heart attack (uh....but the food might). Haven't ordered any cheesecake yet, but only because I am avoiding the feeling of fat-cow-dom. Anyway, Cheesecake is also great for running like a machine: they see you, sit you, take your order, get it to you, and check on you every now and then to see how you are doing, and everything is so fast and efficient, yet not rushed.

Even though I am pleased that the cheesecakes come in a variety of flavors, I rather Junior's Cheesecake as far as texture is concerned. I had the Mahi Mahi dinner and it wasn't good, my fish wasn't cooked in some parts and taste bland on it's own. However the mash and tomatoes vinaigrette that came with that meal was genius, the taste profiles definitely went well together and made my tongue do a happy dance in my mouth.

FOR OUR FOOD!!!  Yes that's right, an hour and a half from the time we ordered the food to the time the food was brought to our table.  The waitress gave no explanation nor apology for the wait time as well!  Needless to say, we probably won't be returning to this restaurant...at least not to dine in.  Because I must add though that the red velvet cheesecake is really good! ...so I'll do with some dessert take out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1360

Every time we have been here we have had exceptional customer service and the food has been great.  We usually bring guests here just because the experience has been so great.  Now there is one thing with this place and that is it get CROWDED.  I am talking the longest lines i have ever seen for a restaurant.  I mean I know it is in the heart of Waikiki but dang.  I just find it amazing for a chain restaurant to be so consistent with food.   All I can say is if you are in Waikiki take some time and eat here, it is worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1360

Patricia F.,"San Francisco, CA",6,50,6,4.0,8/20/2008,"I initially resisted the lure of the Cheesecake Factory, but here's what made it a surprisingly 4-star experience: - Actual Hawaiian options, in addition to the usual 14+ pages of middle-America comfort food.  They offered several local, fresh fish options. And the rare wasabi-crusted Ahi tuna was pretty good.   - Really strong drinks.  CF's ""tropical martini"" may not have the fresh fruit juice of a posh House Without a Key cocktail, but it has at least 3x the alcohol. - Best restaurant for people-watching.  It can be tough to get a table on the patio, but if you go really early (helps to be jetlagged) AND specifically ask/wait for it, it's fun to sit outside and watch the foot traffic. There aren't  that many outdoor seating options in Waikiki.

Got to the bar and the bartender motioned to us that there was an open bar table, first come first serve. So we ended up eating there and did not need to wait for the whole hour for a regular table. The food was delicious. The only down side to this place is that the portion sizes are HUGE! We ate the corn cake tamales, and firecracker salmon (a must try). For dinner, she had the meatloaf and I the carbonara pasta, ended our meal with two desserts. Of course we ended up doggy bagging our dinner and desserts because of the size of these dishes.

I was not exactly happy to find it there and would have preferred a more upscale dining spot in its place. Each time I walked by, I'd shrug at the thought of the long lines... people dying to get in. There ARE better places to dine at people! But alas, fate brought me here during my 1 week here in which I thought I would never enter this spot ;p Friend decided to do a late 945pm dinner by one of the seaside spots that didn't serve dessert other than the typical ice cream. I wasn't feeling hungry but I had chocolate cake on my mind ;p 1055pm, we went across the street to Haagen Daaz hoping to get some cake, no such luck. Then friend somehow recalled that the Cheesecake Factory (back on other side of street) serves till 11pm and we could get our cake if we hurried. Ran across the street, got into Cheesecake in the nick of time, changed our minds, decided to do take-out so we can enjoy the slice in our lovely room @ the Moana Surfrider. Took a while to decide what to get... ended up with the Choc fudge (never fails!). Ooops forgot to tell them no whipped cream! They were faster than the speed of light... the cake was packed and in the blink of an eye 3 flower squirts of cream was already accompanying our slice in the box. Oh well.

After a big heavy meal this one dessert was big enough to share between the four of us. Soooo delicious. Definitely the highlight of the meal.

Located right in Waikiki at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, this place isn't hard to find. Parking is in the Royal Hawaiian parking structure and the restaurant validates for you. The first 2 hours with validation is free.  We went around 3:30 so we were able to get  seated right away. I think anytime before 5pm is a good time to go. Anytime after that, the wait jumps to over an hour long. We ordered the crab & artichoke dip as our appetizer. It was so good that it disappeared way too fast. They give a pretty good portion size of the dip as well. For our entrees we ordered the farfalle chicken pasta, chipotle chicken sandwich, a burger, and a soup & salad lunch combo. Everything tasted great!  The minus 1 star is for the priceyness of this place. It's a little on the pricier side. Nonetheless, I enjoy the food here.

I decided on the Green Chicaquilles with pork.  They were good and the sauce flavorful. The plate was huge and was more than i could finish after having bread and butter while we waited for our orders. Everyone enjoyed their meal, however, there is some strange system of how they service a table by using multiple waiters.  We did have a large table, but we were never sure who was going to do what at the table. There were several order mistakes and some new person would show up and find that there was a problem, just to be followed by another person bring out the same mistaken dish again. Once our meal was finished, one got their checks right away, others had to wait 30 plus minutes before they could get someone to bring their check.

He just took our order, refilled our drinks once, checked on us once maybe and handed us our check. I've seen other waitresses offering better service to the other tables.  Oh well, at least I got to eat my fave, the crispy won ton crab. We also ordered the everything pizza with salad and surprising the pizza was great! No room for cheesecake, but took one home.

There is no wait to be seated., but we did get seated all the way in the back and the tables are stacked so close together that it makes it feel Pretty darn uncomfortable like you are joining the table next to you!  Once again, our server as the greatest, but do-able.  And I'm not sure why, why in the world they took off my crispy crab won ton off the menu!!!!

The Factory Burger had a nice char to it on the outside while also being moist and juicy on the inside, the Sourdough French really went will with burger holding up to the juices from it. SERVICE: Great service!! Even though the waiter originally thought lunch ended at 4:30pm when I pointed out the menu said 5:00pm he still was able to put it in with 5minutes to spare.

Whenever my family has a special occasion The Cheescake Factory in Waikiki is one of our top go to places because the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you receive, plus it has to be a special occasion for me to agree on a 1hr plus wait time to eat anywhere!

Pleasant surprise. After we were sat, our waitress was very prompt with out drinks. She gave us bread as well and then took our order. I ordered pasta without meat, when all of our food came out, as my husband had his flash on for Snapchat to record the well presented food that just arrived at our table waiting for fresh stinky cheese to me grated on top of it. As the flash of light went over my food I noticed little pieces of meat in my pasta. I told the man who dropped the food off that was grading the cheese and he said, Where??,"" as if I was lying or was mistaken. I know to check my food now because there has been countless times when there is meat in my food when I had already requested from the wait staff for there not to be meat in my food.  Anyhow, he took the food back, our waitress walked by and probably noticed that I did not have my food and failed to ask why. Then when they brought me a new meatless pasta, she came to our table asking why it took so long... Hm... She said very offensively that she is ""VEGAN! And it is not her fault!"" I was not blaming her. I simply stated that it had meat in my pasta.  As a result they took my food off the bill, thank you, and the food was good. No big deal. I wasn't expecting my food to be taken off. I was a little sad we didn't get a second serving of bread, but we probably didn't need it anyways.  I'd give this place 3ish stars closer to 4 so I just rounded up. Will probably be back, but won't order that pasta again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu

She then told my friend that they were out of the crab artichoke dip so just get the artichoke dip as it's still a dip, and just be glad you have something!

Your stomach will eat itself before you even get your meal. I guess if you eat at some abnormal time then you'd be lucky with no wait.  I tend to do take out more often now. They have a garage with validated parking, but the garage is so far! It's like a hike to get there and back! If you have a buddy it'll be better cause you can park on the side. I usually call it in as I'm doing my hike. Sometimes there's a wait at the cashier to pay anyway for a take out order.  Want anything extra? Like brown bread? Just ask! They'll gladly pack it up for you!! Today I was on hold for a bit but the cashier was friendly once I was able to place an order in, despite how busy they are!  You can also order a jar of dressing to go! But beware!! They're made fresh on the daily so they go bad within two days.. I mean really bad! And sour!

It was really good. You couldn't even taste the alcohol with the ice cream in it. The drink itself was pretty thick so it took a while to finish.  I ordered the miso salmon and it was perfect. The presentation was gorgeous! The salmon was perfectly cooked. It had a nice sweet and savory flavor and a nice flakiness to it. It was surrounded by this white sauce and some peas. The sauce was light and had a nice flavor. I couldn't tell what it was but it was good. I wish I had more peas though.  Of course, when you come here, you need to get dessert! I got the tiramisu cheesecake. It was awesome! Tasted like tiramisu and had the richness of a cheese.  The only hiccup was that they brought out the wrong pasta for my friend.

Warren N.,"Honolulu, HI",108,102,109,4.0,8/2/2017,"We came here on a Wednesday to celebrate a birthday.  Food: After drooling all day over their exhaustive menu, we decided to order the avocado egg rolls (always a winner!) and I ordered the chicken and biscuits. Touted as comfort food, with the ""best"" buttermilk biscuits on the side, this dish was what I was craving. The portions of chicken, vegetables and mashed potatoes were generous, and the pan gravy was savory but not over-salted. Hints of sage and white pepper flavored the gravy nicely. But the buttermilk biscuits...? Maybe I haven't visited a lot of places in the South to know how true buttermilk biscuits should look and taste. However, I've made and had enough biscuits (just look at me) to know what I like in a good one: a crispy exterior, some layered flakiness, and some ""elevation""or height to show the baking powder and soda are doing their thing. Unfortunately, these were not the ""best."" While the exterior of these was crisp, their lack of height and rather doughy insides told me that they had wilted like a bouffant hairdo in today's high heat and humidity.  Dessert was a shock for me. Never before had I considered ordering the low carb cheesecake, but since I was full from the appetizer and entree I decided to try it. Mind you, it weighs in at around half the calories of the other cheesecakes so I was feeling quite sanctimonious... It was nice and light, almost mousse-like, with a thin walnut graham crust sweetened with Splenda. Nice! Service: Our server Brandi was awesome. She embodied friendly attentiveness. She was even sensitive to our birthday girl and asked if she wanted them to sing or not.

We were seated immediately as it was past the lunch rush. Then comes our server being kind and racist at the same time. She slowly asked me if I wanted bread and water. At first I thought it was just her way of speaking, but it definitely wasn't. I ordered the pasta and my bf ordered the hawaiian pizza with a caesar salad. Again, at this point our server asked if I needed chopsticks. I'm eating pasta... so no.  Strangely enough, after our meal, while she waves goodbye to my boyfriend, she BOWS to me. What is that? I understand that there are a lot of Asian tourists (and even locals) running around Oahu, but that is just too much. While the food was great, the service was just inappropriate on all levels.  To the managers of this location- please teach your employees to behave appropriately to customers. I don't care how nice they may be, my server flat out made me feel super uncomfortable. It's 2017- please stop thinking in reverse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=20
Nellie F.,"Honolulu, HI",344,116,483,4.0,6/3/2017,"Cheesecake factory to me is a classic. Their food quality is as great here as it is in every other franchise of theirs I've visited in different states. The lunch menu has a lot of items from the dinner menu, however they are a bit cheaper and smaller portions. Which may not be a bad thing because their dinner portions are HUGE! My mom and I shared the Louisiana Chicken pasta and had avocado egg rolls for starter. And of course we indulged in the complimentary and well-loved fresh Brown and Sourdough bread.  The food was all fresh and hot. The pasta comes al dente (a bit chewy) unless you tell them otherwise. I prefer mine fully cooked but forgot to mention this time. The pasta dish was also nice and spicy with the chicken well seasoned and cooked. The servers also ask if you would like fresh Parmesan cheese on your food (love it)! The avocado egg rolls were so good! Fried but not greasy at all, and nice and hot. The dipping sauce for them is very unique - kind of sweet/herbal but a great compliment to the taste of the rolls. We didn't leave room for dessert that day, but I know from several previous visits that their desserts are magnificent! They don't have their own parking garage nor valet, but they do validate for the Royal Hawaiian parking garage. The restaurant also gets RIDICULOUSLY busy right around 5pm with wait times sometimes upwards of an hour and a half, so come early if you can. Bar seating is open, so that's a good bet if it's only a couple people and someone is standing vigil.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=20
Karli H.,"Honolulu, HI",260,34,97,3.0,9/4/2017,"It's Labor Day madness here in Waikiki. Decided to come here for a lunch with 6 of our friends and since we got here when they opened we didn't have to wait a long time which was awesome. The hostess was nice and lead us to our table and let us know who our server was, gave us our menus and left. We were at our table for about 10 minutes before our server even greeted us and I get it, it's busy now so she took a little bit to get to us. Ordered drinks and the corn tamale appetizer which was delicious, however the drinks took about 25 minutes to get. I don't know what it is about Waikiki and everyone taking forever to make some drinks but I think this is why I never like to come here.   Food came out and we were missing multiple items but the kitchen didn't read it correctly or there was a miscommunication because we had about 6 extra sides of eggs (we like egg on pasta, we're weird) none the less we were missing items and our 2nd round of drinks took awhile as well for a glass of wine.  Lastly we ordered shots to end our lunch because why not it's a holiday but the server didn't ask if we wanted it chilled, salt, lime or anything. As soon as she heard the word shots she left and put it in.  Good meal but I hate Waikiki and there shitty service.

Kit W.,"Honolulu, HI",238,266,566,4.0,3/12/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants. Delicious food, generous portions, and cheesecake for days--what's not to love, right? As if that weren't enough, it gets better! They usually do a deal around Thanksgiving/Christmas time where for every $25 in electronic gift cards you purchase from their website, you receive two complimentary slices of cheesecake--to gift or to keep! Seeing how a slice of cheesecake costs between $7.50 and $8.95, this is a super sweet deal! I came here for lunch twice within the past month so I could redeem my complimentary slices (they expire by March 31). I ordered the regular portion of Pasta Da Vinci both times because it's just that good! It's simple--sautéed chicken, mushrooms, and onions in a delicious Madeira wine sauce tossed with penne pasta and Parmesan--but so undeniably unforgettable. I will totally order this again and again even though there are SO many tempting menu items! I don't think you can go wrong with any of their cheesecakes. I recently tried their fresh strawberry, mango key lime, and lemoncello cream torte, and all of them were divine.

Next, Blayne our excellent waiter took our orders.  He was so friendly and had excellent customer service.  He constantly checked up on us.  He explained the menu.  He was always filling up our waters.  Actually, he was the best server that I've encountered in a while, considering, our large group and our orders as well as our group asking for separate checks. As for my entree, I liked it.  The ahi taco was cute.  The flavor was interesting for a taco.  It was more on the sweet side.  I would have preferred it to have been more flavorful and spicier.

My family usually orders the cuts of steak and always recommend it. They have a wide selection of items to choose from so you have many choices. Service is always good, even when ordering takeout. Prices are what you would expect from a Waikiki restaurant. Fun fact, you can order their delicious bread for take out for just $3 and they give you a big loaf!

Today I ordered the Super Antioxidant Salad- ""A Delicious Blend of Salad Greens, Spinach, Kale, Avocado, Broccoli, Grapes, Roasted Pear, Blueberries, Onion, Sunflower Seeds and Almonds with Lemon-Blueberry Vinaigrette.""  It was amazing.  The Lemon Blueberry Vinaigrette being light, but flavorful.  It was a great combination of salty and sweet which you got in every bite. Now, besides my mouth watering salad, I need to do a shout out to our man and best Waiter ever Mathew S.  He was quick, attentive, and even went beyond the call to ensure our needs were meant.  He not only got us fed, he somehow bonded with us as he wrapped with our sons about surfing and enjoying the simple things in life.  That boy needs a raise!  But till he gets that we have him a bit extra on top of the usual 20% because he deserved it. I'm again a full and happy girl.  Yay me. ------------------------------------------- The best customer service I have ever had here!  Havi gave us exactly what we wanted and more.  Since I'm always too full for dessert I did cheesecake first.  Went with the classic strawberry cheesecake.  Perfect as always.   For dinner we had Shrimp Scampi with extra garlic and cream.  Also with extra sauce on the side.  OUR FAVORITE!  A must for garlic and cream pasta lovers.  The shrimp was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Large shrimp- about 6.   I also did a falafel salad.  It was HUGE.  Very light and chopped well- very uniformly chopped.  The falafel a we're not tradition.  The chickpeas were finely ground and rolled into balls.  Not what I'm used to, but taste great.  Would do again.  BUT, so huge that if it isn't your main course you should share.

The wait was supposed to be 45 mins long but we had a pleasant surprise when they called us after fifteen minutes!  The service is always very good at this cheesecake factory.  The food was delish! Friend got the macaroni and cheese burger which was very filling but very good! Then I ordered their gumbo. The gumbo was ok, I've had better. I think it lacked spices. The presentation was very pretty but like I said I've had better. Their menu is so massive!!! I would personally cut it down to half and just pick their best sellers because some items on their menu are not worth ordering. When it comes to alcohol I think they do it right! I've never had a bad drink here! We ordered a margarita which was nice and strong.  Last but not least their cheese cake!!!!! It doesn't matter which on one you order, they are all so so so good!

On my most recent visit I was with seven other individuals and we sat in the back end of the restaurant closer to the Royal Hawaiian.  Complimentary bread and water was delivered to the tables.  Menus were already placed on the tables. I had to study the menu since I was undecided of what to order.  Should I order pasta, burger, sandwich, steak, or seafood dishes.  I opted to order the Shrimp Scampi with Steak Diane.  The dish comes with mashed potatoes.  I didn't know that I ordered the same dish as one of my dinner companions. My dinner was delicious.  My dinner companions noticed since I cleaned the entire plate minus the gravy.  Did I have room for dessert...nope.  I was stuffed from my meal and the complimentary bread.  Plus I drank two full cups of water.

The staff also cleared tables that left next to us within literally 30 seconds of the people leaving. They also brought new parties to those tables quickly. Super efficient. The food sizes and quality were pretty good, and the prices are similar to those in Waikiki. I think they do validate parking, but we just park at the zoo parking lot and walk around. We got the spinach artichoke dip, a burger, the chicken tacos, and two lemonades.

I love their Chinese Chicken Salad. I always, always get the Miso Salmon on mashed potatoes. It's the best Miso Salmon I've ever had in my life. The miso is slightly sweetened and contains mirin. Even though it's the lunch portion, I still can't finish it. I take the leftovers for my dinner.  My favorite cheesecake is White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut.

Fran C.,"Honolulu, HI",460,954,11214,4.0,11/25/2016,"It's been years since I've been to The Cheesecake Factory! And I wanna say I probably haven't been back here for over 10 years or so........ I remembered a time when The Cheesecake Factory had first opened in Waikiki back in 2003, and I went with my ohana to dine here several times.  All I remembered about The Cheesecake Factory was that they served pretty simple food, they gave huge portions, & the cheesecake was legit! It's now 2016, so I decided to come back here for lunch with a friend, as I figured if I go here during the weekday, it wouldn't be too crowded. Sure enough this place is still popular as when we arrived just before the opening time of 11:00 AM, there was a long line of customers waiting by the entrance door.  Lucky for us, since the restaurant is huge, we did not have to wait at all, and was seated right away. Shortly after, our server stopped by to drop off menus, & take our drink order.  After checking out the menu, I decided to get the - Super Antioxidant Salad which was a delicious blend of salad greens, spinach, kale, avocado, broccoli, grapes, roasted pear, blueberries, onion, sunflower seeds & almonds, with a lemon-blueberry vinaigrette dressing. I also added some grilled chicken to my salad to boost my protein intake.  With my salad, I ordered an ice tea to wash all of this down. My friend ended up ordering the - The Classic Burger, which was a gigantic chop house hamburger. Served with a slice of grilled onion, lettuce, tomato and you can either get french fries, or green salad. Which my friend ended up with the green salad. Of course when you go to The Cheesecake Factory, you have to order some of their delicious cheesecakes! They have such a large selection of cheesecakes, I have to admit, it's pretty hard to decide on which cheesecake to order.  At the end, I ordered the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake - which was a Banana Cream Cheesecake topped with bavarian cream, and it came with fresh sliced banana.  My friend got the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake - which was layers of creamy vanilla bean cheesecake, vanilla mousse & it was topped with whipped cream. What can I say about the grub? I really loved my Super Antioxidant Salad! It was the perfect meal which didn't leave me bloated, or too full..........having that salad saved me some space in my tummy for dessert! (See, you gotta plan your eating!).  The salad was not only pleasant to look at, but also the mixture of greens with the dressing was the perfect match! The grilled chicken was kinda bland, but I just ordered it to boost my protein intake, so I was okay with it! My friend enjoy the burger.........and the side salad was good too! As for the cheesecake desserts.............there is nothing bad tasting on their cheesecake menu. Whatever you order here, you cannot go wrong!  Overall, the prices for the food here at The Cheesecake Factory is kinda pricey for lunch, as I paid $58.00 for lunch (with tip), but the service here was great!

The attention to detail is incredible.  I left a compliment for whoever is in charge of the kitchen as this person consistently serves the best quality and presentation of any CCF.  The Chef must take pride in the food. I am a loyal patron to this location. You may have to wait an hour so check In early and go across to the International Market Place or sit at the bar. The food is worth the wait.  Price is average for Hawaii. Service is average for Hawaii. I live here and frequent many Waikiki restaurants weekly.  Thank you Waikiki CCF!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=40
Nick W.,"San Jose, CA",304,148,40,1.0,4/30/2017,"I have a gluten, soy, and dairy allergy. 3 people came out to confirm my order that I had to change 2 times.. understandable. But when I get my food and eat my rice. Half way thru there is a layer of soy sauce that I realized I was eating when unnoticed a different taste. The waiter acknowledged it and asked if I  wanted a new serving. I said no thank you. The damage was done and I'll be in pain probably by the time I get home. Nothing was done about the bill or any other follow up. Sad. I usually pick this chain when I'm traveling as a safe bet. Guess not. Update from 4 hours later: the pain is finally going down and def was exposed to gluten and soy from that sauce.

Ok, I'm going to let you in on a little secret(ok it's not that secret, but it has worked for me). The best time to go to Cheesecake Factory is on Sunday morning for their Sunday Brunch!  I love the sunday specials and you still get to order the regular menu items! (say what!) The best part is there is no long lines. We are usually seated right when we get there or after 15 minutes. That's fantab! Don't you think!   That's all I got, I have a feeling I'm going to regret telling my secret. BUT I feel obliged to let people know and enjoy their food as much as I do.

Evan K.,"Honolulu, HI",165,11,20,5.0,7/3/2017,"Even though Cheesecake Factory is a ""chain"" restaurant, the experience doesn't feel like that at all.  The menu is a novel, but that basically means there's something for everyone.  My personal favorites are the following (all 9/10 or 10/10 dishes in my opinion): Fried Calamari: The breading is light and flaky, comes with a garlic aioli sauce and marinara sauce.  Sometimes it can be a bit too salty, but 9 times out of 10 it's a good dish. Caesar Salad: The ""appetizer"" size feeds about 3-4 people; when my parents and I get the calamari and Caesar salads, we're full by the time our entrees come. Factory Nachos: The tortilla chips are really tasty and unique, the cheese sauce has hints of American cheese if that's your thing, but there are also Mexican cheeses as well.  Comes with guac, sour cream, and a lot of other fixings.   Fish Tacos (tempura style): Four fish tacos that comes with Spanish rice and beans. Cuban Sandwich: Ham, Swiss cheese, kalua pig, mustard, and pickles. California Cheese-Steak Sandwich: Basically steak, cheese, and peppers; simplicity is sometimes a good thing. Pasta Da Vinci: I get this with linguine (originally comes with penne, which I don't think absorbs the sauce as well); comes with chicken and mushrooms in a wine sauce. Now...for the CHEESECAKES: S'Mores Cheesecake and Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  I love the graham cracker crust on the S'Mores Cheesecake.  Get both and have your stomach thank me later. Go early for lunch (~11AM/12PM) if you want to beat the lines , or early dinner time (~5PM/6PM) as this place gets packed.  Otherwise, call ahead for takeout is your best bet. One last note on customer service: I feel like Cheesecake Factory definitely puts an emphasis on this when they train their employees (sometimes you can just tell).  Over the several years I've been going to this location, I have never had a bad customer service experience - I also want to give a thank you to one cashier (I believe her name was Nicole), who comped us a cheesecake after my girlfriend and I noticed we were missing salad dressing in our takeout order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=60

My chicken Parmesan plate came with 3 huge chicken breasts, with a side order of mashed and green beans. It was so good and I wanted to finish it at that moment. But with just one chicken breast, i was already full.  I do have to say, my boyfriend and I didn't enjoy the hazelnut crunch cheesecake.

They definitely need to start taking reservations or come up with a better system for seating customers! Once we finally got seated, they tried to seat us outside in front of the restaurant. No offense but I don't want to be seated right next to people who are still waiting to get a table and have nothing better to do than to watch me eat. So we waited a few more minutes until a table near the kitchen was ready. We were seated under the air vents and they started to leak water! I'm pretty sure someone else complained because they quickly tried to wipe all the vents.  Service here is okay, nothing impeccable, but pretty standard for a restaurant food chain; you'll get your beverages refilled and fresh bread on the table so that's all I expected. Some of my favorite items on the menu is their Famous Factory Meatloaf, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, and Factory Burrito Grande. My go-to cheesecakes are the Fresh Strawberry cheesecake and the Adam's Peanut Buttercup Fudge Ripple cheesecake. The place is pretty noisy so it can be hard to have a conversation.

It's right next door to the huge Forever 21  which will be my next review (make sure to go here next). Wait time: Make sure you come either really late at night or early before lunch because I remember my tour guide driver mentioning that this is the busiest and most visited Cheesecake Factory around the world (not sure how true that is, but the wait line definitely felt that way)! Still worth it, you can even put your name down and then go to forever 21 next door that's what I did lol Service: I had the best server she was so nice and down to earth! I've never had bad experience waiter/waitress wise at Cheesecake Factory Food/drink: For food I highly recommend both the factory grande burrito and the spicy chicken chipotle pasta.

Dani S.,"Honolulu, HI",27,125,318,4.0,6/20/2016,"""Let them eat cheesecake! "" That's what Marie Antoinette would have said if she ate here.  This place serves much more than cheesecake. They serve burgers, pastas, salads, brunch items, girth expanding desserts and more.  The menu is huge.  Even the pickiest or healthiest eater can find something to eat.  I love the crab hash.  The kids brunch with French toast, bacon and fresh fruit is another good choice.  I always have my doubts about whether Mainland chain restaurants make their dishes to order, but the food here certainly tastes fresh and delicious.  The portions are generous.  I'm mostly a low carb eater, but I throw that out the window because this place is carb heaven. Before I forget I want to commend the excellent server we had today.  Blaine K. not only provided prompt service, but he even laughed sincerely at my husband's jokes which is much appreciated since today is Fathers Day and we wanted him to feel special.  The decor reminds me of some rustic Italian villa.  The lighting is good for those of us of a certain age who want flattering lighting, but it might be too dim for some. The only criticism I have of this particular Cheesecake Factory is the traffic flow.  It's very crowded and hectic. You get a pager until you're called which can range from 5 minutes to 1 hour.  You need to avoid peak hours or you'll have a long wait.  We only waited 10 minutes today, so it wasn't bad.  When the pager goes off, you get asked to stand near the hostess counter which is also near the stroller parking area while they find a server to seat you.  It's a narrow area not meant for a lot of people to be standing around. Meanwhile, there are many people entering and leaving the restaurant.

If you have a mad sweet tooth and veins of chocolate like me get the chocolate truffle tower. It's a ridiculously huge slice so I never finish it but I always take my left overs home with me! &though the food is great I had to drop a star for two things.... one, never go during dinner rush! They don't take reservations so you will more than likely be waiting a long time to be seated, especially if you have a big party. I've found that the in between lunch and dinner time is the best time to come if you wanna get seated right away. And secondly, pigeons! It's an open restaurant so if you're seated outside or near the outdoor patio you will definitely have some unexpected guests around. Once, a pigeon flew right over my head , so close I felt the air gush as it flapped over me. I hate pigeons! But easy solve, now we always ask to be seated inside lol.

Kimberly L.,"Honolulu, HI",92,285,189,4.0,12/4/2016,"I've dine here once, and have picked up Cheesecakes WAY more than I should (I do work next door). Anyways, I always thought they ONLY did pasta dishes because my friends always told me their pastas are good, but NOPE!  Cheesecake Factory (according to our server) makes everything using fresh ingredients. Their menu is ginormous. They have so many options, and the pages in the menu seem endless. I ended up going with pasta, my sister had a burger, one friend had the chicken parm, and the other one had a soup+salad combo. Everyone enjoyed. The service was good, and fast.  Price was pretty high end, but I expect that being in Waikiki. I usually do not order pasta because it's so cheap and the mark-up. I probably won't order a pasta next time, because my wallet can't handle that lol. But I'd try some of the other items.  Their cheesecake, you can order at the table or by the front where their displays are. They have a lot of variety you can pick from. I am also assuming all cheesecakes are also made from fresh ingredients every day. I like their texture because they're so light and airy, not the grocery store brand where it's heavy and thick. Sometimes they have seasonal flavors, like peppermint bark for Christmas season. Their Pumpkin spice sticks around from Oct-Dec.  Parking: Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center validates for them.  If you go for dinner, get there early. They can get packed and the wait can be for 2+ hours. I would avoid during long weekends or holidays.  ALSO if you have issues with tables being so closed to yours, you probably don't want to come here, as someone can be RIGHT behind you.

Lyla D.,"Honolulu, HI",541,1010,13815,4.0,7/31/2016,"This year, National Cheesecake Day was celebrated on July 30, 2016.  We heard about The Cheesecake Factory's special as they generously offered 50% discount off any of their cheesecakes for both Friday, July 29 and Saturday, July 30.  The special was limited to DINE-IN, ONLY. We always see lines and crowds waiting to get into The Cheesecake Factory in Waikīkī.  This location must truly be their flagship restaurant for its immense seating capacity and customer turnover.  Fortunately, this restaurant is located in the Royal Hawaiian Center where they offer free 2 hour parking validation. After we attending to some errands on Saturday morning, we drove into Waikīkī and arrived just before The Cheesecake Factory's 11:00AM opening.  There was a line of about 10 people that had formed in front of the restaurant. But, as soon as the doors opened, the friendly and cheerful hostesses quickly escorted the people to their seats, including us.   TCF's menu is filled with so many menu items that it is like reading a book and we took our time to ""study"" the menu.   Our server was so patient, cheerful and attentive. He checked with us often to refill our beverages and even tempted us by passing by with other customers' orders while we waited for our lunch buddy.  By the time Lora C arrived, we had made our menu decisions.  She quickly perused the menu as we steered her to consider the lunch specials because we kept in mind our plans to order cheesecake for dessert. THE FOOD: -Louisiana Chicken Pasta:   Parmesan crusted chicken served over bow-tie pasta with mushrooms, peppers, onions in a spicy New Orleans sauce. The Parmesan crusted chicken, according to Lora, was chicken breast meat that was crisp on the outside and juicy, tender inside.  The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente and the creamy ""spicy"" New Orleans sauce provided a nice complement to the crispy-crusted chicken.  As for spiciness, it wasn't spicy at all and barely had a chile kick but, the flavor was good.  The lunch special was priced at $14.95 whereas the dinner portion usually runs as $18.95. -Evelyn's Favorite Pasta:  Rigatoni topped with broccoli, oven-dried tomatoes, roasted eggplant, mushrooms, onions, artichokes, Kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts.  I always seem to order this pasta because of its flavorful Mediterranean flavors.  But, I really wish they hadn't removed their Indian Fry-Bread sandwich. I ordered the dinner portion as it was priced at $15.95, just a dollar more than the lunch special and got a larger portion that I could doggie bag for later snacking. -Renee's Special:  Half of a turkey sandwich came with today's special soup (Stuffed Baked Potato) and tossed green salad for only $12.95.  My husband enjoyed his turkey sandwich which was stuffed with fresh lettuce, tomatoes and lots of fresh baked turkey.  The stuffed baked potato soup was thick and tasted like a fully-loaded potato yet in a soup form. He must've enjoyed it as he cleaned his plate.   DESSERT:   -Mango Key Lime Cheesecake: this fluffy key-lime flavored cheesecake was topped with mango mousse and its crust was made from vanilla coconut macaroons.   We liked the mango flavor and subtle lime flavor.  The coconut macaroon crust was good but we felt it should have been more chewy rather than crisp but, to each his own.... -Lemon Meringue Cheesecake:  I am smitten by lemon and meringue desserts as its bright lemony flavor brings out Summer so this was my choice.  The lemon curd that was swirled into the fluffy, yet dense cream cheesecake gave it just the right amount of sweet and tart.  Plus, there was a layer of lemony mousse that brought this dessert together with the  meringue.  Yes, folks, I DID share this with my husband who isn't much of a dessert eater but somehow, it disappeared in front of him faster than me! Yay for National Cheesecake Day and I can't wait for it to come around next year.  We enjoy going to TCF and shouldn't just wait for this promotion to return and neither should YOU!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=80
Lora C.,"Honolulu, HI",269,416,3480,4.0,7/31/2016,"June 30th is National cheesecake day! They were having a promotion for 2 days July 29 and July 30 for 50% off slices of any slice of cheesecake DINE IN ONLY.. I love New York cheesecake, the creamy rich texture, so delicious! Calories that are so worth it all. I've had the authentic rich NY cheesecake while I was on a trip in New York and man I want those...  This is the only location on island and being that it is in Waikiki, the line is usually very long! Crowded, sometimes long wait. I was lucky because Lyla and Ed arrived when they opened, got a table. I truly appreciated them for waiting for me... while I took a good 30mins to get there. I got lost, missed the turn to the parking structure at Royal Hawaiian. Then made a wrong turn into a one way street YIKES! Being a local, Waikiki isn't just confusing for tourist hahah. But with all these one way streets, it makes you mad... you gotta start all over if you miss that one turn..  Finally, I made it. Cheesecake was on my mind for days!!! Since it was lunch time I got the Louisana Chicken which was $4 cheaper than the regular dinner price. the Louisiana chicken comes with bow tie pasta and chicken Parmesan. The sauce has a creamy spicy taste with some vegetables like onion and tomato. The chicken was juicy. Not overly cooked. Lyla got her usual.. Evelyn's Favorite. The pasta was light but good. I could see why she always order that.  Ed got the lunch special, Rene special (sandwich that comes with salad and a potato soup) wow what a deal. Portion was generous! The soup was yummy!  THE BEST PART: THE CHEESECAKE!!! Lyla ordered the lemon meringue cheesecake. I got the Mango keylime cheesecake. Now now we both wanted the sweet and sour yet savory of the cheesecake. I liked mine, although they should have asked if I wanted whip cream... I personally don't like whip cream in mostly anything. It's unwanted calories I could use towards other things. Let me tell you, first time trying this slice, my mango keylime cheesecake was mango-y with a kick of lime and that coconut macaroon crust went well together! It had lots of shredded coconut in every bite.  The lemon meringue was bold! I like that too! Thank you two for being so patient with me today!  You guys are always great company :)   Until we meet again amazing cheesecake.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=80

Derrick L.,"Mililani, HI",23,2,,2.0,10/23/2017,"We've been to this Waikiki Cheesecake Factory many times, and the service and food is always outstanding and is worth the 1 hour wait. We went there last night and was happy to know that the wait was only 30 minutes. Our waitress was Bianca who seemed more like a robot who showed very little personality, customer service and never smiled. Almost like she wanted off that night but was forced to work kind of attitude.  My wife was the only one that ordered a salad, which came quickly. But within 5 minutes our entrees arrived including hers. Why bring a person's entree when you just got your salad? When my wife told them that she's still eating her salad, the waiter asked if she'd like for them to hold her meal in the kitchen while she finished her salad. My wife agreed that would be best. About 5 minutes later Bianca told my wife it would be best if she could take her entree now or it'll be cold. It wasn't my wife's fault, so why the choice of either now or cold food? They should have made her a new dish when she was done with her salad. We also never got our complimentary bread as we usually got in the past.  When Bianca told us of the specialty cheesecakes, she rattled them off so quickly like it was something she was forced to do rather wanting to tell us about. We ordered our deserts and also one coffee. The deserts came but not the coffee.  Overall, the food was good as usual. I always order the chicken picatta, which I haven't found better at any other restaurant. It was just the service last night was terrible. That's why the wait was only 30 minutes, it's because they skip the bread, bring the food out while you're still eating the salad, and Bianca was just a waitress robot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=80

I went to the bar to have a drink.  The kids walked over to the newly opened International marketplace, which was directly across the street. We were seated slightly over the 25 minute time we were quoted.  Restaurant was extremely busy, but our server was very timely and remembered all the special requests that we made. We ordered our usual Kalua Pig Nachos, which is always fabulous!  There's some liquidy, gooey white cheese at the bottom of the plate....oh so yummy! For the first time, we ordered the deep fried mac and Cheese Balls.  Yum! My only complaint at this restaurant is just the fact that I have too many choices.  I always go through at least five selections and in the end, I always get the same thing.... Pasta Da Vinci.  I love it!  I just want to drink that sauce, sooooo good! Portions are so huge so we never have any cheesecake (although we stopped at Uncle Tetsu's at the nearby food court and picked up a cheesecake to go) You are pretty much guaranteed to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  So when you consider the portions, it's a pretty great deal and great for families.

We had shared a Smore's cheesecake, a red velvet cheesecake, and the kids had an ice cream sundae. Of course no one finished their dinner or their dessert and we all went home with doggy bags.

There's plenty of interesting things around to view while you're waiting though as it's located on the main strip. Our waiter Josh was an absolute legend! Attentive, friendly, and amazingly quick service- thanks so much Josh!  Ordered the chicken and biscuits and the meatloaf for our mains- we were both super impressed with the large sizes and home style taste. Nothing tastes like it's come from a giant chain!

About 10 minutes later, the original server brings everyone's doggy bags, but not mine. I see the busboy that took my plate and ask him if my food was packed. He actually blamed me, that I didn't say I wanted it packed. The nerve. I already asked my original server, who said she was coming back for my plate, my plate was more than half full, and shouldn't the worker ask ME if I wanted to take it home, especially with so much food on my plate?

Maile K.,"Honolulu, HI",56,143,477,5.0,4/10/2016,"Opted to have an dinner here due to unused gift cards. We decided to head over around 4:30pm on Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is known to get extremely busy between 5:30 and 6:00 pm. The wait can be excruciating, especially on an empty stomach.   We parked in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center garage, which, connects to the Sheraton's parking garage via stairs. (The validations are different for each lot, so mind the signs.) All parking fees in the RHSC garage must be pre-paid at the kisosk near the elevators in the garage. There is no parking attendant on duty down the ramp that you can pay, if you forget. Be prepared to walk a bit to the restaurant as the garage is at the other end of the shopping center. Upon our arrival to the restaurant at 4:45 pm, we were quickly seated. If you have a seating preference, state it to the hostess right away. The restrooms are located down a corridor before the kitchen.  The noise level is pretty loud. The menu. Extensive to say the least. Eggs and omelettes are served all day. There is a Sunday Brunch menu within the main menu, and also a lunch menu.  We began with house bread (sourdough and a dark oat bread) and butter, and an order of fried calamari. A bit on the salty side, but worked well with the garlic aioli and cocktail sauce. The morsels were lightly breaded and fried. Not at all chewy and tough. Very soft and pleasant to the palate. A+ Do not take the lunch menu lightly by expecting a tiny portion. You will be more wrong!  I chose the Chicken Piccata, lunch portion, because I wanted dessert, of course!  Three nice size pieces of the most flavorful, tender & juicy chicken in a lemon butter and caper sauce and a very generous portion of angel hair pasta.  A+ Limoncello Cream Torte traveled very nicely home. The whipped cream held up quite well and was very creamy. The cake was dense and sweet and the cream between the layers was tart. The frosting on the outside of the torte had some crunchies in it, which gave it a nice contrasting texture. A+ Just over an hour and we were out the door.

Jay T.,"Austin, TX",181,260,2057,4.0,3/15/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory because of their food; especially different cheesecake flavors!  The restaurant is located in the heart of Waikiki. Park at the Royal Hawaiian where the first hr is free w/ validation while the rest is $2/hr!   Cheesecake Factory is pretty spacious and can hold a lot of guests, although, not big enough for the non-stop traffic (both tourists and locals) in Waikiki. This is right next to forever 21 and across from Macy's, therefore, shopping while waiting is an option.  They do not take reservations and the lines are always long! But for someone surrounded by Asian and local restaurants and loves (everything else but that) American food, the wait is bearable for me. I've been to this restaurant a handful of times and never failed to receive good service. Ambiance is up to par and can be intimate in the evenings while food on the other hand is always good. They have great food varieties, although, my favorite appetizer personally is the avocado roll while salted caramel for the cheesecake, but of course those are both personal preference since everything, I think, is good. Lastly, you will also get your money's worth out of their alcohol beverages because it's strong! You can really taste the alcohol in it specifically in the margaritas. All in all, I recommend Cheesecake Factory with or without long wait times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=120
Dave F.,"Aiea, HI",776,414,2296,4.0,3/12/2017,"If the Cheesecake Factory weren't so darn far away I think I'd eat there more often!! They are located in Waikiki in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center on the ground level. Parking is pretty convenient in the parking garage. They don't take reservations so you have to go and sign in. You are probably going to wait to be seated, but while you are waiting you can go and check out all the cheesecakes they have for sale. The menu is quite extensive, with appetizers to full on meals, so take your time and choose carefully!! Many of the appetizer portions are big enough to share, so that's another way to order, you can share with your dining companions!! The pizzas and sandwiches are great, but my personal favorite happens to be an appetizer! You gotta have the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls. This is some serious deliciousness! It's served on a bed of deep fried long rice and served with two different sauces. Enough for two! The dining companion swears by the shrimp rolls, which isn't really a favorite of mine, but hey, to each his own!! We will usually order a pizza to split also. Great service and friendly interaction with the waitstaff make dining at Cheesecake Factory an enjoyable time. A little noisy in there, but a great place to sit down to some great food and conversation. If you're a big dessert fan, make sure you save some room for it since you're pretty much in dessert heaven!!

Let me tell you, it wasn't pesto. It was more like, butter sauce drizzled with parsley flakes and with tablespoon of salt. Boy, it was so salty and a piggy myself could not even finish it. The eggplant was really oily but it was good because of the mozzarella cheese.

Yes the wait will be about an hour but this place had the best food of anyone on the strip and we had two weeks to cruise all of the big ones. I had the chicken Madeira, shrimp scampi, Steak Diane, hibachi steak, and potstickers. Obviously not at once but over the course of our time in Waikiki. The steaks are amazing! One of the best steaks I've ever had and that includes some of the bigger steakhousss that serve sides ala carte! Sounds weird for a big, busy chain but it's true. I asked for A1 sauce for my steak the first night and ended up not even needing it cuz there was already so much flavor. Plus, it was cooked exactly how I ordered it! It's rare that everyone gets their food and loved their meal every single time! Do I even need to mention their delicious cheesecakes?! They do have a walk up counter to order cheesecake only to go! Convenient if u just want a dessert. Plus our servers were awesome every night. Very attentive and super helpful choosing from the menu (both entrees and drinks). They are ALWAYs busy but they were on top of drinks and our other requests. Food came out within a reasonable time but drinks can take a while if the bar is busy. Speaking of drinks, they were strong. I enjoyed the pineapple and cucumber mojitos. The wait is long (but the wait area is large and right on the main drag) but I hate to say that the best meals I had were here and I'd come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=120

Mel B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",353,601,5767,3.0,3/2/2016,"if you can't get street parking, your best bet is at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.  The first hour, if validated, is free.  After that it's $2 an hour.  If you don't like that and can't figure out the math, you could park at the Waikiki Shopping Plaza where it's a flat fee of $5.00 total. So glad Judy recruited Frankie to get there early to put in our reservation.  So, the plan was the table would be ready to receive us by 7:00pm.  We arrive then, sit, order and enjoy.  You know how the best laid plans are easily laid to waste?  Guilty as charged.  I was the last to arrive close to 8pm.  Embarassing yes?  I needed a drink. Lemon Drop Martini $12.25 This was sweeter than normal, I think.  How'd they do that?  Well, it was good for me.  Pricey though. Everyone ordered immediately but I wasn't hungry.  I was trying to get something light besides salad but couldn't find anything.  Not even in the appetizer section either. Baja Chicken Tacos $14.95 These came in a group of 4.  I know I cannot expect these to be as good as the Tijuana street tacos I got for 80 cents but one could hope. Maybe I was hoping too much.  Although many of the flavors were there I found the tacos dry.  Note to self: bring my own salsa.  Maybe. This seems to be the problem many times when I visit Cheesecake Factory no matter where I go. Everything looks good, tastes good but is missing something missing the mark.   However, the cheescakes are devine.  They are pricey too so I only come if I want to treat myself and if it's convenient to get to.  This location is not convenient.  Back to making my own.

Not everyone that comes here come for the cheesecake(I'm partial to that) but the food and service is so good we don't really care that you even have cheesecake most of the time. The cheesecake selection is the cherry on top of your great experience your bound to have.  My BIGGEST recommendation is to go early for dinner, I don't care what day of the week it is. I'd say on average what time is 30-45min on a good day. It's not unusual to wait almost 2hrs for dinners on the weekends  and it normally doesn't turn anyone away and that in itself speaks for this place.

I have to say that out of all of the restaurants that we have eaten at, this experience was the worse!!! We had a party of 16 people so didn't mind the wait to be seated. However, after being seated,we did not get our food orders taken until an hour and 10 minutes later. The first waitress took our orders for drinks as soon as we were seated. However, though she passed our table several times to wait on other tables, she never returned to our table or even acknowledged that we were sitting there.  Only after stopping a waitress who just happened to be passing by our table did we finally get our orders taken and then we never saw her again. A third waiter kept filling us up with bread and butter. We never knew who exactly was assigned to our table. I asked to speak to a manager and the manager was condescendingly polite and nonchalant as if he could care less. We received no apology or compensation for the poor service and long wait. We were VERY disappointed after hearing so much about this supposedly great restaurant. It did not live up to the reputation. Maybe they just can't handle large parties.

Nani G.,"Honolulu, HI",14,127,85,2.0,3/28/2016,"Where have the good old days gone?  This is my second visit in less than a week.  It is still a crazy place to get seated.  My wait was only 55 minutes or so today which isn't bad compared to other days. My waiter was Mark from the Big Island and he was upbeat and courteous with all his interactions.  I was having issues with my voice and he didn't hesitate to lean in to hear what I was trying to say.  My interaction with him was probably the best part of my experience at The Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was okay.  Some of the artichoke hearts completely missed the blade in the blender.  It didn't have much flavor, but the salty tortilla chips helped it out.  My favorite dish here is Chicken Madiera so it is my ""go to meal.""  Last week the chicken breasts were smaller and the sauce was salty, but the potatoes helped absorb that and the meal balanced out.  Today though there was barely any wine sauce and I think I had at least half a pound of mushrooms on top of my chicken breasts.  The chicken breast was tender as usual and the asparagus was its usual as well.  I only had three bites and debated on whether to get something else, but didn't. Tonight the meal fell flat so I decided to just go for dessert and take the meal home. My excitement quickly subsided as I looked over the menu.  I was even more disappointed in the cheesecake selection.  They seem to have removed a large selection and the ones available were not up to my standards.  There was only one cheesecake with coconut and it had more chocolate than coconut.  I looked tirelessly for the pineapple upside down cheesecake and lo and behold it is gone too.   Overall if it was not for the service Mark gave me, I'd be giving them one star.  This is not the quality of what I am used to from The Cheesecake Factory and I doubt I will be coming back here any time soon .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=140
Monica F.,"Toronto, Canada",34,149,810,5.0,2/5/2016,"There's a reason why this place is so popular... Cheesecake Factory is the bomb! I wish we had them in Canada. We were here 4 times during our 10 day trip in Honolulu. And came by once just for cheesecake, lol.  Their menu is so huge, it takes a while to decide what you're going to get. Would be a great place for picky eaters since they're bound to find something here they'd enjoy. And the prices are very fair, considering the area.  I had the Cajun chicken ""littles"" twice, they were that good. I think they put quotations beside the word ""little"" on the menu because it's anything but. You get like, 10 pieces of chicken, it's ridiculous. They are basically chicken fingers served with mashed potatoes and corn succotash. I appreciate how they serve the chicken with vegetables as opposed to French fries cause the chicken is already fried (although I'm sure I could have substituted for fries if I wanted to).  I also had the best burger I've ever had in my LIFE here for our last meal in Honolulu-- the Americana Burger. I think it's their version of a Big Mac cause it's got that thousand islands ""secret sauce"" on it. I don't know if I'll ever be able to have a McDonald's Big Mac again.... Holy cow.    I also got the chicken parm sandwich, which was good, but the least favourite thing I ordered there. I didn't like the roasted peppers that came with it.  My dad got the Cuban sandwich, which was the least favourite thing he ordered (maybe sandwiches aren't their strongest suit?), the steak Diane, chicken Madeina, and the chicken parm with pasta. His favourite was the chicken Madeina. I had a taste of it and it was really good. They sure don't skimp on the cheese!  I tried the Oreo and turtles cheesecake too, and Oreo is definitely the way to go. It's one of the most popular cheesecakes. It was funny cause I was all like ""what a chincy size slice for $9"" but I couldn't even finish it. Soooo good.  Apparently this is the highest grossing Cheesecake Factory in the world. It was packed at all hours of the day we were there/passed by. The staff here know what they're doing though. It's very efficiently run.

Ash C.,"Honolulu, HI",379,262,3613,3.0,7/27/2016,"Everyone and their mama knows about Cheesecake Factory. It's probably one of the biggest food chains across the country. That's probably one of the main reasons why it's always so busy. If you come here for lunch, wait times are actually good. Usually if you get there before noon, you can get sat right away. But if you come here for dinner, you better eat like a side meal or bring a snack because wait times can go up to almost 2 hours! And sometimes they even run out of pagers, so they just give you a piece of paper and ask you to come back later for a pager. Cheesecake Factory has a very large and expansive menu, over 250 dishes! They have everything: lunch specials (served until 5pm), breakfast all day, burgers, regular entrees, alcohol and CHEESECAKE for dessert. I normally come here for lunch with my coworkers and we usually take advantage of their lunch specials. They have couple options on their menu that comes in lunch-size portions: salad, soup and salad, salad and pizza, pasta, chicken, salmon and other specialties for reasonable pricing. I normally get the salad and pizza (BBQ Chicken Pizza is my favorite) as I always end up taking home leftovers because the portions are large for me. My boyfriend usually appreciates when I have leftover pizza for him to eat lol. And of course you can't forget about their famous cheesecakes. I normally don't make it to dessert, but they have over 30 different flavors. And depending on the season, they may have special flavors to try.   On my most recent visit, we came here for dinner around 6pm for a party of 8. The wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes. OMG. But since this is where the birthday girl wanted to go, we decided to walk around Waikiki and just wait. We luckily got buzzed 15 minutes earlier, but because our big group split up during the wait, only 3 of us were able to make it back to the restaurant first. They wouldn't sit us until half our party was there. A bit ridiculous if you ask me as we were already waiting for so long. We told them they were in the area and on their way, but they still wouldn't sit us. So as we waited for the rest of our party to show up, we prayed they didn't give our table away.  After we finally got sat, the first thing everyone asked was ""are the lights on?"" It was so dark, we had to use the flashlight off our phones to see the menu better. On top of that, our waiter, Brian I think was his name, was the real MVP (sarcasm). When he finally took our orders, he would take down 2 orders, then disappear, and then show up again, and then disappear again. It was quite annoying as he did that with our water refills too. And when we asked if it was possible to split the check, he tried to make us feel bad by saying it'll take longer to split. And before he left to place our orders, he made another comment that he thought was funny by saying ""I had to stop my temptations to tell you I can't split the check."" I know I probably gave him the death stare after he said that because that was just rude! After we got our food, he was non-existent until we got our bill. The only highlight of that night was there was live entertainment that played oldies but goodies songs.  Other than that rude waiter, the food here is actually not too bad. I did like the Chicken Madeira. The chicken was tender, had lots of mushrooms and asparagus and the sauce was delicious. I liked the cheese, but it may have been too much cheese on the chicken. Their Miso Salmon is another favorite of mines. As for their cheesecakes, my favorite is probably their Pineapple Upside Down cheesecake. And I recently tried their Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake. It looks really rich, but it was actually light and fluffy. And it came with a huge oreo cookie on top! Customer service isn't the greatest here as on other occasions, service is usually slow, even during lunch time when it's not too busy. But I usually come back here because of the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=140

Our meal cost a total of $103.78 and tip an extra $16. I ordered the chicken katsu and it just melted in my mouth. I love how the sauces go so well together, it had a hint of Sriracha on the side which gave it a kick of spicy. We got good customer service and complimentary bread.

Portions are massive and always good to share. While I'm not a huge fan of ""chain restaurants"" I do enjoy few things on the Cheesecake Factory menu.  This past Valentine's Day weekend we did a staycation in Waikiki. It was in our plans to shop around Riyal Hawaiian while we waited the hour plus for a two top. But luckily, the bf spotted two sweet seats at the bar. Score! I struggled with what to order since you know the menu is a freakin' novel with advertisements in them too. Lol. After a few sips of my Long Island Ice Tea I decided on the lunch special with choice of pizza and salad. I ordered the Caesar Salad and Chicken Sausage Pizza. All of the staff there said it was a great choice as that combo one of their all time faves. BF ordered his usual Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Yummers!

Most of the servers were great: friendly, fast, very attentive and caring: Jeffery, Theresa, Michelle, Sontamo (sp?) to name a few. I put 4 stars only because of 2 servers we had last 2 times we dined there: one didn't introduce herself and was very arrogant and inattentive (brought water with ice although we clearly asked without ice) and Sacarra M, whose face expressed annoyance with everyone and everything around her, she didn't smile even once and made us feel very unwelcome, like as if she couldn't wait to get rid of us.

Serena M.,"Honolulu, HI",50,187,873,3.0,7/11/2016,"Going to Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night is something I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It was so crowded and so many people were just waiting for a table. People were being told that the wait was two hours long! Luckily we outsmarted them and called ahead to make reservations. We just had to wait 15 minutes for our table.  Cheesecake Factory has a very long extensive menu and it was difficult to decide what to eat. I have so many food restrictions in my diet and many of their items are on my do not eat list. I decided on Fettucine Alfredo. My husband and our friend got the Hibachi Steak. He was originally going to get a burger but changed his mind because of our waiter.  Our waiter was a very charismatic guy. He made us feel very welcomed when he greeted us at the table and he shared the staff favorites. One of them was the Hibachi Steak. He raved about the sauce and the meat and that sold my husband. So no burger and instead he got the steak.  My husband really enjoyed his steak. I didn't really care for my Alfredo. It seemed like it was lacking something, like pepper or something. It tasted so plain.

So we basically came in at the perfect time but when we left after 430ish PM they eventually got a line & people were waiting. Our male server (forgot his name :( ) was amazing until we got another server, which a woman took his place. We first started off with 3 appetizers with him. We started off with the fried calamari, the spicy ahi tempura roll & fried Mac & cheese. When he came back to check up on us & asked if we wanted to order any entrees, we were not ready & decided to take time to eat the appetizers. About 30 minutes in, I believe, that's when our servers got switched. She asked if we been here before & I said I been here before but it was my boyfriends first time here. Towards the ending of our food, she said something like ya you never been here before something like that which I took that as a rude compliment. Like I'm from here & I been here like a long time ago & yes I did say that I been here before but she didn't have to accuse me of lying that I never had been here before. I totally forgot that the plates were big & that she didn't have to make such a rude remark. Even my boyfriend said that was rude of her for saying such a thing, but whatever's. For a skinny girl like me, I had ordered 2 lunch specials which was the pasta & salmon. I ended up only eating half of my miso salmon & a few bites of my pasta.

Mandy Lee H.,"Honolulu, HI",90,76,283,3.0,11/8/2015,"Expect for a long wait! The wait is usually around 45 minutes for dinner whenever we visit, the wait tonight was 1 hour and 40 minutes for a booth (Saturday night). I suggest shopping around the area to pass the time; there is not a lot of seating space near the restaurant where you can wait. There are some benches along the side of the restaurant and a rock wall near the street where people often wait.  When we got to our table, they were in the middle of clearing the previous meal. We waited to the side. The hostess apologized and chatted with us so the wait wasn't as awkward... then after a bit, excused herself to help the others clear our table.  We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese, and fried calamari as our appetizers. The fried macaroni is my favorite appetizer, there are 4 deep fried macaroni and cheese balls, served with a delicious creamy marinara sauce.  The server could have been better. There was a problem where one of our entrees was taking a while to come out, but assured us that our meal was on the top of the priority list. He even offered us a soup or salad while we waited (we denied), which was nice. We ordered the chicken piccata and the bistro shrimp pasta, which were both very delicious.  At the end of our meal, we placed our parking ticket with our credit card when paying our check, and later found out that it was not validated and we had to pay the full price of parking. This was the first time we had this problem, hopefully this was a mindless mistake and it hardly happens to other people.

Tishana G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,27,8,1.0,6/4/2017,"Updated Review:  My fiancé and I called ahead to make reservations for a group of 6. The lady that answered said they do not take rsvps and that in order to get a table, we would have to walk in. We arrived at about 5:30 and told the ladies at the front desk that we were having 6 people. She gave us a pager and said that we would be seated in about 30 minutes. We went to the bar to drink. Bryce was our bartender and the only good thing to come out of our dinner there. He was very chill and made our drinks to perfection (5 stars for Bryce). Our friends forgot their wallet in their car and left for 5 minutes to get it. (Their car was in the parking garage by Ross). The pager beeped and we went to get seated. The usher gave us a SUPER hard time about our table EVEN THOUGH OUR PARTY WAS THERE and told us we only could have a 5 minute wait window otherwise he would give up our table and we would have to wait on the list AGAIN. I told him nicely that they went to get their wallet and we still had 4 of the 6 there already. He still wouldn't sit us! Finally after a lot of going back and forth and he saw our party, he finally sat us and had an attitude about it. I asked him to get me a manager because I did not appreciate him being an a**hole to me or my party (manager never made it to our table).  Our server was ""interesting"". We waited about 20 minutes for our first round of drinks and water. Everytime we tried to order the next round of drinks, she would only take 2 orders and leave the table. My girlfriend and I waited over 30 minutes just to order another set of daiquiris! Same thing for the food order (she took half the party's order then left and took the rest). One of our friends waited 30 minutes after we got our appetizers and entrees before her food got to us.

After talking about it for months since my husband has never eaten here and it's been years since I've eaten here. We finally put the talk into action and drove all the way into Waikiki. Not that it's hours of driving but when you live on Oahu anything not 10min away is a long drive...haha. Parking is in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. We failed to do our research and ended up in line at their prime time on a Sunday evening. The wait time was 45min. Normally, we wouldn't wait that long for a table, but we drove all this way for some cheesecake and we were not back out now. Upon check-in, you're given a pager. Luckily, there are several places in that area, so the wait time didn't seem too bad. We walked around the shopping center.  Next thing you know, we're being paged. So off we head to the front of the line, handed our pager over and was guided to wait on the side to wait for our someone to seat us. Once our name was called, we anxiously followed our hostess to our seat. How disappointing it was to be seated just behind the counter at the bar. It was loud and very dim. I'm not sure if the rest of the restaurant is as dim but it was dark enough that I had to hold the menu up close to read it. After waiting all that time, we opted to have our dessert first. I was pretty adamant about that because when we go out to eat we usually are so stuffed from our food that we end up passing on the dessert...well not this time. I had the white chocolate raspberry truffle and my husband had the Salted caramel. Both were delicious but I thoroughly enjoyed mine better. You can not go wrong with white chocolate and raspberry in my opinion. We then ordered the Kalua pork nachos...so yummy, so yummy! After skimming through the menu, I was so undecided on what I wanted to eat because there was so much to choose from. I decided to wait, since the nacho portion size was so big. My husband ordered the Hibachi steak. And it was very flavorful. I had a few bites of my hubbys plate and opted not to order a meal because I was stuffed. Of course we ordered a cheesecake to go, we went with the dutch apple caramel streusel. My husband swears he had his cheesecake fix. But I found my cheesecake the next day half eaten by him.  Overall, the food and cheesecake was awesome. We will definitely return, but I'll make sure to request seating outside of the bar area because it was hard to hold a conversation even though we were sitting right across the table from each other.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=180

Rachel D.,"San Diego, CA",18,23,8,4.0,2/13/2017,"I don't know what it is about the cheesecake factory, but we like coming here and splurging every once in a while on a piece of cheesecake. The ladies at the front are always rude but we still insist on coming back here lol!  We don't come here for the food because we did have a bad experience once, so cheesecake it is. They also validate parking for Waikiki shopping plaza down the street, so that's a big plus.

THEN our waiter, Kristy(?), acted a little unusual when talking to us. After we ate our food, we waited a good 30 minutes for her to offer us any dessert or if we wanted anything else. So we basically sat in our seats waiting for her. The two tables next to us were waiting for to-go boxes and their bill as well. She didn't come back for quite some time and we told the host. When she finally came back, we ordered dessert and it took her 15 minutes to come back to our table every time we needed something. We were always looking for her.

Julia A.,"Honolulu, HI",1,8,7,1.0,11/3/2017,"If I could rate this 0 starts I would. I usually like coming here and have decent service. But the service I just recently had was so horrible. There were so many horrible things that the server has done, her name's Nicole. First of all, when she was giving our water, she didn't come to our table. She passed it over the little gate they had between the table and walk way. Secondly, when we were ordering our food she didn't repeat our orders back to us, so when we received our meal it was wrong. My friend ordered sweet potato fries instead and my other friend got a well done burger but got a medium well. Also, when I got my pasta they didn't offer if I wanted cheese..since that's why they usually would ask. So when she came back she just DRAGGED my plate which pushed my utensils to the side and made a loud noise. Like excuse me?! After that I was just so irritated. It was my friend's first time at cheesecake so he wanted to order a cheesecake but our server DID NOT INFORM us that she's taking last call for food or cheesecake. She just gave us our checks so I asked her if we could order cheesecake and she says ""they just closed, sorry about that."" We was so pissed, HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW WHEN LAST CALL IS?! I don't know if she's new or what but she was so horrible. So beware for shitty service if you do get this girl.

My girlfriend got the slider appetizer and she couldn't eat all of it i had to help her but still couldn't finish it. I got the 4 cheese pasta with chicken and left 20% on the plate i couldn't finish that either, the neiboring guest at tables around us also had very large serving sizes so if your hungry you can not go wrong here! The seating layout of the restaurant is one of the largest if not the largest in waikiki from what i have seen, its massive. it does get very very busy but we had lunch around midday and had to wait about 3 minutes for a table. The lighting inside of the restaurant is slightly dim and the design isnt so modern but fits the island feel with the pineapple style lamps lol. We ordered the oreo cheesecake to share as we both are pretty full, it was a big slice and very rich. Was really good though We ordered. 2 x cokes $6 (free free fills) 1 x oreo cheese cake $8.50 4 cheese pasta w/chicken $17.50 1 x chicken sliders delux $12.95 Total of $47.07 (without 15% tip) and we are FULL!

Jessica P.,"Honolulu, HI",302,309,3405,3.0,9/11/2015,"It's been a couple years since I last dined in at Cheesecake and that was in Sherman Oaks, CA for lunch. On that particular visit, the complimentary bread and Chicken Marsala were very delicious. It was so good, it made my Instagram feed (104 weeks ago! Lol). So, I wanted to recreate the experience in Waikiki. At 6:45pm on a Wednesday, the quoted wait time was 30 mins. It was VERY CROWDED inside and out. But, there are plenty of great stores in the vicinity to check out. Or, you can stand in line at the Cheesecake/Take-Out counter to order dessert in advance! Three words: Lemoncello Creme Torte. Our pager buzzed within 30 mins, as quoted, but that was really deceiving. We still had to wait another 15 mins once we turned in our pager. There were at least 20 other customers waiting, too. For a moment we thought they forgot about us, so we inquired with one of the hostesses. She explained, once we turn in the pager, it means that our table is being prepared [not ready!]. They will call us by name when our table is ready. So, this tall, handsome young man finally calls our party of 2. He was probably the most calm, sincere, and friendly host as we walked from the front to the back of the restaurant. As we approached our table, he asked that we stand to the side to wait a few more moments as they prepare our table. Ha! I don't know if the restaurant always operates like this, but here's an idea: page/buzz customers when the table is actually ready! Our server tended to us quickly, but at times was talking way too fast I could barely comprehend what he was saying. I felt like the restaurant suckered us in falsely advertising a ""short"" wait time and now we're being rushed to order. Well, it took another 45 mins to receive our entrees - maybe that's why he was talking fast. So in the meantime, we snacked on the complimentary bread, which was not as fresh as I remember.  Chicken Marsala. The dinner serving was large enough to share between 2-3 people!! So, I ended up packing 3/4 of the plate for home. The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente (which I like). The chicken was tender. The combination of the Marsala sauce and mushrooms was divine. However, after eating a few bites, I was already full (darn you, bread!). We also had Fried Calamari. That was actually excellent. Definitely at the top of my list for best calamari in town! Highly recommend it!! If you're willing to wait, the entrees are as great as I can remember. No military or kamaaina discounts available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=200
Amy Y.,"Honolulu, HI",303,689,1336,3.0,4/22/2016,"My second time here and holy snap, no wonder I don't come here that much. The wait is ridiculous. When you come during those peak hours, you wait longer than expected. My friend came around 6:30PM on a Saturday night and put down her name for a table of 10. It was a hella long 3 hours wait. It's insane. Was it worth it? To me, not really. The hostess said 2 and a half hours and it ended up to 3 hours. So we basically ate dinner at 9:15 PM. We were all starving like cows!  We were all excited after the beeper vibrated. We walked inside and was seated all the way in the back of the restaurant. As soon as we sat down we already know what we wanted to order. When we saw the waitress, my friend instantly requested for water and tons of bread for all of us...literally. 10 minutes later our bread came and there was only one basket of it. That's it?! The kitchen was backed up so it was slow. We asked for more bread (white and brown). It came with butter. I loved the brown bread. It was soft and yummy. 10 minutes later our appetizer came. We shared a avocado spring roll. It came with about 6 rolls with sweet and sour dipping sauce. It tasted pretty good. Spring rolls stuffed with avocado. Need the sauce with it or it'll be bland and dry. 15-20 minutes later our main entree came. I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (rigatoni, with veggies). So, I shall complain now. The rigatoni was not even fully cooked. It wasn't soft. The pasta tasted like oil and seasoning mixed together. It wasn't even special. I'm so disappointed. I wasn't able to finish it so I took it home. It's true, maybe they are known for the cheesecake and not the food. I was full from bread so I wasn't able to order the cheesecake.  Next time if I come to cheesecake factory, I'm doing take out. Cheesecake take out is available too on the side. It's much more faster! I'm done with the experience. Service was slow, but I understand it's busy. Maybe they should hire more servers? Sometimes I don't get why tourist from the mainland wants cheesecake factory here when they get a lot of it on the mainland.

Tina B.,"Clovis, CA",87,2,,1.0,6/7/2017,"We called ahead for a table for 6 and was given a 45 min wait time. Misquoted by 1 hour of when we would be seated. Told us 45 mins and we had to wait 1hour and 45 mins. We were then sat all the way in the back of the patio, it's hot and stuffy and the temperature difference from walking through the restaurant to where they sat us was at least 10-15 degrees. I tried to move us to the table near an opening to outside instead of the wall and rudely was told ""You can't just move, there may be someone else assigned to the table!""   When I asked if there were any other tables inside I was told it would be another 20 mins. NO WAY! So we sat in the dark stuffy corner (on our family vacation - once in a lifetime trip in HI with all 4 of my kids)  Turns out ""rude guy"" was our server... I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken and the server said they were out of that. I was starting to think I was being filmed on WWYD? I ended up ordering appetizers since I didn't want anything else on the menu. He just gave me a disgusted look, shook his head and asked ""you don't want ANYTHING else?"" ... are you kidding me. The manager came over a few mins later and said he ""heard"" we were not happy.  I explained the ridiculous long wait, the unfavorable table, the chicken that I ordered was out. He apologized for the chicken being out of stock and again offered me to order something else. When I told him ""no thank you"" he offered me complimentary cheesecake. Not for the 3 of of us that ordered cheesecake but just 1. It was an anniversary trip, family vacation. We had bad services, unfriendly staff and food is mediocre.

This place opened at 11am and we were 2 of a total of 14 people that waited for the place to open. By the time we left which was 45min later this place was probably about half full... yes it is popular so if you want to try it I'd recommend to go when they open, at least this way you can decide whether you want to sit inside or outside.

The wait staff is very attentive to children and my girls (11) and (9) feel welcomed. The calamari appetizer is very good. Crisp with lots of taste.

Magi D.,"Honolulu, HI",67,113,78,3.0,6/20/2017,"As a local, I rather dine anywhere in Waikiki. But I had a staycation the other weekend so of course my boyfriend and I dined in Waikiki. There are so much food places to choose from in Waikiki, but we settled on this establishment because we both agreed that it's been years since either one of us ate here. As always, there's a lot of people waiting and there is almost always a wait time. But for a party of two, we waited about 15-20 minutes which isn't that bad at all. We were seated promptly and was given water. I kind of fell in love with their Shepards Pie! The first time I had one was when I visited Canada and I was searching high and low for a place that serves it. Though of course it wasn't the same, but hey, it was so good and I was very contented with that calorie-filled meal! I love how they have lunch specials of certain food items, which is just a smaller portion  Considering that this place is always packed with people, the service was alright, not the best and not the worse. As long as I get my water refilled and the check in a timely manner, then I'm fine (which our server did very well). We didn't get any cheesecake for dessert (I had it once before, though it was good, I'm not a fan of cheesecake-well my stomach isn't LOL).

Nice non-alcoholic beverage menu (not just soft drinks, all sorts of fresh lemonades) as well as a solid alcohol selection. CHEESECAKE GALORE!  They'll validate your parking.  Outdoor seating available.  Cons: This place is packed around dinner time and we've experienced 90 minute waits. The upside is that if you snatch a seat at the bar or bar hightop tables, you can order dinner there and skip the wait.  Loud. Not the place for a super romantic dinner. This is the place to go if you already know the person you are with and don't really care to learn new things about them tonight. Crowds.

LoReatha G.,"Honolulu, HI",55,17,17,1.0,11/11/2016,"Absolutely horrible service!!! Went out on a Friday night with a group of 12 (10 adults 2 kids). We knew it would be awhile to be seated so we waited an hour and half so we could all sit together. While we waited, we saw plenty of smaller tables open up but waited to sit together and the hostess kept reassuring us that we could sit together as well. When we were finally called to be seated, we were ushered to TWO BOOTHS that were back to back that sat 6 each. Really?!?!?! Why did we wait for an hour and a half while looking at various empty 6 tops??  But ok. We decided to grin and bear it and sat down. There was one kid at each table. We decided to order the kids meals first since we had waited quite a while and they were getting antsy. Those were placed and then my table ordered all the drinks and appetizers. We got our drinks and then decided to order our dinner. The table I sat at received 2 appetizers in about 20min. We did not care for the deep fried macaroni since it was burnt and wanted to send it back. So we waited and waited and waited for the waitress to come back. We she finally came back we decided to ask about the kids meal since it has yet to come out. She said she would find out, get us refills and then she disappeared again.  An hour and some change after we sat down we have no food, no drinks, no kids meal and burnt macaroni balls. We are all getting agitated because the little girl at my table was starting to get fussy as well. Waitress comes back, without refills and says she apologizes but they are waiting for my Filet Mignon to finish. I laughed because I ordered it medium rare and two people ordered salads. Waiting for it to cook? After this comment my friends were over it. The manager did not offer much condolence since he stated he could not locate our food or drinks. We asked for our checks, cashed out and left.  The funny part is, our partner table had FINISHED their meals by the time we got fed up and decided to leave. I will never visit Cheesecake Factory again. Shortening the menu will do wonders for your service. I must say, Wendy's on Nimitz offered a great baconator combo for the car ride home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=220

We ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad, two Chicken Piccatas, Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict and a Kids' Spaghetti w/Meatball. For beverages, we had the Arnold Palmer.   Let me first begin with no bread. The kids' Spaghetti arrived after 15 minutes. Then, another 20 minute wait came the entrees, but no salad.  We asked Eric H. for bread and about the salad.  He said that he thought we wanted the Chicken Piccatas instead of the Chinese Chicken Salad, but what he ""thought"" and what we said were not the same.   Service was very slow. Very Disappointing!  This was a terrible dining experience! Not how I remember the Cheesecake Factory Waikiki in the past.  We wanted to order Cheesecakes, but decided to order it on our way out at the counter display because we didn't want to wait another 20+ minutes.   The entrees were good, but the Arnold Palmers and Shirley Temples were terrible.

Kainani K.,"Honolulu, HI",102,14,17,1.0,3/19/2017,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory with my husband tonight, and it was really busy as expected. The things that I didn't like was the fact that one person was writing times on a receipt for people to come back for pagers while the other worker was giving out pagers and taking people's information down. After waiting 20+ minutes, I noticed that a waiter walked toward the line of people who were waiting to put their name down, and pulled 2 women who hasn't put their name down yet and proceeded to seat them. I was upset because everyone else had to wait a long time and these two women were bypassing all of this. I brought it up to the women working the front desk and was told that busboys sometimes pulls people for the back bar when seats become available- this would've been believable if he didn't bypass other people to do so as well as bypass people that had already put their names down. One of the managers overheard me and offered to sit me immediately. However, shortly after ordering my food another manager comes to the table and says that they ran out of the dish I ordered- I was already irritated at the lies being told earlier so I just ordered something else. I ended up not liking my food and told the waiter but I was still charged for it. I just wanted to get out of there so I just paid for the bill..

Jane H.,"Portland, OR",2,32,99,1.0,12/18/2016,"Posted on Yelp 12/10/16 Saturday night. My friends & I decided to eat at this place the night before the Honolulu marathon. Our waitress was the WORST & the MANAGER was too!!! They were both ignorant, arrogant, & rude!!! 1. My friend & I decided to share our food, ordering a pizza & pasta. When she took our order, we told her that we wanted the BBQ pizza & the garlic noodles but with a creamy sauce instead. She said she wasn't sure if that can be done bc it will change the taste but I told her it was ok if it did. She tried to argue with me what I wanted so she said she'll ask the chef (she had an attitude at this time) When she came back, she brought out the manager (Marshall).  I explained to him that we liked what's included in the pasta (fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, oven-roasted tomatoes) but to change the sauce to creamy. He recommended the Pasta carbonara, I told him that yes I like the sauce but I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies. He said the veggies was not the problem for cost but for the sauce.  Sauce in Hawaii is expensive.  I repeated myself telling him that I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies & he said ""yes"" 2. Free bread was brought out & of course we ate it leaving couple of the darker ones,so when she came around she saw that someone else already brought out the bread  so she skipped us.  I flagged her down & ask if we can get more bread.  She looked at me with an ugly, mean attitude 'like seriously, you wanted more bread look'.  Even my friends saw her look & was surprise. 3. Food came out, all was good. 4. Obviously we couldn't eat all of our pizza & pasta so I asked her if we could get some boxes & she said ""what??""  With an ugly, nasty attitude!!! Again, we all looked at each other & said what is her problem??!! 5. The Check came out - We were charged (not a surprise! )for the veggies that I specifically told the manager Marshall before placing my order that I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies! She said it was the manager who rang our check. Low & behold, he came out telling me that ""this is a one time courtesy that he was not charging for the veggies"" I told him that I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies & he agreed not to charge me before I placed my order. He had the audacity to say that he didn't say that, he said that veggies are expensive.  What the HELL!!! He basically called me a liar!!! We were all stunned by what he said!  I told him that I will not be coming back & he basically said whatever & didn't give a $hit!! Seriously the worst service by the waitress & the manager by the name of Marshall!!!! I understand that they get a lot of tourist & they probably don't give a damn for all the tourist but please don't lie to the people who pays for your salary!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=240

Chanel M.,"Mililani, HI",70,70,27,4.0,2/28/2016,I came last night and i love the food here. Super good. I had the four cheese pasta n thats delicious if you love cheese. I also had the caesar salad and a oreo cheesecake. Yummy! Just the cheesecake is very sweet though. So i dont recommend eating it you have diabetes or something.  The only downfall i have here is how they dont take reservations. I know its a busy restraunt but to me they should take reservations for big parties at least if they really dont want to except reservations. Since they dont take reservations our wait was 2.5 hours long. We didnt get seated till 9:50pm. I had a party of 18 of us and all of us was getting grouchy because we was all hungry and we had to wait that long. I find it ridiculous of how long the wait is.  There was also one more thing that happened that night. My boyfriend had ordered a filet mignon and we was wondering how come his food didnt come yet because all of ours did and they told him that they gave his food away  even more so i was like wth. But it was nice of them to offere him a soup or salad to wait cause they had to remake his food so even more long he had to wait to eat. Remember we was already waiting 2.5 hours and then he had to wait even longer for him to get his food. I felt bad for him cause he was really hungry and that happened.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=240

The place is always packed with people waiting in line as bookings cannot be guaranteed.  The atmosphere is frantic - and the staff numbers required to serve all the patrons is staggering.

Stacie C.,"Fayetteville, NC",28,35,139,4.0,4/2/2016,"Usually not a big chain restaurant goer but I have been wanting to try Cheesecake Factory for some time now. The wait times have always been too long any other time I have tried to visit this restaurant and I have tried in 5 other states. Typical wait times that I have run into are about 2 hours plus if you are trying to hit up dinner service. Today was an exception because we set out for an earlier meal. Waited about 45 min. Did not know if I could expect some Hawaiian influence on the menu seeing as how it is downtown Waikiki and I guess there was a fair amount considering the vast menu but I kinda expected a bit more local variety. Yes, it's a chain but given the location and the demographic there could be a little more thought put into local flavor, especially on the dessert side.  Kid friendly enough and price point was as expected given the location and type of establishment.  Our waitress Danielle was attentive and doing a great job despite being double sat and the level of business that was walking through the door. She answered all of our questions and handled our special requests flawlessly.  The staff seems to work together when it comes to service and food running and pre bussing which is much appreciated and let's things move at a good pace. Food was good.

Kristine C.,"Honolulu, HI",899,443,8388,4.0,2/4/2016,"Not a day goes by that I don't see an overflowing amount of people waiting to get a seat at Hawai's only Cheesecake factory on the island. Call me lucky but, of all the times I've dined in, I've not had to wait for more than 20 minutes. Upon leaving your lovely name on the list with the hostess, you're given your nifty restaurant pager. Cheesecake factory sits on the right side of Kalakaua's busy street (next to Forever 21) on the first floor. You can't miss it.  Wooden furnishings and marble tiles give the vicinity a nice elegant touch with very light metalwork elements. On the right side of the entrance, people form a separate line for takeout and making ordering easy for slices of their famous cheesecakes. That is if you only want to want a pleasuring dessert on the go. The line goes fairly quick.  With an already large restaurant, Cheesecake Factory seems to have a fast turnaround with seating.  An inviting part of the restaurant is the bar with large screens for the sports fanatics. Seats line the bar as well as high top chairs as an option for dining in a more laid back scale. Their clean restrooms are readily available on the right if you break the seal too soon (if you know what I mean). Seats are available in family style and large parties. I very much enjoy their outdoor seating option as it gets freezing cold inside the restaurant. It's also very dim and not enough light on the inside. Why not dine outside and appreciate the alfresco with the fresh smell of the pacific ocean. My dining companion and I wanted to dine outdoors and we were seated after 10 minutes.  A server had stated she will be with us shortly. At this time we still have not received our waters or even any service for that matter. The restaurant wasn't at all busy yet. We were very forgiving and gave her another 5 minutes or so. After she returned repeatedly serving the table behind us it was already 15-20 minutes later. I upsettingly flagged the server on the opposite side asking for waters and for service. He immediately discovered my unruly tone and called for a manager. Slade (the general manager) approached us and immediately apologized for the lack of service and checked on us from time to time. Bobby (our new server) had apologized and served us wonderfully during the duration of our entire dining experience.   After enjoying their nicely toasted white and wheat bread with butter, I enjoyed their Garlic Noodles. This is a nice spaghetti dish with fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, nice whole oven roasted cherry tomatoes with parmesan in a garlic sauce. This is beautifully served with a nice big part of the chicken (can be ordered with shrimp or chicken). I enjoyed this dish with all the vegetables and the chicken as my protein. The chicken is delightfully juicy and not greasy and the little part of the skin was crunchy after the first slice into the meat.   Overall, I very much enjoyed my recent experience here with a slight bump on the side. Their customer service is great with them recognizing the flaw right away. I've also enjoyed many of their cheesecakes in the past. With my cheesecake cravings, this is definitely my go to place. It's that simple.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=240

Lia W.,"Honolulu, HI",14,40,38,1.0,9/7/2017,"It was around 3:52 pm on a Thursday afternoon. I had placed a phone order for three items and was told that it'd take around 15-20 min for pick up. The girl who took my order didn't bother reading back to me my order. And I thought it was strange. Then before I could ask her to do that she hung up on me. I thought they were busy so I gave them 25 minutes and when I showed up at the pick up counter, one item was missing. So the girl who helped me at the counter had told me she didn't take my order as she had just started her shift. I said no problem. How much longer for that one missing item? She said another 10 minutes but I ended up waiting another 20 minutes for it. Then an older guy showed up. He was apologetic and offered to talk to the girl who took my order but he didn't offer to comp a dessert or anything for causing me inconvenience. They weren't even busy at all when I showed up. Total wait time 45 minutes for a phone order. On top of that, their validation on my parking ticket still costed me $6 to park for less than one hour in the Royal Hawaiian shopping center. If their food wasn't just okay, I would not have given them even 1 star for this review. The 1 star is for the food. The customer service here DEFINITELY needs a lot of work for an establishment who has been here for a while. Staff needs lots of training and the manager needs to be more sincere about the oversight by comping the customer WITHOUT HAVING TO BE TOLD TO DO SO. They need to make sure their validation stamp WORKS! The takeaway here is ALWAYS ASK them to repeat your orders back to you BEFORE they hang up on you and ASK THE MANAGER to comp a dessert or something for your time wasted. Because they don't know what they are doing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=240
Princess M.,"Honolulu, HI",120,34,24,3.0,5/29/2017,"The wait is long when you go for dinner and sometimes during lunch.

I always order some sort of pasta and they never seem to fail although I may say it's always too oily for me so (being a rude table guest) I get my plate and drain the oil onto another plate..

The best part is that their buzzers you hold while you wait allows you to walk most of royal hawaiian shopping center! We came here on a friday night around 7:30pm and was quoted an one hour wait time which was exactly on the dot. Staff are always friendly every time I've came here. As soon as we sat down our waiter got us our drinks and was ready to take our orders for appetizers as we were already starving!! We ordered the crispy crab wonton and the spicy ahi fried roll (don't remember the exact name). Our appetizers cane out within 10 minutes nice, fresh, and hot. Very delicous! The crispy crap wontons just melted in your mouth after you bite through the wonton part of course and the spovy ahi fried rolls were not to spicy and tasty which came with a gyoza like dipping sauce. We also shared a Pineapple Paradise alcoholic drink where you literally drink from the pineapple. If you like a sweet, juicy, and not so strong alcoholic beverage this one is a must try. Since we wanted to save room for the cheese cake we shared the steak diane and chicken marsala (not marsala but something similar, sorry forgot the exact name again!) Combo which came with marinated in mushrooms and asparagus, and of course the garlic mash potatos. You can never go wrong ordering this combo. Price not so bad either at $23.90 for this dish. As for the cheesecake, i got the Oreo one and MY GOSH its heaven!!! Not to strong on the chocolate or the oreo, i felt it was a perfect balance not over powering the cheesecake itself.

Dan T.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,14,21,4.0,12/6/2016,"This is probably my favourite place for Cheesecake Factory. Yet, i have to say it was the first place that began my love for the American cuisine. The first time I dine here, I had the best waitress who connected with us and made the best recommendation to make our choice that much easier. Trust me, it gets really overwhelmed with their options. This location is also one that can't be beaten. Right in the heart of Waikiki and near the Sheraton hotel was so easy to get too. I recommend the dark bread with oats , the miso salmon with mashed potatoes instead of the rice which they glazed with sweet honey and the Louisiana chicken. Both were mouth watering and every time I'm back, it's hard for me to order anything else. Hope you enjoy it here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=260

They have such a diverse menu, from american food to italian to thai to even some local dishes like loco moco. I've been going here since I was in high school, so that would mean over a course of 10 years. And, no matter what I ordered, food is always so delicious. Out of the many dishes I've tried, there are a number of them that I don't mind reordering again and again. These dishes include the portobello mushroom burger, pasta da vinci, sweet corn tamale cakes, bang-bang chicken and shrimp, and fried calamari. The tartar sauce and marinara sauce that comes with the fried calamari are by far my favorite compared to other restaurants.  For majority of my visits, we received pretty good service. Prices are reasonable as well. My only but biggest complaint would be the wait time, although I know that there's nothing they really can do about it.

Vince N.,"Maui County, HI",420,1467,5807,3.0,1/5/2015,"Sigh.  Here comes the truth.  After years of eating at TCF, I'm beginning to realize that while they make A LOT of food, and give enormous amounts, it's also not the best tasting, though a few dishes still rock my boat.  ATMOSPHERE: Busy and noisy.  This is the highest-grossing CF in the USA.  Seating capacity is big.  There's 2 outdoor lanais, big bar, and bakery counter.  FOOD: Caesar Salad - The appetizer portion was huge and big enough for two, comfortably for three to share.  Pretty to look at, but the dressing was too tangy for me.  CPK does a better job.  Fried Mac & Cheese - Anything deep fried is awesome right?  Big breaded balls of mac & cheese over a marinara sauce.  This is an app but is huge!  Make sure you can share or devour a lot. Ahi Carpaccio - Super thin ahi with a wasabi pesto drizzle (couldn't taste the wasabi which is awesome to me,) sliced avocado and a togarashi aioli for dipping.  Taste was great but the thin slices results in a plate looking like a fish autopsy after trying to pick out your portion. Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo - This is my ultimate favorite dish here.  I absolutely LOVE gumbo, and I love rice.  It's like a chunky soup, full of flavor with a kick.   Chicken Marsala - The chicken was tender and the mushrooms plentiful, but the sauce is way too sweet for me.  It comes with bow tie pasta.  I once substituted the bow ties for linguine - boy was that a big mistake.  They put nearly 1/2 pound of pasta on the plate with the same minuscule amount of sauce on the normal dish.   Chicken Madeira - This dish is better than the marsala IMO because it has more depth than the overly sweet marsala.  Comes with mashed potatoes.  Pasta Carbonara - The ratio of spaghettini pasta to sauce was 70% pasta, 30% sauce which resulted in a very bland dish.   Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - The linguine was al dente and the chicken and shrimp plentiful, but overall very underwhelming.  CPK does a way better version.  Salisbury Steak - Great flavor with a nice crunchy exterior.  Mashed potatoes were okay but could've used some flavor (or a more generous amount of gravy.)  To my local peeps, it's a hamburger steak but formed into the shape of a steak instead of round patties. Bistro Shrimp Pasta - I had high hopes for this 1,900 calorie dish.  What a disappointment!  The breading of the shrimp had the consistency of breakfast potatoes, and fell off the shrimp in chunks.  The shrimp had no flavor.  Not being not a fan of arugula, I couldn't taste them, thankfully.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and that was the only highlight. Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane Combo - After seeing pics of this, I had to try it.  I thought the scampi came with pasta underneath but didn't.  The 3 shrimp were deep fried and nicely seasoned in a tomato-onion drizzle.  The steak was tender and tasty, in a slightly sweet brown sauce and topped with a few mushrooms.  A wall of mashed potatoes separated the two down the middle.  Highly recommended.  DESSERT: Red Velvet Cheesecake - It looks awesome in the pic, but I didn't care for the taste of cheesecake together with red velvet cake.  I prefer them separate.  Strawberry Shortcake - Not too sweet which is great. Banana Cream Cheesecake - Bananas + cheesecake = OMG. Strawberry Cheesecake - Same as the banana verdict. Original Cheesecake - My boring favorite!  Super light and creamy.  Unbelievable! SERVICE: They do not take reservations.  Be prepared to wait up to 2 hours on weekend nights.  The staff are friendly, even in the most hectic of environments.  We recently had Darren F as a server.  What a super friendly, smiley, and professional guy!  Good deal! TIP: Avoid the crowds by coming for lunch or late night since they're open till midnight.  OVERALL: Generous portions, some subpar selections, weak pasta dishes, but they do have the best cheesecakes around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=280

Hubs and I decided to go eat something yummy, and wound up here. Our wait time for lunch at 1pm on a Saturday was less than 5 minutes. They sat us in the front room, which looks out into the alley facing Nalu storage (surf board racks) and open seating on the lanai. Not bad, but definitely not meant to be a romantic seating space as it is 4 2-tops along a bench. Good thing we weren't there to be romantic! It was entertaining to watch the waitstaff dodge a particular bird who thought he owned the joint. He swooped in a couple of times, and then strutted up and down the aisle until he was shooed completely out the front.  Hubs had the fish and chips lunch and I went with the Cuban and a salad. The wait time for food was a little sluggish, but at least they were on point with my Big Island Ice Tea. We had some calamari, which had the perfect crunch to ring ratio, and that yummy garlic dip--we had to ask for more of that. Waited awhile for the bread which was supposed to be coming straight out of the oven, but it might've had a short delay because it wasn't piping hot, but it was warm. The fish and chips were crunchy and some sort of cod. My Cuban was HUGE! I could only eat half of it. And it was on-point. The yummy pickles added that special crunch.  Our waitress offered the cheesecake dessert specials, but there was no way we were going to finish any more food, so we ordered dessert to go; salted caramel for him, and white chocolate macadamia nut for me. We walked out of there happy campers with dessert for later.

Thankfully, we were brought to a table outside in the front of the restaurant.  Inside, it seemed dark and loud.  So we were very pleased to be seated outside.  Plus, we got to people-watch all the Spam Jammers! Even though the restaurant was BUSY, our waitress was a dream!  Her name is Lily (from Houston) and she was a total gem.  Not only was she super helpful and accommodating, she truly seemed to enjoy her job.  She didn't seem harried or overwhelmed and took her time with us.  Offering to do spilt checks for a large group and even encouraging us to let her know if we needing anything modified.  She said she was the ""Queen of Modifications""!  And she was true to her word. The food came out in good time and Lily was there to check on us right as the food arrived. Me and one of my friends ordered the Rib-Eye steak, and we both ordered it Medium Rare.  Lily asked us both to cut open our steaks to make sure they were cooked properly.  Mine was fine, but my friends looked more Medium than Medium Rare.  Lily took one look and said, ""No way!  I'm taking this right back and making it right.""  I kid you not, my friend had another Rib-Eye sat before her within 3 minutes.  And it was cooked perfectly!  Lily made sure. Then the manager showed up at our table (can't remember his name...started with an S) because he had heard about the steak.  He just wanted to make sure everything turned out ok and we were all enjoying.   Lily took care of us for almost 2 hours.  Every detail, down to recommending cheesecake to each of us according to our liking.   I could go on and on....she was the best! My whole table of 8 women couldn't stop raving about her and the food and the service.  Each of us enjoyed the food immensely.   I was so impressed with the quality of service/food/attention we got...period.  Not to mention the fact that the place stayed packed from the time we got there until we left.

But if you do just want a cheesecake you can go in and on the right side they have a smaller line for those; the cheesecake tastes great, the prices are high but it is occasionally worth it as a splurge. As for the food it is very good but considering the prices and the average 1 hour wait at least, I will not be going here very often at all... really like never basically... The service was okay, everyone was generally polite and nice but we did have to wait a little while for things like water. It seems as though the servers are good but perhaps have too many tables. It stays super busy.  Also they do validate parking I believe we park at the Sheraton and they validate it. Of course that is a decent walk away.

Pearl Joy N.,"Honolulu, HI",209,30,33,3.0,8/21/2016,The wait is pretty long but it's been a while since me and my boyfriend have eaten here so we decided why not give it another try. It took us about an hour wait as we finally got in there was a crowd of people hovering the hostess area waiting to be seated I thought the point of have the buzzer was to avoid the crowed area at the hostess area. When you walk in it is very dark.  We started our meal with 2 appetizers the calamari and the tempura spicy ahi roll. The spicy ahi roll was DELICIOUS.  I would come back and get 2 orders of that.  As for our entree the boyfriend had the steak Diane with shrimp scampi and I had the steak Diane with herb crusted salmon. I don't know much about salmon but when I think salmon I think pink. But it was white and didn't really taste like salmon more of a mahi mahi taste. Idk it might have been just me. But the sauce the salmon was in had a strong lemon sour taste to it while the steak for my plate was tougher then my liking. The mashed potatoes were amazing super creamy and not chalky at all.  Over all experience it was okay probably will not be back for a couple years. The fried spicy ahi roll was the best part of our dinner and will probably be the reason I'll come back. It might have been the food that I ordered that made it and okay experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=300
Lisa A.,"Honolulu, HI",6,39,41,1.0,6/1/2016,"We've been to this restaurant often even though the wait is long and it's in busy Waikiki.  But we've never experienced rudeness the way we did on 5/30/16.  Our waiter, Richard M was getting ready to mention the specials which were fish dishes and stopped himself to tell us they were out of the fish.  He came back to take our order which is our usual Miso Salmon off the regular menu and he repeated himself they were out of fish in an irritated tone.  It wasn't necessary for him to tell us that way because he wasn't clear earlier that ALL FISH, even from regular menu was out. He then brought our drinks and flinged the drink napkin to me.  I starred at him wanting to give him my reaction but I guess he didn't want any of that so avoided me. Then the whole night he was short and abrasive with us.  We were thinking must be a tip pool because he would get his share regardless how he treats his guests. We've never left less than 15% tip ever.  But there's always a first time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=300

We had our drinks and food and dessert to go within an hour. Which was surprising because the restaurant was completely full. We only had to wait 15 minutes for a table which was also surprising. I guess if you are a restaurant in Waikiki you have to be ready for a high volume of people. The food was great, cheesecake was amazing and the service was mind blowing.

Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,5.0,9/7/2015,"My parents and I recently went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner and we encountered the best service yet, in addition to probably our speediest dining experience here ever. Our server--I think his name was Mark--was stellar. Of course, we were there for Sunday for dinner around 5 p.m. and the restaurant was bustling, but he never skipped a beat. He always made sure that our water glasses were full, he packed our bread in a separate to-go container (without us even asking for one), he asked if we wanted our entrees to-go in a timely manner and he was just overall really attentive. He had lots of other parties to wait on, but I was thoroughly impressed by his service.  I also wasn't expecting to get seated so quickly--even though we had a small party--but I think we only had to wait for 5-10 minutes. That was record timing! My parents never deviate too much from our Cheesecake Factory favorites, but everything tasted even better that night because of the great service. Here's what we got: ""Fried Macaroni and Cheese"": This gooey, cheesy mac and cheese mixture gets even better when deep fried and covered with a thin, crispy crumb layer. Cheese simply oozes out of the shell with every bite (truly a must for cheese lovers). The four mac and cheese balls are served with a creamy marinara sauce (not a very strong tomatoey taste) and bits of shredded cheese on top.This dish can be found under the ""Appetizers"" portion of the menu. It's great for sharing if your tablemates love mac and cheese ... or, if you're like me, it's perfect as an entrée because it's just that good.  ""Chicken Madeira"": This chicken dish is famous as the eatery's ""most popular chicken dish."" Flavorful and savory, this one is definitely a winner. The dish contains a couple pieces of tender, sautéed chicken breast topped generously with melted Mozzarella cheese and pieces of asparagus. It's also covered with flavorful mushroom Madeira sauce and is served with fluffy mashed potatoes. Both of my parents usually get this dish; they like it so much that they never want to try anything else! My mom really likes the savory mashed potatoes, and both of my parents enjoy how much cheese and mushrooms top the tender chicken breast.  ""Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple"": This decadent dessert features the original cheesecake in an Oreo Cookie crust and includes caramel, chunks of Butterfingers and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and peanut butter throughout. My dad always orders this cheesecake, and I always benefit because I can bank on having a bite--or two--while ordering my own cheesecake. Although I've tried several of the different ones on the menu, ""Adam's"" still reigns as one of my favorites. In fact, sometimes both dad AND I order the exact same thing for dessert. He always gets his with coffee, though, since it's really, really sweet. I usually eat mine straight up, and my favorite part is the dollop of creamy peanut butter on top. ""OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake"": Though I prefer the original version of this cheesecake (and want it to return), I was glad to try this slight rendition. This cheesecake differs from the original OREO one because it includes a layer of moist fudge cake and OREO cookie mousse atop the cheesecake. It's similar to the original in that it has OREO cookies baked into the creamy layer of cheesecake and is topped with a milk chocolate icing. I had mixed feelings about this cheesecake and preferred the original just because I was not a huge fan of the mousse layer (I don't like mousse in general ... nothing against this cheesecake). But, I really liked the layer of moist, fudgy chocolate cake interspersed with the layer of cheesecake (similar to my favorite ""Reese's Peanut Butter"" cheesecake), and the OREO cookie chunks baked into the cheesecake itself is probably my favorite component of the entire dessert. If the mousse layer were eliminated, I would have no problem with this cheesecake being on the menu instead of the original OREO creation. It took some guts for me to deviate from my usual ""Adam's"" or ""Reese's"" cheesecake, but in the end, I was glad that I tried something different.  ""Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake"": My mom decided to get something different in terms of dessert and opted for this Hershey's cheesecake. It's one that we both always wanted to try, but never took a chance on because we always get the same thing. This chocolaty creation features Hershey's cheesecake between moist chocolate cake and comes topped with creamy chocolate frosting and chocolate chips. A true delight for the pure chocoholic! I think I ended up liking this cheesecake more than my mom, who said it was a bit too chocolaty for her. I liked the fact that the cheesecake and chocolate cake were interspersed, so it actually cut down on the sweetness. My mom thought it would have been more effective if the original cheesecake layer was used in between layers of the chocolate cake, and Hershey's bar chunks were inc",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=300

It's portions are pretty big and there's a lot of dining area to seat a lot of people. Servers and staff are friendly and very nice. They greet you and thank you for coming when you walk pass them. The only thing is that it was my first time seated outside and I didn't think it was sanitary. Yes it looked really nice and neat but as I was eating... The birds kept flying over our heads and constantly popping on the floor. It was the floor so it's not too bad but what if they flew over someone or their entree and pooped over that?

Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",624,1458,1938,2.0,7/24/2014,"Yeahhhh people are crazy to wait in the consistently long lines at Cheesecake Factory. I don't understand why it's so popular. You're literally feet away from one of the world's most famous beaches, yet Cheesecake Factory doesn't even have an ocean view. They offer mediocre American food at high prices. If you want to pay this much for food, you should at least go somewhere with a view. Maybe the kitchen fire a couple years ago made this some kind of weird special attraction. No, that can't be it. Obviously these people don't use yelp to find better restaurants in waikiki (I know, it can be hard).  Ok, I get that their cheesecake is good. That's pretty much where I draw the line though. I wouldn't come back for anything but the cheesecake. And even when I do come back to pick up cheesecake, there's always a line at the counter and the cashiers are rude.  This place will always be busy (unless they try to burn down the building again) because they're so centrally located in waikiki and people passing by just can't help themselves.

Kayla C.,"Lihue, HI",185,9,10,3.0,12/8/2016,"Honestly, The Cheesecake Factory was one of my all time favorite restaurants, but suddenly my experience there was absolutely different from all of the amazing nights I've had.  Although, this restaurant does not take any reservations, we've waited for 2 hours to get a table, which is normal if you wanna eat there. I told myself ""the wait will be worth it"", since they've never failed me. Perhaps, I spoke too soon. Our hostess was very polite and casually spoke to me about her favorite dishes on the menu and recommended me her favorite ""Chicken Madeira""-chicken breast, topped with mushrooms, asparagus, Madeira sauce, mozzarella cheese, side of mash potatoes. A pretty big size! So I figure I try it! They first give you bread and butter to start with, which is always my favorite! Cocktails are always tasty there! Bartenders are really good! Our appetizers were awesome, except we ordered the soup of the day- ""baked potato soup"". At first, our server said that they ran out, they she came back to let us know the kitchen was making a brand new batch so we stuck with the order. Soup came, and it was watery and didn't care for it anymore. It wasn't really a big deal for us, and didn't expect the manager to come by to apologize and offered us a free cheesecake which was really nice of them. My entree came in first, and wondered why the other dish hasn't come in at the same time. Server mentioned that the pasta was given to a different table and making a new one. So the manager came by again to apologize so the delay. As we began to eat, I looked at our food and it looked so good and smelled really good as well! I've eaten a quarter of my meal until I notice a hair on my food. I didn't realize that until I started cutting more of my chicken, and I was pretty upset and, yet, I was pretty hungry. I've told the server about the issue and told the manager. I ended up eating the pasta to share and didn't want to order a new entree. Manager was apologetic again, and I've never experienced this at the restaurant ever, so it really brought me by surprise.  I truly must say, our server was very understandable and she was really nice and apologetic of our experience. I've given this restaurant a 3 star because I feel that although our service was meaningful, the food and the duration wasn't at its best during the time.  Overall experience, parking will be difficult to find, since you need to find a good parking rate and walk to Cheesecake Factory. They do not take reservations, it's a walk-in restaurant that will make you wait 1.5-2hrs. Service by the servers were good, hostess service was good, management team is good. We were just disappointed of the experience after being loyal customers to this restaurant for many years.

Nakita C.,"Honolulu, HI",626,132,182,5.0,11/9/2015,"This has been our family's go to and favorite restaurant for years (we think we started coming in 2004 but maybe 2005)! We used to come about once a month but now with both my brother and I being adults, it's hard to get a family dinner together. We probably come every 3 months and sometimes we're missing a person (usually me) but the missing person gets their order taken home to be enjoyed for second sessions.  We usually come around 3 to avoid waiting for a long time and we like to sit in the 80s because of the beautiful view. We usually sit at table 85.  Coming here is like lunch/dinner and lunch tomorrow! Our usual course of action is bread but we ask for no white and double brown bread, 2 orders of the tempura spicy ahi roll, and the chicken lettuce wraps. A lemon drop for my mom, a Long Island for my brother, and my dad picks something new every few visits-yesterday he got the bourbon and honey which he said was smooth and delicious!  Now let's talk about those apps-if you are a family of 4, you can not order one roll. You will fight over those pieces. It's better for everyone to just order two and let everyone get enough pieces to be happy. After you're done, the brown bread dipped into the sauce is THE BESSSSTTT! The lettuce wraps are my mom's favorite, she sometimes orders them for her entree she enjoys them that much. They come with 3 sauces that are all delicious and I like to put all 3 into my lettuce wrap.  Entrees: My dad almost always orders the jambalaya/gumbo (I've included a picture). I don't remember which title it has because my food is so delicious I don't pay super close attention but he always gets the same thing so it must be awesome.  My mom usually gets fish tacos which I always want a bite of but never do because I'm so full by the time she offers.  My brother and I switch around a lot. He usually gets steak and I used to order chicken. Our favorites are the chicken costoletta, the chicken Madeira, and the chicken Marsala. But seriously if you haven't had chicken costoletta-you should 100% order that.  I gave up being vegetarian yesterday because it was such a tease not eating chicken costoletta so I ordered the herb crusted salmon yesterday which was also delicious and served very similarly to the chicken costoletta. Our family always orders dinner sized entrees because we take home half or more and have it for second sessions around 7:30 or for lunch the next day.  Dessert: Our normal route is to order 1 for the table so we can all have a couple bites and then one each to take home.  The one for the table is usually something new or the seasonal cheesecake. My dad always orders the Godiva, my brother always orders the kahlua and I used to always order the Adams peanut butter fudge ripple but now I take after my mom and try a new one each time. I have to say it's rare we order one we don't like. They're all very good. Yesterday my mom ordered the tiramisu for her take home which is one of my favorites and I got the s'mores cheesecake which was super delish! We saved our leftovers for lunch today and busted out our cheesecakes last night and each only ate half so we're super excited to have leftovers AND half a slice of cheesecake in our lunches today.  So yes, Cheesecake Factory is a chain. However, they provide consistent, delicious food with fantastic customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=320

I ordered a classic burger medium rare with cheddar cheese. The order cano out wrong no cheese, I asked Ellen to have the kitchen make a fresh one.

I asked him to make me a new burger, he said a medium rare burger would take 15 minutes and he suggested I just eat the burger I ordered that was wrong.

Chris L.,"Mililani, HI",66,161,190,5.0,7/14/2015,"There are very few places where you can get there at just after 5pm and already have a 50 minute wait, there are fewer places where I would say ""yes"" to a 50 minute wait and where the reaction to a 50 minute wait is ""Oh, that's not bad."" and there is only one place that I know of on the island where the hostess will tell a party leader that the wait is now 3 hours and they'll still happily accept it. That place is ""The Cheesecake Factory""  The Cheesecake Factory has been a destination for my family for years now, I used to have them take me here on my birthday. Now days though we seldom get the chance to go because of distance and parking and the nighttime craziness that is Waikiki in general, anywho lets break this down into categories again.  Hostess/Front desk  I'm giving this its own category in this review simply because of how much time you are likely to spend here. The wait times I've witnessed have been anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours depending on the time and day. If you really want to try and avoid the wait you need to come in the 3-5pm hours and even then you'll likely be handed a 20-50 minute wait anyway.  The people at the front desk do their best to accommodate everyone but please, please keep in mind that these people get swamped all at once by people who speak a variety of languages, there are only 3 to 5 people at that desk for hundreds of people trying to check in, check out, validate parking ect. They will be sluggish occasionally but yelling at them about it will only make their day worse and the wait longer for everyone else so PLEASE SHOW UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT while you are waiting so everyone can run through as quickly as possible.  If you get to the Cheesecake Factory too late you might be faced with a line, this line will exit the restaurant and nearly hit the street, in my experience at this point your wait will likely be over an hour.  They will occasionally run out of pagers too.  One final thing is that due to how many people there are you can help the line a lot by only sending up one person from your party to wait in line, seriously, like you have no idea how much of a difference that will make with people trying to exit the restaurant with strollers and such.  Interior and Cleanliness I tend to trust restaurants that allow you to see inside their kitchen, they aren't afraid of showing you what they are doing because they know they have nothing to hide.  On the inside you have a very sophisticated feeling space, it's dimly lit with ""marble"" table tops and rich woods, very well maintained especially considering the amount of people through the space in any given hour.  Service The service here is great, we only had one issue where our server very clearly and specifically asked if my father wanted his soup before or with the main courses and my father very clearly and specifically said he wanted it before hand. The server then said he would get it right away and left.  We didn't get it until the main courses came at which point my father sent it back because it was too much food at once, which was a shame, that soup smelled really good.  Food With the amount of food delivered to our table I only tried 3 items personally and I only remember the names of 2 of them.  The Bacon-bacon Burger (Pictured) : Well cooked with a very nice toasted bun, crossed with bacon and served with the lettuce and such on the side so you can choose if you want it or not. It was spot on, solid 5 star dish  The everything Pizza (Not Pictured): The dough on their Pizzas is really flavorful and the fresh ingredients pop. The meats had a smokey flavoring to it that was just amazing, complemented nicely by the cheese.  Crab. . .something. . .crispy Won-tons (Pictured): Yeah, this is the one that I forgot the name for, but these are great. The crab is so creamy and the sauce works well to complete the taste.  All in all due to the experiences we've had over the years I will give The Cheesecake Factory 5 stars despite the issue with the soup, my reason for this is because since we've been coming here that has been the only issue we've had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=320

When we got there, there was not much people waiting in line to get a table like usual. Finding where to book our tables was so confusing. There is people everywhere and lines everywhere so how do you know which one to stand in? I ended up making eye contact with a girl and she helped me. The wait was still one hour...like usual. So we had to come back 40 minutes later for our buzzer thing. We walked around to the Apple Store and forever 21 just to look around while we wait. Then we stood outside...horrible experience. This couple decided to stop and smoke right in front of us. I have asthma...so it was rude!  At 740, we went back and there was a line..so I stood for a little bit because I didn't know where to go...then I saw people going up to the same girl and getting their buzzers. So I went up there. The place is so cramped..people walking everywhere and bumping into you. It was really annoying. I hated how people came in groups just to order cheesecake. Can't you wait outside while your friend or your spouse gets the cheesecake?  Our buzzer buzzed exactly 20 minutes which made an hour wait. So I went over to the girl again and pushed my way through the crowd. Gave her my buzzer and waited again to be seated. Maybe 10 minutes later, we got our seats...it was out in the HUMID air. Ugh...I hate it. The girl was nice, she gave us time to get situated and look at the menu. Got our waters and bread. The bread was cold..I like when it's warm, but oh well. I got the Chicken Di Pana and boyfriend got the Smokehouse BBQ burger. Our food came out together maybe 10 minutes later? Boyfriends burger came undercooked. He wanted medium but got medium rare. My chicken was good. Wish there was more sauce though...and more broccoli!!  Overall the experience was good. Just be prepared for the wait...and the annoying people who don't know where to walk or stand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=320

Caroline N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",49,60,4,5.0,7/30/2016,"We came when it was 50% off cheesecakes on national cheesecake day july 29 and july 30. :)  We got the Paradise in a Pineapple, which was beautifully and creatively presented and also delicious. In it, is Captain Morgan, Sailor Jerry, and Myer's Rum blended with tropical juices served in a whole fresh Hawaiian pineapple. Definitely recommend for $15. Also, took advantage of cheesecake day and got a mango key lime cheesecake. I'm not sure if this was true for all the cheesecakes in Hawaii but the graham cracker crust on our cheesecake was laced with yummy shredded coconut.

My favorite Appetizers are the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Fried Macaroni and Cheese.  For sandwiches my favorite is the Grilled chicken Avocado Club.  For brunch the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich is delicious.   I personally like their breakfast, lunch, and appetizers more than most of their dinners.  When coming here use the menu to your advantage remember this is not an Italian restaurant or steak house this is an American chain restaurant so order accordingly. Obviously it's impossible to go wrong with their cheesecakes whether it's their original or any of their specialty cheesecakes!  Order the Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake or the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake they are both heavenly.

Service on the food is as fast as possible, which can be a little slow sometimes. The decor of the restaurant is consistent with others in the chain, which is dark, cold, but nice. If you want to still feel like you're in Hawaii, sit outside. The tables there overlook busy Kalakaua Avenue, which is a bustling tourist street at any hour. Great for dinner, my favorite meal here is the special Sunday brunch. I love the various eggs benefict dishes, especially the salmon and tomato.

I figured the craving could just be put aside for a calorie bomb cheeseacke.  But HOLD THE PHONE the menu here is so extensive that they actually have several steaks on it! omgomgomg! I decided on the grilled ribeye (rare) because I figured go big or go home. In order to be somewhat health-conscious I switched out french fries for steamed broccoli and was actually really happy that I did. I didn't need the carbs to make me feel full after putting away the entire steak and veggies. (Although I did eat the free bread that came to the table so I did have some carbs...) I dipped my broccoli into my steak juice for extra flavor because it's seriously just steamed (no seasoning even I think) I was so full that I didn't even get any cheesecake. Which made me happy (yay save money & my pants still fit) but sad (aww I love chessecake).

We went on a Saturday night and it was not too much of wait but very busy. Again, it's very busy and very crowded in the lobby so sit outside while you wait and wish for the buzzer to vibrate or sit at the bar.  We actually got seated outside which was kind of nice whereas you can people watch as your view is of the main street. Also it was quieter so you could actually hear each other talk.  Our waitress was very attentive even with all the people there and tables that she was attending to. You could tell that she had been doing this for a while. We placed our drink order and our meal order and the procession of things was very smooth and fluid. There wasn't really a huge amount of down time or awkward sitting and waiting for a waiter to come back out to check on things.  I got a five cheese pasta that was very rich but very good. I decided to save room for some cheesecake because let's be real...why come to Cheesecake Factory and not get some great cheesecakes. There really is a lot of overall selection on the cheesecake menu. There weren't a huge amount of options for vegetarians but they were happy to add or remove items from most of the entrees to accommodate.  It was my sister's birthday so it really was just a nice way to still relax on vacation, have a good solid meal/service and just enjoy each other's company.

Tadder T.,"Waipahu, HI",18,46,1,5.0,7/5/2016,"It's been at least 10 years since I've been here, and like many locals, hardly frequent the place because it takes forever to get in. My last and only memory of this place was that the food was good, not great, and everything else was mediocre.  I was in Waikiki for 4th of July weekend and understandably it was more crowded than normal - 2 hour wait at 9pm at night. No thanks. But I came back the next morning and around 945am it wasn't crowded we got seated quickly.  The hostesses (male and female) left a lot to be desired. Not real friendly or engaging - the bare minimum. The guy leading us to our table just confirmed our name then started walking, no welcome or anything. Luckily we had an awesome server. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and she had a great happy vibe. She made us all feel comfortable. Timely visits to check on us and very accommodating.  The food was excellent as well. Of course everything in Waiks is overpriced but here they give you so much food it's like two meals. The food tasted fresh and was very flavorful - good salads and soup, pizzas, and my steak tacos.  My party all got their food before me and mine took a long time. The manager came out (without prompting) and said the cook overdid my steak and would cook a new dish. She politely asked if I minded waiting, apologized, and offered me a choice of a free side menu item or cheesecake. How awesome is that?! I'll be honest - the normal wait times are too long for me and I may not be back for a while.

Hoku T.,"Honolulu, HI",321,120,395,4.0,6/5/2015,"I love the Lunch Hours! Why, you may be wondering...because I've never waited more than 3 minutes for a table! All the times I've eaten here have only been their opening hours and I like it that way.  On my recent visit the Hostess took us to what I thought was 'the Dungeon'. I don't know why she thought that four women, three of which have poor eye sight, would be fine sitting in a round corner booth with barely any light. Sure some may think that dimming lights make for an 'Intimate Experience'...blah! Not here! It does not look classy to see ladies pulling out their phones to use the flashlight to read the menu! Even after asking the waitress if they could brighten up the lights in the corner or if they had any glasses that had an LED light, she sadly replied that the restaurant can't change the lights and no light reading glasses. For this lack of light set us 10min more into searching into 'The Cheesecake Factory Menu Book' for our Lunch.  Appetizers to try:  Crab & Artichoke Dip! Yes, everyone should try this dip that will not only make you moan because of the taste, but will feed four people very well! We attacked the toasted bread slices, which weren't that much, and the squaw & Italian bread with the crab and artichoke dip! Even after the toasted slices were eaten, we began asking for a second helping of warm bread to place the dip in between and have a nice crab sandwich - which I also recommend trying!  Soup of the Day: when I ordered my Renee's lunch special (chicken and almond salad sandwich with a small baby green salad with blue cheese dressing and a bowl of soup); the soup which was called, ""Spicy Mexican Chicken Soup with cheese and crispy tortilla strips"". This is must try! The closest to this soup in taste is at Chili's - but this clearly out bests Chili's. After one spoonful and I ate the whole bowl of soup before I even touched my salad and sandwich! The soup was very tasty, the Spicy - meaning full of spices because it wasn't hot in rector scale but pipping hot in temperature. This soup can be eaten on a cool Fall evening on a porch staring out into the sunset! Yes, I would definitely go back just for the soup!  Entrees to try that will make you content -  Fish & Chips Factory Meatloaf  Fettuccine Alfredo  Renee's Lunch Special And of course the cheesecake! Though I'll let you decide which is your favorite! Though something I noticed and liked is that they have special cheesecakes for certain holidays.

With all the stuff CCF's offer, it would be nice to see a few more changes. We sat at the bar area so I realize customer service might be lacking compared to the dining room (though it shouldn't), we didn't feel the guy working the bar was the CCF standard of friendly. He seemed bothered by us ordering food and drinks from him.  The woman behind the bar took over after we pointed out our cheeseburger was missing... Cheese! And the fries were cold and limp. She fixed our order asap and was a lot friendlier.  The bathrooms were a mess. They usually are a lot cleaner, so minus some points there. The sink area was covered in water, there was toilet paper scraps all over the floor and wet rags laying on the ground. Yuck.  The white chocolate macadamia Caramel cheesecake was good but it was such a tiny slice for $8. See picture. It really was reduced to a sliver when normally the slices are huge.

Normally I don't do chain restaurants too often but was specifically craving their cheesecake and said hey why not. Lesson learned, will not return. Menu is huge, thus will suit anyone taste buds! (Hoping they will have something that sounds pleasant for you) and you're in Waikiki expect the prices to be high! Ordered the salmon egg rolls as an appetizer, it was delicious! Though I wish it was a somewhat bigger portion, ate the red cabbage it was served with - had a nice crunch and the sesame flavored sauce was refreshing.  I myself had the falafel salad. Overly dressed, so I recommend to order the dressing on the side! I am a believer of not returning food unless it was not specific to my personal order so that was my mistake. The falafel was good! Not too oily and had good flavor for sure. My date had the fish encrusted with macadamia nut or whatever. Being a market priced item, I was disappointed, very small portion and overcooked. The rice and veggies it came with was good though! Cheesecake rules thus any flavor is delicious, salted caramel was on point, wish that was the only thing I ordered.  SERVICE - makes or breaks you as a restaurant but I guess not in this case, it absolutely was not up to par. Was seated but didn't receive water or introduction for 11 minutes. I understand it was busy but an acknowledgement would've been appreciated. Waitress looked exhausted, didn't seem very friendly - more robotic and monotone, turned me off didn't really want to ask questions or for recommendations (that's why I ended up with a salad ha).

I'd pass on the heavy wait at a regular table unless ur with a group-there are always ppl waitin swampin the entrance.  AMBIANCE: Huh?! What did you say?! Yes! It's loud in there. Of course mainly bc of the volume and traffic of people. But who comes to Cheesecake Factory anyway to have a ""quiet candlelight"" dinner. The lighting is pretty dim though. Better have ur phone flashlight handy.  DRINKS: Hubz ordered a Manhattan straight-up (for you hardcore drinkers, u know how tuff it tastes). Waiter was on top of his drinking game and new his liquor well. Was well made with Bourbon, Vermouth and all. Don't forget the cherry! I had some Tropical martini. Came straight up with a cute orchid flower in it-not cough syrup tasting at all. Thumbs up! FOOD: APPS: First off, they serve you warm yummy bread-and that brown loaf with the oats is bomb by itself! Try not to fill up on it even though it is bottomless. 1st up. Can't go wrong with there ""Fried Mac-N-Cheese""! Comes in 4 tennis ball sized pieces, breaded outside toped with sauce, slice down the middle and watch the cheese ooze right out.  Yah better dip that bread all up in der. Mmmm! MAIN: Tried there newest ""Harvest Salad""-recommended by our waiter. Was divine! Refreshing-arugula was not heavy and too crunchy like how romaine lettuce could be. The edamame and pine nuts added texture. And the slices of parm cheese added juss a perfect amt of salt. Even took the rest home! This was a half portion! Hubz ordered the ""Smokehouse Burger""-also recommended by our waiter. Size was not impressive, was cooked as asked, seasoned well, and the BBQ sauce was not too sweet. He enjoyed it! DESSERT: Sad to say, they no longer have one of my favs-""Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake"" so we shot to try another recommendation from our waiter and tried the ""Tuxedo""-and I'm glad we did. It was  chocolate goodness all over! The ganache, fudge, and mascarpone cheese-heaven! Also we ordered a classic, the ""Strawberry"" cheesecake, gotta love that graham cracker crust and large fresh strawberries. Mmm.. WRAP IT UP: Would we be back?! For sure, wouldn't make it a regular spot but CF has always delivered on their food. Always satisfied. One more note-their menus differ a bit fr mainland in that it doesn't have the mini plates/tapas at the front of the menu (addtl 2-3pgs) and a few other items but thats fine bc were in Hawaii and the special is not ""Mahi Mahi"" like it always was back in the mainland lol. Thanks CF for another great dining experience! Keep up the good work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=360

I had the shrimp scampi and steak diane, my boyfriend had the herb crusted salmon and the steak diane, it was delicious.

Matt A.,"Kailua, HI",79,20,58,3.0,8/8/2015,"Seating was quick for a busy Saturday summer. It's 5:30pm on a Saturday. We were told 20 minutes, but got buzzed in 10min. Waiter was friendly, loud and clear when he talked with us. He was very detailed on the menu which I appreciated. Complimentary bread came first. Three mini loaves two whole wheat, one sourdough. Warm and fresh. Nothing spectacular. We ordered the Baked Potato Soup, Potstickers and Kobe Steak Burger. Appetizers and Main dish arrived in a timely manner. The Potstickers were ok. They arrive swimming in the dipping sauce with garnish on top. Potstickers were likely steamed and then seared. The filling inside was generous, but wasn't flavorful. The filling was dry, but the sauce compensated. Baked Potato Soup was standard fare. Generous serving, but nothing that punches out the taste buds). We did need to ask that it be heated up. It came to us on the warm-borderline cold side. Kobe Burger was good. I ordered mine medium rare and my wife got a well done. Both were cooked to order. Burger was moist, but the taste was a little overpowered by the sautéed mushroom and onions. It also came with an aioli side which complimented it well. I'd give the burger a 3 out of 5 (McDonald's is a .5 out of 5 for comparison). Tip: low group numbers probably was the advantage of getting seated sooner than later. It was only me and the wife. Sum it all up. Service was excellent. Food was good. Need to return and try other menu items. I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=360

Misty P.,"Aiea, HI",247,532,448,2.0,4/14/2014,"We came here for lunch due to this place not taking reservations. I've been here before so I know how long the line can get - and well, I have no patience when I'm hungry. The wait for lunch was short, only 10 minutes to get a seat. When seated, our waitress took our drink orders then came back for the appetizer and entree orders. It took a while for our drinks to come out, and later on, the appetizer and entree took a while too. So much so, that I already got full off the free bread. I ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade. It was pretty good and came with a sugar rimmed glass. What I found weird was they gave you no butter knives for the bread. Our waitress was barely to be found so we used a spoon to put butter on the bread. Lame. We ordered kalua pork nachos for our appetizer. This was the best part of the meal. I loved the pico de gallo and guacamole on it. The chips were crispy, had lots of cheese and loved the jalapeno toppings. I ordered the lunch special Pizza with Everything and a salad with ranch dressing. The salad was so-so. Not much taste to the dressing at all. The greens were a spring mix and it was fresh. I just had to add a little salt to the greens for more taste, which I rarely ever do. The pizza was meh. The pepperoni tasted like nasty processed Hormel pepperoni you can get from the grocery store. In fact, I'd rather eat that stuff. The cheese was minimal on the crust and there were small portions of onions, sausage, mushrooms and peppers. The mushrooms on the pizza looked like canned mushrooms. The crust tasted like those microwavable mini pizzas. I ate one slice and boxed the rest to go. I may feed it to my dog, eat it as a desperation lunch or just toss it in the trash. Not sure what decision I'll make yet. Our waitress sucked. Once our order was in, she tended to the other Japanese tourists, and left us without saying a word. She also did something weird, which was stuff her body between our small tables (they are very close in the back side) facing her butt towards our plates and food. Gross. Of course if you come here you got to have the cheesecake. I ordered strawberry cheesecake to go. It was alright. I've had better elsewhere.  Parking was only a dollar if you park in the ""non-hotel guest lot"" at the Sheraton Hotel garage. Don't forget to get your ticket validated, then pay at the prepay machine downstairs or on the 3rd floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=360

Our table buzzer went off right on schd.  We were sat and greeted. However, it was very busy like always so it took sometime for our server to get to us. When he did we placed all of our orders with him. I found that it's just faster to pre-pick what I want ahead of time.  Drinks came out slowly, but they were both delicious. The house bread, sour dough and oat whole wheat, was warm and yummy as always.  We shared the shrimp summer rolls and the hot beef dipping sandwich. Both were very good as well and worth the wait.  We planned to have cheesecake at the end however the blueberry one we wanted was not in season. Which turned out to be a good thing because we were stuffed and going home with leftovers.

Crystal M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,50,42,5.0,4/25/2015,"Here's the thing... No one comes to Hawaii to eat at The Cheesecake Factory. Seems silly, right? But when you have a diversity of food palates and everyone is hungry, and you are tired of trying to please everyone, it makes sense.  We only had a ten minute wait and then we were whisked to a table. Our server knew we were starved and moved at cheetah like speed to take our drink and meal orders.  If you've ever been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know what the food is like but they found a way to make it special. One of our guests had to step out for a call, so our server, Cory, put his plate away to ensure his food stayed warm. When the guest returned, he even brought fresh rice. More on Cory... This guy was a real class act. He gave us the exact amount of attention we needed, was friendly and professional, and had both a sense of urgency and patience.

My boyfriend always drinks his water so fast, but our waiter was always there to refill it, so he never ran out of water. ( That was literally a first because he always runs out of water and has to wait long or ask for more water) idk our waiters name but it was a cute guy & we sat by the bar.

Regine G.,"Honolulu, HI",432,50,14,2.0,3/15/2015,"I don't know why I keep on eating here if I know the service is going to be bad.   Tip: only dine in if you have about 3 hours to spare. That's taking into account the wait time, the time for your food to get out, and time for your bill to come. Today, we waited about 10 minutes to be seated. We spent an hour waiting for our bread and appetizers to come. The wait took so long for our entrees to arrive that we weren't even hungry by the time it came. We had gift cards for cheesecake which forced us to order dessert. Same thing: waited long for dessert that we weren't able to take any more than 2 bites of it .  Now I'm currently writing this review as I'm waiting for the bill to come. It's taking that long!  Food: made the mistake of ordering the luau salad. I regret it. It was overdressed and super oily. I'm pretty sure a pasta would've had less calories than the salad I ordered. I should stick to my usual -- the Thai lettuce wraps.  I hope Cheesecake Factory decides to build another location that's not in Waikiki.

Quoc-Nam N.,"Honolulu, HI",21,78,102,5.0,4/26/2016,"We came during lunchtime and it was already packed. So, we saw an opening in the bar area & took that risk! for those of you who are frequent ""dining outers,"" you all know that service in the bar area is hit or miss. In this case, the service was spot on! We have only have one person to thank for that and it was Blaine! Although the bar area was packed, Blaine was very considerate and attentive, not only to our table, but to all of his tables. He was super kind and friendly as well! Just his service alone made our experience a positive one.  But of course, I need to review the food. Let's just say it's Cheesecake Factory! I mean everything is good here! I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps (Create your own Thai lettuce rolls! Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles & Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili & Tamarind-Cashew). How does that sound?! Exactly!!! This appetizer is really big enough to serve 2 people, but I was pretty hungry. All the flavors blended so well together and each of the sauces gave each roll a unique taste profile! They were not spicy at all. Even better, there was the perfect amount of chicken for each piece of lettuce! Where does that ever happen? It happens at Cheesecake Factory! My wife ordered the Kale & Quinoa Salad (lots of tender kale, quinoa, grapes, sweet red pepper, sunflower seeds & parmesan cheese. Tossed with our Lemon Vinaigrette). Umm...just order it if you are looking at a ""healthy"" salad. This salad has so much flavor that you will not be able to put down your fork! The bitterness of the kale is balanced out with the sweetness of the grapes and the tanginess of the vinaigrette! And, its super healthy! There is a generous portion on this order, so you could definitely share, or save some for later! Bottom line: if you can stand the wait, come here to eat! Just like other Cheesecake Factory locations, the food will not disappoint! And, it is located on the main strip (Kalakaua Ave) in Waikiki with a nice sized lanai to eat on! Hope you enjoyed it as much as we did!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=380
Elizabeth D.,"Honolulu, HI",210,187,5010,2.0,2/26/2015,"Located by Royal Hawaiian shopping center in Waikiki. You already know because of the location, this place is supah packed! Tourists pack this place as well as locals.  If you don't mind waiting for 1 hour and a half and have patience  like a saint then do come and join the chaos. The decor is like an old nostalgic museum and oh soooo dark. We had to look at our menu with our cell phone.  Staff is nice as can be, given their working condition.  Atmosphere is oh so hectic and crazy. Not at all relaxing. Not at all surprised, it's Waikiki.  After waiting for soooo long for a table, we finally got buzzed and was so famished, we couldn't wait to eat. Our tables was near vents and it was soooo cold, brrrrr. It was so cold it was miserable. Dare not to ask for another table because didn't want to wait another 2 hours.  We were served bread that was soo hard and stale but ate it anyway because we were so hungry. We did let the server know it was hard and stale and she did bring us out another set of bread. The second one was very soft and not at all stale, but we were already full from the first set of bread.  Soup of the day was potato soup and boy it was good. I don't know if it was we were famished or not but it looked and tasted very good. 5 stars.  Shrimp thai rolls was very tasy and good, there was 2 sauces, peanut and a sweeter sauce and they both complimented shrimp roll very well.  Teriyaki steak was a bit to sweet, not your authentic teriyaki, it was just ok. It was so busy I didn't realize they forgot the asparagus tempura that comes wiith the teriyaki dish. It was chaos and I just wanted to get out of there.  Combination steak diane and salmon was average and nothing out of the ordinary.  Combination steak diane and shrimp was tasy and generic.  Salad was just ok.  The best part was the chocolate cheescake. 5 stars.  The wait here was crazy insane but what to expect in Waikiki.

Shae B.,"Kailua, HI",0,32,12,3.0,3/12/2017,"I called the restaurant in the morning to ask if they take dinner reservations for large parties (it's normally walk in only but I figured since we had 20 people, I figured the could accommodate us with a reservation) and the women said no. I asked how long the wait would be for a party that large and she said, ""anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours, we don't take reservations."" So I was a little irritated and told her that I thought it was ridiculous for a restaurant to not want to accommodate a large party like that and then said thank you, to only hear the phone slam down and see my call ended. Not sure who I spoke to, couldn't get a name because she hung up on me. Later that evening, one person from our party went down early and put our name down at 5:30pm which ended up only being 10 of us because the rest of the party could not make it. They told him that the wait would be 90 minutes to 2 hours. Our entire party was staying at the Hilton so we decided we'd catch a cab to the restaurant by 6:30pm and would only have to wait 30 minutes, and hour at the most because of the estimated wait time. At 6:30pm, we got a call that our table was ready. We hopped in a cab and headed down there, only to be stuck in traffic. The person in our party said they would only hold it for 10-15 minutes, after that, they were giving our table away. We knew we weren't going to make it in time so we called and asked to speak to a manager. The manager said that they gave the table away but when we get there, we'll be the first to be seated with the next table opening. We waited for about 45 minutes until we were called to be seated. The host told us, ""I know it says you don't want your party to be split but my manager Stephanie wrote void on here and we have you in separate booths behind each other."" Because we were tired of waiting and hungry we just said whatever yeah we'll take it. When we were seated, the booths were split 4 and 6 and we did not like the seating at all. My Mom asked to speak to a manager. Jen (manager) walked over and said she was going to try and get us a table all together. The waitress Bianca, not really aware of what was going on was sassy and had an attitude. When she found out we were moving, she said, ""well I'm not gonna put in your order until I know if you're moving or what's gonna happen."" After 10 minutes, we were moved to a table that could accommodate us all. Our new waiter, Ken, was very friendly. He checked on us frequently and made sure we were all good on waters, bread, etc. Jen, the manager from earlier, came and also checked on us. Jen and Ken definitely turned our bad experience and night into a better one. Three stars for the shitty service we received earlier in the night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=380

The meal was the Cobb Salad (lunch size), for my wife and I opted for the Fried Calamari (appetizer).  We also had an Iced Black Tea and a Beer (on tap).  The drinks came cold and frothy.  The ambience was satisfactory; though not of their fault.  There are just too many people walking and driving past the dining area that it becomes not a nice view, rather, a bother.   When the meal arrived we were overwhelmed with the size of the portions.  The ""lunch size"" Cobb Salad was enormous and the Calamari was large enough for four people!!  It was delicious and prepared in both taste and presentation to an appealing fashion.  We were very happy with the experience and it only got better... When it came time to order the famous Cheese Cake, we opted for the Vinilla Bean Cheese Cake and I will order the Low Carb Cheese Cake tomorrow (there are a few options available within this catagory).  The CC we ordered was for takeaway and came ready to go.  While we were waiting for the CC, I ordered the Espresso and it was, actually, better than that which can be found at Starbucks.   When it was time to leave, we received our bill and wasn't taken aback by the charges.  All included, it came to $43 and with tip, $53 out-the-door.  You can't beat that for a Waikiki Beach & famous restaurant for lunch.  They earned 5-Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=380

The food was served at perfect intervals, our drinks were always full and we are leaving so stuffed that we are waddling!

Grace L.,"Honolulu, HI",222,319,387,4.0,1/27/2014,"The cheesecake factor always has its good and bad days, simply because it caters to such a large crowd of people. First off, it's located in Waikiki, which means you will most likely be waiting 2 hours at dinner time.  It's such a pain but sometimes it's the only place that works for everyone because they serve such a wide variety of foods- soups, salads, sandwiches, pasta, pizza, seafood, steak, etc.  The list goes on and on. My favorite dish is probably the Luau Salad.  It's really fresh and filling, and I'm a huge fan of the crunchy wonton that comes with it.  I also loooove their baked potato soup (but their soups change daily).  I could eat a bowl of soup and bread and be completely satisfied.  THEY MAKE IT FROM SCRATCH! I asked.. Their sweet potato fries are good as a side.  And I also like their herb salmon, which comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Their kalua pig pizza and four cheese pasta is good too but both are heavy heavy dishes so be wary! You guys all know about the cheesecake so I don't have to convince you on that.  I personally just like the strawberry one or the blueberry one, but I'm a simple cheesecake girl like that. Service is usually pretty good and so is the food.  But it's crazy busy all the time so I think sometimes that can affect the service and the food.  It's good if you want somewhere that is decently nice but not too expensive.  The only annoyance I have is that it's always too busy and you have to park in the royal hawaiian.  They validate for sure but it's only two hours and you're usually waiting for 2 hours just to get into the restaurant.  You'll have to pay for parking beyond 2 hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=380

My spouse has to eat lots of protein after the surgery so we thought the Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken from The Cheesecake Factory would be nice. The restaurant is about 20 minutes walking distance from our home so I went. When I arrived and placed my order, my card didn't go through and the employee who rigned up my card said he has never seen this kind of error before. So he called the manager. She also tried and then asked if I have another card. I said I don't and that I don't have problems with this card. I asked if she can ring it up on another machine and all she said was sorry, the other machine is the same. She didn't even try or listen when I said this card works and there is no issue.

Carmen K.,"Honolulu, HI",202,13,3,3.0,8/28/2016,"I've been to plenty of cheesecake factories in my life, specially living on the mainland so I'm not new to their menu/service. The Lines were relatively short (15-20mins tops) for such a busy place, and they just have one bench to wait inside, but there is lots of space outside where you can sit and comfortably wait!  The service was ok, our server was Muhammad S., he forgot to give us our drinks (which were water) before our appetizers came through, but the lady that dropped our food was kind enough to get them for us right away, so that was nice! I think it was the manager that stopped by shortly after to apologize, it really wasn't a big deal though, Muhammad refilled our drinks often enough from then on and was relatively aware so YAY!  The food was AMAZING as always, makes it all worth it so kudos to the cooks, they're the real MVPs! It did take FOREVER for it to come, but it only makes sense with such a big busy restaurant.  As for the seats, this definitely isn't a place you go with a date, so make sure that you request a more private booth or something, you're better off finding more privacy sitting at the bar! The seats for 2 are actually a booth on one side and a chair on the other and these are in a row with maybe 2ft in between each set. I could literally hear CLEARLY every conversation from the couple next to me on both sides and the ones next to them and next to them. I did see some more 'private' seats but they were for 3ppl or more, and with the restaurant always so busy, they try to use those for that many people ONLY.

Okay so I have been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times before and we had excellent service and everything I tried before was very good but this last time we went we had HORRIBLE customer service. Our waitress we had didn't seem in the best mood and wasn't the friendliest(which of course I understand we all have our bad days and that place gets crazy busy). Anyways we ordered our food and I order a pasta dish I've never tried before it was the Four Cheese Pasta(it normally comes with marinara but I asked for Alfredo sauce instead and it didn't seem to be a problem). I got my order and just decided I really did not like it so I asked our waitress if I would be able to switch it out for something different that I've had before and I knew I for sure liked(and no I don't normally do this at restaurants) and she said yeah sure no problem. Well then about 5 minutes later I see this guy(pretty sure he was a manager, I'm not sure though) come out with my same pasta dish that I asked if I could switch out and he says ""so you made us do a special order for you, this item on our menu is a special request item(which I didn't know I guess I didn't read the fine print closely enough), and now you don't want?"" I said well I don't really like it to much I'm sorry I can just keep it, it's fine. He said ""alright I'll just box it up for you then"". He left the table and our waitress comes by a couple seconds later and I asked for her to just cancel my other order then because I don't really want to pay for two dishes and she said alrighty no problem. Then about 10 minutes later the guy walks up to our table with our bill, my to go box, and the other dish in a box that I asked her to please cancel it and he said ""well here's your quesadilla, do you still want it or do you just want me to throw it away?"" And I told him that I told our waitress to cancel it and he said ""well we made it so what do you want me to do with it?"" I said well I don't want to pay for two dishes sir I'm sorry I don't know what else to tell you. He said ""alright I'll just got throw it away"" and then gave us our bill and left the table. I was so angry with the tone he was using with us, the way he handle the whole situation...I was just shaking so bad because I did not know what to say to him or how to even handle the whole situation. Any other restaurants I've ever been to and end up not liking a dish they either offer to switch it out or take the dish off the bill entirely and are very nice and respectful about it.

Hanson D.,"Vancouver, Canada",124,255,4,3.0,3/13/2016,"Nosh and Nibble came here for a late dinner and I had a great taste of the following: French Country Salad ($10) Parmesan-Herb Crusted Chicken ($16.50) Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo ($18) Before any of this started though, we were greeted with a (freely refillable) basket of bread. I'm usually not a big fan of filling up on carbs but there was a good variety to choose from here. Each ready-to-split piece was quite chewy and moist. Easy on the butter if you can help it though since generally there is a lot to come. The French Country Salad came with mixed greens, grilled asparagus, beets, goat cheese, candied pecans, and vinaigrette. The acidity from the vinaigrette is what made all the other ingredients stand out. Each bite was quite tasty but I wish there were a few more beets to be found since they were claimed to be so fresh. The Parmesan-Herb Crusted Chicken was a plate of sautéed chicken breasts coated with parmesan-garlic. On the outside these looked like cute hamburger patties but they were actually made of kitchen. The sauce had unfortunately sploshed around on my plate by the time it arrived which soiled the presentation a bit. Taste-wise, the bread crumbs added a nice texture but the chicken was a bit dry in some places. There was enough sauce to compensate, but I don't think this sauce compensation should be a long-term solution. My favourite plate of the evening was the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. This was a mixed plate of shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic simmered in a spicy cajun style broth with cream and topped with steamed white rice. This was a very exciting dish as it came, though I feel the herb bits scattered around the white rim of the plate should have been kept to the middle ring. This tasted great though! The meats were all cooked very well and while the other two dishes were a bit of a miss for me, this gumbo was good enough to salvage any meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=420

Richard N.,"Honolulu, HI",6,6,6,5.0,10/6/2014,"First time at the Cheesecake factory and wow was it busy. They don't make any reservations so it's all walk ins. I mean the wait time was an hour and a half to 2 hours long! They said the best time to come was either before 5:30 pm or after 9:30 pm. I came in around 9:30 pm and they said it was only 20 minutes. That was fine considering there were many stores around that I could check out while I waited.  The atmosphere...set the mood the the restaurant. The music was a little loud when you first walk in, so you couldn't really hear the hostesses. But getting to your table the music kind of died down a little. The lighting of the restaurant was dimmed all around with the tables having their own lights shown on then.  The menu...was crazy! 21 pages of over 200 different varieties of items to choose from! I really don't know how the server would remember all of that. But apparently she told me that they have an excellent training program.  The food...was pretty good but not what I expected. I ordered the filet mignon, which is one of my favorite steaks. Normally the filet is suppose to be a lean cut of steak with no fat to it, just all meat. But the one here is the first ever filet that I've found some fat in. I mean it was good, but it could've been better without the fat.  For desert, I was suggested either the banana cream cheesecake or the key lime cheesecake. I ordered the banana cream and it was amazing! I'd say that one cheesecake is enough for one to two people. So if you order, try and get different types and share! They are known for their cheesecakes after all.  The value...of my food could've been better. Typically the price of a filet is around $29.95 - $32.95. I dint think that it was with it for the filet, however, the Cheesecake was amazing! And the value of my service was excellent! My server was Olivia and she really knew her stuff. She was very attentive and made sure all her tables got what they needed. She answered many of the questions that I had about the menu and that really impressed me since there are a lot of options on there. And congratulations to her! She is due to give birth in 6 weeks!  As I was leaving the restaurant I spoke with one of the managers named Bryan and told him about my experience. He was also very knowledgeable about the restaurant. He gave me some good tips about how to be successful in opening up your own restaurant.  Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant. But if you do decide to go, go in either before 5:30 pm or after 9:30 pm. If you need to go on between this time, it's fine, since you can go shopping or walking around waikiki to kill some time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=420

Syvannah O.,"Chinatown, Honolulu, HI",378,94,305,2.0,11/2/2015,The wait is ridiculous! We waited nearly 3 hours just to be seated and over an hour for order. We arrived at 6:30 and didn't eat till after 10. A lot of our orders were wrong. It's really not worth the hype! I use to love coming to the Cheesecake Factory but their service has definitely slower. It's probably better to go during lunch when it's slower. Don't go during dinner unless you've already ate b/c by the time you get your meal you'll be starving,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=420
Brigitte S.,"Honolulu, HI",603,368,5709,4.0,11/24/2014,"I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in years but we recently found an old gift card & decided to out it to good use. We chose to go for Saturday lunch right at noon in hopes of beating the rush.... we luckily did and got a lovely booth in the back where it was quiet and we had a view out an open window. I decided since it was the weekend (and almost time for vacation) to treat myself to a couple bloody Mary's. They were actually very good; super spicy & just enough booze kick. Zing, good morning! ;) My boyfriend and I both went with lunch specials. I think people need to remember what great desks they are - good prices & lunch size portions and combos from the regular menu. My man went with Renees Special - salad, 1/2 chicken-almond salad sandwich (or fresh turkey) and a bowl of soup of the the day, which happened to be baked potato. I went with the pizza & salad combo, the Portofino pizza sounded right up my alley at that moment. You can pay $1 to upgrade your salad to ceasar PS. My pizza had basil almond pesto, grilled chicken, calabrian peppers & three different cheeses. Fresh & toasty delicious! My garden salad had a really beautiful light dressing & lots of tomato. Boyfriends caesar was classic; the almond-chicken salad sandwich was way bigger than expected & on buttered toast that was mouthwatering by itself. The baked potato soup was extremely creamy & tasty with lots of chunky potato and crumbed bacon. You knew it had to be high calorie but you couldn't stop licking the spoon. We were both very satisfied and at a good price. We had to finish off the meal with cheesecake of course so we went with chocolate chip cookie dough. NOMNOMNOM!! We had great service and our waitress was friendly. She was obviously well trained. This wasn't a five star dining experience but we had a lovely tasty meal in Waikiki without feeling totally like a tourist without breaking the bank. I remembered why I used to love coming here :) As we were leaving we saw a crowd coming so timing is important but definitely a good meal. Also...Lunch specials are served til 5pm FTW.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=420

I asked Jess to recommend some things to me and I am blown away with how great her recommendations were. The chicken Katsu with a spicy miso sauce- MUST TRY! Now i know what hawaii people are thinking- chicken Katsu? Really?- but DANG! That was the best ever. Very juicy crisp slices over a bed of rice topped lightly with delicious sweet and spicy miso sauce with sautéed veggies on the side- win.

And there's only 2 choices - a nearby hotel or a restaurant. Cheesecake Factory is the absolute BEST place.

We came here on our last day in Hawaii for Lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We were told it was a 10-15 minute wait and were handed a pager. Within in 10 minutes our buzzer went off - quickest wait time I've ever experienced. The hostess led us to the back of the restaurant, there was some confusion with finding out table and we were left stranded for a minute.... She then returned and led us to a two seater table along a banquet. Our waiter promptly came over and took our orders. I was mainly here for the cheesecake however I did order a little something to pass the time until dessert. I love the complimentary soft and warm bread they serve here. The dark rye is my favourite. For Main I ordered the: Asian Chicken Salad w/ Grilled Chicken, Romaine, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Green Onions, Cilantro, Rice Noodles, Wontons, Almonds and Sesame Seeds Served with Sesame-Soy Dressing The description of this salad sounded soo enticing and I love a crunchy salad however after a couple of bites I found it too be quite boring and lacking something in the flavor department. My husband ordered Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger w/ Smoked Bacon and Melted Cheddar with Crispy Onion Rings and B.B.Q. Ranch Sauce He loved his burger, it was pretty juicy cooked perfectly medium rare and a hefty burger too! Finally dessert - my main reason for coming here  Reese's® Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - Chunks of Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups in our Original Cheesecake with Layers of Delicious Fudge Cake and Caramel As a chocolate peanut butter lover this was heavenly to me! Sooo rich and delicious I was happy I hated my main as I was able to devour every last sinfully scrumptious bite! Overall the Cheesecake factory is what it is.

BTW, not sure if other yelpers have experienced this, but I couldn't find this business on yelp after searching for ""Cheesecake Factory"" or ""Cheesecake Factory restaurant"". However, after typing ""THE cheese..."" It popped up. Definitive articles matter! The first time I came here, service was awesome for a busy place. We were quickly seated, attended to, ate, paid, left. Quick experience but no complaints there, being the food filled our bellies and our waitress was nothing but sweet and bubbly. Second time, however, was bit unsatisfactory. There was a wait, which I didn't mind. We held onto their alarm vibrating pager, which looked suitable to shave Dumbledore's beard. We asked for water that we were not provided, and it came, long minutes after several intense sessions of eye-rolling and sighing, compliments of our waiter who I felt tended to rush us to order.  We ordered, and our food finally came. I didn't recall ordering an Everything Pizza with half burnt pepperonis, but I guess that was just the special that night :/ The rest of the food was yummy, especially the cheesecake, which was really the reason why I came in the first place.  Their cheesecake is to die for, but for food and customer service.. :/ maybe on a less busier day.

Always a great ambiance with perfectly dim lighting and beautiful details in the restaurant, and this particular location is very well done. They even have some local flair on their menu.

Christine E.,"Honolulu, HI",80,222,1523,4.0,12/12/2012,"Whyyyyy, why don't you make another Cheesecake Factory somewhere else on the island? Dont get me wrong, I love the fact that my 2 hour wait for the Cheesecake Factory gives me a good excuse to shop - ""well, we have to kill 2 hours anyway, i might as well go to the new 2 story Victoria's Secret store. you know, just to look...:)""  but I really wish I could skip the wait and go straight to the overindulgence.  There are many things I love about the Cheesecake Factory:  1) The brown bread. It's sweet, and when you put butter all over it, it's delicioussss. Skip the sour dough though. 2) The cocktails. Give me a frosty Georgia Peach - peachy slushy awesomeness swirled with raspberry - and i'm in heaven!  3) The food. OMG they give SOOOOOOOOOOO much! and it's GOOOOD. I know there's a thousand things on the menu, but I hardly deviate. It's either I want pasta - in which case I get the Farfalle with Chicken and Sundried tomatoes (creamy and delicious), or I want Food-Food - in which case I get the Chicken Madeira (Mashed potatoess!!!), or I want a sandwich - in whch case you gotta go for the Avocado Chicken club craziness which taste like a club sandwich but on grilled cheese.  4) The cheesecake. Red velvet cheesecake. That's it. The end. Stick a fork in me. Delicious. I'm also a very huge fan of the carrot cake cheesecake, and the peanut butter one.  If you are someone who doesn't mind the wait because you intend to use the ""wait"" as an excuse to shop to your drop, then go for it. Cheesecake factory is one of those chain restaurants I actually like! Side note: if you're ever in Vegas and eat at the Grand Lux in the Palazzo or Venetian?

Taryn L.,"Honolulu, HI",161,221,1283,4.0,6/12/2013,"This is one of my favorite restaurants on the island.  My love for the Cheesecake Factory shows every time I brave the Waikiki crowds and the hour wait for a table just to get one of their pasta dishes.  While this restaurant is known for their namesake (and their cheesecake is good), I ALWAYS come back for the Pasta da Vinci. It's penne pasta in a delicious (and addicting) wine sauce with chicken, mushrooms and onions. The waiter normally will freshly grate/shred cheese on top of the pasta. There is just something about that pasta sauce that calls to me; it's slightly sweet and not too rich.  I've never found any entree like it.  When you're at the Cheesecake Factory, you always have to save room for dessert. They have a multitude of flavors of cheesecake, plus other types if desserts too. I usually get the vanilla bean cheesecake - it's surprisingly light for a cheesecake. The flavor isn't overpowering or overly sweet. I've also had their lemon raspberry cream, peppermint (seasonal), white chocolate raspberry truffle, and the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake slices. No matter which ones I've tried, the vanilla bean still takes the number one spot for me (okay...that peppermint cheesecake for the holiday season is a close second - if only they had it year-round!). Also, keep in mind, that with all cheesecake slices, they give these huge dollops of whipped cream. Just delicious! (I try not to think of calories when I eat here) The food and the cheesecakes are amazing here and their bread is just as fantastic.  At other restaurants, I normally don't eat the bread so I have room for appetizers, the entree, and dessert, but here, I skip apps and I eat the bread. If I didn't love that pasta so much, I'd consider eating just the bread for my meal. It's that good. Plus, it is complimentary.  Tips: - When you come here, expect at least a 45 minute wait to be seated - get your parking validated - always save room for dessert :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=480

We didn't have to wait too terribly long for our appetizer or main course. She did come back once for a refill and I asked for more bread. The next time we saw her, we asked for boxes, some cheesecake to go, and the check.

My wife and I always go to restaurants starving and yes, eat as much as we can before we waddle out.

How we were able to get a table for 2 on a Sunday afternoon right away is beyond me as every other time we walked by the restaurant there was a sea of people waiting to be seated. The next part of this review might explain why there's such a long wait. I don't know about all the staff, but our waitress seemed to really embrace the laid back, take it easy nature of the island lifestyle. Service was very slow. There's a fine line between pestering the customer and not being attentive enough, but ours just vanished for a long period of time. It was hot, so when we sat down, we were happy when she said she'd be right back with bread & water. She came back, with nothing, and took our dink orders. She then finally came back after another wait with our drinks and bread (still no water). We then had to wait around for an unusually long time for our order, and then again for the bill. My wife would, without a doubt, say Cheesecake Factory is her favorite restaurant so we've been to many many locations. We've never experienced such laid back, non attentive service before. It wasn't enough to upset us, but the whole time we were there, we kept commenting on how off the whole experience felt. It was like we were in a Cheesecake Factory that just wasn't a Cheesecake Factory. We would look around and watch them forget to buss tables before others were seated & other customers looking around for their waiters. Just not what we've come to expect from Cheesecake. It really bummed her out. Oh, and decided that I'd try the Hawaiian fish sandwich as I wanted to try something I couldn't get at another location. It was okay.

Emi H.,"Honolulu, HI",5000,1564,14110,3.0,4/28/2012,"The #1 rule of good management: Feed your people! My team and I were setting up for our Yelp booth at Spam Jam and I decided to pop over to Cheesecake Factory to grab take-out for the looooooong event ahead.  I tried to order my favorite thai chicken pasta but the woman at the counter informed me that it had been discontinued. I shook my fist in the air and screamed ""Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"" After my fit and several rounds of crying, I proceeded to order the tomato basil penne pasta and a french country salad which consisted of greens, asparagus, beets and goat cheese. I ran back to my booth and returned twenty minutes later for my order. Back at the Yelp booth the three of us (me, Thomas O & Pua P) dove into the two dishes. The portions in classic Cheesecake Factory style were gigantic! The pasta was nothing too adventurous but satisfying. The french country salad exceeded my expectations and was very tasty! It's something I'd certainly order again on a return visit. $25 fed all three of us so it wasn't too shabby of a deal! The service at the bakery counter was alright but I thought it lacked overall attentiveness. They seemed really busy checking on their registers and cheesecakes, but wouldn't it have been better to tend to the customer first? I waited for someone to help me both times while ordering and upon my return to pick up my food. The phone kept ringing again and again while I was there and all I could keep thinking was ""That's your customer on the phone. Will someone pick it up?!"" I know I'd want someone to answer my phone call if I was calling. I've decided to pull back a star because well...I want my damn thai pasta! Bring it back! Bring it back! Bring it back!

First they don't have the ""skinnylicious"" menu in Hawaii so don't come here if you like to watch unnecessary calories. (And I know in their regular menu they make dishes with unnecessary calories) Second I ordered the herb lemon roasted chicken and 10 minutes later the manager comes to tell me that they can't serve me that because the chicken wasn't cooked or something. She hands me a menu to order something new and my waiter had no idea and was baffled when I went to order the Parmesan- crusted chicken.  Third- my husband wants to order a torte and I asked for a side of raspberries since I love fresh fruit with whipped cream. They don't have rasberries! And the strawberries that came on it were not fresh.   I will continue to support you in the mainland states but for the 6 years I live here, I will not visit this Cheesecake again.

Parking is in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center lot.  DON'T park in the hotel lot... they will not validate.   Bottom line: Opt for another location for food and just order a cheesecake to go from the little take out counter in the front.  Even with that, you will wait in a pretty long line and will be swished into the front area (where loads of people will be waiting for seats).  But at least the wait will be relatively short.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=540

We ordered to appetizers the guacamole that we said spicy which had zero spice or flavor we had to add salt the chips were cold and oily. The tomato mozzarella toast was ok but super sweet like they added sugar to it which was strange. I also ordered a mixed drink that tasted like diabetes in a glass. I took one sip and told the waitress to take it away. Again asked for more water which of course never came. The second time around that the food came out my steak Diane was so blue it had a pulse and was cold and my husbands was cold also. Strange yet bad experience.

Obviously the waiting line was a mile long so we walked into the bar. When we noticed several empty tables we asked one of the employees if we could take one. We were told it was open seating in the bar and we could even order food in the bar so we sat down. A waiter came and took our drink order and then we told him we wished to order food. At that time we were told we had to leave the table because a hostess had not seated us. We explained what another employee had told us but he insisted that we must leave the table immediately or we would be removed. Are you kidding me! We are in our 60's and we were embarrassed and humiliated by this treatment. I will never step foot in a Cheesecake Factory again.

Got the Hawaiian pizza (was too overwhelmed with the menu so I got something familiar) and I didn't care for it. It was really floppy and soft. Not crisp like a pizza should be. I didn't really like the flavour and there was maybe ONE pineapple piece on each slice. Sometimes two if I was lucky.  The waitress knew I didn't like it and at least took it off my receipt so I appreciated that a lot.  Got a salted caramel cheesecake slice to share which was very good.

It always makes your visit 100 times better when you can laugh & joke around with your waitress. I came with 10 other people & she didn't miss anything. She was fast to refill drinks, fast with the appetizers, entrees, dessert, checks, everything! I will definitely be back in the hopes of being served by Jess P.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=520
Nikidrea E.,"Wahiawā, HI",4,35,36,5.0,9/26/2015,The food is probably the best on the island of you want to have comparable food to what you would have on the mainland. Many restaurants in Hawaii lack flavor or some component that makes it exciting because they cater to the customs of East Asian cuisine because they make up a huge portion of tourism here. I've had a lot of things that weren't good or bad. The food here made me want more with each bite. I like big flavor in my food. My palette craves that kind of stimulation. This place is great on flavor. Customer service is good also.its a bit noisy but the location along the strip couldn't be quiet.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=520
Lisa B.,"Niddrie, Australia",4,13,,3.0,12/29/2016,"Our youngest wanted to try this place so reluctantly we agreed to get a buzzer and wait 20 minutes for a table, which isn't too bad given how long you can wait for.

The food servings are ginormous and even the drinks! It's certainly is great value for money. If you don't finish your food you can take it away. The menu is HUGE. There certainly is something for everyone on the menu. We have been twice in the week we were in Waikiki. The first time we had grilled fish tacos and Evelyn's Favourite Rigatoni pasta & a slice of the fresh strawberry cheesecake. Both mains were great & the cheesecake was nice - though I'm not much of a cheesecake person but I had to try it while I was there. After seeing the next table order burgers we were excited to come back and try the burgers for ourselves. The second time we had the Americana burger with sweet potato fries and the Traditional burger with fries. Wow! The burgers there are fantastic! The meat patty is thick and juicy and cooked to your own liking. The sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had. All meals were fresh and the service is quick. Best to go during lunch or before the dinner rush as there is ALWAYS a 30-45 minute lineup for dinner time.

Doris B.,"Honolulu, HI",5,37,29,3.0,8/9/2015,"3.5 to be exact. Kamaainas but first time at the Cheesecake Factory. Pass this place many times & the long lines scared this local girl away. but hubby wanted to try it so we got into the long line & reached the check in counter at 7:45pm. we were informed that approximate wait time was 1hr 25 minutes. they didn't have those buzzer things (all gone!) so we were told to return at 8:30pm. returned at 8:30pm & was given one, then to be told that I had 45 more minutes of wait time. on a regular day I would be like, screw that, but I was feeling good so OK.  we got buzzed in at 9:15pm & got seated in front of the 2 guy band. songs were OK but personally, they need to jam it up a bit. it was too mellow for a Saturday night. we ordered the bistro shrimp scampi, harvest chicken salad, crispy crab wontons.  complimentary bread while u wait.  the food was very tasty. huge portion so hubby & I shared. service was great, our waitress was nice & attentive although she took awhile to come back around, but we didn't mind. my ONLY complaint... not the wait because I knew after reading the Yelp reviews that we were gonna wait.. my complaint was our B52 shots. It wasn't one. when we got it, I knew the bartender had it wrong because it was COLD. this drink comes in room temperature. it consists of grand marnier, baileys, Kahlua... prepared in that order. I don't know wtf he put in there, it had some type of green chopped something. hubby drank his & almost barffed. I told my waitress of my disappointment. some minutes later the manager came & I told her the shot was made incorrectly & I don't want to pay for it. she apologized & said of course not I won't pay for it. when the bill came in... of course not I did not pay for my shot that I refused to drink, but I was charged for hubby's one. OK I'll pay... but from the bill I knew what the bartender did not put in the shot: grand marnier. for a big & national restaurant, it was very disappointing that their bartendar(s) are not familiar with drinks. lesson learned: I wont order any special drinks not on the menu. other than that. good food experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=520

Besides that, we had such a bad dining experience we literally started laughing.   We were actually looking around for the hidden cameras as we couldn't believe it was real! Our food was inconsistent, but the service was the worst I have ever experienced.  The management should be let go for putting such a bad server on the floor.  Our waiter was a boy named Jesse and if it wasn't his first day ever in a restaurant I would be surprised. After an amazingly bad service, he capped it off by making us wait for our check for 15 minutes while he talked with the lady at the table next to us - five feet away!  If I wasn't in vacation mode I would have exploded.  Instead we got to laughing so hard I cried.

I'm pretty sure dinner here was cheaper than what we normally pay at Chili's for our family of four.  We arrived just in time to beat the dinner rush, and were seated fairly quickly.

Kevin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",774,291,184,3.0,11/30/2013,"As a local, I don't really get to come here as often. Let's be honest everyone, NO ONE likes to deal with the traffic and parking that is Waikiki.  I haven't been here in years, but recently got to return due to a little staycation and seized the opportunity. I arrived Friday around 6pm and was frantically running towards the door after seeing families and couples lining the outside seating area and walls waiting to go in. I was told my party would have to wait an hour. Ok, not as bad as it could have been. The wait passed by quickly and we were seated shortly after coming back in. Now, the one thing I usually warn people about the Cheesecake Factory is that the prices are a little steep but the portions are that much steeper. No, they are HUGE. I always have enough for a full lunch the next day. Now that's saying something, because I usually eat a lot. My favorite dish there is the Chicken Bellagio. It's bread crumb-crusted chicken filet topped with prosciutto served on a bed of basil pasta and an arugula salad on top. And like I said, it's HUGE. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. I also tried the Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms this visit and dat sauce! Need I say more? Onto dessert. Who goes to the CHEESECAKE factory without getting cheesecake?! Blasphemy. I've tried several in the past. Honorable mentions going out to the White Chocolate Raspberry, Lemoncello and the Strawberry Original. Tonight, we decided to split the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It's two layers of red velvet cake along with two layers of normal cheesecake, which equals heaven in your mouth. Done!

Marshall P.,"Brentwood Bay, Canada",0,14,1,2.0,9/6/2016,"This used to be my go to place to eat when I come to Waikiki with my family . Huge portions good flavours and great dessert with friendly service . Last night however was not the case. We ordered all the same items we always get the pasta was horrible and come on $20 for a plate of plain pasta with 4 shrimp ? Sauce had zero flavour shrimp were way over cooked and to top it out our waitress was a huge snake. We ordered way too much food and didn't eat much of it so we asked to get the food we didn't touch packed up, she didn't mention but it was so we could give it to the homeless people out front of our hotel. The woman rolled her eyes as she smiled sure . Tossed the plate on the desk and went to mention it to a male server as she looked over at us and he rolled his eyes too . As she returned with our bags of food she saw the appetizer we had packed up and was like "" oh right I forgot I already had to pack something for you here's another bag"" and just slid it on the table and walked away shaking her head . Now I'm just guessing but Cheesecake Factory is a HUGE busy restaurant here and they probably hire the best they can find because they have a name to keep In this economy I would try to do my best to make people happy and make tips so you're not the homeless person sitting on the street who's about to get the food you're so reluctant to pack to go one day .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=580

Nicholas A.,"Honolulu, HI",58,18,18,1.0,11/27/2015,"2 days ago with my classmate, who was doing a ""Restaurant Evaluation"" for Dining room. We got there about 1ish.  The guy controlling the front was polite and direct. When it came to our host, Paul, the atmosphere went from 100% satisfactory to sero really quick. He just grabbed the menus and started walking in a rush, and no one was behind us. There was no greeting at all! If there was it was under his breathe. I would have preferred a more welcoming introduction or ""have you guys been here before?"" Keeping that upbeat and positiveness. The one and only thing he did right was openning a seat for me. As awkward it kind of felt for him because I was a guy, he still did it and smiled the whole way through. I would not call this much of a ""nice save."" A smile only gets you so far, it is the attitude and actions that matters.  To start off, there was no proper greeting. Started off asking for drinks, but no formal greeting. She asked if we wanted bread, i dont know if you were suppose to make that a question. It just sounded weird when she ASKED us. As we observed, there was a lot of inconsistency. She greeted the guest next to us properly, ""I'll be your server for today."" We were working literally eating bread, and some guy with long, dreadlike hair asked if he can take it away. That was done very poorly. And we actually wanted more after. One great thing about the service today, a lot of teamwork. Towards the end though, instead of asking if we wanted dessert, she asked if we wanted dessert to-go. Is that the Cheesecake factory way? Overall, we experienced that it seemed like because we were young, our server paid little to no attention to us. But, from noticing the guests next to us, she seemed like an alright server. Aside from the end, both us and the other guest was waiting for like 15mins on our check and there were a few servers who just passed to set tables. They obviously saw that we were done and said nothing. We felt kind of discriminated possibly because the thoughts of us having a lack of knowledge on serving. I enjoyed observing because this was a perfect example of ""Poor service"". Wheres the smiles? Where is the welcoming, Aloha-spirit?  The only reason they deserve one star and because I can't do 0 is their timing on food. Food was amazing, as always! Nicely done with portion sizes and presentation. The Front of House was very inconsistent, disriminating, and unwelcoming. Very rushy, like they didn't want to serve us. I mean, would you like to take-out any dessert? What if we wanted dessert there?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=580
Kristen K.,"Honolulu, HI",276,270,557,4.0,7/9/2013,"So this place rocks.  That is IF you can get over the fact that a.) they don't take reservations (for ANY amount of people), and b.) if the quoted 1-2 HOUR wait time doesn't completely turn you off. In any case, I present you with option c.) wait for one of the bar tables to open up (the high tops)....they are on a first-come basis. I would never (NEVER) wait that long for a restaurant. EVER. I'd rather go around the corner to McDonalds than take a little beeper and wonder what to do with myself for 120 minutes. What a waste of time! Apparently, I lack patience, whereas a lot of people do not...and they choose to suffer and endure this ungodly wait time for a table. To each's own, I guess.  Bonus points for me that I discovered that I know an old friend that now works here. So the last time we went, I got hooked up with a table super quick! Scoreeeee!  Anyway, so once you do get a table, then be ready to browse through the most extensive menu ever. It is ridiculous. But in a very, very good way. There is SO MUCH to choose from....the hard part is actually narrowing down the choices! Everything I've had here to-date has been pretty good, too. Nothing completely mind blowing, but consistent and satisfying. I always leave full and happy. I like their veggie salad (huge bowl....good to share!), their corn cakes app, and their slider combo that comes with fries. YUMM. And of course, no matter what, I am always forced against my will to eat some cheesecake or one of their other delicious desserts at the end of my meal.  Parking is validated at the Royal Hawaiian structure.  Overall, a great place that will have something for everyone in your group!

The host who seated us was very nice, funny and professional. So hard to balance that but I have to say that he did a really good job. The waitress we had was fantastic! I wish I had asked what her name was so I could ask for her section again.  I got the pizza & salad lunch special and it was great and big enough for 2 or one really hungry person. I wanted to share with  my friend, but unfortunately we didn't do that. I got the hawaiian pizza and caesar salad. The hawaiian pizza had kalua pig, pineapple, red peppers and red onions. The pizza wasn't much to look at but it was so delicious that I wanted to keep eating it. The half salad I got was also pretty big and had a lot of dressing on it, I would highly recommend asking for your dressing on the side, I know I will. We all shared the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake and it was absolutely delicious. Because there were 4 of us sharing we were given an extra dollop of whipped cream.

Chad Y.,"Honolulu, HI",1057,1234,446,3.0,3/28/2011,"I understand why residents flock to the sole branch of the Cheesecake Factory in Hawaii, however I don't get the masses who come from other cities that have Cheesecake Factories and wait for an hour, just to get a table for four. It's the same menu! Anyway, the Waikiki location of the Cheesecake Factory is simply another restaurant for me that offers an insanely large menu, decent service, and a nice ambiance. It doesn't offer anything outstanding (beside an outstandingly LONG wait time for a table), however at the same time the food and service certainly doesn't disappoint.  Let's start off with the obvious, if you during the lunch or dinner rush, be prepared to wait and wait for a table. It is a rather large location, however the masses come and it can be quite a bit of wait for a table and they do not take reservations.  The menu is large and will please any palate. It is by far the largest menu selection I have ever come across (and build it yourself burger combination's don't count). However, if I'm paying for my meal, I really don't want to see ads in the menu for local establishments, nice marketing touch, but a little un-classy in my book.  The food is decent, however there are only a few highlights for me. The fried macaroni and cheese is heaven. If there was ever a moment I could die happily from one bite of food it would be that item. Nicely cooked macaroni with the perfect blend of cheeses and coated in a perfected layer of bread crumbs and deep fried, what is not to like about that! Their shepherd's pie is pretty good and I have to say I was rather impressed with the perfect blend of meats and vegetables to mashed potato ratio along with the homestyle flavors that come through. Everything else on the menu I've had such as the chinese chicken salad and their burgers and sandwiches are all decent, however nothing outstanding or noteworthy. Oh, note, the portions are pretty good sized, so if you have an appetite, you certainly can get your money's worth. Now, that's out of the way, let's be honest. You came to the CHEESECAKE factory for cheesecake? It would be weird if you went there for a sundae in my book. Anyway, the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake is bites of heaven if the mood for chocolate strikes you. The texture is a little heavier than your standard cheesecake, however the rich and bold chocolate flavors will certainly put a buckle in your knees. Try the Dulce De Leche cheesecake if the mood for caramel strikes you or perhaps the Strawberry if you want something sweeter. Note, the strawberries they put on are large and amazingly good. The Chocolate Raspberry Truffle is a nice blend if you want something sweet and savory and the Oreo cheesecake is perfect for the cookie lover in us all. Did I mention I like cheesecake... Service is good with the wait staff being extremely pleasant and generally speaking very attentive. It has been rare that my water has gotten close to empty and they are quick to check in on you and the food arrives in a wonderful orchestration. Parking is available in the Royal Hawaiian Center lot and it is a bit of walk from the garage, but they validate for up to two hours. The ambiance is comfortable and while dimly lit, it serves its purpose well for group outings or that nice dinner for two. If you just want dessert and go, the cheesecake counter is right at the front of the store and you can always take your dessert out on the beach! Dessert and service are certainly extreme highlights, however it certainly doesn't make up for the long wait and the so-so meal menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=580
Keith A.,"Bend, OR",84,254,764,5.0,3/24/2013,"Previous 5 star review still stands.  In short, this is great food at a decent price with huge portions.  If you sit on the patio and arrive before 5, I'd be surprised if you left here dissatisfied.  We dined here Saturday 3/16 and felt it was one of the best meals we had this trip. Enough reviews on the food, service and normal topics.  What I want to share here is the insightful discussion we had with our sever that impressed us on many levels. There was a fire in the kitchen earlier this year that shut the restaurant down for about a month.  We had read about it in our online edition of the Honolulu Star Advertiser shortly after it happened and were immediately inquisitive about how corporate handled it with their staff, etc. I'm pleased to report that according to our server they really stepped up and took care of everybody.  First, some interesting stats: this is one of the busiest locations in the nation. With over 400 on staff, they seat between 4,000 and 5,000 people PER DAY.  That alone amazed us. The efficiency of this place is astounding. Our server said that one of the first things they did was have several get togethers with tons of free food.  There isn't another Cheesecake Factory nearby so they couldn't transfer the inventory. Corporate gave it all away to the staff.   Secondly, they took care of them financially.  Granted, with the numbers they push through here, it wasn't practical to let everyone go and then re-hire and attempt to train again in a month, so paying everyone while the restaurant was inoperable was really the best business decision. Still, corporate is to be commended on their fairness.  They averaged their employees last six weeks of 2012 including tips and came up with a weekly salary.  In addition, they also allowed for you to cash in vacation time if you so desired. Our server said some employees grumbled, thinking they should have gotten more but not him. He thought it was more than fair and even took the opportunity to take his family on vacation.

Oscar V.,"Plymouth, MI",0,29,31,1.0,9/28/2014,One star for the Chef working the kitchen. I understand it's extremely busy however I'm very disappointed in the service and shockingly the food. My wife and I ordered a factory shop salad and fish tacos at exactly 1:08 pm and we received half of the order at 1:48pm. The fish tacos were missing the side salad and ingredients not to mention we got a Cobb salad instead of the factory chopped salad we had ordered. So we waited another 12 minutes and we received another salad that was not the one we ordered. The pictures above demonstrate the quality of food we received notice the to go bag was full of tomato juice so disappointed.  The salad was suppose to have chicken but instead just plain. The whole experience sucked. The manager on duty didn't care at all. This is the worst money spent on this vacation.

The bartender was super busy but made it a point to let us know that she saw us and to let her know when she was ready. When we were ready we ordered our first round of drinks, and she gave us some time to look over the menu. The menu is HUGE, so many options, but a little overwhelming. But it's great when you don't know what you want, because there is a little of everything.  We finally decided on two burgers. Real original, I know. The guy next to us got his food before us, and he ordered a while after us. The bartender noticed as well and immediately got someone's attention and asked them to check on our food.  A few minutes went by with nothing, so she called for a manager. A manager was over by our side promptly,  apologizing for the food taking longer than expected. He told us that when we finished our burgers that desert was on them and even if we were full to order it to go.  While we waited for our burgers, another patron was talking to the bartender as if he knew her and his laugh was contagious. He seemed funny and someone full of spunk and stories. So we decided to send him over a shot. He was awesome and came to thank us. :) Our burgers came!!! Yeah! The food itself was good. Nothing over the top, cooked to the temp that we ordered!!  The burgers were huge, I couldn't finish mine. (which is rare) we were soooooo full!!! So, we ordered the red velvet cheesecake to go. (it was amazing)  The manager came back over to apologize again for the slow service (it ended up being a mix up in the kitchen) and said because we only got one desert that he took off the shot that we ordered. It was so nice, over the top and not expected. Thank you!!  Also, another thank you to the waiter that was so nice, polite and had such good positive vibes. He wasn't our waiter, but he was walking by and my bf was curious to what drinks he was carrying and he took the time to stop tell us what drinks they were, what was in them, and he even suggested his favorite. It was just really nice because he took the time to stop and talk to us, he wasn't annoyed or taken back.  The bartender's name was Erica, the waiter was Joe, and I apologize I forget the managers name, but I want to say it was Bryan. (but I'm not 100% sure on that one) the three of them deserve some recognition for thier outstanding service!!!

On our visit to the island, being from Australia, the Cheesecake Factory is a very hard place to walk past. We had walked down the Main Street quite a few nights in a row to find that the Cheesecake Factory ALWAYS had massive lines out the front. This one night, we finally bit the bullet and decided to line up. About 45 minutes went past of being in this line, till we finally walk through the front door. Another 10 minutes goes by, and yes. We made it to the front of the line. The server asks how many people, which we reply only two. The server then hands over a pager & tells us to wait outside till we are called. Are you kidding me I think to myself.  We were at the edge of wanting to walk away but hung in there because of the journey so far.  Another 35 minutes later and we were in. Like all other Cheesecake Factories, the menu is about as long as the Bible. The quality of the food was much the same as the main land, however lacked something I couldn't quite put my finger on. The staff were lovely, however they seemed to rush you a little, but judging by the line out the front that kept on growing, it was somewhat understandable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=560

We had to wait several minutes to get our new pasta dish. The cheesecake was spot-on and so were the avocado egg rolls. My mood was quite bad with the chicken in the pasta - the waiter saw this so he credited us money for the pasta dish.

Are you a newlywed or something? Well do you want to stay married? Then this is not your spot. This restaurant has the longest and unnecessary wait time on the Waikiki strip. Every night I see dozens of people with these sad, starved faces sitting around the Royal Hawaiian waiting for their little buzzer to buzz for more than an hour, when they can go right across the street and get a great meal for less money. It makes zero sense, because you aren't getting anything here you can't get at any other Cheesecake Factory. Actually that's partially true. You will definitely get a bill priced higher than what you are used to seeing. But hey, if you flew all the way to Waikiki to pay for it, who am I to judge. Food wise, consistency wise, and quality wise, this location is on par with the rest of the chain. I've eaten here twice (situations beyond my control) and never had an issue.

So we started to worry and politely asked again how long its gonna be and that it never buzzed we waited over our expected time frame, they looked confused and basically got us a table within seconds with no explanation. My guess is they messed up and didn't want us to complain so they sat us as soon as possible. The staff was friendly but in my opinion they need to check there equipment, and no apologizes or explanation, makes me uncomfortable.   Other then that service was fast, friendly, food was great, the filet minogne was soft like buttah!

Sure the food is delicious but it's not that amazing that you have to wait an hour and a half just to sit down. The only thing I am extremely impressed with is their honey oat bread and their selection of cheesecake. You don't really need an entree with their bottomless bread basket and the size of their appetizers. But they have a large selection of entrees so it appeals more to the picky eater. Also their entrees are good, being from New York its hard to find pizza out here that I actually will order again. Their portions are large so it's almost worth the price. Except for the cocktails, they're small and really not worth it. Just order water like a normal person and go have happy hour at a bar.

Just because we are Oriental doesn't mean we can't speak English! We told them we wanted an American server, so we got seated already. The server was nice, very happy and energetic. We ordered our dish then she brought out our drinks and the bread. I guess it's because that the place is crowded and packed with customers that our food took a very long time to be served.

It was the middle of the afternoon and my husband and I wanted to sit down somewhere to grab a bite.  You can never go wrong with CF so we put our name down.  The wait wasn't too long - about 20 minutes or so.  We were given a pager for when our table was ready.  The good part is CF is smack in the middle of the shopping area so you can go inside the neighboring stores while your partner (haha) waits outside so you're still within the radio frequency! We decided to order just one kalua pig pizza as again, we weren't really hungry and just wanted to rest.  We decided on this pizza because we hadn't seen it on any other CF menu we've eaten at and was the most 'hawaiian' one there - except for the obvious Hawaiian pizza of course, but you can get that anywhere. The pizza was a perfect small-ish size for us!  I love any slow roasted pork on anything.  This one was nicely salted with red onions and little pieces of sweet mango!  Nice addition.  Would definitely recommend this pizza to others. Service is always good and consistent all across all CF's i've been to. One star decreased because they don't take resos... but considering how busy they are, business-wise they don't need to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=600

Extremely crowded for dinner and expect to wait at least an hour on weekends. Much better to go for lunch or early dinner. We were a party of 2 and ordered simple dishes with no special requests aside from requesting the Ceasar Salad with my lunch pizza. The waitress did not write down our order but repeated it back to us before she put it in. Food came out before my drink which was forgotten and ended up with the house salad instead of the Ceasar.

I didn't say anything but I guess she noticed that I looked surprised so she offered to give it back to me after she already took the dirty one and she ask if I wanted a new knife and of course since she already mixed it with the dirty dishes she took away from us. The butter never was given to us after she agreed. We ordered coffee and she just slammed the coffee in front of us.. We still tipped her but she is clumsy server.

Randall S.,"Kaneohe, HI",19,200,63,4.0,9/3/2015,"I admit it...I'm a closet cheesecake addict and for years tend to grade restaurants on how good their cheesecake is.  But to go to a restaurant actually named after my favorite dessert???  I must've died and gone to Heaven!  What's even better is this is a chain!  So I've been to The Cheesecake Factory Restaurants in Seattle and LA but Hawaii's is the best!  (Not to mention the World's Busiest Cheesecake Factory.)  Okay, so what's the bad news?  First, they don't take reservations so it's first come, first serve so you could end up waiting 1- 2 hours before getting seated and it's in Waikiki where parking is a bear.  The good news is they have kick-butt cheesecake!  Oops, need to get back on track...  Situated in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, you can park in their parking structure so bad news #2 is no longer a problem.  As for the seating, try to go for an early dinner or perhaps lunch when the crowds aren't too bad.  Weekdays are better than weekends for getting tables.  The larger your party is (i.e. more than 4 people), the better an idea it is to go off-schedule.  But once you're seated, be prepared to have your brain explode!  They have an extensive menu offering food for all palates from the simple (burgers on a bun) to more sophisticated dishes (fresh catch of the day like opakapaka).  So it's not possible to not have something that someone doesn't want.  The fresh bread appetizers is a nice thing to munch on while waiting for your food.  Once it comes, I hope you're hungry because these folks provide industrial size servings.  It's a major accomplishment if you can eat all your food without having to take home the leftovers.  But you may want to do that.  Why?  Because you'll have no space for the 5 billion different cheesecake dishes they offer!  Just like their meals, they have peanut butter flavored cheesecake to chocolate cheesecake to just regular cheesecake.  They've taken the humble cheesecake to a whole new level.  Fortunately all is not lost and if you don't have any space, you can always order the cheesecake to be packed to take home.  The servers are always excellent and food and used dishes appear and disappear like magic.  It's not easy to get to the restaurant but I promise is well worth the effort.  Bon Appetit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=620
John N.,"Honolulu, HI",313,466,96,3.0,1/12/2013,"Pros: -Every single dish I've tried here are quite tasty. Some dishes have great portions and others are quite small. -Service. One of the best service you can get in a restaurant in Waikiki. These guys here at pros and work their butts off every day. Cons: - Takes way too long to get your food. The problem stems is that this restaurant is very packed and the kitchen does look a lil smaller than what you expect for a restaurant this size. - Price. Jesus H Christ it is expensive here. You will break your wallet if you eat here often. - With the name Cheesecake Factory, you figure their Cheesecake is good. Wrong. The cheesecake tastes old and not fresh and it is VERY expensive too.

Steven B.,"Orlando, FL",4393,1179,825,4.0,12/13/2012,So how crazy busy is this Cheesecake Factory you ask? Here are some hints -  * It's steps away from Waikiki beach.  * It's open normal hours and busier than the Las Vegas location which is open 24/7. * It's the highest grossing location in the chain. A bartender told me 26M in 2012!  That's right; 26 million from one location!  * At peak times the waits are two hours plus. The crowds are so huge you'd think a superstar was about to arrive.  So would I wait two hours for a meal? Absolutely not but that doesn't mean I don't love these folks. I've never had a bad meal here. The menu is ginormous and the variety will satisfy everyone. The prices are commensurate with the quality and huge portions. The adult libations are strong and the waitstaff is competent. This chain does it right.

Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",378,724,4176,5.0,11/22/2010,"I wanted to write a brief update about my recent visit for Sunday brunch: Sunday brunch is served from 10am to 2pm, and consists of 13 items with the 13th item being a ""kids"" brunch sized portion.  Sunday brunch items include pancakes, waffles, eggs benedict, and steak and eggs.  I went with a friend, and after looking over their menu I decided to order the Baja Chicken Hash, while my friend decided to order the Crab Hash. Both of these dishes come with your choice of tomatoes or potatoes, as well as white toast, wheat toast, or a plain bagel.  Please see  for the full Sunday Brunch menu, as well as their complete menu offerings. NOTE:  The plain bagel comes with cream cheese, while the toast comes with strawberry jam. For the 2 dishes that we ordered, I thought the price we paid was very reasonable for the portion sizes.  I was so tempted to finish my entire dish, but were it not for the fact that I wanted to save room for dessert I most likely would have devoured all of my food!  Seriously, no visit to Cheesecake Factory would be complete without dessert!!  My friend decided to order the red velvet cheesecake, while I choose the 30th Anniversary chocolate cheescake.  Now let me just say this chocolate cheesecake, a hybrid of their original cheesecake and fudge cake, was simply delicious!  Your taste buds will be doing the happy dance for hours on end.  Amazingly, I finished nearly the entire piece of cheesecake.   SERVICE:  The service on this visit was phenomenal!  The server was just so friendly, outgoing, polite, helpful, and the list goes on and on.  Exceptional service indeed.

Dined in a few minutes after they opened, which is probably the best time considering that after maybe 10-20 minutes, the place got packed! It took awhile for my bf & I to decide what to eat because it was hard to pick from the many different choices on their menu. But while we needed more time, our waiter offered us some bread & butter. We finally made our orders, I got the combo of the Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi with mashed potatoes, my bf got the hamburger steak dinner portion & we also ordered the deep fried mac & cheese & fried calamari. Once our food came in soon after, we realized we got too much food. The portions here are huuuuuge! The fried calamari was yummy, which came with 2 sauces a garlic mayo & a marinara sauce. The fried Mac & cheese was very cheesy. My combo plate was so full of flavor but the hamburger steak wasn't anything special though. We didn't end up finishing our plates so we got take out for our left overs.  Besides the many entree choices, there are also many cheesecake choices! For dessert we ordered the white chocolate caramel macadamia cheesecake & an original cheesecake with fresh strawberries. I didn't like the white chocolate caramel macadamia, I love sweets but this was just too sweet for me. So the original with strawberries was the best one.

Just to explain about the noise...We were seated all the way in the back adjacent to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.  Unfortunately there was at outside party that night at the hotel and the loudness of the base and music made it difficult for us to carry a conversation, hear our waiter and it was just a bad experience.  It's too bad they don't have the option to close the outside when theres events being held at the hotel.   I could tell that we weren't the only ones that weren't enjoying ourselves.  Some of the older Japanese tourists were covering their ears and making faces.  I don't mind noise in restaurants, but this was just bad.   Now the food.  We had a party of 8, and everyone ordered something different so we all can taste because there are SO MUCH items to choose from!!!  To be honest, they could get rid of a lot, because they jut did not taste great.  Not to be too critical, but I think you would have high expectations especially when the wait time is so long.  To tell you the truth, none of they entrees we ordered had a wow factor.  It was just all ""okay"". The only great or tasty meal we enjoyed is again, the bread, cheesecake, and the spicy ahi tempura roll. Ah service...it was eh, ok.  When they brought out our food, they told my mom that they're still cooking her asparagus and it would be out shortly.  My mom waited and waited, and just started to eat her meal.  Of course it never came, and when the waiter came to check up on us, she explained that she was still waiting.    You could tell she was upset, and he brought the manager over.  The manager and over apologizing with a plate of asparagus (which was only 2 pieces), and she said that she didn't want it since she was already done eating .  The manager then offered ""1"" free cheesecake. ONE!?  Are u kidding me?  We've gone to other restaurants and they would take a percentage off the bill and they only thing he offered was a slice of cheesecake!?    Kinda mind boggling, but they're just not interested in customers returning I guess. I remember eating here years ago and remembering the food tasting a lot better.    My advice is to skip the wait, don't waste your time, and they sell cheesecakes at Costco, so YOU know WHERE to go! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=680

Bad food and a bad waitress.  We waited at the bar and got drinks and an app. The bartender was great. When we got our table, we immediately ordered. 20 min go by and the waitress says, ""I just checked on your food and it will be just a couple of more minutes."" 20 more minutes until we finally get our food. In the mean time, a couple who sat down 30 min after us got their food. When we did get our food, the items ranged from cold to luke warm. The plates obviously sat in the window. The butter wasnt melting on my mashed potatoes because they werent hot. My hubby's plate was missing his tempura asparagus and his food was cold too.  When he notified the waitress to tell her about the missing food, she said she knew but she never mentioned anything about the missing food when she dropped our plates. Nor did she tell him the asparagus was coming. My hubby asked her to take the plate back and he didn't want a replacement. She left with a sour look on her face.  Manager Marshall came to us within 5 min and was very cordial. He attempted to make it right and comped both of our entrees. My hubby was over it and refused another plate. Marshall asked if it was ok for our server to come back to us and we agreed.  However, a different server came to finish our meal until it was time for the check.  He was nice and I started to feel better about the night although my man was still upset. Then the original server came back and she did not offer an apology. In fact, she slammed the check down with a mumbled ""thank you"" and ran away.  I deliberately left her zero tip. My man is currently a server and I was a server throughout college. Her behavior was unacceptable. The manager and second server made a good attempt at service recovery for her screw up but her sour attitude ruined it.  Total 2 hour wait for our entrees, one of which we sent back. Not worth it.

Isa R.,"Honolulu, HI",389,332,833,4.0,7/9/2012,"On food alone, this place would get 5 stars.  It's actually one of my favorite restaurants to go to period. So why only 4 stars? (1)  You have to park at the Royal Hawaiian and walk over.  It's not THAT far of a walk, but still.  It's not easy to just run in and get take out.  Plus, the location is in Waikiki.  I reallllly don't like coming into Waikiki if I don't have to.  If they built another one on island that wasn't in Waikiki, you can guarantee I'd be there all the time! (2)  Twice I've gone there and they ran out of over half the cheesecakes, AKA, all of the flavors I'd want.  It reminds me of when I went to Buca di Beppo and they said they ran out of cheese.  An Italian restaurant running out of CHEESE?!?  That knocked out 93.7% of the menu.   (3)  The wait for dinner is insane.  Like, 2 hours, insane.  Wish they took reservations.  I suggest if you're having a craving, go during lunch time.  I went at around 1 PM on a weekend recently and we waited only 5 minutes.  I dig that.  If you're waiting for dinner, I suggest trekking over to Forever 21 next door.  That store is huge.  Great place to kill time.  Just make sure your buzzer thing is within reach, or make sure someone else who's with you stays closer to the restaurant with it.  :D The food is what keeps me coming back the few times I brave the wait and craziness of Waikiki.  I alwaayyssss have to order the calamari.  It comes with cocktail sauce and some kind of garlic aioli (I really don't know, but it tastes delicious).  Probably one of my favorite places to get calimari, period. The menu is so extensive here, but I pretty much always end up getting the steak diane and salmon combo.  Aaaand the oreo cheesecake to top off the meal doesn't hurt either.  I wish they had some kind of cheesecake sampler though.  I always want to try different flavors but am always worried I won't like it.  Also, best strawberry lemonade.  Period.  They don't just use lemonade with strawberry syrup, they blend real strawberries.  You can see the strawberry seeds in the glass.  Free refills at that.  ;) Build one in Kapolei or something!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=680

But I think it's worth it! :D I came here so many times for friend's birthdays, and even for work occasions. It really is one of my favorite places to eat in Waikiki, for both lunch and dinner. If you are coming here for dinner, I think you should definitely come earlier than you intend to eat. The waiting after 6pm is terrible... when my friends literally decided on last minute to eat here, we had to wait like about a couple of hours for a table. We were so annoyed cause we were dying to eat after 5 hours of karaoke. But good thing the neighboring stores helped us to kill time. We spent some time in Apple Store and Forever 21. The first time I came here, I ordered the charbroiled flat iron steak. It was good, but very tough to bite AND cut. I had a hard time, but maybe that's cause I'm kinda weak and have no upper body strength but still. The fried calamari appetizer was delicious though. After coming back often, I found out that my favorite appetizer is definitely the spicy ahi tempura roll. I could literally just eat that and be full. But I also do like eating the fetticini alfredo as well :D andddd last but not least, they have the best cheesecake. I don't have a favorite since me and my friends always like trying new and different ones everytime we come here.

It took longer for our waitress to acknowledge our existence once we were seated. She didn't show up for a good 20-25 minutes. From there, we ordered our food, which took even longer. Instead of updating us on our food, she kept apologizing that there was no bread. We were there at 9pm, so there is no reason they should be short on bread, but we just wanted our food. When the food arrived, we felt underwhelmed. My usual cheesesteak sandwich was nasty. My wife's pasta that was supposed to have artichokes was pretty barren. All we got were apologies about the bread, which came after our food. When we told the waitress we didn't want dessert, she seemed very put off that we weren't ordering more.  If you want the same Cheesecake Factory you get at home, you will be sorely disappointed. Go to a local joint instead.

Jou L.,"Honolulu, HI",156,64,2,1.0,3/6/2016,"Had a gift certificate to eat at this restaurant. When we entered the restaurant the host immediately took us to a table near the bar.  Since the table was not set, he asked us to wait but being that we were blocking the aisle decided to sit down at the table to get out of the way. Out of nowhere two servers approach the table and the female server tells us ""this is not first come first serve"" as they thought we had just walked in and sat down. I told her that the host had seated us there. The male server then said ""if you each give me $10.00 you can sit here"". Already taken aback by the female server, I told them again ""the host sat us here!"". He then told me he was joking. They both walked away without an apology.  What a great first impression of this place. NOT! I did speak to the manager and asked her why they are not trained to ask first before assuming something. I was offended by the manner that we were treated. I also told her that there is only one chance to make a first impression and that I was not impressed and would probably never eat there again.  I also shared with her that my complaint probably didnt matter because they had such a large tourist base but that to the local customer it does matter how another resident is treated. The food, ah just OK.  I had the tomato basil pasta. Not very flavorful and the pasta was undercooked and very chewy.  Save your money and eat across the street at California Pizza Kitchen where the pasta is always al dente and the service unlike the cattle service and treatment at the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=660

We figure it's going to be crazy busy (yes it was) so we walk it down to kill time.  My two boys starving waiting to scarf down some steak. We get there after a 15 minute walk and make our way inside through the craziness outside and the line trying to get in.  We ask one of the hostesses where we needed to go for take out orders and she points us to a long line by the cheesecakes.  After about a 10 minute wait, the customer behind us asks another employee if we were in the correct place for take out orders because everyone else seemed to be ordering cheesecakes.  The employee tells us we are in the cheesecake line and need to go to another register! Upset and starving at this point, we excuse our way through another mess of people to the register and the cashier is busy looking busy.  (Who knows what the heck she was doing.  She didn't acknowledge me yet.)  So I tell her I'm picking up a take-out order.  After a few more seconds she asks for my name.  I give her my name and she can't find anything.  I give her my wife's name, nothing.  She asks what I ordered.  So I tell her and she picks up some receipts and starts punching stuff in.  Then she asks me again what I ordered.  Nothing.  She tells me hold on and walks to the back.  Tack on 5 more minutes.  She comes back and tells me she is waiting for someone in the office to transfer orders to her, but said she saw food that looks like my order in the back.  She asks me again for my name and disappears to the back again.  5 more minutes, my son is complaining because he is starving, and a gentleman standing next to me tells me he's been waiting there for an hour already.  I'm surrounded by people who don't look too happy.  The cashier finally returns, this time with back up.  The guy who came with her tells me ""apparently"" SOMEONE lost my order and they would have to place my order and I would have to ""wait a bit."" So I tell him that the cashier said she saw an order that looked like mine in the back but they would have to start all over again and I would have to wait even longer than I and my starving family already had AFTER calling ahead to avoid waiting!  He said yes.  I shook my head and told him Happy New Year and walked away as he shrugged his shoulders.

The server was very good.  After going over the menu several times, it's 17-20 pages long. I ordered the ""skinnylisious"" salad/w chicken. My husband ordered the factory burger. My salad could've fed 3 or 4 people. My only gripe is there was hardly any chicken in it! For $19 I would at least expect 4-6oz of it. That kind of bummed me out. I've had this salad at other locations and it was generous.  Couldn't eat all greens, I dug through it thinking there was chicken in the bottom. ZERO! Oh well.  My hubby's burger was good but he gave it a 7 out of 10. He's a burger lover. Says his fav is Five Guys (you can adjust your scale from there).  We ordered the Lemon meringue cheesecake. We only had a couple bites cause we were kinda full and got the rest to go. OMG Yes, it was beyond yummy! THIS IS WHY ITS CALLED CHEESECAKE FACTOR! It was still yummy when we ate they rest later.

We walked in and the wait was less than 5mins which was awesome. They were even kind enough to switch our table to a booth :) our waitress was on-point, super friendly and very helpful. My husband got the the club sandwich with a salad and I got the cheesesteak with fries. Everything was hot and well worth it. But the BEST PART of all was our CHEESECAKE!! I got a double Oreo cheesecake and he got a white caramel macadamia nut one.  AMAZEBALLS thank you Ashley for the wonderful service. We will definitely be back.

Micah F.,"Portage, IN",0,1,,2.0,3/12/2016,"The only pro is that the food always taste good. I ate here three times in one week while on vacation. The wait time is always long, the service once seated isn't very good, the waitress didn't  ever serve us our appetizer one time, and another time the appetizer was served with our meal not before. One of the times our buzzer went off to be seated and we came to the front desk in which they told us to wait near by, then 3 other groups were told the same thing after us and then got seated before us while we waited another 15 minutes because they forgot about us. One of the times we were never offered Parmesan for our pasta, and the portions were significantly smaller on one of the dishes in which we had gotten two other times that week.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=640
Faye M.,"Honolulu, HI",259,697,310,4.0,7/7/2011,"I once decided to have my birthday dinner here and knew the wait would be long - especially with 20 people...so I planned accordingly: told my friends that dinner is at 8, and since the wait would be long - we will all meet there at 6. If I had to wait, so did everyone else! It was MY BIRTHDAY, after all! It all worked out well and I had no regrets!  Anyway, I love coming here for any meal, but I hardly every have room for dessert :( But I don't really care for cheesecake anyway - I usually get the carrot cake! It's soo huge and delicious - the last time, it lasted me 4 days!  I really like their Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Sandwich - I saw it featured on the Oprah show as Chris Rock's favorite sandwich a loooong time ago and have been eating it ever since! It's clubhouse sandwich style - so there's that 3rd slice of bread in the middle, but guess what! You can ask to have it without that slice...it makes it slightly smaller and less messier. A waiter asked me if I wanted it like that way a few years back, and that's the only way I eat it now! With Sweet Potato Fries...so good, you don't even need ketchup!  Best time to go is lunch and early, early dinner! Or, you can try to bypass the wait and grab a high top in the bar area - those are open for anyone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=640
Nicole A.,"Mililani, HI",2042,103,1402,4.0,10/4/2012,"Pros: The food is excellent here. Menu items are a little pricey but the portions are plentiful and very delicious! Love the layout of the restaurant, with an open seat area overlooking the Waikiki streets. Once seated, the service is normally quick and the servers are very friendly.  Cons:  1- Wait time: If u want to eat here, come early (when they first open for lunch time and early evening for dinner time). Do not come during the busy hours unless you're willing to wait sometimes up to an hour and a half. Yes, I'm serious. We showed up once during dinner time and was told the wait was that long. No, we didn't wait. It was already 8:00 pm, and with a little one, we needed to hurry and head back to the hotel to put him to bed.  2- Parking: No private parking. This is in the heart of Waikiki! What do you expect!  You have to park in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center parking structure and walk through the mall to the opposite end. It's not a very far walk, but nonetheless, it's a walk.

Joseph Joel B.,"Mililani, HI",1979,63,1427,4.0,7/27/2014,"IF YOU LOVE CHEESECAKE, YOU NEED TO COME HERE!! Even if you don't love cheesecake, you still need to come here!! =) First of all, The Cheesecake Factory is located along the infamous Waikiki Strip on Kalakaua Avenue in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. Parking is free in the shopping center as long as you get your ticket validated at the reception desk. For those of you who have never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, there is more to this restaurant than just cheesecake... SO MUCH MORE!! Their huge menu is one of the largest I have seen for any given restaurant, which makes it both a blessing and a curse... I certainly love their wide variety of selections, but it also makes it very difficult to choose!! And don't expect to get seated right away at this Waikiki location... It is almost always extremely busy, and you would be considered really lucky if your wait is less than 30 minutes. Probably the best times to go are weekdays during lunch. Dinners and weekends are definitely the busiest. But being that busy just shows you that there's something good in store for you inside. Like I said earlier, the menu is FRICKEN HUGE!! So determining what to actually eat might take awhile. But whatever you decide to order, I can guarantee you that it will be a hearty portion!! I almost always have a problem with not finishing my food, and that's not even counting the dessert!! I have eaten at this particular Cheesecake Factory at least a dozen times, and normally I get my usuals... Crispy Crab Wontons and the Miso Salmon... Both, in my opinion, are exceptional dishes and I have never been disappointed by ordering them at this restaurant or any Cheesecake Factory restaurant for that matter!! I haven't really tried anything else, except occasionally tasting some of my friends dishes, but anything you order is pretty much going to be good and have good portions. And finally, THE DESSERT!! I absolutely love cheesecake and always have a problem choosing one from their three dozen selections they have on hand... AND THAT'S JUST THE CHEESECAKE!! For you non-cheesecake lovers, they also have different cakes and ice creams to choose from. I'm normally too stuffed by the end of my regular meal, so I get dessert to go. So if you're willing to wait to be seated, The Cheescake Factory really does have something for everybody, and not just cheesecake!! =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=640

Their menu is extensive(!) so I can't say that I've tried most things. BUT the things that I have tried, I've liked.  I love their strawberry lemonade. I dig their avocado egg rolls. The firecracker salmon app is yummy. Fried mac n cheese balls are also great. Their meatloaf tastes just like mama made it.  The chicken madiera has never let me down. The bistro shrimp pasta, strangely, tastes better on the mainland.  Their salads are ginormous. And I love, love, love their dulce de leche cheesecake.  Service is friendly. However, I wouldn't wait over 90 minutes to eat here. It's too bad the cheesecake factory is located in waikiki. All the tourists flood this joint.

I made the mistake of sharing both fries, chicken nachos, and tortilla soup with only another person since the food is in huge portions. Make sure to get the nachos if you are  hungry because its a lot of food! Location is pretty great, more towards the shopping district than the water. Outside seating is really cool and gives you a great view of tourists and the street, albeit it might take you a little bit longer since the demand is higher.

(Welcome to my world.)  Yes, like many of the previous reviews I had been to numerous Cheesecake Factory outlets . ( Redondo Beach;Pasadena ;Beverly Hills)   It is however unfair to make comparisons , you see this is Hawaii where you should leave your expectations at the airport counter and just have a good time and enjoy where you are ,paradise it's not too hard .. I have been doing it for 10 years  That's how long we have been coming here. ( some voices have come and gone but,needless to say they are still multiple) Yes, there will be a wait,after all this is the busiest restaurant in ALL of Hawaii . Stop whining about it . It's either you want to be here or you don't . Stop complaining about the wait,come when they open the wait will be minimal.(see how easy the remedy to your conundrum was.) There's got to be more to your lives than to leave miserable & frankly mean spirited reviews for this place,consider this facts. Over 100+ employees at a given shift ; 2000+ meals a day served those are staggering numbers for any restaurant operations . Yet , selfish as we all are we want perfection , our excuse is that we are customers & we are paying for it .... That's not an excuse to be rude & belligerent to other humans. Yes, that was you we are talking about. So let it go already .  Here's the scoop . We have had excellent service to mediocre service. We have had superb food to meh food. But , we keep coming back !!! Why you may ask? We think the Cheesecake Factory is just like us ... With multiple personalities .  There will be good days and they will be bad days. It does not matter what Rx you have been ingesting...in the end it will always be that....multiple personalities. Just accept it . As they say acceptance is the hardest pill  to swallow .

Unreal and unbelievable how slow service was. But hey gave her the benefit of the doubt. So she took 15 minutes before she even greeted us. We sat there no menu no water. Then she got our order wrong and charged us for an extra meal which I caught by reviewing my bill.  Because the service was slow and she screwed up the order plus we were there mostly waiting during  our 2 hour sit I honestly wanted to tip her less than 10%.. however I tipped her 10% not the 15 18 or 20% she made sure to point out on the bottom of the bill.  Then as we exit she stops us after looking at the bill. She says excuse me you tipped me wrong. And that we were supposed to tip her the 20%. What a fool. Shes lucky she even got 10%. Unreal how her customer service and etiquette was... Simply rude and lacking common sense. She must've never got the memo that small parties arent required to tip any given amount. Hey heres a tip for you Katrina... check yo self before you approach your customers and try embarrassing them... you only embarrassed yourself in front your manager and colleagues.

I did, however, inform the waitress to tell the cooks that it was incredibly salty.

Note that you should probably show up before lunch/dinner rush because you will most likely wait a LONG time. We arrived between 5-5:30. The only thing about the whole experience was that our table was SO close to the table next to us. I felt like I had to whisper not to bother the couple next to us but couldn't because the atmosphere was overall really loud. We ordered two main courses meals and they were FANTASTIC. We got so much food. Worth the money. Then we both got drinks as well and both ordered a cheesecake along with getting the babysitter a piece of cheesecake. I was expecting a $80-$100 bill but only paid $65! We pay that at Chilis in pearl ridge for just meals half this size & two drinks! So I thought that was a great deal.

Lily B.,"Mililani, HI",874,538,1986,2.0,11/20/2011,"I guess it's hit or miss with this joint... we went for dinner on Halloween (as we've been doing EVERY year with a group of friends for the last 3 years)... and although I don't mind the hour or two wait... I want my food to taste good when I get it! I USUALLY get the shrimp scampi... BUT... the last time I ate here... I ate about half of it, and then had to run to the bathroom to THROW IT UP. YES, THROW IT UP. And NO, I WASN'T pregnant. LOL. Now I can't even remember the last time I ate out in a restaurant and actually had to VOMIT in their bathroom. It's pretty damn disgusting though I must say... thank the HEAVENS I'm a nurse and I had a bunch of alcohol swabs in my purse... sniffed those in between heaving so I wouldn't faint from the bathroom smell... have I grossed you out yet? Because I haven't even gotten to the review of the food... read on if you're not gagging... We got the crab won tons to start (SUPER YUMMY)... crab meat with cream cheese filling deep fried and served with a shoyu sauce. My absolute favorite appetizer! They NEVER mess this up! Our friends got the fried mac and cheese which I took a tiny bite of (it was okay)... too heavy for me... So since you read my lovely story on how I'll never ever order my ex fave shrimp scampi... I opted to try something new. I HATE trying something new because usually I don't like it... sigh... such is life of a picky eater! Since the chicken madeira is supposedly the number one chicken dish on the menu (which is a BOOK) I opted for that paired with the steak diane... as well as garlic mashed potatoes.  Our food was out in a reasonable time... oh wait my boyfriend ordered the steak diane paired with shrimp scampi (cringe)...  His food he liked... although he ordered his steak medium rare and it came out medium WELL... after telling our waiter this he told a manager who then came by to apologize (not his fault) and state he'd get a new steak out right away... it came out fairly quickly and it was cooked perfectly (so my boyfriend says... I mean I'm all for medium... I don't like my beef as mooing as he does!) Then there's my food... so my steak diane was cooked medium and it tasted okay... nothing spectacular... but the chicken madeira was a FLAT piece of TENDER chicken which had THE FUNKIEST taste I've ever had on chicken. (((sitting here perplexed))) There was also 3 asparagus tips on top (I HATE asparagus)... which made it that much more unappealing. I gave it a bite... and well, it was BLAND, WEIRD, and I'm telling you... FUNKY is the best word to describe it. I sat there thinking how the hell this damn piece of chicken was THE most popular item on their menu?! SMH...  The garlic mash... (cough cough)... was BEYOND salty! I'm NOT a fan of salt, but this was as if they added a tablespoon of salt instead of a dash of salt... everyone at the table tried the mash and they ALL agreed it was hella salty. SIGH. The other options of starch didn't quite interest me so I played it safe with french fries to sub out.... I mean you can't get french fries wrong can you?! They came out just fine.  I was TEMPTED to send the chicken back... because it SUCKED... and it tasted FUNKY... and it looked FLAT and SAD... BUT I was so over all the food issues that I just wanted to be an 8 year old and play with my food (the chicken) as I had no interest in eating it. The waiter was conscious of me playing with it and asked how it tasted (I was honest) and he was kind enough to ask if I wanted something else but I declined... playing with the chicken kept me occupied while everyone else ate and while I waited for my dessert... FINALLY something good... fresh strawberries with the original cheesecake. Can't mess that up. And we got a red velvet cheesecake. Very dense but very delicious. And I skipped the booze and opted for a strawberry lemonade which is BOMB... so all in all... next time I might as well order my drink, won tons, and go straight to dessert! LIFE IS UNCERTAIN. Didn't I say to eat dessert first?! SMH for not following my own advice... :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=720

There's always a really big crowed of people in the waiting area which seems normal since it's a popular restaurant, but it seems like an abnormally large portion of the people crowded around that area are CF hosts. It's weird.  The good: If you have the patience to wait it out, though, the food's awesome. They have a good variety of food whether you like red meat, chicken, fish, or you want a vegan/vegetarian option. The ""Evelyn's pasta"" is awesome. I had it vegan style. The portion was large enough to fill my belly and leave me with left overs.  Finally, our waiter, Ken, was awesome. He was super accommodating to all my vegan questions.

Rebekah L.,"Honolulu, HI",16,63,141,4.0,4/8/2012,"I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before, and with both the good and bad reviews, it's difficult to ascertain whether or not it's worth a visit. But because my family decided we'd celebrate my brother's girlfriend's birthday by going to The Cheesecake Factory, I was going to be able to form my own opinion. One thing The Cheesecake Factory is known for is their slightly ridiculous wait time. If you're expecting to eat here for dinner, do expect to be waiting atleast an hour or so before being seated. Fortunately, the lunch shift is a bit more relaxed in the sense that we'd only had to wait for fifteen minutes. After being buzzed, we had to fight our way to the reception desk where we were promptly--though midly hindered by a busboy being harangued--seated. When the waiter finally arrived, he gave us a brief introduction about the place and left to give us some time to look over the menu. What I really enjoyed about their menu is that they had a great variety of different choices that would even suit the pickiest of eaters. So even though we all had our different tastes/palates, we were all able to find something to our liking. When the waiter returned, we'd asked what their most popular appetizers were. And unfortunately, I can't recall what he'd told us, but we ended up ordering their lettuce wraps and fried calamari. If you've been to P.F. Chang's before, they too, are famous for their lettuce wraps. But in my opinion, I much preferred The Cheesecake Factory's lettuce wraps. It was just well put-together and the food combinations were delicious. The fried calamari was a real treat too as their batter was very light and crispy, almost like a mix of rice and mochiko flour.  For the main course, we ordered an angel hair pasta dish with red sauce, a skinnylicious chicken dish with asparagus, tomatoes, and onions, the bang bang chicken and shrimp, and the eggs benedict with tomatoes and spinach. All of us enjoyed our dishes except for my brother who'd ordered the bang bang. It was unfortunately, without much of a ""bang."" But other than that, everything went smoothly enough. We weren't able to try any of their cheesecakes considering we had an ice cream cake waiting at home, but maybe next time. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory was worth visiting, but I'm not sure if it's a restaurant I'd return to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=720

Mildred B.,"Waimea, HI",86,6,,5.0,11/23/2015,"This restaurant, by far is my all-time favorite!!! Every time I'm on Oahu, I make sure that I come here for lunch or dinner or even just for cheesecake!  The wait is usually about 45 minutes for a table around 5ish.  I would recommend going there for lunch or an early dinner, that way you don't have to wait so long.  Still, it is so worth the wait! The menu is not your typical menu, it is a booklet.  So many things to choose from!  I recently brought my family here for the first time.  We are a family of 6 and we do have different taste; but this menu had something for everybody!!!   Customer service is on point; these people know what they're doing!  They have perfected the balance of turning tables and catering to their customer's needs.  My cell phone was dying, and our server offered to look for an outlet where I could plug my phone.  She found one near our table where I could keep an eye on it, and in the meantime, she kept checking often because she didn't want it to go missing.  We had a late lunch there, and I guess our server was just about done for the day...she briefed the next server on us, letting her know that we were enjoying our entrees and would be ordering dessert.  She then introduced us to her and went from there.  Nice, smooth transition!  Especially for a constantly busy restaurant.  These workers really know how to keep their composure under all that pressure! I was on Oahu for radiation treatment so once I was released from the hospital, I made sure to go there and order food.  I was kept on a very strict no salt/dairy/gluten diet so I ordered the sweet potato fries and guacamole, which they could prepare for me unsalted.   The choices for cheesecake are endless; I have tried the Reese's peanut butter cup, strawberry, banana cream pie, banana split, oreo and pumpkin cheesecakes.  Every single one is amazing, but my all-time favorite would definitely be the Red Velvet Cheesecake.  It is their best seller...if you haven't tried it, please do and have one for me while you're at it!!! My last experience there, I had ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake along with the other food mentioned above and had walked back to my hotel room which was 10 minutes away only to find that my cheesecake was forgotten.  I was a bit disappointed, but the woman who was working the cheesecake station was extremely busy and their were so many people just waiting in that area for their table, plus she had about 6 more people in her line.  I had chosen to wait outside since it was so congested in there, and I should've checked my package when I had received it.  When I had called, the young woman who answered the phone apologized profusely and forwarded me to a manager, who again, apologized profusely.  I did not want the woman who took my order to get into trouble so I explained how busy she was.  Nonetheless, I was advised to go back and pick up my cheesecake.  When I got there, they apologized again and gave me what I had initially ordered, plus an extra strawberry cheesecake!  Worth having to walk their twice!!!   Anyway, if you're ever on Oahu, please go check them out!  We had an amazing family experience and will definitely be back again and again!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=720

First off our host asked if we wanted English menus.....yeah just cuz we're Japanese don't ask those kinds of questions if we're speaking to you in CLEAR English. Waitress was the best part of the night. She was on it with everything. I ordered the Chicken Marsala with mushrooms......not what I expected so I wasn't very satisfied.

I'm not a big cheesecake fan & I said why not try something like the Reece's peanut butter cup cheesecake, can't go wrong with peanut butter cups.....not realizing that they had 2 different peanut utter cheesecake I read the menu again.....Adams peanut butter fudge cheesecake will not disappoint a non cheesecake fan.

Harriet O.,"Fresno, CA",2,12,3,3.0,7/21/2014,"Food was consistent with the rest of the chain. We had a large party and the manager immediately introduced himself and gave us our seating options. We were sat quickly and in a beautiful area of the restaurant, near the fountain in the back with a garden view. Service (server) was great and gave us insider tips about visiting Oahu which was nice.  What the manager didn't know was that my dad is a veteran and was meeting his military buddy that he had not seen since the 1960's. It was an important night. Like I said, service was great (our main server), they were busy...drinks (not necessarily brought by server) were quite slow, but other than that - good.  However - the manager, initially friendly, was overheard by a member of our party (as they were heading to the restroom near the host station), ""They've been here for 2 hours, hopefully they'll be leaving soon."" After this was said, he walked to our table and took our silverware and napkins away, stating, ""Just helping clean up here!"" Then came back a few minutes later to stand against the wall near our table (about 6-8 ft. away) and stared at us, until we basically felt pressured to leave. The funny thing was, a lot of that time was spent waiting for drinks, salads, dinner and dessert. We weren't there long after the service was complete. Everyone in our party was trying not to rush my dad and his friend's reunion. Maybe I should have said something to the manager, I know he was just doing his job... It was a little disconcerting, it seemed that the focus was on numbers and not customer service.

Kelly G.,"Santa Clara, CA",318,1356,191,4.0,9/18/2011,"I just rolled home from the Cheesecake Factory. Yes.....rolled.....because there was just SO much food in each portion! Prices are a little high, but we came home with enough leftovers for another 2 meals. Bargain if you ask me.  Parking is validated at the Royal Hawaii Hotel, 1st hour is free and $1 per hour for another 3 hours.  On a Sunday morning, 11am, we were seated relatively quick. Service was kind of slow after that. Our waiter offered bread, which we accepted but it came out after our appetizer reached our table.  The menu is extensive, and I mean longer than an OCD making a list of things to do. They have 2 pages of appetizers, just as many for their specialties, pizzas, burgers, pastas, steaks, mexican, seafood, salad and of course drinks and dessert -  you name it they probably got it.  Drink wise, I splurge and order their Peach Bellini ($9.50) Expensive, but heck, how often do I actually make it out to Cheescake Factory? Apparently only once every 1.5 years. So... For appetizers though, I always enjoy their Avocado Eggroll. Its delightfully fatty from the avocado, yet light and with a nice plum sauce. Today we ordered their spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips. Heavy on the cheese and cream, lots of big chunks of artichoke in the dip.  Came with a side of sour cream and salsa. The salsa was yum, quite possibly more yum than the dip itself.  For entries, I typically get a salad. My bffs love their jambalaya. Today I ordered their lunch sized chicken piccata with angel hair pasta. Slight sour edge but creamy and yum! The bf got a mac & cheese burger. The patty itself was a nice medium, pink but not bloody, tender and flavorful.  We ended with a Tuxedo Cheesecake - chocolate chocolate and then a layer of vanilla marscapone to help cut the richness of the chocolate counterparts. The whipped cream is nice and I could eat that all day instead.  Total for the Peach bellini, a cold apple cider, spinach and artichoke dip, lunch sized chicken piccata, a mac & cheese burger and a tuxedo cheesecake came out to around $60.

I dared test Cheesecake Factory's uniformity of product by ordering their Chicken and Biscuits in Waikiki to compare it to the Chicken and Biscuits I tried many moons ago at Cheesecake Factory in Baltimore's Inner Harbor.  My official report: Both Baltimore's Inner Harbor locale and Waikiki's locale serve their Chicken and Biscuits with bite for bite exacting uniformity. Mission accomplished.  Both locales - then & now - served it listless, pasty, and bland. Baltimore wasn't a fluke. This is the standard. No bang for my buck in this dish.  My Specialty Drinks were enjoyable. Strong. Tasty. Nicely garnished. Presented well. Mixed with love. Yes. I'd say the new bartender's coming along swimmingly. My Spinach and Cheese Dip appetizer with it's hot, gooey goodness and crisp tortilla chips was nice.  And I compliment this Cheesecake Factory's vibrant vibe and upbeat atmosphere.  So, come on down. Do a decadent dessert. Have a Specialty Drink or four. Carouse with their namesake cheesecakes.

Brooke O.,"Honolulu, HI",0,32,,3.0,7/9/2015,"I've never been to this place, not until my niece took me a few weeks ago. Now I can say I've been twice.  The first time I went it was so packed with a long, very long line outside, it reminded me of waiting to get into a concert...it was ridiculous. As I waited for my niece to arrive I could hear people talking about the wait being at least two hours. I'm thinking it's 8p.m, by the time we sit down it will be 10p! I ain't down for supper, I want dinner. My niece is late - YAY!!  Here she comes, 830p. and it's like a movie star entering the crowd where everyone stands back to get a good look. My niece is beautiful. I tell her, ""we won't get a seat until midnight!"", she says, ""don't worry aunty, our table is ready."" She takes my hand and we walk past everyone to the very front and this lovely girl ask my niece how many, she says two and we get seated by the window...just like that. This seems to be her life tho, never waiting, always getting serviced right away.  The place is LOUD, did I say, ""LOUD!"". You can't hardly hear each other above it all and the tables are so close together we could reach over and eat from the other peoples plates. I thought about doing just that because everything looked sooo delicious. The menu is outrageous, overwhelming and kinda stupid. Why would anyone need so many choices? It's like 12 pages and maybe more and reading it is like reading a bedtime book. In the meantime the waiter keeps asking if we're ready like every five minutes when we're still on page one. It's super loud, people breathing on us from every angle, the place is dark, a menu like a long drawn out never ending book and a very large woman coughing like crazy with no effort whatsoever to cover her nasty germs flying out of her mouth...this first experience isn't really a good one thus far.  I decide on biscuits and gravy w/fried chicken, only because it's the only thing I've really ever heard people talk about and it always sounds so ono. Guess what?? Yeap, they are ""OUT"" of it, ha! So I order the fried chicken sliders w/a side of french fries and a side of mash potatoes...I don't know why, but yea, I ordered a side of mash and a hot mocha coffee. My niece orders some kind of raw fish plate. I don't do raw meats. She also orders a dip, I'm sorry, I cannot recall which one, but it was good. After dinner I order Linda's Fudge Cake and it was excellent! My entire dinner was very good, I really enjoyed it. I took home for my husband the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich which he also enjoyed even though he didn't eat it until the next evening. I especially enjoyed the molasses bread and took some of that home too, but for my dinner the next evening, hehe. As far a my nieces food, I can't really say if she liked it as she hardly likes any food and rarely ever touches it.  Would I go back? My first experience was an adventure indeed. I don't like loud places, especially while I'm out to dinner, nor do I like people right up on me, but the food was good and I love hanging out with my niece...so if she wanted to go again, yes, I'd venture out at least once more.

She is truly a gem! Made my birthday even more of a great day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=740
Andrea R.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",231,25,18,5.0,8/26/2015,Great atmosphere.. Relaxing and yet still hip. One of the best cheesecake factories I've been to which surprised me because I was expecting an ultra touristy one. Bartender was attentive almost to a fault (which is a good thing imho).

Jonathan P.,"Honolulu, HI",433,147,818,3.0,9/10/2011,"Okay I'm going to be honest with you...I'm not a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I have to admit the semi-upscale chain restaurant is pretty nice, but the menu is just insane. The menu is pretty much on steroids, literally! There's just way too much choices to choose from, but hey locals and tourists alike love to have LOTS of variety. I've been to the Cheesecake factory multiple times but this past Wednesday was just ridiculous. I went with a party of 15 people (normally my party would be a table of 2)...yes I know it was partially our fault but it was crazy! We pretty much waited a little over an hour to be seated and another half an hour for our food to come out. Because of the super-sized menu, I always order something different. This time I tried the California Cheesesteak   for $12.95. The cheesesteak was flavorful and the bread/fries were hot, but what really irked me was the fact that half my cheesesteak wasn't even in my sandwich! Look at my pic! Half of it was on my plate! I was pretty salty but what made my mood lighten up was seeing my friend trying to eat her soft shell tacos  . As she tried to pick up a taco it just broke, leaving her with a taco shell that looked like a donut! The then had the same thing happen with her remaining 3 tacos forcing her to eat her tacos with a fork. What redeemed them was their delicious (semi-expensive) cheesecake. For about $8 you can get a slice of one of the many different cheesecakes they carry. The two cheesecakes I got to try was the fresh strawberry cheesecake  , and the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake. The fresh strawberry cheesecake was good but come on, its just cheesecake with strawberries and strawberry sauce. The tuxedo cream however was pretty amazing! If you love chocolate, this hits the spot! There's a layer of chocolate, a layer of cheesecake, and a layer of chocolate cake. Making the perfect proportion for cake, cheesecake, and chocolate in a single bite.  Two and half hours and about 5,000 calories later I still don't really like the Cheesecake factory. I haven't been here since last Halloween and who knows maybe I won't be back till next year. If you're up for an hour+ wait by all means hit up the Cheesecake Factory. Just be prepared for a super LONG WAIT, the BIG menu (hard for indecisive folks like myself), and big portions of so-so food. But if you just want good cheesecake just get your cheesecake to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=740

Karen D.,"Puyallup, WA",839,365,1354,4.0,9/22/2011,"I've been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory from way back. No matter what location I've eaten at, the food and of course, the desserts, are always great! Eating here is an adventure. First, you have to be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait. We've experienced wait times varying from 45-90 minutes. Needless to say, we try to come during off-peak times, but even then the restaurant is completely full. Despite the constant crowds, we've always experienced excellent service here, which is saying something. Cheesecake Factory restaurants look the same no matter where you are. They're upscale casual and gaudy. The noise level of the Waikiki location depends a lot on where you're seated and when you dine since they have live music in the lanai/bar area on weekend evenings. (The music is amplified, so the volume is to the point that you can't talk over it.) Basically, you have ""very loud"" and ""over the top loud."" My favorite place to sit is the back room, which opens out onto the Royal Hawaiian Hotel terrace. The winner here is food and service. Everything I've tried from the menu (and I've tried many things) has been good. Portion sizes are huge, so I always take home leftovers. Ditto for the desserts, which are definitely big enough to share. Since you're essentially getting two meals in terms of portion size, it is reflected in the price--The Cheesecake Factory isn't cheap. The Cheesecake Factory is located in the Royal Hawaiian Center, Building C, ground floor. Park in the on-site garage and have them validate. When parking, be sure to pull into the ""guest"" parking and not the hotel parking! They are open for lunch and dinner every day plus Sunday brunch. Hours are Mon-Thu 11am-11:30pm; Fri-Sat 11am-12am; Sun 10am-11pm. Yelp 365 Challenge #54",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=740
Tamra P.,"Honolulu, HI",824,552,1,4.0,10/10/2011,"I probably like this place even more because it seems like it is impossible to get seated right away, and it's in Waikiki so I don't come here often.  Oh the irony! Wait this time wasn't too long - 10 or 15 minutes. They removed the calorie counts on the cheesecakes in the glass counter up front - hallelujah!  The last thing I want to see is that dessert alone could run you 1200 calories!  Apparently someone realized ""ignorance is bliss"".  Their cheesecakes are amazing, though.   Yes, it's a chain however their service has always been attentive, professional, and friendly when I've been here.  On my most recent visit with Emi H. they were very child friendly - even brought out a cut up banana with the bread so we could keep Isabel happy.  The portions are monster sized, so we shared a thai pasta (regular, not lunch sized) and still had leftovers.  The table bread is delicious.   Bathrooms are also clean and very nice.  They do validate parking in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, so it really is a viable option for lunch and not quite the hassle I often perceive it to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=740

What if she had celiacs disease?! She would be in the hospital right now. She's in so much pain and so uncomfortable we had to go home instead of celebrating our friends birthday. I can't believe that such a well known restaurant would let this slip. This is so outrageous!

One piece is honestly good for two to three people. The entree was soso. We both got the Diane and Salmon. The potatoes and broccoli were done well, as was the steak (though over-cooked).

Lei N.,"Aiea, HI",360,416,142,3.0,9/19/2013,"For our last meal together and after Jeremy looked through my bookmarks we ate here. We parked at the Royal Hawaiian Center and walked from that end to the other. It already looked busy walking in but they hostess at the front said the wait would be about 10 minutes which it was. Not much sitting room while you wait so we stood on the side and looked through their menus since it was my first time and I wanted to know what they had. Of course I picked up the Korean version. Once our buzzer went off, we headed to the front and waited for someone to escort us to our seats. I would have preferred a table outdoors where it would be warmer, but later on during our meal someone got attacked by a bird! Anyways, our waitress was a bit awkward. She offered us bread. They have the same bread at Cattle Company, so we enjoyed that. The other one, not so much, though the inside was soft and fluffy. I decided on the mushroom burger, no onions ( ).There was another burger that had mushrooms, but this one had cheese! Good thing we had bread to munch on because it took a while for our dishes to come. The elderly coupe besides us talked to us once in a while.  They were friendly, we hoped we gave the same impression in return. I had to cut my burger in half so I could eat it without it getting messy. I wasn't provided a knife so I borrowed Jeremy's. It still was difficult to eat anyway and I didn't even finish it. Their fries were good, still hot when it got out to us. Originally we were going to have separate cheesecakes but after thinking it through we decided to share one. We ordered the Reese's pieces chocolate cheesecake ( ). It's actually two cheesecakes together. It was alright. I didn't enjoy the nuts and after a couple of bites I was already tired of it, so was Jeremy. That's not something I would order again, even if I shared with someone. Sometimes to get our waitress' attention, he'd raise his hand. Ha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=740

samantha e.,"Honolulu, HI",1,8,3,3.0,4/30/2014,"Today I had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory on Oahu for the first time. I was so excited because I heard so many great things about it and I was going to be able to experience it first hand, well it wasn't what I was expecting. I went with my nieces Sammy and Hue and my nephew Tristin. Sammy and Hua have been to the Restaurant before and just loved it. Sammy had the Chicken Madeira Hua and I we...nt with the Fettuccini Alfredo and Tristin had a plain charbroiled Hamburger. Sammy and Tristin's food was great Hua and I not so great. The Alfredo was extremely salty we just could not eat it so we sent it back. We got two new orders a little bit better but still to salty Hua sent hers back I decide to try and eat mine and asked for more bread to help cover the saltiness. Bread, water, even bear could not cover the saltiness. The reason I am writing this is because even though my first experience was not very good I am willing to give it one more try because of how we were treated. When we sent back the first order Wayne (sorry did not get last name) came to our table and apologized and explained what they though might have been the problem and reassured us a new order would be out shortly. Wayne was apologetic, he empathized and really showed that they care about there customers. He offered to bring out complementary drinks or food to make up for the problem. The second time he came out to talk to us again nothing but professionalism. That is the reason I will give it another try I really believe that statements made that it is the bomb is true and this was just a fluke. One comment maybe Wayne should spend some time with the waitress Tammie she needs a little help in being more attentive to her customer even if it is an 8 year old. she was good at letting wayne know about what happened with the food we sent back, but that was about it!! she would ask a question but we never finished asking while she just walked away from us. I watched as she helped other customers and i did not see her treating them this way, she looked like she was conversating with other customers but just very vauge with us, maybe because we were ""locals"" i dont know what her problem was, but she really needs to treat customers the way she would want to be treated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=800

Vivian L.,"Seattle, WA",306,116,154,3.0,4/18/2013,"To be completely honest, sometimes I do wish The Cheesecake Factory was JUST a cheesecake factory. Their cheesecake selection? Fabulous assortment! My best friend put ""Trying all The Cheesecake Factory cheesecake"" on her bucket list. It's been over two years and she still has a looooong way to go. I've been here for lunches and dinners, and each time the wait is pretty long. They DO NOT take reservations. I make sure to get to Waikiki around 10:30 a.m. for lunch and around 5 p.m. for dinners.  Our servers are always very friendly and make sure our bread basket is full. I love the complimentary sweet oat bread. Their menu is huge, but the food doesn't particularly impress me. I've been presented with undercooked pasta before that had to be sent back. The portions are large, so if you want room for cheesecake, I suggest splitting an entrée with someone. So, moving on! Here are my recommendations: Appetizers: Skip the appetizers unless you're with a large group. Otherwise, avocado eggrolls are the way to go. Entrées:  -Four Cheese Pasta for the cheese lover (You really, really don't need that extra parmesan, honey.) -Shrimp Scampi -Seared Tuna Tataki Salad (My personal go-to entrée--featured on their Skinnylicious ""low calorie"" menu with 442 cal, assuming you get the tomatoes instead of the potatoes) Cheesecake: -Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake -Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake -Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Extra tips: -No reservations -Park at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping center and get your ticket validated (2-hour complimentary validated parking) -Kill some time by checking out the stores around the restaurant but don't wander too far or your buzzer won't catch the signal when they call you -No room for dessert afterwards?

First, I'm so glad that The Cheesecake Factory did not close down after the fire. The decor is beautiful; one would never know that there was a fire here. Second, the food is just okay. I ordered the shepard's pie, and it had too much garlic in it. For the rest of the day afterward, I could taste the garlic in my mouth. The noise level is loud, and the density of the noise level hits you when you enter the restaurant. However, the noise decibal level went down somewhat after we were seated off to the side. Based on food and noise, I would be inclined to give this place 3 stars. However, our server was EXCELLENT! She kept checking on us to make sure that we were okay; and she promptly showed up out of nowhere whenever we needed something (e.g., drink refills, etc.). And of course, the cheesecake for dessert is absolutely fantastic! I always choose the strawberry cheesecake; it's a classic and guaranteed pleaser. The women's bathroom is a bit dark and feels creepy. It would be nicer if there were more lighting in there.

Kiichi R.,"Waipahu, HI",190,154,114,4.0,8/2/2013,"Despite always having some sort of wait (ranging from 10 minute to 1+ hours), it is well worth it. Having been here roughly a dozen times, the service has generally been great. This means that they were friendly and capable of answering questions. Food choices? TOO MANY! Come in at lunch time for sizeable portions for a bit less. And trust me, you'll still get your fill, considering you'll be eating that mandatory dessert right? On top of the listed choices, meals such as the salmon have different flavoring! And they're very accommodating if you're allergic or wanting that extra sauce.  Now onto the cheesecakes - my suggestions: For those that want a light, but neutral flavor cheesecake that goes well even when you're full - the vanilla bean cheesecake. In fact, I would have to put it in my top 3 cheesecakes because it's delicious and very satisfying. If you want something fruity and familiar, my absolute favorite - dutch apple streusel cheesecake. My favorite because I love dutch apple pie and it's not overly sweet, despite having caramel in it. The nuts and cinnamon dutch pie crumbs help to keep the sweetness in check. A definite win. Want something sour? KEY LIME. Prepare to have your face implode. If you like sour, but not painful sour, the mango key lime pie is a better choice. Chocolate lover? The Godiva or new Oreo cheesecake is very delicious. Random dessert? I suggest the Chocolate Truffle Tower Cake. Not a cheesecake but enormous and very flavorful.  It does not receive a full 5-stars because it is exclusively in Waikiki and locals, such as myself, must travel from the other side of the island to enjoy the delicacies that is heaven.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=800

Zar A.,"Honolulu, HI",815,382,939,4.0,1/10/2011,"BUSY, BUSY, BUSY location. My secret to getting a table here is to come about 15-30 minutes before they open at 11AM. Then, you are guaranteed seating. I don't like waiting, so I have never come at dinner time. I heard that they get craaaaazzzzzyyyyyy busy... My favorite items: +Hawaiian luau salad - salad made w/ a Hawaiian twist! Besides lettuce, the salad is a three layer wonton chip salad (generous portion, easy fills two to four people) and kalua pork! yummmm! The salad dressing is a little on the strong side, but pretty yummy! +Energy breakfast - comes with egg whites, grilled chicken and some spinach and grilled tomatoes. +Snickers cheesecake - I'm weak for nuts...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=840

Ryan T.,"Honolulu, HI",110,90,589,4.0,4/11/2011,"Even with the long waits and the crowded, touristy atmosphere. The food and service make up for it once you are seated.  Pros: -Everything I've had taste good and the Steak Diane will keep me coming back  when I need my red meat fix.  -Food comes fast -Good service -My father swears he had the best soup he's ever had there.  Cons: -Long wait after 6 -No cheap parking in site -Loud  -No intimate seating, better for groups than a date.  Tips: Sometimes you can speed up the process if you find a table in the bar, I think most if not all seats are first come, first serve.

Michael J.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,86,,4.0,4/1/2013,"The thing to keep in mind if you decide to eat here, is that this place is constantly busy.  I came here for a late lunch one day, a Saturday, and they were packed.   Now, I believe there are mainly two types of customers in this world: pampered, spoiled, demanding, condescending types, and those who are willing to give the help the benefit of the doubt until they actually screw up.  I think I fall into the latter category.   So, the quality of the service here was great considering that my waitress was incredibly busy.  You may actually have to wait for a refill of water, and you may not have your meat cooked to a level perfectly suited to your palate.  Guess what?  You are still in Waikiki eating at a quality restaurant with hard working waiters and waitresses who have to deal with whiny tourists day after day after ever loving day.  If there is one thing I learned after eating here, it is that restaurant staff are an under-appreciated crowd. Now, off my soapbox.  The food was delicious.  I had a shepherd's pie and a couple brews.  It hit the spot, and I highly recommend this dish if you decide to eat here.  Your seating choices are fantastic: you can either sit in their outdoor area on Kalakaua, or have a relaxing meal inside the restaurant.  I enjoyed the dining experience, had a terrific, hard-working waitress, and all of it was for a very reasonable price considering the location. I didn't get to see ""Penny"" from Big Bang Theory (haha) but I still had a good time and will go back here if I'm ever hungry again in Waikiki.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=840

Spacious - I think I heard a live musician somewhere, or was it the music? Of the 2 I've been to in Seattle during the night, this place is perhaps slightly-y-y-y more dim. Chad, the bartender, was very smooth and on tempered rails as I watched him make various drinks over the course of the night; he's also very laidback & chill. I went for ze incredible grilled eggplant sandwich (overstatement?) and it was very nice---messy---but nice! Good stuff, along with the subbed sweet potato fries. One thing I forgot the CCF has is complimentary bread! Ohh, I especially love the dark bread. The Kentucky Tea drink came out in a slendered out glass and had a subtle buzz. All was darn good to me.

Hideyo K.,"Camp Pendleton North, CA",176,118,91,4.0,4/20/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory hardly needs any introduction. This one is located in the busiest part of Waikiki and is huge. Despite its capacity though, it's always packed with people especially at dinner time, and on weekends the line can extend outside with a waiting period of up to two hours. I always took issue with their no-reservations policy, but despite this and the often lengthly waiting period, I do enjoy sitting down for a meal here. If you're the impatient type, at least you can phone in an order and pick it up within twenty minutes even when it's busy, which I imagine would be a useful factoid for tourists staying in Waikiki. The menu is the most extensive I've ever seen at any restaurant (I don't know how the servers manage) and is one of the reasons why this place is one of my favorite major chains. I made it my goal to try everything on their menu, but thank goodness I'm over that phase. By now, I've tried about a quarter of the food on their menu, which really is enough. For lunch, I do enjoy their Grilled Salmon. The dinner portion is kind of pricy, but the lunch portion turned out to be more than enough to get full with. I usually order it ""Simply Grilled"" with broccoli and brown rice, but you can also get a Miso-flavored and a Crusted Filet version, neither of which are particularly that good here. I think simply grilled is the way to go if you genuinely like salmon or fish in general. I've also enjoyed their Shepherd's Pie on more than one occasion since it offers a generous portion of ingredients with spectacularly tasting sauce, beef mince, and mashed potato. Hardly a complicated dish, which makes it a safe bet when you're looking for quantity (the dinner portion, though I eat it by myself, can definitely be shared by two). Most of the pasta and pizza is pretty good, too. I also enjoy their Pineapple Mojito's every now and then even though it's often mixed differently, but then The Cheesecake Factory is nothing if not for their desserts. There are a couple sundaes and smoothies on the menu, but if you're ever here, you MUST try their cheesecake. Fresh Strawberry is the simplest and safest thing you can get, but I'm a chocolate lover. I NEED my chocolate. Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake is pretty awesome and is most appropriate around Halloween time. You can also get a good chocolate fix with their 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake without compromising on your addiction to plain old cheesecake too, since this one has distinct layers of both in it, along with a hefty load of chocolate icing. But alas, the one chocolate cheesecake that satisfies me completely is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. It's the best, and the flavor is so rich, even I have to eat a slice in increments over the course of a week. Decisions, decisions, decisions. . .  As it is so easy to become overwhelmed by their colossal dining and dessert menu, I truly recommend previewing their menu online or taking with you a take-out menu before sitting down for a meal. After a long wait gripping that eternal buzzer, you wouldn't want to add to your waiting time by waltzing in without a plan, after all. . .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=840

The  menu is so extensive that it's almost frustrating to try to pick what to eat!  We had two appetizers for the table - avocado spring rolls and crab rangoons.  Both were tasty, but the avocado spring rolls were amazingly good, packed with avocados with a cilantro sauce that really brought out the flavors.  I ordered a passion fruit mojito that was a little weak, but delicious (like minty juice). I also had the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, which was very tasty.  BF ordered the white chicken chili, which had white beans and a Southwestern-style, sour creamy flavor with a little kick.  Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food as well.  Service was not lightning fast, but if you consider that we had 8 people, and the restaurant is enormous, it was very reasonable.

The huge menu. The ridiculous variety of cheesecake. Consistently good food. The prices. lol Our meal this time consisted of a turkey burger and bacon cheeseburger. Both were AMAZING. What wasn't amazing? The WAIT. It sucked. We waited for over an hour to eat. I know its Waikiki and trust me, as I just completed over 10 reviews today, I chalk it up as me being in Hawaii and how the prices are more expensive because of Hawaii. There was a little annoying condensation from the ac units dripping on his from the ceiling. It wasn't too bad, but it was there. Customer service was great and our server was very attentive to us. Would we come back? Yes. Why? Because it's freakin Cheesecake Factory! If we needed to eat because our life depended on it? No. The wait is crazy and there are probably tons of places to go eat.

Im sure pf changs and ruths chris is good too as usual, but as far as other local spots, prepare to be disappointed and pay out the nose. If you want to avoid an hour to hour and a half wait, get there early, like around 5pm. The line was a mile long when we left. Wait had to have been over 2 hours. Anyhow, service hasnt blown me away anywhere in waikiki, but the food is awesome here... And for the price, it cant be beat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=780
Kevin N.,"Honolulu, HI",12,38,35,4.0,2/25/2014,"I came here once with a party of 10.  Be sure to go in and make a reservation.  I don't think they accept reservations off the phone.  They are always packed.  Expect to wait an hour for a table.  Honestly, the whole meal took an hour so I see why the wait is so long.   So our party was split up into 5 and 5.  Two separate tables.  For my table, we ended up ordering all of the appetizers.  That alone was enough to fill up five people, maybe more, since we were ""the guy"" table.  All of the appetizers were terrific, I would give it 4/5 stars.   The Cheesecake was delicious! I mean, it is their specialty!  I ordered the Oreo Cheesecake, and the Godiva Cheesecake.  I recommend getting the Oreo Cheesecake.  The Godiva Cheesecake is only recommended for people who love double chocolate.   Cheesecakes: 5/5 for taste 5/5 for presentation",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=780
Gabriel T.,"Aiea, HI",458,995,1262,3.0,10/6/2014,"Aight so coming here recently just reminded me why I don't come here often.  I feel that the only thing that makes the whole thing worth the trip, time, and dine is da damn cheesecake for real.  Aight so I came here recently for my friend's birthday celebration dinner along with other friends and mutual friends.  Since they don't do reservations, we came here early on a Saturday night to put in our name.  We put in our name a little before 5PM and didn't get seated till like about 6:30PM.  That is going to give you an idea of how long the wait is going to be especially on a Saturday night in Waikiki.  Also our party was about 14 or so strong so not sure if they played a factor into it but I think it probably did.  In regards to the waiting game, the Cheesecake Factory could at least serve and provide free Wifi because you know everyone will be on their phones while waiting and stuff.  My friends and I tried looking it up but no luck.  When we came in, we got sat all the way near the back area past the kitchens and nearby the second bar area.  Our waitress was nice and accommodating of us for a large party.  It was about 2 hours to 2.5 hours in before we got some food in our stomachs.  I ordered the blueberry mojito which was pretty good.  It's very blueberry and sweet.  For my dinner meal, I got Elena's favorite pasta (upon request) which was ok.  I was kinda dry but it was aight I guess.  What made everything worth it was the cheesecake for dessert! I got the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake which is my all time favorite.  I really goes well with the blueberry mojito I must say.  Our whole time spent there was about 4 hours total.  We got out right around 9:30PM.  Some side notes, in regards to location, you can't really miss Cheesecake Factory, there will always be people waiting around the restaurant and it's within the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Plaza area.  They really have the ambiance set low when dining in especially at night, you will need a flashlight to browse through the menu.  I don't like how they don't have prices listed specifically for certain things like the individual cocktails and cheesecakes.  Coming into here reminds me of Liliha Bakery, you also have to wait and there's always a crowd for cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=780

Shallow them up and spit them out. My meal was not fully cooked and my wife's was smothered in cream it killed any flavour.

I'm all for mood lighting, but when I can't really see my food...uuuhh maybe the setting is set too low.  Love the long island ice teas! Love the pumpkin cheesecake (only seasonal) and without the extra cream on top. I find that a little greasy. Otherwise, great place to go if you're in Waiks.

Yes, the wait can be a major pain in the rear, BUT the food is actually good. I've never had a bad experience here except for once when i think the jalapeno's had gone bad and well, you know the rest of the story.  I last came here with a party of 30 at 4:30 and the wait was only an hour long but, had to wait an extra hour because they gave the table away due to the fact that my party hadn't arrived. But I must say that they tried their best and I know was frustrated with my group.  anyways, the pasta's are always cooked and seasoned well and I never have a problem with them like other chain restaurants that specialize in pasta which i shall not name.

Beth I.,"Honolulu, HI",417,348,767,5.0,5/16/2011,"This particular Friday night really was as good as it gets for dining out in Waikiki.  It was about 930ish and there is always a wait time, but it was only suggested to be 15min.  It was my chance to check out Forever 21 next door (which is gigantic BTW).  5 minutes into my adventure in clothes heaven, our buzzer went off.  We were surprised that it was sooner than we expected! I was actually a little disappointed that I didn't have more time to look around!  My wallet stayed happy though. We were escorted by a very friendly greeter and led to our table on the diamond head end of the restuarant where there is live music.  Sounds obvious that a greeter should ""greet"" you, but some restaurants have the worst seater/greeters. Not so at CF. Smiles all around and small talk as they seat you.  We had a prime spot to view the entertainersat our table.  They are top notch and I'm convinced I'd like them to play at my wedding someday.  Very mellow classic Hawaiian and popular songs and not overpowering the conversation. Our server came along and told us the specials and brought us our drinks (pineapple mojito and ultimate margarita) and warm bread.  My favorite is the rye bread and I could sit there noshing on it all night.  So delicious. We ordered the ahi carppaccio which was by far the best I've ever had.  I really appreciate all the innovation that CF puts into their dishes.  They have quite a few traditional dishes, however, the presentation and flavor is a cut above. We were oohing and ahhing over the food that was ordered by other tables.  Gorgeous! The carppaccio looked nothing like we are used to and that was a VERY good thing.  It was two thinly sliced pieces of fresh ahi the size of the whole plate.  It was drizzled with the spicy mayo and aioli, green onions, avocado and pureed jalapeno and served with a ponzu dipping sauce and namasu on the side.  It was fabulous.  (see the pic posted) We also ordered one entree of the mac nut crusted ono with stir fried veggies.  The two generous pieces of fish were very moist and tender and served with a delicious sauce (can't remember if it was white wine or something else).  It was about $24, but worth every bite and should be shared by two if you are ordering apps. The part that really sealed this million dollar deal was the service.  It was friendly, efficient, and professional.  I was also very impressed at the way the servers work so well together to make their work even more efficient.  Some restaurants have servers that don't look like they even know eachother, but at CF, they even help to bring out the food and clear tables for eachother.  They have got efficiency down to a science.  Everyone seems to be working toward the same goal... happy customers. CF was a total two thumbs up experience.  I'm so glad we didn't go to our usual haunts and ventured out to waikiki for late night bites.  I can't wait to go back and this time I'll save room (like not eat for a whole day) to have cheesecake. P.S. This isn't the cheapest place to eat if you're on a budget.  It came out to just below $100 for 4 (alcoholic) drinks the fish entree, and the carppaccio appetizer.  The drinks are where they get you.  They don't have prices on the menu and it will cost you between $10-14 each.  BUT, the entrees are large and can be shared if you order a salad or apps and I'm completely all for paying a bit more to get top notch service, food quality and entertainment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=780

We went for dinner and timed it perfectly, pretty much only waited about 5 minutes then as we sat there I could see the line getting longer and longer and longer. Crazy.   We started our meal with the ahi poke...now that was good but expensive.  It came layered with fried won ton pi and the sauce was really tasty, the perfect amount of kick to it.  It had a small tossed salad on the side which was great because the poke was maybe only a 1/4 pound serving.  Too little for the price (around $15) and waaay too little for 3 people. I would have just ordered another poke for myself if it wasn't so expensive. Price not listed on the menu which means if you gotta ask how much you prolly can't afford it.  LOL Anyways, I opted for the chopped salad entree which would have been perfect had it not been for pieces of corn....yuck.  I like corn but I think it should be popped, or stay on the cob, not put in a tossed green salad.  So I actually sat there and picked it out. Others in my party had a rib eye steak which was pretty good sized and tasted ok.  The other entree that was ordered was Chicken Bellagio which was a pasta dish with a  bunch of cilantro on top.  Ok if you like it. We also had drinks which may be why our bill was high, the cocktail menu also don't have prices on it....remember: if you gotta ask how much...... I would totally recommend the cheesecakes pricey but huge and tasty.  I would go back only for cheesecake so at least they have a side counter for that so no need to wait in that loooong ass line.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=780

The important thing I learned about this whole experience is to avoid this waitress , Tammy only work for tips , and the bad thing about this waitress , after the manager confronted her, she turn around and lied and told the manager we are bad customers .

They don't take reservations or call aheads. It was first come first serve only.  When we arrived, the line was well outside the door.  After 20 minutes in line we discovered there were actually two lines.  The first was to put in your name and the second was to get a beeper.   We were told it would be a 1 hour 7 minute  wait.  I checked in after 1 hour and 20 minutes, to find why we hadn't heard from them.  I was told they were ""running a little behind"", and that it would be another 25 minutes.   I checked in after another 40 minutes to ask  why we still hadn't heard from them.  I'm not sure that they didn't know that it would be in excess of a 2 hour wait but just gave customers those ""estimates"" knowing that after someone had already invested more  than 1.5 hours, they would stick around for ""another 25 minutes"". They finally seated us  without the beeper ever going off.  We had to wait quite a while for our server.  We waited even longer for our appetizers. The salads and avocado rolls were fresh and perfectly prepared.   We waited far far too too long for our main course.  When it arrived, two of the meals were acceptable, a third one had a steak that was hot but the salmon was barely over room temperature.  My Macadamia Ono had obviously been sitting in the window for quite a while as the fish was only slightly warm, under seasoned and a little dried out.  My brown rice had no warm to it at all.  The vegetables were perfectly cooked but near cold like the fish and rice.  I finally gave up and told them to just bag it and I'd reheat and doctor it at home.   We next ordered desert.  All they would have to do is cut it and serve right?  How wrong could that go?  When the server checked back with us, he had a distressed look on his face when he realized that after nearly 15 minutes that course not been delivered in anything close to a timely manner either.   The Red Velvet Cheesecake was really good.  I think the reason it took so long to deliver this course to the table is that they must have run out of desert plates. The cheesecake was chilled as it should be, but the dishes were hot.  I'm guessing fresh out of the dish washer. In total our dinner adventure took 4.5 hours.  The manager knocked off the charge for the appetizer and a starter salad to help defray the cost of the parking lot overtime charges.

This always-busy location doesn't take reservations, so on any given night it's at least a 45-minute wait. And nothing bothers me more than watching tourists eat here after a long wait and NOT ordering a cheesecake. Cheesecake Factory has SO many dishes to choose from, I never understand how they're able to get food out fast. This is the biggest location I've ever been to. I ate the ""Incredible Grilled Eggplant Sandwich"" with a salad which is one of the few veggie options available. Very tasty, but it kind of fell apart after a while because it was super juicy. I ended off with the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake which was perfect because I was craving chocolate and wanted something lighter without unnecessary layers of cake. They put way too much whipped cream for my taste, but the cheesecake never disappoints. I ate about 3/4 of it myself, so it would have been finished if my dining companion had helped me out. The service here gets 5 stars, but with such a massive menu I don't think their food will ever get to fine dining status.

Service: Very courteous and helpful wait staff.  They go the extra mile in keeping water levels, food quality checks, and even parking validation for you. Food: Typical fare for the chain restaurant.  Pasta portions are very generous but reflects the price.   If the dish isn't naturally heavy, the portions will definitely feed you for more than one meal.  If you like pasta and cheesecake, this is obviously the place to go but they also have other foods.  The menu has many choices and their specialty drinks are fruity and varied.

We felt like our server didnt believe we could afford our dinner, and we felt like we were being watched the whole time which is expected for good service like its good that theyre attentive, but we felt like a huge inconvenience to them and it was really hard to get past that during our dinner, but we tipped them well anyway.

Kobe O.,"Honolulu, HI",248,162,77,5.0,9/14/2013,"Man, I can never go wrong at the place. The food is good, huge portions, and the free bread is amazing and endless. The place is a little dark, noisy, and the prices seem to have gone up alot (what stands out is almost $8 for a piece of cheesecake). I think this, like many of the other mainland chain stores in Hawaii, is the #1 sales producer in the States.  Always crowded and if you don't get there before 5pm, a guaranteed wait. Some things we like - chinese chicken salad, shepherds pie, cheesecake, salmon, angel hair pasta with shrimp, sliders. Finally tried the orange chicken (I know, just get it at Panda) and was mildly impressed.  Actually tasted better the next day for some reason. Lunch has the best deals......I would pass on the mini entrees and spend a couple dollars more for the full size.......the extra amount you get is way more than the few dollars and you have lunch or snack for later. If you also want to get a validation stamp with no questions asked.....this is the place.  So crowded and chaotic, they can't tell if your legit or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=860

Wayne, the manager, and Joni, our server, were top notch.  We had 4 adults and 4 children.  We were celebrating a 3-year old birthday.  Wayne made sure we were seated in a reasonable time, and Joni was fantastic with the kids.  Wayne made sure we had a red velvet cheesecake defrosted in time for our dinner.  And, did I say how fantastic Joni was?

Ka'ili H.,"Omaha, NE",235,381,194,5.0,9/12/2010,"what do you get when you put three best friends together ( after many moons of not hanging out), good food, good waitress, and no wait for a table????!!!  A raucous of laughter and pidgin laced story telling of the current events in our lives. Let's start with our arrival:  got to cheesecake right after work, around 4:50pm, due to anxious hunger in our tummies & excitement to see each other again.   Hosts & Hostesses were waiting patiently to seat people coming in, took us inside to a booth about 4:55pm.  Menu: tough tough decisions. go healthy? eat whatever your heart desires cuz hey you haven't seen your gals in eons?  i decide on the special: ginger crusted salmon with bok choy in some kind of ginger cream sauce, and BROWN RICE. The universe has finally blessed this place with brown rice on THE day we chose to eat here! chee hee!  One of my friends got the Kobe burger with mushrooms & sweet potato fries, my other friend ordered the club sandwich with side french fries.  We each gave a two thumbs up to our meals.  For me the exception was the sauce, it was a bit tart for my taste buds & a bit too gingery,it made me wish i ordered a good old burger, but then, I was trying to be healthy! Sweet potato fries were a WINNER! Crispy & sweet and full of yummy goodness! We just had to order dessert, cuz that's just how we do.  I ordered the Reese's cake cheesecake because they are donating 25 cents to a charity and my friend got the red velvet cheesecake, we shared amongst us.  The Reese's cheescake was really rich and whoah good.   The peanut butter made it thick & the nuts at the end were a bit of a surprise.  Overall it was nice to deviate from my favorite cheesecake, the Kahlua cocoa chocolate (coffee?) cheesecake.  It was surprising richer than the red velvet concoction.   Red velvet, you can't really go wrong with that one. Customer service:  Our waitress was on it! She knew the specials and was extremely friendly.  She was patient with us and had a great sense of humor since our dinner together brought out the sillyness in us.  Our food came out in a timely manner, and she remembered our request for straws and always smiled.  Our waitress helped make our dinner even better. And that, my friends, is what happens when you put best friends, good food, and great service together.  A winning review and amazing memories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=860

G. H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,14,9,4.0,2/16/2014,"The bad news:  Ok so we always go to Cheesecake Factory in Honolulu as we live here. Often we get ""to go"" as it is so convenient, especially because they are so busy. Why so busy? The food is outstanding. ALTHOUGH recently they are lacking... We always would order the combo platter (sauces to die for) of Steak Diane/Shrimp Scampi. We've been ordering this dish all over the country (as we are travelers) and it is outstanding. Now a change??? You see it used to be with the side of mashed potatoes you could exchange for free the fettuccine Alfredo. This goes much better with it anyway!!! NOW they charge $3.99 if you want to trade! Bad. THEN they change the steak. It used to be 3 nice medallions of steak. Tender, great cut. Now it's only a few little ""hunks"" of meat. Barely a bite for approx. $22. Sooo we are now not ordering that favorite meal anymore. CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHY???  Next the good news... kinda... we had a very bad experience with a waiter. Short, nasty, clumping the plate down, cold food -- we were told by another staff member he left the food on the line because he HAD to wait for our fettuccine Alfredo to be cooked.... so... he left his shift for the day. Lucky for us. We had to send the cold food back. Marshall Freedman the Manager came out and couldn't have been nicer. He accommodated us this one time and did not charge the surprise $3.99 charge to change to fettuccine Alfredo. JEREMY J was our new waiter. He went above and beyond and is a great asset to this facility. The ending was good. Unfortunately we won't buy our favorite combo anymore due to the above aforementioned quality and upcharge of substitute. That is sad for us.   PLEASE NOTE THE RATING I GAVE THIS IS FOR THIS MEAL ONLY. EVERYTHING ELSE (to my knowledge now that I am trying other meals like the wonderful salads!) are great.

Jessica M.,"Honolulu, HI",105,124,5,4.0,11/2/2012,"A friend of my boyfriend decided to have her birthday party here last night.  There were 27 people and they don't take reservations.  I smelled disaster.  What was very surprising was that they managed to get us in in about an hour, which was about the usual wait even with only a few people.  I thought for sure that the service would be disastrous and that the checks would take over an hour to sort out and that we would be captured there practically overnight against our wills.  Well, what was even more surprising was that everything was extremely quick and efficient.  The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and quick and they paid attention to detail. There were 27 of us, and each and every person got their correct drink, correct food, correct check, and everything was on time and quick.  I was amazed at the efficiency!  Our waitress was so nice and stayed on top of everything. The inside of the restaurant is very nice.  It's actually very beautiful if I do say so myself.  I normally don't like chains, but I was impressed. The food was good. There are a lot of choices, and of COURSE the cheesecake was to die for.   If you have a big group and you want efficiency along with your good food, choose Cheesecake factory in Waikiki.

Started with the spicy ahi tempura for our appetizer. BF loved it. I thought it was okay. I ordered the Bang bang chicken and shrimp. I remembered it being a little spicier, which I love, but this time around it was pretty mild. BF had the ribeye steak. It looked juicy, and it must have been good because I don't remember getting to taste any of it. Too full for dessert, but we can't leave without any cheesecake, so a couple of slices to go please!

The sign says you can fit something like ~560 people in here and even at 10pm the place is filled to the brim. Food is just like other Cheesecake Factories but the fish seemed more fresh than others.

Karen E.,"Honolulu, HI",84,120,139,5.0,6/14/2013,"I have no idea why it has taken me this long to write a review.  Besides Kailua I am always in Waikiki.   And what better way to spend my time here but to dine at The Cheesecake Factory!  I have been coming here way before my yelp review days and even before Forever 21 was right across from their entrance.  I think it use to be Town&Country Surf or something like that.  Oh and way before they remodeled the whole Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.  Needless to say I really love eating here.Decor is second to none.  I love how  you can dine outdoors and do some people watching or indoors to enjoy the beautiful wood trimming on the ceiling and what looks like hand painted art on the walls.  It might be just wallpaper but who cares I love the look of it.  It is usually a little dim if you dine here in the evenings but during brunch or the day it is perfect lighting.Now wait time depends on when you come here to eat.  During the day it's not so bad but the evening and especially during the weekends it is busy!  They take down your name and you are handed a pager and the usual time is 45 minute wait.  There are some benches on the side with cusions to sit on while you wait but good luck on finding one that's not already claimed.  There is also a rock wall you can sit on right across from the entrance but after awhile your butt starts to get real sore.  Then there is always Forever 21 for the ladies and guys too.  If you have read my review my other reviews my husband who is a metro type of dude has purchased serveral things from here but will not admit it to his friends.  Last if you have read up to this part of the review you  would be lucky enough to know the secret of waiting at the most 30 minutes for a table or less.  This tip is for you people that have kids 5 or 6 years and older or a small group of friends 4 or 5 tops.  Before I had my baby it was just my husband, my older daughter 7 yrs old, and myself coming in to dine.  Instead of getting a regular table we would head down to the high bar tables that are located right behind the bar counter.  There are about four or five tables with four chairs at each table and it is first come first serve basis.  So if you see an empty table grad it quick because there are sometimes others stalking for a table too.  Now if you have five people in your party hopefully you can grab one of the empty bar chairs.  They serve you drinks from the bar and the whole menu and you wait half the time for a table then having to go through the whole getting a pager and waiting FOREVER!!!  Reward for reading my review.  And if you already knew about my little secret then I'll move on to the best part the FOOD. Appetizers -Ahi Poke Salad --Deep Fried Mac&Cheese----Crazy goodness here!  You get four deep fried balls of mac&cheese over a red sauce I'm assuming it's marinara --Lettuce Wraps---I thinks it's chicken or is it pork...I forgot but this plate is huge --Nachos----Order only one plate of this.  WARNING you will not finish this so make sure you share.  Whatever you can imagine is on these nachos. Entrees --Chicken Alfredo---Cheesy saucey goodness.  Enough said. Oh and chicken --Cuban Sandwich with sweet potato Fries --Shirmp Club Sandwich with Fries--Shirmp is perfectly cooked, bacon, turkey, and whatever else goes on a regular club sandwich --I want to say Chicken Marsala but it's one of their popular plates.  I remember eating a pasta also with marsala I think it was raviloli but yes their pasta plates are great also --Hawaiian Pizza--I love ham and pineapples --Kalua Pizza--Shreaded porky goodness --Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich--Lots of flavor, Huge, very crispy, THE BEST chicken sandwich you will ever have tried --Bang Band Chicken and Shirmp--It comes with rice.  If you like Thai food this is a good choice Desserts --Cheesecake is their main dessert so here a list that I've tried and I will mention if I like it or not Oreo Cheesecake--Don't like it... Too Sweet for my taste Reese Cheesecake--Another one I don't care for too sweet Dulce De Leche--I have ordered this everytime ever since I found out that it has the perfect balance of creamy rich cheesecake and dulce yumminess Key Lime--It's a little tart but not too much Vanilla Bean--If you don't like the regular cheesecake with the sour cream this is the next best thing Banana Cream--I love this cheesecake.  It is the first cheesecake I had from here and it is light if you don't want something too rich Strawberry--It is a classic combo can't go wrong Original--Comes with sour cream topping.  I love the sour and sweet combo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=880

My husband was shocked at the size of his sandwich. Portions are definitely large enough to share. Service was a little slow, but she was very friendly and checked on us frequently.

You gotta go big and there is no other place to go big than Cheesecake in Hawaii.  Location: On the Waikiki strip. It's right next to the Apple store Staff: Extremely friendly Wait: It wasn't that long. Then again we ate around 8:30-9pm. This place is always packed and crowded. When I mean always I mean always. Supposedly, it's the busiest Cheesecake in the world and I can see why. Though, if you get lucky you won't have to wait too long. They give you a little pager and it starts flashin' Food: Good. Had the roadside sliders (Biggest sliders, I've seen at any restaurant and I'm a huge fan of sliders. I always get them wherever I go) Decent Fetticuine Alfredo. Definitely not the best but not the worst. Good size portions  Bi-lingual menus: HUGE plus.... I was extremely surprised when they actually brought out the Chinese menus. The group I was with were all Chinese nationals who couldn't read a lick of English so I was equally surprised when the waiter brought out these menus which made orderin so much better.

Next I got the chicken marsala which is always my favorite. It was sooooo freaking good. Then for my last meal, I got the French Country salad which is one of my faves. Its an appetizer, but I eat it as a meal. Its filling. It has mixed greens, goat cheese, beets, candied pecans and grilled asparagus.  Bread was good, servers seemed kinda sad, but were on point.  Great food so that makes up for everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=900
Mellisa C.,"Honolulu, HI",5,11,,2.0,8/26/2013,"I've tried this place twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. Lunch was a better experience,maybe because my expectations were not so high.  Went back for dinner with my hubby as I had raved about the lunch and we both love cheesecake! Mistake.. The wait was ridiculous! The line to even get the pager was unreal and full of rude shoving people. My food was great-cashew chicken, on the other hand my husband ordered a very expensive steak that wasn't fit to feed the dog. Both times the service was horrible and obvious we had a new waiter. Not only new to the establishment but waiting all together. Most places like this make wait staff take test on the menu and new staff generally shadows someone till they get it. Obviously not the case here! It's really too bad because the cheesecake is awesome! Since my husband buys and he was disgusted doubt ill ever have the cashew chicken again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=900
Anita C.,"Las Vegas, NV",241,251,114,3.0,3/25/2011,"Last night's original plan was to eat at Makittii (because I wanted lobster tails) but my friend was napping and took a long time to respond to my text.  When he finally responded, I was no longer in the mood to have buffet.  So I suggested Cheesecake factory for some weird reason because there's nothing there that I'm particularly craving.  So off we went to Waikiki! We parked at Royal Hawaiian Shopping center, free for 3 hours with validation, and proceeded to CF.  We got there by 8pm, was told the wait was an hour and 10 mins, put our names down and waited.  I called Yardhouse and some other places to see what their wait times were and they were all the same.  So we stayed and waited.  From my experience as a manager of many restaurants, the one thing we never did was give a shorter time than what we expected it to be, simply bcs we are guessing the wait time and if we sit ppl sooner than the given time, they will feel much happier.  But noooo, the restaurants here love bsing ppl about the wait time.  So we didn't get seated until 9:45.  By that time I was beyond starving, grumpy, cranky... just not bitchy. Our server didn't come around until 5 mins after we sat but he brought us bread when he came around, so that saved him.  We ordered, our drinks came out in a timely fashion, the runners were good and fast.   We shared the Asian Chicken Salad and the dressing was really gingerly (I'm not really into ginger - yes, I know, I'm Chinese, but alas I'm not into ginger, makes me sick if I eat chucks of it) and there was a ton of shredded green onions, I felt like I was eating more green onions than greens (was it even lettuce or napa cabbage?  I can't even tell since there hardly seem to be any ""salad"").  We had to wait another 10 minutes to flag down our server to get more dressing. I ordered the Steak Diane with the herb crusted Salmon and my friend ordered Steak Diane with the Shrimp.  I'm not sure but I felt like if we didn't share an app, I probably wouldn't have gotten full from the steak and salmon because the Steak Diane was chucks of steak instead of a whole piece, there were probably about 5 chucks - the sauce was a little sweet (I like sweeter sauces, so that suited me perfectly), I thought that the sauce for Diane's were suppose to be creamy...  Oh and the steak came out lukewarm borderline cool (wasn't going to send it back since we were HUNGRY!!)  The salmon was kind of small and the white sauce was a little bland, I had to add some salt to it.  The red potato mash covered almost half the plate!  but it was tasty and filling My friend ordered his steak medium but many pieces were med rare, I ordered mine med rare and received many med pieces, so we swapped - no biggie. I ordered Sangria and it was okay, nothing really special.  My friend ordered the Long Island Ice Tea and he said it was a little watered down.  For $10 a drink, I would hope that it'll be more than ok. We ordered cheesecake with strawberries to go. The pluses of the meal was the fresh, warm bread that they have - I love the dark one, so yummy!  I enjoy the decor and the lightening - it sets a really soothing mood.  CF, you've got that down packed! Next time I'm just going to stick to my favorites of Tamales and a pasta.  Oh, also coming earlier than 7pm!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=900

Emma T.,"Wellington, New Zealand",0,20,,4.0,7/3/2014,"Have to give it 4 for the cheesecake. We went once for a meal and 3 more times for the cheesecake counter. This place is huge, beautifully decorated and this place is busy. We got wise to this and went shortly before 5pm, very early, I know but it worked. Later and you are queuing to get a buzzer to put you in the queue. Crazy. Husband had a pizza and declared it OK, very chain restaurant. Miss ordered a kids pizza but they were out of kid sized bases so she got an adult for kids price.  I had the best salad of my life and probably the hugest salad of my life, Sheila's Cashew Chicken Salad. It was so big, I would take a portion that size to a shared family meal. It was full of each ingredient and perfectly balanced, I will attempt to replicate. After our meals and being new to this Cheesecake Factory serving size thing, we ordered just two. I say that in jest as one would have been enough. We had the OREO® Dream Extreme Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Both were lovely and enjoyed by all three of us. They loved up to expectations.  Other evenings we shared one slice between us from the take out counter, it is just inside the door on the right and you don't need to join the huge queue. We took the cheesecake up to the next level of the Royal Hawaiian Center and found a seat.

Stacey C.,"Kent, WA",73,39,19,2.0,7/24/2012,"Apparently the Cheesecake Factory is THE place to be because there was an hour and a half wait just to be seated. The group I went with was hungry so we went across the street to Jimmy Buffet's to wait and grab an appetizer but bad idea, don't do it. Not because Jimmy Buffet's was bad, it was nice, it's just that when we actually got our food at the Cheesecake Factory we had so much food we couldn't eat. One thing that is not helpful at all about the menu is that there are so many choices. Maybe too many as it took us forever to decide what we wanted to order. I wanted something light so I just ordered the Tomato Basil Pasta. The tomatoes were delicious, and it tasted really fresh, the chicken, however, was overcooked and not too appealing which seemed to be the consensus of everyone who had chicken in their dish. I also tried my friends Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic and the sauce was delicious! Can't really go wrong with garlic! The service was pretty good, our waiter was cheery and helpful. Sadly, we had no room for cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=900
Patrick G.,"San Antonio, TX",107,801,35,3.0,12/23/2012,"I only stopped in here last night for some take out cheesecake for dessert and still could not escape the inconvenience that is going anywhere near The Cheesecake Factory.  I have never seen a Cheesecake Factory that doesn't have a huge line out the door and what seems like hundreds of people gathered out front.  I never understand why this is the case because once I've gone inside, I noticed how huge this restaurant is.  With such a huge restaurant, you'd think that there wouldn't be so many people waiting out front.  I guess there will just always be a two hour wait no matter how many seats there are inside.  This being said, I remind you I was only here for takeout dessert.  The total experience took about 20 minutes.  In that time, I waited in line patiently to get to the takeout counter.  I was walked into, stepped on, and hit by a flailing arm of a passerby.  Despite all of these hardships, I still waited in line for some cheesecake.  As I finally got closer to the counter, I was lucky enough to see inside the display case of all the different flavors that were available.  This was when the real fun began.  A group came in and disregarded the line that had formed at the counter and proceeded to yell in my ear about what they wanted, reach over my shoulder to tap the glass in the display case that I waited patiently to see, and then push me out of the way so that they could get a closer look and yell their order to the woman at the counter before me and the two people before me had even been helped. This entire experience reminded me why I try to stay clear of touristy areas.  Especially The Cheesecake Factory.  At least the cheesecake was delicious, and the best part was that I did not have to eat it anywhere near this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=900

We had a short wait time, 30 minutes for a table. We were sat in a section the was just on the verge of outside, we waited and waited for our server to come to the table. Bread was brought before our waitress even showed up. When she finally came we ordered both drinks and food. Waters, a child juice and a martini. Thirty minutes later, I had to ask for our drinks. It was water!!! A table came in after us,they received their drinks and food BEFORE us. Every time we wanted something like more water we couldn't find our waitress. When our food finally arrived, it was obvious it was sitting in the kitchen waiting to come out to us. Our fries were not piping hot or fresh out of the fryer. My sandwich had started to get soggy on the bottom.

The hostess rudely replied there are no tables outside, if you want to sit outside you have to wait like everybody else. We showed her the 3 empty tables. She reluctantly sat us on the patio. We placed our orders and waited over an hour for our food to arrive.  Two tables next to us sat down after us, ordered there food, ate and left and we still hadn't received our plates.

We had two managers come out and apologize for the long wait on our foods and assuring us that our food was the first out of a big batch. Sadly when the manager came back around he had to let us know they had accidentally over cooked one of our meals and so happened to be the last chicken they had left. Again I understood stuff like this happens specially on a very busy night.

Attempted to beat the lines and went at 10:45-ish. Sure enough, no wait! The menu was incredibly long but I ordered the Louisiana Chicken and my friend got the Crusted Chicken Romano. They were both really good! I especially loved their chicken seasoning, best chicken I've ever had. HOWEVER, I found a long piece of saran wrap stuck to the chicken but the manager promptly came out to apologize. No biggie I guess as long as it isn't bugs in my food. The service was pretty good too; drinks were always kept full. SIDE NOTE: Their iced teas are the ""literally iced tea"" kind of ice tea! If you like your sweet tea, it's better for you to order something else to drink. Next is dessert! If you're here for lunch, I'd highly recommend their smaller lunch specials (available til 5 p.m.) because you'd have more room for dessert! Now this is the reason why (I believe) people brave the long lines for this place: cheesecake! There were so many choices (cheesecakes themselves were 1.5 pages long accompanied by another 1.5 pages of other desserts) that it'd be cool if they had some sort of cheesecake sampler. Ordered the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and the Vanilla Bean. They were both very sweet but VERY good. I've tried the frozen Cheesecake Factory cheesecake from Costco but these are entirely of another quality. Couldn't finish either cheesecake because was too full (even with the lunch-sized specials!), be sure to have a glass of water on hand. All in all, it was a great experience and I'd come back again!

First off, we asked for knives because our table had none for us to butter our bread but she forgot and never brought any. Second, I ordered a beer and was almost done with my first so I ordered a second beer because I didn't know when she would be back.

I am familiar with the stacking laws in Hawaii but I didn't need another glass and I had no other beer bottle on the table with me and my bf who is well above drinking age. When she came back to the table as expected a long while later (15 mins) I told her to cancel the second beer. She said ok but proceeded to ask us if we were done with our appetizers even tho there was still some on the plate. She never checked to see if our drinks needed to be refilled.

They have a convenient location in Waikiki and even validate parking. It is a great place to stop for a late night bite. There are seats at the bar too.

Margret C.,"Las Vegas, NV",208,1405,760,4.0,8/26/2010,"This has got to be the busiest Cheesecake Factory- whenever we pass by, there's a ton of people waiting to get inside. I've eaten at the ones back home a lot, so I am familiar with the food. I'm sure that this one will incorporate some local flavor.  We came here on our family trip (in-laws). I don't remember what everyone ordered except for my mother-in-law's kalua pork nachos- talk about tremendous! We were all busy eating our meals and she kept telling us ""I hope that you help me finish this."" The size of that platter could have easily fed four people- I'm serious.

Olivia D.,"Honolulu, HI",553,560,187,4.0,10/9/2007,"I know, I know: it's not cool to review a chain restaurant. For some reason, everybody hates chain restaurants. Well, I like The Cheesecake Factory. Like, not love. I've been to the flagship store in Marina del Rey, the one in Macy's S.F. with the view of Union Square, and the one here in Waikiki three times and every time I've had excellent, professional service and very decent food in a great setting.  If you can, get a table in the extreme back of the restaurant overlooking the lush garden. It seems to be a little less frenetic back there. I recommend any of their salads, especially the French country salad with beets, asparagus, goat cheese, and pecans. The last time I went, we had the goulash, which I really liked, and the chicken and biscuits (actually, biscuit) which I moderately enjoyed (it was a tiny, tiny bit too sweet for my taste). The server actually gave us a strawberry shortcake biscuit, which was such a hit with the table, we ended up ordering--guess what?--a strawberry shortcake for dessert. I always get the fried calamari too, because it is always so perfectly seasoned and crisp on the outside and I love the garlic aioli and cocktail sauces. Stay away from the Asian-style courses, unless of course, you enjoy pseudo-Asian fare like the kind served at American Chinese restaurants. I actually haven't eaten the cheesecake here since I was a kid, so I don't remember what they taste like!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=960

Lots of foot traffic as it's also near Forever 21 & Macy's. The wait for our table was for one hour so know you should shop around to kill that hour. Once seated our server was quick to attend to us. We started with the calamari which was not overly breaded and tasty.  Our table shared the Chinese chicken salad, mushroom burger with fries, sweet corn tamale, and Tex Mex roll. Their portions are SUPER DOOPER HUGE!!!! So of course we had leftovers. Overall the foods we had were cooked well and full of flavor. Tex Mex rolls had a nice spicy kick and love the dipping sauce. The sweet corn tamale was a unique and enjoyable dish - it had a sweet hint but the tamale was prepared like mash potatoes with avocado, their secret sauce, cilantro, tomatoes.  This dish is a must try. We were so stuffed but we could not leave without sharing dessert! So our server recommended we try the Oreo cheesecake. It was just the right amount of sweet for us with actual Oreo cookies. Their menu has over 200 items and can be found online, but one of their red wine, Barons De Rothschild, Lafite Reserve Specials was unavailable at this location. Regardless we had good food that made good times. Heads up this place is loud so if your looking for a quiet dinner this is not a place to go.

I wish there was another cheesecake factory for locals to go to!  Anyways if you want to come here for dinner I would suggest coming an hour before you actually want to eat, since most of the time you will find a long waiting line. So 5pm is a good time to be there...anytime after 6:30pm the wait time can be over an hour long!  FOOD:  We always pick and share the:  *GRILLED SHRIMP AND BACON CLUB: consists of perfectly cooked shrimp covered in a very yummy special sauce. It comes with a side or fries or salad and runs at around $15, it is also very huge!    *STEAK DIANE: A deliciously seasoned steak, grilled onions, and mushrooms doused in a tasty awesome wine sauce. It comes with mashed potatoes that are oh so good! This is another huge plate and is around $20. mmmm.. these two entrees!!!  DRINKS/CHEESECAKE: They have really good drinks but kind of expensive I think they start at like $7. My favorite is the Sour Appletini and the Skinny Long Island and my favorite cheesecake is the Oreo and the Original with fresh strawberries.  SERVICE/PARKING: The service here has always been good, although they are supper busy they always manage to attend to us and times when we've had problems with the food, they've quickly returned and replaced i.e. stale fries. If you park at the Royal Hawaiian you can get the first 3 hours validated, and then it's $1 an hour after that.

For the tourists: Yeah, cheesecake factory isn't the most exciting place to go in Hawaii, but the food is good, and reasonably priced for what you get. A lot of the other Waikiki restaurants, national chains and others will give you a lot less and charge you the same price.  The best time to go is before 4:30 . This place gets crowded fast.

We had 3 drinks and 2 pieces of cheesecake for a total of 54.95 (including a 7 dollar tip). The cheesecake was only $7.50 per slice. This means each drink was $10-12.

Once we browsed through the extensive menu (the menu looks like a short story novel but included the wine list and cocktail menu as well) we were ready to order.  I highly recommend ordering the lunch portions of the pasta if you want to minimize leftovers to take back to your hotel and most importantly leave room for cheesecake. The pasta dishes were fantastic in both flavor, portion size and presentation! The burgers were also great (extremely filling).  We lucked out on dining there during their national Cheesecake Day (July 30th: all cheescakes were half price!!). The service as good and attentive considering entering the extremely busy period.  They seemed to have alot of staff to handle the crowd.  When we left (around 5:30pm), the line up out front was absolutely nuts?!?!

Ben D.,"New York, NY",420,38,,4.0,6/20/2012,"Despite the long wait time and the fact that it is in the most touristy area on island, I have a strong, undying love for this place that I've come to for some pretty big occasions, many of which happened to be birthdays, including my own a few years ago. I recommend going for lunch if you're looking to get in and out relatively fast because the dinner crowd is like no other and will have you waiting anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours. Luckily, it is located on the west side of the Royal Hawaiian shopping center, so feel free to shop while you wait. But be sure to come back earlier than your anticipated seating time because they often seat you faster than they expect to. When you get inside, there are four or five different areas of the restaurant that you could be seated in. Dining outside in either of their two outdoor seating areas is always enjoyable and personally preferred. Most times you'll be seated in the indoor booths - still nice.  The wait staff is trained quite thoroughly on the menu and are very helpful for friends who are overwhelmed by the menu - be warned, it is a very extensive menu and quite easy to get lost in. The waiters/waitresses are also really friendly, though conversation with them is tough as the restaurant is extremely busy. Wait time for food is pretty standard, maybe 10-20 minutes, and is entirely worth it as the food always hits the spot (and there's complimentary bread to munch on while you wait - it's divine). Personal favorite dishes include the Wild Mushroom Burger, Garlic Noodles, and Roasted Vegetable Pizza. If you're looking for meat options, consider ordering their Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna, a Cuban Sandwich, or their Shrimp with Angel Hair pasta. Otherwise, ask your server for their favorites and order accordingly.  What I haven't gotten around to trying is their breakfast or brunch menus, though I hope to change that soon. As for dessert, cheesecake is a given - and there are so many to choose from! They are all guaranteed to be good. My favorite two are the Key Lime Pie and the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate varieties, conveniently located next to one another on their menu. You receive in quality of service and food what you pay for, so definitely splurge a little when you come, you won't regret it! This place is great for birthdays, special dinners, or just going out with friends. As cheesy as it sounds, any night is a great one for the Cheesecake Factory.

Raych D.,"Honolulu, HI",695,497,1585,4.0,2/8/2011,"I come here for the salad not the cheesecake!!  I don't ever try to attempt coming here at nights no more due to the ridiculous wait which can be from 45 minute to 1hr and a half!! So, I've only been coming here whenever I feel the need to shop at Forever 21's newest location in Waikiki during the day time, and wait is usually 15 min. They do validate so that's a good thing and parking is free and located in the Royal Hawaiian.  My recently came here with my ex on New Years day for shopping and lunch. Whenever I come here I usually go for the spicy ahi tempura appetizers, salmon and mashed potatoes or the cobb salad. This last night I came I ordered the western bbq chicken salad with fried onion rings. I hate onion and I ate those onion rings like it was french fries! The chicken breast was so soft, moist and juicy I forgot that it was even the breast part of the chicken! And the salad came with avocado, corn, tomatoes, ranch and bbq dressing (on the side that is). My ex ordered a salad as well with some fruits on it and a sweet and sour vinaigrette dressing. I usually only care for ranch on my salad but this dressing was actually pretty good!  The maple bread is really good enough for me to eat especially because I don't care for carbs. The drinks are fabulously good that I'm forgetting that I'm drinking it in the afternoon. My favorite are the sweeter martinis! The cheesecake that I do remember trying was the original and caramel. It was a bit to much and to rich for me but what do I know I don't cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=920
Jessica K.,"Augusta, GA",366,1203,1284,3.0,6/12/2010,"This has got to the busiest Cheesecake I've seen so far and they do a great job of cranking out tables as soon as possible. We came in on an early Saturday night and were told 15 minutes. Our buzzer flashed a little after 15 minutes and we turned it on only to stand around aimlessly for the next 10. I'm familiar with there being a little time in between for staging but 10 minutes was kind of ridiculous, but they were busy up at the desk so I let it go. Our server Heather was fantastic and very thorough with her descriptions of dishes and answering our questions. I felt her enthusiasm to be quite genuine and rare to find in a Cheesecake Factory server. I wish I could have taken her back to San Francisco with me and had her teach the servers there a thing or two about hospitality.  Our only issue during dinner was the fact that one of our pasta dishes was undercooked. The pasta was suppose to be overcooked and soft and it came out hard in the center of the bowtie noodle and a little harder than al dente. We asked for it to be remade and some joker of a man came by the table just to say, ""you guys okay? Your food will be out in a little bit."" He didn't stop at the table but rather did a walk by and with a hurried demeanor. We later found out the  guy was a manager. He didn't help the situation but rather irritated the hell out of me. However, our server was so apologetic and was great about everything I couldn't hold it against the restaurant. My moco loco was a little salty but it was nice to have something different on the menu besides the usual crispy spicy beef or buffalo chicken sandwich. We also didn't stay for dessert because the portions of meals were so big and the weather outside didn't allow safe temperatures for cheesecake slices. I might get takeout if there was nothing else open on the strip by the beach but I wouldn't dine there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=920
Kristen U.,"Aiea, HI",58,46,27,4.0,6/4/2012,"Cheesecake Factory, your wait is ridiculous. Once for a friend's birthday, we had to wait about 40 minutes for a pager and another 1 hour and 20 minutes for a table. I've been here many times and the only time I waited less than 1 hour was when I dined in after 9 pm. However, despite your absurd policy of not offering reservations, I always, always, ALWAYS come back because you're just that good! I can't stay away! I think I need help. It impresses me that this location is such a mad house but service is never compromised. I've never had a bad dining experience here as the servers are all very sympathetic over the long wait, but patient and helpful when I'm deciding on what to order. My absolute favorite dish is your chicken madeira - it's superb! Other favorites include your mac & cheese appetizer, quesadillas, and shepherd's pie. Of course, I can never leave here without taking home a few slices of cheesecake (since I can never find tummy-room to eat it at the restaurant). My all-time favorite is your Godiva Chocolate. Good Lord, it's the finest piece of cheesecake that I have ever had the pleasure of eating. I'm a chocoholic and the richness of it is phenomenal. A great way to finish off the evening. In addition to the great service and food, the ambiance is really beautiful. I prefer eating out on the patio (?) - the one that's right across the lawn from the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. It's much quieter out there than inside the restaurant. My rating of 4 stars is going to stand until the day you decide to offer reservations - I'd be a regular here if I didn't have to wait so long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=920

Diane Y.,"San Francisco, CA",132,147,5,1.0,3/15/2012,"They need to start taking reservations. Period. Maybe they can be extremely strict about on-time arrival, like ""if you do not arrive within 2 minutes of your reservation time, your spot will be given to the next person and you will be at the back of the line"" or something. It is a HUGE waste of time to have to wait an hour every time I dine here. Their lack of a reservation policy indicates that they are okay with wasting their customers' time, which is a reprehensible way of running a business. Just think of it this way. If you have a party of 2, and your group makes an average of $40/hr at their jobs, the opportunity cost of eating here is $80, just for the wait time. At that rate, they should be paying YOU $10-20/person! The food is decent but overpriced and the less-popular cheesecakes are always stale.

My hubby had a huge plate of the chicken salad and that too was flavorful.  The chicken was served over a bed of rice, which I thought was interesting for a salad.   For the price, the service, the ambiance way back at the bar and no lines to wait at 5p.m. in midweek deserves at least a 4 star from me =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=920

Got a table at the time specified. Bussers didn't do a good job cleaning under the table, slippery mess underneath. Server was efficient but not very personable.  Started with the spinach artichoke dip with chips and fried macaroni and cheese balls. Oily and rich! For dinner, I ordered the Scampi and Steak Diane with mashed potatoes for $21.95. Good price! Food came at the perfect time. My steak was cooked to perfection but came cut in tiny pieces. The mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful. (Maybe LOTS of butter?) I had for LARGE pieces of jumbo shrimp scampi. The red wine sauce for the Steak Diane was a bit too tangy. Ask for it on the side. So full, we had to order cheesecake to go.

Let's start with my first meal.  I'll take the miso salmon.  It's delightful.  Turn to page473 of your menu, and Its halfway down.  I know, you're asking yourself how a mainland chain restaurant could possibly make a terrific miso salmon.  But they do!  It comes on a bed a superb mashed potatoes.   My second meal: Chicken Piccata.  I always ask for it without mushrooms (I'm ""allergic""), and not once have they made the mistake of putting them in.  This is so great with their angel hair pasta.  They give a generous portion, so I can eat my leftovers the next day! Another great thing about Cheesecake is the bread.  The sourdough is excellent, and if you ask for them to pack some with your leftovers, they usually are happy to oblige.   The only negative?  UGH...the wait.  If you'd like to go there on a special occasion, be prepared to wait.  I've gone there for three birthdays of mine, and every time it's been close to a 2 hour wait if not more.  I wish they took reservations for parties over 8 or 12 or something.  My personal hint: bring snacks  ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=980

The hosts at the front desk seemed really disorganized, and our server barely made eye contact as he rushed around. The guy was pretty much a ghost.   I had the Red Velvet cheesecake (my personal favorite) and a glass of milk. The cake is usually melt-in-your-mouth amazing, but this particular slice seemed like it had been sitting in the display case a bit too long.

Reuben R.,"Waipahu, HI",33,264,158,5.0,3/29/2010,"I've only been here a few times, but each was well worth it... yes, even after waiting two hours in line at night. If its really bad, they'll give you those radio buzzer things. But as for today, its a scattered shower Monday after Spring Break, and we came a bit early. We pretty much knew everything we were going to get already from looking at the menu before hand online, which I suggest doing. Its a pretty extensive menu. I've just come to the conclusion that there are just too many things I want to try... so we'll have to come back again!  So, we decided to get something from the specials menu rather than the lunch menu. We asked our waiter how big the portions were and he told us it would actually big good for the both of us. Coming here for dinner before, I already knew it'd be way more than enough for me, so we told him we were going to share an entree, the Chicken Madeira and we also picked out the fried mac and cheese. My friend told me she first saw them when Paula Deen made them. We were quickly brought our water and an extra plate, and warm whole grain and italian house bread.  Shortly after, our appetizer came. It was battered macaroni and cheese topped with grated parmesan over some sort of sauce. The parmesan made it a little bit too salty, and the sauce wasn't striking in flavor... but the ball of macaroni itself was great! I loved it, and I already want some more.  When our entree came... indeed it was big. We even had leftovers afterwards. The chicken was over batter and layered on top with cheese. I enjoyed it a lot because it didn't taste too heavy, and was definitely not dry. The sauce around it was very rich tasting, with a dark wine type of flavor... but I have to admit... those mashed potatoes are what I loved about the dish! There was finely mashed and peppered red potatoes, as well as tender chunks.  For dessert we got a slice of carrot cheese cake! The carrot caked balanced out the sweet cream from the cream cheese just right. As a little kid I didn't like the thought of a carrot cake and didn't know it was good until I had tried one. This was so much better than a normal carrot cake!

There's so many other flavors out there! That being said, they're clearly used to handling the traffic of a Waikiki afternoon, and the service was quick and friendly.

Michael S.,"Honolulu, HI",170,159,330,2.0,12/9/2011,"After years of being open and having lived in Hawaii all my life I've never had a chance to have dinner at The Cheesecake factory. The food wasn't that bad but the wait was horrible. Parking: This one of the main two negatives of this place. Difficult to find or no free parking. Sure you can park in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping center parking lot and walk like a block and then still pay or you can walk a bit more and park for free by Kapahulu Atmosphere: Overall its pretty nice. I like the look and feel of the Cheesecake factory. For some reason it reminds me of Vegas. Dark  lighting, music in the back ground and nicely decorated surroundings. Service: The biggest negative of this place is the usually long wait. I went in with my girlfriend for a 7:30 dinner time on a Thursday night.  We put our name in and 40 minutes later we sat down. I particularly don't like to wait for any restaurant this wait was extra long. Overall service wasn't that bad  once we actually sat down. The waitress was helpful and the water was never empty. Another negative was that we were very close to another couple. Basically it felt like we were sitting at the same table together. It didn't feel like talking because it would have interpreted our neighbors conversations Price: Since this was my first real visit I was pretty surprised at the overall prices. I always thought it was in the 20-25$ range to eat here but there are at least half the entrees within the $10-17 range. I choose a chicken club type sandwich which came out to $12 but was pretty big including the fries.  I'm sure everyone can easily find a good meal for $15.  One negative regarding pricing is that Cheesecake factory rarely participates in any kinds of discounts of coupons Food: So my sandwich tasted great, but it did come with some cost.  Nutritionally the food is horrible for you. Just look up the nutritional value  and you'll see that most of the meals have all the Fat, cholesterol and sodium you'll need for the entire day.  One of the negatives of my sandwich (chicken club) was that the bread was toasted and loaded with butter. Every time I touched my sandwich my hands felt really oily.   Overall: The Cheesecake Factory is pretty safe and to be expected(other then slightly lower then expected cost).  It's a pretty nice place overall, but be ready to wait hours for cramped quarters. Also just like any other chain restaurant expect the food to be filled with perservatitives that make the food last longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=980

Even if you recieve somewhat bad service, its hard to be angry as you watch your server sprinting around trying to give personal service to the never ending guests without skipping a beat or even stopping to catch their breath. Although ""romantically"" lit, the place is super noisy, so don't go if you are looking for a nice quiet dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1000
AdnerB M.,"Livermore, CA",0,91,,2.0,3/20/2012,"2 stars because the overpriced burger was exactly that, 2 stars and meh. I know who orders a burger at the cheesecake factory!!! Answer: my husband. We came here for lunch and had a giftcard we had received for xmas, 2 xmases ago!!! So that goes to show you how much we come here. We tried this one because the one at home is ALWAYS packed and has a 45+ min wait for dessert on most nights.  The service itself was alright and my food personally was delicious (I think it was a chicken tortilla roll up dish?). I had to avoid all the delicious alcoholic beverages because I had a massage scheduled later that day and was told not to drink :(  So instead I got a raspberry lemonade ($4!!) but it was so tasty! Long story short, if it wasn't for our giftcard, probably wouldn't have ventured out here and probably won't be back (in honolulu or otherwise).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1000

Joe W.,"Honolulu, HI",94,134,48,5.0,10/25/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory has once again amazed me with its high quality of service.  I think people give them a hard time because they're so corporate, but this is a really great restaurant for a really decent price.   Service: Sure, you have to wait for a while up front, but once you get in, you're well cared for and not made to wait any more.  The Cheesecake Factory has service distilled to a science.  Ever nuance and every minute is accounted for.  Ever talked to a server from Cheesecake Factory?  I'm sure he/she will tell you about their extensive training.  Notice the little details--how your seater always engages you in conversation, how menus are presented together when everyone's seated, how entrees always arrive together, how servers come back to check on you after every course.  All of this to provide us with behind the scenes, seamless service that, if all goes perfectly, we won't even notice. Food: My girlfriend and I visited the Cheesecake Factory for no other reason than it was a Monday night.  Here's the rundown on the food: Strawberry Lemonade:  Served in a cold, larger-than-expected glass with sugar around the rim, the strawberry lemonade pleasantly surprised me with how much actual fruit was in it.  It was apparent that real lemon and real strawberries were crushed to make the drink.  It was not overly sweet as many lemonades are.  It was worth every penny. Ahi Carpaccio: The description on the menu falls short in describing this refreshing dish.  The ahi was thinly cut and fresh.  I detected no fishy taste.  Before ordering, we were afraid that the wasabi pesto would be overwhelming, but it was well balanced.  The sweet shoyu dipping sauce was a nice touch, and the picked cucumbers were great for cleansing our palates of any fishy taste at the end of the appetizer.  A really great dish.   Salisbury Chopped Steak:  This dish was tender and savory, with a generous portion of mashed potatoes.  The gravy was dark and rich and went well with the steak. Crispy Chicken Costoletta:  This dish came with three butterflied and breaded chicken breasts, mashed potatoes, and asparagus.  The breasts were crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  The lemon sauce was creamy and not overwhelming.   Venue: The Cheesecake Factory is always busy so it's always going to be a little noisy.  But it's really no big deal--you can't hear what other people are saying and they can't hear you.  You don't have to raise your voice to talk; there's just always a barely noticeable din in the background.  The tables and seats are always immaculate, and the lighting and music is pleasant and intimate. I don't know if you can tell.  I'm a big fan of this place.  Nevermind the wait, just do it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1000

Once our beeper thing went off, we went inside and had to wait to be seated among the inside madness. We were then seated outside, right next to where everyone is sitting and waiting.

Once I got my order there were only one, didn't realize till I had walked out so I didn't bother with it. Before I left, I paid with my credit card and the gentlemen behind the counter said I was good. I asked if I needed to sign anything just to make sure and he said no. My total cost was 8.90. After about 3 days I checked my credit card statement going over expenditures and noticed I had a bill or charge of 10.00 even from Cheesecake Factory. I called the company and asked for a Manager. Once I finally started talking to a manager, he seemed dismissing, telling me he would check and call me back. I know $1.10 may seem minuet but it is principle. How can some dude working at an establishment write in his own freaking tip without approval from the holder of the credit card. That has got to be illegal in some way.

We got there around 6:30 & as it was a ""Friday night in Waikiki"", I wasn't totally surprised to see that it was packed when we got there.  When we saw how many people were outside with beepers just waiting to get into this place, my friends & I took some time to decide if it was worth it to eat here & if all 6 of us were willing to wait.  After consulting with each other, we decided to take a chance at waiting & put our name on the list.  The guy told us it was going to be about an hour & 10 minutes before the next available table.   To kill time, we decided to go to Forever 21 which was right next door. I mean, 6 hungry girls with time to kill, what better way to distract ourselves for 1 hour than to spend it in FOREVER 21.  But first, we wanted to be sure that the beeper would still work from inside the store.  The host told us it would work on the first 2 floors, but just in case, it didn't hurt to be back outside just before 7:45.  Sooo, if anyone's ever wondered about that, there's your answer! :)  The beeper ended up going off while my friends were in the fitting room & we ended up missing our table.  As soon as it went off however, we quickly paid for our things & ran downstairs.  Luckily, the staff at the front door was nice enough to let us go and they gave us the next available table.  The menus are massive!  There are soooo many freaking choices.  It was so hard to decide and I had been to Cheesecake Factory before, but it was such a long time ago that I forgot how long their menu was.  I got the pasta carbonara w/chicken, which I give 4 stars.  My friend Kayla had the gumbo which she said was really good. My other friend Karen had the fettuccine which she rated a 7 (on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being best).  Overall, it was a great experience, with great food & customer service to match.

As we sat at the table, the FIRST thing I noticed was that our forks were laying ON THE TABLE. To me, this is unacceptable.  Its UNSANITARY.   The server was quick to arrive.  She did not mention her name or anything. She literally just started saying ""Our specials are...blah blah or you can look on Page 8 for the lunch specials"".  She did not even take our drink order.   When she came back, she finally took our drink order and we placed our food order.  I ordered the lunch Miso Salmon (13.95) and my wife orders the appetizer Crab Cakes (12.95) as her meal.  I also ordered a draft beer , she asks ""What size? the 16 or 22 oz?  I said, ""Just the 16 oz"".  The 22 oz was $8.00.   She returns with waters for both of us.  My water literally had only 7 ice cubes in it.  Just one layer of floating ice.  My ice actually all melted before my food came out!  The beer she brought me was the 22 oz.  Why ask me if youre not going to bring the one I ordered? At least it was the correct beer.   My Miso Salmon was good.  Its hard to mess up salmon unless you overcook it.  The sauce was good.  One piece of salmon over  a bed of brown rice and some snap peas.   My wifes crabcakes had 3 nice size pieces.  It wasnt as crabby as I thought it should be.  Seemed like a lot of filler.  Everywhere I go, crabcakes come with some sort of sauce. This one came with tartar sauce and it wasnt very good. We ordered dessert to go.  We had the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake (7.75).  It was really good. As we waited, I watched the busser bus the empty tables around us and watched him pull a bar towel out of his apron.  He didnt spray anything on the table, or dip it into a sanitizer bucket or anything.  So basically, wiping the table with a dirty towel....and thats where our forks were laying!  GROSS!  Potential to pass on disease, germs, and whatever else was on the previous table!   Will I be back?  Probably not anytime soon.

Fast forward to Mother's Day, my mom wanted to come here because she wanted to shop at the 3-story Forever 21 next door, so we came in for their brunch (only served on Sundays).  Still not knowing what to order and craving a caesar salad (those get me every time) I ordered the salad and pizza combo again, but this time I got the margherita pizza and mom got the sunrise fiesta burrito (egg, chorizo, peppers, onions, potatoes, and cheese and topped with salsa, cilantro, and an avocado cream sauce served with a side of black beans).  I already knew what my food was going to look like, what i didn't expect was mom's footlong breakfast burrito.  This place cannot stop surprising me with the size of their food.  Her burrito was soo tasty too, the only thing we didn't like were her black beans, way too salty.

Also, try not to order appetizers unless you have a big group. You want to save room for the meal and DESSERT which is why you're at the CHEESECAKE Factory, right? About a week ago, we all came for a celebratory dinner. The wait was about half an hour around 5:00pm and we were seated near the outer area (which I prefer because inside is too dim). Being such a big fan of steak, I decided to order the ribeye. However, on their menu, they only mentioned the ribeye being grilled and not ""char grilled"". Hence, the special request. Unfortunately, I don't think the waitress knew the difference. She stated, ""oh, it is."" when I asked for my ribeye to be char grilled. Needless to say, the food wasn't up to par.

I really like when the waiters check in on you, refill your bread and water while you wait, but our waiter never did that.  The only time we saw him was when he brought us food.  We even had to get up and find him to get our check because we got tired of waiting.

Brian N.,"Richmond, Canada",0,8,,2.0,5/6/2015,"I've been to a few different Cheesecake Factories and they provide a consistent experience.   It's a popular food chain but has an extensive, varied menu.  Last time I dined there, I decided to go light since their portions are large.  I ordered the Endive Pecan Blue Cheese salad and an order of Buffalo Wings to share.  The wings came first and they looked amazing.  They had a nice dry rub on them as opposed to the overly saucy wings you get at some places.  They tasted good until I got into my second wing and noticed my lips and throat burning but it wasn't from the hot sauce.  It was a pure sodium burn, these wings were so salty!  I asked my wife to try one and she agreed that they were way too salty.  I told the waiter about them and asked if by mistake the cook put too much salt on them.  He said they were all done the same and shouldn't be any saltier than any other batch.  I couldn't eat any more of them and he agreed to take them off the bill.  When I got back to my hotel, I looked up the nutritional chart for the wings and it stated 4420mg of sodium (over twice the daily recommended maximum intake of sodium).  No wonder.  I don't know why restaurants feel they have to over-salt most items.  I understand a reasonable amount of seasoning makes food taste better but this is just overkill.  I had to drink a gallon of water just to flush out the sodium from a couple of wings. On a good note, the endive salad and my wife's advocado spring rolls were quite tasty.  As well, the original cheesecake was very good (we also tried the Hershey bar cheesecake but the enjoyment was distracted by the amount of chocolate chips and cake in the dessert).

Overall, for the money spent, this was a huge let down considering how crowded the place is.  I guess tourists flock here because there's only one or two in their state.  We have like 4 here in the Bay Area and I was reluctant to go because of that, but the outdoor seating and the fact that it was Cheesecake Factory Waikiki drew me in.   With all the great restaurants on the island I would definitely avoid this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1080

Mitchell N.,"Aiea, HI",105,77,117,4.0,10/14/2009,"Aside from the fact that there's nothing local about it, the Cheesecake Factory has a diverse menu, terrific food, and good service.  Our party of 5 may have arrived at 5:30pm and were seated within 30 minutes. If you walked there's plenty of shops nearby to pass time in, if you're trying to find free parking you'll be in for a headache. That there's only one location, in Waikiki, may be no surprise to residents but makes for a convenient restaurant for those it likely caters to.  The wait staff is very friendly and helpful, despite being very busy. The waitress was also nice, though service was a little slow. Also, the only area open to us in 30 minutes was outside on Kalakaua - taking down the ambiance a few notches but overshadowed by good food. First up - the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo: I've never been to the South, but it was easily among the best I've ever had. It was slightly spicy, sausage and shrimp were great, and worth the $17 dollars.  Double burger: If you've ever wondered what a true super-sized McDonald's Big Mac would be like, this is what it would be - except the bun in the middle is simply another top sesame bun. Too much food, but good. Wasabi Crusted Tuna: This was perhaps the disappointment of the bunch. The ahi was fresh and well cut, the miso sauce tasty, but for the price can't rival that found in some of the Japanese restaurants on O'ahu.  Sliders: Seem to be all the rage nowadays. Good, but a better (and less expensive) option is at Yardhouse, in Waikiki.  The intent was to go and have cheesecake, and though we didn't order it, left feeling no less satisfied.

Katie K.,"Honolulu, HI",46,73,15,4.0,11/14/2011,"Let me preface this review by saying I would never wait the crazy two hour wait that is normal for dinner time at this Waikiki tourist hotspot. However, when I get off work and can get an open seat at the bar, I'm very happy to be eating a late dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. (And they are open till 12, so late night eats are always an option here!) Although I can never imagine taking the menu test to wait tables here, I think its safe to say that there is truly something on the menu for everyone! If you can't find something to order here, you probably should never leave home! Seriously, pasta, sandwiches, salads, tacos, fresh fish, you name it, they got it! And being that they are so corporate, the food is consistently good, no matter what you order. My favorite of late has been the blackened chicken sandwich with a green salad instead of fries (although they do offer sweet potato fries which are highly temping!). The sandwich is massive--as in I usually take half of it home--and costs less than $12! Can't complain about that! Their salads are yummy too, but I know from experience that the lunch size portions available in the daytime are much more managable! So if you want to brave the crowds (normally a 50/50 mix of Japanese tourists and and mainlands tourists too scared to branch out and try a restaurant they don't have back home...) the Cheesecake factory is usually a tasty choice. Just remember, it will be less crowded if you're up for a late lunch or even later dinner. And they do validate parking in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center parking lot, always a plus!

For entrees we had Chickaken Farfalle (pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, chicken, panchetta), miso salmon, wasabi encrusted mahi. Dessert was Snicker, Godiva, and strawberry cheesecake. I was disappointed by most of the dishes. None of them caught me and our Passion Fruit Mojito was horrid. They did NOT muddle the mints, sugar and lime juice. This has to be the second worse mojito I've had or the laziest mojito bartender. The mint flavor was overpowering and I could not call this drink refreshing.  The honey oat wheat bread was good while hot. The lettuce wrap appetizer was a fairly large portion enough for three people. The Spicy Ahi tempura was a mere five pieces (for $15, value was lacking here). Farfalle dish flavours were inseperable. The Miso Salmon was good but I want to believe it swam happily down my throat because the amount of sugar put into this dish.  If you come here, do yourself a favor. Come before the late evening crowd, skip dinner, do NOT order the mojito or collect $200 go directly to the cheesecakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1040

Can't get over these Waikiki establishments that treat locals like second rate customers.  We walked in--obviously local residents dressed appropriately, and host guy was local too.  Lo and behold, we were directed to the far back at the tiny table off to the side. There were many available large tables and booths near windows. Also, there were many parties of two sitting on these desirable tables.  Sorry, but with a ton of other places to try,  we didn't feel like trying to work it out with the host. and left.  We probably won't be back, and I WILL yelp this.  I'm on a Staycation (the Sheraton Kai Suite has been phenomenal), but I will maintain that all too often, businesses like The Cheesecake Factory make me save my money for vacations out of state.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1040

Those are the three easier ways to describe the cheesecake factory.  The cheesecake factory is an American eatery that offers many different types of items on their enormous menu.  Each time i visit it takes me quite a time to decide on what to order.  But not matter what I order the food is good.  I especially love the deep fried macaroni and cheese which are macaroni and cheese balls breaded and then deep fried and served with marinara.  Every time I come here even if I tell myself ""you will not order the mac and cheese balls this time""  I always end up ordering them.  My favorite cheesecake here as well is the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake and it is delicious.  While you cannot go wrong with almost anything on the menu there are other things you must watch out for. This location is a great location for the restaurant but leads to many problems for the customer.  It seems as if the restaurant is in a weird shape and they do not have enough seating for people waiting for a table (and people wait hours for tables literally hours.)  If you plan on coming during dinner time on a weekend plan on waiting for at least an hour.  While this place is good it is not wait around for an hour good.  Your best bet to avoid these lines is to arrive from about 2-5pm and you will not have more than a 15 minute wait.  At 5pm they open up the entire restaurant for dinner service so a good time to show up is right around 5pm.  Showed up at 5pm with a group of 8 and was seated within 5 minutes.  Oh yea forgot to mention this place also doesn't take reservations so either show up early or be prepared to wait.

Then I finally get to the register and I order cheesecake with strawberries and tell the female cashiers to add bananas and she gives me a look of WTF......wait Im the customer and Im paying so you should make my order...especially when its not that hard to slice some banana and put it on the plate right? WRONG! I even asked her if there was something wrong with me ordering cheesecake with bananas and strawberries and she said nothing wrong to do it, but when I get my order theres no bananas. I didnt get charged for them either, but I wasnt going back in line and I was over being in the factory with the current staff on hand. I was out. When I get outside and start to eat it the cheesecake wasnt even cold. It was almost room temperature. Im all about understanding there are bad nights and stuff hits the fan but that night TOO MUCH STUFF HIT THE FAN. Im not gonna give you a one star rating but whoever is in charge better get the staff in shape.

It was really annoying when we kept asking after an hour how long the wait is and they kept replying with the mandatory sayings, ""20 more minutes, setting the table now..."" I think NOT! I would have really appreciated if they just told us up front how long the wait would be instead of sugar coating it, then we would have choose another place to satisfy our hungriness!  So we get buzzed then we have to wait again to get seated! seriously I guess there are different levels of waiting..  Level 1- Waiting outside, making sure that your stomach is really empty! Level 2- Wait for Host, now you really need to eat be cause you already waited 2 hours and you can smell the aroma of the food and see all the food passing from the kitchen to the customers.

One of my coworkers had suggested this place which is located in the trendy Royal Hawaiian Complex. My niece and I had to do some clothes shopping at Forever 21 (also suggested by my coworker) and she told me to go here since it's one of her favorite restaurants. Plus they validate. :)  The interior was nice, kinda cold, but they seated us closer to the lanai so the AC wasn't as strong there. My niece ordered the chicken quesadillas, which she loved, and i order the macadamia encrusted Opah with brown rice and sauteed veg. The brown rice and veg had this really tasty sauce that was great in the beginning, but began to get a little cloying towards the end. The fish too was overcooked and had a really fishy taste to it. Okay, I know that sounds stupid and I hate when people call fish too fishy, but this was the first time I've ever encountered this problem  and I've had Opah before. So now I know and I promise never to criticize anyone from ever saying it again. *I swear*  For dessert, we had the original cheesecake with strawberries. That alone was worth five stars. Really yummy, rich and tart. We both loved it. Will definitely be going back for that alone.  One thing I thought was funny was the bathrooms. They were REALLY chic. It had dark mood lighting and really spacious stalls. The music that was running through the restaurant was slightly muted in the bathrooms as well.

Not due to the food, which I actually happen to love, but just due to the service and overall dining experience. Especially at this particular location, which is constantly busy and slammed with mobs of people, resulting in an almost always hour-long wait. FOOD: + love their complimentary bread (whole grain & sourdough) + their menu has such an overwhelming and impressive range that it is impossible not to find something you'll like + bang bang chicken & shrimp: definitely good if you like thai curries, it has a creamy coconut flavor, with the right spices and flavors (sweet, savory, spicy) over fluffy rice + miso-salmon: so well-prepared with a huge juicy and flakey salmon filet + cheesecake is always a must here, my favorites include pina-colada, dulce de leche, and white chocolate raspberry truffle SERVICE: I definitely dislike almost all the hosts/hostesses there since I find many if not most of them quite rude in how they handle their guests. I understand to a certain extent since I am also a host at a busy restaurant and it is hard to provide the best service with such a high volume of customers, but still! Plus, I hate how they just automatically ASSUME I am a Japanese tourist and hand me a Japanese menu, when I do not even speak Japanese whatsoever -__-  On the other hand, though I've had several times where I've had crappy servers, I had the most excellent waitress serve us on my most recent visit. She had a great sense of humor and despite how busy she seemed, she always had time to check up on us, make suggestions, chit-chat, and re-fill our drinks.

Robert C.,"Honolulu, HI",17,32,65,3.0,9/28/2010,"Rating: 3.5/5 Date(s) Visited: 9/15/10 Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Price: 3/5 Located in the heart of Waikiki, it's only natural that Cheesecake Factory would be eternally busy. But is it worth the hour long - or more! - wait? That depends. If you're in Waikiki to do a little shopping and are looking for a place to eat afterwards, then yes, but if you're just looking for dinner, then probably not. Food: Their food quality is, by and large, good. Their menu items are vast and mostly original. Their menu is so large, in fact, that you'll be certain to overlook a lot of things that might spark your interest. I know I did. We ordered their ""Thai Lettuce Wraps"" which came with assorted vegetables, strips of chicken satay and coconut curry noodles along with peanut, sweet red chili and tamarind-cashew dipping sauce. This was my favorite dish out of everything we ordered since it was absolutely monstrous and rather flavorful (as long as you used the dipping sauces). I can say that I didn't much taste the coconut curry noodles and the only sauce that was worth my time was the peanut sauce, but other than that this dish was remarkable. Next came the ""Fried Macaroni and Cheese"" which was surprisingly good. It's coated in a thin, slightly crispy bread coating and sprinkled with cheese. Breaking into the sphere of goodness, the cheese pulls apart from the edges like it does in those pizza commercials. The flavor was incredible; having a sharpness that tells you it's homemade, though the marinara sauce seemed to be the parsley of the dish. My friend ordered a side of garlic mashed potatoes, claiming it was the best he ever had. Meh. I've definitely had better and their potatoes I found to be lacking proper seasoning (a bit of salt and pepper fixed that). I'd give this dish a pass unless you're really craving starches. The final thing we ordered (besides dessert and drinks, but that's later) was their ""Firecracker Salmon"". Now, I've made ""Firecracker Salmon"" as fillets for dinner, and I can say that I'm rather disappointed at the absolutely tiny portions we received and the stunning lack of flavor. It's more fizzle than firework. We got four pieces of salmon wrapped in fried wonton skins. The whole thing was about as thick as my thumb and not much longer (see:  ). It was served on a mountain of shredded purple cabbage. I felt like we were paying $13 to get $10 in cabbage and $3 in salmon. The sauce it was served with initially has no flavor, but then the heat arrives and soon departs. It's delicious for the few seconds where you can taste anything, but other than that the dish is a total flop. For the price, I wouldn't recommend it. For dessert we ordered we ordered the key lime cheesecake which tasted almost exactly like a key lime pie. Their whipped cream was made with real cream (because they whipped it too much and it had the faint taste of butter) and topped with a thin slice of lime. They had two giant scoops of vanilla ice cream on the side and I can only imagine how amazing it would have tasted with chocolate sauce. I suggest you get it with coffee, because having the bitterness of the coffee right after the tartness of the cheesecake is divine (although my friend said it sounded gross). My friend got their ""Pomegranate Mojito"", which looked delicious. Just as a warning, he said it was super strong and was later intoxicated for the rest of the evening. Then again, he's a lightweight so... Service: Aside from the absolutely ridiculous wait, the service here is good. The waiters are patient and professional. They don't hover and they're not constantly interrupting your meal. They see that you need a refill of something and get it. Atmosphere: I had the misfortune of sitting right next to their live performers, which made conversation next to possible. I guess that no matter where you sit in the restaurant, it'll be loud. The lighting is rather dim and very orange, which makes photographing food very difficult and next to impossible to color correct, but that's a photographer's complaint. Other than that, it's reasonably enjoyable. Price: The prices here are definitely a bit spendy. Although you can get some good values (e.g. Thai Lettuce Wraps), I feel like you'll miss more than hit with a lot of the things you'll find on the menu. When I looked at the bill and saw that my friend's drink had cost $11, I gasped and nearly had a heart attack. Then again, it's Waikiki and everything's expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1120

Glenn S.,"Honolulu, HI",25,26,,4.0,8/8/2011,"We had a mini stay-cation at the Moana Surfrider and decided to eat lunch at The Cheesecake Factory. Wait:  Arrived at 2:30pm (Yes, late lunch) and had to wait less than 5 minutes to be seated.  Score!  Appetizer:  Fried calamari with garlic aioli and cocktail dipping sauce - a little on the greasy side, however my 3.5 year old did not object as she was eating this like there was no tomorrow.  I prefer the cocktail sauce as it balanced out the greasiness, even though the batter was light. Entrees:  Barbecue chicken pizza - topped with red onions and cilantro (you could say their version of CPK).  I actually loved Cheescakes version of this CPK Classic.  TCF crust was lighter and the chicken was thinly sliced, compared to CPK which has chicken chunks and a tad thicker crust.  This alone made the pizza much more appealing to me.  Definately would order this again. BBQ Chicken salad - Don't get me wrong...I love CPK, however for some strange reason...out of the gazillion things you can order from the menu, we happened to get TCF versions of CPK food,  Haha.  So guess what???  Yes, I prefer TCF salad over CPK's.  Here's why.  The price for the full size salad at TCF costs less than CPK and TCF salad is BIGGER and tastes justs as good, if not a smidgen better.  Value! Dessert:  Linda's Fudge Cake - If you love chocolate, you will indulge in this!  Chocolate cake layered topped with fudge (of course) and chocolate chips on the back side and layered with chocolate frosting in between the layers of cake.  Rich & Delicious! Overall:  TCF has something for everyone and our server was fast and attentive which is always a + in my book since I have worked in this industry before.  I look forward to my next meal and need to try the coconut cheesecake that a friend recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1120

Daniel B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",429,63,26,4.0,7/30/2010,"OK to be honest, I'll give it 3.75 Stars, but rounds up to 4! :) What intrigues me is that people from all over the world come and flock to the Cheesecake Factory like it's some kind of Hawaiian tourist attraction... Wait, don't they have them everywhere?! With the crowd building up outside, we decided to walk on in to check in. Thankfully my friend was smart... skip the line and sit at the bar!  I chose the restaurant, Cheesecake Factory is her spot. I simply knew I was going to enjoy my meal.  The service here is fairly quick. Even with the vast amount of people that were there... our glasses of water were filled, we were checked up on, all with a warm smile.  On the menu: Pasta da Vinci (I think that's what it was called) with Broccoli & Hibachi Steak (mine). I freaked out at the sight of bean sprouts on which the Hibachi Steak sat on (I dislike bean sprouts) but it wasn't that bad. I'd like to say the steak was memorable, but it was just good. I did think the wasabi was an interesting twist as a topping on mashed potatoes. Dessert: Wild Blueberry with White Chocolate.  The cheesecake was nice and fluffy, not uberly thick like plain old cheesecake. It was decent, what disappointed me was that it wasn't fresh blueberries! But I guess I'm just a bit picky. Haha.  All in all, great atmosphere... Lively, Upbeat but just a bit dark in some parts.

There is always something for everyone to find in their booklet sized menu. We love their spicy ahi tempura rolls. The tuna is flash-fried in tempura, drizzled with a sweet/spicy and what tastes like mayo sauce, topped with scallions and served with a dipping sauce which has nice 'kick' to it. Their kids size pepperoni pizza is a full serving for one adult! And their red velvet cheesecake is to die for!  The only thing I was disappointed in was our waiter. He seemed to be very attentive to the other two tables next to us (5 ladies of which 1 of the 5 sent her entree back because it was prepared incorrectly and the other table who were tourists and who asked for separate checks). I guess this put our waiter behind because he would repeatedly check on them while passing by our table and not checking to see if were ok as well. We have a toddler.

If you plan to go on a Friday or weekend you should expect to wait 1.5-2 hours for your table.

That's what I did with my friends last night and the three of us were sitting down eating our delicious free bread in less than 30 minutes!! The food here is good and the price is not very high. I paid $19.50 for my meal incl. tip and couldn't finish it all (the portions here are HUGE) so I had lunch for the next day too!

Our waiter was very attentive to our table. We ate during lunch service. This isn't necessarily a con, in a sense, but when you ask for a box, they actually take your plate away and box up your leftovers themselves. My question is, where do they do it? In the kitchen somewhere? Is there an exclusive Boxer person who's specialty is to box up food? Does the server do it him or herself (what if you upset the server, will they botch your leftovers with spit or something)? Seems kind of shady. Once it's boxed up they put it in a bag and tie the bag up, so keep that in mind if you have leftovers, or just finish your plate. Minus 1 star. Recommendation to any couples going in to eat: Request a booth. I repeat, request a booth and if the wait is extra for that, then so be it. You will thank me. If you do not request one you may be seated in a section of the restaurant where tables for two are all setup in close proximity to each other and you will pretty much be dining with other couples.

Alvin P.,"Mililani, HI",6,7,,4.0,1/16/2012,"Okay, as someone who lives quite far from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, I come out here once in a while to eat at The Cheesecake Factory (mainly because a lot of my friends like going here and it's either this or Zippy's.) Anyways, besides what everyone else is saying about the (at-times) ridiculous wait times, the food and service here is pretty good! There has never been a time when I was utterly dissatisfied with the food and/or service we got. Hosts and waiters are extremely friendly (my host made a joke about how she wouldn't be able to fit into my skinny jeans as she led us to our table) and the waiters are very friendly, are quick to answer any questions you may have on their diverse menu, and don't pester you to hurry up and scram once you finish your meal (we were still eating even though the restaurant was closed.) I got the Chicken Bellagio, which wasn't HOLY SH*T(!) spectacular, and a bit bland for my taste, but it was still the same level of quality I've come to expect from The Cheesecake Factory. Here's a tip: if you're here for the first time, you may think that their dishes are a bit pricey for what you're seemingly getting, but damn, it's like the restaurant is planning on fattening you up to cook you, because the portions here are HUGE. Therefore, if you and your friend are both ""eh...kinda hungry but not really,"" then I highly suggest splitting an entree because both of you will probably be full, happy, content, and all that jazz. If not, just ask your waiter to pack up the rest of your food in a doggy bag and heat it up the next day at work or something. Every single time I've been here, I never been able to finish all my food in one sitting. And trust me, I have the appetite of a ravenous gorilla. Parking is also super convenient. Free with validation at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.

I'm giving a national chain a 5 star rating. This is a place I don't even come to voluntarily (please see my below rating for reference to BF dragging me here: ) But their customer service and attention to detail should give them an extra star.  OK, here goes: We went back last night. We ordered Buffalo Blasts. They were delicious. This place has THE BEST BLUE CHEESE DRESSING. Hands down. Great dressing base and then tons of fresh blue cheese. Anyway, we also had the Steak Diane/Madeira combo and a BBQ Chicken Salad. All were, as always, really really tasty.  This is why I'm bumping the Factory up a star:  My salad was a little late getting to the table. Ok, not a good reason to give them an extra star, but the manager came out with my salad. He told me they had to make another salad because mine had been sitting there. They messed up on the original order. No biggie. It wasn't even that bad of a wait. The manager apologized. I accepted and continued on happily with my food. At the end of the meal, we ordered a cheesecake to go. The bill arrived and the server said the cheesecake was COMPED because of my wait for the salad. Wow! Thanks! You just voluntarily gave me a slice of cake. On our way out, the manager ran into us and double checked that we were happy when leaving. He apologized again and hoped we were content with the free dessert.  The Cheesecake Factory is always on their game. Mistakes are going to happen though and when the do, they really step up to the plate and muthafuckn deliver. Obviously this place has the means to give me a free slice of cheesecake, but it's the thought that counts.

Scott M.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",27,255,5,3.0,8/3/2010,"I am being generous giving this place 3 stars because it is someplace between ""meh, I've experienced better"" and ""A-OK"". We wouldn't come here, especially on vacation in HNL if we didn't get dragged by local friends who think of it as a treat away from the local places they love. The Good Side:  The food is alright, not great, but not bad. It is over salted, but the portions are generous and with a menu just a bit shorter than War & Peace, you have to find something you like. 84 Entrees, 50 Appetizers? That is kind of on the bad side of the good side. I'd rather they do 12 entrees really well, 8 appetizers really well and be done with it. Also on the good side are the deserts and of course the cheesecakes. The Bad Side:   The wait. There always seems to be a line here, we have never walked in, 30 minutes is a short wait, 1 hour isn't uncommon and I've heard of 90 minutes and more. This food is not worth a ten minute wait, let alone 30-40 or more. If you could walk in, be seated in 10 minutes, I might say ""yeah, I am a fan"", but at the wait times here, it is just okay. More bad is the servers, they seem indifferent to doing a good job, personable, nice and all that, but just not that good. If you've waited 45 minutes, you might be hungry and thirsty. Take drink orders right away, check for appetizers off hand and ask again about appetizers when you bring the drinks. Maybe because they get so many tourists they know they'll never see again they don't feel compelled to excel. Maybe they are not well trained or managed. Maybe because they get so many Aussies who don't know how to tip.....  whatever it is, it needs to change to get better. After you've waited 45 minutes, you don't want to wait 35 more for the first morsel of food, but with 50 appetizers, they don't pre-make much.

I already have the Cheesecake Factory (CF) experience from traveling so I expected the same or better. Hawaii's CF is very much better. The environment and ambiance reigns true in most CFs around the country but Hawaii's includes an island flare, with CLEAN, large dark lit rooms (almost like a nightclub) with lauhala fans, and open air dining available. The food is fantastically simple, yet extremely tasty. I usually order a factory burrito (sans the rice and beans) and deep fried mac and cheese to which I recommend to everyone. Other notable choices are the furukaki salmon and ribeye.  Service is impeccable, every server is willing to answer questions and refill your drink. So please tip well all my fellow yelpers.  The only problem is the crowds during the dinner rush. Lunch time is much more relaxed. I still find myself waiting in long lines simply for the cheesecake. Godiva cheesecake and the Passion fruit cheesecake are the best. Everyone should come here, please check it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1180

Okay with a name like Cheesecake Factory the cheesecakes better be good. Yes it lives up to their name, every cheesecake I had is delicioius. Okay so we know the cheesecake is good but what else. Well here is my theory if you gotta stand in line and receive a pager and wait to be called, the wait better be worth it. I first went to CF in LA with my friend. I fell it love with it from the beginning. Portions are huge! Now it does not have the best tasting food, but with cheesecake lurking it always help. Great staff and open atmosphere! My favorite food include the sheppard's pie, bang bang chicken and pasta. Now if this place wasn't in Waikiki would it do well? Heck yeah locals love large portion.

In the hundred times we've been here, i've gotten fairly young waiters/waitresses who are always friendly and fast. The bread is okay. My  boyfriend and I always eat the wheat first, then save the sourdough for something to nibble on while we wait for food.  The wait really depends on how crowded it is.. but they usually do a pretty good job.  I've tried so many items and they were all delicious. The huge factory burrito, jambalaya pasta (my fave), kolbi(?) burger, white chili, chicken medallions, da vinci pasta, chicken carbonera, pesto pizza (discontinued, boo) etc. etc. . ALLL very well made, and good.  The calamari is also yummy as hell :) Always freshly fried so it doesn't taste oily. The thai spring rolls are also really good! HUGE portion with a ton of sauces.

It's a little difficult to have a normal conversation inside because it's a bit noisy in there.  We got in around 6:00 and had to wait approximately 30 minutes for a table for 2.

I recently had the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich.  It's so much more than a regular club!  I think the dressing they use puts it over the top, plus it big!  It's enough for two people who don't want a full meal, the club makes a great late night snack. This is another great LATE NIGHT place that stays open later than most.  Plus they fully validate you for 4 hours, good for those who need the validation.

Shannon G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,3.0,7/26/2014,"We have been to this particular location two separate occasions. The first time we ordered three main entrees; the Chicken Madeira, the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, and the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. The Madeira is touted as the most popular chicken dish, however is was only ok in my opinion. It was not bad, but also not fantastic. The gumbo was ok, and the pepper shrimp was just so-so. The second time the Factory Burrito Grande and the Skinnylicious Asian Salad was ordered. The burrito was decent, and the salad was quite good. The only part of the salad I did not care for was the rice noodles.    On the positive side of things the service was good and the bread they bring you before the meal is very good. It also has the added benefit of keeping away the grumbles as you wait for your entree.    There are several issues you may want to keep in mind if you are thinking of venturing to this location. The first being the wait. Do not be surprised if they tell you the wait is over an hour. It is a busy restaurant in a tourist location. Second, their menu can be quite overwhelming. It is too large and can take a person quite a bit of time just to go over their dinner options. I think that they could benefit trimming down the amount of dishes they offer, but since they are already an established chain I doubt that will happen. The lighting is also very dim in there. It's quite dark for a restaurant. Also, if you are ordering for kids, they put a lot of pepper on the vegetables. The carrots were too spicy for a kids menu item, so you may want to request no pepper for the little ones.   Overall the experience was fine, but nothing special. It is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. If that's what you're looking for, you got it! If the wait is more than 30 minutes it is probably worth trying something else, unless you came for the desserts in particular. The desserts are quite good, but can be very rich so take your time! There is a separate line and checkout for purchasing cheesecakes togo, so if you only want one of those you can get one without waiting for a table. It was a convenient location for us since it was right next to the hotel. We were able to put our name in to wait and then go back to our room for the hour they quoted us. If we had to sit at the restaurant and wait over an hour, we would not have stayed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1200

Tina T.,"Honolulu, HI",24,89,63,3.0,10/24/2012,"Since moving to Hawaii 3 years ago I still haven't tried the Cheesecake Factory, mainly because I was deterred by the excessive long lines and waiting time.  Yet I was always intrigued what's so special about this place, so this past weekend I gave it a try when we were in Waikiki.  This place doesn't accept reservations so we had to put our names down at the front, and we were told the wait would be 40 min.  I haven't waited for any table at any restaurant for that long in years but so be it.   Our table was ready on time and we were swiftly taken to our table.  Our waiter served us water and took our drinks order immediately.  Then he brought some nice warm bread to the table.  Thumbs up. The menu is huge and the choices are abundant.  I ordered the bang bang chicken & prawns, and my friend ordered the moroccan chicken with cous cous.  The food took a while to get to us and even though we were served warm bread, after waiting for 1.5 hour in total for the table and the food we were famished.  The portions were big, catering to the usual american tourists.  My plate was a bit disastrous (very unappealing, just look like they plopped the brown rice in the middle and just dumped the sauce and chicken on the side).  I think the presentation could have been much improved if they just placed the sauce with the chicken and prawns in a small bowl sprinkled with the coconuts, then placed the bowl on the plate with the rice.  Taste wise it was pretty salty, and the coconut sauce had well, no wow factor.  Even though I was hungry I could only stomach 1/3 of the meal b/c it didn't make me want more, plus I wanted to save room for the cheesecake of course. My friend's dish on the other hand looked and tasted fab!  Our waiter was very slow to respond so we got fed up waiting another 20 min for a piece of pumpkin peacan cheesecake so we ordered it to go.  The bill and the cheesecake took another 15 min to get to us.  Total time spent more than 2.5 hours!   Needless to say I won't be back unless it's with visitors who insisted on trying this place.  And if I want cheesecake, I'll just order it from the counter to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1200

Started with the fried avocado spring roll appetizer as directed by the daughter.  She loves these things.  Very fresh and generous serving of avocado in a deep fried spring roll wrapper served with a cilantro  dipping sauce that is reminiscent of chimmichuri but is sweet.  Different but delicious.   She had the chicken scallopini which was very flavorful  with a nice overlay of lemon.  The hubs had Steak Diane which was wonderful...tender steak encrusted with peppercorns and a Madera sauce that was generously served but light in consistency.  it was nice that there was enough gravy to sop up with the mash potatos or the bread assortment they serve. The tenderness and flavor of the steak was truly surprising and rivals a steak served at any high end steak house.  I had the seafood chowder and there was an assortment of seafood in a thick New England style chowder.  Very filling.  We were too stuffed to eat dessert so Cody talked us into cheesecake slices to go.

I've eaten at the Waikiki restaurant many many times.  If you arrive there after 6pm pretty much any night then you'll have to wait FOREVER for a table.  So, I try to eat at unconventional hours or between 5 and 6.   Now that we have a baby, I find the restaurant to be great for kids.

The service was ok although our waitress gave us incorrect change (by a $20 margin) and almost began to argue when we asked for the correct change.  But to her credit, she was generally friendly overall.   The portions are a bit ridiculous looking around at other dishes...I could easily order a normal dinner sized meal w/cheesecake and ask them to box 3/4 of it before the meal even gets to the table and i'd still be full.   I would've gone 1 star for that disgrace of a burger but since the cheesecake was not bad I decided to go with 2.  But man that stuff is ridiculously sweet.  Much too sweet and heavy for my taste.   This place is quite the epitome of the things (and amounts) America loves to eat, but really shouldn't eat.   I'll take people's word for it that the other dishes taste good, but I probably won't go back unless i'm with someone who really wants to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1240
Jenny C.,"Honolulu, HI",30,141,23,4.0,7/27/2010,"Hold the phone, I haven't reviewed The Cheesecake Factory?  Where have I been?  So I've been here a LOT...and even ordered out a lot so I can give feedback on both. First of all, the only time I have ever not had to stand in line for this place was like at 10 pm on a Saturday night so beware.  They are constantly busy and do not take reservations.  If you go during the busy hours (I would say between like 6-9?)...you can expect to wait up to an hour.  Is it worth it?  I kinda think it is!  They have an extensive menu in terms of entrees and desserts.  However, come here expecting to pay a chunk of change...entrees are not cheap but the portions are great. I've had...a variety of things here.  I'm sure I could give you feedback if you messaged me about a certain item.  This past weekend though, I tried their portabello on a bun and it was AWESOME.  God, I am drooling just thinking about it.  I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but their portabello is so thick and juicy....you won't even miss the meat.  I also tried their warm apple crisp for dessert...and yummm.  I've been on an apple pie kick lately and this was great.  It comes with basically...the apple pie filling with a mountain of whipped cream (It's too bad that I don't like whipped cream)...and two scoops of vanilla ice cream...all drizzled with caramel.  So good...I thought there was a bit too much walnuts...but I don't hate walnuts so it was fine.  :)  Their appetizers are good, entrees are good, desserts are good...! I caution about big phone orders, I've done a few and never do I get the right order.  They always miss something...and it's hard to check every single plate in the restaurant (especially when you have 20+) orders...and I feel bad about saying that because the girl at the bar who assists you is SO nice.  Just make sure you double check everything before you leave.   Also, if you go during their busy times...don't expect to have a good conversation when seated...it gets so loud!  Parking is in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center garage...and they validate 3 hours for free!  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1220

Also, I wouldn't come here for a birthday.  Most places you go will offer you something for your birthday...even a place that is known for desserts might give you something small.  However, you're required to buy the overrated cheesecake here, and knowing that my mom's Perfect Cheesecake was waiting for me at her house, there was no way I'd pay for their weak offerings.  In a lot of ways I'm glad I didn't...another person had a birthday as well and the staff singing is horrid and unenthused.  So, in a way it was good that I wasn't subjected to that aural disaster up close.   Still, I've had a number of good experiences in the past.  They still have big portions, and the Shepherd's Pie is always delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1220

The food choices are endless but i ended up ordering the ""Hibachi Steak"" which comes with tempura asparagus, wasabi mashed potatoes and of course the angus steak with shitake mushrooms. This was one of the best meals i've EVER had in my life. I think its amazing that they have such a huge menu yet they make each item with such care. After the meal I of course looked over the cheesecake and based off the descriptions alone; I dont think you can go wrong at all. If i could rate this place higher I would.

Drink menu is great also, i love the Peach Bellini (frozen peach drink) and my aunt had a mai tai (didnt taste it, she said it was good, but she has never had one before, so...). I ordered the Herb Cursted Salmon and Steak Diane. Very good. And we had a pizza, burger and burrito at our table everyone seemed pleased. Service was not over the top outstanding, but the best that we have gotten since being in Oahu! It was very loud with the combination of music, crowd out side walking past, full restaurant and quite spoken server. They serve a bread basket with a great brown bread. mmm... And of course a page and a half of cheesecakes! Mmm. My favorite is always Chocolate Mousse. But we also had Godiva Choc and a White Chocolate/Carmel/Macadamia which was great... Prices range from $8-$21 on average for entrees. Cheescake from $6-$8 and my bellini was $9 and mai tai $10 I always like to stop by TCF even for a drink or appetizer when in a town that has one.

They actually seated us in 70 mins or so, so I happy because it's all about expectations.  It was my birthday. I wanted something different.  I order the steak Diane and salmon. Wife got the jambalaya pasta. Kids the combo pizza and mom in law got the cashew chicken. Bread was a nice treat after the long wait.  The service was great. Didn't check on us for more water or bread, but otherwise happy people.  I liked my dish, although the salmon was different.  Moist. Just different.  Pizza was good.  The jambalaya was flavorful but the noodles were clumped in to a mashed gruel.  What is the opposite if al dente?  Gruel.  The chicken cashew was moist but the good stopped there.  Awful tasting and somewhat burnt.

Its actually a bit different in Hawaii. Its seems a little more classy in Hawaii than some of the mainland ones I've visited.      First thing I completely dislike about this place is the droves of tourists standing in line or clogging up the aisle ways.  arggh...why would you eat at someplace you already have in your home state? This totally boggles my mind. There are so many other places to eat in Hawaii.  Even in the tourist trap called Waikiki.  Its like if I went to Arizona or Idaho to eat Hawaiian food.     Food is good but you get Waikiki prices for restaurant chain food. I have had the Steak Diane and Shrimp scampi.  I felt these were two good and solid food items.  I was kind of surprised that there was more mashed potatoes than the main entrees.  The Shrimp Scampi was a different from what I'm used to.  A butter and cream sauce with tomatoes and parsley. It had maybe a little to much parsley but it was good. The shrimp had a nice crust to it.  The steak was cooked to a middle rare and tasted pretty good. Overall pretty good solid meal. I do admit its a little more classy in Hawaii than the others I've been to in the mainland.  The presentation seems different and even the quality.  I could be wrong.      The cheesecake is pretty uniform everywhere.  I liked the Apple Strudel, Mac Nut and Key Lime.  I think I could avoid the Key Lime.  They whip the cream cheese to like a key lime pie.  I rather have a key lime pie.  My absolute favorite here is the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake.  Cheesecake=Good and Pineapple Upside down Cake = Good. Cheesecake factory got the equation right on this one.  Cheesecake + Pineapple Upside Down Cake = Awesomeness! Its not some over sweet mutation.  They balance it out very well.  There is cake, pineapple and cheesecake. Delicious! There is a little to much whip cream but I just don't eat it.     Service was great and the waitress was very nice. This is great because sometimes you don't get good service in a restaurant when it is so crowded.  food came up  fast and they kept the refills flowing.  bonus points for me.  Overall, even though I feel this place is a bit overrated but I do have a pleasant experience every time I eating here.  I know people write and talk about this place like its a god sent. It's good but I'm not so sure its worth fighting traffic, finding parking and fighting off the droves of tourists for a seating at the tourist trap called Waikiki.

I shared a club sandwich and ceasar salad with my girlfriend, both of which were drenched in mayo and dressing respectively. The bread was floppy and thin and too sweet.

I am serious too, 100 times. and there goes Love's street cred on yelp, instantly gone. Since opening in Honolulu 5 years ago, I have eaten at CF, 3 times.  Don't ask why. I have no answer. Nothing on the menu really impresses me, except I like the Ranch and I dip everything in it. I always complain that the chicken lettuce wraps don't come with enough chicken, the scampi is too oily, I don't like the chicken marsala, the salad's aren't healthy, I dig the fried mac n cheese balls but after a couple bites I tank 2 glasses of water, it's rich. Cheesecake is like any other cheesecake but with crazy swirls and toppings. Yet, when I visit Vegas in January, I will probably eat at CF in Caesers. again don't friggin ask.

Chrissy K.,"Honolulu, HI",10,84,6,4.0,4/6/2009,"We ate here on a Sunday night at about 5:30.. Our wait for 2 was about 5 minutes!  I live nearby and we were walking around and decided...hey lets eat at cheesecake, it's been awhile. It looked like there was a long line, but it was just people waiting to be taken to their table, people leaving, or people staring at the cheesecake display. I'm sure if it had been 6:30 or 7, there would have been a 45-2hour wait.  Anyhow, we were seated in an uncomfortable section (not a booth...about a foot away from 2 other couples, including a japanese couple that stared the entire time....ugh please stop). We should have requested to move to a booth, next time. The table smelled like dirty rag water a bit (you know when someone is too lazy to change the water in the bucket and they still wipe the table down...yup, that. We ordered quickly...no appetizers because we knew the food was monstrous-ly sized. I got the grande burrito thing, and my eating partner got a chicken bang bang thing (some type of thai chicken and shrimp meal). The burrito was huge, but good...who can mess a wet burrito up? It came with some black beans, cilatro/guac + sour cream. yum. I ate about 1/3 of the burrito and packed it up to go. The burrito cost about 15 dollars, so It's a pretty economical deal. 2 people can eat it at dinner and there's still leftovers for 2 for a late night snack...so it makes it about a 4 dollar meal, 4 times...you get what I'm saying? The chicken +shrimp bang thai meal was just okay. But as leftovers, it was pretty tasty. I hate how they put that gigantic lump of white rice on the plate. It's so unappetizing.  We ended the day with a slice of something raspberry cheesecake. Pretty yum, although I think all the cheesecake flavors are probably decent. so if you want to have a good time at cheesecake in waikiki: eat at 5:30 so you only have to wait 5-15 minutes. Ask for a booth. Dont get an appetizer cuz the portions are huge. Eat cheesecake. The service is really good here. From the host/hostesses, to the servers, to the food-clearers. Everything was so fast and attentive. If you keep getting bad service EVERYwhere...check yourself...are you being a snotty brat?

I remembered the cheesecake being good (well, duh!), but not much else. Ordered the Chicken and Avocado club, which was chicken breast with avocado slices, bacon, swiss cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato slices, and a herb sauce on crisp toasted bread. It smelled fabulous, but the first bite was an omen. The chicken was so tough that I couldn't bite through it. The combo of the bread and cheese and herb sauce was nice, but the chicken itself was tasteless and dry. Downer. Strawberry lemonade was nice, and free refills were a bonus.

Our waitress was a little slow to come to the table, get my husband a refill on his drink, then bring the jelly, and check back after our plates had been cleared.  All was forgivable except the jelly since my husband waited to eat his english muffins until he had the jelly and so they weren't warm anymore. However, since the food didn't suck (like Boulder, CO) they get 5 stars.  If you have never been to one, they rarely disappoint.  The few times I have been disappointed (SF when they scraped sour cream off my food and Arlington, TX when they first opened and they brought me the wrong food 3 times) a talk with the manager has usually cleared it up. While most CFs have the exact same menu this one did a have a little Hawaiian flair added with Kahula pork available on the factory nachos and macadamia nut crusted fish (and others I don't remember). Again, come try it because no matter who you are with I am sure there is something for everyone. We came in at 3:00pm on a Friday and had no wait.   I was a little surprised that my strawberry martini was $12.  I thought it was $9 the last time I ordered one and while there is that toursit/Hawaiian extra added to the tab, $3 would be excessive for one drink.  However, I could just be mistaken about the $9!

Even though we got our table relatively quickly, the restaurant was jam-packed, and every waiter/waitress looked like they had their hands full (literally and non-literally).  Took our waitress about 10 minutes to get us our water and bread (sourdough AND dark rye - I like), but we didn't mind.   On to the food.  I always have a thing for the Factory's huge salads; my craving was the main reason why we chose to eat there in the first place.  Anyway, I got the Luau salad, which was a mini-mountain of mixed greens, green onions, peppers, crushed macademia nuts, and two giant pieces of wonton skin.  A generous serving, even on fatass standards.  It was probably enough greens for 3 days, evidenced by my relatively painless and almost enjoyable toilet trips the following day.  Not that I usually take painful craps.  But you get the idea.   Oh yeah, the cheesecake.  Easily the best part of any C-Fact meals.  I was too full for it that night, but got a slice of white chocolate caramel macademia nut CC to go, which I ate while watching the sunset at the beach the next day.  Needless to say, it was delightful. Verdict:  high props for consistently good food and generous portions throughout the chain.  Too bad the wait is always too long at every location.  3.5 stars (4 stars if we weren't turned away the first time). Tip:  COME EARLY! *I just made that up to earn ""cool"" votes.  I try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1380
LA Sunshine M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,103,,5.0,10/26/2009,"I like Cheesecake Factory but seldom go there because of the long wait.  Luckily I was hungry at 3pm and finally there was no line.  The food was just as good and served in just as large portions as those on the mainland.  Our waitress was pleasant and kept saying ""thank you"" after each sentence.  ""what would you like to drink?"" (my answer here), ""thank you.""  ""how was the food?"" (my answer here), ""thank you."" ""would you like any desert""...well you get the picture...thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1380
Diane O.,"Honolulu, HI",17,14,4,4.0,10/9/2010,This place was great!  I didn't go to this location before because I thought it was too loong of a wait.  This time (my first visit) was nice!  We walked in and got seated right away!  I ordered the Fried Mac & Cheese appetizer and that one was a winner!!  It tasted really really good!  The fried Mac & Cheese ball was as big a baseball,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1380
spiff e.,"San Francisco, CA",55,462,146,3.0,6/22/2006,"There were plenty of tables open but it seemed like that were a tad understaffed (given, it was 3 or 4ish so it was in between lunch and dinner time), so I had to wait for a table.  And the table they gave me was not so great.  A tiny booth in the corner of the bar area. Took the server a while to come by and take my order (i was slowly fading from starvation at that point).  Ordered one of their frozen drinks, either the frozen iced mango or the peach smoothie, both are good so I don't really remember.  Also got the avocado eggrolls which are always great and filling.  Took a while for the food to come out, but once it did, I was stuffing my face quick. Cheesecake in general is never a letdown on portions.  Actually had enough leftover to make it an appetizer for my dinner later that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1380

Joshua A.,"Honolulu, HI",22,37,40,4.0,1/25/2010,"I ALWAYS get the Farfalle Pasta with roasted garlic! The Rangoon won tons are really good too! I tried the four seasons pizza and although I REALLY like the sun-dried tomato and artichokes, I didn't care for the dried up basil that was on some of the pizza. I must service has been excellent every single time I have been there and they do a fantastic job considering how busy the place seems every time I go. I always try to save room for either the Godiva or Snickers cheesecake- but am always too full! Definitely will be back :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1380
Sylvia D.,"Salem, OR",101,46,,5.0,8/15/2007,"Chain Restaurant - Shmain Restaurant.  I love this place...and because of it's consistency.  I've been to the one in Honolulu multiple times as well as the two in Vegas (one is under another name in the Venetian) and the one in San Francisco above Macy's and service has always been excellent.  The food is really what keeps me going back over and over and over again.  My personal favorite is the Chicken Madeira but the Steak Diane, Cobb Salad, Shepherd's Pie, Meatloaf, Salmon, etc.. are all excellent and the portions are humongous.  I looooove the free bread too. True, you will have to wait awhile so be prepared but this place always makes your wait well worth it.  If you don't want to wait, go to the dessert counter and make a takeout order and take it home, eat it on the beach, use one of the tables in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.  Whatever you do, don't miss out on this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1380
Kari S.,"San Diego, CA",78,385,43,2.0,5/22/2008,"We have a Cheesecake Factory in San Diego and we never really go there since the food isn't all that fabulous. We ended up going here on a Friday evening (early) since it was walking distance from our hotel. The place was pretty full but we only waited about 5 minutes to get a table. We sat on the patio which was nice because it was quieter. Our server was Kenneth and he started out good, but after we got our main course he was nowhere to be found. We got the Chicken Pot Stickers for an appetizer, and we both did not like them at all. They were very watery and the sauce was so bitter and overpowering. I had the Pear and Endive salad which tasted fine, but the pears were mushy and slimy (had to pick them all out). My DH had the Cashew Chicken which he maybe ate a quarter of. It was so heavy and had way too much sauce. We did get the White Chocolate Raspberry to take with us and ate it later...that was about the only good thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1380
T L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,27,,3.0,11/18/2012,"Went  for lunch on 11/16/12. Got seated quickly. The hostess and server were very attentive. The cobb salad, salmon, gumbo and oreo cheesecake was fantastic. What sucked was the person that actually brought the food to the table kind of  just threw it on the table. We were sharing a salad so we asked for extra plates and he just looked with a blank stare and walked away never to be seen with plates. Lucky our server was back at our table to resolve. A few minutes later he returned to bring food to the table next to ours and had his ASS hanging on our table when he was throwing their plates down. Why come to work if you're just going to be an asshole.... just stay home and stop collecting undeserved tips from the ones that actually are doing great work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1380
Crista Y.,"New York, NY",61,167,9,3.0,12/1/2009,cheesecake factory can give you familiarity and there are abundant choices.   my friend and I were too tired after our flight to fathom venturing too far from our hotel to access dinner.  we decided to splurge and grab CF.  A good familiar default.  The bill was only $40 for two of us...sans alcohol.  Not bad.  I love how low the tax is.   I had the artichoke dip as an entree and cake for dessert.  nothing special.  i don't care too much for cheesecake..too rich but if i did i would get key lime.....that's what my friend had....and it was super good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1380
Anna W.,"Honolulu, HI",796,228,129,4.0,5/14/2010,"yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy DESSERT! i always grab a slice to go. It's the best thing ever; they're all great in your tummy... not necessarily for your figure but whatever.  I tried their passion fruit mojito the last time i went and i must say, I am not a fan of their mojitos. After that first one i got a normal mojito which wasn't great either... it makes me wonder how you could mess up a mojito. Well, i'm no bartender but i'm definitely a connoisseur of the mojitos and next time no more.  The food isn't bad either. I've had probably almost every dish since we all like to order somethign different and share a bite out of it. They were all pretty good. I wouldn't say the best bang for your buck but it's good enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-honolulu?start=1380
