It was nice, pleasant ambience, loved the initial welcome.  Ordered customized Veggie Enchiladas and my friends ordered some chicken dish. Loved the food and finally cheese cake, it was delicious, yummy White Chocolate raspberry and Godiva chocolate.  Prices were $$.

Halston P.,"Houston, TX",162,39,23,3.0,1/10/2016,"Super noisy, the employees can barely handle the customers. Good food. Y'all need cushions for the booths, they're too far away for the tables and are so uncomfortable to sit in. Waiters need to be more enthusiastic and personable. Bread wasn't brought out immediately, and had to wait around 30mins for it. This restaurant needs a make over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=300
Brie H.,"Leander, TX",21,30,,2.0,2/8/2015,"Went here with my husband for my birthday dinner, we aren't  from the area but know we like cheesecake factory. We arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday night. First off, it was an absolute mad house. They had us go upstairs to wait, and there were people everywhere standing around waiting- all the way out into the hallway which connects to the mall. The hostess told us it would be 15 minutes so we decided to wait. We waited about 20 minutes, and then were seated at a teeny  2 top table, sandwiched  between two other tables, all sharing a long booth bench seat. It was a little awkward so we asked to switch to another more secluded seat that was also empty.  We switched seats and waited about 5 minutes before the waitress came to get our drink order. She was alright, not very friendly or personable though. I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps and my hubby got Baja fish tacos after about 10 more minutes of waiting for her to take our order. The waitress came back a few seconds  later and told me they were ""out"" of the lettuce wraps. I looked for another few minutes for a second choice, and ordered a cashew chicken salad. We finally received our food, and the salad portion was enormous, and it was very tasty. My husband also enjoyed the fish tacos. The waitress disappeared again for awhile and when she finally came back I  asked to get  the ""warm apple crisp"" to go. She said it comes with ice cream on top so she didn't  think  that would  work because it would melt...we asked if she could put the ice cream in a separate container, and she said okay.  As we are waiting for our dessert, I look over at a table that was seated awhile after us, and the lady is eating thai lettuce wraps! The same lettuce wraps I was told they were ""out of"". Pretty annoying. Anyway, at this point I am just ready to get back to our hotel and enjoy the apple crisp. We get the to-go bag and head out...we get tho the hotel and I open up the box...and the ""warm"" apple crisp is completely cold. And not like it just cooled down the way from the restaurant...cold like it had simply been taken out of the fridge and tossed in a box. Very disappointing, and didn't  taste great. I was very disappointed with this dining experience, especially since it was my birthday. Would  not eat at that location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=300
C. H.,"Pearland, TX",0,6,,2.0,3/21/2015,On Saturday evenings it's pure chaos at THE Cheesecake Factory. There are people standing around everywhere waiting to be seated. The hostesses apparently ran out of buzzers and are walking around SCREAMING the names of the parties. This is not a relaxing dining experience in the least. It used to be upscale. Now it is along the lines of Chili's. I do not recommend this particular location unless you like waiting indefinitely for a table and don't mind people walking around screaming while you eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=300
Meredith C.,"Chicago, IL",234,248,122,3.0,10/17/2012,"cheesecake factory is good. the white bread makes me smile (when it's warm). the corn tamale cakes are TO DIE FOR.  they are simply divine.  NEVER look up their nutritional info. the service here was lovely.  i ate here twice over a 4 day period while in houston for a conference recently and both times my coworker and i were seated immediately and ironically at the same booth. the service was lovely - especially the second time (thanks, Marisa).   the drink refills were a plenty and the food was splendid. the following is not a compaint against this location, but rather corporate as a whole: (rolling up sleeves for rant):  you have a skinnilicious menu claiming lower cal options.  i am on ww.  i am thrilled with this option.  i find a mexican salad that sounds splendid and filling and eat 1/2 of it and think i can find the nutritional info online, but alas, it is not to be found...ANYWHERE.  CF - release the nutritional info of your freaking skinnilicious stuff.  c'mon - don't claim something is a better option for those of us who are counting watching every morsel that goes past our lips only to find out that we can't quanify it aftewards.  it's a dick move and one i'm tired of.  i boycotted corner bakery for years after they refused to publish their info and only went back when it was fully released.  i eat at cheesecake & grand luxe FREQUENTLY (twice a month) and am willing to go through with this threat if you don't change your evil ways and fess up. i am done. ps - love your cheesecake (when i'm not cranky and on weight watchers).  xoxo",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=300

Our wait was about 5 minutes, if that. And it was noon on the dot. I had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta. Penne pasta in a parmesan cream sauce with chicken breast strips. Spicy carb goodness. I was hungry but only ate a third of the lunch portion. I'd be scared to see the dinner portion.  We split a slice of the ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake and our waiter even sliced it in half and served us separately. Nicely done.

Paris J.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,3.0,7/30/2015,"Food WAS great! Awesome Cheesecake.  It was a Dinner for 4... OverAll We had a Good Time. It Was Up Until The End, that left everybody in a bad mood. Our Waitress was named ARTISHA B. She was nice in the beginning, but toward the end our dinner, Missy had the audacity to TRY & make me pay her a bigger tip. Now I understand most waiters make their money off their tips, but to TRY to make the customer pay you an even bigger tip is ridiculous. Her whole ATTITUDE & demeanor changed....Shaking her head...& snatching the tip off the tip off the table in front of us.. Everyone looked around looking like REALLY.  The tip was more than $10 which we didn't EVEN have give..Tipping is OPTIONAL... I know it sounds petty BUT that was unacceptable behavior. I know so many people that don't even tip, but I do whether it's $5 or $15... I just feel as a customer that spent nearly $170+ altogether  on ONE meal at the Cheesecake Factory. That service of a waiter is absolutely HORRIBLE. Then she suggested she could break one of My $100 bills I had for her tip... After that I told my group it was time for us to go! Later on I called the Cheesecake Factory & made a complaint.

The kids didn't care for the nachos appetizer because of all the sauces all over every chip and slightly burnt. My wife didn't like the calamari but I thought it was ok.

I love me some cheesecake on occasion in a small size with no graham crust. But a piece the size of my head is frankly a little gross.  I went with some co-workers, I had a basic salad, as they was all I was able to eat there. Again, I don't like places that have 10 page menus.

Stephanie M.,"Milton, FL",0,11,,4.0,1/31/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a must visit when you're in the area. The fried macaroni and cheese is the best!

We popped into TCF around 2pm on the Sunday before Christmas, after an exhausting day shopping and having pictures taken with Santa, for a yummy lunch.  My first reaction upon entering is that this restaurant is SMALL!  Wow, the one back in Cincinnati (which is also attached to a mall) is huge!   However, this one is two floors and so we were seated upstairs, overlooking the front of the Galleria/Westheimer Rd.   Our server was fabulous.  I wish I could remember her name. Shoulder length black hair, also works at the Hard Rock...anyway...we brought our 7 month old daughter and she was very good with her, engaging her when she came by for refills and such.  I always appreciate that. I went with the garlic noodles (I try something different almost every time I come, plus they took one of my faves - Crabcake Sandwich off the menu - bah!) It has sauteed asparagus, mushrooms and tomatoes in there.  Very good.  We capped off our meal with cheesecake of course.  I had their 30th Anniversary cheesecake, which had chocolate cake in there as well as cheesecake.

She gave us all of 30 seconds to review the menu and kept insisting we order AND we had to beg her to refill sodas.

Rob S.,"Houston, TX",1073,5,2,1.0,9/26/2015,"If you like Mexican food do NOT and I repeat do NOT order anything Mexican off the Cheesecake factory menu. The tortillas they use are the ABSOLUTE WORST GENERIC brand tortillas ever made. Ive bought tortillas in a bag from HEB that are better tasting. I've had other food here that was pretty decent but this was the first time I've had Mexican food from Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the quesadillas to start and couldn't even believe the way they looked. You can go to 100 different small taquerias in the Houston area and get a much better quality quesadilla for a third of the price. The texture was like cardboard. I immediately sent it back. I ordered the Factory Burrito and took one bite and realized they used the exact same bottom of the barrel , 1 year old stale type tortilla! I again immediately sent it back again. The manager and waiter were nice enough to ask if I'd like anything else, but the 45 minute wait and  disgusting looking and tasting Mexican fare destroyed my appetite. I can not believe a place that charges such high prices for food with SIMPLE ingredients would use suck LOW QUALITY ingredients and smile when they serve you, to pay for it. Absolutely will never even walk into Cheese Cake factory again after such a HORRIBLE experience with the food. I will stick to local taquerias with BETTER TASTING, BETTER QUALITY, BETTER PRESENTED food than to pay triple the price for what essentiall amounted to BLAND , Poor quality tasting and looking  food.

Cameron H.,"Houston, TX",160,348,,4.0,1/16/2014,"A lot better experience than the ones I remember from a few years ago... My friend and I went for lunch and started with the Ahi Tartar. Good, fresh tuna, avocado, ginger, and sesame seeds. Delicious and light! We moved on to our lunch. He got their Chicken Romano, which is like Chicken Parm. The helping of chicken was HUGE and, even while that was enough, they decided to also have a whole helping of spaghetti. My friend let me have some of each and I was definitely not disappointed by any means. The chicken was lightly breaded, but crispy, not greasy, and very flavorful. As for me, I got the Pan-Seared Mahi Mahi and Shrimp Veracruz with asparagus. Obviously, I was in a seafood mood. While the Mahi could have used a TAD bit more seasoning, the shrimp was some of the best I've had- very plump and juicy, a nice char, and it was freaking delicious! We ended the meal with 2 cheesecakes. I got the new s'mores cheesecake and he got some type of peanut butter one with Butterfinger and Reese's. Perfect end to the meal!

Ashley B.,"Houston, TX",809,74,1017,5.0,8/31/2011,"I recommend this place to hungry Houstonites, especially if their spending the day shopping in the Galleria. My views... *It appears to have rather squished seating, but there's actually a lot of space. There's table, booth & banquette seating. It's usually busy but don't let that scare you off. *Sure the menu seems endless (it's bounded like a book) but lots of options are sometimes nice - at least you know they have a little something for everybody. *I love that they have a ""Small Plates & Snacks"" section on their menu. These plates are like mini versions of their appetizers. This way, when you want more than one appetizer for the table, you don't have to pay $7.99 x3. *I've been here many times and have never hated my order. They always are featuring some sort of entree special. Also, their food portions are very generous so come hungry. FYI - I LOVE their avocado egg rolls! *The service is always very friendly, accommodating and timely. I feel sorry for the staff though - they all wear white and I always find myself thinking ""keeping those suckers clean must be death"".   *Pre-meal you're given sourdough bread and some kind of dark brown bread. I don't know what makes the brown bread so good, but slap some butter on it and try not to ruin your appetite! *I would say that their venue is fitting for large groups, date night, kids, etc. *If you don't plan on ordering cheesecake then consider yourself unauthorized to ever read any of my reviews ever again. *I HIGHLY recommend their Dulce de Leche caramel cheesecake (even though that out of the 7+ I've tried, they have all been delicious). I'm not a caramel fan so at first I was like ""eh"" but now it's my ultimate favorite! Also, you can give their cheesecakes as gifts...get them to-go to replenish your own fridge's needs...you can even purchase gift cards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=340

It's 3 huge thin pieces of chicken Milanese with a lemon butter sauce, some grated lemon peel, garlic mashed potatoes, and about 6 pieces of asparagus. I always take about half of it home because it's definitely a huge portion.  I drank apple cider, love it! It's definitely cider and not just apple juice. Service was pretty good, you'd expect ordinary service at chain restaurants that are packed, but our server was very attentive.  The place tends to be a little loud, since tables are practically crammed together unless you are seating at a booth. I found the music to be unnecessary.  I would really have to say that is one of my favorite restaurants. The menu is HUGE. Their smoothies are delicious, the bread they bring to you before your food is to die for, along with the butter.

Claude K.,"Houston, TX",12,75,27,4.0,3/20/2010,"I ate here a couple hours ago, so I'll review this place while the experience is fresh in my mind- just for you guys. No need to thank me.  Ambiance: Extremely crowded and busy. It was difficult following our server through the small groups of people randomly located throughout the building. The decor of the restaurant itself? Beautiful. I loved the soft colors on the ceiling and the wooden columns. I thought it looked pretty classy, but that's just me. Food: Get their Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Even though I'm usually not into cream-based sauces, this one was killer. It was slightly spicy which cut through the richness of the dish. The asparagus and peas were especially nice, and the chicken was tender and juicy. Their Cajun Jambalaya Pasta was good, but nothing to write home about. I did like that it was lighter than the Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta, but it wasn't as flavorful.  To be honest, I was expecting more from their Fresh Strawberry cheesecake. My friend told me it was amazing; I disagree. The cheesecake itself seemed like a plain Jane cheesecake. Plus, there was way too much whipped cream. Surprisingly, I liked the Apple Crisp better. The cold vanilla ice cream and the hot apple crisp played off each other in terms of temperature. The walnuts added a crunch factor to the slightly mushy and soft crisp. Yum. Portion size: It's big. My advice is to split an entree and dessert with a friend. Service: Our server was okay. She got the job done, which my friends and I appreciated. She delivered our food fast and smiled a lot, which is always nice. The wait time is 30 minutes on average.

David G.,"Palm Springs, CA",31,38,6,5.0,3/25/2011,"I'm kind of shocked by all the 1 and 2-star reviews. Steve and I had an absolutely perfect meal and experience, dining here for lunch. We started off getting the Asian Lettuce Wraps. We both thought they were the best lettuce wraps we've ever eaten. Delicious grilled chicken, thin cold noodles with black sesame seeds, shredded carrots, thinly sliced cucumbers, bean sprouts and three kinds of sauces. They were unbelievably delicious... and oh-so sticky. So I asked our server if they had wet-naps for our hands. She came back in a few minutes with a plate that was holding steaming hot fabric napkins with lemon slices. We were both very impressed. The appetizer and service were both 5-stars. Steve's entree was Louisiana Chicken and Pasta. Which consisted of bow-tie pasta, assorted peppers, mushrooms, parmesan-encrusted chicken in a creamy pepper sauce. Steve gave his pasta dish 4 out of 5-stars. My entree was a Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich (lettuce, tomato, chipotle mayo, homemade bun) served with sweet potato fries. Perfect sandwich. Perfect fries. Perfect 5-star rating. It's been a long time since we've both been so impressed with the service and food at a restaurant -- regardless of the fact that Cheesecake Factory is a chain.

Then steak medallions for me, I asked for medium rare and they gave me the perfect pink center. The trimmings on the plate were asparagus, mushrooms, mashed potatoes and sautéed tomatoes. My guest had a four cheese chicken & pasta dish, which he said was also very appetizing. It was a huge plate however, it could more than likely feed two.

The pasta came out HARD/crunchy and tasted BURNT. so the waiter took it back and came out soft but still burnt taste. the manager offered to pay for her dessert (kinda weird he didn't offer to pay for her pasta).  2. Even though the waiter wasn't giving us the time of day, our food & drinks were pretty much given in a timely and appealing manner. Our glasses kept being filled and when we needed something, we got it. Not the BEST service.  3. for 4 people: 4 waters, 2 alcoholic drinks, 4 meals, 4 cheesecakes = $114. THIS IS AN AWESOME PRICE!!!! not only did we take ALL 4 meals home, we took home the cheesecake. so we had lunch & dinner paid for.  Decent experience. We all LOVED our food. This is definitely not the place to go if you want to get pampered by a waiter though. I enjoy coming with friends/dates/family when we don't really want to be bothered with service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=340
Sonia C.,"Katy, TX",153,173,95,2.0,2/19/2011,"I usually love The Cheesecake Factory. This was the worst experience I've had at any of their locations.  Problem 1 - The hostess (young, attractive, long dark hair, slim) was RUDE. She walked up behind us and was extremely annoyed that we weren't moving quickly enough to get out of her way. I know they were busy, but a polite ""excuse me"" with a smile would have accomplished her goal. The slight shove paired with an irritated expression wasn't necessary. I watched her as she stormed through the restaurant upstairs and downstairs.  Problem 2 - Filthy bathroom.  When I say ""filthy,"" I mean unusable - like a porta-potty, an outhouse, or a redneck gas station. Two of the bathroom stalls were covered with diarrhea, and one toilet was in a state of overflow. No stall had any usable toilet paper, but the floors were covered with used toilet paper. There was no soap or paper towels. Obviously the customers behaved badly for the restrooms to reach that point, but it is the staff's responsibility to keep it from reaching this point.  Problem 3 - The macaroni and cheese that we ordered for the kids was undercooked to the point of being crunchy. Not al dente, CRUNCHY. Our French fries were terrible; they were cold and tasted old.  The Pros - The service was good. We liked the brown bread and the iced tea. The children's pizza was pretty good, and they liked it. Our mushroom sandwiches were good enough to order again. I enjoyed the Oreo cheesecake.  In summary, I'm not interested in going back to this location. We waited 45 minutes for a nasty hostess, a disgusting bathroom, and mediocre food. The one in Sugarland does a much better job, and I have high hopes for th new location at Memorial.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=340

Phi L.,"Houston, TX",190,102,167,5.0,8/17/2011,"I have NEVER eaten a meal at Cheesecake Factory. I have only gotten their cheesecakes and cakes. I personally think their regular food menu is really overpriced and the portions are way too big. I don't like boxing up leftovers and reheating them later on. But as for the desserts, oh my goodness, I have never been disappointed.  Flavors I've tried:  -oreo (childhood love) - it's like a cookies and cream flavored cheesecake -chocolate mousse (very very good for you chocoholics)  -reese's - big portion and super sweet! have a glass of water/milk ready, and be ready to share...but definitely not something you can have JUST one bite of. It's really rich in flavor (and probably sugar) -hershey's - celebrated its big debut last month. It's like the reese's if you like that one -kahlua coffee - slightly lighter hint of chocolate if you're a coffee/milk chocolate kind of person. less sweet than hershey's and lighter texture as well, kind of like a fluffy mousse -black out - I think this is the richest, darkest chocolate cake/dessert offered at the place. it sits on top of the rest of the cheesecakes and it TOWERS over your head! Very very big portion. I shared it with my boyfriend and we STILL wanted more after we killed it. Definitely my favorite",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=340
J. D.,"Houston, TX",60,52,21,2.0,6/26/2009,"With the long wait for a table and the crowd of people, you'd swear this place had the best food in town. First off, this place is highly over-rated. While the ambiance is okay, the food is mediocre at best.  I've been several times over the years and haven't been impressed much with this chain.  Their menu is expansive, but at the same time, I think it can be overwhelming for many because there's so many choices to choose from. Though the entree portions served are plentiful, I think overall the food is overpriced for the quality of food that's placed before you.  Of the times I've been there, I've had the chicken marsala (it's okay), a Thai chicken dish with coconut curry, rice, and peanuts (not very flavorful), pasta carabonara (too oily and lacking of flavor), garlic noodles (very bland), and creamy chicken soup (actually really good). For the place to be called Cheesecake Factory, you would think the portion of cheesecake offered would be huge like Junior's on the east coast, but it's not. Don't get me wrong, their cheesecakes are good IMO (love their tiramisu cheesecake  the most), but the price is too much for it to be a chain restaurant and for the amount you're given. The best thing to me about Cheesecake Factory though are their drinks (the reason why this review doesn't have one star). Matter of fact, some of my girlfriends and I  just make a night of coming here and ordering their drinks while we catch-up with one another.  My favorite drinks of theirs are the Georgia Peach, Peach Bellini, Typhoon Punch (beware... it's served it a big glass, but towards the end of the drink, you'll begin to feel the punch lol), and the Strawberry Creamsicle (which is a grown up milkshake spiked with vodka).  Most recently, Cheesecake Factory has started offering a small plate and snacks menu. I must say this is very welcoming because it's not only easy on the pockets, but when I do come here for just for the drinks, I do want something to snack on besides the bread, but even the appetizers were too large. From their small plate and snacks menu, I usually get their stuffed mushrooms (which are very good), sausage and ricotta pizza,  and beets with goat cheese salad. You could really just make a small meal from the items that they have on that menu and be able to splurge on more drinks and dessert. Is Cheesecake Factory worth coming to, I guess it all depends, but personally I'll stick with coming here for late night outings with my girls for drinks and a snack from their small plate menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=440

The service is always quite good, our waiter was charming, attentive and bothered to learn all the kids' names (I hardly care about other kids' names, so go him). The bill is always shockingly high, but I guess more shocking is the amount of food we always end up piling up. We always get the Pan seared Ahi-Tuna appetizer (so good) and today we got little salads (yum), crabcakes, and pizzatas (mushroom, yum). The kids got normal kid fare, though they could have used a crayon. Grand Lux at least has the Wiki Sticks, bring them over. Got two desserts for five people to share - the lemon cake was good but that 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake - whoo hoo!

The service in my opinion is half/half. There are times our server is very helpful and good but there are times we get stuck with a really bad service. The tables are always dirty and the chairs gets really sticky even after when they clean them. I have encountered so many dirty area under the tables and I hated it. I am a big fan of their bread and butter to start off before your entree'. Some of their food is good, but it all depends on what you like and what you don't like. I don't recommend any of their terriyaki dishes because none of them actually taste good. Just keep ordering what it's known for ""American food"". The location is in a good spot especially it's connected to the Galleria mall which is a plus to many.

My waiter felt the need to talk about my clothing options  (my shirt said coexist on it he didn't know what it meant), did his talk about specials, drinks and other things I didn't really care to hear and took forever. I ordered my drink and told him we were just grabbing some cheesecake and he seemed offended! Are you kidding me?!? IT'S THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! He brought our order and the bill at the same time and we never saw him again.

I've tried a new entree every time I come and I haven't found anything SPECTACULAR that makes me want to come again to fight traffic, and deal with parking and waiting and such.

Yes, I know its going to be expensive because of the location and blah blah blah, I'm not holding that against them. I'm just saying that's why I IN PARTICULAR do not care for the place that much.

He stated that the bread would be out shortly. Well ""shortly"" turned into 30 minutes! When we asked him about it, he stated that all the servers were in line to get bread and he wasn't able to get any. WTF! I found that hard to believe bc all of the servers around our table brought bread to their customers! So we didn't get any until we received our entrees. Next, I ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings and a peach Bellini. I guess ordering that was to much to ask bc I NEVER received my Bellini and when my food came out, it didn't include the onion rings. And to top it off, the burger came on a sourdough roll instead of a bun! The top of the bun was so crispy and burnt, there was no way I could eat it. I asked for a manager, however I did not want anything else from this establishment. I told them to take it all away.

Jeffrey C.,"Silicon Valley, CA",579,1013,915,3.0,1/5/2010,"Inspired by Edgar V.'s review, I figure I'd get around to posting my review of The Cheesecake Factory. Here it is: ""Gigantor Menu. Delicious Cheesecake."" Then, despired (making up words, natch) by this recent thread talk ( ), I now need to add something more substantial. Here it is: Gigantor Menu. Seriously, anything you can think of. Way too much, in fact. They do pretty much everything decently but nothing spectacularly. Kind of like Brendan Fraser, the Philadelphia Eagles, or BIC pens. Problem is, everything is way too overpriced. But you knew this already, because everyone knows what goes down at the Cheesecake Factory. My personal go-to is the chicken marsala, which costs something like eleventy dollars (note: eleventy is not a real number but is in fact a placeholder for an actual overpriced value). Delicious Cheesecake. But you knew this already, because the place is called freakin' ""The. Cheesecake. Factory."" They've got pretty much any type of cheesecake combination you can dream of: something sweet + cream cheese filling + crust = yum. So if you can't find anything you like, or don't like cheesecake, well, that's just un-American. Wait, that may be apple pie. Forgive the mistake. Problem is, the slices are way too overpriced (are you sensing a trend here)? My personal go-to is the Vanilla Bean. Simple yet magically delicious. This also costs eleventy dollars (I think it's actually like $6.50. Still ridiculous.). You'll definitely end up going at some point in your life. Don't look at the prices.

Well,  I'm not sure if my expectations have risen since my previous visits (which isn't so bad) or if this visit was especially bad, but I was left unimpressed and underwhelmed.  The food was not up to par with past experiences- I always order the same creamy pasta dish, and if I'm going to waste my day's calories on it, it better be luscious.  Here it was bland, lacking sauce and flavor.  I almost wanted to ask for a cup of sauce on the side, but shouldn't the pasta be edible when served?  The cheesecake was unfortunately not great either; creamy and rich, but lacking strong flavor. The icing on the (cheese)cake?  Horrible, absolutely terrible service.  I tend to over-tip and only consider a few things to be deal breakers, but our waiter hit every one of them.  First, only refilled my water once.  When the cup is 3/4 ice, I appreciate being checked on so my glass isn't empty- we were barely checked on, and I had to flag down random servers for water.  Second, completely inattentive; only asked us how everything was as he was dropping off the food- obviously I don't know how it is, I haven't touched my plate yet!  The worst, though, a random server brought the check with the plated cheesecake.  What?!  The worst thing you can do for service is bring the check before the patrons are finished eating.  In other cultures, you have to specifically request the check (instead of it being brought over) for that reason.  There goes your tip, and I won't consider the Cheesecake Factory for future dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=320

I must say that the first time I tried them, I thought they were amazing! Buuuuut... the second time I order them, it looked like the entree was cooked about 30 minutes ahead of time and then left under heat lamps. My beans were a dried and caked up lump and that was my big hint.  I am the type to let that kind of stuff go, however, because having cooked for large quanitities of people, I understand the stress of the kitchen. The food was still okay. The orange chicken on the other hand... My gums were tender at the time and that chicken was fried hard. Eating it hurt. It also looked like they drizzled sauce on as an after thought. Still, I give this place 4 stars because the cheesecake is always spot on and amazing. I like to go with a girlfriend and split an entree and dessert. That way, the both of us don't have to feel guilty about indulging... and hey!

Shoby A.,"Houston, TX",1,50,,1.0,10/22/2015,NEGATIVE. From the get go the hostess was rude but we let it slide. She told us we would have to wait and hour and a half for our table since we had 8 people. Fine no problem. But after that we see them seating people and parties of 5s and 6s and ok makes sense they can fit on a booth. But then we see them seating a party of 7 and I was like what? Especially cause they came way after us. So we spoke to the hostess and she said ok they're setting it up. Then 15 min go by and we asked another server and she was like well we are waiting for a party to leave so you can have that table. So that got me really upset cause seemed like they were giving us random answers. So I asked for the manager and he said oh yeah they say different things because it's just up to them how to pass the message about your table. That doesn't make sense what kind of training are they getting that they don't know how to tell people that your table isn't ready. Anyways finally get seated but one of my friends noticed that the hostess tells our server something. Then 15 min go by and the server tells us that I'll be right with you twice but doesn't come to us or ask us for water. Then he's like I'll be right back and my wife was like can we at least get some water right now cause we have been waiting for so long. And he walks away making a nasty face at us. Wish I would have gotten his name I want corporate to really check this location out cause I've read other reviews on here about the service here. Manager on the way out was kinda polite but we were done with this location. On top of that it was my twin cousin's bday. Any ways we called Kona Grill and they were so nice they took us.

Edgar V.,"Houston, TX",297,406,292,2.0,12/29/2009,"Cribbing some of David N's review, this place seemed to be a suitable choice for our annual company holiday lunch for 40 persons on a Friday.    We arrived at the opening time of 11 AM and things started out with us scattered throughout the first floor dining room - hardly conducive to the presentation part of the program.  This flaw was more pronounced as other lunchtime gangs arrived and added to the din of the kitchen, plate clearing, and general circus-like activity.  Needless to say, the range of those who actually heard the speeches was limited to the front 3 tables.  On second thought, perhaps those farther out would consider this ""cone of silence"" a good thing.  We'll call it a wash.* The meal itself was comprised of a carte d'hotel of an appetizer and entree, all presented on the most classic of classy presentations:  the fuzzy black-and-white bad copier sheet.  Dessert was off of the regular menu of about 3,000 iterations of cheesecake.  To her credit, our server (playing zone defense) was earning her pay by whipping out plates of calamari, onion rings, and spinach-and-artichoke dip between rounds of refills for the drinks.  I watched as her colleagues were a little more unenthusiastic about the pace. For my entree, I opted for the Navajo Chicken sandwich:  a fried bread stuffed with chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, celery, and some mayo derivative, which made the whole thing a colossal mess to eat.  I couldn't figure out where the ""Navajo"" part came into play - did they fry their bread?  Is mayo an indigenous food item for these noble folk? I had to unload some of the tomatoes and lettuce to expunge some of the offending mayo melange so I could eat some of this native goodness.  To sum, it was ""all right"". Splitting a dessert selection with my neighbor, we chose the banana cheesecake with fresh banana slices and whipped cream.  The cheesecake was forgettable and generically flavored - the fresh bananas were the most exciting part and ended up being fought over by me and my co-worker.  Make of that what you will. I can only surmise that convenience brings the masses here since the food is middling and the prices a bit steep for the value.  For the most part, the servers must have been court-ordered to repay society by working here since they seem devoid of cheer.  If you can do it, save your cash and sanity by going off of the ""reservation"" and eat elsewhere. * We can all be thankful that no rat fell from the ceiling during our visit like it did during Ako's trip here.  See her review for details.  I just wish we had read it before booking our trip here.  2.5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=380

As to be expected the restaurant was busy but we were willing to wait the short 15 minute wait. After being seated we only waited a few minutes before our waiter came over to greet us and take our drink order. I don't expect servers to be over the top friendly but this guy clearly did not want to wait on us. The water he brought my boyfriend had a piece of cheesecake in it! EW EW EWWWWWW! We had asked another server to replace the water for us, but he never bothered to ask if we were okay or apologized. We had completely lost our appetite and didn't bother eating our entree. Not to mention our entrees were not appetizing looking at all. My boyfriend and I both ordered salads and they looked as if they were sitting in the window for hours. The lettuce was browning and drowning in dressing. Our waiter was barley present at our table and checked on us only one time. I wanted to order cheesecake and my boyfriend was asking for a menu but I was so discouraged from the evenings service and food that I told our waiter to just bring the check, which he actually shrugged at us at the table at went off for the check. WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT NAMED AFTER CHEESECAKE DOESNT OFFER YOUR CUSTOMERS CHEESECAKE?? ON NATIONAL CHEESECAKE DAY?!! So he closed us out (tab was $62) and I tipped accordingly (18% even though he REALLY RELALY did not deserve it).  But it doesn't end there.... So I really really wanted cheesecake so I decided the night can be saved. I will stop by the cheesecake service area and order a cheesecake to go. I used a gift card to pay for dinner and apparently our waiter hadn't closed out the table so we had to wait for the cashier to call him over to close the tab so we could pay for our cheesecake. This guy had the nerve to come over and ask me if I had taken the check book. Um maybe if you were present at the table more often you would have known where it was. I left without the cheesecake. I won't be returning. For the price you can have a much much better dinner elsewhere.

However, their dinners fare much better.  I'm a big fan of their pizzas, and I'm usually not crazy about pizza in general.  I particularly enjoy their mushroom and chicken and goat cheese and vegetables pizzas.  Of course, there's really only one reason to go here, and that's the cheesecake.  There's a large variety of flavors, but my favorites are the chocolate- and fruit-based mixtures.  The drawback is that sometimes it doesn't taste like you're eating cheesecake in its pure form, which is a drawback for me because I like the specific flavor of cheesecake.  So I usually choose the mild flavors that don't interfere too much with cheesecake taste.  And if you don't like cheesecake, then choose another dessert.  When it comes to something sweet, you can't lose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=400

The unruly and dated animal house themed factory's service is coarse. These sloppy dressed performing jesters are either overworked, or they lack the enthusiasm to profit from providing a valuable service. The food my wife and I ordered was the straw that broke the elephant's back.   Our appetizer was an order of the Crispy Crab Wontons that was visually pleasant to describe the least and a distasteful wreck of over fried wonton noodles filled with mush at best.

Painfully, our dessert (strawberry cheesecake) tasted as though thawed for the 15 minutes we waited for its arrival.  Upon its entrance, this audience had mentally left this joke of a biz to run its circus act as my wife and I visually took in this Ringling Brothers atmosphere. -Esteban",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=420
Tuan L.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",425,343,884,3.0,1/12/2010,"I enjoy going to The Cheesecake Factory. Each time I go, the service is good and the food is satisfying. The menu is quite extensive, you just need to find a dish that you like. For me, it's the white chicken chili. I guess I'm drawn to it because it reminds me of the chili and rice I used to get in Cali, the only difference is TCF serves it with white chicken chili rather than regular chili. The complimentary bread is surprisingly good. It comes out warm and soft. And, who can forget the Cheesecake. I guess if you're called The Cheesecake Factory, you have to be known for it. I'm a old school guy, so I usually order the old fashion cheesecake with strawberries,never been too big on the other fancy types of cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=420

Tallon D.,"Houston, TX",5,7,,1.0,2/13/2011,"By definition, the Cheesecake Factory should have outstanding cheesecake, and it does. That being said, the food AND the service is not worth what the menu says it is. I ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich this time and I could have sworn I was eating a fast food sandwich. Not only that, but several errors occurred during the meal. First, the order was delayed for an unknown reason, prompting the manager to visit the table. Second, the waitress drops my fries when bringing my food. Not such a big deal since they offered to get me fresh ones. Third, they brought me BLUE CHEESE instead of mayo for my sandwich. I had already started spreading it on the top half of my bun by the time I had realized something was awry, but the manager offered to get me a fresh top bun for my sandwich. Fourth, I never received the onions I asked for when I initially ordered the sandwich. Fifth, on more than one occasion I had to call the waiter over to get a refill of water. Between all this, I feel overcharged for the quality of food and service I received. My advice, if you decide to go to The Cheesecake Factory, just stick to cheesecake. **UPDATE** It's official, this place gave me and my girlfriend food poisoning.

I hate that they have the gall to advertise within their menus. I don't care if you're located inside a mall or not. I will say that there are some very reasonably-priced wines by the glass, and I appreciate the smaller lunch portions being available on weekends.

Cj S.,"Denver, CO",58,19,1,1.0,2/13/2011,"I need to write more reviews.. so why not start it off with a bad one to get the juices flowing? Worst. Dining. Experience. Ever.  Main points before I rant? Good: There is food here. it comes out hot and their cheesecake is awesome. Bad: the cheesecake is the only thing you should come here for. Service sucks. OVERPRICED. I have been to 3 Cheesecake Factories: Sugar Land years ago when it opened (was okay), The Woodlands ( a couple years ago. did well for seating/serving our large party, but we had to sit outside in the cold with only some heaters working) aaaand this one. We put our name down at about 3:30, and finally sat down at 4. Never have I been to a restaurant so full during the slowest hours of the restaurant day. First off, it's pretty small as these places go. There's two stories and they way the seating is, it's not a favorable floor plan if the stairs are right in the middle. looks cool, but takes up a lot of space. The downstairs/main/valet entrance has no space for how many people have to wait. I guess you could stand around on the sidewalk if you had to. We always had to shift around when someone was passing by. The upstairs/mall entrance is a bit better, and there are more benches just outside to sit on, or you could line the long hallway. Our buzzer goes off, and the upstairs hostess informs us that we need to go the DOWNSTAIRS host stand to be seated. we do so. host informs us that table is being cleaned still... 10 minutes later and the table is JUST getting cleared off. Host sets places and we sit. Menu is huge - there is a huge poster outside the mall entrance of everything they serve. Quite daunting if you were as hungry as we were. Weird thing is, there were apparently 2 menus with no obvious labels of their differences until you saw one had more options (I think one was lunch and the other dinner) and one is full (every other page) of advertisements. 10 MORE minutes later and we finally get a waiter to take our drink & appetizer order and to request some bread. probably another 10 minutes until our drinks come, though he's standing around talking to one table while holding our and our neighboring table's drinks for a few minutes. Aren't you supposed to drop off all the drinks, and if one table is ready to order, say 'let me drop these off' and I'll come back? He was taking so long I was contemplating just getting up and taking our drinks off his tray since he was standing 5 feet away. So recap if you're still with me: we have been waiting about an hour for any food or drink.. still no bread and that's supposed to come with your drinks, or shortly thereafter. Our appetizer finally comes. spinach artichoke dip with little bowls of pico and sour cream. decent, nothing special or horrible. Still no bread, though he brings the couple beside us their bread. They were seated after us. Food comes - WITH the bread! We had specifically asked for it first because we were really hungry. okay, whatever, our food is here. One friend asks for ketchup. Waits well over 5 minutes for it, and our drinks have not been refilled this whole time. They're all half ice, and with the appetizer we've sucked them down already. Friend calls over manager to complain. We feel kinda bad but... this is really slow. Ridiculously so. Other friend seems to be enjoying her greek salad and avocado eggrolls. My chicken carbonara was underseasoned, and I had to pay an extra $2.50 for a measly chicken breast. The pasta was okay, but maybe I'm just getting too critical. In my opinion, DEFINITELY NOT worth what I paid, which was over $15. The dish shouldn't have cost more than maybe 12 total. So now the manager and the waiter have combined their efforts and it probably equaled to about 1 lackluster server. We finish and we had explained at the beginning of the meal that we wanted to split the dip 3 ways, and then the rest of the ticket billed to each person, respectively. He had to ask again. Took over 10 minutes to split it. We get the books back and he hadn't even run already peeved friend's card, and put the other friend's ticket with his card. Then we had to wait for him to do that... it's 5PM at this point. took this long without wine/dessert?! FINALLY we left. I vow to never return here for a meal. Maybe only if they ever get that Toblerone cheesecake again.. and I'll eat it at the bar to take it to go. Horrible - and not even on a busy night! And this was not an isolated incident.. the other 2 tables beside us had the same time-laden service as well. The first couple wanted to get dessert, but the waiter was taking so long they couldn't wait any longer and asked for their bill after they only had an appetizer. The other table was agreeing with us. And we wished the new couple who sat down before we left luck with a more expedited service. They were already growing restless and they didn't even have food yet. For a high dollar clientele between lunch and dinner service... this was simply AWFUL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=360

Saint O.,"Houston, TX",29,128,17,5.0,2/21/2011,"Went here this past Saturday night for dessert, following a not so 5-star meal at Pico's Mex Mex.   First things first, we obviously wanted dessert, because when we arrived shortly after 9 p.m., there was a 30 minute wait.  We all know that a 30 minute wait for The Cheesecake Factory is fairly decent.  The upside is, if the wait is too too bad, you can always go shopping in the high end stores, encased inside The famous Galleria Mall, where this restaurant is located.   We were seated, and our waiter came right over.  I have nothing negative to say about him other than the fact that he told us  redundantly three times that he'd only worked there a year.  Guess people at the table, including myself uttered things that seemed different on the menu, to which he followed up with his, ""It's been the same since i've been here and i've been here for a year"" speech.  Giggles. Anyway, we all pretty much ordered cheesecakes.  I of course only order the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake.  I must say this is by far the best dessert/cheesecake on their menu.  It will cost you about $7.50, to which i thought it was closer to $10, and when i asked the waiter was he sure, he replied, ""for the year i've been working here it has always been this price"".  LOL.  Needless to say that aside from that, he was very attentive, polite, knowledgeable, and friendly to all 6 of us.  I ended up ordering my dessert to go, and didn't indulge until yesterday.  I can say that if you do not want an entire slice, you may be better off not ordering this here.  Barnes & Noble has the same slice, just a smaller version, and if you have a discount card, you can get it for less than $5.  Food for thought.  However, if you do want the size the 'Factory offers, then it's well worth every penny.   I also ordered the strawberry lemonade.  I have to say that they have the best lemonade i've ever had...hands down.  I do not agree with the whooping $4.50 price tag, it can easily go for $2.50, and you guys (managers if you're reading) will make just as much profit, if not more on it.  What the beep, i ordered it anyway.   All in all, you get what you pay for and this place is well worth it.  Indeed, The Cheesecake Factory will always be one of my top five places to dine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=360

A big group of us ladies decided to convene here for a pre-Free Hugs brunch. Getting a large table is quite a wait but the place was bustling with Miss Teen Americas, chic international socialites and last minute Christmas shoppers. I think we waited about 45 minutes. It was worth the wait because our server was very attentive and made no hassle about doing split checks for us. We had a nice little table on the side of the stairs so despite the hustle and bustle surrounding us, we were quite relaxed.  Everyone seemed pleased with their food. I had the sweet corn fritters and the avocado egg rolls. The corn fritters were sweet and fluffy. They tasted like something you'd get at a carnival and I love carnival food :) The avocado egg rolls were spicy and PACKED with avocado, onions, peppers and spices. I tasted a bit of my friend's Chipotle Pasta and it was delicious! Smoky, spicy goodness. They have generous portions here so if you're not starving I'd order an appetizer, snack or lunch portion. The regular portions are enough to gorge yourself and still have some to take for lunch the next day.  I always love the grandiose, over the top décor of the Cheesecake Factory.

Preston I.,"Houston, TX",321,88,113,5.0,12/24/2017,"Came here for a late Christmas Eve brunch. I really appreciate the feel of this restaurant. It's casual yet well put together at the same time.  I ordered the egg roll sampler and the chicken samosas. They're both technically appetizers, but together they were more than enough for me. The sampler is basically one of each of their egg rolls. The cool part is that they let you trade one out for a roll that you enjoy more, so I traded the Cuban egg roll for another Tex Mex. it was a great decision. The rolls were delicious, and they paired well with the sauces that accompanied them. You get four large egg roll for $11. The samosas were also super good. You get four good-sized ones for $7.  My sister got enchiladas with black beans, and she seemed to like it a lot. My mom ordered the pineapple chicken and shrimp wth rice. She doesn't like eating out that much, but she said that she enjoyed the meal. The service was the best part of the outing. Our waitress, Alexis, was amazing! She had a great, amicable personality and was very helpful. She kept the free bread coming as well and checked on us often. Definitely one of the best servers I've ever encountered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston
Carmen W.,"Houston, TX",123,131,163,1.0,1/2/2018,"Want to hear a funny, but really not funny review? Want to experience the hilarity of this review? Just go the Cheesecake Factory Galleria location!  My mom and I decided to meet one day for lunch here. It's a rare occasion, so we were pretty excited about the time to spend enjoying lunch. I got to the restaurant first, and pretty early. I was sitting outside the restaurant in the small waiting area and a manager (I got his name, and I want to say that it was David, but *disclaimer* that might be totally incorrect, however that is what I will call him for the sake of this review. Either way, he was bald, about 5'11"", and light skinned with an accent.) approached me and asked me ""can I help you?"" Sort of arrogantly. I said ""no"" just as arrogantly back. He looked at me like he was offended, and I thought to myself, ""well, I'd be offended too."" But I kept that thought to myself and told him ""I'm waiting on someone."" While I was waiting, I noticed there was a gift card promotion going on - buy a gift card, get a free cheesecake. I approached the host stand to ask about it, but all I was able to say was ""I have a question about the gift card promotion."" Before the hostess cut me off, and pointed to the to go counter and said ""Gift cards that way."" And went back to tapping away on her little host screen.  I begrudgingly went to the to go counter and got my answer about the gift cards, went back outside to sit, and waited for my mom. Once she got there, we went inside and were greeted by a much nicer hostess who walked us to our table.  Our server, Tony, came and greeted us after a few minutes of us sitting there. He was a good server, I want to emphasize that. It wasn't his fault about what happened next.  He brought us butter and bread. Frozen butter. And cold bread. We were cool with the cold bread, but my mom couldn't handle the frozen, unspreadable butter so she sent it back. When tony returned with the 2nd butter, it too, was frozen. She handed him back the butter, and the 3rd time he brought it, it was finally melted enough to spread. Then my mom received her coke. She could tell by tasting it that it was Diet Coke. She pulled Tony aside and asked him why he'd brought her a Diet Coke, and he said ""how can you tell?!"" Wow. Anyways, he went to the kitchen and came back a few minutes later to apologize to her and explained that ""someone"" in the kitchen had switched the connections between the coke nozzle and Diet Coke nozzle but that it was being fixed. He brought her a new coke once the machine was corrected. It was flat. 100% broke-down, on the side of the road, flat.  We called over the manager, David, and he seemed like we disturbed him from his very busy shift. He nodded and acted interested while my mom told him about our experience thus far. He didn't apologize, he made excuses. While we was making excuses to my mom, I was observing him, and I noticed something strange: he had on a rubber bracelet- the kind that are given out at events with words printed on them. His said in big bold white letters ""Don't be a little b*tch!!!""  I interrupted his excuses and said to him ""Nice bracelet."" I've never seen someone go so rigid and panicky as they came to the realization of their error. He slowly reached down to this wrist and turned the bracelet inside out. He nodded and remained speechless for the first time in minutes. I told him I'd once worked in the restaurant industry for quite some time, and that his behavior and presentation was completely unacceptable. He asked me ""oh yeah? What restaurant?"" Again, no apologies. He changed the subject to something that was irrelevant, and then he excused himself from the table.  At the end of our meal, when Tony dropped off the check, I put my debit card in the check presenter. David came by quickly, took my debit card out, slid it towards me, and said ""Sorry it didn't go so well today."" And as he was walking off refusing to make eye contact with me, I heard him mutter ""maybe next times better."" I'm sorry, but paying for my food doesn't make me forget about the bracelet or the experience. This review needs to be seen by corporate, and that manager needs to be reprimanded and written up. That's all there is to say about that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston
Joe C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",99,619,139,4.0,12/24/2017,"I should hate the Cheesecake Factory. The food is the absolute epitome of corporate chain fare, the atmosphere is perfect for where you're most likely to find them - in or next two a major shopping mall - and you will never encounter a cocktail that hasn't been carefully planned and focus-tested at the bar. But when you have a waiter as enthusiastic as ours who does such a good job, and the rest of the place holds up its end of the bargain ... I just can't help it. I can justify it under the mediocrity principle,* since one of the reasons chains became popular in the first place is poor quality control among independent restaurants in the pre-McDonald's era. If you have never been to a Cheesecake Factory, you'll probably think it's fine, and if you're a return customer, you already know if you'll like it or not. This is an excellent Cheesecake Factory judged on its own terms, and the staff are great. I'll vote for a million other spots in Houston, but I'll say yes every time someone else wants to come here. * ref.

Their take on simple dishes from fish tacos to gumbo to simple Chinese inspired dishes are just overwhelming in flavor and not in a good way. Either it's intensely salty or another extreme. I had the crispy chicken and shrimp in pineapple sauce today and it was just way too strong in flavor. My sister and I ordered the same dish and she couldn't even bring herself to take more than 3 bites. Asked if she wanted it to go and she said ""if I didn't like it here I'm not going to like it at home.""  Also our waitress was talking and cursing at about something behind us.

April J.,"Falls Church, VA",1,57,8,3.0,1/13/2018,"I'm finding that in Texas everything has some type of pepper / spicy flavor when I don't expect it.  I ordered two eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast around noon on a Saturday.  I expected the potatoes to be flavored, but my normal, plain scrambled eggs (not an omelet) had small chunks of green peppers? It was like whatever omelet or fried item was prepared on the griddle before my food wasn't properly cleaned off or was stirred into the eggs?

The food is super tasty and You can pretty much create whatever type of dish that you want to create.

You can enter the restaurant from the second floor of the mall or you can park outside the mall and walk directly into the restaurant. The only parking next to the restaurant are Valet Parking or pay meter.  Me and a co worked came to enjoy a little lunch after helping volunteer at the George R Brown center during hurricane Harvey!  You can always count on this place not being overly crowded for lunch and being able to enjoy a great conversation with some really cool friends or family.   I'm a pasta lover and the Cheesecake Factory is the boss of all pastas!!!  I normally order the Cajun Jambalaya but I order the Louisiana Cajun Chicken pasta!!  It was delicious I'm not a big fan of really spicy foods but the Cajun pastas here seems to be more Cajun spice rub more so than a spicy sauce..   The Louisiana Cajun pasta was not spicy but did have a little kick not too much.  It comes with diced peppers (yellow and green) sautéed and mushrooms I order my pasta without the mushrooms because of food allergy. None the less it was perfect the chicken was lightly fried with a bit of crispy batter and the chicken was not dry at all.   My meal was great, and my Pineapple Mojito was so good and just right!!! My only flaw and I'll make sure to tell my waiter the next time please! light on the mint!!!!

After the server took my order at the walk up register, we stood to the side watching them work and noticed that instead of packing up our cheesecakes, the server/cashier just stood around waiting for someone else to come up and order.  I get that there is an assigned person to pack up the stuff, but if you see that everyone else is busy, how about lend a hand and pack up some of your to-go orders so they don't have to wait so long. I'm pretty patient, but if I see you standing around doing nothing while I'm waiting for you to fulfill my order, that's going to annoy me a little. Also, I watched her as she realized we hadn't gotten our order yet, and it had been over 20 minutes.  She proceeded to fill the order herself, but as she did that, I saw that she licked her finger and used that to grab the wax/tissue paper that they use to grab the cheesecake from their trays. I'm trying not to think about how there's contamination on my cheesecake since we waited so long and had to pay extra for parking just to get the stuff.

Cheesecake factory is almost the same everywhere with decoir and food consistency, so I can really only differentiate with service here. Service could have improved for sure. Twice I asked for a warm batch of new bread, that took an extra 20 minutes to get to me and wasn't even warm (though he said it was ""fresh from the oven"") :( I have waited tables in my past experiences so I don't usually harp on trivial things, but the butter wouldn't even melt on my bread LOL. We didn't get checked on or water refills -- which just confused me because it was past rush hour. Ended up staying here around 2.5 hours for dinner at 7:30 partially because it took so long to get our food.

Sarah M.,"Houston, TX",54,164,231,3.0,7/16/2017,"Spouse and I had some errands to run at the Galleria, so we decided to grab dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. We have only been here together once since chain restaurants are not our jam. However, it was a pleasant dinner. Ambience-the lighting is low and warm. We were seated on a booth with other tables adjoining, but there are solo booths available. Bread is complimentary, and the brown bread is a winnerThe menu is giant. Massive. Enormous. We opted to split some small plates, which was PLENTY for two grown adults. The chicken samosas arrived first. They were flavorful and crisp. The accompanying sauce was tasty as well. Cuban egg rolls came next-they were not my fave. The mustard sauce was thin and the egg roll itself was not cohesive. But it was fine. Nashville nuggets were another small plate we sampled. They are not anything brand new-just chicken nuggets with hot sauce or Buffalo sauce. But they were tasty. The dish in last place was the truffle cheese sticks (bacon truffle cheese sticks? Something like that). Avoid. It was just grease. Flavorless grease. ""Flavorless Grease"" is a great name for a band. Terrible when it describes your food. So overall, our small plates were fine. What brings this review up to 3 stars were the speedy and attentive service as well as the cheesecake. Red Velvet cheesecake. So light, so delicious. Absolutely worth it.

We ordered fried Mac & cheese (~$11-12) as an appetizer. It took a little while but we weren't complaining since we were catching up. The manager stopped by to apologize about the wait and explained they had cooked one less than what was suppose to be delivered so they'll have it out in just a moment. Very soon after, 4 perfectly fried Mac & cheese balls were delivered. They were awesome! For our main course, we both ordered from the lunch menu. He had grilled salmon which came with mashed potatoes and broccoli ($15.50). He said it was good. I ordered the miso salmon which comes with rice but asked to sub it out with mashed potatoes ($15.50). It was great! I really enjoyed my miso salmon because it had a sweetness to it. I highly recommend it and will order it again. I could only eat 1/3 of it because I was full after the bread and 1 fried Mac ball. Packed it up because I don't waste food. I highly recommend the red velvet cheesecake but my friend wanted the Reese's cheesecake, so we ordered that to go for him because you can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake! Plus it was his birthday, and his first visit to CCF ever. When the check came, I was surprised to see how they had comped our fried Mac & cheese balls. Total was $43. Hadn't been to CCF in years, and I forgot how tasty they were. Looking forward to my next visit. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=20

The ahi tuna tataki salad and chopped chicken salad were both fair to good.  I enjoyed the brown bread they served with the meal and I am not a bread person at all, so that's saying a lot.

Julienne T.,"Houston, TX",314,78,596,4.0,7/18/2017,"I frequent this location because I am closer to this area than the others. My favorite dishes are the Thai lettuce wrap and the Pasta Da Vinci. The Thai lettuce wrap comes with about 6 pieces of chicken, some veggies, and 3 different sauces. I usually order the Pasta Da Vinci because I like how the flavors are not too bold and it comes with mushrooms. Service is consistent most of the time. There's usually a long wait during the weekend, which is understandable. If you're coming from the inside of the Galleria Mall, it's much easier than coming in the main entrance. By entering the main entrance, you have to climb a set of stairs before you are able to do anything. The restroom is also located downstairs so make your pit stop before you walk back downstairs if you're coming from the front (or just go when you leave). Parking is usually a hassle because you have shoppers and customers from other restaurants parked in the same garage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=20

Michelle B.,"Houston, TX",399,264,319,4.0,1/27/2016,"The Skinny Chopped Salad and the service I received here on my last visit have made this place more of a 4 than a 3 for me. I absolutely adore that they have a skinny menu, and their chopped salad is plentiful and delicious and for less than 600 calories. I seriously do not see how you can go wrong. The price is a bit steep for a salad, but I seriously crave this one and their dressing. And since we're being good, we can splurge on a slice (or 3) of the pumpernickel bread. Onto the service, the last time I came I was out to lunch with my team, and we were in a rush. My supervisor ordered the salmon, my co-worker a pasta dish, and I of course ordered my salad. When the pasta and salad came out, the waiter told us that the salmon was not placed due to a mistake in the back, but he apologized profusely and offered to bring her a soup to keep her waiting. She agreed and took the tortilla soup, and after this, the manager stopped by to also apologize and make sure she got something to eat while she was waiting. She enjoyed the tortilla soup, and the salmon came not too long after, and the waiter knew we were in a rush so he brought us all to-go containers and bags ahead of time. Every restaurant has mistakes happen, and Cheesecake Factory demonstrated EXACTLY how every restaurant should handle every mistake and delay in service to keep customers happy and coming back. I'll happily be back, although it's worth noting that this, like all stores in the Galleria, gets super crowded at peak times, so plan accordingly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=60

Since this was my first time in Houston, I was feeling a little down, so Cam suggested we grab a late night bite to eat somewhere in the mall. I typically get the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, but I really wanted rice and chicken, so Cam and I opted to share the Cashew Chicken with Rice, which was awesome. It was a bit too salty, but it definitely encouraged us to drink more water, which our waitress refilled constantly. This restaurant spans across two floors, so I was a little confused when we walked in and there was no one in the restaurant. Turns out everyone was upstairs. The wait was a bit long, but they also seemed a bit understaffed in the front. Since we didn't really have anything else to do, we didn't mind the wait - it gave me a chance to drool over the cheesecake displays.

Melba M.,"Houston, TX",1,24,9,1.0,11/17/2016,"STAY AWAY!!!! By far one of the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have EVER had.  For starters, today was my mother's birthday, so we decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory to celebrate.  That was our first mistake: 1. It took over 15 minutes for our waitress to greet us at the table. 2. My mother's food was not hot when it arrived at the table.  The salmon was dry, the mashed potatoes had been sitting out for so long that they were no longer soft, and had turned a yellow/brown color. 3. It took another 15 minutes for our waitress to return so that my mother could select a different dish. 4. We ask for a manager - it took the manager, Chris, over 10 minutes to come to our table.  I remember the time because I intentionally checked because it took so long.  When we asked our waitress why it was taking so long, she said ""the managers are all having a meeting with the new shift.""  Umm..ok?  I have never heard of a manager at a restaurant being unavailable when a patron asks to speak with one. 5. Manager finally arrives and my mother places a new order.  We order our dessert (remember, it is her birthday and BOTH this manager, Chris AND our waitress knew). 6. Dessert arrives.  No candle.  No ""happy birthday"" on the plate.  No song.  We ask our waitress if they still sing to guests at the table, and she says, and I QUOTE ""Oh, we still sing, but we only do it for certain tables... sometimes we don't want to disturb other guests.. But I always do it for my guests..""  ... Umm.. awkward?  So we are not your guests?  Are we not deserving?  Also, this was about 4pm, and there were maybe 3 people seated in our section. 7. We call a manager over again.  Takes Chris the same 10-15 minutes to arrive.  He proceeds to tell us what he would NOT do (i.e. comp our horrible dinner).  We end up ARGUING with the manager about our horrible experience (because there are plenty more details, such as old coffee, tea, cold food, no water refills, OVER CHARGED for things my mother sent back, poor service all around).   I have NEVER been to a restaurant where a manager argues with a patron about the experience they had at their restaurant.  I will NEVER, EVER take ANYONE to The Cheesecake Factory again.  I will NEVER recommend going there.  Absolutely deplorable service, and an even more awful dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=60

They crammed the five of us into an awkwardly shaped table on the end of a curved half-booth that wasn't even big enough for four people.  We were cramped and service was slow, even though the restaurant didn't seem that crowded.  The server had little interest in taking care of us in a timely manner.  The food came out hot and tasted just fine, but the experience as a whole was just plain bad.  He ended up adding gratuity to the bill, probably because he knew we were pissed off and wouldn't be tipping well after the terrible service we received.  We were going to argue the added gratuity, but just paid it and decided that we'd never come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=60

Also, we had to stack plates when finished and still the servers dropping food off did not pick them up - at edge of table. Had to wait for our server to finally come back (happened 3x) - which was not soon enough to ask for more sauce for the chicken dish bc food was eaten by the time he checked on us. Servers seem to have the ""not my table, not my  problem"" attitude. We needed water refills when entrees dropped off, but they were gone before we could ask.  We waited about 25 minutes for our entrees. They brought out the wrong entree for one of the four of us. She then had to wait another 25 minutes for her food. By the time it arrived we had all finished eating. She also requested the lunch portion, but was charged for the dinner portion.  I give our server the benefit of the doubt bc they seemed busy (keep in mind though, it was 4pm on a Sunday).

For starters, the wait time to get seated was about 20 minutes, and between getting seated and receiving our food, we probably waited another hour, which wasn't ideal. Moreover, the Tomato Basil Pasta I had was pretty disappointing. It came with grilled chicken and mozzarella, but in very small pieces and quantity. Instead of pairing with the pasta, I felt that the chicken and mozzarella pieces were drowning in a sea of bland penne and diced tomatoes. Again, the portion size was absolutely massive (I barely ate half of the dish), but bigger is not better if the flavour isn't there.  Luckily, their strawberry cheesecake saved the day! It was creamy, rich, and as delicious as I imagined it would be. The strawberries and whipped cream on top complemented it really well and made for a decadent dessert. If dinners had MVPs, this would be it.  In all honesty, I probably won't be coming back here again for their entrees.

We asked several times to 3 people at least about our bread.  It finally arrived 1 hour later at 8pm, after I first ordered it from our server.  Freakin 1 hour!!!  Is there a bread shortage in this restaurant or did our server want a smaller tip??

My friend ordered the American hamburger and fries and would order it again so I guess 4 stars for that entree.   I got a slice of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake to go also...4.5 star.   They had 2 large cases of cheesecakes of all different kinds from basic to very unique.  They also had about 3 10"" tall cakes if you wanted a large slice of cake. The menu is still large with so many apps and entrees to please just about everyone.  If you need to charge your phone there is no plug available in the bar area.  There was one available on our floor in another area but you would need at least a 4 ft extension cord.  Just FYI.   We had to wait to pay also.  It started getting real annoying because it was going on 3 hours.  Whenever I go to a Cheesecake Factory the food has always been real good but the servers are almost always slow or disorganized.

The biscuits were harder than Thor's hammer, and just as tasty while the chicken was bland (at least it was juicy and hot).

The food is overall good, it's usually a lively scene and service is good.  I first stumble across the CF when I was a 10 years old. I remember what I ordered, too. I had the Thai lettuce wraps for an app and the Jamaican black shrimp for an entree. (Yes, I was fancy). And now that I am 21*** I still love this place and frequent with family and friends. My favorite apps are the avocado rolls, the aforementioned Thai lettuce wraps, and I use to enjoy the pot stickers-when it was on the menu. My favorite entrees are the Jamaican black shrimp, any of the pasta dishes, and the baked salmon. My favorite dessert is the always dependable strawberry cheesecake and the sweet and velvety red velvet cheesecake. mmm, boy! Now, I'm keeping my review at 5 stars but, I have to admit, I've had some bad meals here and there. But this is not high class fine dining, and I've had many more good meal experiences than bad.

I told her we were ready for starters, we ordered the artichokes that took forever to arrive and were burnt to a black crisp. We didn't complain and waited for our entrees. I ordered the scampi and steak Diana. I thought it came with noodles but instead it was just 3 shrimp soaked in a white sauce covering half the plate.  Its my fault for not asking if it did or didn't have noodles. But the server didn't know either once i did ask. So I ordered some angel hair on the side to add to my plate of sauce. By the time the noodles arrived my bf was finished eating and my excitement to ever eat here again had vanished. It took forever! She brought it with a side of the scampi sauce obviously made by another cook because it was a completely different color. My bf only ate his strip steak and mashed potatoes but not his green beans because they were Raw. When we walked out I finally saw a manager hanging by the stairs chatting it up with a server.

With that aside, our server was wonderful.  He was very attentive, but never intrusive.  I ordered a grilled salmon which was very good.  He didn't charge me for my extra side of asparagus -- which winded up being a good thing because they were semi-overdone anyway.  After about 15 minutes of dining, there was a server change of shift and I was afraid that the continuity of service would be lacking, but our next server was just as great. Our booth was located next to where all the other servers congregate and they were very unprofessional speaking loudly and cursing -- typical teenage behavior.  I was already feeling miserable sweating to death, so being forced to listen to them was just icing on the cake.

Steph D.,"Houston, TX",26,108,6,1.0,7/19/2016,"Did not want to come here but BF had a gift card. (sigh) Closest location was the Galleria so after plumbing the depths of the parking garage and navigating the non-functional mall escalators we made our way to the restaurant. We came here specifically for burgers cause it was Monday and I wanted to go to Pub Fountains for the three-dollar burger special but funny how things work out. So our waiter shows up for a few seconds, leaves. Shows up, leaves. Shows up, leaves. Keeps doing this, he's running off to wait on the 2 tables next to us. Finally comes to take our order, we start ordering just as the runners bring the food to the table next to us. We're mid sentence he's like ""just a second"" and leaves us for the other table. By this time we're like WTF? So finally he comes back says ""Do you want to order?"" I'm like (facepalm) Now I cannot eat rare hamburger because when I was growing up my mother nibbled at the raw hamburger while cooking and as a result, got a tapeworm which completely turned me off raw hamburger for the rest of my life. And something I've struggled with for decades is places that try to cook hamburgers like steak - they always always always fail to get the desired result because hamburger Is Not Steak. (unless it's a high-end restaurant and their hamburgers are inch-and-a-half thick ground sirloin). (and is anyone as old as me and remembers when Chili's only served hamburgers and would **only** cook them medium-rare?) So I say I want it cooked until no longer pink but... and he cuts me off and goes ""well done"". And I go (facepalm). We go round and round with me trying to cancel the burger 4 or 5 times and him ignoring my requests and finally going off to find the cook for me to talk to. It's not the cook that shows up but a manager who asked what the problem was. I tell her I want the burger cooked until no longer pink but still juicy and she goes ""well done"" and I go (facepalm). I ask her to cancel the hamburger which she actually does. BF's burger comes, he ordered it medium-rare, no bun, it comes medium with a bun, no condiments. I testily snap ""Do Not Send It Back."" He cuts it in half, shares it with me. Waiter shows back up, puts the check on our table we're like WTF? Picks the check up after BF snarls at him. I had gotten no sleep the night before so I was extremely fragile and snarky as well. Exceedingly snarky. Waiter comes back, clears the table. I would have gone (facepalm) but I had part of a hamburger in my hand and no dishes on the table. We speculate  the reason he's showing up more often at our table is probably cause the other 2 tables have left. The only good thing about this is we didn't pay for anything because of the gift card. Next time I'll tell BF ""fuck the gift card and take me to Pub Fountains"". Afterthought edit: They handled the stupid hamburger issue all wrong. Instead of arguing with me over it, the waiter should have just cancelled it first time I asked, brought me the menu and offered the suggestion ""see if there's anything else here you'd rather have.""  And I probably would have.

Didn't even say sorry! I usually don't get upset over these type of things but this location took a nose dive and went down a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=100
Manuel E.,"Pearland, TX",398,118,93,4.0,8/3/2016,"I wish I could give The Cheesecake factory four and a half stars.  It deserves more than a four, but not necessarily a five.  The Cheesecake Factory is an excellent restaurant chain.  There is a very nice atmosphere, created by the dim lighting, which also causes a romantic feel.  There is very good service as well.  While you are waiting for your meal, they serve you fresh, warm bread.  My favorite is probably the Rye... that's the brown one right? lol.  Just a hint: if you are going to order a main entree, plan on getting about three meals out of it.  Personally, I go for an appetizer, which is one or two meals.  My favorite is the fried macaroni and cheese.  You are served four breaded and fried balls of macaroni and cheese on a chunky marinara.  When you plunge your fork into the ball, you will find lots of white cheddar cheese and macaroni. I have tried so many things on this menu and I have NEVER been disappointed. I'm usually not all that experimental but Cheesecake Factory has gotten me out of my old habits! If you're a Veggie... they make some of the best salads I have ever had.  If I want a salad for a meal (which is rare) the first place I think of is Cheesecake, hands down.  My personal favorite is the Luau Salad.  I am also rather fond of the Chicken Tostada Salad.   This place makes some damn good cheesecake with about 20 available selections.  I guess that's what they are named for.  A fail-proof order is the fresh strawberry - it's a classic.  Dulce de Leche, though I feared might be too sweet, but divine - rich without being overpowering.  However, I almost feel that they got a little zealous with their combinations.  Some of those cheesecakes really never had to be made.  German chocolate cheesecake?  Boston cream cheesecake?   At the end of your enjoyable meal... they bring you the bill....  Although it isn't too bad, it's still pricey.  Normally, the wait is about 45 minutes.  If you get there early or on a weekday, you may be seated immediately.  This place is a must-try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=100

When we initially sat down the place was packed. 30 minutes passed and we still had not gotten our order. We put in a complaint and 30-40 minutes later the food comes out when I notice my burger is well done instead of medium well so I have to return it. At this point everyone who sat after us were already gone. Waited another 25 minutes and the burger finally came out but at this point I did not want it anymore so I returned it.

Mai Shoua V.,"Saint Paul, MN",13,1,1,1.0,11/18/2016,"Ok.. I don't write reviews and I like going to The Cheesecake Factory but this one... oh my lord. My fiance and I came in and got seated right away, our waitress greeted us and took down our drink orders and went on her way. Sitting next to us were 2 women who seemed to be having a problem with what they had ordered and I'm guessing the manager or whatever was helping them out (the same lady who brought us to our seats, so maybe she was the host?) We got our drinks and my fiance had finished his and was given a refill by our waitress who just kind of plopped it on the table and left. 10 minutes go by and I'm sitting there hungry waiting for that magical complimentary bread and butter to show up and it doesn't, another 10 minutes go by and our waitress walks by us and doesn't even stop to let us know if our food is almost ready yet or not. So by this time the 2 ladies who were next to us had already left and a new group of people came in. (one of them didn't even finish their food because something was wrong so she ordered a dessert to go, it came on a plate and she had to tell them she was getting it to go... manager/host did a goof job there. *sarcastic* and yes I was eavesdropping cause there was no bread and butter to catch my attention) my fiance sees the lady who was dealing with the 2 ladies before and asks if we can get some bread and she says yes she'll get some. We see her walk to the place where they're cooking, thinking she or someone would bring us some but nope. So 20 minutes have gone by and no bread, another 5 minutes have gone by and we see the lady walking around and still no bread or news about our food. And my patience just drops waaaayy down and I see a guy at the desk area and I tell him that we've been sitting for over 20 minutes with no bread and we have no idea when our food will be out or where our waitress is and he says he'll get her right away. So I sit down, she's taking drink orders from the new group of people next to us and comes over and says ""what did you want?"" And i said ""oh, i just wanted some bread"" and she says she'll go get some. Like wtf....what about my food. So bread comes and a few minutes the food comes out too. I got the shrimp scampi and steak diane combo thingy and it comes with mash potatoes and it's $21.95 or something. PEOPLE IT IS NOT WORTH IT! i got 3 little pieces of meat mixed with shiitake mushrooms and onion, 3 shrimps (shouldn't the shrimp scampi have some sort of pasta at the very least?) And i got a whole not fully cooked potato in my mashed potatoes, my fork barely cut through. My food was cold but after all that waiting I was just happy there was some sort of food in front of me. I did ask our waitress to get me another side of mashed potatoes and I was like... if she charges me for this I will explode. But at least the burger my fiance got was good. I ordered a slice of chocolate cake to go cause i didn't want to be there any longer, and when i opened to eat it in the car it was this thin slice. In conclusion I'm never going here again.

I should have trusted my instincts. It was absolutely one of the worst food experiences again. I ordered a skinny vegetable salad with chicken. My friend ordered a Tuna Tatiki appetizer. Both look tired and of extremely poor quality. My salad was not per the menu. No roasted beet, but added celery and corn. The lettuce was dark and brown, the apple chunks were brown also. I asked the over-worked waiter and he told me on 3 occasions that the manager would be over. After 15 minutes had passed, I stood up to find the manager at the host table assigning tables. Is that his job? I tried to attract his attention, but after 5 minutes back in my seat, no sign of the manager. The waiter offered us to cover my meal and a free cheesecake slice (which I didn't want as I had just ordered a salad). We finally got up and left without paying.

Then we waited 30 min for our food and one of the orders came out wrong so we had to wait another 15 min to get the right dish (they told us it'd only take 2-3min to fire up the right pasta). They did recognize that we waited a looong time and gave us one dish and a dessert for free, so I do give them props for that.

For my entree I selected the Mediterranean falafel salad with chicken and was very disappointed but could not send it back for another dish because at this point we were late to our next activity.

Brandon W.,"Phoenix, AZ",127,12,6,4.0,2/3/2015,"Let me start by saying Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants.  I've eaten here soooo many times, and I've never gotten tired of it.  The building itself is inside the mall, so you can park at any of the garages and walk to it.  It has an entrance on the 2nd floor, and another entrance on the 1st floor (which is where the bar is).  Since it IS in the galleria, good luck finding parking on the weekends. This place gets pretty packed around lunch and dinner time so you will have to wait, especially if you have large parties.  The waiting area can get pretty crowded too, so go at off hours if you want to avoid the chaos. If you're new to this place, you'll be surprised at the sheer number of items on the menu.  On top of that, they will give you complementary bread & butter.  As far as  the appetizers here, its all pretty good.  Except for a few things, such as the ""vietnamese shrimp summer rolls.""  That stuff's pretty cold and bland. Don't know what to choose for lunch or dinner?  The pasta & burger/sandwiches are always a good choice, not to mention the size of the portions (they are VERY big).  If you come during lunch time, you can get a ""lunch special"" of certain items, such as the pasta.  It's a smaller size portion, but to be honest it's still quite a lot of food.  Overall, most of the things on the menu here are good.   As far as the cheesecake goes, the Cheesecake Factory has THE BEST cheesecake.  Again, you can't go wrong with any of this stuff.  It's all good.  BUT, be warned, one slice has like 750-1000 calories. Wait, but Brandon, what do you recommend? Well check it out homie: 1. Appetizers: Crabcakes, Factory Nachos, Crab & Artichoke Dip, Crispy Crab Bites 2. Salads:  I don't eat salads here 3. Real Food: Kobe Burger (personal favorite, get it with sweet potato fries and ask for chipotle mayo), Southwest Chicken Sandwich, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, Shepherd's Pie, Famous Factory Meatloaf 4. Cheesecake: Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake (a classic), White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut, Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake Oh, and don't get the vietnamese shrimp summer rolls.  Or the fish tacos.  Just sayin",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=140

Vanessa B.,"Houston, TX",73,238,89,5.0,1/16/2015,"I have eaten here a few times, but mostly we get it to go. They give you an estimated time it will be ready, and it's always been ready when I've arrived. The waiting area for dining can be crowded, but the to go counter never has more than one or two people in it, and mostly there's never a line. They pull everything out of the to go bags and go over your order with you to ensure you get what you wanted. They will throw in some of their fresh baked bread and butter at no charge. I recommend the wheat bread, I normally don't prefer wheat bread but theirs is a little sweet, and it's always warm.  The regular portions are huge, and the lunch portions are also huge, but smaller than the normal portion.  The Chinese chicken salad is good, as is the Santa Fe chicken salad. The Santa Fe's dressing is simply amazing, it is described as Spicy Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette, but it is not spicy at all. I always ask for extra dressing. They are stingy on the tortilla strips but you can ask for extras also. The chicken is thinly sliced and everything blends together nicely.  I've also had their lunch pizza & salad, the pizza has a fairly thin crust, and the cheese always tastes great. The lunch shepherd's pie is also very good, and a very nice sized portion.  My only complaint is the traffic around the galleria and the parking. I normally park on the roof deck and pay the minimum charge, even though I'm in and out in less than 15 minutes (this used to be free, but of course now they make you pay!) There is a valet (I think free?), but I've valeted before and told the guy I had to go to one store close by and would be back in less than 20 minutes, but they still went and parked my car & then I had to wait for them to bring it back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=140

After receiving my food, I looked to the table next to us to see them being served spaghetti and meatballs. Also, I ordered a small salad before my meal and it had no dressing on it. My friend ordered a salad as a meal, no croutons. After asking twice, our server brought it out. She also ordered a small side of French fries and after asking three times to the server and food deliverer we had to cancel the order because they did not bring it out. I can understand with it being busy, but this service is uncalled for and unprofessional. Very disappointed in the service and the food.

Melanie H.,"Houston, TX",243,452,600,5.0,9/5/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! And this one is my favorite location.  Growing up, this was the only Cheesecake Factory in Houston (at least that I was aware of) and going here was a big deal. First of all, it's in the Galleria and that's exciting. But then it's kind of fancy and it has SO MANY kinds of Cheesecake! We went for birthdays and special occasions and it used to make me so excited. It still kind of does.  My most recent trip to The Cheesecake Factory was on a date (a third date) and that definitely affected my experience. So, keep that in mind if you keep reading.  It was MAGICAL! Just kidding, but I legitimately do like Cheesecake Factory. The food is good, definitely not healthy, and comes in gargantuan proportions. Think like 3 meals per dish. My date and I both ordered pasta dishes and when they brought them to our table they looked more like serving bowls for an entire table. Sheesh. But I suppose that makes it more worth the money. I ate pasta for lunch for the next 2 days.  Then we shared 2 pieces of cheesecake - a peanut butter chocolate variety and a mango key lime. Both were amazingly delicious. And we had leftovers of that too! I really like the brown bread they serve as well. Slightly sweet and so yummy.  The service is always great at The Cheesecake Factory. And the ambiance is fast-paced in an exciting way. It's probably all in my head, but I just feel like I'm doing something special when I eat at this Cheesecake Factory.  So, yeah, it's unhealthy, it's a chain, it's not local or organic or trendy, and it can now be found in abundance in the suburbs.

Sandy C.,"Houston, TX",23,29,10,1.0,7/20/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory in the Galleria, first the floors were greasy. I had some rubber in the bottom of my shoes, yet it was still slippery and slimy. It just did not feel like the same Cheesecake factory from 3 years ago. Then, I asked for a booth and they took me to a table, I said, as I passed by an empty booth can I sit here? He went back to ask the hostess, and she said sit them at the back booth, they will get their food faster. So, we sat at the booth in the back. Then our waiter was so unsettled, hyper, and looked like he was overstressed. He did not take the time to listen. I think he must have had like 12 tables at a time, not kidding. It took him forever to comeback and brought us water and would leave for 20 minutes or more. Finally, he took our order, but was super hyper. He left, and it took him 15 minutes to come back and tell us, they did not have what we wanted. Cool, we decided to order something different. While we kept waiting, we could see the kitchen and all the action. The lady at the food line in a red shirt and black pants was distributing the orders. She grabbed the plates with her hands, no gloves. And, would swipe a fry and put in her mouth and eat it. That was disgusting!! She did this more than once. The floors were so grease and dirty. No body were gloves in the kitchen. Then, finally our appetizer was out, and our food  5 minutes later almost all at the same time. And while we started to eat. Guess who was our guests at our table. A cockroach!!!!! Not the big size ones like the ones you see everywhere in Texas. No, the kind use see in dirty apartments, nomes, or food establishments.  We dropped our food and could not eat. We called the waiter and told him! Then, he leaned over my daughter, grabbed the roach with a napkin, and some of it dropped in my daughters food. And, we told him we can't eat, this is grease!! We need to speak to the Manager!! So, he said, OH MAN!!! Had a very bad attitude! Very unprofessional! He said, I am bringing your bill out! The nerve of him!! Then, the manager never came, but the bill did. I had to ask a bus boy from the back, since we were literally right next to the kitchen, to please get me the Manager. That took 3 minutes. Because the waiter we had did not want to bring him out. The Manager used all the excuses in the book. Well, this is the way it is everywhere in Houston, plus we can't help it if the other places around us, does not take care of it, sorry about that. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PLACE!!!! GROASE!!!! GROASE!!!! VERY GROASE!!!!    STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!! THESE PEOPLE ARE RUDE!!! HAVE NO MANNERS!!! AND ARE REALLY DIRTY!!!! I will not be surprised if someone has not fallen from those dirty greasy floors, and I know the difference between shiny and greasy!!! I will not be surprised either if someone has had food poisoning there!!!

I had the Avacado egg rolls and they were also served at room temperature. Everything needed salt and lacked flavor. My daughter ordered a Carmel macchiato and even that was served just warm.

I settled with the Lousiana chicken pasta to go but I was so upset because I was looking forward to that dish. My boyfriend refused to eat in front me so his food ended getting cold.

I can't think of any place where I like the bread more, nah not even the cheddar bay biscuits for the seafood lover in you place, that I jokingly refer to as Red Dumpster, since the food either looks like it belongs in the trash or just came out of it, in comparison to the pictures on the menu.  Moving right along, TCF's menu is too damn big, no way in hell you can't find anything appealing. My personal fav is the lemon herb roasted chicken. Juicy with a hint of tart from the lemon, it's divine and comes with carrots and mashed potatoes. Try the corn fritters for an app, delicious. Cobb salad, worth the price tag. NOT a fan of the cajun jambalaya pasta AT ALL, pass it up, save your cheddar, TRUST ME! I have friends in high places and know these things...believe me when I'm trying to hip you to the game!  Hold up partner, don't eat all that food they give you, one must save room for dessert when you come here. Strawberry cheesecake, yum...loves it...BUT my #1, I can't stay away, I dream about this cheesecake y'all, kahlua cocoa coffee. I'd like to imagine God himself created this cheesecake and broke off a slice from heaven just to share with his #1 angel (that would be me FYI)...it's so decadent and rich, made with layers of brownie, kahlua cheesecake, chocolate mousse, and chocolate ganache. Look me in the eyeballs and tell me that ish doesn't sound good! Yeah you can't do it, can ya...don't bother, just run and try it for yourself.

Kate J.,"Beaumont, TX",0,8,,2.0,12/29/2015,"This particular restaurant has been an old favorite of mine whenever I am in town. However, my experience today was the absolute worst to date. We had a party of 8 people- four kids, and four adults. Most of our group was eating here for the very first time; therefore, looking forward to the whole experience. At first things were fine. The waiter seemed attentive and our appetizers were delivered promptly. This is where everything went to sh*t. The kids' meals came out one at a time, and staggered. My daughter's cheese quesadilla was not delivered with the others though, and if you have a group of kiddos, this was upsetting and frustrating for her and me as a parent. Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. No quesadilla yet! No nothing.  I caught a manager's attention and asked what was up with the food, also noticing that our waiter had basically disappeared. While the mngr was standing at the table, the waiter appeared with 2/4 of the adult entrees. The waiter immediately had attitude, and I could see it on his face. He basically threw the plates down and huffed off. Still no quesadilla either. Then we waited some more for the rest of our food. By this point we are all irritated and not enjoying this experience at all. (By the way, if you order the ""Tortilla Soup"" expect to get slop). The last thing that happened involved the huffy waiter when I asked- yet again- where my daughter's quesadilla was. He said, ""don't you get attitude with me, lady! It is not my fault!""  I was so embarrassed and mortified that I lost my appetite completely! When he finally brought it out, it was dripping with grease and looked a mess! All in all, a really depressing experience.

Once our food reached the table, I could tell right away that my chicken on my salad was waaayyyyyyyyy over cooked. (To the point when I could not cut it with a knife.) Instead of sending it back I ate around it because my friend seemed to be enjoying her food, and I didn't want to damper the mood. Several moments had passed when my friend stopped in the middle of our conversation and dropped her fork on her late with a look of disgust. I asked ""what's wrong??"" And she pointed down to her dish where a long strand of hair was sticking out. Now, this was not a piece of hair that just had fallen on top of her dish, it was actually cooked within the chicken! It was embedded in the crust!!!! Soooooo disgusting right? Well after our waiter called a manager, he literally came to us, maybe 10 minutes later.... and stated ""I'm sorry do you want a another one or do you want it off the bill"" he was not empathetic at all! I then asked for another manager and received the same treatment. The second manager offered to take everything off the bill (excluding the drinks) which we accepted.

Cherry A.,"Houston, TX",493,365,2190,3.0,8/24/2013,"I don't always go to chain restaurants, but when I do, it's often at the request of an out-of-towner friend. So, let's do this: lemme get excited about The Cheesecake Factory. First, I do love going to The Galleria for anything. So, next time, I won't be so cheap and deny myself valet service. I decided to park underground and hoof it up a flight of stairs, then another inside the mall ( yup, the escalators were out of service. of course the day I wear high heels. all in the name of sexy heels). Ok, so here's the skinny on the fat-laden Cheesecake factory: Pros: 1. In the mood for something off the menu? Don't hesitate to ask. My BFF was dying for some particular ""brunch-only"" grilled skirt steak and our server pulled some strings to get her exactly what she wanted despite us not being there during brunch. So thank you cool server for hooking us up! 2. The white and dark brown oat bread is warm and delicious with butter. OMG what I won't do for a warm bread basket.  3. Ask for a mango juice spritzer: half of their mango juice with seltzer. You'll thank me later, in case you end up diving in for a bite or three of cheesecake. 4. If you go during lunch, order from their lunch menu. Smaller portions with 2 sides and a smaller price ($11.99). I got the meatloaf with broccoli and sweet potato fries. 2 slices of tasty loaf, with  a little on the mushy side broccoli and perfectly salty sweet SP fries.   Cons: 1. If you sit on the patio upstairs, be sure to bring your sunglasses. You swear you were on the Love Boat 's Lido Desk. It gets super bright. Note: Vampires, sit inside.  2. Bathroom is downstairs only. Ladies, if wearing  heels, be prepared to take the elevator or walk down 1 flight of stairs.  3. Nothing truly exceptional here. The service is hit or miss: you won't get extremely friendly service or any special recommendations.  4. In my opinion, the cheesecakes here look impressive, but I'm more of a fan of smaller portions and lighter tasting cheesecakes. So for that reason, I can only warrant 3 stars.  All in all, if you're dining with someone who loves The Cheesecake Factory or a group with diverse tastes, their menu is perfect. And if you decide to go face first into dessert, you can always walk it off in the mall, but ladies, be sure to bring your walking shoes ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=180

We're staying at the Westin Galleria and around 10pm we really wanted something sweet to eat. The hotels room service is not good choices with even worse prices. The mall closes at 9 so we're excited that there was a Cheesecake Factory still open! My point is not to talk about quality. We're going there for cheesecake, obviously the quality is amazing! But the lady who worked the ""to go"" section was so nice. I wish we had gotten her name. We were chit chatting and it came up that it was my birthday tomorrow so when she gave me my order she told me there was a surprise inside that I wouldn't see until I got home.

Aaron M.,"Houston, TX",361,305,30,3.0,3/10/2014,"I have never been here when it has NOT been insanely busy.  I'm not sure what it is about this place that makes people lose their mind. It's in the Galleria - so parking is always a hassle.   There is almost always a wait, even on either end of peak times.  You could probably go at 2pm on a weekday and be ok.  But a Friday or Saturday night?  There's gonna be a wait. The hostesses have always been friendly.  However, I do have a SERIOUS problem with their tabling system.  As I noted earlier, this place is always packed.  When you check in, you're given a pager and told your wait time.  Unfortunately most other guests just pile up right there by the hostess stand.  When your table is ready, they buzz you, take your pager and point about 10 feet away and tell you to stand there and wait.  Again.  The place they pointed?  Right where everyone is hanging out OR trying to walk through.  It's a high traffic area for guests coming up the stairs below, waiters carrying food to tables, the check out place for people having just cheesecake, the folks just standing there because they have nowhere else to go AND the people just directed there by the hostess.   I just don't understand why it's done that way.  Buzz me via the pager, and hand me off immediately to a waiter or someone to seat me.  Please don't make me go dance around the dozens of other folks in that tiny little area. With that said, our waiter was fantastic.  Brandon seemed to be having a good time, and he was worth a large tip.   The food was also pretty damn good.  You're not going to get super fancy food that you'll never see again, but you will get a pretty excellent meal.  Between the drinks (Long Island is a beast), the appetizers (Buffalo Blasts, seriously) and the food (Chicken Romano!) - I was stuffed, fat and happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=200

And then he looked at me, obviously thought that I didn't see even though I was watching him, and put it back in the bag. Half of the topping of my original cheesecake was on the top.

Paulette M.,"Humble, TX",20,10,2,1.0,12/11/2015,"Today I brought my group of seniors to eat here.  This was our main reason for visiting the Galleria. I had heard the food was the best, the price was the best and the service was better than best.  Here are the facts: We arrived at The Cheesecake Factory and were seated at 11:05 AM.  We met our sweet and very cordial waitress.  She got us our drinks, mostly water. Then we gave our orders for our meals.  We were a group of nine elderly persons.  We told the waitress how we looked forward to this treat of eating at this nice restaurant.  She brought us bread and butter and more bread and butter and this was delicious .  When we first arrived at the restaurant and at our table, we were the only customers in this area.  By the time we got our bread, more people were sitting around us.  Around Noon most of the people around us were already eating their meals.  We were still being served bread.  Though the bread was delicious,we really wondered where our meals were.  We spoke to the manager and told him we needed to be on a bus at 1:00 PM and asked where were our meals.  He said they will be here soon.    At 12:30 (Now remember we did have to be on the bus by 1:00 PM)we were still waiting for our food.  We saw our waitress running quickly with food for every other table.  We finally told the manager and our waitress to be sure to bring some take home containers and bags because it seemed like we weren't going to have time to eat there.  They said all would  be okay.  and finally at 12:35 some meals started arriving at our tables.  Some were quickly removed because they were someone else's order.  We did get our meals and had about 10 minutes to eat what we had ordered.  Most of us put the meal in our carry out bag. We had been in that restaurant sitting down for an hour and a half before we were served a meal.  My meal was eaten as a take home for supper, a very expensive ""TV microwave meal."" And I didn't even have time to buy a slice of cheese cake. This was the first time any of us had eaten here before and I am sure it will be the last time because I do believe that the manager should have given us these meals on the house... I hate to say it but I believe if we had been a group of young business men we would have gotten our meals comp or we would have walked out.  Going to the Cheesefactory today was a trip planned to be so much fun for many seniors who looked forward to this for over a month and what a let down it was, thanks the manager who didn't even acknowledge his responsibility to his customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=200

I dropped a star for one reason, this location gets quiet busy given that its connected to a shopping mall. Waiting time could go up to an hour even for a party of 2.

My mother had showed up 10 minutes early and got us a table. From the minute my mother sat down and the rest of us showed up it had been a total of 25 minutes if not a bit more WITHOUT anyone acknowledging our table! I decided to get up  and find the manager. I flagged him down and let him know how long it had been. He followed me over to the table and David (the manager) offered to take our drink order. My mother said it would be best to order everything now since we didn't want to wait any longer. David quickly said that he would JUST put in our drink orders and that the server should be over to take our food order. Wow really David?     Okay so after waiting five more increasingly annoying minutes, the server comes over to the table with like six bread baskets stacked up on top of each other and resting on his dirty work shirt. He picks out two baskets and drops them on the table. He happily apologizes for the wait and goes on to say, ""Sorry y'all there are other tables before y'all so I'm taking care of them first so y'all just have to wait."" AWESOME!! So of course he left again. David comes over and drops off our drinks and leaves. He didn't ask how anything was going or if we have been helped yet. Nothing. He just quickly left completely avoiding the situation. So the server comes back and FINALLY takes our order after being gone 5 more minutes since his last friendly visit. He takes the order and leaves. I am extremely enraged at this point in time. Food comes out in a ""timely"" manner. My cousin had ordered his burger well done and it came out damn near rare. Awesome.    I just want it to be known that I don't like the server we had. He is completely unprofessional and he kept talking to us like we were his buddies. His mannerisms are absolutely terrible, he kept playing with his nose while talking to us and he was arrogant. Any who the server comes over to check on us and he crouched down near my mother and asks her how's her food then proceeds to ask her if she's ""getting her money's worth""..... WOW!!! Who hired this clown?? Unbelievable. And yet again I see David pass up our table without a word. So weak. I ask for some boxes and the check. He comes back with the boxes and later he drops the check and of course we expect nothing would be comp'd off especially with the overwhelming warm experience we have had. Which nothing was. It's not about the money. We come here to spend money. It's about showing you care and you're sorry for the horrendous experience we've had and you hope we come back.

If I  had high blood pressure,  I'd be dead.  Ok so we waited over 30 minutes for crab cakes I had my mouth set for only to be brought what appeared to be 3 overcooked hockey pucks...needless to say I sent them back.

I found it funny that she placed the children's menu (not the coloring book one but the laminated one that has the kids menu) in front of the two youngest and said that these are for the kids. As if my one and two year old can read the menu. It took 10 minutes for our server to greet us.  She messed up my husband's order. I clearly heard his order and I understood it but she didn't. He ordered the grilled salmon and it came with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  He said he wanted asparagus instead of mashed potatoes and they bring him the salmon, asparagus and the mashed potatoes.  Anywho there are too many complaints I can write in details and I have better things to do with my time. The service sucks, the staff are snotty, they need to be trained with customer service.

When I went, we had to wait for about 15 minutes and there wasn't a good waiting area. It sure was fancy inside though! As for the meal itself... I always eat too much of the yummy wheat bread appetizer and I think we asked for about 2 or 3 refills (the waitress might have been annoyed). My friend ordered some kind of Mexican salad with chicken and cheese and peanut dressing which was huge; she said it was really good and didn't even finish the entire portion. I ordered a salad with salmon which was pretty average. The salmon was slightly dry. Definitely not worth the $15 I paid. We didn't end up getting cheesecake but I've had it before and it's really good - super rich and creamy! One slice is wayyyyy more than enough for one person. I'd say 2-3 people can share so at $7 a slice, it's a good deal! All the flavors I've tried I've liked but my favorite flavor is the red velvet.

The portions are huge.  If you have anything else to do while you are at the Galleria and know you won't be bringing any leftovers home, then most of the pasta, salad, and dinner entrees will be a waste of money for you.  If you want to leave the table without feeling bloated, then try a sandwich or burger with a small side-salad instead of the fries.  I did this for the first time on this visit and it is the first time I've left the restaurant and felt like I could continue to walk around comfortably.   The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that if I want a slice of cheesecake I can walk in, get my slice of cake to-go, and then walk out.  That's about it.  Otherwise, it's just a typical mediocre chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=260

My friend asked for lemon for her water and more bread, and we received neither. My fries weren't delivered until much later, and the server dashed off so fast, I couldn't even ask for ketchup. Seriously, who eats fries without condiments? Drinks were never refilled, I ended up giving my friend half of my glass of water.

To go along with the over the top interior design, the menus are filled with a crazy variety of foods.  The Food: First, there is a lot of variety (from pizza, to tacos, to steaks, to pastas, to everything else). Second, the food is probably more costly than it should be. Paying almost 20 dollars for chicken/cheese pasta is a little on the expensive side. The price may be proportional to the portion size, which is very large. I think it would be better if they made the portion smaller, and lowered the price to match the size. Beyond the pasta, I've had their pizza, burgers, steaks, pork chops, and chicken. Whoa, I've been to The Cheesecake Factory too many times. The food has not been terrible, it just has not been memorable. And the Cheesecake: The Cheesecake Factory wins the prize for having the worst tasting cheesecake flavor/combination I've ever had.... Key Lime Pie Cheesecake. It was bad, but maybe it was my fault for ordering something like Key Lime Pie Cheesecake. Go ahead, say ""Key Lime Pie Cheesecake"" out loud. Sounds terrible doesn't it? Ignoring the above, the other cheesecakes I've tried were not bad. Strawberry, Oreo, Snickers, Raspberry, Cherry, etc. They are 7-8 dollars, large, and easily shareable between two people. The Cheesecake Factory must be doing something right though. They are always packed. I can't say that I've ever had bad service. Sometimes slow service, but I can see why given the volume of people in the restaurant(s) when I've been there. I've been many times, though I must say that it's never been my idea to go! The Cheesecake Factory tries to do too much and fails at having anything memorable. It is definitely average... but average should not cost this much. Somewhere between 2-3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=260
Mario V.,"Washington Corridor, Houston, TX",68,34,5,1.0,2/2/2014,I have been to this location 3 times in the past 6 months. Every time I have received bad service. I'm not sure if the service is due to bad mgt or the wait staff. I understand this is a tourist location but come on.  1st bad experience host told us 15 min. That ended up to 1hr and half. Then the waiter forgot my sisters food 2nd bad experience there was no wait but might as well been. Took us about the same to get our food.  3rd bad exp. utensils were dirty(2 sets). They where out of cokes. Rude wait staff. I could go on but my food finally got here.   I do not know why I keep coming back here maybe because I get gift cards from family.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=260

Kathryn H.,"Houston, TX",80,82,9,2.0,5/13/2014,"I know a lot of people cultishly love this place.  Co-workers rave about it and light up when they get to go for their birthday.  These are the same co-workers that prefer Miller Lite over a special crafted pilsner.   I went years ago, and just never went back.  We had a party of five, and it was during the busiest time possible (much to my chagrin).  I don't know why my friends at the time insisted on going when you couldn't fit your pinky toe into the building because of the crowds.   Needless today, that pretty much put my experience way down low - and it's really not their fault for the bad timing of my friends.    I might have thought better of it if I went when it wasn't swarming with people.  Personally, I prefer the smooth and creamy type of cheesecake - I'm not a fan of the curdled cheesecakes that have this weird, pilly texture.  I recognize that it's a personal preference over actual quality.  Everyone else loved theirs - I just don't like my cheesecake to have that consistency.   The food was so overly salted, the vegetables were mushy and overcooked, and the chicken I had was definitely pre-prepared.   The portion was almost four meals for myself - and I ended up throwing most of it away.   I have heard that they've introduced a diet, small plate, or skinny menu, but I just wasn't impressed enough to go back on my own. If my friends invite me, I might give them another go - I just didn't see what all the hype was about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=260

Wahoo for National Cheesecake day!  I was a bit eager, and jumped on their promo for half off a slice of cheesecake a day before the actual day.  Arrived, put name down and was surprisingly seated with no less than a 10 minute wait.  I could be wrong as I was distracted by the case of cheesecakes, trying to decide which one to get really made time fly.  Seated, promptly brought out a basket of bread and butter and I obligingly ate even though I was only here for dessert.  We had brown bread and white bread, I didn't care for the white one as I think it was Sourdough but I liked the slight sweetness of the brown one (Rye with flakes of Oatmeal?).  Anyways the brown bread was good and went well with the butter.  I think it is just your generic butter but the combination was addictive to me, I love bread and butter, especially since this one was warm!  However, I devoured this one while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and when the second basket came, it was cold =(, I don't like cold bread. I wasn't super upset as our cheesecake and guests arrived shortly after and food always makes me happy.  We really wanted the tiramisu cake, but promo didn't work for cakes so bf and I split the tiramisu cheesecake.  The cheesecake version is denser and I think I prefer the traditional fluffy, light, creamy mousse, but the flavor profile overall was good.  I liked how I could taste the mocha flavor and it wasn't overly sweet and the whip cream was good.  Sadly our dining experience ended on a sour note as the service we received from our waitress was subpar.  I understood she was busy but she didn't seem so pleasant.  When I asked for another set of silverware and more bread for our guests she sounded reluctant to get it.  We also ended up waiting over 10 minutes to pay and had to have another waiter handle our bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=260

Today was different, thank goodness. I also asked the waiter about my choices and they were honest with me. Told me motto get grilled fish because it's too dry. So I decided to go with the Jamaican pepper spiced dish. I like spicy and it had a kick but wasn't anywhere near overwhelming. Full of flavor (chicken and shrimp), plantains were cooked exactly like I like them(medium, a little firm but breaks when you cut through) the black beans were seasoned well so I just mixed my rice with it and wonderfulness happened(lol) even the mango mixture was power packed! This experience was worth five stars.

She said it was on the way and left. 5 minutes later she just returned with my side dish. I asked that it be to go because I had to go back to work. After waiting another 5 minutes and nothing we asked for the manager. The manager came over and said she would get my food and out bill was taken care of. Once the to go bag came we left only to be chased out in the mall, 10 stores down, where the waiter openly accused us of dining and dashing. We told the server the manager told us we were covered. She said we needed to come back and pay. We walked all the way back, escorted by her like criminals in the mall, only for the manager to tell us no we are good to go. So frustrating!!

Taylor B.,"Houston, TX",74,78,66,4.0,10/28/2011,"This place seems to get a bad rap as being overpriced. I don't know where that idea is coming from as they give you a lot of food and it's always good quality.  The location by the Galleria isn't the nicest location I've been to, but the fact that it's inside of a mall makes it perfect for a weekend dinner or lunch. Last week after a lovely visit to the Houston Zoo I deiced to eat here with my friend Tien for dinner. Our waitress was very friendly and got our drink order filled right away. It wasn't until a few years ago they started putting a sweet tea option on the menu. Their passion fruit tea is terrible and taste like soap. Tien ordered the strawberry lemonade which is sweet and delcious.(Stole some while she wasn't looking) I've been here several times so I can honestly say everything, even the bread is fantastic. The Santa Fe Salad is the only thing green I will eat. The Salmon is always baked to perfection and can be cut with your fork. Event the burger and fries are good here. The biggest downside to the great tasting food is that it's very hard to leave room for cheesecake. It's always such a let down walking bast those monster sized cakes and knowing that if you eat another bite you wont be able to make it home. There is also an issue with wait times it can get pretty hectic here, and sometimes you can end up waiting a very long time to eat. Other than that Cheese Cake Factory is great, and I'm sure many of you have already eaten here, so enjoy your next visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=280
Sarah G.,"Towson, MD",47,288,,4.0,3/6/2013,"Mahi tacos (shared with a friend), flourless chocolate cake, Limoncello creme torte and an espresso! That's all I need to be happy. They do a great job here--the location is huge (2 stories, is that common? Haven't been to any other locations) and the set up is so elaborate I have no idea how the waiters and hosts know their way around the food delivery, table finding, and ticket administration procedures. You need a sherpa to go to the bathroom. I can't tell you much about decor, because it is kind of crazy and dark and shiny inside and always busy walking through to your table, but once you are sat, you can chat with your companions pretty easily and hear each other. All I remember for my party of 5 was a big soft leather crescent shaped booth and lots of mirrors behind everyone's heads. I disagree with the ""overpriced Chilis"" comparison. Yes it has basics like hamburgers for the picky people, but their menu is pretty diverse, too, and they do a good job having something available for everyone without being overly generic. If you want a burger, who cares! Get one for god's sake! It's your life, go for it! But you can also get beets with goat cheese, Vietnamese tacos, Ahi tartare, Lemon Ricotta pancakes (die! esp with bacon), a Navajo sandwich (with fry bread!), sweet corn tamale cakes...you could eat here every day and not try everything that piques your interest. My favorite part is that it is priced reasonably, but tries new things all the times. It's accessible! I think if you are coming here for a ""dining experience"" [snob voice] and are a person who sniffs the wine cork, you will be disappointed. But coming in for a shot of port and dessert, why not!  Yes, it's a chain, but a damn good one! I am happy to drop a $20 here. More like $30 for myself by the time I am done eating, but it is one of those places that has both awesome desserts (and not just cheesecake) and the food is great too! Huge plates, though, so probably share. OR just get dessert and commit to a whole slice. I have never had anything I wouldn't order again! This is where I eat when I am at the Galleria, for sure, but even if I am not at the Galleria, I would make a special trip to the Westheimer location just to get a good desert fix. It's hard to find a dessert place anymore, and I don't care what anyone in Houston says--a cupcake is not a desert! It's a snack!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-houston?start=280

Andrew E.,"Houston, TX",99,353,50,3.0,6/27/2013,"What's not to like about the Cheesecake Factory? Well okay, maybe their prices, but 7 bucks for a slice of cheese cake is pretty middle of the road when it comes to buying dessert at a chain restaurant. This has its pros and cons - the prices are average, but so is the dessert.  While they are a step above what you might get at Restaurant X, Y, Z, they really are just a cookbook dessert.  This makes me sadder when I know I can buy a whole cheesecake, not just a slice, at Costco for 14 bucks.  Ok that was an unfair comparison. The Costco's cheesecake selection is nowhere near as expansive as the Cheesecake Factory's but the quality is on par in my opinion. I guess in short, the cheesecake tastes good, but it is no way mindblowing. This is just a good place to grab a bite to eat with friends and enjoy some decent desert. But like any chain restaurant, it lacks the 'must have' ring to it. Service is meh - I saw one of the guys drop a to-go order, look around and pick it up. Sadly that was my fiancee's to-go order. Maybe that's why I'm unimpressed. For how much you pay, you should at least get quality. Throwing away that slice and giving customers quality is far more important than saving the $1 that slice is really worth and pissing them off later.

This is probably the safest place to take anyone since the menu is so large, it is in the Galleria so it is happy/shiny, and it is good food. The food review is going to be severed into two parts: not-cheesecake and cheesecake. Not-cheesecake: The salads are fine. The burgers are fine. The fish tacos are the best thing in my opinion, that is usually what I am ordering. The food is better than so-so or middling honestly. You won't not eat the food. But I have never had an OMGincredible meal here. Sorry, I still love the place but you really don't come here for the best burger in the world. Cheesecake: This is why I come here. The cheesecake is incredible. The list of options is bigger than my head. I try a new one every time I go to a Cheesecake Factory in any city I am in, and I still have maybe had half of the options. My only nit-picky things with this location are that the drinks are expensive and it gets quite noisy depending on where you sit. If you get the right seat it is perfect. Get the wrong seat and you might grind your teeth a bit.
