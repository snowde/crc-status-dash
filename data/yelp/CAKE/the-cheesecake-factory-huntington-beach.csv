Lea S.,"Tulare, CA",0,10,,2.0,4/7/2017,"I typically love The Cheesecake Factory, and I always get the same thing, the hibachi steak. Tonight I ordered it from door dash so I could enjoy it at home. I didn't mind that after fees and a 20% tip for the driver I paid about 12 dollars extra for the convenience but I regret doing so. I anticipated that it wouldn't be AS good as at the restaurant but it was a pretty bad experience. I received the food without any napkins or silverware, which was unexpected but obviously I could fix that problem. The steak was cooked properly and had good flavor but there wasn't any tempura asparagus, which was really disappointing. There was a very small amount of sprouts and the other vegetables to top it all off, next time I want to eat at home I will be sure to go somewhere else. I'll stick to only dining in when I'm craving the Cheesecake Factory. A bit of a bummer I spent a decent amount of money on such a disappointing meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=380

The stars are for the wraps, she never came back to check on me until I begged for a box I think the manager  buried the help, frankly, and to be fair . Gnarly.

Cindy L.,"Walnut, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/30/2017,"Worst service ever.  Time can Not be replaced.  I value my Sundays as it is The only few hours I have to Myself.  Waste of my valuable time.  Was told my first meal would not be charged.  His name is Jacob, or Jason. Justin is what the next table remembers.  At least, honor your word.  Being cheap and greedy just lost the company a long, and loyal customer.  I had ordered 2 as I expressed to the waiter of my extreme hunger.  Does a salad look fulfilling?!  I sit another 20-30 minutes.  To my disappointment, first waiter did not put my correct order in.  Had asked for my salad to be Without dressing, which had plenty of.  She took it away, after my disapproval.  I sit for another length of time for the order I originally ordered first.  Get my bill, and am charged for both!  Ridiculous.  I normally order 2-3 items as I can Eat, along with dessert.  My average bill runs upward towards 100 each time, me alone.  I will definitely Not return.  Waste of my time.  Instead of having to pay for my bill, my precious time should have been compensated.  Service horrendous.  Negative 5 stars if I could, from both waiters, to the manager.  I actually came last week for tiramisu.  I decided then, the Italian restaurant down my block had a better, tastier version.  Thank god.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=380
Jonathan N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1189,365,367,3.0,8/3/2013,"Usually I'd expect The Cheesecake Factory to be super packed. Well my visit went along with my expectations but surprisingly, my party of 12 were seated within half an hour which was pleasant. We got our drink orders maybe 10 minutes after sitting. The bad part was that it took them 20 minutes to send over somebody to take our orders. Just because we're a big party and we're instantly charged gratuity no matter what doesn't mean they can take their sweet time to deliver subpar service.  I'd imagine a reasonable wait because any real restaurant would attempt to send over the entire table top at the same time. The only problem with that is that a member of my party actually ended up getting served the wrong food and the waitress was insistent that that was what she ordered. I didn't know vegetarians ordered some kind of chicken sandwich. My friend must have been mistaken because she looked like she definitely ordered that and was obviously confused. However, I was lucky enough to get the dish that I ordered. I had the sheppard's pie and although I had an image in my head of what it would look like (and it came out looking different from most traditional servings of it), the taste was fairly on point. Nice mashed potatoes, good amount of vegetables that weren't cooked to kingdom come, the beef wasn't anything special, but overall, comfort food done alright. Just an average experience. Nothing too special. Nothing too terrible besides the neglect of service. I honestly would dine at a different location just because I've had better experiences with service at their other branches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=380

Pamela Z.,"Westminster, CA",62,28,7,2.0,12/28/2015,"Really disappointed! We ate at the Cheesecake Factory yesterday and ordered sliders for the kids and fries, Jambalaya, salmon and spinach. Only thing that came to our table hot was my salmon. The sliders came with no cheese, so when I requested cheese be added they were brought back with a piece of hard cheese thrown inside and still cold, my husbands Jambalaya was just warm. My salmon was hot, but the spinach was anything but edible. Last but least we ordered the Chocolate mouse cheese cake and as the last visit, it tasted old. I should have said something but l did not. This was not the first time I have been disappointed at the Bella Terra location. Shame on me we will not be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=380
Katie S.,"Redlands, CA",180,143,211,3.0,2/27/2013,"This is harder for me to rate.  I truly enjoyed this location.   For a corporate restaurant the service was amazing.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  There were 2 different managers who did table touches throughout our meal.  Also, something that stuck out for me was we ordered deep fried mac n cheese as an appetizer.  We'd only been waiting 8 minutes or so and the manager came by our table and mentioned that our appetizer didn't look as good as he wanted it to so he asked to have a new batch prepared.  He apologized for our non existent wait and asked if he could get us anything in the mean time.  What?  Seriously?  I was pleasantly surprised.  I've worked in restaurants for the majority of my life and managers aren't always as involved as you'd like them to be.  When our appetizer did arrive it was piping hot and looked delicious.   My boyfriend's family could talk about this dish for days.  They are all big fans.  It's pretty darn successful.  Although I don't know how you can go wrong with creamy mac n cheese, a crispy breading and a pink marinara dipping sauce.  It's very rich so I barely got through one but still they are worth ordering again. As if I hadn't had enough pasta I decided on more pasta for my entree.  However this dish was loaded with asparagus, peas, bell peppers and tomatoes all tossed with really tender chicken and a chipotle cream sauce.  I don't know how it works, but it works.  I ordered a lunch portion and I still couldn't get half way through it so they are really generous.   My boyfriend had the Steak Diane which was pretty good as well  The sauce alone was really nice.  The steak was cooked so nicely, which I like to point out because corporate places get that wrong more often than not.   Everything was good, above average for sure BUT  there are still many places I would rather head back to before this.  They are A Ok in my book in a good way.  I'd go 3.5 for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=380

Cathy M.,"Anaheim, CA",280,1133,1081,4.0,12/25/2013,"Mhmn delicious! The food is definitely pricey, but they give out large portions. I definitely recommend the Fettuccine Alfredo. It's so creamy and delicious. I also tried out their nachos + spinach dip as their appetizer. The dip wasn't as cheesy as I had hoped for it to be. I wish it had a bit more flavor to it. Regardless, it was a giant appetizer for the price we paid. My favorite part was probably the dessert. Red Velvet Cheesecake is just mouthwatering. The cheesecake was rich and moist. The cream cheese just melts in your mouth and there's white chocolate shavings decorated on the end of the cake. I'd kill for another slice. Screw the calories and eat the cheesecake.

Caitlin A.,"Alhambra, CA",1474,814,2214,4.0,11/20/2011,"I haven't ate at The Cheesecake Factory in years.. It was back when I was still working in Newport Beach, so we would always go to the one in Fashion Island. I had a $25 giftcard so I figured, why not? The hubby and I loaded the kids and off we went. The HB location is closer to home. We didn't have to wait at all, 2pm on a Friday afternoon. Yeah, late lunch. The host mispelled my name, kept calling me Carolyn even though I kept correcting him Caitlin. Whatevs.  Our waiter was exceptional. I think his name was Dylan. He was super friendly and checked on us just enough, not too little and not a lot. Refilled our drinks without us even having to ask. Definitely on his A game.  We ordered the chicken tenders w fries (kinda dry) and mac n cheese (really gourmet, yum!) for the kids. We started with the ahi tuna tartare and endive salad. I enjoyed both a lot. For our entrees, the hubby had the SkinnyLicious turkey & avocado sandwich w a clam chowder and I had the SkinnyLicious chicken salad sandwich w a caesar (shoulda substituted w a soup instead). Both our sandwiches were meh but the soup was really flavorful. My caesar was a little overkill since we shared the endive salad already.  Overall, I'm really impressed with their new menu selections. I mean, it has been a few years since I ate here, but it's definitely improved. I'll definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=380
Michelle C.,"Garden Grove, CA",38,6,1,1.0,8/2/2015,"Something has changed at this location and it's definitely not good!!! I have been going here since they opened and the food was good for a while. We just went to eat here a couple nights ago and it was the worst food I have ever had here! I keep thinking maybe it's because we came early at 5 before the dinner rush but that's no excuse. The waiter was not friendly at all. The food was barely warm and did not taste good. And the cheesecake was not even good. I feel like they must have new cooks and staff. They are way overpriced and don't seem to care about the quality of the food or the waitstaff being friendly and accommodating. I got the chicken and biscuits and the biscuits were really small and burnt, the mashed potatoes were not creamy and not hot at all. The chicken was thin and salty. I had this dish a long time ago and the biscuits were huge fluffy and homemade. They looked like frozen biscuits and come on if you burn them cook more don't serve your customers burnt food when it's expensive. My husband got jambalaya and it was also barely warm. Seemed to me the dishes were left overs from lunch cooking. They didn't even try to heat up the food.  Very disappointed we will not be coming back to this location.

Both of us, an hour later, start feeling bad, bloated and just overall disgusting. Next thing you know we start throwing up that pasta we both had. Extremely disappointed especially that being our first (AND LAST) time dining there. BE CAREFUL THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY UNSANITARY. Today at work all day I felt disgusting, weak and lost my appetite.

Cheesecake factory has always been a staple of when I don't know where to eat.   With their book of choices to eat.  Portion sizes are HUGE and recommended to share. Their avocado rolls are my favorite.  The stuffed mushrooms and fried chicken sliders are always good.  Mostly everything on the menu is tasty and filling.  Can't go wrong with ur selection!  Staff is friendly.  Atmosphere is modern and spacey.  Reminds me of a buffet place in Las Vegas.   Parking is kind of hectic.  There is a parking structure but its a little ways to get to the resto.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=420

Emily F.,"Redding, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/30/2016,"My boyfriend and I are Cheesecake Factory regulars - often coming more than once a week, and always spending plenty of money each time as we always order drinks, appetizers, meals and dessert.

She never offered us bread so we had to specifically request it when she came to take our order. She never visited our table, and when she did she always had other table's dirty dishes and hardly said a word to us. (Mind you this whole time we have been nothing but patient and kind to her, just slightly baffled at how inattentive she has been compared to how the service at Cheesecake Factory usually is). My boyfriend and I both waited over 15 minutes for a drink refill. When we got our food, she did not check up on us at all. We managed to flag her down for the bill, and when she asked us if we would like it to be boxed, we said yes. Then she proceeded to ask us to HAND HER THE PLATES even though she was standing right in front of our table. Because of the lack of service, we hadn't eaten much between the time our food was brought out and when we wanted to leave, so I had to pick up my multiple and heavy plates, still full of food, to hand her across the table - absolutely unprofessional.

The manager was so apologetic, and went to the kitchen to see what the problem was. The waited was very apologetic also. The manager felt so bad, he comped our dinner and also treated us to a piece of cheesecake. Both the waiter and the manager came to our table to apologize again and again, and to tell us how badly they felt, and that they take these matters seriously.  I probably should be giving the restaurant a lower rating because of the food situation, but we left feeling that we were treated more than fairly, and that they were truly sorry for what happened.

So we decided to come for dinner. We ordered the egg roll sampler, my girlfriend ordered the lemon herb chicken and I ordered the Italian sandwich. The egg rolls pretty good although my favorite out of the platter would be the southwestern egg rolls (a must try). Our entrées came next. The sandwich was big and delicious I ordered it with a salad. But the salad seemed as if I was dressed early and sitting in a bowl. It was soggy and wilted when it came out to our table. The chicken was juicy and moist. But overly salty. We immediately told our server and sent her manager to our table with the complaint for her dish.

One, their bread is amazing and usually comes out nice and warm. Their brown bread is soo good, I crave it all the time. I don't know what they put in it, but I can never stop eating it. Two, their Louisiana pasta is amazing...I love the cajun sauce with the bowtie pasta. It comes with crispy chicken, and is to die for.  Three, Their cheesecake is good, decadent and rich. I like their white chocolate chip macadamia nut and pumpkin.  Four, the ambience is intimate  and dimly lit. Their wait is usually not that long.

Amaya S.,"Redlands, CA",787,486,855,3.0,5/21/2012,"3 1/2 Stars! Let me explain why I didn't give this Location a 4 star review.... because I really did enjoy myself.  Its mainly because of the location and the lack of view.  Sorry to be so picky.  But its in a crowded shopping center, nothing to special about that.... Parking is a madhouse here so be ready. Either park in the garage that is 2 city blocks away (not really, but it helps my story), or patrol the lot with force.   As with any Cheesecake Factory is decorated nice and everyone is nice.  I've been to quite a few CFs and have never had a bad experience.  My waitress was very hospitable and kind which makes their push to sell cheesecake at the end palpable.  Funny I'm always to full for the cheesecake. I started off with a Blueberry Mojito.  YUM. I'm a girl who loves a good mojito, hell I love a bad mojito too as long as it has liquor.  This one was sweet and tart with a minty after taste. And I was slightly buzzed.  I ordered the Bleu Cheese BLT with Fries.  Delicious.  While I hate Bleu Cheese Dressing I LOVE the crumbles, weird.  The burger was cooked perfectly to a medium rare and the bacon was crispy.  The fries were seasoned well, especially with my side of ranch.  Whatever you do DON'T order the Mac and Cheese Burger..... mid-way through I got so depressed that I was eating a Burger topped with Fried Mac and Cheese, seriously.

I would have liked a bit more rice and beans in the chili, but there was LOADS of chicken and it's very savory.  The Tuscan Chicken is served with balsamic vinegarette and has asparagus and grape tomatoes.aplenty. Both dishes were excellent. There was a funny lack of communication about the cheesecake.  My wife sez she wants Key Lime and waiter asks if she wants to split it.  She says, ""No, I want the whole thing"".  Apparently he thinks she means a whole cheesecake b/c he says, ""You can't cut it for about an hour and a half.  It's deep-frozen.""  It took a minute or two to get that straightened out, and I had some kind of totally obscene chocolate cake, of which I could only eat half, so I had the other half for breakfast.

And soo as I walk in they were able To seat us within 2-4 min, not bad ... The menu was a little overwhelming so I asked are waitress to come back in a few.. I didn't mean 15 min later... So we then ordered .. 2 couples sat down on each side of us , ordered and  ate there food before we even got ours .. So 3 baskets of bread later the waitress came to us realizing it's been over a 1/2 hour and apologized and brought us complimentary bowl of soup and more bread !! Yeahh ( being a smart ass ) and then said  she will be back with drink since our glasses have been empty for at least 10min . But still kept bring us bread . Then are food finally arrived .. Ohh my soo disappointed it taste sooo bad .. I got Evelyn's fav .. Well it was pasta noodles that tasted straight from  the boiling water NO FLAVOR AT ALL .. The eggplant was like rubber, mayb because it was cooked for over 40 min idk .. And the whole 2 small pieces of artichoke .. I was soo bummed .. But the time I filled up on bread and soup with nothing to drink and a crappy  flavorless plate and the over hour being there I just wanted to leave - and I missed the best part getting a slice of cheesecake to go ..

Christina O.,"Garden Grove, CA",134,22,10,1.0,8/20/2014,"Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite places to eat but now it's not so great. I notice this about a lot of food chain restaurants that are at first successful and then they become almost sluggish and careless. The food quality is not as great, and the service was almost nonexistent. But hey, people will still come to Cheesecake Factory no matter what, food is decent for price you pay for and it's a nice place to dine in without going anywhere too expensive. Now I never have a problem when I eat here, in fact the customer service is usually great the past couple times I've been here. I was here on Tuesday around 2-3pm (don't exactly remember the time). Me and my boyfriend decided to eat outside since it was pretty cold inside with the ac. Our server's name was Lori-Ellen. When she came to take our order she didn't even smile or greet us, she just asked us if we were ready to order. We got the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and fried calamari. What bothered me the most was when she came to bring us the food. She literally dropped off the plate on the corner of the table and left. Um hello?? It'd be nice if you left it in the center of the table for us to eat? Seriously..when she did that with the calamari and came back with the jambalaya, she did the same thing twice. Oh and the extra plates she brought us, the top one was dirty, I don't know why she thought we wouldn't notice that large stain on the dishes she handled us, but I guess she's TOO busy to check if they're clean before she gives them out. We actually told a different server who was working outside as well for a clean plate and she was a lot more friendlier. It was not even busy outside at all, it was just two other tables and us. She checked up on us once. Couldn't find her anywhere, we had to ask a busser for a different sauce for the calamari, he was really nice and helpful, brought it out quick. I wish I knew his name, I'm pretty sure he'd be a way better server than the one we had.  It took forever for her to come outside, we were waiting to ask for the check, ended up waiting for like 15-20mins. I don't know where she disappeared off to. She just seemed lazy about her job and didn't really care much about providing great customer service, please act like you like working there a bit more or don't even work there at all. She also seemed careless about taking the dirty plates off, I don't want to exaggerate and say she slammed the plates together, but it did seem kind of rude to make so much noise clearing plates off our table.I've been a server too so I know what looks acceptable and what doesn't as a server.  Things like this don't usually bother me that much, but I've never have a bad experience like this the other times I've dined, I probably won't be back for a while. We probably just had a bad server but meh, I'll think twice about eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=500

Chris D.,"Garden Grove, CA",509,896,5314,3.0,1/15/2011,"Thanks to my work's white elephant gift exchange we did I ended up with a $25 cheesecake factory gift card. I've never been a fan of CF since in most of my experiences the food is pretty mediocre but hey, I'm willing to give it another chance. I haven't been in years since they baked wax paper in my pizza crust.  This location is beautiful inside. Marble everywhere and spotless. Our waitress Veronica was excellent. She was informative, had a great sense of humor, and was extremely friendly.  Bread basket here comes with squaw and french bread.  Both tasted very fresh.  My wife and I loved the squaw bread and were fighting over slices.   After perusing the giant menu of both food and advertisements I was strongly drawn to the crispy beef stir fry..... sounded delicious and I've had it before. When it was my turn to order for some reason I didn't order what I was craving.... out of my mouth came ""green chile cheeseburger"". Why I ordered this I have no clue but it was pretty disappointing. The burger should of been very tasty but it was so bland and boring. The ground beef had no flavor, the cheese had zero flavor, as did the thimble size portion of pico de gallo (had to ask for more). I was hoping for an ortega chile but it was just a few slices of pickled jalapeno. I felt bored and kept thinking ""Why the eff didn't I order what I was craving????"". Fries on the other hand were crispy and hot. I dipped them in BBQ sauce and they were very good.  My wife's entree was excellent. I had a few bites and was very envious. She had the ""Vietnamese Caramel Chicken"". Holy shyte was this good. Chunks of chicken fried crispy in a thick golden batter tossed with green beans, onions, shitake mushrooms, sweet red peppers, in a spicy and sweet sauce. It was excellent and for $12.95 a great deal given the portion and quality. It was on a specials menu so not sure how long they'll have it for but I'd come back for it.

I told her, unfortunately this one was a smaller one and came directly out of the kitchen around the window that they have up on the booth. Our waiter even confirmed my fears and killed it for us!!! Good God I hope they get that addressed immediately, my stomach is turning just thinking about it! You spend way too much money at this place to get roach coach food..super sad! Super gross! The manager promised that they spray and get inspected often, but whatever the case...I will not be back anytime soon and don't know if I could get the courage to return even then.

My friend had a hard time trying to order something, and she went down the ENTIRE page of pastas, really explaining in details. She also picked the cheesecake flavor for us since we couldn't decide.

Did you think I wouldn't notice? A few years ago, what used to be a 7 inch-long, 3 inch-wide at the base wonderslice that satisfied my craving like no other cheesecake, has now become...much less. So very much less, indeed.. About half the volume, I'd say.  Or maybe, you thought that pathetic dollop of whipped cream lying there like an after thought would fool me into believing that a five inch slice was filling up the takeout container? Baby, I remember a few years ago when you'd send me home with a whole separate bowl's worth of topping goodness. That's the kind of love it used to take to match a Cheesecake Factory slice. Alas, no longer... Scoundrel! Why do restaurants feel the need to cheat their faithful customers? Are there none left who won't stoop to ""downsizing"" their portions while keeping the same prices?  At least Fresh N Easy still appreciates me. There, I can get an 8 inch ROUND cheesecake for the same cost as one of your adulterated SLICES. And it's DELICIOUS! And just for the record: 5 inches is *below* average, no matter what corporate may have told you. Your deceiver's heart no longer deserves my love, Cheesecake Factory. And so I bid you adieu..

Lynn T.,"Fountain Valley, CA",550,245,740,2.0,12/1/2013,"I've never been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but I was given a gift card for my birthday back in May so finally decided to use it yesterday (See how long it took me to use it? That's how much I don't really care for this place). When we arrived we were greeted right away and our names were taken down so we could be seated. We waited about 10 mins and was seated in the bar area that they now use for regular dining on the booths. When we sat down, were were told by our server that he would be right with us. We waited 5 mins for him to come back to finally ask what we would like to drink. He brought us back our waters and didn't come back again until we, took about 5 mins to decide what we wanted to eat and FINISHED our complimentary bread and waited some more to finally be able to wave him down to come take our orders.. (that was longer than it should have been) in case you weren't getting my drift.  We ended up ordering their Shrimp Bistro, Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and their Avocado eggrolls. The avocado eggrolls came out not too long after our order was placed... We finished the eggrolls and were ready for our entree.. we waited, waited and waited.. WAITED to the point that we started picking at the noodles that were used on the appetizer plate to place the eggrolls on. I NEARLY FINISHED the noodles! I was so hungry and waited so long for the food. We never waited that long for our food to come out before. I noticed other tables that ordered after us already got their salad and their food. The server finally came back and apologized for the wait and used the excuse that he wanted us to really enjoy our avocado eggrolls first.. UMMMM I NEARLY cleared the entire plate even the noodles cause you got me waiting so long here.. just bring me my food! Well.. to no surprise.. the food still was not ready and only came back later to tell me.. ""it'll just be a few more minutes"".... I do not want to hear that.. He finally decided to ask if we wanted our salad first so we decided to just have that.. We literally waited a good 20-30 mins before we got our food after waiting 10-15 mins to just get our order in. Not good! He finally brought us our pasta and we were finally happy.. The salad was not that great. It was HUGE! but the taste of it just wasn't good for me.. I had maybe two bites from it. The shrimp bistro was good though, I liked it a lot, but because of the long wait.. I just wasn't feeling it anymore. We ended up boxing up more then half of our salad and pasta after 15 mins of eating our food.  Service is a big deal to me, and I was not too happy with the service we received last night. I most likley will not be back unless I get another gift card or I have no choice. But I was never a fan of The Cheesecake Factory to begin with. After last night, it only made my decision on this place more valid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=480

This cheesecake factory, is clean, spacious, and had a good vibe to it. We went on a Friday night and only waited anout 15 minutes. We got a cute little table for two, the whole place has extremely dark lighting, we had to use our phones to view the menu. However, this made the ambient great for a romantic date. The menu had lots and lots of variety. I ordered the chipotle pasta, which i did not like, due to the sweet taste. I don't like my pastas to taste sweet, the waitress was nice enough to comp a new entree. The service was okay, our server was not very nice, but at least she accommodated my meal.

Duke D.,"Kyle, TX",342,108,502,4.0,4/1/2013,"Went here on the Saturday night before Easter Sunday because we were in the area. As soon as we entered, we knew the wait for indoor seating was going to be a while considering the amount of people crowding up the waiting area. So we asked for outdoor seating. Wait was only 10 minutes which was pleasantly surprising. Our waitress was prompt and courteous. Danielle was her name. Anyway, we ordered from the small plates menu since it was late and we didn't want a full on dinner plate. Here's what we got: Santorini Farro Salad Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries Fried Zucchini Roasted Pear & Bleu Cheese Flatbread (Pecans, Arugula and Caramelized Onions) For me the flatbread was the night's winner. Just nice balances among the savory, chewy and sweet. I wanted to do a second order to take home but was too full to get anymore. A good one to try out if you're there! In hindsight, we shouldn't have order the fried zucchini AND the Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries because the ""zucchini fries"" in the trio were the same as the ""fried zucchini"" order. Batter was okay. Nothing outstanding unless you dip it heavily in the provided dips, which I do not know what they were since we were never told about them as the orders arrived.  Outdoor setting was good. They had those lamp post heaters on so we were all nice and warm. Our waters were refilled promptly.

zheng y.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,136,4,1.0,4/25/2016,"Had two bad experiences here over the past month.  A friend and I live about 50 miles apart, so it is convenient to meet in the middle at Bella Terra. We tire of the noise at Islands and the menu at Romano's, so we tried Cheesecake Factory for variety. Two weeks ago, I ordered salmon rolls, and our male server, whose name I don't recall entered the order as shrimp rolls. Not being familiar with the CF menu, I began eating the rolls, only to find no salmon inside. Waiter was called, and he apologized and re-entered the correct order. By the time the salmon rolls came, my friend had finished his lunch, so the mis-order and poor timing made our lunch very unsatisfying. They made no effort to offer us any sort of compensation for the error, and we didn't ask, so we just chalked one up to poor service and bad attitude. This weekend, my friend, who enjoys CF more than I, suggested it again and I acceded. We got there at opening at 11, so it wasn't too busy yet. I ordered an omelette which was to include avocado, cheese and bacon. When the food came out, I began eating, and once again, after 4 of 5 minutes and a half dozen bites into the omelette, I realized no avocado had been included, called our server Marisa over, and returned it for correction. After a normal wait, the correct plate was served, but once again the timing of our meals was disrupted and Marisa was not genuinely a good server, not very attentive, and offered no form of compensation for the kitchen's error. In light of two similar experiences, with in one case a server's error and in one a kitchen error, I can only assume management does not encourage the servers to offer any discounts or desserts to compensate for such terrible service. These service errors must be a way of life there, so don't expect anyone to care if your meal is not right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=300

Pete S.,"Cypress, CA",473,1401,1557,4.0,5/17/2014,"Oh Cheesecake Factory, how my wide waist loves you. Not only do you offer one of the best cheesecakes around, you also make choosing dinner an incredible difficult task with your brochure like menu that is forever changing.  But what's great about you guys is that you have high employee morale and low turnover and considered Fortune top 100 companies to work for. Good for existing employees, not so good for people getting in.  I won't waste your time with mumbo jumbo what food to eat here. (except that I love the raspberry truffle cheesecake and someone should fire whoever took away the Thai Chicken pasta off the menu) Instead, you should know: Buying gift cards towards the end of the year. They will give out a certificate for a free cheesecake for every $25 gift card purchased. Last year, they offered 2 cheesecakes for each $25. My fat ass thanks you. I was lucky enough to get the ""golden ticket"" receipt that was worth $10 once. It's a survey for exchange for $10 GC.  They do have happy hour from M-F I believe 4-6 here. Certain appetizers are $5.  They have lunch portions that are good until 5pm. Cheaper fare. Some of the pastas I usually get are only $12.  Parking here in this location is incredibly difficult, you can call into go and there are 3 togo short term parking spots here. Oh why the 4 stars? Well, it's more like 4.5 but I think Cheesecake lost some of the glamour for me as the dining ""experience"" but I applaud you for consistency like Mikadees.

Firecracker Salmon appetizers is another favorite (apparantly there is a smaller version on the SkinnyLicious menu!)  They offer a GREAT raspberry Martini too. Yes, this place is a chain, but what they do, they do so well:  their service is usually efficient, friendly and the portions so big I always share with a friend.  Plus their cheesecakes are really delectable.   The only thing I dislike:  they are famous for long waits during busy times... ah, well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=300
L M.,"Signal Hill, CA",2,23,7,5.0,1/11/2014,Markelle P- please read. I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience at Cheesecake Factory but you have blamed the wrong server. The lady who served you was not Lisa C.  She was actually on break and did not speak with you at all. They share the cash register and so her name was on the receipt even though she didn't serve you. You are disparaging her good name and that's not fair.  Please go in to Cheesecake Factory and see for yourself.  Lisa is a great bartender!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=600
Mitchell W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,37,9,5.0,7/6/2015,"I must say I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in quite a while. My review is mostly focused on the food because we had a pretty horrible customer service aspect of dinner but it was out of the control of the staff so I won't blame them. I expect a pretty good quality of food for the prices and location and was overwhelmingly surprised at how great everything was. Started with a super manly (sarcasm) Peach Bellini (sp?) and it was amazing. Very few places I have been can nail this fairly simple drink like they did. I ordered two more. I cannot remember the exact name of my dish but it was some sort of Steak Diane or something like that. It was the best steak and potatoes dish I have had so far in Huntington Beach. Absolutely amazing sauce with flawless sides as if the dish needed to be any more amazing. My cousin also got the Gumbo or jambalaya dish, and it was also amazing. Perfect amount of spicy while still being deliciously seasoned. I must say I am sad to hear that the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake was taken off the menu. Lots of good choices of cheesecake but not many for people like me who don't want a overly rich cake. Overall definitely worth the money and will be returning as soon as my little college budget can afford it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=600

American style Kobe beef is an oxymoron.  The noodles in the pasta dish were so over cooked it fell apart and didn't taste right. The menu had too much writing, advertisement and the word specialties appeared too many times. they try to cover to many denominations of food.

Jason A.,"Cerritos, CA",1079,700,1631,4.0,10/26/2009,"This is the closest Cheesecake Factory to my work, so I come here once in a while and when they have crazy promotions.  My first time at this particular location was during their anniversary last year when they had 50% off all cheesecakes. Man alive, there were people flooding the main entrance all trying to get a slice or two...or three. Now, I do admit that getting most cheesecake aficionados tend to be of the larger variety, so I could be exaggerating when I say there were a lot of people in the doorway. It may have been just a couple really big ones.  Nonetheless, I realized that it would probably be faster and more efficient to just ask for a table and eat lunch...THEN order a slice of cheesecake to go! See, that's how you maximize your lunch break and still take advantage of the promotion.  I had the Da Vinci pasta and decided to take a chocolate Godiva cheesecake to go, since it's more chocolate than actual cheese. Though I've never been a large fan of cheesecake, seeing the richness of the chocolate made me reconsider my stance and give it a try.  I could feel my ass get larger with every bite once I took it back to the office. I knew this was bad and made a promise to light some incense in front of a picture of my dead relatives to bring me some good luck in ridding myself of this chocolaty goodness.  I ended up just fasting for the rest of the day and ran a few hours on a treadmill when I got home that day. Good enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=600

Within 30 minutes we were seated outside and I was amazed to see how nice the outside seating was! However, it was a bit cold and uncomfortable (and i was scared of bugs or ants). Our server didn't come by often enough, and we didn't have any plates to put our bread on.  I always hate how the menu at cheesecake is sooooo long!! I've always had the chicken bellagio but this time I got the chicken marsala and I LOVED IT!!!! I think that's what I'll get from now on. Although our server disappeared a lot, he was really nice.

But sure enough about 15mins later our name was called. Yaaaayy!!! We were all getting hungry and couldn't wait to order. We got seated and a few mintues later our waiter came and took our drink orders. When our drinks arrived he took our food order since we were all ready and not too long after our appetizier came out then our food. We are liking the fast service! The hubby got the louisiana chicken pasta which he said was good. I stole a bite and it was tastey. Nancy got the garlic noodles which is one of my faves. She enjoyed it. And I had the romano crusted chicken. It was salty! I mean it was like they poured salt all over my chicken and soaked my pasta in salt. It was unedible. Even Nancy took a bite and could not believe it. I had to send it back and our waiter was nice enough to ask whether I wanted a different dish or the same after he explained why it was too salty. I asked for the same and after a few minutes my new dish was out. He waited until I tried it before he left and it was perfect. So tastey and not salty at all! Thats great service.

This came with mashed potato in the middle and a nice big piece of salmon, brushed with herbs, placed in the middle. The whole plate came with a creamy, yet vinegary sauce that paired extremely well with both the salmon and mashed potatoes. The brown bread that they give you in the beginning is absolutely divine, especially when paired with this dish. So so great!

Jenni I.,"Huntington Beach, CA",246,277,40,4.0,6/13/2012,"Great food, good service. Parking at bella terra is okay. They usually don't check the 40 minute spots (or we've just been lucky? extremely lucky? every single time? maybe). The wait was about 20 minutes... We were given a buzzer so that we could walk around the shopping center, though I'm not sure why they buzzed us if they weren't going to seat us right away.... Who knows. In any case, I ordered the shepherds pie (not what I expected it to be but I guess I should've read the description better...) and my bf got the filet mignon... which was meh in his opinion. On an unrelated note, they've gotten kind of cheap with their bread and gave only one roll of sourdough (I think it's sourdough) and one roll of squaw bread (but I'm sure if you asked they'll bring you more). The shepherds pie was good, but the meat wasn't what I expected. I thought I had read ""shredded beef"" which was actually more like... hamburger meat. Meh, I still like hamburgers... but my palate was not ready for that. It also comes with yummy mashed potatoes on top and is cooked with peas, carrots, and mushroom. I will say that the portion for the shepherds pie was HUGE. I'm still eating my leftovers and I think I'll be good for another meal (making three meals total) The filet mignon came with fries originally, but my bf switched it to mashed potatoes (it also came with two rather large onion rings, haha). He didn't really like the presentation. I'm not sure if he was completely full and satisfied with his meal. Prices are decent for what you get. Waitress was attentive and brought us many many waters (we were thirsty! what can I say~) Overall, it was a good meal, but I knocked off a star because we both seemed unsatisfied with our food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=600

Then, that's about as far as it goes... Waitress was slow in taking down our orders (both for drinks and meal), promised to bring bread, but it took her forever, promised to also check on my dessert, but it took her an excruciatingly long time.  Basically, our waitress was MIA for most of our meal and when she did come by to refill a drink, I had to wince every single time she hurriedly slammed down our drinks and rushed away.  Where are you rushing to?!?

He took our drink order, my BF had the tea in passion-fruit, and I had a frozen strawberry margarita. Having been to many bars, I am a bit picky. Margarita was not very sweet even when I asked for sugar on the rim. I'd give the margarita alone a 7/10. We had ordered beef kabobs for appetizers, and then I decided on the filet mignon, and BF had ordered fish and chips. So the atmosphere is nice outside, cute patio, you know. We wait about twenty-five minutes and our dinner is served. Filet was yummy, and BF enjoyed his fish and chips. About halfway into our meal.... Our beef kabobs come. Talk about awkward.. Anyway..

Westley Y.,"Fountain Valley, CA",86,436,1415,2.0,5/6/2014,"This Restaurant is located on the backside of the Bella Terra Shopping Center. The Cheesecake Factory is best known across the globe for its extensive and creative menu, generous portions, distinctive decor and legendary desserts. With more than 250 menu selections - all handmade, in-house with fresh ingredients - and more than 50 signature cheesecakes and desserts, there is truly ""Something for everyone"" at The Cheesecake Factory. It was my Mom's Birthday and she got a gift card from one of her co-workers so we all when out on a Tuesday night for Birthday dinner. When we arrived we were greeted right away which was nice. I gave them our name and within a few minutes they took us to our table. We sat in the giant booth that fits 7 people in the center of the room. Everything was looking good so far. Our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed and tired she was saying weird thing but we took it with a grain of salt. We told her were just sat down and needed a few minutes to look over what we wanted to order. Well we shouldn't have said that because literally she never came back. Ha ha we waiting for like 20 minutes an then I said enough of this so I waved down another server to get us started with Drinks. I know just drink right. Horrible!  Then when it came time to order our food our same original server came back and she was a wreck, she looked horrible. Her hair was a mess and all sweaty and it seem like she was inconvenienced to take our order.  I was thinking at that time if I were her boss I would have had a talk with her saying either get it together or go home. We ordered our food and each plate had different things that were requested and of course when we got our meal it was missing sides and not cooked the way we wanted it so on and so forth. The recap was their service level was a 1 out of 10 and they food was okay but not what we expected.

As the holidays are approaching, I wanted to see the holiday hours for this Cheesecake Factory since it's near where I live and I was craving some cheesecake. Today was Thursday and they closed at 11pm. I figured when I called (it was 12:45am), it would just send me to the automated voicemail and I would hear the holiday hours. To my surprise, a girl picked up. Employee: Cheesecake Factory Me: Hi. I was wondering what your holiday hours were for this weekend? Employee: ...Are you serious? Me: Yes. Employee: Well we're open til 12:30 on Friday and Saturday and closed on Christmas Day. Me: Okay, thanks so much. Employee: Yeah. Really? I'm sorry if you had to stay back late. I'm glad that you picked up the phone, but honestly, if you're gonna be that rude, I'd rather you not pick up the phone at all and just let the message play.

Nikki M.,"El Segundo, CA",471,346,117,4.0,11/19/2011,"We've all bene to Cheesecake Factory. But what makes this one different? It has a happy hour, that's what! Only a few locations in the US actually have a HH, so this makes bump up the rating from what would usually be a three star review for any other Cheesecake Factory location. So please, bare in mind... *This review is for the happy hour only"" Don't even get me started on corporate restaurants, Cheesecake's ANNOYING long menu, or their overly sweet cheesecakes. I'll review the happier, more alcoholic side to Cheesecake. My friend and I were trying to figure out a spot for happy hour, and Bella Terra happened to be located conveniently for both of us. She suggested Cheesecake Factory. ""Say whatttt? They have a happy hour,"" I responded. ""Yep!"" And we were on our way. I've been back once since my first time. They have a nice selection of cocktails on happy hour (including my favorite cosmo) as well as deals on beer and a few varietals of wine (chard, cab, merlot, sauv blanc, and pinot...if I remember correctly). They also have a GREAT selection of food on happy hour, including appetizers and small plates that range from $5-8ish. The first time I came, I ordered a glass of the sauv blanc and the grilled artichoke. Artichoke = perfection, with a garlicky aioli. We have a winner! Second time, I was back with a big group - beers, cosmo, mojito (which was made incorrectly and was wayyyy to sweet and reminded me of why I don't usually like Cheesecake), and sauv blanc/pinot were all ordered by us. One friend ordered the spinach artichoke dip, which turned out be my favorite this time, and another friend and I spitl the crab artichoke dip (this was pretty meh). We also ordered the greek salad and gorgonzola salad. All of this was on happy hour. Someone else at the table also ordered mac and cheese and said it was pretty good. Of all of the stuff we've tried, this is only the tip of the iceberg for the happy hour menu, and happy hour menus are usually pretty short. Nice selection of both food and drinks, all for reasonable prices. Good pick for happy hour!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=580

However, I am not sure if it was because of the nice weather, our server, or it being Sunday Brunch, but the patio service was very very slow. It took 20 minutes to get our cocktails- I had walked to the restroom and myself being a bartender knew what to look for as I passed the bar and noticed our drinks sitting there. Our food was quite slow to hit the table, and I am not sure if it was our server's first busy patio shift, but the pre-bussing, bussing, and check presentation took way too long.  The food was in large and delicious portions when it did arrive and the patio atmosphere was gorgeous and inviting on this scorching heat wave.

Nick S.,"Orange County, CA",763,94,123,4.0,10/3/2014,"You know that old saying ""There ain't no celebration like a cheesecake celebration""?  Well I just made it up and it applies to your life now.    We came here last night to celebrate my girlfriend's new job!  Wooo cheesecake!... I mean congrats babe?  Anyways, after a quick 10 minute wait (Thursday night), we got our booth for 4.  The service here is always very nice, but also consistently slow.  For example, our water would always check in with us every time he walked by, but when we asked for more bread, it wasn't at our table for another 10 mintues.  I think the servers there are maybe a bit understaffed because they always seem to be rushing somewhere to help with another table.   Drinks: I'm the only table alcoholic, so I was the only one to order a drink.  I got a Hendricks Tonic w/ Lime and Cucumber and I gotta say they have pretty heavy pours here.  definitely not complaining though haha. Food: I'm actually not a really big fan of their food here.  We always seem to get calamari for the app and without fail, each time we order it, it gets smaller and smaller!  Last night's calamari was a plate with a napkin folded in half on it, with the actual calamari only put on top of that half napkin... it was honestly only good for 1 person's worth of food.  For entrees, my lady for some unbeknownst reason, swears by their chicken fettecini alfredo with sun dried tomatoes.  I guess she really loves bland sauce tossed with store bought (my guess) pasta and a couple of sun dried tomatoes thrown on top... but who knows?  maybe I'm the one with a terrible palate.  I ordered the chicken little - fried chicken breast strips with mash and veggies.  Let me clarify, this plate isn't bad, but also isn't great.  I only got it because I remembered it was huge - and this time was no exception.  After getting some sriracha (obviously), I devoured the plate and was definitely full. Dessert: Our awesome waiter came up to us towards the end of our meal and apologized for the slow service.  To make up for it, he actually threw in a free slice of cheesecake!  *CUE heavens opening up and harp music. We let him surprise us with his favorite underrated slice and a minute later he showed up with a S'Mores Cheesecake slice.  I was a bit skeptical, but after my first bite, SOLD!  The S'mores CC is amazing here.  It comes with a golden brown marhmellow melted over a rich creamy chocolate cheesecake, topped with whipped cream.  I don't think I wouldve been able to finish it by myself, so sharing was perfect for us 4. Overall:  4/5 stars.  I totally understand their slower service, and definitely appreciated the free slice at the end!  Food, meh...

Ariana S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/16/2014,"Came in on Monday evening around 9pm with my partner on a date.  Let me start by saying the server was really nice, the timing of the food was perfect, and the food itself was delicious.  However, when we got there and asked for a table outside, the host said no. As I have worked in the restaurant industry for ten years (until last week :D ), I understand about sections closing, etc. However, what is the point of closing a desirable outside patio section at 9pm when you don't close the restaurant for another two hours and I could see several tables out there eating their dinners on the walk up. Be accommodating! That's your job. Besides, we would have tipped well. At the end of our meal, we had only eaten half of the food because it was a lot (we had each ordered combination plates). The server took it to box it up, and did not return for a while. When she did, it was to inform us that ""someone accidentally threw it away and the kitchen is cooking new food"" for us. No worries! We thought, well now we will have extra food, which is always cool. We got desert and eventually she delivered three boxes in a bag which was our replacement to go food.  When we got home and looked inside, there were no mashed potatoes at all, despite the fact that there had been A LOT of the tasty potatoes left originally. Also, there was a very small amount of steak in one box, which we had each left half of on our plates. The chicken and salmon were fine. I just don't understand why, after paying 90$ for our meal and tipping 20%, this was acceptable. I don't know if it was the servers memory, the kitchen manager being cheap, or just people not caring.  At any rate, we probably won't go back. I'm sure they can be good and it was just a fluke, but when you are spending over 100$ on a meal, ""somebody"" should not throw your food away and ""somebody"" should not forget to replace it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=360
Em H.,"Garden Grove, CA",16,91,153,1.0,5/10/2015,"I have been to this location probably 3 times, and tonight was the fourth and need to write a review about this. My first time was years ago with my ex and I was young didn't know much about food. Came here 2 time with my bf and my taste bud has changed over the years. I DIDNT like what I ordered. I came here third times with my parents and my kid...my experience and taste bud still has not changed one bit. We waited over an hour for a frozen cheesecake, was not fresh when order so we cancelled.  Let's make the story short. I had GNO tonight and one of my girlfriend wants to come here because she craved for Hibachi steak. I have told them how I dislike this place and food are so terrible. They convinced me and I decided to give another try.  My experience tonight: order mojito during happy hour. The drink contains mild of alcohol and too much ice. (No wonder it's on happy hour menu)  Calamari: the only dish that we finished and taste good. The bad thing about this there were 2 popcorn chicken in our calamari. The manager came to our table informed us one of the plate gonna take another 10 minute because they have to change season. Told her there were chicken in our calamari, her respond? ""Oh, I'm sorry. Let me check in the kitchen and make sure it won't happen again.""  I order Diane steak, well done (can't stand pink...weh weh) first of all, most of my pieces are burnt, therefore, I cut off most of the layers. Mash potatoes cold outside but warm inside. Very odd...usually a well prepared food from a fine restaurant should be hot....not under room temperature to cold. Even my mushroom was cold, not warm but cold.

The white rice in my miso salmon was quite undercooked.  It was still very hard. The steak diane (one of my favs) was overcooked. I had ordered medium rare. The medallions came out medium and therefore lost its juiciness. Mashed potato was on point -soft and buttery. Lastly, I had the garlic chicken noodle. Noodle was al dente so no issue there. However, the bf bite into the drumstick and found the chicken undercooked.  I should have taken a picture of it. The chicken inside was between red and borderline pink.  I told the waitress to please tell the chefs that the chicken was not fully cooked.  She took out plates and that was it. No acknowledgement.

However service seems to slow down, when are getting ready to for our check -  2 1/2 stars. But I really come here for the cheesecake! - 5 stars ...to go of course or we'll go next door to Starbucks and have coffee with our cheesecake!

Ammi B.,"San Diego, CA",29,8,,5.0,1/26/2016,"I'm not a big fan of Cheesecake Factory food, but I've always loved their cheesecakes. This review is mostly in regards to the service at the Bella Terra location, because the cheesecake was, as always, very delicious. My friend and I came here last week dessert and were seated immediately. We were brought water right after we sat down, and after we ordered, the food came out fast and our waitress stopped by regularly to check on us. The table we were seated at was in the line of direct afternoon sunlight, and for some reason, they decided to raise the shades and let in more piercing light, but I'm still going to give 5 stars 'cause we loved our waitress (the gal with the chin-length red hair)-- nicest, most genuine server ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=400

My brother and sister had fish and chips and meatball & spaghetti (my sister liked this, but felt it was a little too salty.

First of all, the hosts/hostesses said it would be a 10 minute wait which turned into more than half an hour! I even heard another couple get annoyed at this. Our server (Martha) would literally SLAM every single plate on our table, practically spear-tossed a straw into my drink with her bare hands (ew), hardly checked on us and was just overall snotty and condescending. She high-key even had the audacity to check if we left a tip before she took our check away, as if she deserved it. Martha is the worst server ever! Food was quite disappointing. I got my favorite Chicken di Pana; broccoli was overcooked, the ""creamy sauce"" just tasted like heavy cream with no seasoning and some parts of my mashed potatoes were cold. My boyfriend got the Fried Chicken platter, he said it was okay and that the corn was good but it looked like a fancier version of what you can get at KFC. Lol. On the bright side, the calamari wasn't half bad. The fact that we had a snot-nosed brat stuck inside a 30-35 year old woman's body as a server kind of irked our experience. Ps.

We had 8 people in our party on Monday, May 25,2015 at 6:00 p.m. Rebecca was our waitress. I think she did her best in a stressful situation. I ordered the tomato chicken with pasta off the Skinny Menu. One of our guest arrived about 6:30 . His food was served before the other seven people. The rest of the dishes were served about 20 minutes later.  I noticed immediately that my food was lukewarm. I ask the waitress to take it back and reheat it. The remaining seven dishes were not heated properly. I ate the chicken in the second dish that was served. The noodles were hard and the tomatoes looked like they had been heated repeatedly. A green sauce was at the bottom of the dish but I was so hungry by the time my second serving came that I did eat the chicken and I relayed this information to Rebecca. There were several other waiters that were helping Rebecca. I am so sorry that CCF service and food has reached a new low because I have enjoyed insurmountable meals there and I sincerely hope this was just a bad night for the waiters and cooks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=440

There were two men that passed us in black shirts, obviously not waiters, but they didn't even acknowledge the fact that no one had served us yet. The waiter came by our table and asked my siblings if anyone had taken our order yet. He took our order and a party that came after us at the same time. When he brought out the bread the white one was super stale! My teeth were literally aching so much after trying to eat it I had to take an Tylenol but that didn't even help much. Im here writing this review 4 hours later and it still hurts. And I only ate it cause I was so hungry waiting. The waiter didn't apologize or try to make up it he just said thanks for your patience. The other people's tables were checked up on and well taken care of maybe because they were all adults and my party just looked like a bunch of kids. The food was mediocre. I would never waste my time and money coming back here again. This experience ruined our weekly lunch date. Such a waste of $85 dollars.

For Valentine's Day, I think we waited about an hour and a half to be seated. They were really crowded that night, but that's understandable. The second time, which was on a Thursday night, we only had to wait about 15 minutes. When we got seated, we found that it was very dim inside, so it was hard to see. It also took a long time for the food to come out. They basically have everything on their menu. They have a great selection of food -- burgers, pasta, salad, etc. Before we ordered, we got different types of bread and butter. The whole wheat bread is SO good. Their bread is unlimited too so you can ask them for more! When it was time to order, my boyfriend and I went for their pasta. He ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta and he loved it! I hate mushrooms but I also liked what I tasted of his pasta. It had a nice creamy flavor to it. His chicken was also tasty. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle chicken pasta and thought it was super delicious! It's now my favorite pasta -- it has the perfect hint of spice and the perfect crunch, since they top it off with bits of tortilla chips (I think).  Their cheesecake slice is really big... I totally underestimated it. We ordered the Oreo cheesecake to share but it got soo sweet that we couldn't finish it.

Now the good stuff: wheat bread?  Whatever the darker bread they start you off with. It's bomb. Ask for more. The cheesecakes. Omg love. It's not frou frou fancy gourmet dessert but damn it's good. Rich and ridiculously fattening. Everything a guilty dessert is suppose to be. The Godiva is a must for chocolate lovers and the S'mores cheesecake is just as amazing as it sounds.

I've had the chicken marsala, grilled salmon, shrimp pasta, and calamari. - I love the ambiance of this place because of the low lighting, the low murmuring sound of people talking, and the marble floor and columns. - The waiters are pretty attentive to your needs. Even if they are constantly running around, they always stop by to ask if you need anything several times. - They give you a buzzer so you can browse the shops in the mall while you wait to be seated.  CONS: - There is usually a wait on nights and weekends that can last more than 1 hr. I don't go here for regular meals because I can't afford the time to wait. I only go here occasionally.  - It can be a little pricey here. - One time I had the shrimp pasta and it was super salty!

I should have a table permanently reserved for me at Starbucks and here at the Cheesecake Factory because my internet dating turn-over rate is pretty high.  Sometimes I have second dates here, but they're rare.  No one has yet to move on to the elusive third date. But enough about my relationship issues...  There's always a long wait for a table here.  Partly because if it's location within the busy bustling Bella Terra. You're competing for a table with lots of movie-goers, casual shoppers and other couples who appear to be in happy committed relationships (not that I'm envious or anything..) Once you get your coveted table, you'll quickly realize that on a crowded evening it's a little diffcult to carry on a conversation. There's so much noise!  So while you're sitting there talking about your hobbies, interests and perhaps even your past relationship you realize that you're straining to be heard by your date across the table.  ""SO YEAH, WE BROKE UP BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T COMMIT.....""

Our server, took one persons drink order, then walked away. Returned with a drink, then I jumped in and ordered a drink, ""sure, no problem"" but then walked away again before getting drink requests from the rest of the group. Not cool.  The drink, some strawberry boozy concoction was amazing.  Food was ok, I had some pasta thing that I picked out of their literally 13 page menu, and it was tasty enough.  I really enjoyed the real/fresh parmesan cheese.  I had a strawberry shortcake for dessert, everyone else had cheesecake and we were all happy....that is until the people seated directly behind us got their overly fishy smelling fish entree which permeated the air, making everything else taste fishy. Mango/Keylime/fishy cheesecake isn't awesome. Whatever, they can order what they want, but did they really need to be seated RIGHT behind us in the totally deserted restaurant?  Then, the shocker. Lunch for 4 people was $140. Food was ok, service was ok, drinks were ok, but not a hundred and forty friggen dollars ok.  Also, after we finished eating and paid, I stopped into the bakery to pick up a cheesecake my mom had requested. Sure, no problem, they charged my card, I stood around for 10 minutes until a manager told me they didn't have the kind I wanted. They refunded my card and gave me a slice of what they did have for free, so ok,,fine. Although I don't know if the free slice of cheesecake was intentional or not, either way, after a $40 per person after tax/tip meal, I'll take my $7 slice free, thanks.

J J.,"Westminster, CA",1,80,5,3.0,5/29/2011,"I have been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for years now.  Never had a ""bad"" experience before. In fact, it is usually pretty good. Today, not so much. I am without husband and kids for the weekend (I have to work) so I decided to treat myself to a little shopping (bought stuff for the kids, of course) and brunch. Since I was by myself, I headed to the bar, eager for a glass of champagne, eggs benedict, and reading my book. The bartender greeted me immediately. I asked her what she like and the first thing she said was the benedict with spinach, bacon and tomatoes. I took her suggestion, ordered my champagne and opened my Kindle. Food came out about 10 minutes later.  Potatoes were nice and hot and the eggs were cooked to perfection (I order them poached medium because I don't like them too runny). Only problem was that the were COLD (gross!). I let the bartender know and she was apologetic. She told the manager who also came over to apologize and assured me the next order would be hot.  So about 10 minutes went by and the new plate of food arrives. Potatoes were hot, eggs were warm and way too runny. I chose not to say anything because it really did taste good. Then I noticed that the tomatoes that menu describes as 'grilled' were raw. Again, I chose not to say anything because I like raw tomatoes. I take another bite and realize something is missing. THE BACON!! I bring it to the bartender attention and again she is apologizing. She orders a side of bacon, but by the time I get it, I am almost done and my eggs are cold. I still add it to a few more bites and admit it tasted even better. A little too late, though. The manager comps my meal and the bartender keeps apologizing. But it really is not the end of the world. I enjoyed my food (overall), the champagne was yummy, and I got to eat in peace and quiet without having to tell my kids to hurry up and eat. The bartender gave great service (she deserves 5 stars!) and I felt bad 'complaining'  because I know she was busy. The 3 stars had nothing to do with her - just the kitchen. So with that being said, I know I will be back. I just hope I enjoy my next visit a little bit more.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=720
Lilli S.,"Long Beach, CA",148,96,,2.0,3/19/2010,"Oh no! Your having a business lunch, or a first date, or getting dragged along with your group of friends that don't know any better to the CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!  AHHHHHHHH!!!!  I know, I know, it sounds horrible, but trust me, you don't have to cancel your lunch meeting, tell your date your busy washing your hair or spend the night wishing you had smarter friends, but you do have to order smart; considering the menu is like a freaking encyclopedia with advertisements, its not always easy. Make sure to refer to yelp reviews should you start to feel nervous.  I'm no fan of Cheesecake Factory or its sister restaurant Grand Lux Cafe, but I'm also not a fan of being Debbie Downer I cant eat there super snob. Whenever I'm forced to partake at these not so fine establishments, I follow one rule:  Keep it simple  The only things I order here are the guacamole with chips. Shockingly the guacamole is pretty fresh. The Tuna Tataki Salad, the tuna is only lightly seared, and completely pink in the middle, so you know it wasn't bathed in preservatives before taking a months long sabbatical in your restaurants freezer. Not even the wizards behind deep fried macaroni balls have come up with a way to make frozen tuna look fresh......for now. If neither of those options sound appealing just be a fatty and/or a drunk and order deserts and/or drinks only. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is actually pretty good, I think Godiva must hold them to some higher standards.  The one thing you definitely under no circumstances order is the cashew chicken. Once you've eaten it, your committed to tasting it for at least the next 4 days. No amount of tooth brushing, extra strength Listerine, Clorox, oxyclean, engine degreaser, chemical peels, oral ablation or just straight acid will remove that taste from your mouth. Its punishment I think for eating at Cheesecake factory in the first place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=720

Minerva T.,"Pflugerville, TX",236,331,1844,4.0,12/31/2010,"I like going to Cheesecake Factory but I definitely made a special trip because I read that they had peppermint bark cheesecake in season. It was fantastic! The bread here is always great. I am a sucker for sourdough but have also been won over by the honey wheat they have as well. Their complimentary slices are warm and have great crustiness. The sourdough is not too sour either. If you're a lover of sweeter breads, try the honey wheat. Well actually, since they bring out however much you want, try both! The only problem is that you might get full eating the bread since it's so good - save yourself for all of the food that will come though! To feel fancy, I decided that I'd have myself a cocktail. Now, I'm not a big fan of vodka only because it's pretty much in everything. I mean, I don't hate it - I just don't prefer it, especially if I'm going to pay handsomely for a drink. This cut down my choices on the menu considerably but I did eventually find something to quench my thirst: the Blackjack Martini. It even sounds cool! It was basically a Manhattan with blackberry and Jack Daniel's. I found it quite tasty and hardly noticeable in terms of alcohol taste. My only quibble with this drink was that it was much too expensive. Generally restaurants don't put the prices on the menu for drinks, but from what I've seen, they range from $6-$8 or so at casual-type restaurants. That was my guess. You can imagine my surprise when $11.50 appeared on the bill. I was disappointed in the price and now know not to have a cocktail at Cheesecake Factory again. My friend's Red Raspberry Martini was the same price for a smaller quantity I believe. After much scrutiny of the menu (so many choices), I finally opted for the Bistro Shrimp Pasta dish, which has battered shrimp, mushrooms, tomato, and arugula mixed with spaghettini in a basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce. It came in at $16.95 for the dish, a bit hefty but in the general price range for the pasta dishes. If you ordered this and expected crispy shrimp, you'd be disappointed because the shrimp was a bit soft. I didn't' mind though and actually preferred it; it was more fitting for the dish. I loved the inclusion of the fresh vegetables, especially the arugula. The spaghettini was prepared to just the right texture for pasta - cooked thoroughly but with enough hardness left in it to give you something to chew on; I guess it's what you would call ""al dente,"" or ""to the teeth"" in Italian. I'm a spaghettini and angel hair lover when it comes to noodle-y pastas, so this was a great choice for me. As for the sauce, it definitely made the whole entree worthwhile. I was wary of its advertisement as a cream sauce but the lemon made it light and delicious. I felt like the arugula was complemented well by the garlicky sauce. The portion was too much for me to have but I didn't mind taking it home for some more eating later. The whole reason for going - Peppermint Bark Cheesecake (a white chocolate cheesecake swirled with chunks of chocolate peppermint bark and topped with white chocolate mousse and finished with chopped peppermint). Though we were nearly popping our pants' buttons from the abundance of deliciousness we had, there was room to finish this off. Of course, my two friends and I shared this because we were afraid we wouldn't be able to handle individual slices. It was FANTASTIC. Unlike some of their cheesecakes there (I sure have tried a lot), this one was not too heavy. It's possible that that was an illusion caused by the inclusion of peppermint but either way, it did not make us stop after the first bite. The creaminess of the body was light enough to suggest that it had been whipped up a few times. The chocolate crust had been softened by the slice itself, and I could hardly taste it with all of the mint. I think the topping of the cheesecake with bits of peppermint was great, giving something to break with one's teeth and also to highlight the peppermint swirls in the cheese part itself. My only complaint is that they don't have this cheesecake year-round - I would surely buy it many times!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=720

We wanted to watch the end of the NFL playoff game, so we opted to sit at the bar--not IN the bar area, but physically AT the bar. We didn't get any alcoholic bevies, and felt a little bad, but the two bartenders were fabulous and didn't make us feel weird at all. We did get a raspberry lemonade (SUPER tasty but very sweet) and passion fruit iced tea (pretty  much the BEST iced tea I've ever had).  We decided to share 2 lunch specials--the thai pasta and the barbeque ranch chicken salad. The salad was super fresh and cold--tasted delicious on a nice day like today. The pasta was good, but hubby ate it first so by the time I got it, it was more of the bottom of the pasta, and there was too much sauce. I liked the bean sprouts for a nice crunch, tho, and overall it was tasty. The lunch portions were huge! More than enough for a hungry person, and we both left feeling full. Sometimes when you sit at the bar the service sucks, but that was definitely not the case here. The bartenders were great--friendly, attentive, and our food came out quickly. I wish I always got great service like this when sitting at a restaurant bar! We walked out of there with a total of about $35, for lunch for 2 with two non-alcoholic bevies and 2 lunch portions of food... including tax and tip. Not horrible.

I've eaten here a few times, but have never written a review before. This trip sparked a need to write a review. Our server, Andre, was exceptional, attentive, and happy, but not overbearing.  The only complaints and issues I have are with the food. I ordered the ""Cajun Chicken 'Littles.'"" With a name like that, I expected a few pieces of a spicy breaded friend chicken.  When another server brought out the PLATTER, I was blown away. It was a platter of fried chicken tenders enough to feed 4 people; it was more like a giant appetizer for a table of people. You get your monies worth with the portion size, but the ""cajun"" chicken had no cajun flavor at all. Big thumbs down. KFC chicken has more flavor than the ""Cajun Chicken 'Littles!'""  Even the honey mustard dipping sauce was weak. I love chicken tenders, but I really wanted something with a kick. The mashed potatoes, which they serve without gravy, were also on the bland and boring side, and to top this off the mashed potatoes were COLD. I had to ask the server to bring me another serving which ended up being warmer than the cold mashed potatoes, but not much warmer than room temp. Sad face.

I have to split everything with at least one other person, but mostly everything is tasty and delectable.  My favorite staples are: 1) Chicken Madeira (this dish is WONDERFUL if you substitute Mahi Mahi instead of the chicken). The caramelized sauce tastes delicious with the fish. I usually tell the waitress I want the MAHI MAHI Madeira and they give me this confused look at first .. and then curiosity. Most of them order it to try afterwards, and have told me that this is their new favorite dish here. The downside: sometimes they charge you a lot for the substitution. If you get a nice server, they'll just leave the price as is. 2) BLT Salad. I always substitute the bacon dressing with Ranch dressing.  I'm not a big fan of lettuce, but this salad is surprisingly refreshing. Since its not a heavy salad, but just an appetizer dish, I love splitting this salad and the Mahi Mahi Madeira with my boyfriend. It's the perfect size meal for two.  3) White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake is my favorite dessert here. The others tend to be too rich for me, but this one goes perfectly with some English Breakfast tea.  4) Sangria:  I never thought I'd like the Sangria here. A bunch of us got drinks after a final, and maybe I was delirious from studying, but this Sangria was surprisingly good.  5) Mojito: Doesn't compare to Mercedes Grill at all, but still quite good. Lots of mint,  well done.  Don't Get:  1) California Omelet: bland bland bland. Too thick and dry.  2) Thai Chicken Pasta: go to a Thai restaurant if you want Thai food.

Took me good 20 minutes to find a freaking parking space. So you've been warned.

Johnny C.,"Cerritos, CA",328,805,133,3.0,12/3/2010,"Its been years since i've been to cheesecake factory. Went last night (thursday) and our party was seated already, but there was a waiting list for the other people. The place is pretty dimly lit which makes it difficult sometimes figuring out what you're eating, unless they're trying to hide something ... like the pool of oil at the bottom of the plate or the measly pieces of chicken on your pasta. Got a 22oucne stella so i was pretty much fine with everything otherwise. So many cheesecake choices that it makes me not want to get any.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=560
Benjamin B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/14/2014,"I'm writing this review for 6/12/14 Thursday night. First off, I gotta say if you don't valet your car then you're missing out, but that isn't a part of The Cheesecake Factory. So my girlfriend and I got there and immediately I checked in and the host told me 10-15 minutes for a party of two. As soon as I got the pager, I turned around to wait outside, but I only made it to the door and the pager went off. I saw they printed out my name with a table number on it and I was like wow that was fast. I overheard a party of 5 would take 30-45 minutes to be seated. These hosts were awesome and I think that hosts are under appreciated in the restaurant business. So we sit down at our 2 top table and it's a little small and usually I would have asked for a booth, but on a busy night, I was lucky to get a table as fact as I did, so I wasn't about to ask to move. Our server was Kenny and he was great. I ordered 2 waters and an ultimate margarita for my girlfriend and I. Kenny brought them along with the bread. I took a drink of my Ultimate Margarita and it was too sweet, so I stirred it a bit, but it was still too sweet (wasn't his fault maybe the bartender messed up or CF's recipe uses alot of sweet and sour). So when Kenny came around I told him that my margarita had too much sweet and sour and that I wanted to get a mojito instead and it was delicious. Then we ordered our appetizers, spinach dip and potstickers, and our meal at the same time, Meatloaf and Chicken Madeira, the only problem with the appetizers was that the spinach dip was too cold, so I asked Kenny to heat it up abit and he did, easy fix. The manager came around as our food came out to apologize about the wait. My girlfriend and I didn't even notice the wait. I saved room for dessert and Kenny packed up all our leftovers for us and even gave us great recommendations for dessert. We were full so we decided to order our dessert to-go and eat it when we got home. We got the Kahlua cheesecake and the reese cup cheesecake for our roommates. Kenny brought our check and we had about $88 and 20% is about $17-$18, but we didn't want to break any bills, so we left him $110. That's $22 tip.  To you cheapsakes out there! That's how you tip properly, so take a lesson. Our service was sublime nothing to really complain about, so to those people that find a problem every time. Get over yourself. Maybe the reason you have bad costumer service everywhere you go is because you're a bad customer. Lastly, to Nancy L. who said that the hostess greeted her without a smile. Get over yourself. not everything revolves around you. Let's change the way we treat the service industry. Lastly, I'd like to thank Kenny for providing us with great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=560
Brit S.,"Westminster, CA",110,39,3,5.0,6/3/2012,I just absolutely love this place. I think it's easily my favorite restaurant. I came here for lunch with my husband and was seated immediately. Our waitress was nice and quickly took our orders. Their strawberry lemonade is always delicious and I love the sugar they put around the rim and the glasses are so big! For an appetizer I ordered the vietnamese tacos which are to die for!!!! And the hubby got some sort of corn cakes or something that were also really good. For lunch I ordered the same thing I get every time I come here! The Luau Salad!!! This is by far my favorite salad of all time and definitely worth the ten bucks!!! We didn't get any cheesecake because I was already so full I almost felt a little nauseous! Can't wait to come back!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=560
Adriene W.,"San Pedro, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/24/2016,This is the worse location. I love the Cheesecake Factory. I've experienced excellent customer service but not at the HB location. The Waitress and the female manager was rude. We waited 25 minutes for cold hard bread after I asked her to bring fresh hot bread. She bought us cold spinach dip. Then the manager came to the table and asked us did we want her to microwave the dip. The manager asked us have we tried The Yard House Spinach Dip before. I was amazed!!! The final upsetting comment was when I showed the manager the old piled lettuce in the Chinese Chicken Salad. She agreed that it looked old.  At that point I was done.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=560
Bud G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,102,,2.0,10/12/2014,"For me: 2 STARS For my eating companions (in their opinion, of course): 3-4 STARS Let me preface this specific review that I've NEVER had a Cheesecake Factory experience that made me want to go back. To me it's the ultimate in big, mediocre corporate food and my meals have always disappointed me in one way or another.  It may be my curse, because  it seems that other people I'm with (usually) have better experiences (and I understand why), but I seem to always come out going ""meh."" Maybe I just keep ordering the wrong thing, even though it's a different wrong thing each time. So, why do I keep going back?  Honestly, the only reason I show up to CF is because I have to: I'm with a group of friends and/or relatives and/or business acquaintances who want to eat there and I'm not in a position to argue the point. When it's someone's birthday and that's where they want to eat, you go with the flow, no matter how painful.  I'm giving it 2 STARS on today's visit for these reasons: The waiter, while friendly, was sparse in his attention. We had to flag down other waiters to get stuff or wait for a while to see him to flag him down.  The bread was OK, though I'm not a fan of the dark/squaw (or whatever it is) bread, and the sourdough was a bit on the tough side.  My dish was the White chicken chili.  Almost 14 bucks. The menu actually starts out with the description of this dish saying ""A generous bowl of..."" The waiter asks me if I want white rice or brown with that. I say brown, but it matters not, because the rice ended up being what amounted to a tablespoon in about a cup's worth of chili that barely took up the bottom third of this huge bowl that it was brought in. So, yeah, as the menu said, the bowl was indeed generous. However, the contents were not. Really, 14 bucks for this? The rest of my party either laughed or felt sorry for me when they saw that my dish was actually much smaller than the kid's meal that one of the kids in our party had. My partner actually called the waiter over and asked him if this was a mistake. He said no, that's the serving size and walked away.  OK, well, I'll just eat bread to fill up, I guess... As far as the chili itself, it was very, well, OK. Mediocre. Kind of watery, about a tablespoon of rice, a few pieces of chicken, a few beans and nothing about the flavor to distinguish it from, say, a mediocre chicken tortilla soup from a diner.  Anyway, the cheesecakes were OK, but cheesecake doesn't blow me away, so once again, another weak experience.  However, I know, deep in my heart, that one day I'm going to have to come back here again, like it or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=560
UsTheKidAndTheDog F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,37,,1.0,12/29/2015,"Our experience tonight was terrible. What's funny is a woman left a comment yesterday about her food being cold. Clearly, no effort was made to correct the issue.  We dined here tonight and my potatoes tasted like they came out of the cooler. Additionally, we ordered the calamari appetizer which was undercooked. My husbands draft beer came to the table after the undercooked calamari. The manager did bring out a new calamari, but not until we were almost finished with our main course. During college, I worked in a very busy restaurant. I understand places get busy and staff become overwhelmed. The quality of the food should never be compromised.  I would avoid this location.

Same massive menus with equally massive portion sizes, same good-but-not-great service, almost always busy, etc etc. I like this CF location because it's right off the 405 and there's a decent amount of parking in the plaza, despite the many other restaurants and stores nearby. Came with the in-laws on this particular visit for my husband's bday and we had... *Lots of brown (wheat) bread - thanks to the waitress for actually bringing us only brown bread as requested (seriously, brown bread is way better than the white bread) *Avocado eggrolls - I'm hooked *Kale salad (from the ""small bites"" menu) - decent. Forgot to ask for the dressing on the side, and it felt like the pieces of kale hadn't been cut up as usual *Fresh artichoke - my sister-in-law ordered it and I had actually never had artichoke like this... surprisingly tasty, though a little more hands-on than I like my food *Chicken bellagio - my husband's favorite  *Filet mignon - FIL thought it was really good *Veggie burger - sis-in-law is also a vegetarian (pesc?) and didn't like this *Strawberry shortcake - ate too much of the biscuit and ice cream... but it's seriously my favorite dessert. Desserts are the #1 reason why I fail (repeatedly) as a vegan *Tiramisu cheesecake - my husband loves tiramisu... and cheesecake. So this is pretty much as good as it gets for him!

Lin D.,"Westminster, CA",43,33,1,4.0,3/23/2015,"Have a big occasion to celebrate? Eating carefully for your health or on a diet? Want to impress someone special? You can do all of the above at Cheesecake Factory. Portions on the regular menu are ample, particularly the yummy salads. I always have at least a third of my meal to take in a doggie bag. The tastes border on gourmet; every dish, of the 15 or so I've had, is elegantly presented and gives your taste buds an adventure. Watching your calories? There's a special menu with exact counts, some under about 500 calories, some under 600-650; all of these, 20 or more choices, have the same chef's flavors with lighter ingredients and smaller portions. The only drawback is really a testimonial to the restaurant's great quality: you may have to wait 1/2 hour or more to be seated at mealtimes, particularly weekends. Just call ahead. It can also be a little noisy, so tell the server if you need privacy. 116 check ins here and this is what come up with as a review of the day.

Our waiter was nice but towards the end had an attitude because my friend asked for a spaghetti WITH meat sauce. She had to order two extra dishes of meat sauce because there was not enough. Also, my chicken fettechini noodles were under cooked the first time. The manager came by and asked if I wanted a soup or salad. Besides that I got a new one and still the same problem.

We decided to try Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night even though it appeared we would have a long wait for a table. Not the case, We were very surprised to hear the call within just a few minutes.  We shared a huge salad that was really great, then I had a Mushroom/Swiss Cheese Burger and my lady had a pasta/chicken dinner- both were really excellent. We had told our server that we were celebrating our birthdays and she took good care of us.(sort of) At the end of our meal, our server asked us if we had room for a desert- we both sort of wondered if she had forgotten that we were doing the birthday thing- anyway, since we were in a desert style restaurant, we ordered the Blackout Cake to share- @ $7.95. It was really huge and very decadent-then moments after we got yhe cake-she brought is two little birthday sundaes with candles. So, what's the deal?

Nicole B.,"Long Beach, CA",346,64,415,5.0,9/2/2013,"I am solely basing my review on one particular dish...I don't care about the service and the ambiance and how long the wait was. All I care about is the Mac N' Cheese Burger.. A burger consisting of fried cheese balls, cheddar cheese sauce, and medium rare beef patty all sandwiched between two fluffy slices of bread. I always ask for a side of bbq sauce, garlic aioli, and ranch with the burger. Now it usually comes with extra items like tomatoes and onions etc. but I am a purist and ask for none of that nonsense! Once you place your hand on the bun and press down, the fried cheese balls burst and even start gushing over the side of your burger. It is extremely beautiful! Since I am on a diet I try to go for a ""lighter"" side by adding sweet potato fries instead of the regular kind. On my cheat days for the past couple of months I have been trying to stay away from Cheesecake (Due to its insane amount of calories) and trying different places instead, but honestly everything is gross in comparison to the Cheesecake version.

Last night my girlfriend and I just happen to get lucky and swoop a table in the bar otherwise the wait was about an hour for 2.  My favorite thing about this place is their Strawberry Martini They are so delicious but you pay up the you know what for them.  $11.25. I just think that's a lot for a chain and its not like we are even in LA .  The food is blahhh but the menu is huge so its a good place to come and know that everyone will find something they like. Last night I ordered a Caesar Salad, no croutons with grilled shrimp. My salad came and had no croutons or cheese. Haha. No big deal.  The server brought the cheese and I was good to go.  I also ordered a side salad and he brought me the large one.  Again not a big deal. Except for the fact that he charged me $11 for the salad and an additional $7 for the shrimp. And again no big deal. Just seemed like a lot for the Cheesecake Factory. The service has always been friendly and last night was no exception. Although our server complained to us that they had an early staff meeting at 8am and that he was fried.  Ummmm, Okay?  Then he kept saying ""Ohhhhh. I forgot to bring your alcohol"" (in reference to my martini.  Way to make a girl feel like a lush.  Hahaha. All in all, the Cheesecake Factory is perfectly passable.

I regularly........ well, maybe once a month or so, stop at this CF location on my way back from Los Angeles on business, or will take a Huntington Beach or Fountain Valley client here for lunch.  Today I shared lunch with a client, and from some primal place deep in my ""Alma"" (that's ""soul"" in both Spanish and Portuguese) had this driving desire for a really focused, basic, cheeseburger! Why am I giving 4-stars to CFHB (Cheesecake Factory Huntington Beach) today? Because I ordered the ""Classic-Original Burger"", and added what I believe make any great burger greater... carmelized onions, fresh avocado slices, and bacon....... in addition to the melted chedder, it came with tomato and lettuce on the side. I added the tomato back in, but didn't add in the lettuce.  The burger meat by itself was at least 1/3 pound, maybe a little more. I ordered my burger medium rare, and it was! PLUS...... CFHB must grill on an open flame grate, because the outside was chared with a wonderful crusty, smoke-char flavor, and the meat tasted like great burger meat. (cheap burgers sometimes don't have any flavor at all).  I'm going to try this again at our local Mission Viejo location. My bet is, if all CF locations follow the same prep and use the same grill, the burger will again rank up there with one of the best I've ever had; mid 80's...... Hamburger Hamlet, Pasadena. Damn..... now THAT was one char-grilled delicious burger, and that's my gold standard for taste. I'm saying that today's sandwich was a clean 7 out of 10, given that 10 = my Pasadena experience.

He came and asked if we needed something.  He took care of our requests, he was pleasant, welcoming and could have taught our server a thing or two about customer service.  This isn't our first visit to your location.  Let's just say that we come there for the product (cheescake), definitely not the service.  Overall, we need to get back to true customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=820

Unfortunately they didn't have my favorite cheesecake on hand since they were sold out, but at least they had complimentary smiles (didn't Washington Mutual offer that as well). The temporary service was offered with the quickness. Then again, my mind can't help but fathom and think they aren't legal enough to even take out on a date.

When ordering wine, he offered multiple types of Chardonnay - impressive! When I asked if they had a dairy-free and egg-free, he said no but proposed a bowl of fresh strawberries minus the whipped cream - sooooo not expecting such a recommendation for such an atypical question, but WOW is that great customer service!

Tracie L.,"Orange County, CA",1055,634,3147,5.0,7/27/2012,"This cheesecake factory is close by and I prefer it over the Newport beach or Irvine Spectrum one because there's rarely ever a wait! Service is fast and everytime I come here, I never had a bad waiter/waitress. They're all very friendly and helpful at suggesting different dishes. I wasn't going to write a review til, but after coming yesterday 7/25/12, I had to make sure I finished a review for it. I had a great experience yesterday. My bf & I came w/ his little nephew and waited no longer than 3 mins for a table. Our waitress (Tricia) was a total doll! She got us 2 of the fresh warm right out of the oven wheat bread (their addicting brown bread everyone talks about) as requested since we don't like the sourdough one. The food took a while to arrive, but they were pretty busy that night. So here's where Tricia saved them from being a 4 star: After looking at their nutritional guide menu (LOVE THAT THEY GIVE YOU THIS!!) and skinnylicious menu I decided to get the Island grilled chicken w/ NO SALT and sauce on the side. She got the order right, but the chef over grilled the chicken AND pineapple, it was pretty damn black and gross. I didn't wanna be a lil complaining customer or anything cause my bf & nephew already started eating their food and I was starving so i just ended up trynna cut off the burnt part which was more than half the chicken.. Tricia saw this and said she was more than happy and wanted to bring the plate back and ask them for a new one! She even offered me a dish on the house so that I wouldn't be starving while waiting :) The new plate came out and was BOMB dot com!! grilled perfectly and everything was great. +1 for her customer service My bf had the kobe burger med. rare and it was sooo good. Juicy patty and the mushrooms all mixed well together. We were able to save room for dessert and got their low carb cheesecake w/ strawberries. I know what you're thinking..it's cheesecake factory we're probably over the 2000 calorie limit anyway so why not just get the real shit right? LOL well just for my carb conscious self I thought i'd give it a try to see how it tasted compared to their regular cheesecake. Well..IT TASTED JUST AS GOOD AS THE REGULAR ONE!! I wish they made more low carb cheesecakes especially their oreo one haha.

He made sure we were taken care of and was attentive to our table.  Only reason why I gave a 4 star instated of 5 is because our main entrees were not great.  I ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair and the pasta was poorly cooked, pasta came in chunks stuck together and the shrimp was over cooked and overall dry. My husband ordered a chicken sandwich and it tasted like it was deep fried in old oil that had been used for a while. Maybe they just had an off day but James immediately took care of us.  We ordered another entree and the Ahi salad I ordered and the Cuban sandwich my husband ordered was great!! We will be going back and definitely asking to be seated in James' section.

Vi V.,"Orange County, CA",281,760,3358,3.0,3/24/2014,"Located in the Bella Terra area next to the Barnes and Nobles. Parking is always horrible here, but there's a parking garage if you don't mind the walk. Walked in and the place is pretty dimly lit so it gave off a romantic feel without having to be all dressed up. Cheesecakes are on the left when you walk in if you want to look at it. What we got: Bread & Butter: they bring it out to you after you order. It comes with a brown wheat bread (but sweeter) and a sourdough bread. They bring out butter squares too. The butter is cold so it was hard to spread.  Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll ($13): it was a deep fried sushi roll with tuna inside. It had green onion shreds on top of it and a soy sauce dipping sauce. Not something I would get again. The tuna was all mushy inside, green onion shreds were more like presentation than something edible. Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta ($17): our server said this was his favorite dish and I can see why. Comes with chicken, asparagus, peas, and tortilla strips on top of penne pasta with a spicy chipotle sauce. I thought it was really good and they give you a lot so I was able to have it for lunch the next day. Big chunks of chicken, but they didn't have much flavor. The veggies inside the pasta were soft and actually tasted pretty good. I loved the spicy chipotle sauce though, not too spicy, but does have a nice kick. I just wish the pasta was cooked a little longer because it was too al dente for me. Steak Diane ($20): cuts of angus beef steak covered with mushrooms and grilled onions and a side of mashed potatoes. Steak was cooked perfectly and it was soft and juicy, but my favorite thing would probably have to be the mushrooms. I don't know what they did to it but it was so good! It was soft and had so much flavor to it. Mashed potatoes were creamy, but nothing made it stand out from any other mashed potatoes. Service: Our server that night was Kyle. Friendly guy and would make conversations with us. He was quick to refill our water glasses and getting us anything else we needed.

Our party of two didn't have to wait long fortunately.  Also, our waiters were quick and attentive. We each ordered a burger, which comes with your choice of fries or garden salad.  It's still Lent, so I stuck with their portabella on a bun.   Although I enjoyed the burger initially, they blacken the ginormous portabella mushroom so the meld of flavors becomes tiresome 3/4 of the way through.  On the other hand, the kobe beef burger may very well become your new favorite!

The food was delicious though and well worth the wait.  My small salad ($3.95) was actually a good sized ""regular"" serving of salad with 2 freshly cut half slices of tomatoes tossed in their very own vinaigrette.  The lettuce wraps were also giant portion sized and could have fed 3 people so its a good thing we shared this plate.  I love it because they put 3 different sauces (peanut sauce, a thai sauce and some other one I didn't really take a liking to), some noodles, shredded carrots, pickled cucumbers, and grilled chicken teriyaki.  All for you to mix and pick which toppings would like to go inside your wrap.  The lettuce they used for the wraps were big itself and all the condiments and meat fit perfectly inside.  We devoured that thing, it was so good.   Len's jambalaya is on a league of its own.   The shrimp was so juicy and flavorful that I wished I'd gotten his order.  It's my next one to order when I go here again.  Our server, Mike was pretty good about frequenting our table and checking in on us.   It was a shame I didn't get my beloved Tiramisu..almost a sin!  I should get two next time to make up for this.  Try it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=640
Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2377,8717,4.0,1/17/2012,"I used to come to this particular location often, like maybe every few months, because it is located in the Bella Terra Plaza. This plaza is a great place to go for a nice date night because you can walk around and check out all of the shops, check out a movie and have your pick of restaurants to dine at afterwards.  Well there is more than enough parking here if you choose to eat at The Cheesecake Factory (right next to Barnes and Noble Bookstore). The restaurant is nice and clean, cheesecake slices are deliciously displayed in the bakery case and restrooms are usually clean and adequately stocked. There is plenty of yummy and tasty foods you can choose from to order, salads, sandwiches, soups, pasta dishes, chicken and mashed potatoes, beef and rice, an array of appetizers and starters, etc. One of my most favorite appetizers to order is the Thai lettuce wraps. This a huge platter of food that can feed 4 or more people. You could also make this a full meal for 2 or 3 people. I love the sauces that come with this dish. The chicken is perfectly seasoned, very moist and tender. This is definitely a fun food to order (but can be messy, so maybe not the best dish to order on a first date).  Portions of whatever you order are generally pretty generous so you will leave satisfied and full. And if you are like me, you will probably fill up on the free bread in the beginning of the meal while you wait for your meal. I love that Cheesecake has a skinnylicious menu (but don't be fooled, these items are still pretty high in calories, so don't think these dishes are calorie free) and also a small plates menu (perfect for a nice late night bite). Now on to the cheesecakes! If you love desserts, then you MUST try one of their delectable flavors. I hope to someday try all of the flavors. I especially love the pumpkin cheesecake when it's in season (I like to call ahead of time to see if it's in). There are also noncheesecake desserts, but I have never tried them. I really want to try them, but I always get side tracked by the long list of cheesecakes.  The pricing here is a bit pricey, but I am willing to pay it because the food is so delicious. The service here has been pretty good, but sometimes on occassion, I have found some not so attentive servers. But it wasn't so bad that I wouldn't continue to come back here.  Oh and there is also the Sunday brunch menu you can try. The brunch menu is just okay, I find the omelettes and the hash to be a bit greasy and oily. The waffles are huge and the french toast is really thick and sweet. It's like eating dessert.  And by the way, if you come here for late night eating, just know that the lighting is dimmed. A bit too dark for me though. I prefer to be able to see what I am eating and be able to see my date better. But of course it's dimmed for the atmosphere. I just wished it was a little bit brighter.  Overall, food is excellent, service is usually pretty good and pricing is acceptable. A nice place for a date and has one of the best cheesecakes that's perfect for sharing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=640

Made great suggestions on the drink I had.. Strawberry martini... Best drink ever! And the peppermint cheesecake. I was stuffed from the meal but I was so glad I tried the dessert anyways. It was great. My bf had the steak diane and salmon combo. It was delicious. The steak and salmin were separates by mountain of mash potato both with different sauces but goes together very well. The bread was good. I had a reg house salad and I enjoyed that also. We had avocado egg rolls. It was ok.. I think a vegetarian might appreciate it more then I did but it wasnt bad. It just felt like it was missing something cuz the whole eggroll was avocado....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=640

Courtney H.,"Westminster, CA",164,133,100,2.0,1/10/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory! I've been to this location many times being that I don't live far from it. Today I was meeting a friend for lunch I arrived before she did. As everyone knows this place can get pretty crowded so I went to the hostess and put my name on the list for party of two. I was told it would be only a few minutes which was fine. As names started to be called we were still waiting. We noticed people coming through the door and were being seated within minutes. I walk up to the podium and tell the girl I've been waiting for 20 minutes and have yet to be seated. She proceeds to tell me someone else must've have got seated when they heard my name. I thought to myself what a lame excuse my name is Courtney, I'm pretty sure I would've heard my own name! Anyway she puts my name in the system about a minute later we were seated at a table where the waiter had yet to pick up the check. Our waiter was Scott he was very nice and attentive. I had the shrimp angel hair pasta which was great as always. Food was great, Scott was great however I have to give this place two stars because of the fact that at least 5 other parties who arrived after me were seated before I was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=640
Karen B.,"Newport Beach, CA",530,550,62,5.0,2/3/2013,"I know 5 stars seems a bit high but everything last night was absolutely seamless. Was heading home from LA and decided to grab a bite here. People were already waiting outside and we expected at least a 30 minute wait. We were told 10-15 minutes and I thought that was doubtful but shocked after 10 minutes were seated. Sat outside on the patio and it was nice and warm and the gazebo added such a nice feel to the atmosphere. Our server came immediately, her name was Rachel and she had the sweetest disposition and great smile. Drinks and warm hot bread were served right away. The menu had some great selections and they had a separate menu called Skinnylicious, items were 590 calories or less. I liked that they serve breakfast all day too because sometimes I love breakfast for dinner. We ordered steak and a chicken sandwich, both served with fries(very good) and the steak had onion rings as well. Everything was delicious. Our server kept the water filled and checked on us, still with that great smile. After dinner we ordered cheesecake to go, always so decadent! I was so impressed on a Saturday night that everything went so perfectly. Even the valet parked the car close because we had a bunch of things inside that we were concerned about. $5.00 for valet was cheap and well worth peace of mind. I had to make a point of letting the manager know our server was awesome and the experience was exceptional. Oftentimes chains do not seemed to be as concerned because they have established themselves but this location and service was a stand out, therefore 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=640

We continued to wait. Then 2 next groups of 3 got called to be seated. Still no sign of calling us. So my boyfriend asked again. Now the boy told us that he forgot where he left our ticket at. This is just totally ridiculous, something that i didnt expect from an American restaurant. We just left. Total waste of time. This is also the 1st time coming here. Since we want to give it a try.

The big thing about it that made me give it a 3 is the wait time on 2 of the 4 plates.  We received 2 of the plates, both pasta, and then took 7-10 minuets for the other 2, which one was a burger and the other was a salad.  There is no reason for that, no one came out to apologize or to tell us it would be a bit for it or anything.  The server didn't even come out to check on us during this time.  I work at a restaurant, and this is not acceptable.  I was going to talk to the manager, but just wanted to finish and get out.

Cuban sandwhich (in a freaking pasta place) - My dad ordered this for some insane reason and never even ate it so I have no clue how it tastes. It did have cheese melted and what looked liked slices of real beef and not deli meats.  Red Velvet Cheesecake - It's good BUT share it. It gets too sweet after a few bites.  30th Anniversary choco cake - Dad's a chocoholic, 'nuff said. It's pretty good I like how it had bits of choco crumbs ( or something of the like) which added necessary texture. Sweet, very very sweet.  Brothers had sliders and chicken strips from the kids menu.

They bring us food, and one of the dishes is completely wrong.  So the manager comes and says that he will get her's out in 8 minutes and as she waits she could have a free salad (and the entree would be complemented also), so I think O.K.  They are starting to make up for it. 4.  The salad comes out 10 minutes later.  Then the entree comes out about 25 minutes later, after all of us are finished with the meal.   5. We order two desserts, one comes out cold (""hot"" apple crisp) and the other (a cake) is messed up by the same server letting her tie go across the the cake.   6.  Then we get the bill, nothing is taken off, not even the food the manager said he was going to comp.    7.  Ten minutes later, when I am finally able to track down the manager, he comped the things that got messed up.   Overall worst experience I have ever had at any Cheesecake.  I personally will most likely not be going back to this location.  Even Cheesecake Factory in general, to me, has suffered a loss in image because of this.  Left the table not feeling like we as a group had a good time at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=620

We were seated almost immediately despite our group of 7 and drinks and orders were taken within the first 10 minutes of being seated.  Everyone's food arrived about 15 minutes later, all but the BIRTHDAY GIRL'S dinner! The manager stopped by our table to inform us that her meal had been overcooked (*they overcooked her chicken in her Louisiana pasta dish) so they offered her a free cheesecake to go in return for her food being delayed. Her food didn't show up till the rest of us had finished our meals! ( we tried waiting for her food but it was more than a 30 min wait!) but when her food did arrive, the service after that was great. They continued to refill drinks and sang her a birthday song along with her free cheesecake they had promised her and a free birthday ice cream cup (which was mostly whip cream..but she loves whip cream so :) ) I would've given this place 4 stars if they had just hadn't made my birthday pal wait so long for her meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=660

But being the passive aggressive diner that I am...I just had to write a bad review. The Cheesecake Factory is insanely popular due to its large menu. That I get...it's actually pretty decent in portion and taste. But the prices...wow!!   The thing that sucks about this particular location the most is the service!

We arrived on a Saturday at Noon and expected a full restaurant, but were pleasantly surprised. It was busy, but not crowded. We had a reservation for 16 and they accommodated seating us right away, even tho' only half our party was there. We wanted to get started with ordering drinks and our server ""Laura J"" came to the table right away to get us taken care of. She was BEYOND AWESOME! We're talking ROCK STAR Server here people! We have a very particular group and she rolled with all of the requests and took care of everything without a problem. She even allowed us to get separate checks!!! This is unheard of in a group our size! The drinks and food were also awesome (My orange chicken was prepared perfectly). In fact, the only bummer about this location, is the parking situation. The restaurant is part of the Bella Terra Mall and people can be pretty jerk-like in the parking lot. There are limited spaces near the restaurant, so be prepared to walk - or splurge for the $5 valet parking (which I'll do next time).

From a rate of 1 to 10 in spiciness i say it must be a 1 lmao what a joke. They mention that its their most popular pasta dish. I don't know how they came to that conclusion because yes it taste like very fresh ingredients however where is that Southern Cajun Taste. I know how Jambalaya taste like this tasted no where near it and was really bland.

The service has always been very polite, the food has always been good and I have never had to wait a very long time to be seated. I love that there is a wide variety menu also. Basically, something for everyone. They also have some unusual milkshake alcoholic beverages that are really yummy as long as your not dieting, my god, because they are pretty rich. I've tried the Chocolate Monkey which was very good, almost a dessert in itself. I've also tried a peanut butter and chocolate concoction there also, very rich but very tasty if you like that sort of thing, which I do. Also the ambiance here is very nice. The Cheesecake Factory has a nice but casual feel to it. I also like the decor of this place. I like how at night the restaurant kind of dims its lights. Like I said, casual but nice. They have a great chicken salad sandwich with almond slivers in it to die for! I've also ordered their cheesecakes for birthdays also, which have always been awesome! I love how this restaurant has so much variety in their menu choices and in their cheesecake flavors. Makes for a unique dining experience that not just any restaurant can offer. I am definitely a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. The Cheesecake Factory in Brea and in Anaheim are also very good. This restaurant chain is highly recommended by me. I personally have always had great service here. I also would recommend this place in the case of gift certificates because you really can't go wrong.

I'm sure a ton of people order something random just for their bread basket.  I mean...why else do people go to Cheesecake Factory? Ha, on a more serious note, they have a pretty good happy hour here.  I believe it's from 4-6:30 and everything is pretty darn cheap.  I would say, it ranges from $4-$6 and the good is a pretty decent portion.  They also have a small plates menu which is no way small.  Because let's be honest, Cheesecake Factory portions are known to be for people with endless stomachs.  The boy and I split the ahi carpaccio, roadside sliders, mac&cheese balls, and greek salad.  All were delicious.  I think there were 4 sliders and 4 mac&cheese balls which were pretty big portions considering how much they cost.  The mac&cheese balls were so disgustingly good.  It's that feeling where you want to eat the entire thing, but you know how bad it is for you.  Between the happy hour menu and the small plates menu, you have more than enough choices. I will definitely be back to try their other things on the menu.  It was a great way to try different things without being stuck with one ginormous platter of food that you will barely eat since you stuffed yourself with so much bread.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=660

Ken M.,"Gardena, CA",4,12,,4.0,2/19/2014,"Located right off the 405 and inside the Bella Tella outdoor shopping center, this one is pretty clean and modern and they've got an outdoor patio that can handle a table for two, as well as larger parties.  Parking can be tight on weekends in the nearby lot near Barnes & Noble, so if it's crowded, I'd suggest parking in the structure on the other side towards Costco.   If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory, anticipate your entrée being a pretty good sized portion.  One of my favorite appetizers here has got to be the fried mac n' cheese, which is certainly not an everyday food, but heck, once in a while, you deserve it.  Their sweet tamale corn cakes are another winner, especially if you're not in the mood for meat.  Garlic noodles aren't too shabby, either.  Sandiwiches are also pretty solid and seriously, their menu has so many different types of food, there's bound to be something for everyone.   Of course, you probably want to save some room for cheesecake, though they're usually in the $7-9 range per slice, so they're not as reasonably priced as their entrees.  If you're looking for something not too sweet, opt for the vanilla cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=540

It is so delicious it keeps you wanting more. My sister order this other pasta plate which was also delicious but i forgot what its called, she actually got it thanks to the waitress (im sorry i forgot your name but if you read this review thank u so much for recommending this plate to my sister). She was also very helpful and nice. My cousin got the Louisiana pasta as well. She loved it! And my friend got the steak Diane with mashed potatoes and shrimp scampi, which was also delicious.  We then moved onto desserts, i got the tiramisu cheesecake, my sister and cousin got the fresh strawberry cheesecake, and my friend got the chocolate chip cheesecake.

Claire G.,"Long Beach, CA",252,89,79,5.0,8/11/2013,"My family and I ordered the following when we visited The Cheesecake Factory: Fresh Kale Salad, Stuffed Mushrooms, Crispy Crab Bites, Thai Lettuce Wraps, Steak Diane, Chargrilled Coulotte Steak, Banana Cheesecake and Original Cheesecake. The Fresh Kale Salad was served with cranberries, apples, marcona almonds and green beans tossed with a Buttermilk-Black Pepper Dressing. Although this menu item is listed under the small plates and snacks, the serving size was enough for my husband and I to share. We asked for the dressing on the side, so that we could control how much dressing to put because we don't like our salads drenched in dressing. We will definitely order this salad again because it is healthy, fresh, and delicious! The Stuffed Mushrooms were also listed under the small plates and snacks menu item, so we got 6 bite sized stuffed mushrooms that I shared with my husband. The mushrooms are stuffed with fontina and parmesan cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce. We will definitely order this menu item again because it was very yummy! The Crispy Crab Bites are featured in the small plates and snacks menu as well as in the SkinnyLicious Menu. These bite-sized little crab cakes are served with mustard sauce. This item tasted okay. There was nothing special about the flavors, so I will most likely not order this menu item again. The Thai Lettuce Wraps are featured under the Appetizers menu. When you receive this item, you will be amazed by the display of food and colors!  All of the ingredients are laid out on a boat shaped dish, so that you can create your own lettuce tacos!  Ingredients: Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. The mixture of all of these ingredients will burst into your mouth!  This dish is a bit messy, but definitely fun, colorful, and flavorful!  I will definitely order this menu item in future visits! Steak Diane: I asked the server about the most ordered menu item and he recommended the Steak Diane. This certified angus beef steak is adequately covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce (with few pieces of mushrooms) and served with perfectly mashed potatoes and grilled onions. This meal was by far, my most favorite menu item!  The portion sizes are large, so I was only able to eat half of what was provided.  This meal tasted even better for lunch the next day! My husband and daughter ordered the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak (Prime Sirloin). Although this steak is served with French Fries and Crispy Onion Rings, both my husband and daughter substituted this part with steamed broccoli.  From what I heard, they both enjoyed the steak and broccoli very much.  The steak was nice and tender and the sauce from the steak was delicious! Dessert: I shared a Banana Cheesecake with my husband and our daughter ordered the Original Cheesecake. The cheesecake tasted like bananas and the sliced bananas that covered the cheesecake were fresh. This cheesecake wasn't rich and sweet, which is exactly what I like! I will definitely order the banana cheesecake the next time I visit The Cheesecake Factory! Don't forget to try the fresh, warm, and delicious rye bread that is provided as soon as you sit down at your table.  Slather some of their sweet butter on that rye bread to get a taste of it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=540

Cor V.,"Westminster, CA",0,383,294,3.0,1/8/2016,"Cheesecake Factory today after watching the Hateful 8 movie could not lift my spirits up....was it the movie or the omelette or the service??  Let's just say that the service could have been a bit better and the omelette was meh.....I really expected more from a simple spinach mushroom omelette...it came with dry slices of toast and I opted for their cubed potatoes.  Is it just me, or has the way you make omelettes changed....I expected the ingredients which also included cheese and bacon bits to be totally immersed and mixed within the omelette...helas it appeared that part was cooked separate and then FOLDED in separately cooked egg....oh well.  The toast came dry...no butter, no jellies.....and the potato squares got over cooked under the heat lamp....I can't blame the staff too much as one person waited on many many tables.....perhaps the movie had an influence on me.....you have to experience it yourself....and I should give the extensive menu at the Cheesecake Factory another chance....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=540

I like to get a simple grilled piece of salmon here--nothing too exciting, but it's my go-to because I always find it moist and not overly-seasoned. Entrees aside, I personally think the best part of coming here is the cheesecake selection. My favorites are vanilla bean, dulce de leche, and banana because of their relative lightness.

lisa n.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",121,55,97,3.0,2/12/2008,"so...what to say about the cheesecake factory here...lets start off with the good... the few times i've been here the service hasn't been too bad, though i try and avoid the main dinner times so that could be it. hehe. The servers have always been pleasant, and able to crack jokes back to me and my friends who have gone in.  Food is pretty good. I play it safe and get pasta most of the time, Evelyn's Favorite being my favorite as well. yummy spring-ish pasta =)  Pretty much you've gotta figure that it's your standard fare of pastas, pizzas burgers at prices a little bit more expensive than they are sometimes worth, but *shrug* what are you going to do.  If nothing else, stay for the main attraction, which since it's cheesecake factory, umm definately the cheesecake!!! yum!!!! faves have to be the key lime cheesecake, Dulce de leche, vanillla bean, and craig's crazy carrot. I'd love to reccomend some of the chocolate ones, however since i'm allergic...not so much =p But some of the ones that my friends like are the chocolate coconut and the godiva chocolate cheesecake. and now the not so good... since it's bella terra be prepared to possibly walk a decent distance to get wherever you're going Sometimes even the parking structure is packed.   Also, service can really be a hit or miss, especially when it starts to get busier and then your server tends to disappear.  okay. well go in and enjoy kiddies! =) hehehe",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=920
Michelle N.,"Irvine, CA",42,136,26,4.0,1/2/2008,"I am not a huge fan of American food (as you can see by my reviews), especially chains, but this one is okay in my book! I have eaten here a few times now and I have to say that the food and service have been excellent. The place is massive and the wait will be a bit long weekend evenings, but the place is huge so you move through pretty quickly. The decor is a bit odd...a mix of Egyptian and art nouveau, but it is fun and the massive booths are comfy. My servers have always been quick and super nice, which is good when I bring along the fam. I have to say that I was surprised at how good their corn cakes (appetizers) and pizza were.  But what really got me was how tasty their fish and chips were. Almost brought a tear to my eye as I doused it with more malt vinegar...the fish was juicy and flaky, and the coating wasn't geasy and even stayed slightly crispy under my 2 cups of required vinegar required to eat it (because everyone knows that vinegar cancels out all that cholesterol, right?). I would happily go back and order it again, esp since it is cheaper than O'Malleys if you make it for the lunch special and it is a more manageable size.  Another thing I always get when I go here is their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Dear God, it is super rich, but it is super fluffy, dark chocolatey and good. What is nice is that the slice is so massive that it takes about 5 days to finish off a slice, so you get your money's worth. Ah, and I noticed parking is a huge issue with most reviews, and I can see why. If you actually attempt to park around this restaurant, be prepared to drive agressively because it is absolutely nuts around there. If you are not doing valet, then park over by Staples because it is always quiet in that area and you will need the walk after you finish eating there. So, check this place out if you are in the area and get there by 5 so you can take advantage of their lunch specials.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=920

I ordered the shepherd's pie and coffee and my friend ordered a salad and tomato basil pasta with chicken. I have to say that I am a coffee snob to the highest degree and their coffee was really good for not being freshly ground and french pressed coffee. My friend's salad was big, very fresh ingredients and the vinagrette was good too. Then the main dishes arrived.  Holy crap they were huge!! Both entrees easily could be divided into 3 portions each and you would still be full. The shepherds pie was delicious. A hearty, winey, brown gravy with lots of mushrooms and the potato topping was awesome! The pasta was also really good-very flavorful and loved the feta cheese in it! Both of us took home a huge amount of food, enough for at least 2 more servings. We were too full for cheesecake, so maybe next time I will just order dessert! I am deducting 1 star for parking.

Dianne L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",14,61,1,3.0,12/30/2010,"Normally, I wouldn't go to a Cheesecake Factory because I've been scarred from past experiences, but my cousin forced me to go this time. She somehow convinced me that this one is good and that I'd like it. However, she was only partly correct.    Since it was just the two of us, we were seated at a two person table, (obviously) but it was located right next to a cramped area, making movement limited. The table next to us was also extremely close to ours.    I ordered a Smokehouse Burger and it was a little over 10 dollars, so I guess that's a decent price for a restaurant burger..but the buns were soggy. As soon as I lifted it, the bottom bun just fell apart. My cousin ordered the Four Cheese Pasta and she enjoyed it, though. Our waitress was kind enough to bring us hot towels after our meal.    For dessert, we ordered a Chocolate Chip Cheesecake and it was delicious. Highlight of the meal, actually.  After we finished eating, it was hard to track down our waitress. She came a couple minutes later to drop off the check, but never came back to pick it up. We waited for about 15 minutes but nothing so we just decided to leave.

Bess B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",31,21,6,4.0,6/27/2011,"My husband and I enjoy Cheesecake Factory. They do a pretty good job at offering a consistent product so we always know what to expect.   We don't care for their cheesecake. Ya, I know that sounds odd, but it is so over the top sweet and rich. It's like eating butter, no thanks. What we love is  the fresh basket of warm sourdough and brown bread they place on the table. Delicious!!!!!  Now on to what we had there Saturday evening. I had one of my favorites, the Chinese Chicken Salad. It is a huge salad with lettuce, cabbage, slivered almonds, thinly sliced chicken, mandarin oranges, a delicious tangy dressing and a gigantic mound of crispy rice noodles on top. Since I am never able to finish this salad, I ask for the dressing on the side to preserve the crispness of the lettuce, so I can bring 1/2 home and have it the following day. While the salad was delicious as always, I have noticed that on the last few visits there is less and less chicken. My husband got the club sandwich which comes with french fries. This is a typical club with turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato.. All this goodness is placed between three pieces of sourdough bread. He loved it, and also took 1/2 home for the following day. The fries were amazing, I know 1st hand as I periodically helped myself throughout our meal.  The service was outstanding. We were greeted warmly when we sat at a high top in the bar. Our server was friendly and promptly took our drink order and returned with my chardonnay and my husband's cold beer. She was attentive during our meal, but did not make us feel rushed. Hint: This place is very busy, we always skip the wait to  dine in the dining room and head for the bar where we can help ourselves to a high top. We go just before regular lunch or dinner hours. Their happy hour is really great too. Summary: *Huge portions *Consistent product *Many high calorie/high fat items, be careful if you are trying to eat   healthy *Grab a high top in the bar rather than waiting in line for the dining room *Fairly consistent service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=860

Never been an uber fan of The Cheesecake Factory, although they do make some might fine cheesecake. (no surprise) Their food is typical--salads, pastas, pizzas, burgers, etc. None of which I've ever been disappointed with, but never been amazed. Tried this location after shopping @ DVD Planet (see next review) and was absolutely thrilled with the service! (thus the 4 stars) Even though it was the lunch rush we were promptly seated in a booth (love booths!) and greeted immediately by our server, Kimberly N. She was FANTASTIC! Super friendly--but not fake friendly or scary weird friendly--just seemed like she really enjoyed what she was doing. (maybe she's new?) Anyway, drinks came out quick, food came out quick & tasty and we were checked up on frequently. At one point they tried to give me another salad! Maybe they could smell the 'yelp' on me??

She offered to bring a person (presumably the manager) to improve our experience. To add addition insult, the person (believe to be the manager) refused to appear. In stead, a pie slice was delivered free of charge. I decided to write this on the receipt ""Even with the incentive of a $20 tip would perhaps change your perspective in how you profiled us, your service did not improve.

One side cesar salad never came out and we assumed this was just a mistake on the kitchens behalf but thought nothing of it. Then all of our entrees came out except the entree that was for the girl with the cesar salad. Since i work in the food industry i immediately thought that this seemed as though Kaitlyn forgot to put that girls entire order in. After 10 minutes she finally noticed and then ran to the kitchen.

It's usually pleasant, food is pretty good in general. Hosts are slightly aloof, but most servers are cordial and accommodating.  We've eaten at the HB one a couple times due to its close proximity.This location is lacking something though.  Maybe its due to the area - it's next to a bookstore, in a shopping plaza. I know other ones are in malls and such, but this feels almost strip mall-ish. The ambience that other spots have (Redondo Beach, Marina del Rey) is lacking here.  In addition every time we have eaten here they have messed up our orders. One request: no onions. And every time we get our food - onions. At least we got free cheesecake out of it. Hmm, maybe I'm on to something.... Anyway, some highlights on the menu. Avocado eggrolls are great, as is Miso Salmon and Bistro Shrimp pasta. Tuxedo cheesecake is a favorite of mine, but most ppl go for Dulce de Leche or White Chocolate Raspberry. Hard to go wrong with the dessert menu though, most of it is tasty.

Mindy H.,"Irvine, CA",419,324,291,2.0,6/26/2008,"UGH.  This cheesecake factory will forever tarnish the squeaky clean image of other cheesecake factories for me. It wasn't the service that was appalling. . .it was their food.  As always, their service is accommodating, swift, and professional.  However, it was seriously the food that was atrocious. For one, I ordered the iced green tea which was beyond pepperminty, I felt like I was inhaling pure peppermint essence.  And if ya'll know (I know the ladies know this) but peppermint is known to suppress the appetite. . .but boy did it do more than that.  I totally lost it. Those of you that know me. . .(and none of you don't) know that I eat A LOT.  I can totally out-eat my friend. . .and he has a healthy appetite.  I can literally eat ALL the bread they give you, plus my entree and maybe squeeze in some dessert. . .but after the gross iced tea, I sat there pouting, waiting for redemption to come. It never did. I ordered the miso salmon (lunch portion) on a bed of spinach instead of rice.  What I love about Cheesecake is that they love to accommodate you, and will substitute almost anything for you.  Instead, what I got was this watery mess. . .it was like they forgot to drain my spinach or something.  On top of THAT, my miso was more of a sauce than its usual paste.  It's like they just took a hose and watered down my meal. . .it was tasteless and SOGGY and totally gross.  Needless to say, after two bites, I was done with it.  It totally ruined my appetite for the ENTIRE day (okay fine, so I was attacking my bf's pantry a few hours later.. .but STILL, I would've polished that baby off!!!) I was so disappointed, even shopping couldn't cheer me up. . .and spending money ALWAYS cheers me up =( (BTW my friend got the ranch house burger and LOVED it.  In addition to pieces of steak, it comes with a giant meat patty, bacon, onions, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and fries.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=880
Ann B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",15,31,1,3.0,11/26/2007,"After last night's dinner, I absolutely felt compelled to write a review...in large part, due to the poor service by waitress, V. I was there to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our party consisted of nine people, so the 18% gratuity tip is a given but she certainly did not deserve it. -we requested for more of that sweetened honey bread, but she did not bring it to us. never once did she look over to our table. we had to wait until we received our main courses to put in another request to another server. -some of our water mugs were completely empty. she was refilling customers at other tables. if it weren't for one of us grabbing her attention, she would've walked the other way without giving us refills. -additionally, we had to request for a dessert menu. what is the cheesecake factory if they don't offer you cheesecake? -lastly, when she separated our checks, one of my friends bill showed  more than a 90% tip. Granted, mistakes happen, but this just shows how she overlooked us and provided incredibly poor service. Her positives... -she did gather a group of coworkers to present the birthday sundae and sing to my friend -she was right with her recommendation to my friend who questioned which dish would be more filling for him. Food-wise...I was pleased. My friend and I shared the ""Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic."" We are girls, and the amount was just right for the two of us. It is my new favorite dish at this restaurant. You can't go wrong with ""Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Carmelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce. "" We also tried the ""Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake"" for the first time. It is lighter cheesecake, but it tasted very much like a lemon-flavored starburst.  In the past... -Louisiana Chicken Pasta (The chicken is the best part. It has a nicely breaded, crispy crust. The pasta, on the other hand, was lacking in the flavor department.) -Crispy Spicy Beef (The breaded, crispy beef is very good as well. The only thing is that it is not good as leftovers. I really like that this dish comes with vegetables; however, it can be overpowered because it is completely dowsed with the teriyaki-like sauce. I have had hit and misses with the rice; one time it was very dry and not completely cooked.) -Fried Macaroni and Cheese (ball of breaded mac and cheese that is very rich and creamy. It is served with marinara sauce. It is only good immediately after being served. Otherwise, it starts getting cold and doesn't taste good anymore) -Fried Calamari (Decent, nothing great. A bit oily as well) My recommended cheesecakes -Fresh Strawberry -Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake -Chocolate Tuxedo Cream -Fresh Banana Cream My borderline Cheesecakes -Tiramisu (good if you really like coffee) -Godiva Chocolate (very very...VERY rich) -Lemon Raspberry Cream (very fruity) -White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle (okay, but not to my liking) Last night was more of a miss on service; however, we did get seated within 5-10 minutes (we arrived around 8:30pm on a Sunday night).

They have a new pizza on the menu, pear, blue cheese and pecan, sounds different so I go for it. The pizza was actually delicious and I would go again just to have this one dish. The pear was perfectly cooked, the pecans added a nice crunch and the blue cheese was mellow adding a nice, simple flavor to the pizza. I would go back just to have this dish. My husband ordered the small mushroom pizza and it was delicious as well. Neither pizza was dripping in greasy cheese and I love that.

Good but not great.  For lunch I had the gumbo. Not bad at all for a non-southern restaurant but I ordered it without shrimp and the waitress totally blew this. As a matter of fact, she blew the whole meal. I asked her what was ""New Orleans Sauce"" per the menu which was used in the description of a pasta dish.. Her answer was.. ""it sauce in New Orleans"" to which I asked her if it was anything like ""Long Beach sauce"". She is probably still trying to figure that one out. She failed! She should know basic menu items.

I don't believe I've ever finished it.  Quite possibly the best chinese chicken salad ever.   One of my favorites things about dining at Cheesecake is their complimentary pumpernickel (my fave) and french bread! For me, it's a toss-up between them and Macaroni Grill's rosemary bread as best free bread at a chain restaurant.  I don't think I can ever leave this place without order a slice of cheesecake.  I recommend the tiramisu cheesecake or the red velvet cake cheesecake.  Be warned that a slice of the latter is double the price of a slice of any other cheesecake but it is damn worth it.  It is extremely rich so I suggest sharing, and between 2 people, is almost a meal in itself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=780

They are so delicious. The shell is so crunchy yet so buttery it just melts in your mouth.  Thai wrap, their sauce is so yummy most  appetizer are probably under $12.  Main dish I always get the pasta canjun jambalaya, really yummy.  around $16.  Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - kinda sweet, kinda spicy, I love it.

Now i  was ready for the sweet, and she asked "" Do you like Red Velvet?"" Our waitress was clicking with me in so many ways. She recommened the New-Red Velvet Cheesecake.  That was one of the best cheesecakes that i have had in a long time. I am partial to Red Velvet, but as a cheesecake, OMG! I was in Red Velvet Cheesecake Heaven.  The service was excellent, i was catered to by at least 3 other servers as well as my main person .

Lunch portions are huge still, if they could cut the dinner portion down to a third, that would be the perfect size. They have a new appetizer which we had, the white bean hummus. It was quite good, but still way too much food, appetizer, bread, meal, I felt like I was going to explode when we were done.  I'm a fan of about 6 dishes on the menu and tend to stick with them. I've found what I like there and they're always good dishes.

I had a bad experience here because they had the worst fettuccine alfredo. EVER. How the hell could you go wrong with a typical pasta? Apparently, they do. Anyways, onto the good stuff. I returned here for a friend's birthday. I love how they give out complimentary breads and butter. Keeps my mouth entertained until my dinner comes out. Don't eat too much of it though! Last time i got carried away and got full off of it -_-. But i love coming here even for their bread baskets. Most places would taste bland and give out old bread but this place is legit. The bread baskets comes in white or wheat bread. The wheat bread is so good that I even request only wheat bread now. They even toast it for you too and it tastes even better because the butter would just melt onto it. Wow I didn't realize I wrote alot just for their complimentary breads lol =X  So, I had their Louisiana Pasta. It is so good. One of the best pastas I've had. I think it was a bow-tie pasta with some thick cream sauce and Cajun seasoning all over. it came with fried hand breaded chicken. Most places  would disgust me by over doing it with the batter and deep fry it but here, it was super thin battered and you can actually taste the chicken, I thought it would be dry but it was juicy! Loved it. I'd come back here again for that =)  I had their Salisbury Steak entree for dinner here too before. They give out a big portion of it. It came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was under $15 too! and It was very good and filling. Their Caesar salad is actually pretty bomb. I had a side order of that and Mac and cheese. the mac and cheese noodle was pretty big and they used lots of cheese. I love cheese. I think it was like tillamook or something but whatever it was, it was good!

Eugine Y.,"Westminster, CA",423,310,141,3.0,9/11/2009,"Any place that sings ""happy birthday to you"" on the day that commemorates your birth automatically sucks, but you already knew that.  It's situated in the otherwise useless Bella Terra. You've seen their menus right?  Them s#its remind me the of Nascar with all their sponsors and whatnot on/in them.  You can't frickin' turn a page in their catalogue of a menu without seeing an ad for diamond rings or gazebos to put in your backyard or even ads for a realtor that I'm sure isn't making a dime nowadays. How'd I end up here?  Well, after hours of deliberation my senses and I were completely watered down, so we ended up here.  This what happens when it's late and all your other go-to joints are closed for the night.  Don't get me wrong.  I've frequented CCF's, but they're never my first choice.  Although, nothing I've had is bad, nothing I've had turns me on to the point where I have had to adjust my pants in the crotch region to make room for a you-know-what ;) Our server this last time was Jeff.  Yes, Jeff with his style-at-the-time emo hair cut was quite the friendly and upbeat fellow.  So friendly it was downright annoying.   So friendly I wanted to take my fist to his face.  You ever get that feeling when you order and the server says, ""oh excellent choice"", that he's just BS'ing you?  And even if you decided on the liver and onions, he'd be all ""oh, that is quite the exquisite choice, sir"".  I feel bad, cuz he was a cool @ss kid, but whatever, whachu-on-do-eh?  Now take your skinny jean wearing @ss and get me some of that complimentary sourdough! Well, we ended up with stuff off their new smaller-cheaper-wannabe-tapas-section.  Their southern fried chicken sliders were what I needed in my life!  I thought Paula Dean had made them.  I tip my hat to you CCF.  Everything else was mediocre including the stuffed mushrooms that looked more like hardboiled egg yolks.  Also, I'm not a fan of FuFu drinks, but I must say, their Georgia Peach drink looks like a peach and is quite pleasing.  Still though, I stuck to my Sapporo beer and handed the GF her drink back.  Unwillingly, but I had to keep my manhood intact ;) I'm not a Cheesecakeologist, so I'm no expert on the subject on Cheescakeology.  I will say this though, their carrot cake cheesecake is pretty damn good.  No BS.  You know how I do, I come correct with the praise. What I am though, is a sneaker fanatic.  I can't help but stare at the dirty@ss sneakers that used to be white that they wear.  Look at them next time. They'll amaze you. But yeah yeah yeah, they're workin' so it's cool. Once you're done with your meal, there's really no where else to go besides Barnes and Noble to get your free read on.  Don't go towards the movie theatre unless you are a fan of lame@ss teenagers wearing skinny jeans that hang halfway down their @ss.   Straight up real talk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=760

Most of the waiters are younger college age, they're attentive and work fast. Some waiters have been real helpful and made some good suggestions. Many of my experiences have been pleasant.   Food: Appitizers: The appitzers here are all average in taste. Nothing original but they have all the favorites like spinach/cheese dip, quesedilla, popcorn shrimp. Burgers:  Ive tried many burgers off the menu from the Classic to the Kobe beef. The burgers are just ok, I think the burgers at ""the Counter"" are cooked better. I don't think I'm gonna order anymore burgers here, Just too many better burgers in OC to be eating here.  Pasta: The pastas here are the items I generally enjoy the most. Anything with shrimp has been good. The portions on the pastas are always large, you can easily share between two.  Cheesecake: Sometimes I don't order anything except a slice of cheesecake. Their cheesecake isn't extraordinary but it hits that cheesecake spot pretty damn good. Every bite is like creamy soft calorie infused goodness. There's many different flavors and I'm unsure if I'll ever be able to try them all.

That is until I was taken out to lunch by a work vendor the other day. Being a huge cheesecake fan, what could be the attraction? How good can the cheesecake be? AMAZINGLY GOOD...that's how good.  But not to get ahead of myself, the non-cheesecake items are also really, really good. The menu is HUGE...strangely full of advertisements for other consumer establishments.  Started things off with the fire roasted artichoke which was pretty good. Had the Rib-Eye Steak Cajun style for my main course. Ordered it medium rare and it literally melted in my mouth. It was seasoned perfectly so there was no need for any A-1 (if it's seasoned and cooked properly, a cut of steak...especially a rib-eye doesn't need any fixin's like A-1 or BBQ). It was honestly the best piece of meat I have ever had from a chain restaurant. This rib-eye comes runner up to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in Vegas for best steak I have ever had.  Then there was the cheesecake...with maybe 30 to choose from I decided to check out the cookie dough cheesecake. I couldn't finish the whole thing and I do love me some cheesecake. Very rich and definitely worth the calories as a mega sweet treat.  The staff was on point with good service and the decor was quite interesting. A lot of brightly colored hand-blown glass work which I could only imagine is really cool looking at night.  I will be back for sure...maybe on a date night with the girlfriend...and I hear the wait for dinner can be really really long...so I think reservations are a must.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=800
James J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,5,1,1.0,7/17/2014,"Ok so we went to The Cheesecake factory this weekend and had the typical herding cattle experience, but this time the food was subpar. I ordered catfish and it lacked taste and was chew, but was alright. My wife ordered the fettuccini alfredo. The pasta and sauce was delicious, but she added chicken (a $3 charge) and it tasted and looked like it was boiled and not seasoned at all. At most restaurants when you add chicken to something the pasta will come out with a nicely grilled and seasoned chicken breast sliced and laying on top. This chicken was in odd chunks of all sizes and thrown haphazardly on top. It tasted bland. The first bite that she took she spit back out because it had a large piece of gristle in it. After that she didn't even eat the chicken. So we paid $3 extra for something that she couldn't even stomach. I'm hoping it was just an off night because in the past the food has been what has saved this place in my eyes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=800

Patric T.,"Westminster, CA",0,22,1,2.0,7/9/2014,"What a difference. Until today, this Cheesecake Factory location has been the ""go to"" restaurant whenever we have friends in town or just want an extraordinary meal and are willing to pay the high prices. I treated my wife to a birthday dinner and expected the same great-tasting food and attentive service as we've always enjoyed in the past. There seems to be a pall hovering over restaurants these days and the Cheesecake Factory seems to be its latest victim. We were seated soon and were led to a table whose waitress, at first, was attentive but then became less so as the meal went on. She pasted a phony smile on her face but she wasn't concerned much on getting our order or visiting our table during the meal. She ran through the ""specials"" as if she was giving a post-mortem account of how someone died. Asking for an additional round of bread was almost painful as, after I did, she gave me the look like, 'really'?  But what really caused us grief was the quality and condition of the food once if finally came. I don't mind waiting for hot and freshly cooked food, but when it comes out looking as if the chef's couldn't care less if it had any appeal, well, something's gone wrong. I ordered the Spicy Sesame Chicken and my wife, the Chicken Marsala. Let's start with mine. The chicken was cooked as I expected but, the brown rice was slathered in the sesame sauce, so much so that the rice was packed down and the sauce was floating in the dish. On the contrary, my wife's meal had little to almost no Marsala wine as part of the meal. She kept scraping the chicken on the dish hoping to gather some flavor. Our now largely missing-in-action waitress (she was not the euphemistic ""server"") came by only to re-fill our sodas and never inquired about our meal. Could I have spoken up? Of course and maybe I should have. I actually should have sent the food back and left. But we didn't want the reason we went there to be lost and we finished our meals. ""Did you leave room for dessert"" came the expected question from our waitress. ""No, sorry.""  Needless to say, her tip reflected not only her lousy service but the manner in which our food was prepared. Reading other reviews, I am not alone in my disappointment regarding our visit to Huntington Beach location of the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=800

Well...we sat for a while and after hearing a full conversation with our server and the host which included him stating that he did not know why he was being sat and that if he could please not be sat anymore he would greatly appreciate it...he said hello. He told us he was having a horrible night and couldn't wait to get out of there and being a server myself through college know exactly what he was talking about but in the customer service industry I do not think it is at all appropriate to communicate this fact with your client!! So...the night did not get any better. My husband was hungry and I wasn't sure what I wanted yet so I told him to order...but clearly held on to the menu to order in just a bit. He never came back and because we were in the corner no one walked by...my initial reaction was to chase someone down but my husband is a bit more reserved and asked that stay put! So my husbands food came...I shared because I was hungry too! His food was done...I finally then got my glass of wine I ordered. Never were asked how everything was...then  my husband had to ask for the check and he dropped it off and walked away. That was it! I never got any food...or even had the opportunity to order.

I have a thing for cheesecake (plain/ny style) and have tried a good amount of them from different places. It's my favorite dessert. One would expect cheesecake from cheesecake factory to be top notch cheesecake, but it's not. In fact, NY style cheesecake from my local pavilions bakery and honey baked ham, are vastly superior. First off, the cheesecake filling is very goopy, and has the consistency of pre-made filling cheesecake. Quality cheesecake is very dense, enough to stick a metal fork in. It wasn't. Also good cheesecake has a thicker outer skin, and a golden bronze color on the top. Didn't have either. The crust also sucked, and it's not as tall as NY style cheesecake is supposed to be. Price was a little steep. Was $7 per slice, and still not as good as a $4 slice from modest bakeries.  Of course the selection of cheesecake was very good.

I saw two other people waiting there before me. I stood there for a good 15 minutes and I got fed up. All I wanted was a freakin slice of cheesecake. I didn't think it would take so long! All she could've done was at least take my order, cut out a slice, put it in a dam box and hand it to me, and I would be happy. I don't even need the whip cream nor a freakin bag for it.

I decided to pick the basic soup and salad (because it was lunch) for fear of the chef forgetting to make what I ordered.

The only downside is that the parking right by the Cheesecake Factory is a 2 hour limit, but there is a parking garage over by the movie theaters, and if you're there for dinner and a movie, or shopping, parking there isn't too bad.

Lilian L.,"Midway City, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/25/2013,"Cheesecake factory, a fancy restaurant, can be an astonishing place to dine at  for a birthday dinner. It was great service and a waitress who welcome people the second they step in. There's not many cheesecake factories around Orange County. In fact, there are only 3 located around Orange County. One in Newport, Huntington Beach and Anaheim. Cheesecake factory has always been a busy place. Especially on weekends and occasions, an abundance of people come out to eat. Cheesecake Factory is not like any other restaurant.             The menu is a size of a bible. Their menu has over 200 different type of foods made from scratch each day. Combines to make an appetizing taste to everyone's tummy. Moreover, Cheesecake Factory have a portion of skinnylicious and small snack plates for those who stay fit and eat healthy. Just keep in mind that Cheesecake Factory has many varieties to choose from even for people who are eating healthy. So, this is definitely a place to go to if you haven't yet tried it already. There's also dessert like cheesecake and that obviously what this place is most known for. Known for their cheesecake. Many different flavors of cheesecake. Of course, original cheesecake too if you don't like any of the flavors that there is.             I've only been to Cheesecake Factory 5 times but I absolutely love it here! I've always wanted to try every single dish that they have. But, i only come here every so often. Only for occasional celebrations. The last time I've been here was for my friend's birthday. I honestly love the pasta here! Depending on what I crave that day, I usually only choose to look at the portion of pastas. It's the first thing I look for as soon as I grab onto the menu. Pasta Da Vinci is my favorite. The sauce is a light orange color that tastes just like thousand island salad dressing. The pasta is topped with sauteed chicken, mushrooms, onions and parmesan cheese. The taste of the creamy sauce is so delish. Melts into my mouths and feels as if I'm in heaven. All I think about is the greatness of how hot and tender the chicken and mushrooms are. Just by thinking about the name ""Pasta Da Vinci"" makes me ravenous already.            The location of cheescake factory that I go to is the one in Bella Terra on Edinger. Cheesecake factory is right next to Starbucks and right across from Buffalo Wild  Wings. There's not a problem about people wanting to sit outside and eat because there's a patio. Customers don't often complain about feeling frigid because there are fire pits and heaters to keep warmth surrounding the area. Workers try to satisfy their customers as much as possible and provide more than just a sufficient service towards everyone. The Cheesecake factory always has calming music for people to social with one another and the customer always seems to be jovial. This location at Bella terra is just like any other ones in Orange County. They're all the same and a utopian place to eat at every once in awhile but not a place to eat at daily. Thats why, its most known for having birthday dinners, going out on a date, or other gatherings               Overall, I rate this place a 9 out 10 because of the marvelous taste of different foods they have. I recommend to eat here. For ""first timers"" who haven't been here, its an amazing place. Not only the great taste of the foods but also the great service as well! Cheesecake factory fulfills my satisfaction and I can never be disappointed with anything that they serve. With over 200 types of foods in a large menu booklet, Theres not one thing that I don't like. The portion of different kinds of foods are so large that people often get lost in sight of what they want. In my opinion, definitely try to the pastas! I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do. Appetizers are another great choice as well if you're ravenous because it fills you up. Well, anything can fill you up actually. Because of how big the plates are, theres never too little. There's always an amount that's more than enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=680
Alina T.,"Cerritos, CA",0,19,1,1.0,8/29/2014,"Worst experience I've had at a restaurant ever. I drove 20 minutes to get here and this is the kind of shit that we're served?! My friend was really embarrassed to have taken us here. She was expecting something else, having gone to another Cheesecake Factory with great service and quality of food, and we ended up with below subpar food here. We got hard bread that was unedible. My friend got undercooked pasta, oily cold onion rings (he sent them back, and they still came back oily and cold). This Cheesecake Factory location is not the best for having dinner for friends. Also the 5-star review about the jambalaya was a lie. The reason why I think he or she posted it was for reasons of cash or because they confused this location for another Cheesecake Factory. To be honest the pasta was undercooked and a meat my friend was chewing...it was the type of undercooked-stringy tendon bad. And it was a mix of undercooked and overcooked meats. The buffalo blasts were the only redeeming quality of the dinner and one of my friends felt bad for the waitress because while the service wasn't that bad, the waitress deserved better because she was friendly and sociable. My friend does not recommend the pastas. It's not terrible but it's, at the very least, edible. If you're expecting college student homemade quality food  flavors (and your chef is your best friend who you love and you know is sensitive about hard crits and blunt honesty) that lasts in your mouth and you're alright with that, it's not as bad. The quality of the food they put out is not reliable. For the price Cheesecake Factory offers, the entrees are not that hyped up. The cheesecakes are the best of their menu and in retrospect this makes sense. Also I ordered Mac n cheese and just putting this out there a restaurant with the word cheese in it should not be serving Mac and cheese that someone with a complete lack of cooking skills could outcook. I have literally made better Macaroni and cheese. The bread is hard as stone and we asked for candles repeatedly but we never got any. I will never come back here again. I couldn't finish my meal. My friend ordered strawberry lemonade and he got something completely different. Also I'm here on a Friday, where there isn't even a lot business and as a person who works I cannot fathom how anyone would spend their hard earned cash on a 7 dollar bowl of absolute bland pasta that you can make for 50cents and I'm definitely not paying for the terrible cooking skills of the ""chef"" in the kitchen.  To make matters worse, at the end even the pen malfunctioned when I was writing the check. AND AS THE BIGGEST, WORST PART OF THE EXPERIENCE...one of my friends got seriously ill. We were watching uncomfortably as she literally hightailed to the restroom and threw up, for the second time. In one friend's opinion, the chef employed is bringing the reputation of the brand down. Only reason why I'm not giving this restaurant 0 stars is because it's not possible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=680
Jaimie E.,"New Brunswick, NJ",15,16,21,2.0,8/28/2010,"I really am done with dining at the Cheesecake Factory, the only reason you should be coming here is ... Surprise! Their cheesecake. That's it.  A lot of their food is overpriced for the way the food is prepared; I have experienced better meals at lower prices; why? Because these restaurants don't have a HUGE menu! The menu is enormous, it takes several minutes to figure out what exactly would be appetizing, when it comes out, you can TASTE the mediocrity, the instant powders, the stuff that you could have put together for a price less than what they have.  It's not all doom and gloom here at TCF, their cheesecake is phenomenal, something they seem to perfect and do well at. Every x amount of months, they come out with a new cheesecake to have people try. The new cheesecake, this time, was Piña Colada Cheesecake; it didn't appeal to me as much as the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake did. Yum! It's THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION that has me gnashing my teeth; I have been to TCF at Brea, HB, one in Arcadia, Pasadena and a few others. With this one!? I don't enjoy so much. I came back to this location for a 3rd chance, maybe it was a rookie cook? Maybe the recipe is really that awful tasting? Maybe I should have tried something that's more popular.  After looking at several reviews, and asking the waitress what entree was the most popular, I ordered the Spicy Crispy Beef and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Verdict? Gross. It's something you could have whipped up at home without paying $16.95 for. The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is not delicious, again, not for the price. The dish was nicely presented, the chicken was moist, the shrimp was nice, the taste of this dish overall was disappointing. It was as if one of the cooks took a ""Curry Spice"" seasoning powder and dumped it in a can of cream of coconut. The curry taste of the dish was artificial, just fake curry powder. The number of chicken and shrimp was rather small and there were more shreds of carrot and peas than rice.  The Spicy Crispy Beef was disappointing as well, I REALLY wanted to like this dish because I really enjoyed it when I had it at TCF in Brea. In Brea, their Spicy Crispy Beef was nicely crisped, not smothered in sauce, there was a huge portion of it, and you could taste the beef, taste the crispy exterior and that hint of sweet sauce. It reminded you of a Chinese take-out place where you'd order up your favorite calorie breaker and indulge in an evening of tasty junk food. The Spicy Crispy Beef experience at The Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach? Not likely the same experience, much more disappointing. In fact, it was more of an insult! The Spicy Crispy Beef was drowning.. Yes, DROWNING, in sweet sauce. The crispiness of the beef strips were no longer crisp because they were asphyxiated in tubs of the sweet gravy; the strips, were not strips.. There were six thick strips of beef. Granted, the beef was tender and meaty, but the strips were too thick to have been cooked properly to attain that crispy exterior, YOU EXPECT.  AND, it was more of an insult because it's as if the cook(s) expects me to like my Americanized Chinese food to be smothered in mountains of corn syrup gravy, so much that every other ingredient on my dish would cancel out. You know, I could've just asked for a funnel and a bottle of the Chinese style jus and chugged it myself.. And possibly for half the price!  The Cheesecake was great, it was what it always is -awesome. When you order it, it comes out rather quickly and you're ready to eat the only thing TCF has perfected. Cheesecake. The White Chocolate Macadamia nut caramel cheesecake was beautiful. No complaints there.  Service? On Par, never a bad day with the service at TCF, I enjoy the service, it's speedy, it's accommodating and they're always positive. How they manage to stay positive and well mannered in such a busy environment is amazing, I give them props.  So, the overall gripe that I have with TCF is their hot meals, their food is not worth the money, it really isn't. It's as if you're paying for the ""hip"" ambiance, the service, the HUGE portions of food they give you and the fact that TCF is always in demand and therefore they feel they can charge these really high prices and get away with it. Don't get me wrong, it's a restaurant, you're ALWAYS paying for service, sometimes ambiance and sometimes huge portions; I just don't think TCF deserves my money.. Unless it's cheesecake, and that's it! Note: THIS location is not the best, I gave it enough chances and none were satisfying.

I got the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta and my girlfriend got the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pasta and I have to say that both were very good and worth trying. The chicken in the pasta is probably the best chicken I've ever had in any pasta at other restaurants because of how soft and tender it was. The entrees here are pricey but they are totally worth trying. We then got the Oreo Cheescake afterwards and couldn't finish it because of how sweet it was. It just got tiring and boring.

Pillin L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1177,442,278,4.0,11/11/2010,"I walked into Cheesecake at about 5 o'clock on a Wednesday evening and I was pleasantly surprised. They have a happy hour!! Upon finding that out, we stroll to the bar and check out their menu. This isn't a TGIFridays happy hour. This is a The Cheesecake Factory happy hour. They had $5 appetizers. About 15 to choose from. And it's not just buffalo wings. Also on happy hour is small plates and snack. Prices varied from $5-$7. We decide to get the avocado egg rolls, roadside sliders and the ahi tartare. The ahi tartare was to die for! We wanted to order another one right after the first one came! It's small yes, but for 6.95, it's not such a bad deal. The avocados egg rolls were decent. I'm never a huge fan of them but it was tasty enough. The roadside sliders came with 4 sliders. Wow, they don't skimp on this happy hour. Only downside is their happy hour is from 4-6p.m.  I'm definitely coming back to try more things off their happy hour menu. It's a great deal. Drinks were a good deal too. mojitos, margaritas and long islands were all $5.Well drinks are $5 as well. I had a mojito and it was delicious. I asked the bar tender to make it with splenda instead of the simple syrup and she happily did it for me. Kuddos. I've eaten at Cheesecake many times and well. Their menu is very extensive.

An outdoorsy mall venue of some sort, similar to The Block, Irvine Spectrum, Victoria Gardens, etc... Cheesecake Factory - my friend girl (yeah, she's one of my bff's) and I went here, since she mentioned of an uber hot blonde friend of hers working here. It was a sunday early evening, we weren't too hungry, but thirsty and down for a drink or two (plus an appetizer combo of some sort). We came here to get away from the house, since we spent most of the day working on a car project of hers... Have you tried their Appetizer combo (forgot the actually menu name)? Geez, it sound just about right (size terms) on the menu, but can be a bit overwhelming for 2 people to devour. 4 plates of stuff rolled in, something like calamari, qeusadillas, mini sweet corn tamales, eggrolls/wraps, chips and spinach/artichoke dip, buffalo strips, pot stickers. It was a lot of food, and that's why we didn't opt in ordering entrees.... smart choice, lol! Of yeah, the bread is the bomb! Bottomless! The good and the wierd - we spent the evening checking out the talent (did I mention how cool my friend is! lol!). However, it seems we got bamboozled in our seats because we had to sit near this couple that was being all touchy-feely with eachother.

I had never been to this Cheesecake Factory location before, but I had been to others, and I have never ever had a good experience at The Cheesecake Factory. But a friend was having a birthday party here, so in I went. We had the Spinach and cheese dip as an appetizer. It tasted like they probably got it out of the Frozen food section from Ralph's. Very bland and stock, and meager portion considering the price. I felt like steak, and the only one that was really calling my name was the Filet Mignon. I should have saved that money because the filet was not flavorful, it was not tender, and it was not worth it. I will say they cooked it to proper medium-rare, but other then that, I should have ordered something else.  The problem with this place is evident if you study their menu. It looks like three schizophrenic chefs came up with it. They have Orange Chicken. They have white bean hummus. They have Pizza. They have Chicken and Biscuits. They have steaks. They have a Cuban sandwich. They have to decide what kind of restaurant they are! It is a total mess, they offer hundreds of items and none of them are worth ordering.  Ah, but what about the Cheesecake? Honestly, I have no idea. I think I have been to four different Cheescake Factories, and by the time desert rolls around, I have no faith that they won't screw that up too. Seriously, I only ate half of my filet mignon, the two onion rings and like 10 french fries that came with the steak. And trust me, I am usually a member of the clean plate club. I already felt like I wasted a bunch of money on a disappointing steak, I wasn't going to bother with cake. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Mark C.,"Monterey Park, CA",2,352,,3.0,4/21/2012,I always liked the factory till now. Our family goes to these types of restaurants for birthdays all the time. Most of the time bad experiences with the food when you go with a large group. Thought it would be better here. Not really at all.

Mike F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/31/2012,"We visited this location last week.  It was our third or fourth visit and it is always the same.  Each time I think I'll give them one more shot at making it better, but it just doesn't happen.  In summary, the food is decent, but the service and the attitude of the employees (including the manager ""Joe"") seems to be, with rare exception, very poor. First let me say that we drive a long way to get there, as we come from Long Beach, and have our family with us making a party of five.  We HATE to wait, so we always try to make a reservation.  While they supposedly do make reservations, their reservation system, if you can call it that, is of absolutely no benefit to their patrons.  The reason is that they only appear to allow reservations when they do not expect to be busy and you would therefore not need a reservation anyway.  Examples?  We wanted a reservation for lunch on the afternoon of Christmas eve.  When I called, I was told that they were only allowing lunch reservations before 11:30 AM  or after 3:15 PM.  I specifically asked the hostess if she meant they were already full between those times or if they simply were not allowing reservations between those times.  She very clearly stated they were not allowing reservations then because they expected to be full with lunch walk-ins.  We made a reservation for five at 3:30 PM, and when we got there the place was no more than half full.  The same situation occurred when I called to try to make a 1:30 PM lunch reservation this morning (12/31).  I was told that they were only allowing reservations for 11:00 AM, which is the time they open.  Why would anyone need a reservation for the time they open... of course they would have tables open at that time. To be fair, I also spoke to the manager ""Joe"" about this issue.  I was told that they expected to be busy and didn't want to be holding tables for 5-10 minutes for the reservations of people who might be late.  I suggested that they simply not hold the table, but rather simply put late arrivals at the top of their waiting list when they did arrive.  He said that would be unfair to those people who had actually been waiting.  I asked if he could explain this, as I saw no logic to this view since if the reservation party had shown up on time the people waiting on the list would still be delayed by the same amount of time until a table opened up.  This seemed to stump him, as there was a long pause before he finally stated that this was simply their policy.  I then asked why they would not allow ""call ahead"" seating, as nearly every other major chain allows, where you could call ahead to be put on the same waiting list you would be on if you walked in and put your name on the list.  I explained that I felt that such a policy was far more respectful of their patrons' time, because a person could call ahead, get an estimate of how long the wait was at that time, get put on the list, and plan to be at the restaurant by the end of the expected wait time, thus eliminating most or all of their wait.  He said he felt this would also be unfair to the people who had walked in an put their name on the list.  When I asked how, he had no specific response.  I explained that many other restaurants, including Claim Jumper, Mimi's Cafe, Outback Steakhouse, Chili's, On The Border, and some Olive Gardens, to name just a few, allowed call ahead seating because they were respectful of their custoimers' time.  Of course, his position was completely unchanged. If not for the fact that my girlfriend likes this place, I would NEVER patronize any Cheesecake Factory (and try to avoid them, if at all possible) due to the generally poor service and their very poor customer service perspectives, despite a decent variety and decent quality of food.  I believe there is no logical explanation for their reservation policy (or the lack of an intelligent one) except that they (1) simply want people to wait in the bar and buy alcohol, thus contributing to upping their sales of alcohol, or (2) simply don't care about the value of time to their customers.  I specifically asked ""Joe"" for any other logical explanation and didn't get one.  As far as I'm concerned, I only want to give my money to retailers who value me, my guests, our time, and our business.  Cheesecake Factory is clearly NOT one of those retailers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=900

The last time I ordered cheesecake factory for pick up. When I called to place my order I was placed on hold for literally 22 minutes. My call was never picked up so I hung up and called back. This time my order was taken right away. My food item in particular had some substitutions to it due to MAJOR allergies. When I go in to pick up the food, two out of the three items that were ordered were wrong. I kindly asked them to remake them. One was just completely wrong, and the other one (mine of course) had cheese on it which I am so allergic to. The people at the bakery were rude about remaking the orders even due to health reasons. Finally when I got the orders remade and returned to me I left. When I was home and eating my pasta, I found a chunk of beef in it (the pasta didn't even have beef in it to begin with) but once again I am allergic to it. I had to stop eating my entire pasta and throw it away. If I had not noticed the beef in my pasta and ate it I could have been hospitalized (yes that serious).

It took 45 min to get an app that consisted of a one inch piece of chicken, lettuce, rice noodles and carrots. THEN, we got a a vegetarian pasta dish and asked to add chicken to it. Meanwhile we asked them to turn the air conditioning off. For some reason a manager came over and apologized that it was so cold and said they were working on fixing the problem. The pasta came out and was pretty dry so we asked for olive oil. The tipping point was the chicken. They put two different types of chicken. There were chunks (about 5 pieces) of juicy moist chicken and grilled slices of dry chicken on top. I ate some of the pasta and a chunk of chicken. It was ok. Then I took a bite of grilled chicken. It was awful. I asked the ""manager"" why two types of chicken. Her suggestion was she could take off one of the charges for one of the types of chicken. I said "" why am I being charged twice for chicken when I only asked for ONE side of chicken?"" Her explanation is that the chunks are in the pasta line and they added the grilled chicken and she could take off ONE of the charges for chicken. Again I asked "" why am I being charged twice for chicken when I only asked for one side of chicken? Again she repeated the same bull#%!*.  We told her to take the pasta off and she said she would only charge for one drink.

Then we decided on the Evelyn's pasta with no cheese or butter and the veggie sandwich with a sourdough bun and no eggs. Guess what? They bring out the pasta with Parmesan on top! And a glistening brioche bun which clearly has egg and butter. WTF. Then the manager approaches us to apologize and offers to comp an item. The receipt comes out and it's not comped. Then we ordered the Asian chicken salad with no chicken with avocados instead. They charged $3 for the avocado when the server said we can substitute avocado instead of chicken. What kind of establishment is this? Needless to say we will not be coming back and reporting this to corporate so they can properly train their staff of food allergies and proper preparation.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=80

The waitress took our order right away brought water and bread fairly quickly then everything went to shit after that.  We waited until like 11:25p to ask the waitress about an update for our order to which she kept apologizing as if she didn't put in the order. We were just like okay thanks. She went to check on it and walked around for a few minutes and came back and said they're still working on your order I'm sorry. I then said it's ok but you could have at least updated us on our order.  She then went on a huge rant about her having all of these tables to attend to (the place is fairly empty since they close in about an hour). She also said she only has two hands and two feet and she can't go back to the kitchen and tell them to hurry. What's interesting is that it was only 2 of us and we ordered 2 appetizers, Mac and cheese balls and the tamale Cakes. She was so ridiculously rude. I just said ok to everything she had said. In the middle of her rant the food came out. Then she left. I think the manager asked her something about us and they just walked away.  My bf and I just looked at each other after and decided let's just leave this food and leave. We walked out and left. The manager chased after us outside and asked us why we left. We told him what happened and he just kept nodding his head and apologizing and told us goodbye and walked away. Ok, cool bro.  The worst. Never will be back and honestly don't think they care.

There was a little bit of a wait, about 10 minutes, but it did not bother us since this gave us time to preview the glass case filled with tempting cheesecakes. Each more decadent than the one before, it seemed. Once seated, we were immediately greeted by our waiter, and drinks were on their way. We decided to go with just a salad the first trip since we wanted the cheesecake. The salad was amazing. I had the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and my friend has the smaller appetizer salad Factory Chopped Salad. Both were delicious and nothing was left shortly thereafter. Drinks were continuously being filled, but without that overbearing feeling of someone not in your party constantly at your table. (That is just a little creepy at times.) Desserts were, naturally, a couple of slices of cheesecake. The first night we went, we had a slice of Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake and a slice of Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Unbelievable. We had thought we had gone on to heaven. The second visit we decided to skip the salad and go straight to the desserts, so as to skip that feeling of someone rolling us out the door. We had a slice of Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake and a slice of Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake, This was unfathomable that these cheesecakes tasted better than the first trip. We just couldn't believe it. The pricing is a bit steep, and that would be my only negative if I had to give a negative point, but I believe for an amazing night out with great service, wonderful atmosphere, and amazing food, the price is worth it.

This appetizer, however, is $12.95. I get it--salmon is expensive. I wouldn't have ordered this if I didn't understand this concept. The problem was that it came with 4  pieces that were about the length and thickness of a mini Twix.  Really. Maybe about 2oz. of salmon in the whole thing. For $12.95?

Just no, Cheesecake factory.  You have GOT to be kidding yourselves.  I don't want to pick on this location because I know that's just a company standard, but it's a terrible one.  Don't get this when you could easily spend that much on a full lunch order--even one with seafood.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=140

Bryan V.,"Laguna Beach, United States",337,72,114,5.0,28/6/2016,"I don't go to Cheesecake Factory often, but when I do, I always leave a satisfied guest. My last visit was probably the best experienced I had thus far. Good enough to actually make me Yelp about it.  I remember it was on a Saturday, June 18th, 2016 that my family, a party of twelve, came in to dine. I remember because it was my birthday, now you all know when my birthday is, so don't forget it! Anyways, Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations (at least for a party of twelve, they may for bigger parties), not the biggest fan of that, but none the less it is their policy, and I respect that. My girlfriend and I were the first ones to arrive and they quoted us 30 mins, that was totally fine because my family is always late anyways.  As we were waiting for the table, Chris, the manager, came and greeted us and assured us that if we need anything to please let him know and he would take care of it. From the moment I met Chris, I just picked up such a comforting and genuine vibe from him. As we were eating, there was a small hiccup with my food, and without saying anything he let me know that he issue was being taken care of and to not worry. He then let me know that the meal had been comped. Working in the restaurant industry, I've seen many management styles and felt like Chris' is outstanding. He did not need to do that but went out of his way to do so to satisfy the guest, and I loved the way he was so hands on and wasn't a back office manager. Long story short, I had a great time. I always get the Orange Chicken because of the perfect flavor, crisp and portion. Strongly recommend it! Also try the sweet corn tamales as an appetizer, you will not be disappointed. Chris, thank you again for a great experience.

Since I was taking out TWO ingredients, I asked the waiter if we could substitute the chicken with guacamole.  He later came back saying that management said no because guacamole is expensive. I would have agreed with him, BUT I was removing chicken which just as expensive as guacamole. The waiter was nice in the way he told me, but this decision by management was unreasonable.

Amanda A.,"Los Angeles, United States",14,78,73,2.0,17/9/2017,"I came to this specific Cheesecake Factory location after a hiatus from Cheesecake Factory in general because my last visits hadn't been particularly good. I decided to try this one because it looked really nice from the outside, so I wanted to give it a go.  We began by ordering something from a temporary/new menu, $5 'Nashville Hot' Chicken Nuggets. These were surprisingly good and probably the highlight of our dinner. The chicken was perfectly cooked and very tender. The sauce was spicy and really good. I also think it was a generous sized portion for $5. It went really well with the sauce. I liked it!  Then, we decided to try Chicken Madeira (chicken, asparagus, melted mozzarella with mashed potatoes and mushroom madeira sauce) and the Chicken Riesling (chicken, mushrooms, bacon, garlic, white whine cream sauce and buttered parmesan pasta) , another new item.  Considering the average price of these two dishes, I unfortunately have to say the flavours were clearly lacking. Both dishes were very under seasoned, the buttered parmesan pasta was basically just cold (!) pasta which made the dish kind of dry overall. The sauces for both dishes were vey watery/had no flavour and the Chicken Madeira felt very greasy with the mozzarella because it was more cheese than chicken. I know this is a chain restaurant, but the two main entrees were disappointing to say the least. Overall, the only thing we felt was worth stopping here for was the nuggets.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach
Leslie S.,"Costa Mesa, United States",676,535,469,5.0,31/8/2017,"Haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in awhile. The high prices and giant portions are too intimidating. However, when I can come here and work is paying I am all for it! We arrived during the weekday for lunch and it was pretty packed! I asked if we could wait for a booth and they told us there was no wait so that was good. We ordered some apps including the crab cakes, ahi tuna, and their signature avocado egg rolls. The apps were all delicious but you just can't beat the egg rolls! Maybe there was some misunderstanding but the waitress never came by to take my main meal order. We had to stop her when she was rushing by us. Not only that but I got my order put in so late that by the time it arrived I was full from all the apps and I had to go back to work. So I just had them pack it up right away. I told the waiter if I knew the food would have taken so long I would have ordered it to go. I enjoyed the fish tacos later in the week and they at least were delicious! I also ordered the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake slice to go and it was as delicious as I remember it.

Angie M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, United States",159,1230,4826,4.0,7/6/2017,"1pm on a Saturday, we came in with a party of 8 and had no problems getting a table.  We were quoted a 10 minute wait, but it was maybe 5.  The restaurant was not too crowded from what I could see. Our waitress was good about doing separate checks in the groups we asked.  Sometimes wait staff gets annoyed by that, but in my opinion its a lot easier when more than one person has to pay for a check.  Less aggravation in the end, in my opinion. I ordered a water, and noticed my straw had lipstick on it.  Or something, that looked like lipstick.  They come in the drinks, not in a wrapper.  Totally grossed me out, and I asked for an entirely  new water. I ordered the Orange Chicken.  I havent been to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time... and couldnt remember if I liked the Orange Chicken.  It was between that and fish tacos.  When my dish came, I asked for an extra side of the sauce for the chicken.  It wasnt dry tasting, it just didnt have much sauce on it, and I wanted more, for flavor and to add it with my rice as well. The service was good, always had full drinks, and our waitress was friendly and consistent. Not in the area often, but I would return here.

Chinese chicken salad is a easy dish, they can't even do that right.  2nd my 14 year old daughter had the kids brunch, she loves fruit and it did come with fruit, she said I'm not eating that fruit, looks like the fruits they put into the Sangira drink, sure enough "" it is"". That's not fruit for kids, what a joke.  Even a 14 year old girl knew what kind of fruit are in the Sangira drink. Just shows you, can't cheat the customers with crappy not fresh foods.

Katelin N.,"Garden Grove, United States",420,124,18,4.0,27/9/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the places I go to when I seriously don't know what I'm craving because it has a variety of everything. You got burgers, pasta, pizza, desserts, drinks, salad, rice dishes, protein dishes, brunch, low calorie dishes, appetizers, etc etc! This list goes on forever!! I actually get so sick of looking at the menu because it's loaded with items. Luckily I have been there so often that I know what I truly like and order every time I go. They always give you some bread to start off. All of my family and friends love love love the sweet moist wheat bread. We don't care much for the white bread. I usually get the tropical tea which is a passion unsweetened tea. My family and friends like the Tex mex bites for appetizer. They're like Mexican egg rolls if you will. Super flavorful! For my main course, I would usually go with the jambalaya pasta! So good and full of Cajun flavor. However there are times where it doesn't have enough flavor... but nonetheless that is my favorite dish there. Some other dishes that I've tried that I thought is also worth trying are: chicken chipotle pasta, the salads, and their skinnilicious menu which is their low calorie menu.   Of course they have their cheesecake as their main dessert. To me cheesecake is delicious at the first few bites but gets too overwhelming after eating too much but definitely try their cheesecake and don't try to eat the whole thing to yourself.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach

I highly recommend the happy hour at the bar from 4 - 6 p.m, as the appetizers are $5.95 and they have drink specials as well. Came here yesterday and met up with my sister for happy hour at the bar. We were able to find a seat easily and our bartender was very attentive and took our order right away. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, chicken sliders and regular beef sliders and couldn't finish it all. I recommend the chicken sliders as they come with deep fried chicken breast that has a slight pepper/paprika flavor and is very tasty!

I would of rather just waited a little longer for the pasta to be nice and soft than hard. I know the pasta isn't always like this because I've been here previously and had really good pasta.

Diana B.,"Orange County, United States",636,241,561,4.0,26/3/2015,"NO RESERVATIONS!! this can be a little frightening especially on a friday night. Ambience: cheesecake factory is known for their dark atmosphere and waiters/waitresses dressed in all white. There is outside seating with heat lamps that offer a little more light, but is still relatively dim compared to other restaurants. This location always seems to be buzzing with people no matter what time of day you go. Menu: the menu can be extremely confusing, with ads on some pages, long lists of food on others. You don't know whether you should be looking under the ""specials"" or under the individually categorized entree (meat, pasta, lunch, etc). It is definitely a very hefty menu, almost 30 pages long!! and with the bad lighting, how can anyone really see? Food: I always opt for the brown bread, and I only asked the waitress to bring brown bread, which she does without fail. The bread has a slight hint of sweet and is just delicious overall. We decided on the Salmon Genovese, which, to my surprise, was absolutely delicious!! The large piece of crisped salmon was placed over pasta balls (looked like rice) with a pesto sauce and sundried tomatoes. OH MY GOSH. I did not expect this dish to be this delicious. The combination of the crispy salmon and the sundried tomatoes is to die for. There are nuts in this dish, which I will ask them to not add next time, but YES, delicious!! Dessert: this two-page menu has such a long list of cheesecakes. How will you know which to choose?? I usually opt for the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries, but this time, we got the Godiva Chocolate and the Banana Cream Cheesecake. The banana was my favorite because it wasn't too sweet, and it came with fresh banana slices. The Godiva was a little sweet in my opinion. Service: it was a busy night but i think our waitress did her best to make it to our table whenever she could. We did have to wait a long time after our meal so we just decided to walk up to a host table to ask for a dessert menu ourselves.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=240

Tram N.,"Westminster, United States",0,7,,1.0,30/4/2017,"Have always loved the Cheesecake Factory, had many birthdays, great celebrations there. We frequent this location at least a couple times a month but this last time we went, we ordered a spaghetti and meatballs from the kid's menu for our son and barely through a few bites discovered a piece of plastic wrap in it. Brought it to the attention of the server and he asked if we would like it replaced. Since it was for my 2 year old son and he had barely taken a few bites I said please. The manager on duty came to our table and explained that it may have been the plastic from the cheese they have. We got the check and saw that they had put ""free/comped meal"" on it however, they had charged us for TWO spaghettis and counted the replacement as ""free"". A little misleading considering we didn't really receive any free nor comped meal because we still ended up having to pay for it. This made me remembered that the same thing had happened to us one prior time here with a piece of wax paper from their butter and the manager at the time had actually brought me a new one AND comped us for it. I don't mind paying for the food obviously since we came here to eat, just would like for my child's food to NOT include plastic in it. Don'r mislead people by labeling on the check as ""free/comped meal"" when in reality we didn't get anything for free.

I was too busy enjoying the taste to join in the table conversations.  My other friend, who has the same love for decadence and  shared the cheesecake, rolled their eyes to the back of their head for this guilty pleasure. It  was is amazing and left me speechless for a while. My friends and I enjoyed every minute spending time, catching up, and savoring this sweet course. A memory we will remember for a meal we have shared. It was a great way to end the night; sweet in more ways than one. Tip: I highly recommend for large birthday parties to have their celebrations late at night.  It is easier to get seating for large groups and you get better service. Also, I hope they will include an option for extra graham crackers squares for the cheesecake, which gives it that s'mores feel.

Every time I've been here over the last two years, the bartender(s) have been extremely difficult to pull away from their own gossip column conversations, stocking a fridge or making a drink.  As it just took 22 minutes to get anyone's attention, it was a busser, who I caught during her run to get me a plate after my food was delivered.  32 minutes to get salt and pepper...... A couple sat down next to me and after 15 minutes, I saw them still waiting patiently so I flagged down someone who could take their order....  As an FYI, there were only three people at the bar. Obviously, they were training a blind girl who was only stocking beer as a slave to the main barkeep who was stuck in the server well. As I continue to come here, I continue to expect and have horrible service.... I would love it if anyone of a mgmt position would care snout to oversee anything in this place. The couple next to me just shouted out to the back of the bartender, as they were ignored, may we please have some salt and pepper. She asks me if I need anything as she is in front of me and I reply with, ""nope, just please pay attention to others"". Albeit, I had already paid my tab, she responded with, ""there are only a few people at the bar""... Their bar service is simply and absolutely pathetic.

But after my experience the past two times I'm not sure how much longer I'll be coming back to this one. Last night I took my grandparents there to dinner. Only waited about 15 minutes to get sat but once sat it took someone 10 minutes to greet us and another 10 minutes to bring our drink and bread. We did not see our waiter for another 25 minutes to order. After that our food took forever and he never came by to ask if we wanted refills or more bread we had to stop bussers to ask them to refill us. When it came to bringing our bill he was obviously more attentive because he wanted a better tip.. food was delicious as usual just service was a total turn down.

When they brought me my food, I thought it was a joke.. The menu explains what shrimp scampi (shrimp, angel hair, white wine, etc) is and explains what the steak is (mushrooms, onions, etc).  I got the combination shrimp scampi and steak and was so shocked when i saw the dish. There were three small chunks of steak on the right and 3 pieces of shrimp on the left all for a spanking $22. No pasta, just three pieces of shrimp. This was a waste of money and time. Our party waited an hour for thus.  The service was great and very attentive but when I asked for a to go box, they didnt pack my shrimp and threw it away, just the steak..

Food This is why I marked down the restaurant two stars. I didn't want cheese or chicken in my burrito grande. Since I was taking out TWO ingredients, I asked the waiter if we could substitute the chicken with guacamole.  He later came back saying that management said no because guacamole is expensive. I would have agreed with him, BUT I was removing chicken which just as expensive as guacamole. The waiter was nice in the way he told me, but this decision by management was unreasonable. Overall, the food was decent. I am not sure I will be returning to this location since they weren't flexible with substituting the chicken.  Service Our waiter was very polite.

Amanda A.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,78,73,2.0,9/17/2017,"I came to this specific Cheesecake Factory location after a hiatus from Cheesecake Factory in general because my last visits hadn't been particularly good. I decided to try this one because it looked really nice from the outside, so I wanted to give it a go.  We began by ordering something from a temporary/new menu, $5 'Nashville Hot' Chicken Nuggets. These were surprisingly good and probably the highlight of our dinner. The chicken was perfectly cooked and very tender. The sauce was spicy and really good. I also think it was a generous sized portion for $5. It went really well with the sauce. I liked it!  Then, we decided to try Chicken Madeira (chicken, asparagus, melted mozzarella with mashed potatoes and mushroom madeira sauce) and the Chicken Riesling (chicken, mushrooms, bacon, garlic, white whine cream sauce and buttered parmesan pasta) , another new item.  Considering the average price of these two dishes, I unfortunately have to say the flavours were clearly lacking. Both dishes were very under seasoned, the buttered parmesan pasta was basically just cold (!) pasta which made the dish kind of dry overall. The sauces for both dishes were vey watery/had no flavour and the Chicken Madeira felt very greasy with the mozzarella because it was more cheese than chicken. I know this is a chain restaurant, but the two main entrees were disappointing to say the least. Overall, the only thing we felt was worth stopping here for was the nuggets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach

I asked if we could wait for a booth and they told us there was no wait so that was good. We ordered some apps including the crab cakes, ahi tuna, and their signature avocado egg rolls. The apps were all delicious but you just can't beat the egg rolls! Maybe there was some misunderstanding but the waitress never came by to take my main meal order. We had to stop her when she was rushing by us. Not only that but I got my order put in so late that by the time it arrived I was full from all the apps and I had to go back to work. So I just had them pack it up right away. I told the waiter if I knew the food would have taken so long I would have ordered it to go.

Our waitress was good about doing separate checks in the groups we asked.  Sometimes wait staff gets annoyed by that, but in my opinion its a lot easier when more than one person has to pay for a check.  Less aggravation in the end, in my opinion. I ordered a water, and noticed my straw had lipstick on it.  Or something, that looked like lipstick.  They come in the drinks, not in a wrapper.  Totally grossed me out, and I asked for an entirely  new water. I ordered the Orange Chicken.  I havent been to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time... and couldnt remember if I liked the Orange Chicken.  It was between that and fish tacos.  When my dish came, I asked for an extra side of the sauce for the chicken.  It wasnt dry tasting, it just didnt have much sauce on it, and I wanted more, for flavor and to add it with my rice as well. The service was good, always had full drinks, and our waitress was friendly and consistent. Not in the area often, but I would return here.

You got burgers, pasta, pizza, desserts, drinks, salad, rice dishes, protein dishes, brunch, low calorie dishes, appetizers, etc etc! This list goes on forever!! I actually get so sick of looking at the menu because it's loaded with items. Luckily I have been there so often that I know what I truly like and order every time I go. They always give you some bread to start off. All of my family and friends love love love the sweet moist wheat bread. We don't care much for the white bread. I usually get the tropical tea which is a passion unsweetened tea. My family and friends like the Tex mex bites for appetizer. They're like Mexican egg rolls if you will. Super flavorful! For my main course, I would usually go with the jambalaya pasta! So good and full of Cajun flavor. However there are times where it doesn't have enough flavor... but nonetheless that is my favorite dish there. Some other dishes that I've tried that I thought is also worth trying are: chicken chipotle pasta, the salads, and their skinnilicious menu which is their low calorie menu.   Of course they have their cheesecake as their main dessert.

We were able to find a seat easily and our bartender was very attentive and took our order right away. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, chicken sliders and regular beef sliders and couldn't finish it all. I recommend the chicken sliders as they come with deep fried chicken breast that has a slight pepper/paprika flavor and is very tasty!

It was a bit longer than that. After we got seated, we requested a high chair that they took a bit long to bring. My husband got something called Cajun shrimp with noodles. He said he only liked the shrimp. I order the filet mignon, and well done. Honestly it was over cooked on me he outside and raw in the inside. If I would've noticed at the restaurant, I would've complained. But I didn't eat much because I got full with appetizers and plus the dim light didn't help me much. I ate the following day for lunch and even after hearing it in microwave, the meat was still super raw. Well worth $30? No way.

Jessica P.,"Irvine, CA",1,13,2,3.0,10/2/2017,I'm not sure what the deal is with take out but the quality of the food was nothing compared to when I dine in. It's irritating because I am paying the same price! Specifically I'm talking about the Thai chx lettuce wraps. I got home and they literally put 3 strips of chx and the lettuce leaves we're old and obviously the bad edges had been ripped off which is not a big deal but the pieces were so small and almost white. When I eat In I always get these HUGE green beautiful leaves and a good portion of chx. This isn't the first take out meal that was disapointing from here.

I assumed the taste would have been with imitation crab meat, but it wasn't! It tasted like actual crab, but who knows?  -BUFFALO BLASTS was full of deep fried goodness. Initially my friend and I believed it was buffalo wings, but when they delivered it out, it was basically chicken meat with some buffalo flavoring, covered in deep fried dough.

I ordered a Kettle One Dirty Martini. This is my go to drink because I always order it and know what it tastes like. It did not taste dirty and I could not tell if there was any alcohol in it. I didn't even catch a buzz. I don't know what it was but it seemed more like cold slightly sweet and salty water. During our 2 hours there our sections waiters switched out 3 times and our serves were never the same. We ordered a couple appetizers and entrees. The appetizers were fried and hard to mess up. They came out hot. My wife ordered chicken and biscuits, I ordered steak Diane. Her chicken and biscuits looked like it sat under a heat lamp all day. It was tuff, rubbery, the biscuits were tough and sad looking. She could've got better chicken and biscuits at Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). My Steak Diane did not look like Steak Diane. I called the waiter over and asked what it was. He said it was Hibachi Steak but it was missing the onions, bean sprouts, pesto and tempura asparagus... WTF! We go out to eat as a treat. When we go out to eat we expect food that is much better than we can make it. In the amount of time it took them to bring us terrible food I could've made the same food... only a 100 times better.

I've had at least 10 different types and I think they were all delicious. I've had cheesecake in Manhattan, New York. It's very dense & rich. The original cheesecake here comes very close.

Our waitress comes up and asks what we'd like to drink and my husband kindly tells her that we would like a different seat and explained our last seating situation.

The Club was served with fries and I was pleasantly surprised with how moist the chicken was. The Pasta had a nice kick to it and the sauce was very good. As always, the portions at CF are quite hefty, so we ended up getting our half priced slices of cheesecake to go. My bf ordered the classic Strawberry cheesecake, while I ordered the very magical Lemon-Raspberry!!! Nom nom nom.

Lisa V.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",42,12,23,5.0,8/28/2017,"Honestly....""Cheesecake"", any restaurant that has this word in their Title is sure to be a hit with The Ladies So I must admit, there was a point in my life when I was a single mother of 3 that I could not even imagine dining at such a Prestigious Restaurant. In my mind you had to have the Big Bucks to eat there.  That was okay though, I realized I needed to live up to it, and I did. No shame in that. Since I am new to the ""Yelping"" community....lol, I just started about 3 weeks ago to pretty much Give Credit Where Credit is DUE.  That's all.  My husband has been ""Yelping I guess since 2015"" and since he spends hours on his phone posting this and that I figured what the heck, can't beat um...join um.  So here I am and I realized it does make a difference. I don't review establishments for my personal gain as some do....I honestly give my opinion about my ""Experience"".  With that said, I have to admit, The Cheesecake Factory is One of My Top Five choices to dine. I am very picky. I figure if I work hard to earn my income when I do spend it, it should be spent well. I have always believed we as consumers can pretty much have whatever we want....for a price.  Now to my review. I have been to several Cheesecake Factory Restaurants and their service is consistant throughout. More recently My Mother-in-Law have been able to enjoy each others company and we have made several lunch and brunch dates to The Cheesecake Factory.  You can't go wrong.  The building,  the decor, the service, the professionalism of their employees and my favorite,  their incredible freshlu cooked meals are worth every cent. They have an extensive menu, their employees are well groomed,cordial and attentive to their customers.  Their Decor and cleanliness is very appealing as it should be. After a meal, you still have the opportunity to stop by their bakery which has a plithera of cheekcake choices.....If you have a sweettooth or a weakness for Cheeskake.....""Walk Away from the Counter.....slowly""....lol Cheesecake Factory is a must!

No visit has been spectacular but we enjoy the large selection that Cheesecake Factory has to offer.  On our last visit, I ordered a jambalaya pasta and the kitchen FORGOT TO OUT SAUCE on the pasta. I didn't bat an eye, mistakes happen. The waiter was less than apologetic and the manager didn't even bother to stop by. Unfortunately, it gets worse.  Last night, we brought some friends visiting from out of town here for dinner. I ordered a dish called ""bang bang chicken & shrimp."" I began eating, dish tasted ok but the flavor was definitely off... I go to take a bite of rice and notice something hard sticking out of my rice once I took a bite. Thinking it was starch from the bottom of the pan, I go to remove it. Much to my surprise IT WAS A HUGE WADDED PIECE OF PLASTIC WRAP. Not only was it disgusting that I had literally just eaten plastic, but it was extremely alarming that I was the first person to see this literally POKING OUT OF MY RICE! You can clearly tell this food is not made fresh daily..... The worst part of the whole experience was the manager who came over and tried to tell me that the plastic wrap was from the kitchen moving the rice from the pot to the plate so it wouldn't stick to the cooks hand. Could be believable EXCEPT IT WAS WADDED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RICE! So, either your manager was lying OR your cook out it there on purpose during the meal prep. Either way, it's disgusting.

Geri S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",2,5,1,1.0,10/28/2017,"This place sucks!! If you are hungry don't bother coming here. If you hate over air conditioned places definitely don't com here. It took 45 min to get an app that consisted of a one inch piece of chicken, lettuce, rice noodles and carrots. THEN, we got a a vegetarian pasta dish and asked to add chicken to it. Meanwhile we asked them to turn the air conditioning off. For some reason a manager came over and apologized that it was so cold and said they were working on fixing the problem. The pasta came out and was pretty dry so we asked for olive oil. The tipping point was the chicken. They put two different types of chicken. There were chunks (about 5 pieces) of juicy moist chicken and grilled slices of dry chicken on top. I ate some of the pasta and a chunk of chicken. It was ok. Then I took a bite of grilled chicken. It was awful. I asked the ""manager"" why two types of chicken. Her suggestion was she could take off one of the charges for one of the types of chicken. I said "" why am I being charged twice for chicken when I only asked for ONE side of chicken?"" Her explanation is that the chunks are in the pasta line and they added the grilled chicken and she could take off ONE of the charges for chicken. Again I asked "" why am I being charged twice for chicken when I only asked for one side of chicken? Again she repeated the same bull#%!*.  We told her to take the pasta off and she said she would only charge for one drink. When the bill came back she charged for both drinks and the app. I asked her to take the app off too. The bill came back and she charged for both drinks.  So I paid for the privilege of being frozen out and no dinner.

Cristina R.,"Orange, CA",0,10,67,2.0,7/31/2017,"Tonight, I received terrible customer service from the bakery dept at The Cheesecake Factory at Huntington Beach. I just walked in the door and asked the crowd of people waiting where was the end of the line. While it was not too problematic that no one spoke up, my name was called by the employee at the cash register. I tried to sidestep my way to the front but no one would let me through. Then, I tried to speak with an employee to the side, but I could not catch her eye. So I stepped up after one other customer paid and asked the employee if she remembered calling ""Cristina"". She responded in an unprofessional manner, ""Yes. A long time ago."" I explained, ""I thought I heard you, but another customer moved up."" My thought that that the other customer could have the same name as me did not seem to be of import to the employee and she rang me up. I tipped as I deemed appropriate and as I was calculating the total, a customer walks up to the register and tells me, ""Miss, there's a line."" I explained again, ""I'm aware, but she called my name. And no one responded to me earlier or let me come up to the front when my name was called."" He chose to ignore me and face the employee, who chose to help him as she previously. I bid them both a good-night and walked out, with full intention of speaking with a supervisor.

Then we decided on the Evelyn's pasta with no cheese or butter and the veggie sandwich with a sourdough bun and no eggs. Guess what? They bring out the pasta with Parmesan on top! And a glistening brioche bun which clearly has egg and butter. WTF. Then the manager approaches us to apologize and offers to comp an item. The receipt comes out and it's not comped. Then we ordered the Asian chicken salad with no chicken with avocados instead. They charged $3 for the avocado when the server said we can substitute avocado instead of chicken.

She went to check on it and walked around for a few minutes and came back and said they're still working on your order I'm sorry. I then said it's ok but you could have at least updated us on our order.  She then went on a huge rant about her having all of these tables to attend to (the place is fairly empty since they close in about an hour). She also said she only has two hands and two feet and she can't go back to the kitchen and tell them to hurry. What's interesting is that it was only 2 of us and we ordered 2 appetizers, Mac and cheese balls and the tamale Cakes. She was so ridiculously rude. I just said ok to everything she had said. In the middle of her rant the food came out. Then she left. I think the manager asked her something about us and they just walked away.  My bf and I just looked at each other after and decided let's just leave this food and leave. We walked out and left. The manager chased after us outside and asked us why we left.

Marwan K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",42,44,142,3.0,8/11/2017,"My girlfriend and I have decided to review restaurants based on five criteria: Food, Alcohol, Cleanliness & Ambiance, Service and Value/Price We came to Cheesecake Factory at Bella Terra for my girlfriend's dad's birthday.  FOOD My girlfriend and I shared the Jambalaya and it was pretty good.  The chicken was seasons well.  My girlfriends parents had the Grilled Fresh Salmon with a side of Shrimp and the Seared Ahi Tuna with a side of shrimp.   They both enjoyed their meals especially the shrimp.  However, the sides weren't the best.  We did not have cheesecake for desert, we were full.  Overall the food was decent for what it was and although the rest of the experience was not good, we give the food 3/4 of a star.  ALCOHOL I had a Whiskey Smash and my girlfriend had a Well Mannered Martini.  My Whisky Smash was a tad sweet but over all really good.  They pour generously here so that is a plus.  The Well Mannered Martini was good and you couldn't taste the blue cheese olives in the drink.  Overall the drinks are 3/4 of a star.  CLEANLINESS & AMBIANCE  The restaurant and bathroom are relatively clean for the foot traffic Cheesecake Factory has which tends to be a lot on a Saturday.  The ambiance is also a little loud for my taste but it is a chain and that is part of the experience.  Overall the cleanliness & ambiance gets one star.  SERVICE The service was horrific.  Our waiter Nathan G did not seem like he wanted to serve the table at all.  When he did come to the table to take the orders and my girlfriend was translating what she was ordering for her parents he got annoyed because they changed their minds one time.  Also he never let us know how late the appetizer was going to be.  It eventually came out after the meals so we sent it back.  Finally he didn't come by once to ask how we were or if we wanted desert.  We have had a string of good service so we were due, but this was bad.  Overall the service deserves zero stars a complete disappointment.  VALUE/PRICE The restaurant is a good value we spent $111 on three meals and three drinks without tip.  Obviously the tip was not very good on this night.   Overall the value/price receives 3/4 of a star.  In conclusion the restaurant is 3.25 stars.  I really wanted to give it closer to 2 stars but it did check off the necessary boxes I suppose.  I definitely won't be back for a meal here again unless someone specifically requests it for a birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=40

I thought that there was too much sauce, but it was still good! The sauce is on the sweeter side. Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic: Amazing! My favorite pasta here is the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta, but this ones up there as well. Portion is HUGE. Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi: My sister really liked this! Sauce in this was very different. It wasn't sweet like the one on my plate. It went really well with the steak. I didn't try any of the other dishes, but I feel like Cheesecake Factory has a lot of really delicious foods! Salted Caramel Cheesecake: Good! I wish it was a little saltier, but it definitely hit the spot. I would order this again.  Service at Cheesecake Factory is always a little slow for me... but it's not terrible. The girl who helped us found out it was my birthday and got a few coworkers to sing to me and gave me a free small ice cream with whipped cream. It was very nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=40

Jennifer T.,"Westminster, CA",47,16,119,4.0,7/25/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a very affordable, high quality restaurant. Food + Service = :) INSIDE: The restaurant allows you to choose to sit inside and outside. I have sat at both during dinner hours. If you are seated outside, it is a very calm and relaxing area even if there are cars around. Not loud at all, and they put out fire stand thingys (what are the called omg??) when it gets cold. Inside, you'll sit at a table or booth. Very clean and spacious.  SERVICE: Each time I go, servers will usually leave their shift and another server will substitute in. I love how nice and informative they are when they switch off their shifts. I get to meet my new server and things go on as if it didn't happen. One thing I love about this restaurant is how it ALWAYS refills my water even if I've sipped on it twice. It's the little things that matter. During all my visits at Cheesecake Factory, I have only gotten my order wrong once. My waiter will correct it, and my replacement comes about 5-10 minutes later which is fine with me. (I had ordered the Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls, but I received some Skinnylicious salmon dish).  THE FOOD: I love the menu selection at Cheesecake Factory. It includes anything you can think of. I love their fries and will order it despite what kind of dish I'm ordering! However, I docked one star off this review because their Cuban Sandwich. This sandwich came off as very, very greasy. It tasted pretty bad, and I felt like it was something made to be microwaved and was heated with a grill instead. It was a mess eating it. I love all the pastas here, but just that sandwich makes me feel a little sick.  THE CHEESECAKE: Oh I always gain a million pounds after leaving this place anyways, so I obviously order the cheesecakes here! I am a sucker for Red Velvet Cheesecake, and I would eat all of the cheesecakes on the menu if I could in one sitting. It's classic and the price is unbeatable.  BOTTOM LINE: -Always recommended -Service and most of the food is well loved by me",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=40

Despite being slammed and busy my wife and I got seated in 15 mins on a Friday night in OC which anyone will tell you is no mean feat. I ordered the factory make your own omelette with bacon, ham, cheddar and Jack cheese. I thought I would order something a little different and I got fries instead of the potatoes but I ordered a side of syrup. Our waitress came through and my fries where amazing. The omelette was equally amazing. I got a piece of lemon meringue cheesecake to go. Even though we where seated next to a family of four and a large party of 12 our server Yuki never forgot us or left us hanging. As I have said before good service is always worth paying for.

Jonathan N.,"Anaheim, CA",0,20,14,3.0,8/14/2017,"SERVICE I've been to this specific Cheesecake quite a few times with generally mediocre to excellent service (really depends on your server). There have been 2 occasions out of 5-6 where the food took over an hour to come out, and the drinks we ordered almost just as long. It would've been understandable if it were busy, but it wasn't at all. We had to follow up 3 times with our waitress before what I assumed was the manager came out to personally apologize and deliver our food.  FOOD It's Cheesecake Factory - portions are generous (sometimes), food is food, and great selection for a casual dinner. WAITING Comparing it to my go-to Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach, the lines are pretty much nonexistent.  In the end, it's a decent location but when compared with the Redondo Beach location, service doesn't compare. They have more efficient staff with (what seems like) more genuine enthusiasm for their work, which for me always leads to bigger tips and more satisfaction.  I would've given it a 5/5 if it weren't for the 2 occasions of extremely poor service and failure to make up for their error from management. It varied too much to give it any higher than a 3/5. If you're looking for great service for a group of family or friends, I'd try another restaurant. If you're looking for vast selections of food at good value with minimal wait, than this place will do just fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=40

Today was my son's birthday and the tradition continues for birthday dinner and some cheesecakes at Cheesecake Factory. We were greeted by a very cocky server and he stayed that way for the entire meal.  I don't know what we did wrong except maybe for the fact that we were Asian?  I just felt He was prejudiced because he seemed better at the other tables. Me, my wife, my 14yr son and 12yr son all felt the same about his attitude so it had to be him right?  And we don't normally complain about bad services but today we left this establishment with a very sour feeling.   And yeah my son didn't want any cheesecakes for dessert either.  He asked if he can get dessert somewhere else and wanted to leave as quickly as possible. Will never comeback to this establishment again.  Even the food seemed very off today too.  How can it be godd when you have a sour mouth.

They tell me most folks don't order it and order mosly pasta dishes at this restaurant but if you are like me and need a perfect steak now and again oder this baby! It's very large...thick..and juicy! It comes with mashed patatos and veggie. I ask them to add mushroom gravy to the mashed and it is yummy! Also start with a cup of potato soup...to die for when you dip their crusty white bread in it. Of course finish off with a slice of cheescake and coffee and then you can roll out of there...The steak is about $30.00 but worth every bit of it.

Excuse me? We waited for over 50 minutes for a table and then were accused about lying.

The downside here is that they don't take reservations on a weekend night so you have to physically come in to put your name down. Every time I come, there is always a wait. I am a total bread and butter lover so the best part about this restaurant is that they bring you this to start off with while looking at the menu! The brown bread that they serve is so good! I think it's rye bread but I call it ""chocolate bread"" because that's what it looks like hahah. The servers are always nice about it when I ask for more:) I love the pastas here! I ordered the pasta da vinci dish which was delicious. If you love mushrooms, this is the plate to choose! It comes with a mushroom wine sauce.

Parking close will never happen, unless its your lucky day! So, save yourself the trouble and park far away and walk. I have been eating at Cheesecake factories in So Cal well before any Social media existed. I have been to this location in Huntington Beach  multiple times to celebrate Birthdays and just because type of meals for parties of 2-4 people. It has always been a go to place since its such a crowd pleaser. Buuuuuuuuut  each visit here in HB has always been a different experience. Some good, some not so good. A few times our order was mutilated, forgotten, or completely jacked up. Some visits our service were spot on and a perfect experience. I have eaten inside, outside and at the bar. In my opinion the bar is the fastest and easiest place to eat.  Today I felt service was decent, but rushed.  Service has never been consistent here,  which is why the 3 stars. Good servive to me, makes it or breaks it.  Service is really hit or miss depending on the time. The wait is anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. After placing your name, take the buzzer and wait. They seem to want to seat you, and quickly get your order in and send you on your way. I understand, they are busy and need to move the show along to serve people in a timely matter, but I ALWAYS feel rushed here. Helllllllooo....their menu is like a novel. I do require more than 5 minutes to know what I want.  Food is great here. I gravitate towards their salads that are way to big, burgers, Philly and the cashew chicken. All of them are great. Especially paired with the loaf bread they bring out. They have something for everyone here. I mean everyone from Carnivores to Vegetarians, that takes them on a trip around the world with their diverse cuisine. Their menu is endless. They even have skinny portions, just in case your counting calories. If your not counting calories their desert menu is amazing, offering any kind of cheesecake, some chocolate cake, ice cream, ect.  Drink wise, refillable Coke products, iced teas, strawberry lemonade are all perfect to wash down a delicious meal. If your into wine and bear they have that too. There is also Expresso drinks, which I am not a fan of. They are not as strong as I like them. Lunch for 4 was about $100. Luckily, Daddy BigBucks usually pays for us, especially since we were celebrating my Birthday today!!! 3 star service....4 star food.

Waited on hold for 10 minutes before Rachel got back on the line. She was confused and rude in her tone and service. We did not complain. She took the order, she was communicated to that we were paying by gift card, she was confused. My husband asked how long the process would take. She relaid approximately 25 minutes.  My husband drove to the restaurant within the timeframe, parked and called the curbside number. The hostess cut him off and put him on hold for 10 minutes. She got on the line finally then disregarded what he was saying and transferred him to make an order. He called back. He was placed on hold again. When the gal answered she asked him to drive around and come back. EXCUSE ME? My husband got a manager. In total it took staff about 45 minutes at curbside PLUS the 25 minutes when the order was placed to hand the food, now COLD, to my husband. Add another 10 minutes to figure out billing, surprise we paid by gift card - like they were not told multiple times.

Tonia B.,"Anaheim, CA",387,15,,2.0,2/1/2017,"I, normally, never write Yelp reviews, but the service I received today was inadequate enough for me to take the time to share my experience.  First off, I have work experience in the food industry. Therefore, I have an understanding of what it is like to deal with complicated customers or even just trying to get through a tedious shift on a bad day. I have been to this location recently in December and received the same subpar service but not enough to the point of publication. The repeat of a bad experience, regardless of whoever served me, had already set a mood.  My party of four was seated quickly. Alexandria, our waiter, promptly addressed the menu and was attentive to us from the very beginning, until we were waiting fifteen minutes for her to put in our order. She was stationed in an area that had about five distinct parties of three or less; therefore, a small wait was understandable. However, what we did not appreciate was the fact that we were waiting while she was chatting with another coworker at the register. It was not until I flagged her down as she was, again, passing her booth, that we finally put in our orders. She was very nice about accommodating to our orders, giving us advice about customizing our entrees, and suggesting me a dish that fit my preferences that was not my initial choice. So, we waited and noticed that the food was taking a while to come out. Thirty minutes had passed and the first dish came out. Just one. Normally, when only one dish comes out, other dishes follow right after, but we were left waiting another 10-15 minutes for two more dishes. At this point, we were agitated because we were hungry, like all humans. What was interesting was that another server came by to tell us that the last dish had been sitting on the counter for some time and got cold; therefore, they had to toss it up again for it to be warm. The very first dish had to be taken back to warm up as well. My dish was not the dish I had originally decided on with her upon ordering. The last dish was the only dish that did not have complications to it. When we received our bill, one dish was charged as a dinner entree when we had all said lunch sized portions. Though it could have been a misunderstanding, I thought it was a bit peculiar that one person out of a party of four who came during lunch special hours would order a dinner entree. I think she should have clarified our orders before giving them to the kitchen for the sake of that mistake.  Alexandria addressed our problems professionally and still maintained a level head despite the tension and frustration that came with the miscommunication. Mistakes are okay; they are what makes us human. However, when mistakes are being repeated and unattended to, they become problems and that was the case here.  Please consider being more organized or stationing employees better throughout the vicinity to ensure that each customer gets the undivided attention that comes with having exemplary customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=120
JEWELS Z.,"Placentia, CA",94,12,,3.0,6/15/2017,"I had been looking forward to the teriyaki chicken, as it is a favorite of mine, from their menu. As usual, it was very good, except for the bananas, which had been seasoned with pepper. However, my friend ordered the four cheese pasta,  which took too long to be brought out, and was surprisingly salty. We informed Rachel,  our server,  when she came to clear the plates, and she saw that more than half portion was still left, and her response was ""oh, no"", not can I get you something else, or something to that effect. I was really disappointed, and for that reason I only left her a $5 tip, despite being a very generous tipper. It's a shame their customers are not valued, to try to keep them happy.

Maila H.,"Orange County, CA",398,368,4584,4.0,12/28/2014,"After a day of shopping at Bella Terra, we decided to finish the day off by going to Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the one in Brea and Anaheim but this was a first for the Huntington Beach location. Last weekend of 2014, we expected the wait to be longer than usual. Went inside to give the hostess our name and was given a wait time of 30 min. Not to bad after seeing the amount of people waiting inside. The computer system had just crashed so it was a bit chaotic. Hostesses and management walking around like chickens with their heads cutoff was entertaining to watch while we waited for our seats. After waiting 20 minutes, our names were called and we were seated in the patio. Large patio area seating with fountains, heat lamps and decor lighting. Beautiful sunny California weather and people watching with the only downfall, the restaurant is located right next to the freeway. I inhaled more carbon monoxide than fresh air. Sometimes you can't have it all. FOOD- The Cheesecake Factory has one of the most extensive menus and is not only limited to Cheesecakes.  - Small plates - Snacks - Appetizers - Salads - Pizza - Hamburgers - Sandwhiches - Pastas - Steaks, Chops, Fish & Seafood - Specialties - Sunday brunch With so many different entrees, it made choosing difficult. Luckily, I wasnt hungry so I took my time ordering. I even passed up on the free breadsticks. I decided to order the Bang Bang chicken with shrimp and babes choose the Rib eye steak with steamed broccoli. Bang Bang chicken with shrimp was a spicy Thai dish with curry, peanuts, chili and coconut served over brown rice. The perfect definiton of DELICIOUS! I love me some Thai but this by far takes the crown for best Thai curry dish. Ironically, I wasn't even dining at a Thai restaurant. I sampled the rib eye cooked to medium. It wasn't the best presentation but the flavor and tenderness made up for it.  DESSERT- Finished the meal off with Pineapple upside down cheesecake with a side of vanilla ice cream. It wasnt my first choice as they had ran out of the seasonal Pumpkin cheesecake with pecans. Sad. The cheesecake was a little too sweet and the combination of upside cake and cheesecake was a bit off. Next time I'll stick with the red velvet or the carrot cheesecakes. Can never go wrong with those two choices. SERVICE- Our waiter was friendly and provided us with good service. The only bad thing I could say is when I asked him what was good on the menu, his reply would be "" everything "". Even when it came to Cheesecakes he said "" everything was good "". Suggestions would have been helpful, although I probably wouldn't have taken them. Other than that, no complaints. PARKING-  Cheesecake Factory valet parking $5.00 and general parking is free. Finding close parking is always a hit or miss, but there plenty available parking spread across the shopping center and restaurants. OVERALL EXPERIENCE- Not the biggest fan of restaurant chains, but Cheesecake Factory is an exception. Great menu, delicious food and decent prices. The Cheesecake... well some flavors are to die for! 4 Stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=120
Remus M.,"Orange County, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/23/2016,"Cheesecake was really the only good thing. Everything everything else really wasn't good, especially not for the price.

Mind you, we didn't even have our drink order in yet. He came out, didn't even apologize, had an ""I don't care"" attitude, took our order which was another 30 minutes! This was outrageous!

Second issue was the food, my wife's pasta was hard and undercooked. My pasta was so raw that it was crumpled together, I couldn't even break it apart with my fork. I showed the manager and picked it up with my fingers and it stayed as straight as my straw. It was spaghetti by the way. The bright spot was that the waiter was good, he gave us great service all around. But what pissed me off the most was when the bill came, the manager had the decency to tell me that he hooked me up by taking away my plate from the bill. I took 3 bites out of my plate before I asked you to remove it without replacing it. He didn't hook me up, he did his job!!!!

Place is usually pretty busy but the wait to get a table isn't too long.  The only gripe I have is the price of cheesecake.  $7 - $8 a slice is pretty expensive but it's so yummy!  Also why do they have advertisements on their menus?

I explained the situation and he offered to either replace it with something else or he could have more pasta added to it. I opted fomore pasta. When the plate returned it had twice as much as it had before. Good manager, great dish. Excellent blend of pasta, marinara, shrimp and sausage. I would order it again, except with a lot of pasta.

The food was always great, the servers treated you well and it was an experience that was just different. Now days, every time I go it seems like a huge ordeal with long wait times, an extremely crowded front area and food that lacks any real flair. Service there can still be quite good but it seems that they are really just churning the customers as fast as they can to deal with the crowds.  I had the Jambalaya pasta with shrimp and it was indeed spicy, great for me and was as expected from the warnings on the menu. The pasta seemed a bit overdone but the shrimp was damn near perfect which well made up for it.  Wife had the Miso Salmon which was amazing and well done. The miso added a good amount of sweetness to the fish and I was pleasantly surprised that it was throughout the cut and not just on the surface. Shared the Macadamia nut-caramel and was pretty disappointed. The nuts were soggy and not flavorful at all. Caramel was like a sauce that was bland and again, lacked any real flair.

It was such a beautiful day, so outside in the patio area with the spot to be. My husband and I had our orders taken and or drinks brought out, but what made it even better was the busser. The food Runner he was constantly zooming by making sure that we were okay making sure that the area was clean and that we were being taken care of.  Even though he wasn't our server he was the person in our section. He was very attentive quick and seem like such a hard worker. My husband and I gave him a $10 tip just for being, so motivated this is what hard work looks like.

Kev O.,"Irvine, CA",32,389,860,4.0,6/21/2015,"Had actually planned on a more romantic restaurant with an ocean view on this date, but found that everything was fully booked for father's day weekend. So, it was a toss up between my date's suggestions of Denny's, IHOP, and Cheesecake Factory because it was less likely that these places would be fully booked.....I thought that perhaps my date was just testing me, so I chose the CF :)  I'd been to many other CF restaurants and knew they'd have an excellent selection of food choices on their menus....whether it's for the hungry or weight watchers. I'm glad I came here as the quality has always been consistent throughout all the CF's I'd been to so far.  Upon entering, it's pretty much the same decor and layout as any other CF. I guess I should have expected that even at 5.45pm this place was pretty full! However, when I went up to the hostess at the counter and inquired about the wait time, I was surprisingly told just 2 minutes! I then asked if it was the same for a booth? I was then told 15 minutes. Ok, not a problem as my date was still on her way anyway. I was given a buzzer which would go off when our table was ready,....and less than 3 minutes it goes off! That was fast!....and there was still a big crowd waiting around in the lobby area.  I love the free bread here, they're always so fresh and warm, and yummy with butter! But oh so easy to fill up on before your main meal comes! My date ordered the Chicken with Biscuits with Gravy.....the chicken usually comes sauteed, but she wanted them fried, which the waitress said was not a problem. I went ahead and ordered the combination dinner of Grilled Salmon, Chicken  Madeira which came with mashed potatoes and Asparagus spears. The portion of my dish was big, but her's was huge....and very delicious! Believe it or not I couldn't finish my chicken and mashed potatoes! She ended up having to doggie bag more than half her dinner. I have a feeling the bread and two apple martinis she had had filled her up :) Anyway, all in all it was a very good dinner and a pretty nice experience, although the place had now gotten completely packed and very noisy....yea, not the most romantic atmosphere for a date, but oh well :) After we finished dinner we then noticed how pleasant the weather was and how we probably should have sat at the outdoor patio, which was full too, but less noisy and much more airy. Oh, when I drove into this strip mall I was kind of fearing having to find parking as the lot was packed. Thank goodness that just beyond the Cheesecake Factory was a valet parking stand, and for just $5 you can save yourself some headache.....definitely worth it. Service here was good for how busy the place was....food consistently good quality....although I don't see my favorite Avocado Eggrolls on the menu anymore...that was a bummer :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=180

I was there just recently and it'll probably be my last time ever since I was disappointed on both occasions when I had came to this location. Sure, its a hit and miss.. but on both occasions... I think its a sign. I was a fan, but I think NOW its too over price for mediocre food or maybe I just started to notice it now.

And the fries were not super thin or really thick; it was just perfect with enough potato on it to make it a real french fry and not just dried crunchy sticks I recently had another eatery.   The place was very busy even for a mid-week evening. Of course, we couldn't leave without having some cheesecake.  We enjoyed some fresh strawberry cheesecake and oh, was it soo good.  It was just the perfect sweetness, not overpowering with sugar yet very sophisticated sweetness that you can taste off in the distance. I love the light and airiness of the whipped cream.  We were so stuffed but it was so good.  We were excited to bring home our leftovers so we can enjoy it for another meal.  You have to go..

There was a little bit of a wait, about 10 minutes, but it did not bother us since this gave us time to preview the glass case filled with tempting cheesecakes. Each more decadent than the one before, it seemed. Once seated, we were immediately greeted by our waiter, and drinks were on their way. We decided to go with just a salad the first trip since we wanted the cheesecake. The salad was amazing. I had the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and my friend has the smaller appetizer salad Factory Chopped Salad. Both were delicious and nothing was left shortly thereafter. Drinks were continuously being filled, but without that overbearing feeling of someone not in your party constantly at your table. (That is just a little creepy at times.) Desserts were, naturally, a couple of slices of cheesecake. The first night we went, we had a slice of Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake and a slice of Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Unbelievable. We had thought we had gone on to heaven. The second visit we decided to skip the salad and go straight to the desserts, so as to skip that feeling of someone rolling us out the door. We had a slice of Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake and a slice of Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake, This was unfathomable that these cheesecakes tasted better than the first trip. We just couldn't believe it. The pricing is a bit steep, and that would be my only negative if I had to give a negative point, but I believe for an amazing night out with great service, wonderful atmosphere, and amazing food, the price is worth it.

This appetizer, however, is $12.95. I get it--salmon is expensive. I wouldn't have ordered this if I didn't understand this concept. The problem was that it came with 4  pieces that were about the length and thickness of a mini Twix.  Really. Maybe about 2oz. of salmon in the whole thing. For $12.95?

Just no, Cheesecake factory.  You have GOT to be kidding yourselves.  I don't want to pick on this location because I know that's just a company standard, but it's a terrible one.  Don't get this when you could easily spend that much on a full lunch order--even one with seafood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=140

Bryan V.,"Laguna Beach, CA",337,72,114,5.0,6/28/2016,"I don't go to Cheesecake Factory often, but when I do, I always leave a satisfied guest. My last visit was probably the best experienced I had thus far. Good enough to actually make me Yelp about it.  I remember it was on a Saturday, June 18th, 2016 that my family, a party of twelve, came in to dine. I remember because it was my birthday, now you all know when my birthday is, so don't forget it! Anyways, Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations (at least for a party of twelve, they may for bigger parties), not the biggest fan of that, but none the less it is their policy, and I respect that. My girlfriend and I were the first ones to arrive and they quoted us 30 mins, that was totally fine because my family is always late anyways.  As we were waiting for the table, Chris, the manager, came and greeted us and assured us that if we need anything to please let him know and he would take care of it. From the moment I met Chris, I just picked up such a comforting and genuine vibe from him. As we were eating, there was a small hiccup with my food, and without saying anything he let me know that he issue was being taken care of and to not worry. He then let me know that the meal had been comped. Working in the restaurant industry, I've seen many management styles and felt like Chris' is outstanding. He did not need to do that but went out of his way to do so to satisfy the guest, and I loved the way he was so hands on and wasn't a back office manager. Long story short, I had a great time. I always get the Orange Chicken because of the perfect flavor, crisp and portion. Strongly recommend it! Also try the sweet corn tamales as an appetizer, you will not be disappointed. Chris, thank you again for a great experience.

I waited for the food to come out for another 20 minutes, then called again to say I was still waiting. The person on the phone said they forgot to tell someone to bring it out! When I initially called I let them know I would be paying with a card, well they came to my car without a swiper so they needed to bring  my card inside (which really doesn't seem right). They came back out and handed me the receipt.. exactly one hour after I placed my order! Feeling frustrated, I drove off only to realize they didn't give me my card back, so I had to turn around and call back to ask them to return my card. Once I returned home I was able to see that our food was now luke warm and had to put it in the microwave. They didn't even put bread in the bag with our meals. What a complete mess!! If it wasn't for the fact that I always have excellent service inside, I would not return to this location.

Jessica D.,"Irvine, CA",172,217,150,3.0,12/17/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite restaurants. So I was happy when we were told our company was having our Christmas lunch here. We sat outside in the patio it was a great seating area for a large group. However when it came to the service that was another story. Our orders were called in the day before due to the large quantity of people we had in our group. What a nightmare when it came to bringing out all of our orders. There was absolutely no structure what so ever when it came to bringing out everyone's order. They were all over the place. I get that we were a large group of people, but I just feel if you know you have that many people coming to your restaurant you need to have some type of system in place. It was just pure chaos. I felt we spent more time trying to get everyone their food on the table then getting to enjoy our meal. Plus some of my co workers mentioned their soups were cold. 3 star for their patio atmosphere and their cheesecake of course. I highly recommend their Adam peanut butter cheesecake. I had their Cobb salad it was pretty good, but I definitely would not recommend this place for a large group.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=260

Again, just okay. The tacos are crispy, while I prefer soft, and the black beans it comes with were undercooked. The tempura batter felt a little heavy and overpowered the fish. I appreciate that they have a light menu (skinnylicious) for those that are watching their weight/calorie intake.

This is my very first yelp review, that shows how disappointed I am. We come here all the time because we eat here before the movie we see at Bella Terra at least 3 times a month. We usually have Bre as our server and she is great! Tonight we had Britany and while she had a nice smile the experience was terrible. She clearly forgot to ring in our food as 30 minutes or more passed after we ordered and she never came by the table. While we were looking for someone to let them know we hadn't received our food a manager showed up. James was his name I believe. He smelled like a cigarette and while he was apologetic he didn't even know what we ordered. Once the food arrived no one came by to even quality check our food. The check was dropped and again no server for 15 minutes. Thank goodness we paid cash so we could leave to make our movie..

Mohib Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,363,3201,1.0,3/16/2013,"I came here on a Saturday night around 9:30 p.m., and to my surprise found seating within five minutes. This was by far the most impressive part of the night.  After being seated near a noisy bar, and noisy patrons, I found myself searching for a light to read my menu. This was downright ridiculous. The lighting in the restaurant was so dim that I could not see the menu, whether it was lighting from above or the candle at the table. After about 10 minutes of using my phone's light, I selected the mushroom burger. After flagging our waitress down, we finally ordered and waited another twenty minutes for the food to arrive. I couldn't say I was impressed by the service nor the people who were sitting next to us chatting away.  The mushroom burger was decent, but not outstanding. Taste did not stick out, nor did quantity. Instead, everything was noted to be fresh and filling, but rather bland and cold. I truly was not surprised at this point.  I realize that this was a poor choice in that I came on a busy night, where personal service could not really be guaranteed. Staff are being rushed and lean, and the pressure shouldn't be on them. It's a management issue, and surely the food could have more flavor. I just wanted a nice quiet dinner, and boy did I go to the wrong place for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=260

I came a second time and ordered the same thing hoping they had stepped up their game and they did. Not as salty anymore! So I'm pretty happy about that. I love me my meatloaf! :) .

Jr W.,"Orange, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/26/2017,"On June 23rd my family & myself decided to dine at one of your restaurant chains in Huntington beach because my girlfriend had received a gift card from one of her cousins a couple weeks prior as a birthday present because her cousin knows we tend to come dine at some of your restaurant locations at least a couple times a month because my family admires the great quality of food & service we always receive but sadly this was not one of those days. We can most of the time estimate how soon our appetizers & meals would come out especially if it's a packed house or not & we can understand when it's busy. But at 9pm to 11pm is not your peak hour on busyness tonight. Waiting over an hour for a Louisiana chicken pasta, bacon cheeseburger, kids quesadilla & chicken Madeira should not take that long to prepare. After paying for the bill I went up to the hostess desk to ask to speak the manager. Finally the manager who presented himself as Joe which Nicholas (the busboy) told me that was the manager he had told that i wanted to speak to him during our meal but never came after being told twice. I proceeded to let the manager know where I was sitting in the restaurant & that I seen him talking to the table next to us informing them of what I over heard him tell them apologizing on the food taking so long & he confirmed what I heard was true & that he said that. Then I told him that i asked Nicholas that I wanted to speak to a manager & he confirmed that Nicholas told him but Joe lost track of the time & after asking Nicholas a second time that I would like to speak to the manager he acknowledged that Nicholas told him again but then Joe said he looked at our table & seen our food was finally there so he figured the problem was solved without ever coming to talk to me & ask me what I needed. I then asked Joe why he never came by our table after being asked twice by Nicholas & he told me after the first time I asked to speak to him that he went up to our waitress Jenna & asked what I wanted to speak to him about but he said Jenna told him that we were just waiting on our food & wondering when it was coming out. I asked him why he did not come the 2nd time after asking for him & he said because he seen the food finally arrive on our table so he figured the problem was solved. I then asked him how he came to that assumption of why I wanted to speak to him because I never told Jenna or Nicholas that I wanted to speak to him on what was taking so long with our meals. I told him that i never even mentioned to Jenna our waitress that I wanted to speak him & that I only told Nicholas if he can ask the manager to come over. I then asked Joe if always puts his customers on hold or just ignores there request to speak with them without even knowing what they might need help with. He than apologized acknowledging he was wrong for not coming by after being requested twice & then I asked him why the food was taking so long today & that it was unacceptable for how long it took to get our meals when the restaurant was only half full at 10pm. He tried to tell me that the food was being prepared on time & when I brought up what he said to the customers who sat next to us & were seated after us that I over heard him apologizing about there food taking a long time that he would comp them salads & give more bread while they waited for there meals, he than agreed that he said that to them & apologized to me for our meals coming out so late. After hearing your manager Joe trying to lie to me & to keep getting caught in a lie & then apologizing to me after I keep bringing up the true facts, it's very upsetting to me that you would have a manager that has no respect for your customers & upon request to speak with him twice & Joe acknowledging that there seems to be a problem with the food taking longer than expected or a unhappy customer having terrible service, that he would just ignore them than instead try to figure out the problem & make both sides happy. I really hope you look into who you have in management in the future & that they get the right training to deal with their customers & not manage like Joe did tonight to ignore, lie & be comfortable w/ your customers leaving unhappy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=260

The max was 20 minutes for me and that was on a Sunday night.  Dishes: Ordered chicken carbonara for around $15. If you want to add chicken into the dish, you need to pay more. So technically, the dish is around $20 which is pricy considering that I can make this dish at home after eating it. Really, there's nothing special about it. BUT I do always like to order this dish when I'm here so i guess you can say I enjoyed it very much!  I also LOVEEEEE their original cheesecake! It is creamy with a perfect amount of cheese. Plus, it doesn't leave you that weird texture when they left it out for too long so the top layer becomes hard, if you know what I mean. Never tried the fish n chips but my bf always order that dish here!  As for the service, it's a hit or miss. One time, I went here with my friend and we needed forks for our pasta(they didn't give any utensils for us to eat) soooooo we waved down our waitress and she gave us the death stare like did we just really asked for her LOL other times, they were attentive to us.

I ordered the bacon-bacon cheeseburger and my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips dinner. We waited about 25-30 minutes for our food, which is ridiculous on its own, Especially because we were got there at 9:30, not at prime dinner hour. When my food came my burger looked semi appetizing, nothing mouth watering, and my boyfriends food was wrong. The waitress put in a fettuccini Alfredo instead of his fish and chip plate. They immediately took it back and told him that it would be out shortly. Which it did, BUT the fish was undercooked and mooshey. Just touching the fish with my fingers made me almost puke.. And by the time I got to eat my burger the bottom of the bun was soggy. I asked for ranch for and it took a good 10 minutes to finally get it. The waitress had no sense of urgency because her friends were at the table behind us. Long story short- I get better service at my favorite sports bar/pub on a Friday night then I do at this restaurant on a weekday 2 hours before closing.

When Bridgette L finally came over she told me that she had just heard about out service failure. That wasn't true. Based on Bridgette L's response, it speaks volumes about how they really feel about the customer. They don't care. I live in the same complex as ""The Cheesecake Factory"", Bella Terra. There are plenty of restaurants to visit and we won't be back. Our friends from Germany asked if this is the type of service they should expect from American Restaurants.

So my overall experience is based on how well they cooked my Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Ok, so I arrived here with my teenage son and two little girls. As we waited to be seated, we went next door to the Barnes and Nobles. We ended up missing the signal on the remote to come be seated. But, the host graciously got us another table within minutes. Unfortunately, it was in the bar area and the seating was kind of tight.  Our waitress was nice enough. Food came out within a reasonable amount of time.  THE TEST:   my pasta was alright. It was not the best Bistro Shrimp Pasta I've tasted. On a scale from 1 -10, I'll give it a 7.  We went home with slices of oreo Cheesecake and macadamia nut cheesecake. My son really enjoyed the Oreo. I can't give you a real assessment on mine because I ate it two days later and tasted kind of ""blah"". Probably should have eaten it that night.

Lena H.,"Long Beach, CA",896,233,1409,4.0,1/17/2015,"Oh the good ole Cheesecake Factory.  It's a wonderful choice when you don't have particular craving or when you have too many cravings.  This past Friday night (01/16/15) my husband and I could not come to an agreement on what we wanted to eat.  He had a craving for Mexican and I have not craving at all.  I did have an anti-craving....I knew I didn't want Mexican.  So after much deliberation and whining (yes I sometimes whine all women do) my husband finally acquiesced to my Cheesecake Factory suggestion. We went around 6pm on a Friday night.....big mistake! Parking was impossible, after driving in circles for about 30min we finally found a spot (go after 8pm crowds and parking lighten up).  We then checked in and were quoted a 35-minute wait (not too bad but it was a crowed night).  We told the hostess we'd take the first available table and were subsequently seated outside.  Now I get cold in 70-degree weather and I was expecting to suffer in silence but they had over hanging heaters, which kept me nice and toasty.   We decided to start dinner with a round of libations.  My husband ordered the gin & tonic and I order the traditional Mojito.  I'm not a fan of gin but I tasted my husband's drink, it was palatable.  Though I'm sure part of the reason is because they are rather light handed with the liquor.   My mojito was nice too, not overly minty though it could have used just a bit more lemon.  I much prefer mojitos from Bar Celona in Pasadena...does that place still exist??)  But, still good flavoring and very refreshing.  We then moved on to around of appetizers.  I had the beets & goat cheese salad, and my husband went with the Ahi Tartare.  I can't really opine on the tartare because my husband mixed in some wasabi.  He put a piece on my salad plate without me noticing and thinking that it was a piece of beet I ate it.  Being that I hate wasabi and it was the only thing I could taste, I can't honestly give an opinion.  My husband liked it though.   As for the beet & goat cheese salad, I would have loved if it were a full dinner sized plate.  It was delicious!  The beets were sweet and did not have an overwhelmingly earthy taste.  They were firm but not hard and beautifully mixed in with the tanginess of the vinaigrette, which complimented the sweetness just perfectly.  The greens just like the beets were fresh, crisp and nicely tossed in the vinaigrette.  The chunks of glazed pecans and goat cheese were a nice extra but I noticed myself eating the beets and greens together separate from the cheese & nuts.  According to the menu the salad also had pieces of apples, which quite honestly I've no recollection of.  I must have been completely entranced by the beets.  For our main course my husband went with the chicken picatta and I decided to be bad and go with the Americana burger.  The picatta is one of my husband's favorite dishes and Cheesecake Factory has never disappointed, today was no exception.  It was creamy, tangy and ""capery"".  Only issue if you could call it that, was that he does not like angel hair pasta and ordered linguine instead.  He did not realize that all the creamy and saucy goodness was under the pasta....he figured it out soon enough.  The burger was good, cooked perfectly medium and tender.  The only things I did not enjoy which were the selling points; were the potato crisps and grilled onions.  Combined the potato crisps and the grilled onions overpowered all the other flavors.  I think I will stick with the regular burger next time.   To end the night no trip to the Cheesecake Factory is complete without having a piece of cheesecake of course.  I don't have a sweet tooth, have never been much a of dessert person, and am easily warded off by a lot of sugar.  So, we always stick with the ""regular"" cheesecake.  It had been years since I had a slice and goodness I'd forgotten what I was missing out on.  They seriously make the best cheesecake in the world (at least in my world).  It's cool but not cold or frozen, smooth but not runny or mushy and sweet but now drowning in sugar/sweetener.  Absolutely delicious!!! What else is left to say??? The service you ask....great as always!  I've never had any negative interactions/contacts with the servers.  In my experiences they've always been friendly and attentive, it was no different this time around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=220

Jeff K.,"San Clemente, CA",482,248,621,3.0,1/25/2016,"We've been to many Cheesecake Factory locations over the years and I have to say, the last couple times the HB location hasn't been up to par compared to others. LOCATION and AMBIANCE (Rating 3.75) As usual the decor and ambiance is spot on for ""Cheesecake factory. They really do a good job in that regard. It's not quiet and seating is close on long rows of table dining, but overall it's done well. We went last night (Saturday at 6pm) and I expected a wait. Surprisingly, we were seated right away (party of 4). That may speak to my report of of the food quality slipping. SERVICE (Rating 3.5) Our server last night was nice enough, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, but he seemed to have a few too many tables as his attention span was short and visits infrequent.  SPICY CASHEW CHICKEN (Rating 3) This is my ""Go-To"" over the years. It's a spicy Mandarin-style dish with green onions and roasted cashews over rice. It typically is very good, but tonight.. not so much!. Very dry and the chicken quality and taste just so-so. I was disappointed. CAROLINA BBQ PORK SANDWICH (Rating 2.5) This sandwich sounded great, and it would have been if the meat was of better quality and not so tough. It said it was ""Tender"" pulled pork (barely could bite through it as it was so dry and overcooked). The applewood smoked bacon was good along with the coleslaw and grilled bun.

Erin N.,"Las Vegas, NV",1593,435,2521,4.0,12/10/2013,"Cheesecake Factory-- the best place to go if you can't decide on what you feel like eating.  Seriously, the Factory has so many choices on their menu. From pasta to sandwiches, to shepards pie to BBQ chicken pizza, to carb conscious healthy options to a California omelette; there is something for everyone. Their menu is more like a novel with at least twelve pages of food options to please everybody at the table. As if it wasn't already hard enough to make a decision on what to eat, there are also pages of advertisement in the menu. With my short attention span and the ridiculous length of the menu, our server always has to come back like three times before I know what I want to order. Yeah, I'm THAT person. Embarrassing! Just don't forget to bring your reading glasses to dinner-- the lighting is dim in the restaurant and you have some serious homework to do. Here's a list of my favs: - Huevos Rancheros: SO simple, yet my favorite breakfast option here. Crispy quesadilla, cheese, black beans, eggs and salsa is a perfect combination and they do it so well here. - Everything Pizza: Sausage, pepperoni, olives, and more on a perfectly baked crust. Nom! - Seared Tuna Tataki Salad: Healthy and delish! Seared Tuna on a delicious bed of greens. My go to salad when I want something light, yet filling.  Oh, and I should mention servings are HUGE. Sharing a salad or an entree is probably a smart idea! Plus, you know-- gotta leave room for dessert. After all, this is the Cheesecake Factory we are talking about here.  FYI: Lunch specials are also offered before 4pm. Sunday Brunch is also offered until 2pm.   I have been to plenty of Cheesecake Factories but this location is probably my favorite. I like the layout of the restaurant and the outside patio area, not to mention the service here is always excellent. There is also valet for a few dollars, which comes in handy as Bella Terra is always busy on the weekends and the parking structure is quite a walk away.  Cheesecake MUSTS: - Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake! My absolute favorite! - Smore's Cheesecake-- so so SO decadent. Must share with at least three people or your face will fall off from the richness of this cheesecake. - Banana Cream Cheesecake! if you love the pie you will love this cheesecake.  - Red Velvet Cheesecake! This is such the perfect combination, you can't go wrong with this one.  But seriously though, how this place always gets me to order cheesecake for dessert, despite being ridiculously full is beyond me. I have no self control when it comes to cheesecake, or yummy food in general. I see myself wearing a lot of stretchy pants in the future. #noshameinmycheesecakegame",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=220

Diana B.,"Orange County, CA",636,241,561,4.0,3/26/2015,"NO RESERVATIONS!! this can be a little frightening especially on a friday night. Ambience: cheesecake factory is known for their dark atmosphere and waiters/waitresses dressed in all white. There is outside seating with heat lamps that offer a little more light, but is still relatively dim compared to other restaurants. This location always seems to be buzzing with people no matter what time of day you go. Menu: the menu can be extremely confusing, with ads on some pages, long lists of food on others. You don't know whether you should be looking under the ""specials"" or under the individually categorized entree (meat, pasta, lunch, etc). It is definitely a very hefty menu, almost 30 pages long!! and with the bad lighting, how can anyone really see? Food: I always opt for the brown bread, and I only asked the waitress to bring brown bread, which she does without fail. The bread has a slight hint of sweet and is just delicious overall. We decided on the Salmon Genovese, which, to my surprise, was absolutely delicious!! The large piece of crisped salmon was placed over pasta balls (looked like rice) with a pesto sauce and sundried tomatoes. OH MY GOSH. I did not expect this dish to be this delicious. The combination of the crispy salmon and the sundried tomatoes is to die for. There are nuts in this dish, which I will ask them to not add next time, but YES, delicious!! Dessert: this two-page menu has such a long list of cheesecakes. How will you know which to choose?? I usually opt for the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries, but this time, we got the Godiva Chocolate and the Banana Cream Cheesecake. The banana was my favorite because it wasn't too sweet, and it came with fresh banana slices. The Godiva was a little sweet in my opinion. Service: it was a busy night but i think our waitress did her best to make it to our table whenever she could.

Tram N.,"Westminster, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/30/2017,"Have always loved the Cheesecake Factory, had many birthdays, great celebrations there. We frequent this location at least a couple times a month but this last time we went, we ordered a spaghetti and meatballs from the kid's menu for our son and barely through a few bites discovered a piece of plastic wrap in it. Brought it to the attention of the server and he asked if we would like it replaced. Since it was for my 2 year old son and he had barely taken a few bites I said please. The manager on duty came to our table and explained that it may have been the plastic from the cheese they have. We got the check and saw that they had put ""free/comped meal"" on it however, they had charged us for TWO spaghettis and counted the replacement as ""free"". A little misleading considering we didn't really receive any free nor comped meal because we still ended up having to pay for it. This made me remembered that the same thing had happened to us one prior time here with a piece of wax paper from their butter and the manager at the time had actually brought me a new one AND comped us for it. I don't mind paying for the food obviously since we came here to eat, just would like for my child's food to NOT include plastic in it. Don'r mislead people by labeling on the check as ""free/comped meal"" when in reality we didn't get anything for free. Just disappointing since we come here so often and have always loved the Cheesecake Factory but this just left an unpleasant taste for me and I Probably will try another location for our family meals in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=240

But this past Wednesday we asked Gina (the employee that seats you) for a booth after being offered the small tables by the bar along the small wall, I wanted to enjoy dinner and chatting with my daughter as we were celebrating Mothers Day and those small tables are very awkward as they seat you near strangers. Gina looked bothered immediately, then we walked back, I saw her walk towards the host, but never saw If they engaged in a convo, Gina came back to me and said it would be 5 minutes.  After several small parties were seated while we waited and then finally the waiting area went empty. I asked the hostess when our table would be ready and she stated that she didn't even have our name down. During that time Gina would just walk by us and look at us.

Gerry B.,"Orange County, CA",74,218,6473,4.0,11/24/2013,"Several (8) friends and I were looking for a late (10:30p.m.) dessert place after our birthday celebration dinner for one of our friends.  We decided on The Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach.  Parking was readily accessible,  seating was immediate, and the service was good at this time of night.   I convinced my friend to share the new cheesecake of the month, S'mores Cheesecake, with me.  It is a Hershey Cheesecake on a graham cracker crust with a top layer of  chocolate ganache.  This creation is topped with oozing, fluffy, white marshmallow with an embedded graham cracker square on the top  center of the slice.  It is accompanied  with the usual whipped cream on the top end and bottom end of the cheesecake.   I took my first bite.  All is could do is go hmmmmmmmm, as it swirls and melts in my mouth. I was too busy enjoying the taste to join in the table conversations.  My other friend, who has the same love for decadence and  shared the cheesecake, rolled their eyes to the back of their head for this guilty pleasure. It  was is amazing and left me speechless for a while. My friends and I enjoyed every minute spending time, catching up, and savoring this sweet course. A memory we will remember for a meal we have shared. It was a great way to end the night; sweet in more ways than one. Tip: I highly recommend for large birthday parties to have their celebrations late at night.  It is easier to get seating for large groups and you get better service. Also, I hope they will include an option for extra graham crackers squares for the cheesecake, which gives it that s'mores feel. Lastly, let your server know the name of the person with a birthday so that they can write their name in chocolate on the plate when their cheesecake is served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=240

I had my first Cheesecake Factory experience yesterday and it exceeded my expectations. I was looking forward for some lettuce wraps, but unfortunately they were all sold out. So I decided to get the chicken samosas and it was probably one of the best decisions I've made this year. The samosas were perfectly crunchy on the outside and perfectly seasoned on the inside. My entree plate, chicken Carbonara, was a perfect amount and satisfied my week long craving for pasta. The only con would be the plastic beer mugs.

Bobby B.,"Laguna Beach, CA",22,9,5,1.0,10/24/2015,"Well..... The bar seems to fail once again. Every time I've been here over the last two years, the bartender(s) have been extremely difficult to pull away from their own gossip column conversations, stocking a fridge or making a drink.  As it just took 22 minutes to get anyone's attention, it was a busser, who I caught during her run to get me a plate after my food was delivered.  32 minutes to get salt and pepper...... A couple sat down next to me and after 15 minutes, I saw them still waiting patiently so I flagged down someone who could take their order....  As an FYI, there were only three people at the bar. Obviously, they were training a blind girl who was only stocking beer as a slave to the main barkeep who was stuck in the server well. As I continue to come here, I continue to expect and have horrible service.... I would love it if anyone of a mgmt position would care snout to oversee anything in this place. The couple next to me just shouted out to the back of the bartender, as they were ignored, may we please have some salt and pepper. She asks me if I need anything as she is in front of me and I reply with, ""nope, just please pay attention to others"". Albeit, I had already paid my tab, she responded with, ""there are only a few people at the bar""... Their bar service is simply and absolutely pathetic.  FYI, this review only reflects the bartenders and does not reflect the servers at individual tables.

Tiffany T.,"Long Beach, CA",10,10,26,2.0,2/21/2015,"A friend of mine talked up The Cheesecake Factory quite a bit. She frequents the Marina Del Rey location because she lives in L.A., but I'm in Long Beach closer to Orange County so I went to the location in Huntington Beach. Maybe this is the kind of chain where the quality fluctuates depending on the location but I was not impressed with the Huntington Beach location.  The restaurant is located in an outdoor shopping mall and it was a Saturday so of course parking sucked. They do have valet available for $5 which is a reasonable price, but I was with my sister and she refuses to pay for parking so we drove around until we found a space.  We arrived at about 3pm so there was no wait. When I first walked in I immediately thought of the theme restaurants in Vegas hotels. That isn't necessarily a bad thing although I'm not sure what theme The Cheesecake Factory is going for. The decor seems like they can't decide between Egyptian, Mayan, or Mardi Gras. It was a little disconcerting. The hostess was pleasant and the booth was spacious. Our waiter, Patrick, was also very nice, but one of the spoons in my sisters set up was dirty so we had to get a new one. It's worth mentioning, at least to me, that the booth lights look like the eye of Sauron, I kid you not!! I wish I'd taken a picture. My sister and I got full course meals, appetizers, entrée, and dessert. For appetizers we got the crab cake bites and the fried mac & cheese. I enjoyed my crab cake bites and I even liked the sauce that came with it. It was a tartar sauce with a hint of mustard. It sounds weird, but it was actually tasty. My sister didn't like her fried mac & cheese. I tasted it and it was ok, but not enjoyable. They do get points for giving her four good sized mac & cheese balls that can be easily shared between two or more people.  For entrées we ordered the margarita pizza and the chicken romano. My sister didn't like that they sprinkled Parmesan on the pizza. She said it was too salty. She also said she'd never had a margarita pizza without actual tomatoes. She said the pizza was edible but not good. I tasted it and agreed with her. My chicken romano was completely underwhelming. They put too much egg in the bread crumb coating to the point where that was all you could taste. Also, I understand that good pasta should be cooked al dente but my pasta was undercooked. It was also supposed to be tossed in a light tomato sauce but the sauce was heavy and full of Parmesan. I like Parmesan but they seem to put it in EVERYTHING.  We ordered cheesecake, the fresh strawberry for my sister and the key lime for me. They drowned both slices in whipped cream which wasn't necessary. The key lime was tangy and not too sweet like it should be, but for a place named The Cheesecake Factory, I didn't feel like it was a cheesecake I couldn't get at any other bakery/resturant like Polly's or Marie Calendars. My sister also felt that they went overboard with the glaze on the strawberries.  All of this amounted to an $85 dollar check which included an $11 cocktail. I probably should have been suspicious of the cocktails when I saw that there were no prices on the cocktail menu.  Overall verdict: underwhelming and over priced! As my sister said, you're basically paying for The Cheesecake Factory name, not for quality food. I must mention that the service we received was excellent which is the only reason this location gets two stars.  Although I haven't written off The Cheesecake Factory altogether (maybe the other locations are better), I'm not going to go out of my way to visit this location and I won't recommend it to friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=280

Sweetaspie B.,"Lynwood, CA",60,71,12,1.0,4/4/2016,"Run Away! Not for large groups or anyone wishing to be treated with common decency!! I wish that I could give this place a negative star!!! Please see below for my review and complaint that I left on the Cheesecake Factory's website! Shame on you Rob Cowle!! On Saturday April 2nd, after about 2 months of planning, my family attended a Group movie night with about 120 of friends and family and children from our Christian congregation. My dear friend Selena P. is an event planner in the Los Angeles area who frequently organizes weddings and other events. She is absolutely professional and meticulous in everything that she does. Prior to the event she let us know that she had made arrangements for us to have dinner together after the movies at your restaurant. I personally love Cheesecake Factory and was thrilled to hear that we would all have dinner together there. Unfortunately, when our large party arrived after the movies we were told that the manager onsite ROB COWLE would not honor the arrangements that our event planner had made with CHRIS WOOD. He was extremely rude to her while she tried to explain to him the prior arrangement. He would not even allow her to speak to Chris Wood who had been so kind in previously setting up the arrangement. As our large party (over 100 patrons) waited out front she tried to reasons with Mr. Cowle to accommodate us. He refused to do so or offer any other suggestion. He did not even apologize for not honoring her reservations. Selena did everything right. She visited the restaurant earlier in the week. She even provided pictures of the space days earlier after confirming with management. I arrived early to the theater and personally witnessed her go to your restaurant to reconfirm the reservation hours before our expected arrival time. I am the last one to ever complain about racism. However, I have never seen someone treated with such blatant disrespect. I could not help but ask myself whether or not the fact that we were predominantly African-American in a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood had anything to do with the way Mr. Cowle was treating us. I have never been treated so horribly in my life, especially not by an establishment based in customer service. To see my friend brought to tears broke my heart and I am appalled at the way she was spoken to and treated. I can assure you that all of the other food establishments in the Bella Terra mall were thrilled that your company turned us away because we visited about 3 other restaurants who treated us with the respect that our patronage deserved. The only color that should have mattered in this situation was green. At least human decency and an apology were owed but Mr. Cowle had none of those for us. If Cheesecake Factory is in the habit of mistreating groups of paying customers then it is no longer a place that I care to visit!! Another Cheesecake Factory has opened in Santa Monica near my job and I have already vetoed anyone from my pharmaceutical company to have lunch or dinner meetings there. I was planning to patron the new restaurant in Cerritos also but I have a bad taste in my mouth from this experience...one that not even your Cheesecake can remove. I hope that your establishment can make things right as I don't believe that you are in the business of mistreating paying customers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=280

I guess it's the closest to us and the wait isn't half as bad as the one in Disneyland, but I guess I shall try to break it down to some key memories here. (I've only checked in twice, but I've come here a lot more times than that...) 1) This memory sticks out to me like a sore thumb because it's my go to story for one of my worst experiences. I ordered a steak medium rare (like always), Cheesecake Factory is fairly dim, so it's hard to see things sometimes, but when I got the steak my friend and I noted that it was more blood rare (for those of you who don't know, it's basically a piece of steak that's flashed on a grill for marks, but the inside is completely rare. This is typically only ordered from high end steak places where their quality of meat is off the charts, since this is a dangerously easy to get sick. Anyways, I ramble,) I told the server (who was terribly difficult to flag down, despite the slow day) he went to get it changed, then somehow did a 180, came back and informed my friend and I that this was in fact medium rare, I may want to reconsider ordering well done next time. Honestly, it took every fiber of my being to not throw the plate at him. I literally opened my phone and googled steak cooking temperature and had to show him what medium rare is really like. Honestly, I wasn't even mean when I asked him to cook it more, I promise.  2) Went with some friends, and the server was upbeat and so nice. This is the quality I look for and anticipate here. I forgot her name, but she made me realize this placce was still worth going to.  3) The cheesecake, every time, without fail is great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=280

When I arrived BEFORE the movie I confirmed again with CHRIS that 100 people will be coming directly after the movie and requested again the patio and he welcomed me with open arms ensuring me that he would stop seating in the patio around 7:00pm so as to get ready for our large party!  Everything went south when I arrived to see the patio still full of people and another manager by the name of ROB COWLE when he decided that he would NOT HONOR the agreement I had with Chris!

I had to wait another 10 min. The manager was not concerned at all about my steak being made wrong. She did not return. This was very rude and bad management. I will not eat at this location anymore, I am very upset.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=460

Hugh A.,"Whittier, CA",124,252,66,5.0,3/16/2014,The Five Stars come from the restaurant's willingness to put bold dishes with flavor on the menu. On the brunch menu is a selection with classic Southwest style. Their Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas is a worthwhile walk on the wild side. It's like an omelet and nachos mixed together. Roasted Poblano peppers and tomatillo-chile sauce turn up the tasty meter.

Shannon F.,"Yorba Linda, CA",149,96,48,1.0,1/22/2015,"I placed an order for pick up about a month ago for a group of employees** at work.  First, when I called in the order, no one answered.  I called back and was put on hold for over 10 minutes.  Finally I placed the order.   I was disappointed when I arrived and there were people parked in the 'curbside delivery' spaces for Cheesecake factory but were not waiting in their cars.  After search for parking, I had to park in a neighboring restaurants 'curbside' spot which I felt incredibly guilty about.  I called the number for curbside delivery and was put on hold.  I waited 10 minutes, then hung up and called back.  They answered and I explained that I had to park in the other restaurants spot and gave my car's make and model.  They said they'd be out.  When the server arrived with the food, I had been sitting in the parking lot approximately 20 minutes.  In fact, it was 20 minutes AFTER my food was scheduled to be done according to the order.  I paid and was given my food, and I hurridly drove back to the office where I knew hungry employees were waiting.  When I got there, we discovered that the order was wrong- one of the pasta dishes was missing a main component (Shrimp!) and was plain.  My employee was disappointed but did not want to call since it had been such an ordeal.  We decided we will order from somewhere else next time. **On a side note, I have contacted their corporate regarding a food allergy and asking for guidance on what would be safe to eat, and they basically told me that their ingredients are proprietary information and they refused to help me.  So when I ordered for my employees, I was forced to order for myself at a different restaurant who was able to provide ingredients and guidance for my allergies.  Judging from both experiences, it seems Cheesecake Factory is not a service oriented business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=460

I've asked for it to be cooked in medium, it was burnt on one side and pretty much well done. We informed the server, C, she's beautiful but responded as in she didn't care. She just said she'll spread the word and walked to a different table.  Initially this review was 3-4 stars but after the food and service we received towards the end of the night I totally lost it.

Marwan K.,"Costa Mesa, United States",42,44,142,3.0,11/8/2017,"My girlfriend and I have decided to review restaurants based on five criteria: Food, Alcohol, Cleanliness & Ambiance, Service and Value/Price We came to Cheesecake Factory at Bella Terra for my girlfriend's dad's birthday.  FOOD My girlfriend and I shared the Jambalaya and it was pretty good.  The chicken was seasons well.  My girlfriends parents had the Grilled Fresh Salmon with a side of Shrimp and the Seared Ahi Tuna with a side of shrimp.   They both enjoyed their meals especially the shrimp.  However, the sides weren't the best.  We did not have cheesecake for desert, we were full.  Overall the food was decent for what it was and although the rest of the experience was not good, we give the food 3/4 of a star.  ALCOHOL I had a Whiskey Smash and my girlfriend had a Well Mannered Martini.  My Whisky Smash was a tad sweet but over all really good.  They pour generously here so that is a plus.  The Well Mannered Martini was good and you couldn't taste the blue cheese olives in the drink.  Overall the drinks are 3/4 of a star.  CLEANLINESS & AMBIANCE  The restaurant and bathroom are relatively clean for the foot traffic Cheesecake Factory has which tends to be a lot on a Saturday.  The ambiance is also a little loud for my taste but it is a chain and that is part of the experience.  Overall the cleanliness & ambiance gets one star.  SERVICE The service was horrific.  Our waiter Nathan G did not seem like he wanted to serve the table at all.  When he did come to the table to take the orders and my girlfriend was translating what she was ordering for her parents he got annoyed because they changed their minds one time.  Also he never let us know how late the appetizer was going to be.  It eventually came out after the meals so we sent it back.  Finally he didn't come by once to ask how we were or if we wanted desert.  We have had a string of good service so we were due, but this was bad.  Overall the service deserves zero stars a complete disappointment.  VALUE/PRICE The restaurant is a good value we spent $111 on three meals and three drinks without tip.  Obviously the tip was not very good on this night.   Overall the value/price receives 3/4 of a star.  In conclusion the restaurant is 3.25 stars.  I really wanted to give it closer to 2 stars but it did check off the necessary boxes I suppose.  I definitely won't be back for a meal here again unless someone specifically requests it for a birthday.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=40

I wish I had more, but I'm glad I didn't because the entree portions are HUGE. Passionfruit and Blueberry Mojito: Good! Refreshing.

Sauce in this was very different. It wasn't sweet like the one on my plate. It went really well with the steak. I didn't try any of the other dishes, but I feel like Cheesecake Factory has a lot of really delicious foods! Salted Caramel Cheesecake: Good!

Jennifer T.,"Westminster, United States",47,16,119,4.0,25/7/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a very affordable, high quality restaurant. Food + Service = :) INSIDE: The restaurant allows you to choose to sit inside and outside. I have sat at both during dinner hours. If you are seated outside, it is a very calm and relaxing area even if there are cars around. Not loud at all, and they put out fire stand thingys (what are the called omg??) when it gets cold. Inside, you'll sit at a table or booth. Very clean and spacious.  SERVICE: Each time I go, servers will usually leave their shift and another server will substitute in. I love how nice and informative they are when they switch off their shifts. I get to meet my new server and things go on as if it didn't happen. One thing I love about this restaurant is how it ALWAYS refills my water even if I've sipped on it twice. It's the little things that matter. During all my visits at Cheesecake Factory, I have only gotten my order wrong once. My waiter will correct it, and my replacement comes about 5-10 minutes later which is fine with me. (I had ordered the Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls, but I received some Skinnylicious salmon dish).  THE FOOD: I love the menu selection at Cheesecake Factory. It includes anything you can think of. I love their fries and will order it despite what kind of dish I'm ordering! However, I docked one star off this review because their Cuban Sandwich. This sandwich came off as very, very greasy. It tasted pretty bad, and I felt like it was something made to be microwaved and was heated with a grill instead. It was a mess eating it. I love all the pastas here, but just that sandwich makes me feel a little sick.  THE CHEESECAKE: Oh I always gain a million pounds after leaving this place anyways, so I obviously order the cheesecakes here! I am a sucker for Red Velvet Cheesecake, and I would eat all of the cheesecakes on the menu if I could in one sitting. It's classic and the price is unbeatable.

There have been 2 occasions out of 5-6 where the food took over an hour to come out, and the drinks we ordered almost just as long. It would've been understandable if it were busy, but it wasn't at all. We had to follow up 3 times with our waitress before what I assumed was the manager came out to personally apologize and deliver our food.  FOOD It's Cheesecake Factory - portions are generous (sometimes), food is food, and great selection for a casual dinner. WAITING Comparing it to my go-to Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach, the lines are pretty much nonexistent.  In the end, it's a decent location but when compared with the Redondo Beach location, service doesn't compare. They have more efficient staff with (what seems like) more genuine enthusiasm for their work, which for me always leads to bigger tips and more satisfaction.  I would've given it a 5/5 if it weren't for the 2 occasions of extremely poor service and failure to make up for their error from management. It varied too much to give it any higher than a 3/5. If you're looking for great service for a group of family or friends, I'd try another restaurant.

Got all over my suit, shirt, and folder (suit and shirt will have to be cleaned).  Only had white napkins and trying to wipe off Diet Coke on a black shirt with a white napkin didn't go so well.  So we moved to another table and continued with our meal and discussion. Paid the bill and left; there were five of us.  After, we were talking outside and just realized, we didn't get a manager apology, nothing off the check, no offer of free dessert...NOTHING!!!  Just the bill.  I was not expecting anything for free but I think a manager apology would be in order.  Very disappointing.

Today was my son's birthday and the tradition continues for birthday dinner and some cheesecakes at Cheesecake Factory. We were greeted by a very cocky server and he stayed that way for the entire meal.  I don't know what we did wrong except maybe for the fact that we were Asian?  I just felt He was prejudiced because he seemed better at the other tables. Me, my wife, my 14yr son and 12yr son all felt the same about his attitude so it had to be him right?  And we don't normally complain about bad services but today we left this establishment with a very sour feeling.   And yeah my son didn't want any cheesecakes for dessert either.  He asked if he can get dessert somewhere else and wanted to leave as quickly as possible. Will never comeback to this establishment again.  Even the food seemed very off today too.  How can it be godd when you have a sour mouth.

This place closes at 12:00 pm...We all know the cheesecake here is to die for but I have to tell you the filet minion steak here is simply the best in Orange Country! They tell me most folks don't order it and order mosly pasta dishes at this restaurant but if you are like me and need a perfect steak now and again oder this baby! It's very large...thick..and juicy! It comes with mashed patatos and veggie. I ask them to add mushroom gravy to the mashed and it is yummy! Also start with a cup of potato soup...to die for when you dip their crusty white bread in it. Of course finish off with a slice of cheescake and coffee and then you can roll out of there...The steak is about $30.00 but worth every bit of it.

The downside here is that they don't take reservations on a weekend night so you have to physically come in to put your name down. Every time I come, there is always a wait. I am a total bread and butter lover so the best part about this restaurant is that they bring you this to start off with while looking at the menu! The brown bread that they serve is so good! I think it's rye bread but I call it ""chocolate bread"" because that's what it looks like hahah. The servers are always nice about it when I ask for more:) I love the pastas here! I ordered the pasta da vinci dish which was delicious. If you love mushrooms, this is the plate to choose! It comes with a mushroom wine sauce. My friend ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. It comes with bow tied pastas topped with a white sauce and sun-dried tomatoes. This was heavy but really good!

Parking close will never happen, unless its your lucky day! So, save yourself the trouble and park far away and walk. I have been eating at Cheesecake factories in So Cal well before any Social media existed. I have been to this location in Huntington Beach  multiple times to celebrate Birthdays and just because type of meals for parties of 2-4 people. It has always been a go to place since its such a crowd pleaser. Buuuuuuuuut  each visit here in HB has always been a different experience. Some good, some not so good. A few times our order was mutilated, forgotten, or completely jacked up. Some visits our service were spot on and a perfect experience. I have eaten inside, outside and at the bar. In my opinion the bar is the fastest and easiest place to eat.  Today I felt service was decent, but rushed.  Service has never been consistent here,  which is why the 3 stars. Good servive to me, makes it or breaks it.  Service is really hit or miss depending on the time. The wait is anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. After placing your name, take the buzzer and wait. They seem to want to seat you, and quickly get your order in and send you on your way. I understand, they are busy and need to move the show along to serve people in a timely matter, but I ALWAYS feel rushed here. Helllllllooo....their menu is like a novel. I do require more than 5 minutes to know what I want.  Food is great here. I gravitate towards their salads that are way to big, burgers, Philly and the cashew chicken. All of them are great. Especially paired with the loaf bread they bring out. They have something for everyone here. I mean everyone from Carnivores to Vegetarians, that takes them on a trip around the world with their diverse cuisine. Their menu is endless. They even have skinny portions, just in case your counting calories. If your not counting calories their desert menu is amazing, offering any kind of cheesecake, some chocolate cake, ice cream, ect.  Drink wise, refillable Coke products, iced teas, strawberry lemonade are all perfect to wash down a delicious meal. If your into wine and bear they have that too. There is also Expresso drinks, which I am not a fan of. They are not as strong as I like them. Lunch for 4 was about $100. Luckily, Daddy BigBucks usually pays for us, especially since we were celebrating my Birthday today!!! 3 star service....4 star food.

On our way out I spoke to the Manager who apologized by saying 'rubber bands are on our produce'. That's not okay. They shouldn't be in our food.

When your server doesn't come by for refills, or to check how your food is, is just not great customer service either.  I had to ask some bus boy to bring more refills, and to bring the bill back to us, since it was already 45 minutes past since we finished our food, waiting for the bill. Another time, our waiter didn't check up on us, was in the worst mood possible, and also, when we said we didn't want our food boxed, he brought us someone else's food from a different table all boxed up! literally I think this has ruined my experiences with this place, and that's sad because it's always been one of my favorites.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=100

He got a large pasta plate, it looked good and he said he loved it! It was all well worth it. In addition, we got one slice of cheesecake. It was the raspberry , lemon flavor. It was the best! 2 meals, 2 alcoholic drinks, and 1 slice of cheesecake was $72 + a tip. So it was a bit pricey, but definitely worth it for a date night.

During our 2 hours there our sections waiters switched out 3 times and our serves were never the same. We ordered a couple appetizers and entrees. The appetizers were fried and hard to mess up. They came out hot. My wife ordered chicken and biscuits, I ordered steak Diane. Her chicken and biscuits looked like it sat under a heat lamp all day. It was tuff, rubbery, the biscuits were tough and sad looking. She could've got better chicken and biscuits at Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). My Steak Diane did not look like Steak Diane.

So my overall experience is based on how well they cooked my Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Ok, so I arrived here with my teenage son and two little girls. As we waited to be seated, we went next door to the Barnes and Nobles. We ended up missing the signal on the remote to come be seated. But, the host graciously got us another table within minutes. Unfortunately, it was in the bar area and the seating was kind of tight.  Our waitress was nice enough. Food came out within a reasonable amount of time.  THE TEST:   my pasta was alright. It was not the best Bistro Shrimp Pasta I've tasted. On a scale from 1 -10, I'll give it a 7.  We went home with slices of oreo Cheesecake and macadamia nut cheesecake. My son really enjoyed the Oreo. I can't give you a real assessment on mine because I ate it two days later and tasted kind of ""blah"". Probably should have eaten it that night.

Lena H.,"Long Beach, United States",896,233,1409,4.0,17/1/2015,"Oh the good ole Cheesecake Factory.  It's a wonderful choice when you don't have particular craving or when you have too many cravings.  This past Friday night (01/16/15) my husband and I could not come to an agreement on what we wanted to eat.  He had a craving for Mexican and I have not craving at all.  I did have an anti-craving....I knew I didn't want Mexican.  So after much deliberation and whining (yes I sometimes whine all women do) my husband finally acquiesced to my Cheesecake Factory suggestion. We went around 6pm on a Friday night.....big mistake! Parking was impossible, after driving in circles for about 30min we finally found a spot (go after 8pm crowds and parking lighten up).  We then checked in and were quoted a 35-minute wait (not too bad but it was a crowed night).  We told the hostess we'd take the first available table and were subsequently seated outside.  Now I get cold in 70-degree weather and I was expecting to suffer in silence but they had over hanging heaters, which kept me nice and toasty.   We decided to start dinner with a round of libations.  My husband ordered the gin & tonic and I order the traditional Mojito.  I'm not a fan of gin but I tasted my husband's drink, it was palatable.  Though I'm sure part of the reason is because they are rather light handed with the liquor.   My mojito was nice too, not overly minty though it could have used just a bit more lemon.  I much prefer mojitos from Bar Celona in Pasadena...does that place still exist??)  But, still good flavoring and very refreshing.  We then moved on to around of appetizers.  I had the beets & goat cheese salad, and my husband went with the Ahi Tartare.  I can't really opine on the tartare because my husband mixed in some wasabi.  He put a piece on my salad plate without me noticing and thinking that it was a piece of beet I ate it.  Being that I hate wasabi and it was the only thing I could taste, I can't honestly give an opinion.  My husband liked it though.   As for the beet & goat cheese salad, I would have loved if it were a full dinner sized plate.  It was delicious!  The beets were sweet and did not have an overwhelmingly earthy taste.  They were firm but not hard and beautifully mixed in with the tanginess of the vinaigrette, which complimented the sweetness just perfectly.  The greens just like the beets were fresh, crisp and nicely tossed in the vinaigrette.  The chunks of glazed pecans and goat cheese were a nice extra but I noticed myself eating the beets and greens together separate from the cheese & nuts.  According to the menu the salad also had pieces of apples, which quite honestly I've no recollection of.  I must have been completely entranced by the beets.  For our main course my husband went with the chicken picatta and I decided to be bad and go with the Americana burger.  The picatta is one of my husband's favorite dishes and Cheesecake Factory has never disappointed, today was no exception.  It was creamy, tangy and ""capery"".  Only issue if you could call it that, was that he does not like angel hair pasta and ordered linguine instead.  He did not realize that all the creamy and saucy goodness was under the pasta....he figured it out soon enough.  The burger was good, cooked perfectly medium and tender.  The only things I did not enjoy which were the selling points; were the potato crisps and grilled onions.  Combined the potato crisps and the grilled onions overpowered all the other flavors.  I think I will stick with the regular burger next time.   To end the night no trip to the Cheesecake Factory is complete without having a piece of cheesecake of course.  I don't have a sweet tooth, have never been much a of dessert person, and am easily warded off by a lot of sugar.  So, we always stick with the ""regular"" cheesecake.  It had been years since I had a slice and goodness I'd forgotten what I was missing out on.  They seriously make the best cheesecake in the world (at least in my world).  It's cool but not cold or frozen, smooth but not runny or mushy and sweet but now drowning in sugar/sweetener.  Absolutely delicious!!! What else is left to say??? The service you ask....great as always!  I've never had any negative interactions/contacts with the servers.  In my experiences they've always been friendly and attentive, it was no different this time around.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=220

Jeff K.,"San Clemente, United States",482,248,621,3.0,25/1/2016,"We've been to many Cheesecake Factory locations over the years and I have to say, the last couple times the HB location hasn't been up to par compared to others. LOCATION and AMBIANCE (Rating 3.75) As usual the decor and ambiance is spot on for ""Cheesecake factory. They really do a good job in that regard. It's not quiet and seating is close on long rows of table dining, but overall it's done well. We went last night (Saturday at 6pm) and I expected a wait. Surprisingly, we were seated right away (party of 4). That may speak to my report of of the food quality slipping. SERVICE (Rating 3.5) Our server last night was nice enough, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, but he seemed to have a few too many tables as his attention span was short and visits infrequent.  SPICY CASHEW CHICKEN (Rating 3) This is my ""Go-To"" over the years. It's a spicy Mandarin-style dish with green onions and roasted cashews over rice. It typically is very good, but tonight.. not so much!. Very dry and the chicken quality and taste just so-so. I was disappointed. CAROLINA BBQ PORK SANDWICH (Rating 2.5) This sandwich sounded great, and it would have been if the meat was of better quality and not so tough. It said it was ""Tender"" pulled pork (barely could bite through it as it was so dry and overcooked). The applewood smoked bacon was good along with the coleslaw and grilled bun.

Erin N.,"Las Vegas, United States",1593,435,2521,4.0,10/12/2013,"Cheesecake Factory-- the best place to go if you can't decide on what you feel like eating.  Seriously, the Factory has so many choices on their menu. From pasta to sandwiches, to shepards pie to BBQ chicken pizza, to carb conscious healthy options to a California omelette; there is something for everyone. Their menu is more like a novel with at least twelve pages of food options to please everybody at the table. As if it wasn't already hard enough to make a decision on what to eat, there are also pages of advertisement in the menu. With my short attention span and the ridiculous length of the menu, our server always has to come back like three times before I know what I want to order. Yeah, I'm THAT person. Embarrassing! Just don't forget to bring your reading glasses to dinner-- the lighting is dim in the restaurant and you have some serious homework to do. Here's a list of my favs: - Huevos Rancheros: SO simple, yet my favorite breakfast option here. Crispy quesadilla, cheese, black beans, eggs and salsa is a perfect combination and they do it so well here. - Everything Pizza: Sausage, pepperoni, olives, and more on a perfectly baked crust. Nom! - Seared Tuna Tataki Salad: Healthy and delish! Seared Tuna on a delicious bed of greens. My go to salad when I want something light, yet filling.  Oh, and I should mention servings are HUGE. Sharing a salad or an entree is probably a smart idea! Plus, you know-- gotta leave room for dessert. After all, this is the Cheesecake Factory we are talking about here.  FYI: Lunch specials are also offered before 4pm. Sunday Brunch is also offered until 2pm.   I have been to plenty of Cheesecake Factories but this location is probably my favorite. I like the layout of the restaurant and the outside patio area, not to mention the service here is always excellent. There is also valet for a few dollars, which comes in handy as Bella Terra is always busy on the weekends and the parking structure is quite a walk away.  Cheesecake MUSTS: - Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake! My absolute favorite! - Smore's Cheesecake-- so so SO decadent. Must share with at least three people or your face will fall off from the richness of this cheesecake. - Banana Cream Cheesecake! if you love the pie you will love this cheesecake.  - Red Velvet Cheesecake! This is such the perfect combination, you can't go wrong with this one.  But seriously though, how this place always gets me to order cheesecake for dessert, despite being ridiculously full is beyond me. I have no self control when it comes to cheesecake, or yummy food in general. I see myself wearing a lot of stretchy pants in the future. #noshameinmycheesecakegame",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=220

I ordered the bacon-bacon cheeseburger and my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips dinner. We waited about 25-30 minutes for our food, which is ridiculous on its own, Especially because we were got there at 9:30, not at prime dinner hour. When my food came my burger looked semi appetizing, nothing mouth watering, and my boyfriends food was wrong. The waitress put in a fettuccini Alfredo instead of his fish and chip plate. They immediately took it back and told him that it would be out shortly. Which it did, BUT the fish was undercooked and mooshey. Just touching the fish with my fingers made me almost puke.. And by the time I got to eat my burger the bottom of the bun was soggy. I asked for ranch for and it took a good 10 minutes to finally get it. The waitress had no sense of urgency because her friends were at the table behind us.

zheng y.,"Los Angeles, United States",1,136,4,1.0,25/4/2016,"Had two bad experiences here over the past month.  A friend and I live about 50 miles apart, so it is convenient to meet in the middle at Bella Terra. We tire of the noise at Islands and the menu at Romano's, so we tried Cheesecake Factory for variety. Two weeks ago, I ordered salmon rolls, and our male server, whose name I don't recall entered the order as shrimp rolls. Not being familiar with the CF menu, I began eating the rolls, only to find no salmon inside. Waiter was called, and he apologized and re-entered the correct order. By the time the salmon rolls came, my friend had finished his lunch, so the mis-order and poor timing made our lunch very unsatisfying. They made no effort to offer us any sort of compensation for the error, and we didn't ask, so we just chalked one up to poor service and bad attitude. This weekend, my friend, who enjoys CF more than I, suggested it again and I acceded. We got there at opening at 11, so it wasn't too busy yet. I ordered an omelette which was to include avocado, cheese and bacon. When the food came out, I began eating, and once again, after 4 of 5 minutes and a half dozen bites into the omelette, I realized no avocado had been included, called our server Marisa over, and returned it for correction. After a normal wait, the correct plate was served, but once again the timing of our meals was disrupted and Marisa was not genuinely a good server, not very attentive, and offered no form of compensation for the kitchen's error. In light of two similar experiences, with in one case a server's error and in one a kitchen error, I can only assume management does not encourage the servers to offer any discounts or desserts to compensate for such terrible service. These service errors must be a way of life there, so don't expect anyone to care if your meal is not right.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=300

Pete S.,"Cypress, United States",473,1401,1557,4.0,17/5/2014,"Oh Cheesecake Factory, how my wide waist loves you. Not only do you offer one of the best cheesecakes around, you also make choosing dinner an incredible difficult task with your brochure like menu that is forever changing.  But what's great about you guys is that you have high employee morale and low turnover and considered Fortune top 100 companies to work for. Good for existing employees, not so good for people getting in.  I won't waste your time with mumbo jumbo what food to eat here. (except that I love the raspberry truffle cheesecake and someone should fire whoever took away the Thai Chicken pasta off the menu) Instead, you should know: Buying gift cards towards the end of the year. They will give out a certificate for a free cheesecake for every $25 gift card purchased. Last year, they offered 2 cheesecakes for each $25. My fat ass thanks you. I was lucky enough to get the ""golden ticket"" receipt that was worth $10 once. It's a survey for exchange for $10 GC.  They do have happy hour from M-F I believe 4-6 here. Certain appetizers are $5.  They have lunch portions that are good until 5pm. Cheaper fare. Some of the pastas I usually get are only $12.  Parking here in this location is incredibly difficult, you can call into go and there are 3 togo short term parking spots here. Oh why the 4 stars? Well, it's more like 4.5 but I think Cheesecake lost some of the glamour for me as the dining ""experience"" but I applaud you for consistency like Mikadees. Oh, on a closing note, Sunday brunch here including their lemon pancakes here are excellent.

Tiffany T.,"Long Beach, United States",10,10,26,2.0,21/2/2015,"A friend of mine talked up The Cheesecake Factory quite a bit. She frequents the Marina Del Rey location because she lives in L.A., but I'm in Long Beach closer to Orange County so I went to the location in Huntington Beach. Maybe this is the kind of chain where the quality fluctuates depending on the location but I was not impressed with the Huntington Beach location.  The restaurant is located in an outdoor shopping mall and it was a Saturday so of course parking sucked. They do have valet available for $5 which is a reasonable price, but I was with my sister and she refuses to pay for parking so we drove around until we found a space.  We arrived at about 3pm so there was no wait. When I first walked in I immediately thought of the theme restaurants in Vegas hotels. That isn't necessarily a bad thing although I'm not sure what theme The Cheesecake Factory is going for. The decor seems like they can't decide between Egyptian, Mayan, or Mardi Gras. It was a little disconcerting. The hostess was pleasant and the booth was spacious. Our waiter, Patrick, was also very nice, but one of the spoons in my sisters set up was dirty so we had to get a new one. It's worth mentioning, at least to me, that the booth lights look like the eye of Sauron, I kid you not!! I wish I'd taken a picture. My sister and I got full course meals, appetizers, entrée, and dessert. For appetizers we got the crab cake bites and the fried mac & cheese. I enjoyed my crab cake bites and I even liked the sauce that came with it. It was a tartar sauce with a hint of mustard. It sounds weird, but it was actually tasty. My sister didn't like her fried mac & cheese. I tasted it and it was ok, but not enjoyable. They do get points for giving her four good sized mac & cheese balls that can be easily shared between two or more people.  For entrées we ordered the margarita pizza and the chicken romano. My sister didn't like that they sprinkled Parmesan on the pizza. She said it was too salty. She also said she'd never had a margarita pizza without actual tomatoes. She said the pizza was edible but not good. I tasted it and agreed with her. My chicken romano was completely underwhelming. They put too much egg in the bread crumb coating to the point where that was all you could taste. Also, I understand that good pasta should be cooked al dente but my pasta was undercooked. It was also supposed to be tossed in a light tomato sauce but the sauce was heavy and full of Parmesan. I like Parmesan but they seem to put it in EVERYTHING.  We ordered cheesecake, the fresh strawberry for my sister and the key lime for me. They drowned both slices in whipped cream which wasn't necessary. The key lime was tangy and not too sweet like it should be, but for a place named The Cheesecake Factory, I didn't feel like it was a cheesecake I couldn't get at any other bakery/resturant like Polly's or Marie Calendars. My sister also felt that they went overboard with the glaze on the strawberries.  All of this amounted to an $85 dollar check which included an $11 cocktail. I probably should have been suspicious of the cocktails when I saw that there were no prices on the cocktail menu.  Overall verdict: underwhelming and over priced! As my sister said, you're basically paying for The Cheesecake Factory name, not for quality food. I must mention that the service we received was excellent which is the only reason this location gets two stars.  Although I haven't written off The Cheesecake Factory altogether (maybe the other locations are better), I'm not going to go out of my way to visit this location and I won't recommend it to friends.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=280

Sweetaspie B.,"Lynwood, United States",60,71,12,1.0,4/4/2016,"Run Away! Not for large groups or anyone wishing to be treated with common decency!! I wish that I could give this place a negative star!!! Please see below for my review and complaint that I left on the Cheesecake Factory's website! Shame on you Rob Cowle!! On Saturday April 2nd, after about 2 months of planning, my family attended a Group movie night with about 120 of friends and family and children from our Christian congregation. My dear friend Selena P. is an event planner in the Los Angeles area who frequently organizes weddings and other events. She is absolutely professional and meticulous in everything that she does. Prior to the event she let us know that she had made arrangements for us to have dinner together after the movies at your restaurant. I personally love Cheesecake Factory and was thrilled to hear that we would all have dinner together there. Unfortunately, when our large party arrived after the movies we were told that the manager onsite ROB COWLE would not honor the arrangements that our event planner had made with CHRIS WOOD. He was extremely rude to her while she tried to explain to him the prior arrangement. He would not even allow her to speak to Chris Wood who had been so kind in previously setting up the arrangement. As our large party (over 100 patrons) waited out front she tried to reasons with Mr. Cowle to accommodate us. He refused to do so or offer any other suggestion. He did not even apologize for not honoring her reservations. Selena did everything right. She visited the restaurant earlier in the week. She even provided pictures of the space days earlier after confirming with management. I arrived early to the theater and personally witnessed her go to your restaurant to reconfirm the reservation hours before our expected arrival time. I am the last one to ever complain about racism. However, I have never seen someone treated with such blatant disrespect. I could not help but ask myself whether or not the fact that we were predominantly African-American in a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood had anything to do with the way Mr. Cowle was treating us. I have never been treated so horribly in my life, especially not by an establishment based in customer service. To see my friend brought to tears broke my heart and I am appalled at the way she was spoken to and treated. I can assure you that all of the other food establishments in the Bella Terra mall were thrilled that your company turned us away because we visited about 3 other restaurants who treated us with the respect that our patronage deserved. The only color that should have mattered in this situation was green. At least human decency and an apology were owed but Mr. Cowle had none of those for us. If Cheesecake Factory is in the habit of mistreating groups of paying customers then it is no longer a place that I care to visit!! Another Cheesecake Factory has opened in Santa Monica near my job and I have already vetoed anyone from my pharmaceutical company to have lunch or dinner meetings there. I was planning to patron the new restaurant in Cerritos also but I have a bad taste in my mouth from this experience...one that not even your Cheesecake can remove. I hope that your establishment can make things right as I don't believe that you are in the business of mistreating paying customers!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=280

Jackiee H.,"Santa Ana, United States",221,96,68,3.0,26/5/2016,"This is usually a go to spot with my best friend because we are able to share a meal (literally) and get scrumptious cheesecake to ourselves, but there are times that I come here that I seriously reconsider do we ever want to go back? I guess it's the closest to us and the wait isn't half as bad as the one in Disneyland, but I guess I shall try to break it down to some key memories here. (I've only checked in twice, but I've come here a lot more times than that...) 1) This memory sticks out to me like a sore thumb because it's my go to story for one of my worst experiences. I ordered a steak medium rare (like always), Cheesecake Factory is fairly dim, so it's hard to see things sometimes, but when I got the steak my friend and I noted that it was more blood rare (for those of you who don't know, it's basically a piece of steak that's flashed on a grill for marks, but the inside is completely rare. This is typically only ordered from high end steak places where their quality of meat is off the charts, since this is a dangerously easy to get sick. Anyways, I ramble,) I told the server (who was terribly difficult to flag down, despite the slow day) he went to get it changed, then somehow did a 180, came back and informed my friend and I that this was in fact medium rare, I may want to reconsider ordering well done next time. Honestly, it took every fiber of my being to not throw the plate at him. I literally opened my phone and googled steak cooking temperature and had to show him what medium rare is really like. Honestly, I wasn't even mean when I asked him to cook it more, I promise.  2) Went with some friends, and the server was upbeat and so nice. This is the quality I look for and anticipate here. I forgot her name, but she made me realize this placce was still worth going to.  3) The cheesecake, every time, without fail is great.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=280

Selena P.,"Lynwood, United States",71,4,7,1.0,3/4/2016,Just so everyone knows personally I was really hurt because I have never felt the blatant discrimination I felt yesterday (Saturday 4/2/16) and I have worked with so many different people (different races) in my line of business over the years...and for this to be 2016! I don't know why but I was just shocked!*** I came down during the week on (Tuesday 3/29/16) and spoke to a really nice manager I told him that I had a 100 of my close friends coming to the movies - Superman vs Batman and afterwards we would be coming to his restaurant for dinner- his name is CHRIS WOOD he was very welcoming an had every intention to accommodate us!  When I arrived BEFORE the movie I confirmed again with CHRIS that 100 people will be coming directly after the movie and requested again the patio and he welcomed me with open arms ensuring me that he would stop seating in the patio around 7:00pm so as to get ready for our large party!  Everything went south when I arrived to see the patio still full of people and another manager by the name of ROB COWLE when he decided that he would NOT HONOR the agreement I had with Chris! He wouldn't even let me speak to him. He informed me that he made the final decision not to accomodate our group. I understand completely the policy that they don't take reservations but I came in early said I had 100 people for the patio...spoke with a manager...he verbally agreed. What else could I have done?  ROB COWLE did NOTHING to accommodate us....!!!  Rob Cowle needs to know that outright discrimation is not tolerated and hopefully the corporate office will do what they have to and get rid of people like that in their company.

Tonight I ordered it from door dash so I could enjoy it at home. I didn't mind that after fees and a 20% tip for the driver I paid about 12 dollars extra for the convenience but I regret doing so. I anticipated that it wouldn't be AS good as at the restaurant but it was a pretty bad experience. I received the food without any napkins or silverware, which was unexpected but obviously I could fix that problem. The steak was cooked properly and had good flavor but there wasn't any tempura asparagus, which was really disappointing. There was a very small amount of sprouts and the other vegetables to top it all off, next time I want to eat at home I will be sure to go somewhere else.

Jonathan N.,"Los Angeles, United States",1190,365,367,3.0,3/8/2013,"Usually I'd expect The Cheesecake Factory to be super packed. Well my visit went along with my expectations but surprisingly, my party of 12 were seated within half an hour which was pleasant. We got our drink orders maybe 10 minutes after sitting. The bad part was that it took them 20 minutes to send over somebody to take our orders. Just because we're a big party and we're instantly charged gratuity no matter what doesn't mean they can take their sweet time to deliver subpar service.  I'd imagine a reasonable wait because any real restaurant would attempt to send over the entire table top at the same time. The only problem with that is that a member of my party actually ended up getting served the wrong food and the waitress was insistent that that was what she ordered. I didn't know vegetarians ordered some kind of chicken sandwich. My friend must have been mistaken because she looked like she definitely ordered that and was obviously confused. However, I was lucky enough to get the dish that I ordered. I had the sheppard's pie and although I had an image in my head of what it would look like (and it came out looking different from most traditional servings of it), the taste was fairly on point. Nice mashed potatoes, good amount of vegetables that weren't cooked to kingdom come, the beef wasn't anything special, but overall, comfort food done alright. Just an average experience. Nothing too special. Nothing too terrible besides the neglect of service.

As if I hadn't had enough pasta I decided on more pasta for my entree.  However this dish was loaded with asparagus, peas, bell peppers and tomatoes all tossed with really tender chicken and a chipotle cream sauce.  I don't know how it works, but it works.  I ordered a lunch portion and I still couldn't get half way through it so they are really generous.   My boyfriend had the Steak Diane which was pretty good as well  The sauce alone was really nice.  The steak was cooked so nicely, which I like to point out because corporate places get that wrong more often than not.   Everything was good, above average for sure BUT  there are still many places I would rather head back to before this.  They are A Ok in my book in a good way.  I'd go 3.5 for sure.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=380

It was back when I was still working in Newport Beach, so we would always go to the one in Fashion Island. I had a $25 giftcard so I figured, why not? The hubby and I loaded the kids and off we went. The HB location is closer to home. We didn't have to wait at all, 2pm on a Friday afternoon. Yeah, late lunch.

He was super friendly and checked on us just enough, not too little and not a lot. Refilled our drinks without us even having to ask. Definitely on his A game.  We ordered the chicken tenders w fries (kinda dry) and mac n cheese (really gourmet, yum!) for the kids. We started with the ahi tuna tartare and endive salad. I enjoyed both a lot. For our entrees, the hubby had the SkinnyLicious turkey & avocado sandwich w a clam chowder and I had the SkinnyLicious chicken salad sandwich w a caesar (shoulda substituted w a soup instead). Both our sandwiches were meh but the soup was really flavorful. My caesar was a little overkill since we shared the endive salad already.

They are way overpriced and don't seem to care about the quality of the food or the waitstaff being friendly and accommodating.

AJ C.,"Santa Ana, United States",60,89,9,5.0,6/2/2016,"My girlfriend and I came here on Wednesday night for dinner. She received a gift card to the Cheesecake Factory for Christmas. So we decided to come for dinner. We ordered the egg roll sampler, my girlfriend ordered the lemon herb chicken and I ordered the Italian sandwich. The egg rolls pretty good although my favorite out of the platter would be the southwestern egg rolls (a must try). Our entrées came next. The sandwich was big and delicious I ordered it with a salad. But the salad seemed as if I was dressed early and sitting in a bowl. It was soggy and wilted when it came out to our table. The chicken was juicy and moist. But overly salty. We immediately told our server and sent her manager to our table with the complaint for her dish. He apologized for the over seasoned food and took the chicken off from our bill. Service 5/5 Hospitality 5/5 Food 4.5/5",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=340

One, their bread is amazing and usually comes out nice and warm. Their brown bread is soo good, I crave it all the time. I don't know what they put in it, but I can never stop eating it. Two, their Louisiana pasta is amazing...I love the cajun sauce with the bowtie pasta. It comes with crispy chicken, and is to die for.  Three, Their cheesecake is good, decadent and rich. I like their white chocolate chip macadamia nut and pumpkin.  Four, the ambience is intimate  and dimly lit. Their wait is usually not that long.

Amaya S.,"Redlands, United States",787,486,855,3.0,21/5/2012,"3 1/2 Stars! Let me explain why I didn't give this Location a 4 star review.... because I really did enjoy myself.  Its mainly because of the location and the lack of view.  Sorry to be so picky.  But its in a crowded shopping center, nothing to special about that.... Parking is a madhouse here so be ready. Either park in the garage that is 2 city blocks away (not really, but it helps my story), or patrol the lot with force.   As with any Cheesecake Factory is decorated nice and everyone is nice.  I've been to quite a few CFs and have never had a bad experience.  My waitress was very hospitable and kind which makes their push to sell cheesecake at the end palpable.  Funny I'm always to full for the cheesecake. I started off with a Blueberry Mojito.  YUM. I'm a girl who loves a good mojito, hell I love a bad mojito too as long as it has liquor.  This one was sweet and tart with a minty after taste. And I was slightly buzzed.  I ordered the Bleu Cheese BLT with Fries.  Delicious.  While I hate Bleu Cheese Dressing I LOVE the crumbles, weird.  The burger was cooked perfectly to a medium rare and the bacon was crispy.  The fries were seasoned well, especially with my side of ranch.  Whatever you do DON'T order the Mac and Cheese Burger..... mid-way through I got so depressed that I was eating a Burger topped with Fried Mac and Cheese, seriously. Nice place for lunch, but a date..... drive to the Newport Location.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=340

I would have liked a bit more rice and beans in the chili, but there was LOADS of chicken and it's very savory.  The Tuscan Chicken is served with balsamic vinegarette and has asparagus and grape tomatoes.aplenty. Both dishes were excellent. There was a funny lack of communication about the cheesecake.  My wife sez she wants Key Lime and waiter asks if she wants to split it.  She says, ""No, I want the whole thing"".  Apparently he thinks she means a whole cheesecake b/c he says, ""You can't cut it for about an hour and a half.  It's deep-frozen.""  It took a minute or two to get that straightened out, and I had some kind of totally obscene chocolate cake, of which I could only eat half, so I had the other half for breakfast.

Emily F.,"Redding, United States",0,4,,1.0,30/12/2016,"My boyfriend and I are Cheesecake Factory regulars - often coming more than once a week, and always spending plenty of money each time as we always order drinks, appetizers, meals and dessert. The food is always excellent. However, the service we received by Breeann P is why we will never be back to this location. She never greeted us, only said ""what would you like to drink?"" She never offered us bread so we had to specifically request it when she came to take our order. She never visited our table, and when she did she always had other table's dirty dishes and hardly said a word to us. (Mind you this whole time we have been nothing but patient and kind to her, just slightly baffled at how inattentive she has been compared to how the service at Cheesecake Factory usually is). My boyfriend and I both waited over 15 minutes for a drink refill. When we got our food, she did not check up on us at all. We managed to flag her down for the bill, and when she asked us if we would like it to be boxed, we said yes. Then she proceeded to ask us to HAND HER THE PLATES even though she was standing right in front of our table. Because of the lack of service, we hadn't eaten much between the time our food was brought out and when we wanted to leave, so I had to pick up my multiple and heavy plates, still full of food, to hand her across the table - absolutely unprofessional.

It took 20 minutes to get our cocktails- I had walked to the restroom and myself being a bartender knew what to look for as I passed the bar and noticed our drinks sitting there. Our food was quite slow to hit the table, and I am not sure if it was our server's first busy patio shift, but the pre-bussing, bussing, and check presentation took way too long.  The food was in large and delicious portions when it did arrive and the patio atmosphere was gorgeous and inviting on this scorching heat wave.

I mean congrats babe?  Anyways, after a quick 10 minute wait (Thursday night), we got our booth for 4.  The service here is always very nice, but also consistently slow.  For example, our water would always check in with us every time he walked by, but when we asked for more bread, it wasn't at our table for another 10 mintues.  I think the servers there are maybe a bit understaffed because they always seem to be rushing somewhere to help with another table.   Drinks: I'm the only table alcoholic, so I was the only one to order a drink.  I got a Hendricks Tonic w/ Lime and Cucumber and I gotta say they have pretty heavy pours here.  definitely not complaining though haha. Food: I'm actually not a really big fan of their food here.  We always seem to get calamari for the app and without fail, each time we order it, it gets smaller and smaller!  Last night's calamari was a plate with a napkin folded in half on it, with the actual calamari only put on top of that half napkin... it was honestly only good for 1 person's worth of food.  For entrees, my lady for some unbeknownst reason, swears by their chicken fettecini alfredo with sun dried tomatoes.  I guess she really loves bland sauce tossed with store bought (my guess) pasta and a couple of sun dried tomatoes thrown on top... but who knows?  maybe I'm the one with a terrible palate.  I ordered the chicken little - fried chicken breast strips with mash and veggies.  Let me clarify, this plate isn't bad, but also isn't great.  I only got it because I remembered it was huge - and this time was no exception.  After getting some sriracha (obviously), I devoured the plate and was definitely full. Dessert: Our awesome waiter came up to us towards the end of our meal and apologized for the slow service.  To make up for it, he actually threw in a free slice of cheesecake!  *CUE heavens opening up and harp music. We let him surprise us with his favorite underrated slice and a minute later he showed up with a S'Mores Cheesecake slice.  I was a bit skeptical, but after my first bite, SOLD!  The S'mores CC is amazing here.  It comes with a golden brown marhmellow melted over a rich creamy chocolate cheesecake, topped with whipped cream.  I don't think I wouldve been able to finish it by myself, so sharing was perfect for us 4.

Jason C.,"Huntington Beach, United States",63,44,80,3.0,12/10/2014,"The service was good, but the food sucked. I  ordered fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp. It was extremely bland. Not worth the $50 for food and two beers.  What also sucked is that they don't put a minimum temperature on the heaters for the outside heating.

Ariana S.,"Long Beach, United States",0,2,,2.0,16/10/2014,"Came in on Monday evening around 9pm with my partner on a date.  Let me start by saying the server was really nice, the timing of the food was perfect, and the food itself was delicious.  However, when we got there and asked for a table outside, the host said no. As I have worked in the restaurant industry for ten years (until last week :D ), I understand about sections closing, etc. However, what is the point of closing a desirable outside patio section at 9pm when you don't close the restaurant for another two hours and I could see several tables out there eating their dinners on the walk up. Be accommodating! That's your job. Besides, we would have tipped well. At the end of our meal, we had only eaten half of the food because it was a lot (we had each ordered combination plates). The server took it to box it up, and did not return for a while. When she did, it was to inform us that ""someone accidentally threw it away and the kitchen is cooking new food"" for us. No worries! We thought, well now we will have extra food, which is always cool. We got desert and eventually she delivered three boxes in a bag which was our replacement to go food.  When we got home and looked inside, there were no mashed potatoes at all, despite the fact that there had been A LOT of the tasty potatoes left originally. Also, there was a very small amount of steak in one box, which we had each left half of on our plates. The chicken and salmon were fine. I just don't understand why, after paying 90$ for our meal and tipping 20%, this was acceptable. I don't know if it was the servers memory, the kitchen manager being cheap, or just people not caring.  At any rate, we probably won't go back. I'm sure they can be good and it was just a fluke, but when you are spending over 100$ on a meal, ""somebody"" should not throw your food away and ""somebody"" should not forget to replace it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=360
Em H.,"Garden Grove, United States",16,91,153,1.0,10/5/2015,"I have been to this location probably 3 times, and tonight was the fourth and need to write a review about this. My first time was years ago with my ex and I was young didn't know much about food. Came here 2 time with my bf and my taste bud has changed over the years. I DIDNT like what I ordered. I came here third times with my parents and my kid...my experience and taste bud still has not changed one bit. We waited over an hour for a frozen cheesecake, was not fresh when order so we cancelled.  Let's make the story short. I had GNO tonight and one of my girlfriend wants to come here because she craved for Hibachi steak. I have told them how I dislike this place and food are so terrible. They convinced me and I decided to give another try.  My experience tonight: order mojito during happy hour. The drink contains mild of alcohol and too much ice. (No wonder it's on happy hour menu)  Calamari: the only dish that we finished and taste good. The bad thing about this there were 2 popcorn chicken in our calamari. The manager came to our table informed us one of the plate gonna take another 10 minute because they have to change season. Told her there were chicken in our calamari, her respond? ""Oh, I'm sorry. Let me check in the kitchen and make sure it won't happen again.""  I order Diane steak, well done (can't stand pink...weh weh) first of all, most of my pieces are burnt, therefore, I cut off most of the layers. Mash potatoes cold outside but warm inside. Very odd...usually a well prepared food from a fine restaurant should be hot....not under room temperature to cold. Even my mushroom was cold, not warm but cold. Overall, I would definitely not coming back. Everyone have a different opinions about Cheesecake Factory, but mine I regret and waste my money tonight. I should have convince my friends and try Z'tejas, food would have been better.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=360
Rob R.,"Boise, United States",1,218,5,4.0,10/5/2015,"Always a good choice when you're hungry and can't decide what to at. The menu is extensive. In most cases, too many choices equals mediocre fare. The Cheesecake Factory does everything well.  When it's busy, it can take awhile to be seated and served. Food orders can also drag. Fortunately, they bring drinks and warm bread out quickly.  I've tried pasta dishes, burgers, chicken dishes, Asian influenced dishes and have never been disappointed. And then there is the cheesecake. Oh boy! Every bite screams calories, but how can something that tastes sooooooo gooooood be so bad for you. Do yourself a fave and take a slice home if you're too full.

Might as well go to California Pizza Kitchen across the parking lot. But the chicken madeira and herb-crusted salmon plate (served with a mound of mashed potatoes) was delicious.

Shannon F.,"Yorba Linda, United States",149,96,48,1.0,22/1/2015,"I placed an order for pick up about a month ago for a group of employees** at work.  First, when I called in the order, no one answered.  I called back and was put on hold for over 10 minutes.  Finally I placed the order.   I was disappointed when I arrived and there were people parked in the 'curbside delivery' spaces for Cheesecake factory but were not waiting in their cars.  After search for parking, I had to park in a neighboring restaurants 'curbside' spot which I felt incredibly guilty about.  I called the number for curbside delivery and was put on hold.  I waited 10 minutes, then hung up and called back.  They answered and I explained that I had to park in the other restaurants spot and gave my car's make and model.  They said they'd be out.  When the server arrived with the food, I had been sitting in the parking lot approximately 20 minutes.  In fact, it was 20 minutes AFTER my food was scheduled to be done according to the order.  I paid and was given my food, and I hurridly drove back to the office where I knew hungry employees were waiting.  When I got there, we discovered that the order was wrong- one of the pasta dishes was missing a main component (Shrimp!) and was plain.  My employee was disappointed but did not want to call since it had been such an ordeal.  We decided we will order from somewhere else next time. **On a side note, I have contacted their corporate regarding a food allergy and asking for guidance on what would be safe to eat, and they basically told me that their ingredients are proprietary information and they refused to help me.  So when I ordered for my employees, I was forced to order for myself at a different restaurant who was able to provide ingredients and guidance for my allergies.  Judging from both experiences, it seems Cheesecake Factory is not a service oriented business.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=460

Tiffany L.,"Westminster, United States",5,25,35,5.0,7/8/2015,"My boyfriend and I came here twice, once for Valentine's Day and a second time for my 21st birthday. For Valentine's Day, I think we waited about an hour and a half to be seated. They were really crowded that night, but that's understandable. The second time, which was on a Thursday night, we only had to wait about 15 minutes. When we got seated, we found that it was very dim inside, so it was hard to see. It also took a long time for the food to come out. They basically have everything on their menu. They have a great selection of food -- burgers, pasta, salad, etc. Before we ordered, we got different types of bread and butter. The whole wheat bread is SO good. Their bread is unlimited too so you can ask them for more! When it was time to order, my boyfriend and I went for their pasta. He ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta and he loved it! I hate mushrooms but I also liked what I tasted of his pasta. It had a nice creamy flavor to it. His chicken was also tasty. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle chicken pasta and thought it was super delicious! It's now my favorite pasta -- it has the perfect hint of spice and the perfect crunch, since they top it off with bits of tortilla chips (I think).  Their cheesecake slice is really big... I totally underestimated it. We ordered the Oreo cheesecake to share but it got soo sweet that we couldn't finish it. It was good but I probably wouldn't order it next time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=440

Their gigantic menu has pretty much everything. I do like the Gumbo and Cajun Pasta. Its a commercialized version of what the real stuff  tastes like but hey, compared to the rest of the menu there's actually some spice and semblance of flavor that rises above the masses-will-eat kind of bland. Now the good stuff: wheat bread?  Whatever the darker bread they start you off with. It's bomb. Ask for more. The cheesecakes. Omg love. It's not frou frou fancy gourmet dessert but damn it's good. Rich and ridiculously fattening. Everything a guilty dessert is suppose to be. The Godiva is a must for chocolate lovers and the S'mores cheesecake is just as amazing as it sounds.

As I was walking to our table, I noticed there were plenty of vacant tables. Ok... so we got to our table and it was set for 6 people, when there were other 2 seater tables. Whatever, the extra space was nice. But, our table and my utensils were dirty, there were crumbs of food and stains. I would normally go ballistic, but I didnt complain.. Our server forgot to give us or completely disregarded straws in our drinks and gave us a rude expression when we asked for it. Our food was standard cheesecake quality.

I had ordered the chicken bellagio which is a pesto pasta with arugula and a breaded chicken breast. The pasta was angel hair which I am not a fan of but everything else was good.

She made sure we were happy with our food, made sure we weren't full, made sure if we had room for desserts and checked up on my friend and I constantly.

I felt it was important to report it to the manager, because that is a serious health issue. She told ME she would make an emergency call, but insisted that large cockroaches come from or side AND that the ones that you need to concern yourself with are the ones that are smaller. I told her, unfortunately this one was a smaller one and came directly out of the kitchen around the window that they have up on the booth. Our waiter even confirmed my fears and killed it for us!!!

Did you think I wouldn't notice? A few years ago, what used to be a 7 inch-long, 3 inch-wide at the base wonderslice that satisfied my craving like no other cheesecake, has now become...much less. So very much less, indeed.. About half the volume, I'd say.  Or maybe, you thought that pathetic dollop of whipped cream lying there like an after thought would fool me into believing that a five inch slice was filling up the takeout container? Baby, I remember a few years ago when you'd send me home with a whole separate bowl's worth of topping goodness. That's the kind of love it used to take to match a Cheesecake Factory slice. Alas, no longer... Scoundrel! Why do restaurants feel the need to cheat their faithful customers? Are there none left who won't stoop to ""downsizing"" their portions while keeping the same prices?  At least Fresh N Easy still appreciates me. There, I can get an 8 inch ROUND cheesecake for the same cost as one of your adulterated SLICES. And it's DELICIOUS! And just for the record: 5 inches is *below* average, no matter what corporate may have told you. Your deceiver's heart no longer deserves my love, Cheesecake Factory. And so I bid you adieu..

That's how much I don't really care for this place). When we arrived we were greeted right away and our names were taken down so we could be seated. We waited about 10 mins and was seated in the bar area that they now use for regular dining on the booths. When we sat down, were were told by our server that he would be right with us. We waited 5 mins for him to come back to finally ask what we would like to drink. He brought us back our waters and didn't come back again until we, took about 5 mins to decide what we wanted to eat and FINISHED our complimentary bread and waited some more to finally be able to wave him down to come take our orders.. (that was longer than it should have been) in case you weren't getting my drift.  We ended up ordering their Shrimp Bistro, Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and their Avocado eggrolls. The avocado eggrolls came out not too long after our order was placed... We finished the eggrolls and were ready for our entree.. we waited, waited and waited.. WAITED to the point that we started picking at the noodles that were used on the appetizer plate to place the eggrolls on. I NEARLY FINISHED the noodles! I was so hungry and waited so long for the food. We never waited that long for our food to come out before. I noticed other tables that ordered after us already got their salad and their food. The server finally came back and apologized for the wait and used the excuse that he wanted us to really enjoy our avocado eggrolls first.. UMMMM I NEARLY cleared the entire plate even the noodles cause you got me waiting so long here.. just bring me my food! Well.. to no surprise.. the food still was not ready and only came back later to tell me.. ""it'll just be a few more minutes"".... I do not want to hear that.. He finally decided to ask if we wanted our salad first so we decided to just have that.. We literally waited a good 20-30 mins before we got our food after waiting 10-15 mins to just get our order in. Not good! He finally brought us our pasta and we were finally happy.. The salad was not that great. It was HUGE! but the taste of it just wasn't good for me.. I had maybe two bites from it. The shrimp bistro was good though, I liked it a lot, but because of the long wait.. I just wasn't feeling it anymore. We ended up boxing up more then half of our salad and pasta after 15 mins of eating our food.  Service is a big deal to me, and I was not too happy with the service we received last night. I most likley will not be back unless I get another gift card or I have no choice. But I was never a fan of The Cheesecake Factory to begin with.

I don't like my pastas to taste sweet, the waitress was nice enough to comp a new entree. The service was okay, our server was not very nice, but at least she accommodated my meal.

As soon as we entered, we knew the wait for indoor seating was going to be a while considering the amount of people crowding up the waiting area. So we asked for outdoor seating. Wait was only 10 minutes which was pleasantly surprising. Our waitress was prompt and courteous. Danielle was her name. Anyway, we ordered from the small plates menu since it was late and we didn't want a full on dinner plate. Here's what we got: Santorini Farro Salad Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries Fried Zucchini Roasted Pear & Bleu Cheese Flatbread (Pecans, Arugula and Caramelized Onions) For me the flatbread was the night's winner. Just nice balances among the savory, chewy and sweet. I wanted to do a second order to take home but was too full to get anymore. A good one to try out if you're there! In hindsight, we shouldn't have order the fried zucchini AND the Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries because the ""zucchini fries"" in the trio were the same as the ""fried zucchini"" order. Batter was okay. Nothing outstanding unless you dip it heavily in the provided dips, which I do not know what they were since we were never told about them as the orders arrived.

About 15 minutes later our food arrived. I looked at my plate and couldn't believe what I saw. There was a lunch size portion of food on the plate. They wanted$17.95 for it. My wife looked at it and said the same thing. Definitely not worth $17.95.  I asked a server to get the manager. I explained the situation and he offered to either replace it with something else or he could have more pasta added to it. I opted fomore pasta. When the plate returned it had twice as much as it had before. Good manager, great dish. Excellent blend of pasta, marinara, shrimp and sausage. I would order it again, except with a lot of pasta.

The food was always great, the servers treated you well and it was an experience that was just different. Now days, every time I go it seems like a huge ordeal with long wait times, an extremely crowded front area and food that lacks any real flair. Service there can still be quite good but it seems that they are really just churning the customers as fast as they can to deal with the crowds.  I had the Jambalaya pasta with shrimp and it was indeed spicy, great for me and was as expected from the warnings on the menu. The pasta seemed a bit overdone but the shrimp was damn near perfect which well made up for it.  Wife had the Miso Salmon which was amazing and well done. The miso added a good amount of sweetness to the fish and I was pleasantly surprised that it was throughout the cut and not just on the surface. Shared the Macadamia nut-caramel and was pretty disappointed. The nuts were soggy and not flavorful at all. Caramel was like a sauce that was bland and again, lacked any real flair.

I love their cucumber lemonade with a passion (best drink I have ever had), I love their cheesecake (obviously) - definitely try their salted caramel cheesecake! Perfect amount of sweetness and saltiness.  I usually get the same thing every time (their BBQ ranch chicken salad) which is amazing. The portion size is crazy! So big but I am not complaining!  I have no complaints about any of the other dishes I have tried, I always enjoy coming here.

It was such a beautiful day, so outside in the patio area with the spot to be. My husband and I had our orders taken and or drinks brought out, but what made it even better was the busser.

Kev O.,"Irvine, United States",32,391,868,4.0,21/6/2015,"Had actually planned on a more romantic restaurant with an ocean view on this date, but found that everything was fully booked for father's day weekend. So, it was a toss up between my date's suggestions of Denny's, IHOP, and Cheesecake Factory because it was less likely that these places would be fully booked.....I thought that perhaps my date was just testing me, so I chose the CF :)  I'd been to many other CF restaurants and knew they'd have an excellent selection of food choices on their menus....whether it's for the hungry or weight watchers. I'm glad I came here as the quality has always been consistent throughout all the CF's I'd been to so far.  Upon entering, it's pretty much the same decor and layout as any other CF. I guess I should have expected that even at 5.45pm this place was pretty full! However, when I went up to the hostess at the counter and inquired about the wait time, I was surprisingly told just 2 minutes! I then asked if it was the same for a booth? I was then told 15 minutes. Ok, not a problem as my date was still on her way anyway. I was given a buzzer which would go off when our table was ready,....and less than 3 minutes it goes off! That was fast!....and there was still a big crowd waiting around in the lobby area.  I love the free bread here, they're always so fresh and warm, and yummy with butter! But oh so easy to fill up on before your main meal comes! My date ordered the Chicken with Biscuits with Gravy.....the chicken usually comes sauteed, but she wanted them fried, which the waitress said was not a problem. I went ahead and ordered the combination dinner of Grilled Salmon, Chicken  Madeira which came with mashed potatoes and Asparagus spears. The portion of my dish was big, but her's was huge....and very delicious! Believe it or not I couldn't finish my chicken and mashed potatoes! She ended up having to doggie bag more than half her dinner. I have a feeling the bread and two apple martinis she had had filled her up :) Anyway, all in all it was a very good dinner and a pretty nice experience, although the place had now gotten completely packed and very noisy....yea, not the most romantic atmosphere for a date, but oh well :) After we finished dinner we then noticed how pleasant the weather was and how we probably should have sat at the outdoor patio, which was full too, but less noisy and much more airy. Oh, when I drove into this strip mall I was kind of fearing having to find parking as the lot was packed. Thank goodness that just beyond the Cheesecake Factory was a valet parking stand, and for just $5 you can save yourself some headache.....definitely worth it. Service here was good for how busy the place was....food consistently good quality....although I don't see my favorite Avocado Eggrolls on the menu anymore...that was a bummer :(",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=180

Of course, we couldn't leave without having some cheesecake.  We enjoyed some fresh strawberry cheesecake and oh, was it soo good.  It was just the perfect sweetness, not overpowering with sugar yet very sophisticated sweetness that you can taste off in the distance. I love the light and airiness of the whipped cream.  We were so stuffed but it was so good.  We were excited to bring home our leftovers so we can enjoy it for another meal.  You have to go..

The breading on the chicken was light and crispy and sauce on the pasta was tangy and delicious. The noodles were al dente, which is  how I like it. The best part of the meal of course was the cheese cake. I ordered the S'mores cheesecake, and it was great. The marshmallow they use for it is made in house and they even char the marshmallow with a torch to give it that smokey s'more flavor and smell as you eat.

Once you place your hand on the bun and press down, the fried cheese balls burst and even start gushing over the side of your burger. It is extremely beautiful!

Jennifer C.,"Huntington Beach, United States",15,34,1,1.0,13/8/2016,"I previously gave Cheesecake Factory the full five stars. But! I am reprising my previous review and rating after the excessively poor service we've received in our last three interactions with them. Tonight was the final straw. We called in for curbside To Go. Waited on hold for 10 minutes before Rachel got back on the line. She was confused and rude in her tone and service. We did not complain. She took the order, she was communicated to that we were paying by gift card, she was confused. My husband asked how long the process would take. She relaid approximately 25 minutes.  My husband drove to the restaurant within the timeframe, parked and called the curbside number. The hostess cut him off and put him on hold for 10 minutes. She got on the line finally then disregarded what he was saying and transferred him to make an order. He called back. He was placed on hold again. When the gal answered she asked him to drive around and come back. EXCUSE ME? My husband got a manager. In total it took staff about 45 minutes at curbside PLUS the 25 minutes when the order was placed to hand the food, now COLD, to my husband. Add another 10 minutes to figure out billing, surprise we paid by gift card - like they were not told multiple times. Needless to say, this is our last visit to the Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach. The staff and customer service is a sorry joke. We spend roughly $200 easy when we go.

Tonia B.,"Anaheim, United States",387,15,,2.0,1/2/2017,"I, normally, never write Yelp reviews, but the service I received today was inadequate enough for me to take the time to share my experience.  First off, I have work experience in the food industry. Therefore, I have an understanding of what it is like to deal with complicated customers or even just trying to get through a tedious shift on a bad day. I have been to this location recently in December and received the same subpar service but not enough to the point of publication. The repeat of a bad experience, regardless of whoever served me, had already set a mood.  My party of four was seated quickly. Alexandria, our waiter, promptly addressed the menu and was attentive to us from the very beginning, until we were waiting fifteen minutes for her to put in our order. She was stationed in an area that had about five distinct parties of three or less; therefore, a small wait was understandable. However, what we did not appreciate was the fact that we were waiting while she was chatting with another coworker at the register. It was not until I flagged her down as she was, again, passing her booth, that we finally put in our orders. She was very nice about accommodating to our orders, giving us advice about customizing our entrees, and suggesting me a dish that fit my preferences that was not my initial choice. So, we waited and noticed that the food was taking a while to come out. Thirty minutes had passed and the first dish came out. Just one. Normally, when only one dish comes out, other dishes follow right after, but we were left waiting another 10-15 minutes for two more dishes. At this point, we were agitated because we were hungry, like all humans. What was interesting was that another server came by to tell us that the last dish had been sitting on the counter for some time and got cold; therefore, they had to toss it up again for it to be warm. The very first dish had to be taken back to warm up as well. My dish was not the dish I had originally decided on with her upon ordering. The last dish was the only dish that did not have complications to it. When we received our bill, one dish was charged as a dinner entree when we had all said lunch sized portions. Though it could have been a misunderstanding, I thought it was a bit peculiar that one person out of a party of four who came during lunch special hours would order a dinner entree. I think she should have clarified our orders before giving them to the kitchen for the sake of that mistake.  Alexandria addressed our problems professionally and still maintained a level head despite the tension and frustration that came with the miscommunication. Mistakes are okay; they are what makes us human. However, when mistakes are being repeated and unattended to, they become problems and that was the case here.  Please consider being more organized or stationing employees better throughout the vicinity to ensure that each customer gets the undivided attention that comes with having exemplary customer service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=120
JEWELS Z.,"Placentia, United States",94,12,,3.0,15/6/2017,"I had been looking forward to the teriyaki chicken, as it is a favorite of mine, from their menu. As usual, it was very good, except for the bananas, which had been seasoned with pepper. However, my friend ordered the four cheese pasta,  which took too long to be brought out, and was surprisingly salty. We informed Rachel,  our server,  when she came to clear the plates, and she saw that more than half portion was still left, and her response was ""oh, no"", not can I get you something else, or something to that effect. I was really disappointed, and for that reason I only left her a $5 tip, despite being a very generous tipper. It's a shame their customers are not valued, to try to keep them happy.

Maila H.,"Orange County, United States",398,368,4584,4.0,28/12/2014,"After a day of shopping at Bella Terra, we decided to finish the day off by going to Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the one in Brea and Anaheim but this was a first for the Huntington Beach location. Last weekend of 2014, we expected the wait to be longer than usual. Went inside to give the hostess our name and was given a wait time of 30 min. Not to bad after seeing the amount of people waiting inside. The computer system had just crashed so it was a bit chaotic. Hostesses and management walking around like chickens with their heads cutoff was entertaining to watch while we waited for our seats. After waiting 20 minutes, our names were called and we were seated in the patio. Large patio area seating with fountains, heat lamps and decor lighting. Beautiful sunny California weather and people watching with the only downfall, the restaurant is located right next to the freeway. I inhaled more carbon monoxide than fresh air. Sometimes you can't have it all. FOOD- The Cheesecake Factory has one of the most extensive menus and is not only limited to Cheesecakes.  - Small plates - Snacks - Appetizers - Salads - Pizza - Hamburgers - Sandwhiches - Pastas - Steaks, Chops, Fish & Seafood - Specialties - Sunday brunch With so many different entrees, it made choosing difficult. Luckily, I wasnt hungry so I took my time ordering. I even passed up on the free breadsticks. I decided to order the Bang Bang chicken with shrimp and babes choose the Rib eye steak with steamed broccoli. Bang Bang chicken with shrimp was a spicy Thai dish with curry, peanuts, chili and coconut served over brown rice. The perfect definiton of DELICIOUS! I love me some Thai but this by far takes the crown for best Thai curry dish. Ironically, I wasn't even dining at a Thai restaurant. I sampled the rib eye cooked to medium. It wasn't the best presentation but the flavor and tenderness made up for it.  DESSERT- Finished the meal off with Pineapple upside down cheesecake with a side of vanilla ice cream. It wasnt my first choice as they had ran out of the seasonal Pumpkin cheesecake with pecans. Sad. The cheesecake was a little too sweet and the combination of upside cake and cheesecake was a bit off. Next time I'll stick with the red velvet or the carrot cheesecakes. Can never go wrong with those two choices. SERVICE- Our waiter was friendly and provided us with good service. The only bad thing I could say is when I asked him what was good on the menu, his reply would be "" everything "". Even when it came to Cheesecakes he said "" everything was good "". Suggestions would have been helpful, although I probably wouldn't have taken them. Other than that, no complaints. PARKING-  Cheesecake Factory valet parking $5.00 and general parking is free. Finding close parking is always a hit or miss, but there plenty available parking spread across the shopping center and restaurants. OVERALL EXPERIENCE- Not the biggest fan of restaurant chains, but Cheesecake Factory is an exception. Great menu, delicious food and decent prices.

I'm usually not one to make a scene my husband however was starving and pissed off at this point. We asked to see the manager and it took another 15 minutes to see him. Mind you, we didn't even have our drink order in yet. He came out, didn't even apologize, had an ""I don't care"" attitude, took our order which was another 30 minutes! This was outrageous!

I showed the manager and picked it up with my fingers and it stayed as straight as my straw. It was spaghetti by the way. The bright spot was that the waiter was good, he gave us great service all around. But what pissed me off the most was when the bill came, the manager had the decency to tell me that he hooked me up by taking away my plate from the bill. I took 3 bites out of my plate before I asked you to remove it without replacing it. He didn't hook me up, he did his job!!!!

Place is usually pretty busy but the wait to get a table isn't too long.  The only gripe I have is the price of cheesecake.  $7 - $8 a slice is pretty expensive but it's so yummy!  Also why do they have advertisements on their menus?

Ken M.,"Gardena, United States",4,12,,4.0,19/2/2014,"Located right off the 405 and inside the Bella Tella outdoor shopping center, this one is pretty clean and modern and they've got an outdoor patio that can handle a table for two, as well as larger parties.  Parking can be tight on weekends in the nearby lot near Barnes & Noble, so if it's crowded, I'd suggest parking in the structure on the other side towards Costco.   If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory, anticipate your entrée being a pretty good sized portion.  One of my favorite appetizers here has got to be the fried mac n' cheese, which is certainly not an everyday food, but heck, once in a while, you deserve it.  Their sweet tamale corn cakes are another winner, especially if you're not in the mood for meat.  Garlic noodles aren't too shabby, either.  Sandiwiches are also pretty solid and seriously, their menu has so many different types of food, there's bound to be something for everyone.   Of course, you probably want to save some room for cheesecake, though they're usually in the $7-9 range per slice, so they're not as reasonably priced as their entrees.  If you're looking for something not too sweet, opt for the vanilla cheesecake.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=540

It is so delicious it keeps you wanting more.

She was also very helpful and nice. My cousin got the Louisiana pasta as well. She loved it! And my friend got the steak Diane with mashed potatoes and shrimp scampi, which was also delicious.  We then moved onto desserts, i got the tiramisu cheesecake, my sister and cousin got the fresh strawberry cheesecake, and my friend got the chocolate chip cheesecake.

Claire G.,"Long Beach, United States",252,93,79,5.0,11/8/2013,"My family and I ordered the following when we visited The Cheesecake Factory: Fresh Kale Salad, Stuffed Mushrooms, Crispy Crab Bites, Thai Lettuce Wraps, Steak Diane, Chargrilled Coulotte Steak, Banana Cheesecake and Original Cheesecake. The Fresh Kale Salad was served with cranberries, apples, marcona almonds and green beans tossed with a Buttermilk-Black Pepper Dressing. Although this menu item is listed under the small plates and snacks, the serving size was enough for my husband and I to share. We asked for the dressing on the side, so that we could control how much dressing to put because we don't like our salads drenched in dressing. We will definitely order this salad again because it is healthy, fresh, and delicious! The Stuffed Mushrooms were also listed under the small plates and snacks menu item, so we got 6 bite sized stuffed mushrooms that I shared with my husband. The mushrooms are stuffed with fontina and parmesan cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce. We will definitely order this menu item again because it was very yummy! The Crispy Crab Bites are featured in the small plates and snacks menu as well as in the SkinnyLicious Menu. These bite-sized little crab cakes are served with mustard sauce. This item tasted okay. There was nothing special about the flavors, so I will most likely not order this menu item again. The Thai Lettuce Wraps are featured under the Appetizers menu. When you receive this item, you will be amazed by the display of food and colors!  All of the ingredients are laid out on a boat shaped dish, so that you can create your own lettuce tacos!  Ingredients: Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. The mixture of all of these ingredients will burst into your mouth!  This dish is a bit messy, but definitely fun, colorful, and flavorful!  I will definitely order this menu item in future visits! Steak Diane: I asked the server about the most ordered menu item and he recommended the Steak Diane. This certified angus beef steak is adequately covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce (with few pieces of mushrooms) and served with perfectly mashed potatoes and grilled onions. This meal was by far, my most favorite menu item!  The portion sizes are large, so I was only able to eat half of what was provided.  This meal tasted even better for lunch the next day! My husband and daughter ordered the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak (Prime Sirloin). Although this steak is served with French Fries and Crispy Onion Rings, both my husband and daughter substituted this part with steamed broccoli.  From what I heard, they both enjoyed the steak and broccoli very much.  The steak was nice and tender and the sauce from the steak was delicious! Dessert: I shared a Banana Cheesecake with my husband and our daughter ordered the Original Cheesecake. The cheesecake tasted like bananas and the sliced bananas that covered the cheesecake were fresh. This cheesecake wasn't rich and sweet, which is exactly what I like! I will definitely order the banana cheesecake the next time I visit The Cheesecake Factory! Don't forget to try the fresh, warm, and delicious rye bread that is provided as soon as you sit down at your table.  Slather some of their sweet butter on that rye bread to get a taste of it!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=540

Cor V.,"Westminster, United States",0,383,294,3.0,8/1/2016,"Cheesecake Factory today after watching the Hateful 8 movie could not lift my spirits up....was it the movie or the omelette or the service??  Let's just say that the service could have been a bit better and the omelette was meh.....I really expected more from a simple spinach mushroom omelette...it came with dry slices of toast and I opted for their cubed potatoes.  Is it just me, or has the way you make omelettes changed....I expected the ingredients which also included cheese and bacon bits to be totally immersed and mixed within the omelette...helas it appeared that part was cooked separate and then FOLDED in separately cooked egg....oh well.  The toast came dry...no butter, no jellies.....and the potato squares got over cooked under the heat lamp....I can't blame the staff too much as one person waited on many many tables.....perhaps the movie had an influence on me.....you have to experience it yourself....and I should give the extensive menu at the Cheesecake Factory another chance....",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=540

I like to get a simple grilled piece of salmon here--nothing too exciting, but it's my go-to because I always find it moist and not overly-seasoned. Entrees aside, I personally think the best part of coming here is the cheesecake selection. My favorites are vanilla bean, dulce de leche, and banana because of their relative lightness.

They came back out and handed me the receipt.. exactly one hour after I placed my order! Feeling frustrated, I drove off only to realize they didn't give me my card back, so I had to turn around and call back to ask them to return my card. Once I returned home I was able to see that our food was now luke warm and had to put it in the microwave. They didn't even put bread in the bag with our meals. What a complete mess!!

Jessica D.,"Irvine, United States",172,217,150,3.0,17/12/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite restaurants. So I was happy when we were told our company was having our Christmas lunch here. We sat outside in the patio it was a great seating area for a large group. However when it came to the service that was another story. Our orders were called in the day before due to the large quantity of people we had in our group. What a nightmare when it came to bringing out all of our orders. There was absolutely no structure what so ever when it came to bringing out everyone's order. They were all over the place. I get that we were a large group of people, but I just feel if you know you have that many people coming to your restaurant you need to have some type of system in place. It was just pure chaos. I felt we spent more time trying to get everyone their food on the table then getting to enjoy our meal. Plus some of my co workers mentioned their soups were cold. 3 star for their patio atmosphere and their cheesecake of course. I highly recommend their Adam peanut butter cheesecake. I had their Cobb salad it was pretty good, but I definitely would not recommend this place for a large group.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=260

Again, just okay. The tacos are crispy, while I prefer soft, and the black beans it comes with were undercooked. The tempura batter felt a little heavy and overpowered the fish.

We usually have Bre as our server and she is great! Tonight we had Britany and while she had a nice smile the experience was terrible. She clearly forgot to ring in our food as 30 minutes or more passed after we ordered and she never came by the table. While we were looking for someone to let them know we hadn't received our food a manager showed up. James was his name I believe. He smelled like a cigarette and while he was apologetic he didn't even know what we ordered. Once the food arrived no one came by to even quality check our food. The check was dropped and again no server for 15 minutes. Thank goodness we paid cash so we could leave to make our movie..

Mohib Q.,"Los Angeles, United States",150,363,3201,1.0,16/3/2013,"I came here on a Saturday night around 9:30 p.m., and to my surprise found seating within five minutes. This was by far the most impressive part of the night.  After being seated near a noisy bar, and noisy patrons, I found myself searching for a light to read my menu. This was downright ridiculous. The lighting in the restaurant was so dim that I could not see the menu, whether it was lighting from above or the candle at the table. After about 10 minutes of using my phone's light, I selected the mushroom burger. After flagging our waitress down, we finally ordered and waited another twenty minutes for the food to arrive. I couldn't say I was impressed by the service nor the people who were sitting next to us chatting away.  The mushroom burger was decent, but not outstanding. Taste did not stick out, nor did quantity. Instead, everything was noted to be fresh and filling, but rather bland and cold. I truly was not surprised at this point.  I realize that this was a poor choice in that I came on a busy night, where personal service could not really be guaranteed. Staff are being rushed and lean, and the pressure shouldn't be on them. It's a management issue, and surely the food could have more flavor.

Jr W.,"Orange, United States",0,3,,1.0,26/6/2017,"On June 23rd my family & myself decided to dine at one of your restaurant chains in Huntington beach because my girlfriend had received a gift card from one of her cousins a couple weeks prior as a birthday present because her cousin knows we tend to come dine at some of your restaurant locations at least a couple times a month because my family admires the great quality of food & service we always receive but sadly this was not one of those days. We can most of the time estimate how soon our appetizers & meals would come out especially if it's a packed house or not & we can understand when it's busy. But at 9pm to 11pm is not your peak hour on busyness tonight. Waiting over an hour for a Louisiana chicken pasta, bacon cheeseburger, kids quesadilla & chicken Madeira should not take that long to prepare. After paying for the bill I went up to the hostess desk to ask to speak the manager. Finally the manager who presented himself as Joe which Nicholas (the busboy) told me that was the manager he had told that i wanted to speak to him during our meal but never came after being told twice. I proceeded to let the manager know where I was sitting in the restaurant & that I seen him talking to the table next to us informing them of what I over heard him tell them apologizing on the food taking so long & he confirmed what I heard was true & that he said that. Then I told him that i asked Nicholas that I wanted to speak to a manager & he confirmed that Nicholas told him but Joe lost track of the time & after asking Nicholas a second time that I would like to speak to the manager he acknowledged that Nicholas told him again but then Joe said he looked at our table & seen our food was finally there so he figured the problem was solved without ever coming to talk to me & ask me what I needed. I then asked Joe why he never came by our table after being asked twice by Nicholas & he told me after the first time I asked to speak to him that he went up to our waitress Jenna & asked what I wanted to speak to him about but he said Jenna told him that we were just waiting on our food & wondering when it was coming out. I asked him why he did not come the 2nd time after asking for him & he said because he seen the food finally arrive on our table so he figured the problem was solved. I then asked him how he came to that assumption of why I wanted to speak to him because I never told Jenna or Nicholas that I wanted to speak to him on what was taking so long with our meals. I told him that i never even mentioned to Jenna our waitress that I wanted to speak him & that I only told Nicholas if he can ask the manager to come over. I then asked Joe if always puts his customers on hold or just ignores there request to speak with them without even knowing what they might need help with. He than apologized acknowledging he was wrong for not coming by after being requested twice & then I asked him why the food was taking so long today & that it was unacceptable for how long it took to get our meals when the restaurant was only half full at 10pm. He tried to tell me that the food was being prepared on time & when I brought up what he said to the customers who sat next to us & were seated after us that I over heard him apologizing about there food taking a long time that he would comp them salads & give more bread while they waited for there meals, he than agreed that he said that to them & apologized to me for our meals coming out so late. After hearing your manager Joe trying to lie to me & to keep getting caught in a lie & then apologizing to me after I keep bringing up the true facts, it's very upsetting to me that you would have a manager that has no respect for your customers & upon request to speak with him twice & Joe acknowledging that there seems to be a problem with the food taking longer than expected or a unhappy customer having terrible service, that he would just ignore them than instead try to figure out the problem & make both sides happy. I really hope you look into who you have in management in the future & that they get the right training to deal with their customers & not manage like Joe did tonight to ignore, lie & be comfortable w/ your customers leaving unhappy.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=260

More orders of cheesecake from here? I think yes. Our server, Brandon, was super sweet and awesome. Very attentive and did everything just right.

Karen C.,"Costa Mesa, United States",0,10,,3.0,24/11/2015,"We tried the Cheesecake Factory a couple of years ago and didn't go back because service was poor. I remember being disappointed because I liked their menu. We decided to give them another try last week. Our waitress was swift, polite, and anticipated our needs. So we went back this week and it went south this time. Had to go to hostess up front because it was a long time and no one had come around. When waitress finallycame to take our order, It took longer than it should for us to get our drinks. The waitress didn't check back after we ordered and waited for our meals, so I ran out of soda and had to wave her down. And it took a LONG time - don't blame server, must have been a kitchen problem. As we finally began our meal, noticed waitress had several tables and was chatty with a couple of them, but pretty much left us alone. But also noted waiters/waitress very chatty with each other, overheard one say ""he ask me what I had been doing . . ."" Can't say servers were lazy or not doing their jobs, just that they didn't seem to give a (darn). There are so many places, with good food, better service. For the price, we should have a better experience. We weren't happy.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=580

Mandy M.,"Orange County, United States",70,51,34,3.0,31/5/2014,"My boyfriend and I decided to stop by here after not having too huge of a clue of where we wanted to go for dinner - I wanted steak and my boyfriend wanted something not steak.  Figured we'd pop by here. It was busy and we were told we'd have a 15 minute wait, but our buzzer buzzed immediately! Oh goody! Food! Nope. We handed the greeter our buzzer, and then... we were put in a line. There was only two groups ahead of us, but talk about playing with your head here! I guess their wait time average was accurate. -_- But I believe you should only be buzzed when it is your turn. Anyway, we sat down and we were greeted by our waiter, Philip (Or Phillip?), and after some glances at the menu we had decided what we wanted. He took our drink order, my BF had the tea in passion-fruit, and I had a frozen strawberry margarita. Having been to many bars, I am a bit picky. Margarita was not very sweet even when I asked for sugar on the rim. I'd give the margarita alone a 7/10. We had ordered beef kabobs for appetizers, and then I decided on the filet mignon, and BF had ordered fish and chips. So the atmosphere is nice outside, cute patio, you know. We wait about twenty-five minutes and our dinner is served. Filet was yummy, and BF enjoyed his fish and chips. About halfway into our meal.... Our beef kabobs come. Talk about awkward.. Anyway.. We just decided to box the entire thing up. Dinner portion was great. We also took a strawberry shortcake home in a to go box, which was great later at home. Philip did a great job making sure everything was being taken care of, but otherwise this place is decent for being a chain restaurant.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=580

Westley Y.,"Fountain Valley, United States",86,436,1415,2.0,6/5/2014,"This Restaurant is located on the backside of the Bella Terra Shopping Center. The Cheesecake Factory is best known across the globe for its extensive and creative menu, generous portions, distinctive decor and legendary desserts. With more than 250 menu selections - all handmade, in-house with fresh ingredients - and more than 50 signature cheesecakes and desserts, there is truly ""Something for everyone"" at The Cheesecake Factory. It was my Mom's Birthday and she got a gift card from one of her co-workers so we all when out on a Tuesday night for Birthday dinner. When we arrived we were greeted right away which was nice. I gave them our name and within a few minutes they took us to our table. We sat in the giant booth that fits 7 people in the center of the room. Everything was looking good so far. Our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed and tired she was saying weird thing but we took it with a grain of salt. We told her were just sat down and needed a few minutes to look over what we wanted to order. Well we shouldn't have said that because literally she never came back. Ha ha we waiting for like 20 minutes an then I said enough of this so I waved down another server to get us started with Drinks. I know just drink right. Horrible!  Then when it came time to order our food our same original server came back and she was a wreck, she looked horrible. Her hair was a mess and all sweaty and it seem like she was inconvenienced to take our order.  I was thinking at that time if I were her boss I would have had a talk with her saying either get it together or go home. We ordered our food and each plate had different things that were requested and of course when we got our meal it was missing sides and not cooked the way we wanted it so on and so forth. The recap was their service level was a 1 out of 10 and they food was okay but not what we expected. I mean it was a Tuesday night and it was a slow, so there shouldn't be any excuses as to why everything sucked. My Mom used to love this place now after this bad experience she probably will never go back again.  That server f-ed it up for us.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=580

As the holidays are approaching, I wanted to see the holiday hours for this Cheesecake Factory since it's near where I live and I was craving some cheesecake. Today was Thursday and they closed at 11pm. I figured when I called (it was 12:45am), it would just send me to the automated voicemail and I would hear the holiday hours. To my surprise, a girl picked up. Employee: Cheesecake Factory Me: Hi. I was wondering what your holiday hours were for this weekend? Employee: ...Are you serious? Me: Yes. Employee: Well we're open til 12:30 on Friday and Saturday and closed on Christmas Day. Me: Okay, thanks so much. Employee: Yeah. Really? I'm sorry if you had to stay back late. I'm glad that you picked up the phone, but honestly, if you're gonna be that rude, I'd rather you not pick up the phone at all and just let the message play.

Nikki M.,"El Segundo, United States",471,346,117,4.0,19/11/2011,"We've all bene to Cheesecake Factory. But what makes this one different? It has a happy hour, that's what! Only a few locations in the US actually have a HH, so this makes bump up the rating from what would usually be a three star review for any other Cheesecake Factory location. So please, bare in mind... *This review is for the happy hour only"" Don't even get me started on corporate restaurants, Cheesecake's ANNOYING long menu, or their overly sweet cheesecakes. I'll review the happier, more alcoholic side to Cheesecake. My friend and I were trying to figure out a spot for happy hour, and Bella Terra happened to be located conveniently for both of us. She suggested Cheesecake Factory. ""Say whatttt? They have a happy hour,"" I responded. ""Yep!"" And we were on our way. I've been back once since my first time. They have a nice selection of cocktails on happy hour (including my favorite cosmo) as well as deals on beer and a few varietals of wine (chard, cab, merlot, sauv blanc, and pinot...if I remember correctly). They also have a GREAT selection of food on happy hour, including appetizers and small plates that range from $5-8ish. The first time I came, I ordered a glass of the sauv blanc and the grilled artichoke. Artichoke = perfection, with a garlicky aioli. We have a winner! Second time, I was back with a big group - beers, cosmo, mojito (which was made incorrectly and was wayyyy to sweet and reminded me of why I don't usually like Cheesecake), and sauv blanc/pinot were all ordered by us. One friend ordered the spinach artichoke dip, which turned out be my favorite this time, and another friend and I spitl the crab artichoke dip (this was pretty meh). We also ordered the greek salad and gorgonzola salad. All of this was on happy hour. Someone else at the table also ordered mac and cheese and said it was pretty good. Of all of the stuff we've tried, this is only the tip of the iceberg for the happy hour menu, and happy hour menus are usually pretty short. Nice selection of both food and drinks, all for reasonable prices. Good pick for happy hour!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=580

The last time i was here i found a hair in my pasta and that ruined the whole dish for me. I was pretty mad and of course i complained, the manager completely understood and made it up to me with a comped giant ice cream sundae.

Tonight  however has been a disaster.  The pace of service was ridiculous between  order and entree and when the entrees did make it to the table both of our pasta orders were severely undercooked.  Our waitress could see we were not happy bit did not choose to attempt to do anything  about it nor did the manager who's only involvement in our meal was to tell us it would be out soon.   I will definitely eat here again but had this been my first time it would most assuredly be my last.  I feel that tonight's entire team that was involved in my meal needs to be retrained in their customer service skills.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=320

The food is always sufficient for what you'd expect at a Cheesecake Factory, so I'd say it is 5-star for consistency and Cheesecake Factory caliber.  My 5-star review is in large part for the tan, short-haired male server who helped me and my boyfriend tonight. We only stopped in for a glass of wine and a dessert. When ordering wine, he offered multiple types of Chardonnay - impressive! When I asked if they had a dairy-free and egg-free, he said no but proposed a bowl of fresh strawberries minus the whipped cream - sooooo not expecting such a recommendation for such an atypical question, but WOW is that great customer service! Unfortunately, I don't remember his name (sorry!!).  In addition, he kept our waters filled and a friendly server came to offer us a bread basket.

Tracie L.,"Orange County, United States",1055,634,3147,5.0,27/7/2012,"This cheesecake factory is close by and I prefer it over the Newport beach or Irvine Spectrum one because there's rarely ever a wait! Service is fast and everytime I come here, I never had a bad waiter/waitress. They're all very friendly and helpful at suggesting different dishes. I wasn't going to write a review til, but after coming yesterday 7/25/12, I had to make sure I finished a review for it. I had a great experience yesterday. My bf & I came w/ his little nephew and waited no longer than 3 mins for a table. Our waitress (Tricia) was a total doll! She got us 2 of the fresh warm right out of the oven wheat bread (their addicting brown bread everyone talks about) as requested since we don't like the sourdough one. The food took a while to arrive, but they were pretty busy that night. So here's where Tricia saved them from being a 4 star: After looking at their nutritional guide menu (LOVE THAT THEY GIVE YOU THIS!!) and skinnylicious menu I decided to get the Island grilled chicken w/ NO SALT and sauce on the side. She got the order right, but the chef over grilled the chicken AND pineapple, it was pretty damn black and gross. I didn't wanna be a lil complaining customer or anything cause my bf & nephew already started eating their food and I was starving so i just ended up trynna cut off the burnt part which was more than half the chicken.. Tricia saw this and said she was more than happy and wanted to bring the plate back and ask them for a new one! She even offered me a dish on the house so that I wouldn't be starving while waiting :) The new plate came out and was BOMB dot com!! grilled perfectly and everything was great. +1 for her customer service My bf had the kobe burger med. rare and it was sooo good. Juicy patty and the mushrooms all mixed well together. We were able to save room for dessert and got their low carb cheesecake w/ strawberries. I know what you're thinking..it's cheesecake factory we're probably over the 2000 calorie limit anyway so why not just get the real shit right? LOL well just for my carb conscious self I thought i'd give it a try to see how it tasted compared to their regular cheesecake. Well..IT TASTED JUST AS GOOD AS THE REGULAR ONE!! I wish they made more low carb cheesecakes especially their oreo one haha.

If you go here ask to be waited on by James. He made sure we were taken care of and was attentive to our table.  Only reason why I gave a 4 star instated of 5 is because our main entrees were not great.  I ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair and the pasta was poorly cooked, pasta came in chunks stuck together and the shrimp was over cooked and overall dry. My husband ordered a chicken sandwich and it tasted like it was deep fried in old oil that had been used for a while. Maybe they just had an off day but James immediately took care of us.  We ordered another entree and the Ahi salad I ordered and the Cuban sandwich my husband ordered was great!! We will be going back and definitely asking to be seated in James' section.

Vi V.,"Orange County, United States",281,760,3358,3.0,24/3/2014,"Located in the Bella Terra area next to the Barnes and Nobles. Parking is always horrible here, but there's a parking garage if you don't mind the walk. Walked in and the place is pretty dimly lit so it gave off a romantic feel without having to be all dressed up. Cheesecakes are on the left when you walk in if you want to look at it. What we got: Bread & Butter: they bring it out to you after you order. It comes with a brown wheat bread (but sweeter) and a sourdough bread. They bring out butter squares too. The butter is cold so it was hard to spread.  Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll ($13): it was a deep fried sushi roll with tuna inside. It had green onion shreds on top of it and a soy sauce dipping sauce. Not something I would get again. The tuna was all mushy inside, green onion shreds were more like presentation than something edible. Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta ($17): our server said this was his favorite dish and I can see why. Comes with chicken, asparagus, peas, and tortilla strips on top of penne pasta with a spicy chipotle sauce. I thought it was really good and they give you a lot so I was able to have it for lunch the next day. Big chunks of chicken, but they didn't have much flavor. The veggies inside the pasta were soft and actually tasted pretty good. I loved the spicy chipotle sauce though, not too spicy, but does have a nice kick. I just wish the pasta was cooked a little longer because it was too al dente for me. Steak Diane ($20): cuts of angus beef steak covered with mushrooms and grilled onions and a side of mashed potatoes. Steak was cooked perfectly and it was soft and juicy, but my favorite thing would probably have to be the mushrooms. I don't know what they did to it but it was so good! It was soft and had so much flavor to it. Mashed potatoes were creamy, but nothing made it stand out from any other mashed potatoes. Service: Our server that night was Kyle. Friendly guy and would make conversations with us. He was quick to refill our water glasses and getting us anything else we needed.

My review is mostly focused on the food because we had a pretty horrible customer service aspect of dinner but it was out of the control of the staff so I won't blame them. I expect a pretty good quality of food for the prices and location and was overwhelmingly surprised at how great everything was. Started with a super manly (sarcasm) Peach Bellini (sp?) and it was amazing. Very few places I have been can nail this fairly simple drink like they did. I ordered two more. I cannot remember the exact name of my dish but it was some sort of Steak Diane or something like that. It was the best steak and potatoes dish I have had so far in Huntington Beach. Absolutely amazing sauce with flawless sides as if the dish needed to be any more amazing. My cousin also got the Gumbo or jambalaya dish, and it was also amazing. Perfect amount of spicy while still being deliciously seasoned. I must say I am sad to hear that the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake was taken off the menu. Lots of good choices of cheesecake but not many for people like me who don't want a overly rich cake.

Jason A.,"Cerritos, United States",1079,700,1631,4.0,26/10/2009,"This is the closest Cheesecake Factory to my work, so I come here once in a while and when they have crazy promotions.  My first time at this particular location was during their anniversary last year when they had 50% off all cheesecakes. Man alive, there were people flooding the main entrance all trying to get a slice or two...or three. Now, I do admit that getting most cheesecake aficionados tend to be of the larger variety, so I could be exaggerating when I say there were a lot of people in the doorway. It may have been just a couple really big ones.  Nonetheless, I realized that it would probably be faster and more efficient to just ask for a table and eat lunch...THEN order a slice of cheesecake to go! See, that's how you maximize your lunch break and still take advantage of the promotion.  I had the Da Vinci pasta and decided to take a chocolate Godiva cheesecake to go, since it's more chocolate than actual cheese. Though I've never been a large fan of cheesecake, seeing the richness of the chocolate made me reconsider my stance and give it a try.  I could feel my ass get larger with every bite once I took it back to the office. I knew this was bad and made a promise to light some incense in front of a picture of my dead relatives to bring me some good luck in ridding myself of this chocolaty goodness.  I ended up just fasting for the rest of the day and ran a few hours on a treadmill when I got home that day. Good enough.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=600

Within 30 minutes we were seated outside and I was amazed to see how nice the outside seating was! However, it was a bit cold and uncomfortable (and i was scared of bugs or ants). Our server didn't come by often enough, and we didn't have any plates to put our bread on.  I always hate how the menu at cheesecake is sooooo long!! I've always had the chicken bellagio but this time I got the chicken marsala and I LOVED IT!!!! I think that's what I'll get from now on. Although our server disappeared a lot, he was really nice.

But sure enough about 15mins later our name was called. Yaaaayy!!! We were all getting hungry and couldn't wait to order. We got seated and a few mintues later our waiter came and took our drink orders. When our drinks arrived he took our food order since we were all ready and not too long after our appetizier came out then our food. We are liking the fast service! The hubby got the louisiana chicken pasta which he said was good. I stole a bite and it was tastey. Nancy got the garlic noodles which is one of my faves. She enjoyed it. And I had the romano crusted chicken. It was salty! I mean it was like they poured salt all over my chicken and soaked my pasta in salt. It was unedible. Even Nancy took a bite and could not believe it. I had to send it back and our waiter was nice enough to ask whether I wanted a different dish or the same after he explained why it was too salty. I asked for the same and after a few minutes my new dish was out. He waited until I tried it before he left and it was perfect. So tastey and not salty at all! Thats great service.

This came with mashed potato in the middle and a nice big piece of salmon, brushed with herbs, placed in the middle. The whole plate came with a creamy, yet vinegary sauce that paired extremely well with both the salmon and mashed potatoes. The brown bread that they give you in the beginning is absolutely divine, especially when paired with this dish. So so great! My dad ordered this for me because I needed something soft to chew on, and it was perfect for that. Unfortunately, didn't get our waitress's name, but she was absolutely great!

Jenni I.,"Huntington Beach, United States",246,277,40,4.0,13/6/2012,"Great food, good service. Parking at bella terra is okay. They usually don't check the 40 minute spots (or we've just been lucky? extremely lucky? every single time? maybe). The wait was about 20 minutes... We were given a buzzer so that we could walk around the shopping center, though I'm not sure why they buzzed us if they weren't going to seat us right away.... Who knows. In any case, I ordered the shepherds pie (not what I expected it to be but I guess I should've read the description better...) and my bf got the filet mignon... which was meh in his opinion. On an unrelated note, they've gotten kind of cheap with their bread and gave only one roll of sourdough (I think it's sourdough) and one roll of squaw bread (but I'm sure if you asked they'll bring you more). The shepherds pie was good, but the meat wasn't what I expected. I thought I had read ""shredded beef"" which was actually more like... hamburger meat. Meh, I still like hamburgers... but my palate was not ready for that. It also comes with yummy mashed potatoes on top and is cooked with peas, carrots, and mushroom. I will say that the portion for the shepherds pie was HUGE. I'm still eating my leftovers and I think I'll be good for another meal (making three meals total) The filet mignon came with fries originally, but my bf switched it to mashed potatoes (it also came with two rather large onion rings, haha). He didn't really like the presentation. I'm not sure if he was completely full and satisfied with his meal. Prices are decent for what you get. Waitress was attentive and brought us many many waters (we were thirsty! what can I say~) Overall, it was a good meal, but I knocked off a star because we both seemed unsatisfied with our food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=600

We have a very particular group and she rolled with all of the requests and took care of everything without a problem. She even allowed us to get separate checks!!! This is unheard of in a group our size! The drinks and food were also awesome (My orange chicken was prepared perfectly). In fact, the only bummer about this location, is the parking situation. The restaurant is part of the Bella Terra Mall and people can be pretty jerk-like in the parking lot. There are limited spaces near the restaurant, so be prepared to walk - or splurge for the $5 valet parking (which I'll do next time).

From a rate of 1 to 10 in spiciness i say it must be a 1 lmao what a joke. They mention that its their most popular pasta dish. I don't know how they came to that conclusion because yes it taste like very fresh ingredients however where is that Southern Cajun Taste. I know how Jambalaya taste like this tasted no where near it and was really bland.

Basically, something for everyone. They also have some unusual milkshake alcoholic beverages that are really yummy as long as your not dieting, my god, because they are pretty rich. I've tried the Chocolate Monkey which was very good, almost a dessert in itself. I've also tried a peanut butter and chocolate concoction there also, very rich but very tasty if you like that sort of thing, which I do. Also the ambiance here is very nice. The Cheesecake Factory has a nice but casual feel to it. I also like the decor of this place. I like how at night the restaurant kind of dims its lights. Like I said, casual but nice. They have a great chicken salad sandwich with almond slivers in it to die for! I've also ordered their cheesecakes for birthdays also, which have always been awesome! I love how this restaurant has so much variety in their menu choices and in their cheesecake flavors. Makes for a unique dining experience that not just any restaurant can offer. I am definitely a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. The Cheesecake Factory in Brea and in Anaheim are also very good. This restaurant chain is highly recommended by me.

I'm sure a ton of people order something random just for their bread basket.  I mean...why else do people go to Cheesecake Factory? Ha, on a more serious note, they have a pretty good happy hour here.  I believe it's from 4-6:30 and everything is pretty darn cheap.  I would say, it ranges from $4-$6 and the good is a pretty decent portion.  They also have a small plates menu which is no way small.  Because let's be honest, Cheesecake Factory portions are known to be for people with endless stomachs.  The boy and I split the ahi carpaccio, roadside sliders, mac&cheese balls, and greek salad.  All were delicious.  I think there were 4 sliders and 4 mac&cheese balls which were pretty big portions considering how much they cost.  The mac&cheese balls were so disgustingly good.  It's that feeling where you want to eat the entire thing, but you know how bad it is for you.  Between the happy hour menu and the small plates menu, you have more than enough choices. I will definitely be back to try their other things on the menu.  It was a great way to try different things without being stuck with one ginormous platter of food that you will barely eat since you stuffed yourself with so much bread.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=660

Well... let me just say that this place is somewhere I'd go once in a while like on a date or something.  The food is all right.  It doesn't make me say ""damnnnn this is bommmmb"" or anything but its good.   Service was kinda bleh.  The lady seemed like she got mad everytime i asked for something.... Even though I was trying to ask with a smile! :) Hahah oh well... I guess that didn't work.   And whenever I come here... geez I feel like my eye sight gets worse and worse! The lighting is SUPER DIM!  Its like... uhhh can I get a flashlight up in here?! Hahah no but really... its dark. I guess they want that romantic-y type of feel.  So I this would probably be a good place to bring your bf's or gf's or someone who you really don't want to be seen with. HA I'm kidding again.  Anyway, as for food... the ones that I remember trying are: 1. chicken madeira 2. mushroom burger 3. philly cheesesteak 4. chicken & mushroom something pasta 5. hibachi steak 6. baked macaroni & cheese appetizer 7. white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake 8. the motherload chocolate cake (i think that's what it's called) **the following were tasted at different times... NOT in one sitting. hahah** So the food that I've tried, (i probably didnt list them all cuz I don't really remember the names... were just like my rating... A-OK. Nothing really stood out to me.

Lilian L.,"Midway City, United States",0,1,,4.0,25/4/2013,"Cheesecake factory, a fancy restaurant, can be an astonishing place to dine at  for a birthday dinner. It was great service and a waitress who welcome people the second they step in. There's not many cheesecake factories around Orange County. In fact, there are only 3 located around Orange County. One in Newport, Huntington Beach and Anaheim. Cheesecake factory has always been a busy place. Especially on weekends and occasions, an abundance of people come out to eat. Cheesecake Factory is not like any other restaurant.             The menu is a size of a bible. Their menu has over 200 different type of foods made from scratch each day. Combines to make an appetizing taste to everyone's tummy. Moreover, Cheesecake Factory have a portion of skinnylicious and small snack plates for those who stay fit and eat healthy. Just keep in mind that Cheesecake Factory has many varieties to choose from even for people who are eating healthy. So, this is definitely a place to go to if you haven't yet tried it already. There's also dessert like cheesecake and that obviously what this place is most known for. Known for their cheesecake. Many different flavors of cheesecake. Of course, original cheesecake too if you don't like any of the flavors that there is.             I've only been to Cheesecake Factory 5 times but I absolutely love it here! I've always wanted to try every single dish that they have. But, i only come here every so often. Only for occasional celebrations. The last time I've been here was for my friend's birthday. I honestly love the pasta here! Depending on what I crave that day, I usually only choose to look at the portion of pastas. It's the first thing I look for as soon as I grab onto the menu. Pasta Da Vinci is my favorite. The sauce is a light orange color that tastes just like thousand island salad dressing. The pasta is topped with sauteed chicken, mushrooms, onions and parmesan cheese. The taste of the creamy sauce is so delish. Melts into my mouths and feels as if I'm in heaven. All I think about is the greatness of how hot and tender the chicken and mushrooms are. Just by thinking about the name ""Pasta Da Vinci"" makes me ravenous already.            The location of cheescake factory that I go to is the one in Bella Terra on Edinger. Cheesecake factory is right next to Starbucks and right across from Buffalo Wild  Wings. There's not a problem about people wanting to sit outside and eat because there's a patio. Customers don't often complain about feeling frigid because there are fire pits and heaters to keep warmth surrounding the area. Workers try to satisfy their customers as much as possible and provide more than just a sufficient service towards everyone. The Cheesecake factory always has calming music for people to social with one another and the customer always seems to be jovial. This location at Bella terra is just like any other ones in Orange County. They're all the same and a utopian place to eat at every once in awhile but not a place to eat at daily. Thats why, its most known for having birthday dinners, going out on a date, or other gatherings               Overall, I rate this place a 9 out 10 because of the marvelous taste of different foods they have. I recommend to eat here. For ""first timers"" who haven't been here, its an amazing place. Not only the great taste of the foods but also the great service as well! Cheesecake factory fulfills my satisfaction and I can never be disappointed with anything that they serve. With over 200 types of foods in a large menu booklet, Theres not one thing that I don't like. The portion of different kinds of foods are so large that people often get lost in sight of what they want. In my opinion, definitely try to the pastas! I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do. Appetizers are another great choice as well if you're ravenous because it fills you up. Well, anything can fill you up actually. Because of how big the plates are, theres never too little. There's always an amount that's more than enough.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=680
Alina T.,"Cerritos, United States",0,19,1,1.0,29/8/2014,"Worst experience I've had at a restaurant ever. I drove 20 minutes to get here and this is the kind of shit that we're served?! My friend was really embarrassed to have taken us here. She was expecting something else, having gone to another Cheesecake Factory with great service and quality of food, and we ended up with below subpar food here. We got hard bread that was unedible. My friend got undercooked pasta, oily cold onion rings (he sent them back, and they still came back oily and cold). This Cheesecake Factory location is not the best for having dinner for friends. Also the 5-star review about the jambalaya was a lie. The reason why I think he or she posted it was for reasons of cash or because they confused this location for another Cheesecake Factory. To be honest the pasta was undercooked and a meat my friend was chewing...it was the type of undercooked-stringy tendon bad. And it was a mix of undercooked and overcooked meats. The buffalo blasts were the only redeeming quality of the dinner and one of my friends felt bad for the waitress because while the service wasn't that bad, the waitress deserved better because she was friendly and sociable. My friend does not recommend the pastas. It's not terrible but it's, at the very least, edible. If you're expecting college student homemade quality food  flavors (and your chef is your best friend who you love and you know is sensitive about hard crits and blunt honesty) that lasts in your mouth and you're alright with that, it's not as bad. The quality of the food they put out is not reliable. For the price Cheesecake Factory offers, the entrees are not that hyped up. The cheesecakes are the best of their menu and in retrospect this makes sense. Also I ordered Mac n cheese and just putting this out there a restaurant with the word cheese in it should not be serving Mac and cheese that someone with a complete lack of cooking skills could outcook. I have literally made better Macaroni and cheese. The bread is hard as stone and we asked for candles repeatedly but we never got any. I will never come back here again. I couldn't finish my meal. My friend ordered strawberry lemonade and he got something completely different. Also I'm here on a Friday, where there isn't even a lot business and as a person who works I cannot fathom how anyone would spend their hard earned cash on a 7 dollar bowl of absolute bland pasta that you can make for 50cents and I'm definitely not paying for the terrible cooking skills of the ""chef"" in the kitchen.  To make matters worse, at the end even the pen malfunctioned when I was writing the check. AND AS THE BIGGEST, WORST PART OF THE EXPERIENCE...one of my friends got seriously ill. We were watching uncomfortably as she literally hightailed to the restroom and threw up, for the second time. In one friend's opinion, the chef employed is bringing the reputation of the brand down. Only reason why I'm not giving this restaurant 0 stars is because it's not possible.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=680
Jaimie E.,"New Brunswick, United States",15,16,21,2.0,28/8/2010,"I really am done with dining at the Cheesecake Factory, the only reason you should be coming here is ... Surprise! Their cheesecake. That's it.  A lot of their food is overpriced for the way the food is prepared; I have experienced better meals at lower prices; why? Because these restaurants don't have a HUGE menu! The menu is enormous, it takes several minutes to figure out what exactly would be appetizing, when it comes out, you can TASTE the mediocrity, the instant powders, the stuff that you could have put together for a price less than what they have.  It's not all doom and gloom here at TCF, their cheesecake is phenomenal, something they seem to perfect and do well at. Every x amount of months, they come out with a new cheesecake to have people try. The new cheesecake, this time, was Piña Colada Cheesecake; it didn't appeal to me as much as the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake did. Yum! It's THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION that has me gnashing my teeth; I have been to TCF at Brea, HB, one in Arcadia, Pasadena and a few others. With this one!? I don't enjoy so much. I came back to this location for a 3rd chance, maybe it was a rookie cook? Maybe the recipe is really that awful tasting? Maybe I should have tried something that's more popular.  After looking at several reviews, and asking the waitress what entree was the most popular, I ordered the Spicy Crispy Beef and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Verdict? Gross. It's something you could have whipped up at home without paying $16.95 for. The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is not delicious, again, not for the price. The dish was nicely presented, the chicken was moist, the shrimp was nice, the taste of this dish overall was disappointing. It was as if one of the cooks took a ""Curry Spice"" seasoning powder and dumped it in a can of cream of coconut. The curry taste of the dish was artificial, just fake curry powder. The number of chicken and shrimp was rather small and there were more shreds of carrot and peas than rice.  The Spicy Crispy Beef was disappointing as well, I REALLY wanted to like this dish because I really enjoyed it when I had it at TCF in Brea. In Brea, their Spicy Crispy Beef was nicely crisped, not smothered in sauce, there was a huge portion of it, and you could taste the beef, taste the crispy exterior and that hint of sweet sauce. It reminded you of a Chinese take-out place where you'd order up your favorite calorie breaker and indulge in an evening of tasty junk food. The Spicy Crispy Beef experience at The Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach? Not likely the same experience, much more disappointing. In fact, it was more of an insult! The Spicy Crispy Beef was drowning.. Yes, DROWNING, in sweet sauce. The crispiness of the beef strips were no longer crisp because they were asphyxiated in tubs of the sweet gravy; the strips, were not strips.. There were six thick strips of beef. Granted, the beef was tender and meaty, but the strips were too thick to have been cooked properly to attain that crispy exterior, YOU EXPECT.  AND, it was more of an insult because it's as if the cook(s) expects me to like my Americanized Chinese food to be smothered in mountains of corn syrup gravy, so much that every other ingredient on my dish would cancel out. You know, I could've just asked for a funnel and a bottle of the Chinese style jus and chugged it myself.. And possibly for half the price!  The Cheesecake was great, it was what it always is -awesome. When you order it, it comes out rather quickly and you're ready to eat the only thing TCF has perfected. Cheesecake. The White Chocolate Macadamia nut caramel cheesecake was beautiful. No complaints there.  Service? On Par, never a bad day with the service at TCF, I enjoy the service, it's speedy, it's accommodating and they're always positive. How they manage to stay positive and well mannered in such a busy environment is amazing, I give them props.  So, the overall gripe that I have with TCF is their hot meals, their food is not worth the money, it really isn't. It's as if you're paying for the ""hip"" ambiance, the service, the HUGE portions of food they give you and the fact that TCF is always in demand and therefore they feel they can charge these really high prices and get away with it. Don't get me wrong, it's a restaurant, you're ALWAYS paying for service, sometimes ambiance and sometimes huge portions; I just don't think TCF deserves my money.. Unless it's cheesecake, and that's it! Note: THIS location is not the best, I gave it enough chances and none were satisfying.

Jason N.,"Westminster, United States",1,22,,5.0,16/2/2015,"I went here for Valentine's Day and although it was an extremely long wait, it was worth it. I got the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta and my girlfriend got the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pasta and I have to say that both were very good and worth trying. The chicken in the pasta is probably the best chicken I've ever had in any pasta at other restaurants because of how soft and tender it was. The entrees here are pricey but they are totally worth trying. We then got the Oreo Cheescake afterwards and couldn't finish it because of how sweet it was. It just got tiring and boring.

Pillin L.,"Costa Mesa, United States",1177,442,278,4.0,11/11/2010,"I walked into Cheesecake at about 5 o'clock on a Wednesday evening and I was pleasantly surprised. They have a happy hour!! Upon finding that out, we stroll to the bar and check out their menu. This isn't a TGIFridays happy hour. This is a The Cheesecake Factory happy hour. They had $5 appetizers. About 15 to choose from. And it's not just buffalo wings. Also on happy hour is small plates and snack. Prices varied from $5-$7. We decide to get the avocado egg rolls, roadside sliders and the ahi tartare. The ahi tartare was to die for! We wanted to order another one right after the first one came! It's small yes, but for 6.95, it's not such a bad deal. The avocados egg rolls were decent. I'm never a huge fan of them but it was tasty enough. The roadside sliders came with 4 sliders. Wow, they don't skimp on this happy hour. Only downside is their happy hour is from 4-6p.m.  I'm definitely coming back to try more things off their happy hour menu. It's a great deal. Drinks were a good deal too. mojitos, margaritas and long islands were all $5.Well drinks are $5 as well. I had a mojito and it was delicious. I asked the bar tender to make it with splenda instead of the simple syrup and she happily did it for me. Kuddos. I've eaten at Cheesecake many times and well. Their menu is very extensive.

An outdoorsy mall venue of some sort, similar to The Block, Irvine Spectrum, Victoria Gardens, etc... Cheesecake Factory - my friend girl (yeah, she's one of my bff's) and I went here, since she mentioned of an uber hot blonde friend of hers working here. It was a sunday early evening, we weren't too hungry, but thirsty and down for a drink or two (plus an appetizer combo of some sort). We came here to get away from the house, since we spent most of the day working on a car project of hers... Have you tried their Appetizer combo (forgot the actually menu name)? Geez, it sound just about right (size terms) on the menu, but can be a bit overwhelming for 2 people to devour. 4 plates of stuff rolled in, something like calamari, qeusadillas, mini sweet corn tamales, eggrolls/wraps, chips and spinach/artichoke dip, buffalo strips, pot stickers. It was a lot of food, and that's why we didn't opt in ordering entrees.... smart choice, lol! Of yeah, the bread is the bomb! Bottomless! The good and the wierd - we spent the evening checking out the talent (did I mention how cool my friend is! lol!). However, it seems we got bamboozled in our seats because we had to sit near this couple that was being all touchy-feely with eachother.

I had never been to this Cheesecake Factory location before, but I had been to others, and I have never ever had a good experience at The Cheesecake Factory. But a friend was having a birthday party here, so in I went. We had the Spinach and cheese dip as an appetizer. It tasted like they probably got it out of the Frozen food section from Ralph's. Very bland and stock, and meager portion considering the price. I felt like steak, and the only one that was really calling my name was the Filet Mignon. I should have saved that money because the filet was not flavorful, it was not tender, and it was not worth it. I will say they cooked it to proper medium-rare, but other then that, I should have ordered something else.  The problem with this place is evident if you study their menu. It looks like three schizophrenic chefs came up with it. They have Orange Chicken. They have white bean hummus. They have Pizza. They have Chicken and Biscuits. They have steaks. They have a Cuban sandwich. They have to decide what kind of restaurant they are! It is a total mess, they offer hundreds of items and none of them are worth ordering.  Ah, but what about the Cheesecake? Honestly, I have no idea. I think I have been to four different Cheescake Factories, and by the time desert rolls around, I have no faith that they won't screw that up too. Seriously, I only ate half of my filet mignon, the two onion rings and like 10 french fries that came with the steak. And trust me, I am usually a member of the clean plate club. I already felt like I wasted a bunch of money on a disappointing steak, I wasn't going to bother with cake. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Melissa L.,"Costa Mesa, United States",26,137,,4.0,23/11/2010,"Look, haters can hate all they want, but I really like the Cheesecake Factory.   Here's why: 1.  HUGE Menu.  There is something for everyone in your group, or there is something new to try anytime you go.  I am especially liking the 'small plates' section of the menu.  The beets and goat cheese in really good.  (See later comment about this one...) 2.  Competent service.  I don't recall ever going to a Cheesecake Factory and having a completely useless server.  They are friendly and usually very on the ball.   3.  Quality.  Yes they have a giant menu, but the thing is, they get it right.  Food is cooked well and doesn't taste like it just came off the foodservice truck.  (It might have, for all I know, but they do a good job of fooling me if it does.) 4.  The Cheesecake.  I mean, holy God.  My all-time fave is the pumpkin-pecan.  How can this be so good?  If I knew how to make this at home, I would be at least 20 pounds heavier.   Are they overpriced?  Yes.   On a side note, I have gotten the beet and goat cheese small plate in the past and I feel like the one I got on this last trip was waaaay smaller that it has been.  So, I don't know if this is the trend for all of these items, but I hope not.   Also, the BF and I both got burgers on this trip and they were both AWESOME.  I highly recommend the Farm Boy Burger.  Out of control.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=720
J J.,"Westminster, United States",1,80,5,3.0,29/5/2011,"I have been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for years now.  Never had a ""bad"" experience before. In fact, it is usually pretty good. Today, not so much. I am without husband and kids for the weekend (I have to work) so I decided to treat myself to a little shopping (bought stuff for the kids, of course) and brunch. Since I was by myself, I headed to the bar, eager for a glass of champagne, eggs benedict, and reading my book. The bartender greeted me immediately. I asked her what she like and the first thing she said was the benedict with spinach, bacon and tomatoes. I took her suggestion, ordered my champagne and opened my Kindle. Food came out about 10 minutes later.  Potatoes were nice and hot and the eggs were cooked to perfection (I order them poached medium because I don't like them too runny). Only problem was that the were COLD (gross!). I let the bartender know and she was apologetic. She told the manager who also came over to apologize and assured me the next order would be hot.  So about 10 minutes went by and the new plate of food arrives. Potatoes were hot, eggs were warm and way too runny. I chose not to say anything because it really did taste good. Then I noticed that the tomatoes that menu describes as 'grilled' were raw. Again, I chose not to say anything because I like raw tomatoes. I take another bite and realize something is missing. THE BACON!! I bring it to the bartender attention and again she is apologizing. She orders a side of bacon, but by the time I get it, I am almost done and my eggs are cold. I still add it to a few more bites and admit it tasted even better. A little too late, though. The manager comps my meal and the bartender keeps apologizing. But it really is not the end of the world. I enjoyed my food (overall), the champagne was yummy, and I got to eat in peace and quiet without having to tell my kids to hurry up and eat. The bartender gave great service (she deserves 5 stars!) and I felt bad 'complaining'  because I know she was busy. The 3 stars had nothing to do with her - just the kitchen. So with that being said, I know I will be back. I just hope I enjoy my next visit a little bit more.  :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=720

Your having a business lunch, or a first date, or getting dragged along with your group of friends that don't know any better to the CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!  AHHHHHHHH!!!!  I know, I know, it sounds horrible, but trust me, you don't have to cancel your lunch meeting, tell your date your busy washing your hair or spend the night wishing you had smarter friends, but you do have to order smart; considering the menu is like a freaking encyclopedia with advertisements, its not always easy. Make sure to refer to yelp reviews should you start to feel nervous.  I'm no fan of Cheesecake Factory or its sister restaurant Grand Lux Cafe, but I'm also not a fan of being Debbie Downer I cant eat there super snob. Whenever I'm forced to partake at these not so fine establishments, I follow one rule:  Keep it simple  The only things I order here are the guacamole with chips. Shockingly the guacamole is pretty fresh. The Tuna Tataki Salad, the tuna is only lightly seared, and completely pink in the middle, so you know it wasn't bathed in preservatives before taking a months long sabbatical in your restaurants freezer. Not even the wizards behind deep fried macaroni balls have come up with a way to make frozen tuna look fresh......for now. If neither of those options sound appealing just be a fatty and/or a drunk and order deserts and/or drinks only. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is actually pretty good, I think Godiva must hold them to some higher standards.  The one thing you definitely under no circumstances order is the cashew chicken. Once you've eaten it, your committed to tasting it for at least the next 4 days. No amount of tooth brushing, extra strength Listerine, Clorox, oxyclean, engine degreaser, chemical peels, oral ablation or just straight acid will remove that taste from your mouth. Its punishment I think for eating at Cheesecake factory in the first place.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=720

Minerva T.,"Pflugerville, United States",236,331,1844,4.0,31/12/2010,"I like going to Cheesecake Factory but I definitely made a special trip because I read that they had peppermint bark cheesecake in season. It was fantastic! The bread here is always great. I am a sucker for sourdough but have also been won over by the honey wheat they have as well. Their complimentary slices are warm and have great crustiness. The sourdough is not too sour either. If you're a lover of sweeter breads, try the honey wheat. Well actually, since they bring out however much you want, try both! The only problem is that you might get full eating the bread since it's so good - save yourself for all of the food that will come though! To feel fancy, I decided that I'd have myself a cocktail. Now, I'm not a big fan of vodka only because it's pretty much in everything. I mean, I don't hate it - I just don't prefer it, especially if I'm going to pay handsomely for a drink. This cut down my choices on the menu considerably but I did eventually find something to quench my thirst: the Blackjack Martini. It even sounds cool! It was basically a Manhattan with blackberry and Jack Daniel's. I found it quite tasty and hardly noticeable in terms of alcohol taste. My only quibble with this drink was that it was much too expensive. Generally restaurants don't put the prices on the menu for drinks, but from what I've seen, they range from $6-$8 or so at casual-type restaurants. That was my guess. You can imagine my surprise when $11.50 appeared on the bill. I was disappointed in the price and now know not to have a cocktail at Cheesecake Factory again. My friend's Red Raspberry Martini was the same price for a smaller quantity I believe. After much scrutiny of the menu (so many choices), I finally opted for the Bistro Shrimp Pasta dish, which has battered shrimp, mushrooms, tomato, and arugula mixed with spaghettini in a basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce. It came in at $16.95 for the dish, a bit hefty but in the general price range for the pasta dishes. If you ordered this and expected crispy shrimp, you'd be disappointed because the shrimp was a bit soft. I didn't' mind though and actually preferred it; it was more fitting for the dish. I loved the inclusion of the fresh vegetables, especially the arugula. The spaghettini was prepared to just the right texture for pasta - cooked thoroughly but with enough hardness left in it to give you something to chew on; I guess it's what you would call ""al dente,"" or ""to the teeth"" in Italian. I'm a spaghettini and angel hair lover when it comes to noodle-y pastas, so this was a great choice for me. As for the sauce, it definitely made the whole entree worthwhile. I was wary of its advertisement as a cream sauce but the lemon made it light and delicious. I felt like the arugula was complemented well by the garlicky sauce. The portion was too much for me to have but I didn't mind taking it home for some more eating later. The whole reason for going - Peppermint Bark Cheesecake (a white chocolate cheesecake swirled with chunks of chocolate peppermint bark and topped with white chocolate mousse and finished with chopped peppermint). Though we were nearly popping our pants' buttons from the abundance of deliciousness we had, there was room to finish this off. Of course, my two friends and I shared this because we were afraid we wouldn't be able to handle individual slices. It was FANTASTIC. Unlike some of their cheesecakes there (I sure have tried a lot), this one was not too heavy. It's possible that that was an illusion caused by the inclusion of peppermint but either way, it did not make us stop after the first bite. The creaminess of the body was light enough to suggest that it had been whipped up a few times. The chocolate crust had been softened by the slice itself, and I could hardly taste it with all of the mint. I think the topping of the cheesecake with bits of peppermint was great, giving something to break with one's teeth and also to highlight the peppermint swirls in the cheese part itself. My only complaint is that they don't have this cheesecake year-round - I would surely buy it many times!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=720

After looking at the nutritional facts booklet, this has the lowest calories. However, I probably killed myself with the cheesiness.  My friend got the Chipotle chicken pasta. SO GOOD. A hint of spice and a decent amount of peas, chicken, green beans/asparagus, zucchinis. The service was excellent, bread was unlimited, food was fantastic.

Bridgette A.,"San Clemente, United States",81,270,,4.0,16/1/2011,"My hubby and I had a lunch date here today after my class at Corepower yoga. We wanted to watch the end of the NFL playoff game, so we opted to sit at the bar--not IN the bar area, but physically AT the bar. We didn't get any alcoholic bevies, and felt a little bad, but the two bartenders were fabulous and didn't make us feel weird at all. We did get a raspberry lemonade (SUPER tasty but very sweet) and passion fruit iced tea (pretty  much the BEST iced tea I've ever had).  We decided to share 2 lunch specials--the thai pasta and the barbeque ranch chicken salad. The salad was super fresh and cold--tasted delicious on a nice day like today. The pasta was good, but hubby ate it first so by the time I got it, it was more of the bottom of the pasta, and there was too much sauce. I liked the bean sprouts for a nice crunch, tho, and overall it was tasty. The lunch portions were huge! More than enough for a hungry person, and we both left feeling full. Sometimes when you sit at the bar the service sucks, but that was definitely not the case here. The bartenders were great--friendly, attentive, and our food came out quickly. I wish I always got great service like this when sitting at a restaurant bar! We walked out of there with a total of about $35, for lunch for 2 with two non-alcoholic bevies and 2 lunch portions of food... including tax and tip. Not horrible. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because that is reserved for places that are amazing and blow me away--which this did not.

I've eaten here a few times, but have never written a review before. This trip sparked a need to write a review. Our server, Andre, was exceptional, attentive, and happy, but not overbearing.  The only complaints and issues I have are with the food. I ordered the ""Cajun Chicken 'Littles.'"" With a name like that, I expected a few pieces of a spicy breaded friend chicken.  When another server brought out the PLATTER, I was blown away. It was a platter of fried chicken tenders enough to feed 4 people; it was more like a giant appetizer for a table of people. You get your monies worth with the portion size, but the ""cajun"" chicken had no cajun flavor at all. Big thumbs down. KFC chicken has more flavor than the ""Cajun Chicken 'Littles!'""  Even the honey mustard dipping sauce was weak. I love chicken tenders, but I really wanted something with a kick. The mashed potatoes, which they serve without gravy, were also on the bland and boring side, and to top this off the mashed potatoes were COLD. I had to ask the server to bring me another serving which ended up being warmer than the cold mashed potatoes, but not much warmer than room temp. Sad face.

I have to split everything with at least one other person, but mostly everything is tasty and delectable.  My favorite staples are: 1) Chicken Madeira (this dish is WONDERFUL if you substitute Mahi Mahi instead of the chicken). The caramelized sauce tastes delicious with the fish. I usually tell the waitress I want the MAHI MAHI Madeira and they give me this confused look at first .. and then curiosity. Most of them order it to try afterwards, and have told me that this is their new favorite dish here. The downside: sometimes they charge you a lot for the substitution. If you get a nice server, they'll just leave the price as is. 2) BLT Salad. I always substitute the bacon dressing with Ranch dressing.  I'm not a big fan of lettuce, but this salad is surprisingly refreshing. Since its not a heavy salad, but just an appetizer dish, I love splitting this salad and the Mahi Mahi Madeira with my boyfriend. It's the perfect size meal for two.  3) White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake is my favorite dessert here. The others tend to be too rich for me, but this one goes perfectly with some English Breakfast tea.  4) Sangria:  I never thought I'd like the Sangria here. A bunch of us got drinks after a final, and maybe I was delirious from studying, but this Sangria was surprisingly good.  5) Mojito: Doesn't compare to Mercedes Grill at all, but still quite good. Lots of mint,  well done.  Don't Get:  1) California Omelet: bland bland bland. Too thick and dry.  2) Thai Chicken Pasta: go to a Thai restaurant if you want Thai food.

Why am I giving 4-stars to CFHB (Cheesecake Factory Huntington Beach) today? Because I ordered the ""Classic-Original Burger"", and added what I believe make any great burger greater... carmelized onions, fresh avocado slices, and bacon....... in addition to the melted chedder, it came with tomato and lettuce on the side. I added the tomato back in, but didn't add in the lettuce.  The burger meat by itself was at least 1/3 pound, maybe a little more. I ordered my burger medium rare, and it was! PLUS...... CFHB must grill on an open flame grate, because the outside was chared with a wonderful crusty, smoke-char flavor, and the meat tasted like great burger meat. (cheap burgers sometimes don't have any flavor at all).  I'm going to try this again at our local Mission Viejo location. My bet is, if all CF locations follow the same prep and use the same grill, the burger will again rank up there with one of the best I've ever had; mid 80's...... Hamburger Hamlet, Pasadena.

Our party of two didn't have to wait long fortunately.  Also, our waiters were quick and attentive. We each ordered a burger, which comes with your choice of fries or garden salad.  It's still Lent, so I stuck with their portabella on a bun.   Although I enjoyed the burger initially, they blacken the ginormous portabella mushroom so the meld of flavors becomes tiresome 3/4 of the way through.  On the other hand, the kobe beef burger may very well become your new favorite!

The food was delicious though and well worth the wait.  My small salad ($3.95) was actually a good sized ""regular"" serving of salad with 2 freshly cut half slices of tomatoes tossed in their very own vinaigrette.  The lettuce wraps were also giant portion sized and could have fed 3 people so its a good thing we shared this plate.  I love it because they put 3 different sauces (peanut sauce, a thai sauce and some other one I didn't really take a liking to), some noodles, shredded carrots, pickled cucumbers, and grilled chicken teriyaki.  All for you to mix and pick which toppings would like to go inside your wrap.  The lettuce they used for the wraps were big itself and all the condiments and meat fit perfectly inside.  We devoured that thing, it was so good.   Len's jambalaya is on a league of its own.   The shrimp was so juicy and flavorful that I wished I'd gotten his order.  It's my next one to order when I go here again.  Our server, Mike was pretty good about frequenting our table and checking in on us.   It was a shame I didn't get my beloved Tiramisu..almost a sin!  I should get two next time to make up for this.  Try it!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=640
Vic C.,"Duarte, United States",107,2377,8717,4.0,17/1/2012,"I used to come to this particular location often, like maybe every few months, because it is located in the Bella Terra Plaza. This plaza is a great place to go for a nice date night because you can walk around and check out all of the shops, check out a movie and have your pick of restaurants to dine at afterwards.  Well there is more than enough parking here if you choose to eat at The Cheesecake Factory (right next to Barnes and Noble Bookstore). The restaurant is nice and clean, cheesecake slices are deliciously displayed in the bakery case and restrooms are usually clean and adequately stocked. There is plenty of yummy and tasty foods you can choose from to order, salads, sandwiches, soups, pasta dishes, chicken and mashed potatoes, beef and rice, an array of appetizers and starters, etc. One of my most favorite appetizers to order is the Thai lettuce wraps. This a huge platter of food that can feed 4 or more people. You could also make this a full meal for 2 or 3 people. I love the sauces that come with this dish. The chicken is perfectly seasoned, very moist and tender. This is definitely a fun food to order (but can be messy, so maybe not the best dish to order on a first date).  Portions of whatever you order are generally pretty generous so you will leave satisfied and full. And if you are like me, you will probably fill up on the free bread in the beginning of the meal while you wait for your meal. I love that Cheesecake has a skinnylicious menu (but don't be fooled, these items are still pretty high in calories, so don't think these dishes are calorie free) and also a small plates menu (perfect for a nice late night bite). Now on to the cheesecakes! If you love desserts, then you MUST try one of their delectable flavors. I hope to someday try all of the flavors. I especially love the pumpkin cheesecake when it's in season (I like to call ahead of time to see if it's in). There are also noncheesecake desserts, but I have never tried them. I really want to try them, but I always get side tracked by the long list of cheesecakes.  The pricing here is a bit pricey, but I am willing to pay it because the food is so delicious. The service here has been pretty good, but sometimes on occassion, I have found some not so attentive servers. But it wasn't so bad that I wouldn't continue to come back here.  Oh and there is also the Sunday brunch menu you can try. The brunch menu is just okay, I find the omelettes and the hash to be a bit greasy and oily. The waffles are huge and the french toast is really thick and sweet. It's like eating dessert.  And by the way, if you come here for late night eating, just know that the lighting is dimmed. A bit too dark for me though. I prefer to be able to see what I am eating and be able to see my date better. But of course it's dimmed for the atmosphere. I just wished it was a little bit brighter.  Overall, food is excellent, service is usually pretty good and pricing is acceptable. A nice place for a date and has one of the best cheesecakes that's perfect for sharing.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=640

I was told it would be only a few minutes which was fine. As names started to be called we were still waiting. We noticed people coming through the door and were being seated within minutes. I walk up to the podium and tell the girl I've been waiting for 20 minutes and have yet to be seated. She proceeds to tell me someone else must've have got seated when they heard my name. I thought to myself what a lame excuse my name is Courtney, I'm pretty sure I would've heard my own name! Anyway she puts my name in the system about a minute later we were seated at a table where the waiter had yet to pick up the check. Our waiter was Scott he was very nice and attentive.

Our server came immediately, her name was Rachel and she had the sweetest disposition and great smile. Drinks and warm hot bread were served right away. The menu had some great selections and they had a separate menu called Skinnylicious, items were 590 calories or less. I liked that they serve breakfast all day too because sometimes I love breakfast for dinner. We ordered steak and a chicken sandwich, both served with fries(very good) and the steak had onion rings as well. Everything was delicious. Our server kept the water filled and checked on us, still with that great smile. After dinner we ordered cheesecake to go, always so decadent! I was so impressed on a Saturday night that everything went so perfectly. Even the valet parked the car close because we had a bunch of things inside that we were concerned about. $5.00 for valet was cheap and well worth peace of mind.

It's pretty good I like how it had bits of choco crumbs ( or something of the like) which added necessary texture. Sweet, very very sweet.  Brothers had sliders and chicken strips from the kids menu.

We had drinks to relax. Our waitress, bless her heart, was extremely busy...on a Tuesday night...with half the restaurant's tables empty.  She rarely came by, forgot my drink (ok I didnt order because then I would be talking over someone else's order)  AND we had to wait forever for her to run my card. well, I thought they wanted my money.  I did eat after all. Thankfully there were other waitresses from other tables more attentive to me and my party. Now on to the positive side.  I liked the corn fritter, the fried cheese and the strawberry cheesecake.  and that is it...

They bring us food, and one of the dishes is completely wrong.  So the manager comes and says that he will get her's out in 8 minutes and as she waits she could have a free salad (and the entree would be complemented also), so I think O.K.  They are starting to make up for it. 4.  The salad comes out 10 minutes later.  Then the entree comes out about 25 minutes later, after all of us are finished with the meal.   5. We order two desserts, one comes out cold (""hot"" apple crisp) and the other (a cake) is messed up by the same server letting her tie go across the the cake.   6.  Then we get the bill, nothing is taken off, not even the food the manager said he was going to comp.    7.  Ten minutes later, when I am finally able to track down the manager, he comped the things that got messed up.   Overall worst experience I have ever had at any Cheesecake.  I personally will most likely not be going back to this location.  Even Cheesecake Factory in general, to me, has suffered a loss in image because of this.  Left the table not feeling like we as a group had a good time at all.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=620
Stephanie L.,"Bellevue, United States",597,114,55,5.0,2/7/2011,"One of my favorite restaurants! I've NEVER had a bad meal here. I have tried a crazy amount of things on the menu after coming here for so long. The salmon with mashed potatoes, endive low cal salad, several different pasta dishes, all of which were absolutely excellent.  The decor inside is standard Cheesecake factory. Opulent railings and decor that screams for attention in dim settings. The floor walking to the bathroom is always so damn slippery though, so be careful in your stilletos. My only real beef with this cheesecake factory is that it is so ridiculously popular and they dont take reservations. I think i've had to wait every time I've come here, but the wait has never been over 30 minutes for me which is great.

I spotted that immediately! When he brought out my daughter's brownie, he decorated it & spelled her name correctly in chocolate on the plate. He definitely paid attention to wifey! I have never had a problem with Cheesecake Factory, & I would have given 5 stars but settled for 4 stars b/c they do not accept dinner reservations for large parties.

Always making sure we have enough time before the kitchen closes. Even when the kitchen is about to close everything taste just as good as it would if the place just opened. Their only down fall is delivery. When I call in sometimes, they have to put me on hold to transfer over to the bakery. Sometimes they don't even come back so I have to hang up and call back again.

First off, I was a bit weary of visiting this Cheesecake Factory location to begin with.  The last time I visited (a little over a year ago, maybe), my boyfriend at the time received his chicken way, WAY under cooked.  Granted, the manager on duty at the time was very gracious and comped the meal from our bill and made sure he received another order of the chicken done right.   Anyway, I tried to lighten up and give this place another chance and boy, was I wrong in doing so!  I went with my parents and was looking forward to having a nice Easter lunch.  I ordered the lunch special grilled salmon with a side of steamed broccoli.  The dish wasn't bad--I was having a pretty good time until half way through my meal, as I was about to take a huge bite of broccoli, I noticed something strange on my plate.  At first it looked like a piece of broccoli stalk that had been cut or fallen off...  When I took a closer look, I discovered (to my complete and UTTER HORROR) that it was NOT a piece of broccoli at all...but a small, very dead CATERPILLAR (I have pictures as proof)!  Needless to say, I spent the next few minutes pulling an ""Exorcist"" in the bathroom.  The manager DID take what I ordered off the menu and DID give me a gift card, but again, needless to say--I will not be visiting again, thank you very much.

On those latter days, we go to the Cheesecake Factory, where we know we'll get pretty good food at pretty good prices, and the menu is extensive enough to satisfy our undecided palates. So this brief review is more of a comment about the exemplary service we received. Our server, Jennifer T., saw our twin boys being slipped into their high chairs and greeted us with twin plates of sliced bananas. From that point on she ensured that all the little details - including a ""made to order"" pasta dish and club soda for an unfortunate sauce stain - were taken care of in a can-do, unhurried manner; giving us time to enjoy dining out with the boys.

The white rice in my miso salmon was quite undercooked.  It was still very hard. The steak diane (one of my favs) was overcooked. I had ordered medium rare. The medallions came out medium and therefore lost its juiciness. Mashed potato was on point -soft and buttery. Lastly, I had the garlic chicken noodle. Noodle was al dente so no issue there. However, the bf bite into the drumstick and found the chicken undercooked.  I should have taken a picture of it. The chicken inside was between red and borderline pink.  I told the waitress to please tell the chefs that the chicken was not fully cooked.  She took out plates and that was it. No acknowledgement.

My friend offered a pasta dish which she says is way too salty. I try it and agree. When we told the waitress she said someone else at another table said the pasta was very salty as well. The pasta was sent back and taken off the bill. The manager said the pasta water was salty but not the dish.

My 10 year old & I stopped by after the Rose Bowl.  The wait for a table outside wasn't bad.  Unfortunately, when we got to our table outside, we waited for over 10 minutes & no one asked for our drink order.  That's not too long, but the real annoying part was that the waitress went to the table right next to us 4 times in about 10 minutes and never cared to say anything to my son & I. I told the manager & then split to a restaurant next door.  Won't be back to this place.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=20

P R.,"Irvine, United States",0,18,5,2.0,11/1/2018,"My husband and I came here because we got a gift card for Christmas. It had been a while since I had been at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant. They had a long wait and we were given a buzzer. The host was kind but the wait time he told us wasn't close to what we waited. We waited 30 minutes over the time they told us. That's fine. We go to the bar to get a drink while waiting. Bartenders were kind. We finally get called after waiting over an hour. One host takes us to the corner of the restaurant near the exit by the bar and we kindly ask her if we can sit somewhere else and told her we're fine waiting for it. She was very kind about it and said no problem and told us it shouldn't be more than 5 min. We waited until we got called again and this time, the host sat us right next to the bathroom so we sat there and decided that we wanted to enjoy a nice night out together not in the shittiest parts of the restaurant. Our waitress comes up and asks what we'd like to drink and my husband kindly tells her that we would like a different seat and explained our last seating situation. She literally sighed out loud, made a rude face, grabbed our menus and my drink forcefully and says ""well where do you guys wanna sit? Because it's going to be a while"" and doesn't wait for an answer and storms to the front. We follow her and I grab my drink from her and tell her I can hold it myself. She was so unbelievably rude for nothing!!!! We simply asked if we can sit at another table. My husband asked for her name and she said Halley. Still in awe for how she treated us when we KINDLY asked her for another table. We eventually got sat at a great location with a great server and enjoyed our food..except for the dirty silverware that was at our table when they first sat us. Servers/bussers should check the utensils before setting up the tables. Probably won't come here again!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=20

Raychel R.,"Long Beach, United States",39,54,322,5.0,31/7/2017,"Came in for dinner and cheesecake for national cheesecake day! The food was delicious as always and our server Quinn was absolutely amazing. We ordered the Peach Smoothie, Crispy Cuban Rolls, Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club sandwich, and the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta.  The Smoothie was really good especially with the raspberry syrup swirled inside. (Be sure to mix it up before drinking!) The Rolls came with 6 and tasted like mini Cuban sandwiches. The Club was served with fries and I was pleasantly surprised with how moist the chicken was. The Pasta had a nice kick to it and the sauce was very good. As always, the portions at CF are quite hefty, so we ended up getting our half priced slices of cheesecake to go. My bf ordered the classic Strawberry cheesecake, while I ordered the very magical Lemon-Raspberry!!! Nom nom nom.  We also decided to try the new Celebration cheesecake which was ""different"" but tasty nonetheless. It's more cakey with mouse layered in it and I think the cake was funfetti...which is always good in my book.

Lisa V.,"Hacienda Heights, United States",42,12,23,5.0,28/8/2017,"Honestly....""Cheesecake"", any restaurant that has this word in their Title is sure to be a hit with The Ladies So I must admit, there was a point in my life when I was a single mother of 3 that I could not even imagine dining at such a Prestigious Restaurant. In my mind you had to have the Big Bucks to eat there.  That was okay though, I realized I needed to live up to it, and I did. No shame in that. Since I am new to the ""Yelping"" community....lol, I just started about 3 weeks ago to pretty much Give Credit Where Credit is DUE.  That's all.  My husband has been ""Yelping I guess since 2015"" and since he spends hours on his phone posting this and that I figured what the heck, can't beat um...join um.  So here I am and I realized it does make a difference. I don't review establishments for my personal gain as some do....I honestly give my opinion about my ""Experience"".  With that said, I have to admit, The Cheesecake Factory is One of My Top Five choices to dine. I am very picky. I figure if I work hard to earn my income when I do spend it, it should be spent well. I have always believed we as consumers can pretty much have whatever we want....for a price.  Now to my review. I have been to several Cheesecake Factory Restaurants and their service is consistant throughout. More recently My Mother-in-Law have been able to enjoy each others company and we have made several lunch and brunch dates to The Cheesecake Factory.  You can't go wrong.  The building,  the decor, the service, the professionalism of their employees and my favorite,  their incredible freshlu cooked meals are worth every cent. They have an extensive menu, their employees are well groomed,cordial and attentive to their customers.  Their Decor and cleanliness is very appealing as it should be. After a meal, you still have the opportunity to stop by their bakery which has a plithera of cheekcake choices.....If you have a sweettooth or a weakness for Cheeskake.....""Walk Away from the Counter.....slowly""....lol Cheesecake Factory is a must! Bon-appetite! Lisa",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=20

Joeanthony J.,"Houston, United States",103,25,8,1.0,30/3/2017,"To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. We have come to this location numerous times (6+) over the past 5 months that we have lived in Huntington Beach. No visit has been spectacular but we enjoy the large selection that Cheesecake Factory has to offer.  On our last visit, I ordered a jambalaya pasta and the kitchen FORGOT TO OUT SAUCE on the pasta. I didn't bat an eye, mistakes happen. The waiter was less than apologetic and the manager didn't even bother to stop by. Unfortunately, it gets worse.  Last night, we brought some friends visiting from out of town here for dinner. I ordered a dish called ""bang bang chicken & shrimp."" I began eating, dish tasted ok but the flavor was definitely off... I go to take a bite of rice and notice something hard sticking out of my rice once I took a bite. Thinking it was starch from the bottom of the pan, I go to remove it. Much to my surprise IT WAS A HUGE WADDED PIECE OF PLASTIC WRAP. Not only was it disgusting that I had literally just eaten plastic, but it was extremely alarming that I was the first person to see this literally POKING OUT OF MY RICE! You can clearly tell this food is not made fresh daily..... The worst part of the whole experience was the manager who came over and tried to tell me that the plastic wrap was from the kitchen moving the rice from the pot to the plate so it wouldn't stick to the cooks hand. Could be believable EXCEPT IT WAS WADDED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RICE! So, either your manager was lying OR your cook out it there on purpose during the meal prep. Either way, it's disgusting.

I've never been very fond of the service here.  Slow as hell and our waiter/waitress never to be seen after taking our order.  So as usual after taking our order, she completely forgot we asked for straws.  Then we waited over 20 min for her to reappear again so that we can ask for butter, bread, and lemon.  The servers were more helpful with the bread and butter. On to the food.  We ordered the ribeye with mash potato and cream corn, shrimp with angel hair, california omelette, kale salad, and two orders of the portobello, avacodo and zucchini fries.  The appetizers were good.  The kale salad and omelette was loved.  I thought the rib eye was a bit salty and the shrimp was very dry on the angel hair. We again waited for the waitress to come back so we can get togo boxes and check (another 15min)  I guess if you have a lot of time to kill come eat here.  If not I recommend another spot that won't take long.   Overall I only come here with my family other then that I wouldn't dream of coming here lol.  Just too many great restaurants around here to wait and wait for service and pay premium prices for mediocre food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=20

Yum!  Beyond their cheesecakes, I really enjoy their Fresh Strawberry Shortcake as well because its simple and filled with strawberries!

That gives you plenty of time to enjoy Bella Terra's many stores, shops, and all kinds of wonderful places in Bella Terra.  Once you get a table the service is great. The waiters are fast and friendly.  As you order, if your eating as a family I recommend sharing food by ordering a pasta, salad, and one or two entrées, since the portions are huge.  If your eating with friends or coworkers, stay away from very heavy and rich foods since you most likely can't finish.  For dessert you have tons of cheesecake to choose from, I recommend the Godiva cheesecake for any chocolate lovers.  Overall a spectacular place to spend the evening to have dinner.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=780

There are Cheesecake Factories all over the US but this was the first Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. I know. Shame on me.  This place is set up like a restaurant. There's a waiter to seat you in the front and give you menus. I always thought this place served only desserts but they actually served all kinds of food from salmon to salads and sandwiches. It wasn't any Cheesecake Factory after all but now I'm being a smarta$$. haha I ordered  a salad and a plain cheesecake. The salad was Huge like all food orders in California are and the cheesecake was super rich. I never thought I can cheesecake so rich and savory but this more than hit the spot. It was also super moist but the only problem is it was difficult to eat the whole slice at once because of it savoriness.  I had business to attend to afterwards but I can definitely see myself returning here to try the rest of their desserts.

Danielle T.,"San Francisco, United States",43,17,,4.0,11/8/2010,"I know it's a chain, but my experiences at Cheesecake Factory have been quite good.  The thing I don't like about it is that for an indecisive person like me,  their menu is way too broad.  On the other hand, there should be something on the menu to appeal to everyone.   Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - It is their most popular pasta dish for a reason.  Shrimp and chicken over linguine with a mildly-spicy, cajun sauce.   Chinese Chicken Salad - It's freaking huge! I don't believe I've ever finished it.  Quite possibly the best chinese chicken salad ever.   One of my favorites things about dining at Cheesecake is their complimentary pumpernickel (my fave) and french bread! For me, it's a toss-up between them and Macaroni Grill's rosemary bread as best free bread at a chain restaurant.  I don't think I can ever leave this place without order a slice of cheesecake.  I recommend the tiramisu cheesecake or the red velvet cake cheesecake.  Be warned that a slice of the latter is double the price of a slice of any other cheesecake but it is damn worth it.  It is extremely rich so I suggest sharing, and between 2 people, is almost a meal in itself.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=780

I came here a few years ago and never came back again until a friend of mines did her birthday dinner here recently. I had a bad experience here because they had the worst fettuccine alfredo. EVER. How the hell could you go wrong with a typical pasta? Apparently, they do. Anyways, onto the good stuff. I returned here for a friend's birthday. I love how they give out complimentary breads and butter. Keeps my mouth entertained until my dinner comes out. Don't eat too much of it though! Last time i got carried away and got full off of it -_-. But i love coming here even for their bread baskets. Most places would taste bland and give out old bread but this place is legit. The bread baskets comes in white or wheat bread. The wheat bread is so good that I even request only wheat bread now. They even toast it for you too and it tastes even better because the butter would just melt onto it. Wow I didn't realize I wrote alot just for their complimentary breads lol =X  So, I had their Louisiana Pasta. It is so good. One of the best pastas I've had. I think it was a bow-tie pasta with some thick cream sauce and Cajun seasoning all over. it came with fried hand breaded chicken. Most places  would disgust me by over doing it with the batter and deep fry it but here, it was super thin battered and you can actually taste the chicken, I thought it would be dry but it was juicy! Loved it. I'd come back here again for that =)  I had their Salisbury Steak entree for dinner here too before. They give out a big portion of it. It came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was under $15 too! and It was very good and filling. Their Caesar salad is actually pretty bomb. I had a side order of that and Mac and cheese. the mac and cheese noodle was pretty big and they used lots of cheese. I love cheese.

But not to get ahead of myself, the non-cheesecake items are also really, really good. The menu is HUGE...strangely full of advertisements for other consumer establishments.  Started things off with the fire roasted artichoke which was pretty good. Had the Rib-Eye Steak Cajun style for my main course. Ordered it medium rare and it literally melted in my mouth. It was seasoned perfectly so there was no need for any A-1 (if it's seasoned and cooked properly, a cut of steak...especially a rib-eye doesn't need any fixin's like A-1 or BBQ). It was honestly the best piece of meat I have ever had from a chain restaurant. This rib-eye comes runner up to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in Vegas for best steak I have ever had.  Then there was the cheesecake...with maybe 30 to choose from I decided to check out the cookie dough cheesecake. I couldn't finish the whole thing and I do love me some cheesecake. Very rich and definitely worth the calories as a mega sweet treat.  The staff was on point with good service and the decor was quite interesting. A lot of brightly colored hand-blown glass work which I could only imagine is really cool looking at night.  I will be back for sure...maybe on a date night with the girlfriend...and I hear the wait for dinner can be really really long...so I think reservations are a must.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=800
James J.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,5,1,1.0,17/7/2014,"Ok so we went to The Cheesecake factory this weekend and had the typical herding cattle experience, but this time the food was subpar. I ordered catfish and it lacked taste and was chew, but was alright. My wife ordered the fettuccini alfredo. The pasta and sauce was delicious, but she added chicken (a $3 charge) and it tasted and looked like it was boiled and not seasoned at all. At most restaurants when you add chicken to something the pasta will come out with a nicely grilled and seasoned chicken breast sliced and laying on top. This chicken was in odd chunks of all sizes and thrown haphazardly on top. It tasted bland. The first bite that she took she spit back out because it had a large piece of gristle in it. After that she didn't even eat the chicken. So we paid $3 extra for something that she couldn't even stomach. I'm hoping it was just an off night because in the past the food has been what has saved this place in my eyes.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=800

Patric T.,"Westminster, United States",0,22,1,2.0,9/7/2014,"What a difference. Until today, this Cheesecake Factory location has been the ""go to"" restaurant whenever we have friends in town or just want an extraordinary meal and are willing to pay the high prices. I treated my wife to a birthday dinner and expected the same great-tasting food and attentive service as we've always enjoyed in the past. There seems to be a pall hovering over restaurants these days and the Cheesecake Factory seems to be its latest victim. We were seated soon and were led to a table whose waitress, at first, was attentive but then became less so as the meal went on. She pasted a phony smile on her face but she wasn't concerned much on getting our order or visiting our table during the meal. She ran through the ""specials"" as if she was giving a post-mortem account of how someone died. Asking for an additional round of bread was almost painful as, after I did, she gave me the look like, 'really'?  But what really caused us grief was the quality and condition of the food once if finally came. I don't mind waiting for hot and freshly cooked food, but when it comes out looking as if the chef's couldn't care less if it had any appeal, well, something's gone wrong. I ordered the Spicy Sesame Chicken and my wife, the Chicken Marsala. Let's start with mine. The chicken was cooked as I expected but, the brown rice was slathered in the sesame sauce, so much so that the rice was packed down and the sauce was floating in the dish. On the contrary, my wife's meal had little to almost no Marsala wine as part of the meal. She kept scraping the chicken on the dish hoping to gather some flavor. Our now largely missing-in-action waitress (she was not the euphemistic ""server"") came by only to re-fill our sodas and never inquired about our meal. Could I have spoken up? Of course and maybe I should have. I actually should have sent the food back and left. But we didn't want the reason we went there to be lost and we finished our meals. ""Did you leave room for dessert"" came the expected question from our waitress. ""No, sorry.""  Needless to say, her tip reflected not only her lousy service but the manner in which our food was prepared. Reading other reviews, I am not alone in my disappointment regarding our visit to Huntington Beach location of the Cheesecake Factory.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=800
A Y.,"Glendale, United States",16,238,14,4.0,24/2/2010,"Often times I dislike giving chains 4 stars. Everything just feels so un-original and uniform... McD's comes to mind, doesn't it? However, Cheesecake hasn't done anything wrong to warrant anything less than 4 stars, so I'll simply have to squash that feeling until I can find something to nitpick on. Cheesecake Factory is always a good time, mainly because the food is always good. And who doesn't like a nice looking restaurant? All the food I've tried is amazing, and each new dish only gets better. Wish the price is a bit lower, but I do feel like I get what I paid for.

We waited to be sat in the dinning room but then were walked to be sat in the corner of the bar. We were in a booth so we thought...ugh...this isn't that bad! Well...we sat for a while and after hearing a full conversation with our server and the host which included him stating that he did not know why he was being sat and that if he could please not be sat anymore he would greatly appreciate it...he said hello. He told us he was having a horrible night and couldn't wait to get out of there and being a server myself through college know exactly what he was talking about but in the customer service industry I do not think it is at all appropriate to communicate this fact with your client!! So...the night did not get any better. My husband was hungry and I wasn't sure what I wanted yet so I told him to order...but clearly held on to the menu to order in just a bit. He never came back and because we were in the corner no one walked by...my initial reaction was to chase someone down but my husband is a bit more reserved and asked that stay put! So my husbands food came...I shared because I was hungry too! His food was done...I finally then got my glass of wine I ordered. Never were asked how everything was...then  my husband had to ask for the check and he dropped it off and walked away. That was it! I never got any food...or even had the opportunity to order.

Really??? We ended up just moving ourselves to another table where she did serve us because it was still in her area.  In the interest of service, she should have welcomed us to make the change and if the hostess needed to know that we moved, she could have told her.  Also, she wasn't very attentive to our needs during our time there.

He came and asked if we needed something.  He took care of our requests, he was pleasant, welcoming and could have taught our server a thing or two about customer service.  This isn't our first visit to your location.  Let's just say that we come there for the product (cheescake), definitely not the service.  Overall, we need to get back to true customer service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=820

This location, in particular, is always packed full of people. Expect to wait. The outdoor patio wouldn't be so bad if it weren't right next to the street; you get a lot of car exhaust blown at you. My recommended method of attack is to drop somebody off at the door who can put your name in, then go park your car in the multi-level parking structure.

Well my 1st time ever at a Cheesecake Factory was a total MISS I was soo disappointed.... And soo as I walk in they were able To seat us within 2-4 min, not bad ... The menu was a little overwhelming so I asked are waitress to come back in a few.. I didn't mean 15 min later... So we then ordered .. 2 couples sat down on each side of us , ordered and  ate there food before we even got ours .. So 3 baskets of bread later the waitress came to us realizing it's been over a 1/2 hour and apologized and brought us complimentary bowl of soup and more bread !! Yeahh ( being a smart ass ) and then said  she will be back with drink since our glasses have been empty for at least 10min . But still kept bring us bread . Then are food finally arrived .. Ohh my soo disappointed it taste sooo bad .. I got Evelyn's fav .. Well it was pasta noodles that tasted straight from  the boiling water NO FLAVOR AT ALL .. The eggplant was like rubber, mayb because it was cooked for over 40 min idk .. And the whole 2 small pieces of artichoke .. I was soo bummed .. But the time I filled up on bread and soup with nothing to drink and a crappy  flavorless plate and the over hour being there I just wanted to leave - and I missed the best part getting a slice of cheesecake to go ..

Christina O.,"Garden Grove, United States",134,22,10,1.0,20/8/2014,"Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite places to eat but now it's not so great. I notice this about a lot of food chain restaurants that are at first successful and then they become almost sluggish and careless. The food quality is not as great, and the service was almost nonexistent. But hey, people will still come to Cheesecake Factory no matter what, food is decent for price you pay for and it's a nice place to dine in without going anywhere too expensive. Now I never have a problem when I eat here, in fact the customer service is usually great the past couple times I've been here. I was here on Tuesday around 2-3pm (don't exactly remember the time). Me and my boyfriend decided to eat outside since it was pretty cold inside with the ac. Our server's name was Lori-Ellen. When she came to take our order she didn't even smile or greet us, she just asked us if we were ready to order. We got the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and fried calamari. What bothered me the most was when she came to bring us the food. She literally dropped off the plate on the corner of the table and left. Um hello?? It'd be nice if you left it in the center of the table for us to eat? Seriously..when she did that with the calamari and came back with the jambalaya, she did the same thing twice. Oh and the extra plates she brought us, the top one was dirty, I don't know why she thought we wouldn't notice that large stain on the dishes she handled us, but I guess she's TOO busy to check if they're clean before she gives them out. We actually told a different server who was working outside as well for a clean plate and she was a lot more friendlier. It was not even busy outside at all, it was just two other tables and us. She checked up on us once. Couldn't find her anywhere, we had to ask a busser for a different sauce for the calamari, he was really nice and helpful, brought it out quick. I wish I knew his name, I'm pretty sure he'd be a way better server than the one we had.  It took forever for her to come outside, we were waiting to ask for the check, ended up waiting for like 15-20mins. I don't know where she disappeared off to. She just seemed lazy about her job and didn't really care much about providing great customer service, please act like you like working there a bit more or don't even work there at all. She also seemed careless about taking the dirty plates off, I don't want to exaggerate and say she slammed the plates together, but it did seem kind of rude to make so much noise clearing plates off our table.I've been a server too so I know what looks acceptable and what doesn't as a server.  Things like this don't usually bother me that much, but I've never have a bad experience like this the other times I've dined, I probably won't be back for a while. We probably just had a bad server but meh, I'll think twice about eating here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=500

I've never been a fan of CF since in most of my experiences the food is pretty mediocre but hey, I'm willing to give it another chance. I haven't been in years since they baked wax paper in my pizza crust.  This location is beautiful inside. Marble everywhere and spotless. Our waitress Veronica was excellent. She was informative, had a great sense of humor, and was extremely friendly.  Bread basket here comes with squaw and french bread.  Both tasted very fresh.  My wife and I loved the squaw bread and were fighting over slices.   After perusing the giant menu of both food and advertisements I was strongly drawn to the crispy beef stir fry..... sounded delicious and I've had it before. When it was my turn to order for some reason I didn't order what I was craving.... out of my mouth came ""green chile cheeseburger"". Why I ordered this I have no clue but it was pretty disappointing. The burger should of been very tasty but it was so bland and boring. The ground beef had no flavor, the cheese had zero flavor, as did the thimble size portion of pico de gallo (had to ask for more). I was hoping for an ortega chile but it was just a few slices of pickled jalapeno. I felt bored and kept thinking ""Why the eff didn't I order what I was craving????"". Fries on the other hand were crispy and hot. I dipped them in BBQ sauce and they were very good.  My wife's entree was excellent. I had a few bites and was very envious. She had the ""Vietnamese Caramel Chicken"". Holy shyte was this good. Chunks of chicken fried crispy in a thick golden batter tossed with green beans, onions, shitake mushrooms, sweet red peppers, in a spicy and sweet sauce. It was excellent and for $12.95 a great deal given the portion and quality. It was on a specials menu so not sure how long they'll have it for but I'd come back for it.

I have a thing for cheesecake (plain/ny style) and have tried a good amount of them from different places. It's my favorite dessert. One would expect cheesecake from cheesecake factory to be top notch cheesecake, but it's not. In fact, NY style cheesecake from my local pavilions bakery and honey baked ham, are vastly superior. First off, the cheesecake filling is very goopy, and has the consistency of pre-made filling cheesecake. Quality cheesecake is very dense, enough to stick a metal fork in. It wasn't. Also good cheesecake has a thicker outer skin, and a golden bronze color on the top. Didn't have either. The crust also sucked, and it's not as tall as NY style cheesecake is supposed to be. Price was a little steep. Was $7 per slice, and still not as good as a $4 slice from modest bakeries.  Of course the selection of cheesecake was very good. And maybe other varieties are better, but I doubt it.

Samantha T.,"Westminster, United States",61,76,1,3.0,11/7/2011,"So I was craving for some Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake and decided to go to this one since it's closest to home. I get there around 8:35pm, TODAY. Parking is a b*tch there, but anyways I walk straight to the bakery. No one greets me as I was gazing across the fridge full of cheesecake. Then the worker with glasses and curly hair told me to wait. I understand that the workers should take care of the dine-in customers first, but after she was done with it, she still didn't take my order and started to clean the work area. I saw two other people waiting there before me. I stood there for a good 15 minutes and I got fed up. All I wanted was a freakin slice of cheesecake. I didn't think it would take so long! All she could've done was at least take my order, cut out a slice, put it in a dam box and hand it to me, and I would be happy. I don't even need the whip cream nor a freakin bag for it. I've dine here 2-3 times. But first time ordering at the bakery. Honestly, I would not come back to this place. I'd rather drive to Irvine Spectrum for a piece of freakin cheesecake, which I'll probably do NOW.. Now I understand why my boss always tells me to stop at whatever I'm doing, always greet a customer and take their order right when they come in. As I thought about it, maybe I just happened to come at the wrong time on the wrong day. I would come back since it's the CLOSEST one to me.Dining in, I still have no problem. And since my boyfriend went in to get it for me, there wasn't a long wait this time. Though I did call in THIS TIME to order ahead of time.

Customer service:  5 stars Food: 4 stars When i called on New Year's Day to find out if the restaurant was open, the person answering the phone was friendly and helpful. We arrived about 7:30pm expecting to wait well over an hour for a holiday, but instead we were told it would only be 35-40 minutes.  How pleased we were when our buzzer vibrated after 15-20 minutes!   Several people attended to us (menus, set-ups, water, bread, and ordering) quickly without being pushy.  We had two food servers, Shelby and Ashley, who were wonderful.  When one was scheduled for a brief break, she brought the other over to introduce us and to make sure we knew what to expect.  This is what customer service is all about.  These two women were pleasant and professional.   Sometimes my husband and I feel cheated because quality service seems to be a thing of the past.  This was not the case on New Year's.  The food at the HB Cheesecake Factory was plentiful and tasty, however, the customer service at this location is why we would return.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=840

Ethan H.,"Santa Ana, United States",1,10,,1.0,16/2/2009,"God, I fucking hate this place. For one, it literally took me half an hour to find a parking spot. I circled the lot outside Barnes and Noble for a good twenty minutes, dodging crazy Bella Terra-ers and their huge fucking SUVs and people who think the road is a sidewalk, before FINALLY driving all the way back to the structure to park on the second floor. And it was raining. Second, WHY ARE THERE SO MANY DAMN ITEMS ON THE MENU? It was like I was reading a cookbook. How many different salads and pastas can you possibly make? I decided to pick the basic soup and salad (because it was lunch) for fear of the chef forgetting to make what I ordered. The (garlic) caesar salad was more garlic than caesar, and my soup that looked like beef stew was mediocre. Towards the end, it felt like I was eating soil. The meat had a weird texture that settled on the bottom. At least our server was fast and a bit friendly, unlike other experiences I've had at this same location.

The only downside is that the parking right by the Cheesecake Factory is a 2 hour limit, but there is a parking garage over by the movie theaters, and if you're there for dinner and a movie, or shopping, parking there isn't too bad.

Benjamin B.,"Long Beach, United States",0,2,,5.0,14/6/2014,"I'm writing this review for 6/12/14 Thursday night. First off, I gotta say if you don't valet your car then you're missing out, but that isn't a part of The Cheesecake Factory. So my girlfriend and I got there and immediately I checked in and the host told me 10-15 minutes for a party of two. As soon as I got the pager, I turned around to wait outside, but I only made it to the door and the pager went off. I saw they printed out my name with a table number on it and I was like wow that was fast. I overheard a party of 5 would take 30-45 minutes to be seated. These hosts were awesome and I think that hosts are under appreciated in the restaurant business. So we sit down at our 2 top table and it's a little small and usually I would have asked for a booth, but on a busy night, I was lucky to get a table as fact as I did, so I wasn't about to ask to move. Our server was Kenny and he was great. I ordered 2 waters and an ultimate margarita for my girlfriend and I. Kenny brought them along with the bread. I took a drink of my Ultimate Margarita and it was too sweet, so I stirred it a bit, but it was still too sweet (wasn't his fault maybe the bartender messed up or CF's recipe uses alot of sweet and sour). So when Kenny came around I told him that my margarita had too much sweet and sour and that I wanted to get a mojito instead and it was delicious. Then we ordered our appetizers, spinach dip and potstickers, and our meal at the same time, Meatloaf and Chicken Madeira, the only problem with the appetizers was that the spinach dip was too cold, so I asked Kenny to heat it up abit and he did, easy fix. The manager came around as our food came out to apologize about the wait. My girlfriend and I didn't even notice the wait. I saved room for dessert and Kenny packed up all our leftovers for us and even gave us great recommendations for dessert. We were full so we decided to order our dessert to-go and eat it when we got home. We got the Kahlua cheesecake and the reese cup cheesecake for our roommates. Kenny brought our check and we had about $88 and 20% is about $17-$18, but we didn't want to break any bills, so we left him $110. That's $22 tip.  To you cheapsakes out there! That's how you tip properly, so take a lesson. Our service was sublime nothing to really complain about, so to those people that find a problem every time. Get over yourself. Maybe the reason you have bad costumer service everywhere you go is because you're a bad customer. Lastly, to Nancy L. who said that the hostess greeted her without a smile. Get over yourself. not everything revolves around you. Let's change the way we treat the service industry. Lastly, I'd like to thank Kenny for providing us with great service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=560

Their strawberry lemonade is always delicious and I love the sugar they put around the rim and the glasses are so big! For an appetizer I ordered the vietnamese tacos which are to die for!!!! And the hubby got some sort of corn cakes or something that were also really good. For lunch I ordered the same thing I get every time I come here! The Luau Salad!!!

Bud G.,"Long Beach, United States",0,102,,2.0,12/10/2014,"For me: 2 STARS For my eating companions (in their opinion, of course): 3-4 STARS Let me preface this specific review that I've NEVER had a Cheesecake Factory experience that made me want to go back. To me it's the ultimate in big, mediocre corporate food and my meals have always disappointed me in one way or another.  It may be my curse, because  it seems that other people I'm with (usually) have better experiences (and I understand why), but I seem to always come out going ""meh."" Maybe I just keep ordering the wrong thing, even though it's a different wrong thing each time. So, why do I keep going back?  Honestly, the only reason I show up to CF is because I have to: I'm with a group of friends and/or relatives and/or business acquaintances who want to eat there and I'm not in a position to argue the point. When it's someone's birthday and that's where they want to eat, you go with the flow, no matter how painful.  I'm giving it 2 STARS on today's visit for these reasons: The waiter, while friendly, was sparse in his attention. We had to flag down other waiters to get stuff or wait for a while to see him to flag him down.  The bread was OK, though I'm not a fan of the dark/squaw (or whatever it is) bread, and the sourdough was a bit on the tough side.  My dish was the White chicken chili.  Almost 14 bucks. The menu actually starts out with the description of this dish saying ""A generous bowl of..."" The waiter asks me if I want white rice or brown with that. I say brown, but it matters not, because the rice ended up being what amounted to a tablespoon in about a cup's worth of chili that barely took up the bottom third of this huge bowl that it was brought in. So, yeah, as the menu said, the bowl was indeed generous. However, the contents were not. Really, 14 bucks for this? The rest of my party either laughed or felt sorry for me when they saw that my dish was actually much smaller than the kid's meal that one of the kids in our party had. My partner actually called the waiter over and asked him if this was a mistake. He said no, that's the serving size and walked away.  OK, well, I'll just eat bread to fill up, I guess... As far as the chili itself, it was very, well, OK. Mediocre. Kind of watery, about a tablespoon of rice, a few pieces of chicken, a few beans and nothing about the flavor to distinguish it from, say, a mediocre chicken tortilla soup from a diner.  Anyway, the cheesecakes were OK, but cheesecake doesn't blow me away, so once again, another weak experience.  However, I know, deep in my heart, that one day I'm going to have to come back here again, like it or not.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=560

Additionally, we ordered the calamari appetizer which was undercooked. My husbands draft beer came to the table after the undercooked calamari. The manager did bring out a new calamari, but not until we were almost finished with our main course. During college, I worked in a very busy restaurant.

Came with the in-laws on this particular visit for my husband's bday and we had... *Lots of brown (wheat) bread - thanks to the waitress for actually bringing us only brown bread as requested (seriously, brown bread is way better than the white bread) *Avocado eggrolls - I'm hooked *Kale salad (from the ""small bites"" menu) - decent. Forgot to ask for the dressing on the side, and it felt like the pieces of kale hadn't been cut up as usual *Fresh artichoke - my sister-in-law ordered it and I had actually never had artichoke like this... surprisingly tasty, though a little more hands-on than I like my food *Chicken bellagio - my husband's favorite  *Filet mignon - FIL thought it was really good *Veggie burger - sis-in-law is also a vegetarian (pesc?) and didn't like this *Strawberry shortcake - ate too much of the biscuit and ice cream... but it's seriously my favorite dessert. Desserts are the #1 reason why I fail (repeatedly) as a vegan *Tiramisu cheesecake - my husband loves tiramisu... and cheesecake. So this is pretty much as good as it gets for him!

You can do all of the above at Cheesecake Factory. Portions on the regular menu are ample, particularly the yummy salads. I always have at least a third of my meal to take in a doggie bag. The tastes border on gourmet; every dish, of the 15 or so I've had, is elegantly presented and gives your taste buds an adventure. Watching your calories? There's a special menu with exact counts, some under about 500 calories, some under 600-650; all of these, 20 or more choices, have the same chef's flavors with lighter ingredients and smaller portions. The only drawback is really a testimonial to the restaurant's great quality: you may have to wait 1/2 hour or more to be seated at mealtimes, particularly weekends. Just call ahead.

Stephen D.,"Irvine, United States",533,19,15,1.0,17/4/2010,I ordered the Fettuccine with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes on 4/16/10 @ 1pm from the Huntington Beach.

Sherin T.,"Oceanside, United States",95,16,5,2.0,5/1/2011,"I normally love the cheesecake factory, and have been there several times however this experience was by the far worst I've had. Our server, Kaitlyn, was unpleasant from the start. She approached our table with a nonchalant mood and progressively got worse. One side cesar salad never came out and we assumed this was just a mistake on the kitchens behalf but thought nothing of it. Then all of our entrees came out except the entree that was for the girl with the cesar salad. Since i work in the food industry i immediately thought that this seemed as though Kaitlyn forgot to put that girls entire order in. After 10 minutes she finally noticed and then ran to the kitchen. A manager came over with a fake lie and said the food would be right up. Worst of all the server never apologized. Only thing they did right was comp the salad. No compliments to the service this time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=880
Christopher M.,"Long Beach, United States",235,405,252,2.0,10/7/2008,"Been to a lot of the other Cheesecake factory locations in Southern California, and the one in Vegas (even their sister restaurant in the Venetian - forget the name). It's usually pleasant, food is pretty good in general. Hosts are slightly aloof, but most servers are cordial and accommodating.  We've eaten at the HB one a couple times due to its close proximity.This location is lacking something though.  Maybe its due to the area - it's next to a bookstore, in a shopping plaza. I know other ones are in malls and such, but this feels almost strip mall-ish. The ambience that other spots have (Redondo Beach, Marina del Rey) is lacking here.  In addition every time we have eaten here they have messed up our orders. One request: no onions. And every time we get our food - onions. At least we got free cheesecake out of it. Hmm, maybe I'm on to something.... Anyway, some highlights on the menu. Avocado eggrolls are great, as is Miso Salmon and Bistro Shrimp pasta. Tuxedo cheesecake is a favorite of mine, but most ppl go for Dulce de Leche or White Chocolate Raspberry. Hard to go wrong with the dessert menu though, most of it is tasty.

Mindy H.,"Irvine, United States",419,324,291,2.0,26/6/2008,"UGH.  This cheesecake factory will forever tarnish the squeaky clean image of other cheesecake factories for me. It wasn't the service that was appalling. . .it was their food.  As always, their service is accommodating, swift, and professional.  However, it was seriously the food that was atrocious. For one, I ordered the iced green tea which was beyond pepperminty, I felt like I was inhaling pure peppermint essence.  And if ya'll know (I know the ladies know this) but peppermint is known to suppress the appetite. . .but boy did it do more than that.  I totally lost it. Those of you that know me. . .(and none of you don't) know that I eat A LOT.  I can totally out-eat my friend. . .and he has a healthy appetite.  I can literally eat ALL the bread they give you, plus my entree and maybe squeeze in some dessert. . .but after the gross iced tea, I sat there pouting, waiting for redemption to come. It never did. I ordered the miso salmon (lunch portion) on a bed of spinach instead of rice.  What I love about Cheesecake is that they love to accommodate you, and will substitute almost anything for you.  Instead, what I got was this watery mess. . .it was like they forgot to drain my spinach or something.  On top of THAT, my miso was more of a sauce than its usual paste.  It's like they just took a hose and watered down my meal. . .it was tasteless and SOGGY and totally gross.  Needless to say, after two bites, I was done with it.  It totally ruined my appetite for the ENTIRE day (okay fine, so I was attacking my bf's pantry a few hours later.. .but STILL, I would've polished that baby off!!!) I was so disappointed, even shopping couldn't cheer me up. . .and spending money ALWAYS cheers me up =( (BTW my friend got the ranch house burger and LOVED it.  In addition to pieces of steak, it comes with a giant meat patty, bacon, onions, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and fries.)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=880
Ann B.,"Huntington Beach, United States",15,31,1,3.0,26/11/2007,"After last night's dinner, I absolutely felt compelled to write a review...in large part, due to the poor service by waitress, V. I was there to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our party consisted of nine people, so the 18% gratuity tip is a given but she certainly did not deserve it. -we requested for more of that sweetened honey bread, but she did not bring it to us. never once did she look over to our table. we had to wait until we received our main courses to put in another request to another server. -some of our water mugs were completely empty. she was refilling customers at other tables. if it weren't for one of us grabbing her attention, she would've walked the other way without giving us refills. -additionally, we had to request for a dessert menu. what is the cheesecake factory if they don't offer you cheesecake? -lastly, when she separated our checks, one of my friends bill showed  more than a 90% tip. Granted, mistakes happen, but this just shows how she overlooked us and provided incredibly poor service. Her positives... -she did gather a group of coworkers to present the birthday sundae and sing to my friend -she was right with her recommendation to my friend who questioned which dish would be more filling for him. Food-wise...I was pleased. My friend and I shared the ""Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic."" We are girls, and the amount was just right for the two of us. It is my new favorite dish at this restaurant. You can't go wrong with ""Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Carmelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce. "" We also tried the ""Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake"" for the first time. It is lighter cheesecake, but it tasted very much like a lemon-flavored starburst.  In the past... -Louisiana Chicken Pasta (The chicken is the best part. It has a nicely breaded, crispy crust. The pasta, on the other hand, was lacking in the flavor department.) -Crispy Spicy Beef (The breaded, crispy beef is very good as well. The only thing is that it is not good as leftovers. I really like that this dish comes with vegetables; however, it can be overpowered because it is completely dowsed with the teriyaki-like sauce. I have had hit and misses with the rice; one time it was very dry and not completely cooked.) -Fried Macaroni and Cheese (ball of breaded mac and cheese that is very rich and creamy. It is served with marinara sauce. It is only good immediately after being served. Otherwise, it starts getting cold and doesn't taste good anymore) -Fried Calamari (Decent, nothing great. A bit oily as well) My recommended cheesecakes -Fresh Strawberry -Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake -Chocolate Tuxedo Cream -Fresh Banana Cream My borderline Cheesecakes -Tiramisu (good if you really like coffee) -Godiva Chocolate (very very...VERY rich) -Lemon Raspberry Cream (very fruity) -White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle (okay, but not to my liking) Last night was more of a miss on service; however, we did get seated within 5-10 minutes (we arrived around 8:30pm on a Sunday night).

They have a new pizza on the menu, pear, blue cheese and pecan, sounds different so I go for it. The pizza was actually delicious and I would go again just to have this one dish. The pear was perfectly cooked, the pecans added a nice crunch and the blue cheese was mellow adding a nice, simple flavor to the pizza. I would go back just to have this dish. My husband ordered the small mushroom pizza and it was delicious as well. Neither pizza was dripping in greasy cheese and I love that. We ordered edamame to start and with the pizza it was the perfect light dinner. We experienced no wait about 7:15 p.m. on a Saturday night, and the service was very good, friendly and quick.

Like put an adult cheese in them.. gouda or something. Good but not great.  For lunch I had the gumbo. Not bad at all for a non-southern restaurant but I ordered it without shrimp and the waitress totally blew this. As a matter of fact, she blew the whole meal. I asked her what was ""New Orleans Sauce"" per the menu which was used in the description of a pasta dish.. Her answer was.. ""it sauce in New Orleans"" to which I asked her if it was anything like ""Long Beach sauce"". She is probably still trying to figure that one out. She failed! She should know basic menu items. And she blew the shrimp order. My guest ordered chicken tenders - called Cajun Bites but there was no spice to them at all.

Even if they are constantly running around, they always stop by to ask if you need anything several times. - They give you a buzzer so you can browse the shops in the mall while you wait to be seated.  CONS: - There is usually a wait on nights and weekends that can last more than 1 hr. I don't go here for regular meals because I can't afford the time to wait.

Lunch for 4 people was $140. Food was ok, service was ok, drinks were ok, but not a hundred and forty friggen dollars ok.  Also, after we finished eating and paid, I stopped into the bakery to pick up a cheesecake my mom had requested. Sure, no problem, they charged my card, I stood around for 10 minutes until a manager told me they didn't have the kind I wanted. They refunded my card and gave me a slice of what they did have for free, so ok,,fine. Although I don't know if the free slice of cheesecake was intentional or not, either way, after a $40 per person after tax/tip meal, I'll take my $7 slice free, thanks.  Bottom line, for mediocre food, I'll go elsewhere. For cheesecake, I'll go to Costco.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=700

Eugine Y.,"Westminster, United States",423,310,141,3.0,11/9/2009,"Any place that sings ""happy birthday to you"" on the day that commemorates your birth automatically sucks, but you already knew that.  It's situated in the otherwise useless Bella Terra. You've seen their menus right?  Them s#its remind me the of Nascar with all their sponsors and whatnot on/in them.  You can't frickin' turn a page in their catalogue of a menu without seeing an ad for diamond rings or gazebos to put in your backyard or even ads for a realtor that I'm sure isn't making a dime nowadays. How'd I end up here?  Well, after hours of deliberation my senses and I were completely watered down, so we ended up here.  This what happens when it's late and all your other go-to joints are closed for the night.  Don't get me wrong.  I've frequented CCF's, but they're never my first choice.  Although, nothing I've had is bad, nothing I've had turns me on to the point where I have had to adjust my pants in the crotch region to make room for a you-know-what ;) Our server this last time was Jeff.  Yes, Jeff with his style-at-the-time emo hair cut was quite the friendly and upbeat fellow.  So friendly it was downright annoying.   So friendly I wanted to take my fist to his face.  You ever get that feeling when you order and the server says, ""oh excellent choice"", that he's just BS'ing you?  And even if you decided on the liver and onions, he'd be all ""oh, that is quite the exquisite choice, sir"".  I feel bad, cuz he was a cool @ss kid, but whatever, whachu-on-do-eh?  Now take your skinny jean wearing @ss and get me some of that complimentary sourdough! Well, we ended up with stuff off their new smaller-cheaper-wannabe-tapas-section.  Their southern fried chicken sliders were what I needed in my life!  I thought Paula Dean had made them.  I tip my hat to you CCF.  Everything else was mediocre including the stuffed mushrooms that looked more like hardboiled egg yolks.  Also, I'm not a fan of FuFu drinks, but I must say, their Georgia Peach drink looks like a peach and is quite pleasing.  Still though, I stuck to my Sapporo beer and handed the GF her drink back.  Unwillingly, but I had to keep my manhood intact ;) I'm not a Cheesecakeologist, so I'm no expert on the subject on Cheescakeology.  I will say this though, their carrot cake cheesecake is pretty damn good.  No BS.  You know how I do, I come correct with the praise. What I am though, is a sneaker fanatic.  I can't help but stare at the dirty@ss sneakers that used to be white that they wear.  Look at them next time. They'll amaze you. But yeah yeah yeah, they're workin' so it's cool. Once you're done with your meal, there's really no where else to go besides Barnes and Noble to get your free read on.  Don't go towards the movie theatre unless you are a fan of lame@ss teenagers wearing skinny jeans that hang halfway down their @ss.   Straight up real talk.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=760

The wife ordered the corn fritters appetizer, but it was rather bland. We were hoping for something either sweet or savory, but it was neither. The dipping sauce had a little kick to it, but I don't do to well with sauces, so I only had a little. The Chicken Medallions my wife had were alright. She didn't really like the sauce the used and the rice was kind of dry. It was kind of like someone was going to stir-fry the ingredients, but then decided not to at the last moment. I had a Classic Burger which was quite good and tasty. It was so filling that I barely touched the fries, which were also good. The service was quite good though, especially for a busy Saturday.

The seats/tables  are pretty tight, when another table next to you is leaving they have no choice to bump yours in order to get out, noticed it on both ends & we are small so it wasn't because we needed additional room. Other than that it's a nice atmosphere, noisy which just means people are having a good time & talking, etc service was good, appetizer was good: the calamari was nice & crispy. My chopped salad was good, one of my faves. My friend laughed at her small sandwich & salad which was on the lite menu but we told her that's how they keep it light. We ordered a chocolate Sunday too share, they put lots of whip cream on it & some ice cream. We wanted cheesecake but we left the decision to our friend who had been craving a Sunday.

Cheesecake Factory doesn't do anything great, but they do things to satisfaction. Service: The service has always been good here. Most of the waiters are younger college age, they're attentive and work fast. Some waiters have been real helpful and made some good suggestions. Many of my experiences have been pleasant.   Food: Appitizers: The appitzers here are all average in taste. Nothing original but they have all the favorites like spinach/cheese dip, quesedilla, popcorn shrimp. Burgers:  Ive tried many burgers off the menu from the Classic to the Kobe beef. The burgers are just ok, I think the burgers at ""the Counter"" are cooked better. I don't think I'm gonna order anymore burgers here, Just too many better burgers in OC to be eating here.  Pasta: The pastas here are the items I generally enjoy the most. Anything with shrimp has been good. The portions on the pastas are always large, you can easily share between two.  Cheesecake: Sometimes I don't order anything except a slice of cheesecake. Their cheesecake isn't extraordinary but it hits that cheesecake spot pretty damn good. Every bite is like creamy soft calorie infused goodness. There's many different flavors and I'm unsure if I'll ever be able to try them all. If anything just get the cheesecake  When we can't decide on where to eat sometimes we'll end up at Cheesecake Factory. The prices are decent and you get good food.

As soon as I lifted it, the bottom bun just fell apart. My cousin ordered the Four Cheese Pasta and she enjoyed it, though. Our waitress was kind enough to bring us hot towels after our meal.    For dessert, we ordered a Chocolate Chip Cheesecake and it was delicious.

Bess B.,"Huntington Beach, United States",31,21,6,4.0,27/6/2011,"My husband and I enjoy Cheesecake Factory. They do a pretty good job at offering a consistent product so we always know what to expect.   We don't care for their cheesecake. Ya, I know that sounds odd, but it is so over the top sweet and rich. It's like eating butter, no thanks. What we love is  the fresh basket of warm sourdough and brown bread they place on the table. Delicious!!!!!  Now on to what we had there Saturday evening. I had one of my favorites, the Chinese Chicken Salad. It is a huge salad with lettuce, cabbage, slivered almonds, thinly sliced chicken, mandarin oranges, a delicious tangy dressing and a gigantic mound of crispy rice noodles on top. Since I am never able to finish this salad, I ask for the dressing on the side to preserve the crispness of the lettuce, so I can bring 1/2 home and have it the following day. While the salad was delicious as always, I have noticed that on the last few visits there is less and less chicken. My husband got the club sandwich which comes with french fries. This is a typical club with turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato.. All this goodness is placed between three pieces of sourdough bread. He loved it, and also took 1/2 home for the following day. The fries were amazing, I know 1st hand as I periodically helped myself throughout our meal.  The service was outstanding. We were greeted warmly when we sat at a high top in the bar. Our server was friendly and promptly took our drink order and returned with my chardonnay and my husband's cold beer. She was attentive during our meal, but did not make us feel rushed. Hint: This place is very busy, we always skip the wait to  dine in the dining room and head for the bar where we can help ourselves to a high top. We go just before regular lunch or dinner hours. Their happy hour is really great too. Summary: *Huge portions *Consistent product *Many high calorie/high fat items, be careful if you are trying to eat   healthy *Grab a high top in the bar rather than waiting in line for the dining room *Fairly consistent service",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=860

lisa n.,"Hacienda Heights, United States",121,55,97,3.0,12/2/2008,"so...what to say about the cheesecake factory here...lets start off with the good... the few times i've been here the service hasn't been too bad, though i try and avoid the main dinner times so that could be it. hehe. The servers have always been pleasant, and able to crack jokes back to me and my friends who have gone in.  Food is pretty good. I play it safe and get pasta most of the time, Evelyn's Favorite being my favorite as well. yummy spring-ish pasta =)  Pretty much you've gotta figure that it's your standard fare of pastas, pizzas burgers at prices a little bit more expensive than they are sometimes worth, but *shrug* what are you going to do.  If nothing else, stay for the main attraction, which since it's cheesecake factory, umm definately the cheesecake!!! yum!!!! faves have to be the key lime cheesecake, Dulce de leche, vanillla bean, and craig's crazy carrot. I'd love to reccomend some of the chocolate ones, however since i'm allergic...not so much =p But some of the ones that my friends like are the chocolate coconut and the godiva chocolate cheesecake. and now the not so good... since it's bella terra be prepared to possibly walk a decent distance to get wherever you're going Sometimes even the parking structure is packed.   Also, service can really be a hit or miss, especially when it starts to get busier and then your server tends to disappear.  okay. well go in and enjoy kiddies! =) hehehe",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=920
Michelle N.,"Irvine, United States",42,136,26,4.0,2/1/2008,"I am not a huge fan of American food (as you can see by my reviews), especially chains, but this one is okay in my book! I have eaten here a few times now and I have to say that the food and service have been excellent. The place is massive and the wait will be a bit long weekend evenings, but the place is huge so you move through pretty quickly. The decor is a bit odd...a mix of Egyptian and art nouveau, but it is fun and the massive booths are comfy. My servers have always been quick and super nice, which is good when I bring along the fam. I have to say that I was surprised at how good their corn cakes (appetizers) and pizza were.  But what really got me was how tasty their fish and chips were. Almost brought a tear to my eye as I doused it with more malt vinegar...the fish was juicy and flaky, and the coating wasn't geasy and even stayed slightly crispy under my 2 cups of required vinegar required to eat it (because everyone knows that vinegar cancels out all that cholesterol, right?). I would happily go back and order it again, esp since it is cheaper than O'Malleys if you make it for the lunch special and it is a more manageable size.  Another thing I always get when I go here is their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Dear God, it is super rich, but it is super fluffy, dark chocolatey and good. What is nice is that the slice is so massive that it takes about 5 days to finish off a slice, so you get your money's worth. Ah, and I noticed parking is a huge issue with most reviews, and I can see why. If you actually attempt to park around this restaurant, be prepared to drive agressively because it is absolutely nuts around there. If you are not doing valet, then park over by Staples because it is always quiet in that area and you will need the walk after you finish eating there. So, check this place out if you are in the area and get there by 5 so you can take advantage of their lunch specials.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=920

I ordered the shepherd's pie and coffee and my friend ordered a salad and tomato basil pasta with chicken. I have to say that I am a coffee snob to the highest degree and their coffee was really good for not being freshly ground and french pressed coffee. My friend's salad was big, very fresh ingredients and the vinagrette was good too. Then the main dishes arrived.  Holy crap they were huge!! Both entrees easily could be divided into 3 portions each and you would still be full. The shepherds pie was delicious. A hearty, winey, brown gravy with lots of mushrooms and the potato topping was awesome! The pasta was also really good-very flavorful and loved the feta cheese in it! Both of us took home a huge amount of food, enough for at least 2 more servings. We were too full for cheesecake, so maybe next time I will just order dessert! I am deducting 1 star for parking.

Mike F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, United States",0,6,,1.0,31/12/2012,"We visited this location last week.  It was our third or fourth visit and it is always the same.  Each time I think I'll give them one more shot at making it better, but it just doesn't happen.  In summary, the food is decent, but the service and the attitude of the employees (including the manager ""Joe"") seems to be, with rare exception, very poor. First let me say that we drive a long way to get there, as we come from Long Beach, and have our family with us making a party of five.  We HATE to wait, so we always try to make a reservation.  While they supposedly do make reservations, their reservation system, if you can call it that, is of absolutely no benefit to their patrons.  The reason is that they only appear to allow reservations when they do not expect to be busy and you would therefore not need a reservation anyway.  Examples?  We wanted a reservation for lunch on the afternoon of Christmas eve.  When I called, I was told that they were only allowing lunch reservations before 11:30 AM  or after 3:15 PM.  I specifically asked the hostess if she meant they were already full between those times or if they simply were not allowing reservations between those times.  She very clearly stated they were not allowing reservations then because they expected to be full with lunch walk-ins.  We made a reservation for five at 3:30 PM, and when we got there the place was no more than half full.  The same situation occurred when I called to try to make a 1:30 PM lunch reservation this morning (12/31).  I was told that they were only allowing reservations for 11:00 AM, which is the time they open.  Why would anyone need a reservation for the time they open... of course they would have tables open at that time. To be fair, I also spoke to the manager ""Joe"" about this issue.  I was told that they expected to be busy and didn't want to be holding tables for 5-10 minutes for the reservations of people who might be late.  I suggested that they simply not hold the table, but rather simply put late arrivals at the top of their waiting list when they did arrive.  He said that would be unfair to those people who had actually been waiting.  I asked if he could explain this, as I saw no logic to this view since if the reservation party had shown up on time the people waiting on the list would still be delayed by the same amount of time until a table opened up.  This seemed to stump him, as there was a long pause before he finally stated that this was simply their policy.  I then asked why they would not allow ""call ahead"" seating, as nearly every other major chain allows, where you could call ahead to be put on the same waiting list you would be on if you walked in and put your name on the list.  I explained that I felt that such a policy was far more respectful of their patrons' time, because a person could call ahead, get an estimate of how long the wait was at that time, get put on the list, and plan to be at the restaurant by the end of the expected wait time, thus eliminating most or all of their wait.  He said he felt this would also be unfair to the people who had walked in an put their name on the list.  When I asked how, he had no specific response.  I explained that many other restaurants, including Claim Jumper, Mimi's Cafe, Outback Steakhouse, Chili's, On The Border, and some Olive Gardens, to name just a few, allowed call ahead seating because they were respectful of their custoimers' time.  Of course, his position was completely unchanged. If not for the fact that my girlfriend likes this place, I would NEVER patronize any Cheesecake Factory (and try to avoid them, if at all possible) due to the generally poor service and their very poor customer service perspectives, despite a decent variety and decent quality of food.  I believe there is no logical explanation for their reservation policy (or the lack of an intelligent one) except that they (1) simply want people to wait in the bar and buy alcohol, thus contributing to upping their sales of alcohol, or (2) simply don't care about the value of time to their customers.  I specifically asked ""Joe"" for any other logical explanation and didn't get one.  As far as I'm concerned, I only want to give my money to retailers who value me, my guests, our time, and our business.  Cheesecake Factory is clearly NOT one of those retailers!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=900

The last time I ordered cheesecake factory for pick up. When I called to place my order I was placed on hold for literally 22 minutes. My call was never picked up so I hung up and called back. This time my order was taken right away. My food item in particular had some substitutions to it due to MAJOR allergies. When I go in to pick up the food, two out of the three items that were ordered were wrong. I kindly asked them to remake them. One was just completely wrong, and the other one (mine of course) had cheese on it which I am so allergic to. The people at the bakery were rude about remaking the orders even due to health reasons. Finally when I got the orders remade and returned to me I left. When I was home and eating my pasta, I found a chunk of beef in it (the pasta didn't even have beef in it to begin with) but once again I am allergic to it. I had to stop eating my entire pasta and throw it away. If I had not noticed the beef in my pasta and ate it I could have been hospitalized (yes that serious).

My friends just had to mention it was my birthday too, so 3 waiters came over and sang ""happy birthday"" to me in a very monotone ""I wish I wasnt here, this is embarrassing, I hate my life"" type of sound. Oh well, I really like The Cheesecake Factory, and obviously if you come to a place with a dessert title in their name, then you HAVE to try their desserts!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=900
fran d.,"Long Beach, United States",456,513,66,3.0,5/11/2008,"i love cheescake factory desserts but that's about as far as the love for cheesecake factory extends to. i have visited this place more times than i care to admit. all on account of the movie theater nearby of course and not my love for visiting this establishment. granted, the place looks sharp. there is an outside area with heater lamps and the seats inside are very plush and comfortable. however the wait times are horrific and you can't help but feel like hungry cattle waiting for your turn to feed and for what? sure the menu selection is quite ample and so is the drink menu, but the food is just marginal and unexceptional. the place is clean but the service? well, i will cut the staff some slack by saying that you can only do so well with so much people that come eat at this establishment. so there is that to consider in the rating. in conclusion, this place gets only three stars because cheesecake this good deserves at least that many.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=900
Edward L.,"Los Angeles, United States",450,67,1,4.0,2/8/2007,"I normally avoid this chain of establishments due to the torrid waiting times.  Went here for a lunch meeting and didn't have to wait at all. Lunch time is actually like a complete different animal without stressed out waiters, hostesses all burnt out like bad toast, and a did I forget to mention the long wait? Food is very decent - had a salad and the waitress followed my instructions completely with a smile. Go to this place for lunch - In someone's face after will you not feel like giving a smashing punch.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=900
Matin E.,"Huntington Beach, United States",6,18,3,1.0,13/11/2007,"Well well well....what can I say that hasn't yet been repeated? I came in with a group of 7 other friends on a Tuesday night, pleased to see that the restaurant was about half empty, and confident that we'd be seated rather quickly. Boy, was I wrong! If I were to summarize my experience in one word, that one word would be SLOW! After vowing to my friends that I would leave after the 25 minute wait mark, the time came and went so I headed towards the door, but not before explaining to the absent minded employee at the front desk that they should have told us it would take this long at the beginning of our wait. A few friends resisted my move, pointed to the empty tables and seated themselves, so I begrudgingly relented in consideration to the others that really wanted to stay.  The food itself wasn't anything to write home about. I ordered the fish & chips, which basically tasted like mushy cardboard heavily seasoned with salt. I went through about 4 mugs of water, and an additional 4 when I got home. At the end of the night, the meal left a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively. For a better experience, visit the Cheesecake in Fashion Island. The management at this location really needs to get its act together, I hope Cheesecake Corporate is listening.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=900
Calee A.,"Chatsworth, United States",321,155,36,4.0,17/10/2009,"I always love going to restaurants who serve bread. Especially when their bread is BOMB (their brown molasses bread, mmmm)! Their Chicken Madeira is my favorite dish here so far. They say it's their most popular chicken dish which consists of sauteed chicken breast with asparagus and cheese on top served with mashed potatoes and mushroom sauce. SO DELICIOUS. I've tried other things here like the orange chicken..I don't even know WHY I ordered orange chicken at an expensive restaurant like this (when I could've gone to Panda or something); I guess b/c my pregnancy cravings were kicking in & I wanted Chinese food so bad & I had no other choice because it was my best friend's birthday...it wasn't horrible. :) I also enjoy their parmesan crusted chicken. There are a few other dishes I'd love to try here, but it's pretty pricey. It's good to come here once in a while, for special occasions. The service at this location, during my experience, was really good. Our waitress was very sweet & on point. Is that red velvet cheesecake I see in those pictures? That's it, I'm going there tomorrow. *evil laugh*",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=900
Epi I.,"West Sacramento, United States",3,391,1,3.0,14/1/2010,"I've been to this CF at Bella Terra and while it's a very nicely decorated restaurant, the staff could be a bit friendlier.  I've been here several times and it's because this CF is not too far from where I live.  The waiters/waitresses could spend some time severing their customers.  This last time I visited CF w/a friend of mine and they seated me in this cramped 2-chair hardly-a-booth.  I asked to be moved to a regular booth.  Then my friend and I placed our order but before we asked if the salad we were ordering would be enough for 2 people given that some salads are way too much food for one person, let alone two people.  Well, the waitress said the salad I was asking about was ENOUGH for 2 people.  When we got the salad, it was hardly enough for one person.  So, there I felt the waitress didn't advice us right.  When I asked about this she sort-of argued with me.  Plus the annoying thing is that someone else other than the waitress brings your food.  So, basically when they bring you the food, that person doesn't know who ordered what.  I'm not sure why the waitress doesn't bring the food.  After all, she is the one who will be looking for a tip, right?  I ordered on the side red pepper flakes.  Well, I saw the waitress write it down but the pepper was never brought to me.  I had to flag the waitress down.  I gave this experience 3 stars but only because the cheesecake I ordered right after the dinner, was to die for GOOD!  It was the carrot-cake cheesecake.   I think this particular CF is popular because it's in the middle of HB and Westminster plus it's next to Barnes & Noble and near the 405/Beach Blvd. IF A MANGAGER WENT AROUND AND MADE SURE CUSTOMERS WERE SATISFIED WITH THEIR MEAL, I THINK THIS PLACE COULD BE THE BEST RESTAURANT IN HB.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=900
Under P.,"Borrego Springs, United States",7,48,1,2.0,19/1/2008,Way to crowded and service sucks.  Overhyped because of it's name at this location.   You are better off driving to Newport and getting better service with shorter wait times.   Food tastes the same like all other Cheesecake Factories.  One cool thing this place has over Newport is the Drive up service.  Call your order in and they bring it out to the car for you....,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=900

Danny N.,"Anaheim, United States",24,20,8,1.0,27/6/2009,"My fiance and I were hungry tonight and we have not been out to a restaurant in awhile and decided that a Hibachi Steak and Rib Eye would be delicious. We arrived and waited about 20 minutes for our table. This was around 6pm. We were seated and looked through our menu and decided to pick out an appetizer. We waited patiently for 10-15 minutes and did not see a waiter come to help us. The table next to us had a server and was getting salads and bread. I believe that I had arrived before our neighbors. We decided to give it another minute or two but to our dismay, no one came to take our orders. We decided to leave and eat at a nearby restaurant in place of this one. This has been a very unpleasant experience and I do not foresee Cheesecake Factory being a future dining experience in the near future.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-huntington-beach?start=900
