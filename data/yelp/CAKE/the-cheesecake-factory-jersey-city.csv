Christie T.,"Randall Manor, NY",6,18,12,3.0,1/1/2018,The wait was not terrible and the staff was extremely friendly. The food was pretty Good but not amazing and it's expected but we have always had a great meal the few times we have gone. The pink lemonade drink was not my style but sounded good so I ordered it And the waitress was kind enough to switch It out for a glass of wine it was just very sweet. The loaded potato ball things were so good as well as the flat bread pizza. Dinner my husband absolutely didn't enjoy his but they changed it out and he got a new dish (to go) by the time he got it. Mine and the kids were just fine. I got 2 cheesecakes to go and just had some today and a piece of paper or something was inside of it so I am not happy about that but not much I can do being it was to go and 2 days later. Overall place was good because of the staff and the food was as expected and somethings tasted great and some not so much.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city
Christa Y.,"New York, NY",109,103,10,2.0,1/8/2018,"Food: The mushroom croquettes and herb crusted salmon were average. The Jamaican shrimp and chicken was a disaster. For a $20 entree, there are 3 small pieces of shrimp. The dish is described as ""very spicy"" on the menu, but tastes almost sweet with no hint of spice. The chicken taquitos were cold and tasteless with no hint of chicken in them.  Drinks: Absolutely watered down. Service: The server (Dominique K) seemed disinterested, took a while to get the bread, forgot the straw and had to be asked 3 times to get us a box at the end. We saw staff at other tables being much more friendly and attentive to their patrons. Overall: Will never repeat. The Newport Mall has so many better options NOTE TO MANAGEMENT: It is misleading to calculate ""suggested gratuity"" on the after-tax receipt total. It is customary to calculate tips on the pre-tax number.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city
Voncia H.,"Union City, NJ",0,2,2,1.0,12/27/2017,"Called in ordered for pickup, Angel hair pasta with shrimp. This is what got for $19.50. It's so nasty and only four shrimp, disgusted.  FOUR shrimp really!! So disappointing never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city
Chao X.,"Manhattan, NY",67,135,630,4.0,12/12/2017,Occasion: Casual lunch It was one of the days I craved pasta for lunch! So a colleague and I went to Cheesecake Factory to fulfill our pasta starvation!  Overall: Maybe it's because I didn't expect much from Cheesecake Factory but to me the food was actually more than decent! We shared 1 Jambalaya Chicken linguini and 1 huge quac with chips. The portion was so huge that we were so full and couldn't finish all of them.  Highly recommend:  Jambalaya Chicken Linguini Two kinds of linguini - regular and green - were covered with delicious sauce! Chicken was cooked perfectly - charred outside but juicy and tender inside! Definitely get this when you get a chance! But only large portion is available for this dish so recommend sharing among at least 2 friends  Guacamole with chips Even though it's not anything special - the chips are freshly fried and guac was well flavored! The portion is more than enough to feed 3 people.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city
Nzingha Z.,"Jersey City, NJ",112,43,519,4.0,11/10/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a no brainer establishment...why? because you know exactly what you're going to get! Good food! Oddly enough whenever I've gone to the Cheesecake Factory I never order cheesecake as my dessert...I haven't figured out yet why that always happens. Well anyway I ordered simple food today...crab bites, bang bang shrimp, Chinese chicken salad and Passionfruit Mojito. Let me get right to the point and close this post. Crab Bites Salad and Mojito and even the table wheat bread...I LOVE !!!!....but, those Shrimp were tasteless bland...blah blah blah I sent em back and got another order of the Crab Bites instead...then I was happy.

Marissa Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",740,1111,1531,3.0,9/29/2017,"Omg  This place is the absolute worst Cheesecake Factory in the USA  Stephanie the server was very nice The problem was my aunts burger was illegally served rare, there was blood on the plate.  Unbelievable.  Even our server Ally was shocked Then Stephanie The manager came by and apologized  That we had to wait for another brother to come out while me and my mother went about our fish plates The server offered my aunts a glass of wine while she waited and said that it would be comped We finally get the bill and of course there's two glasses of wine on the bill Stephanie approached the table And me told her that there was two glasses of wine when we were already told that The one glass would become we thought it was a simple mistake but Stephanie told us that Ally should've known better that it's illegal to comp alcohol in the state of New Jersey Actually it's illegal to serve warm eat undercooked to a person to consume.  She said that she could not take the wine off of the bill nor is she able to take the burger off when my aunt finally got the broker my mother and I were already finished eating Absolutely terrible Stephanie's attitude was like ""oh well"" No she did not offer a complimentary slice of cake- no we didn't want cheesecake, only what was promised.  It took the general manager Gilbert hear about it from Ally and we explained and he took off the burger G was very nice, so was our server,  The Asst Manager Stephanie is rude, unprofessional as a manager.

Joy Y.,"New York, NY",215,734,1115,4.0,9/6/2017,"My friend recently moved to an apt building 5 minutes away from here and I will never miss out on an adventure to check out the Cheesecake Factory. We came here for lunch, and when dinner time came, despite not being hungry, we scrolled through Seamless for half an hour until we decided to order from the CF twice in one day. The food from this chain is alway decent but never exceeds expectations other than with its sheer portion size. The inaptly named Skinnylicious menu should just be the regular menu. Even the Superfoods section consists of dishes well over 1k calories. Flavorwise, both the vegan cobb and the salmon salad are tasty, and so is the free bread. My bf's buffalo cauliflower also smelled amazing. Service is generally slow for both dine-in and take-out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city

Stephanie S.,"Jersey City, NJ",280,101,71,4.0,12/30/2017,I come here very frequent and when I do I always always always get the chipotle chicken pasta. Its my ultimate favorite plate on the menu in their massive options. I also occasionally order their calamari which is also great. There seems to always be a HUGE crowd at this establishment which is good. Luckily I was able to find a place in the Bar to sit and not wait on that long wait list to get a table. I never had any issues with the place. Only issue is that they messed up on my orders a couple of times but they always rectify it by either giving it to me for free or offering me something else which is always a plus.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city

Tony J.,"Jersey City, NJ",119,382,43,3.0,8/27/2017,"Shared some appetizers - avocado egg rolls, fried shrimp, and chicken samosas. Generally speaking they were pretty good. For entrees the portion size is ridiculous - if you had appetizers and want to save room for dessert, there's no way to finish a pasta dish without having some left over. I had the Louisiana chicken pasta, which was very tasty but a little bit on the oily side. For dessert we shared a selection of cheesecakes.

Sandra M.,"Jersey City, NJ",49,461,329,5.0,12/1/2017,"I'm not one to usually give five stars to a chain... But so far I really like the food here. The Cheesecake Factory and general was where I first discovered a love for sliders. I love the table bread here and recently tried the Truffle bacon grilled cheese appetizer. It was sinfully good. My girlfriend and I shared a filet mignon medium and they let us substitute the mashed potatoes and beans for asparagus and grilled broccoli. The asparagus came at a small of charge though, but that was okay. We actually then order dessert and got Godiva brownie sundae- it was really good. I typically order from the skinnylicious menu, but was craving a protein other than chicken. The Fiji Waters were a bit expensive at about $ 4 a bottle. Also, we were sitting at the bar area with the stroller and the management was nice enough to lower the music a bit as it got very loud early on into our lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city

I like to visit restaurants a few times before reviewing (depending on experience). First off, I never have any issues with the staff, they are all friendly and attentive.  The food has been pretty good so far with my personal favorite being the southern chicken sliders. They offer a few lemonade mixes but all seem to be a little to sweet.  Most recent visit, they have added a few more items to their menu and the kids menu has plenty of different options. My son ordered salmon, broccoli, and French fries which looked and tasted awesome.

Chang W.,"Manhattan, NY",19,8,50,1.0,12/26/2016,"Honestly, it is a decent American restaurant in the neighborhood. We go there almost every week. It is not the first time we experienced the extremely long waiting for the food. But this time is the most disappointed experience. The waiter placed the wrong order for us. Before they brought the wrong food, we already have waited for 40min. When he kept telling us, it was just 5min away. Then what happened after 5min was just another 5min. He kept saying that it was someone else ordered the wrong food and overrided his order. But he couldn't explain what happened. So don't go there if you don't have enough time to wait.  P.S.

Fried avocado/mushroom/zucchini appetizer came 20 minutes after my pasta...odd. I would've canceled it had Antonella not been so nice about it.

Hostess acted as we weren't standing there and I had to ask if we could get a table.....no such luck as we were forced to sit at high table in the bar area. I asked if it was okay that I had a minor in my party and I was surprised when they said yes it was fine....Our server acted as if we were bothering her by being there! She hardly checked on us and by the time it was time to pay we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for her to come and process the check!

It has been over 32 min for a simple to go order.  It is on Tuesday night at 9:38pm when I came in and it was slow for them. This is a bit ridiculous!

Jaritza M.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,14,7,4.0,10/29/2017,"Let's start off with the waiter . Antonella S, how can I put this nicely ? She was a horrible waiter. She seemed very nice, smiled and Took our order. Then I barely saw her. I was with two kids and my boyfriend. After the kids food came she got lost. She never brought me the water I asked for, for the whole table. She never came to bring us bread. She didn't bring me the drink I ordered which was a smoothie. She comes back in what seemed like forever to me and I then had to ask her for bread because she didn't seem like she was ever going to bring it and I felt like I was starving to death. Still didn't bring me my water or my drink. Didn't come back to check if the kids food was okay or if they needed anything. The kids are almost done with their food and she STILL didn't come back with my water or bread or anything. By this point I was BEYOND frustrated and starving half to death. Another waiter by the name Yoval not sure his position but must of noticed the frustration in my face because he randomly came up to us and asked if we would want some bread. He was awesome compared to my waiter who lacked bunch of waiter skills. Then she came with my drink after she saw him helping us. Not sure if she had too many tables or if she just kept forgetting about us because she didn't even apologize the times she did happen to come back. He also came around to see if we needed refills on our drinks. She came and gave us the dessert menu and then never came back. The same gentleman kept looking at us and eventually came to see what we wanted to order. Im not going to let one sour apple ruin the tree so my waiter may have been horrible at customer service but the food was BEYONDDDDDDDD GOOD. I had the hibachi steak with mashx2 And some fried shrimp on top and it was to die for. I don't think I even stoped to breath lol my boyfriend had the chicken with steak combo with mash and Mac and cheese on the side . Which was also very good . Ultimately this place has GREAT food they probably should just coach that specific waiter on paying attention to her tables.

The food is never consistent with the way they serve it when you dine in. DO NOT order take out from this location. They overcook and burn everything.

In terms of portion and quality although service was good. Me and my husband ordered one appetizer of Avocado Toast and an entree of Tuscan Chicken. We split the entree to two.  Avocado Toast- 1/5         It is one of my favorite dish and here at cheesecake it is the worst thing I ever had. The bread was too rough even the avocado spread on it could not make it soggy. Tuscan Chicken - 3/5          It has very small pieces of chicken breast and the plate was covered in oil and lemon juice. Not at all tasty.

May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",433,575,457,4.0,12/31/2016,"Came here for dinner one night with the boyfriend and we had a great time. The set up in JC is pretty big and the ""outdoor"" space is really nice. I say outdoor with quotes because you're still sitting inside of the mall, just outside of the restaurant. It was nice and relaxing how they have it set up. Food here is always about quantity, but that's kinda why I like cheesecake factory. They give me a lot, though let me tell you, my stomach regrets it the next day. My go to here is the chicken bellagio, but their chicken sandwich and eggplant parm are my faves too. I usually get cheesecake too (tiramisu is my favorite), but this time, I opted for the apple strudel. It was pretty darn good! I wish they put more ice cream on it though to balance out the warm caramelized apples.

Michelle O.,"Jersey City, NJ",9,119,426,3.0,12/3/2016,"This place is always packed! 30 minutes wait for a table for 2 on Saturday at 7:30pm. They hand out buzzers so you can shop around while waiting for the table. Free bread: nice and warm! Whole wheat and white. Chicken Madeira: chicken, melted cheese, asparagus and mushrooms in a wine sauce. Comes with mashed potatoes. It's pretty good, although I felt the wine sauce was a little too sweet. Louisiana style chicken and pasta: Parmesan crusted chicken over bow tie pasta. The chicken was super crispy and great, but the pasta was bland. This dish showed up as the #1 dish to order in Cheesecake Factory in my research. I was surprised when it didn't turn out as good.  Tiramisu cheesecake: when tiramisu and cheesecake married and had a child, this is it. Coffee-soaked lady finger bottoms, mascarpone-cheesecake filling and topped with a layer of chocolate powdered mascarpone cream. My only small complaint is the chocolate cream swirl is too sweet (you can remove it if u want - it's not mixed into the cake). Our 2 entrees could probably feed 3. We brought home leftovers. Our bill was $46. They are running a promo now where if you purchase a $25 gift card, you get a free slice of cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=20
Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,116,18,3.0,10/21/2017,"This review is for both dine in and takeout.  My first experience here was dine in, my date and I were seated promptly, waitress was very helpful and well mannered. As an appetizer, we chose the Tex Mex egg rolls. I ordered the farfalle with pancetta, mushrooms, and chicken (minus the peas and carmelized onions that usually come with it). I also opted for spaghettini instead of farfalle and my waiter graciously accepted my alterations. My date went for the chicken alfredo. Both dishes came to us piping hot, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. The Cheesecake Factory goodness that I fondly remember from years ago. Unfortunately my delivery experience was far from as pleasant as the dine in. Last night, via DoorDash, my date and I went for TCF again. He went for the turkey burger with cheese and french fries on the side. I went for the same pasta, instead I got shrimp instead of chicken in it. The food came fairly cold, there were still onions in mine, the shrimp was tough and cold, and they didn't put any pancetta in even though I didn't ask for that to be removed. There was also no sauce in it. It seemed like they made the dish in a pan, drained the remaining sauce and let it sit and dry out for 30 minutes. My date's burger was a little cold but seemingly good, although the fries were no dice; soggy and cold. I know that I had a few alterations but I really can't see myself sending out a such a crappy dish like this, being in their place. Can't see myself ordering delivery from ever again. Not exactly fun spending almost $20 a mediocre, hardly edible dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=20
Amy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,159,204,4.0,7/16/2017,"Surprised to see a 3/5 for this joint...but it was also my first time here. My friends and I came from NYC just to eat here. I was blown away; never have I given chain restaurants any credit, in fact, it has always been one disappointment after another. But the incredibly high number of calories of each drink, entree, and dessert on this menu only made me want more. I don't really remember the names of the plates we got, but I was surprised to see them range from pasta to Thai to good ol' American. I loved my shrimp pasta and got a good kick out of my friend's spicy Thai chicken (actually don't even know if it's called that). So the lesson is: don't be alarmed that you'll go over your calorie intake in less than 45 minutes and don't let the 1000 items on the menu dissuade you from ordering too much :) Better advice: don't wear skinny jeans to this meal.

The order took 35 minutes for two dishes !!! How much time does it take to make Spicy Chicken over rice fellas ?????  They say the dish took longer than usual to make. After 35 min, all We got was cold food. They have no explanation to that. It only means that the food was ready sometime back and they didn't get it to the table. The food was taken back to kitchen and when the re-served one dish had too much salt in it. By then our appetite was over and we got food packed cuz we couldn't eat. They sent their manager to talk to us who turned out to be another waiter.  Bunch of a**holes and liars work here. The whole management & staff needs to be 'fired'. Even after all this, I had to PAY for the late food !!  We are never coming back. And neither We will recommend this place to anyone. There is a reason why this place got 2.5 star as compared to other cheesecake factories. Re-Edit after reading other reviews-- Cheesecake Factory Guest Services ! Plz don't bother apologizing for poor service or thanking for honest feedback.

The ambiance is like its other locations, very cozy and intimate.  It does get crowded and you might be waiting some time for a table during peek dining hours.   The food is flavorful a little on the pricey side but it's a better option then most chain restaurants if u don't feel like cooking.  Don't forget to grab yourself a slice of cheesecake heaven.  I don't even like cheesecake or sweets like that but I tried a slice of the salted caramel cheesecake.  WOW!!!!

Agreed this is in a mall and does get crowded most of the time over the weekends but when it's not- I don't understand what the strategy is in putting your customers on a waitlist despite having plenty of empty tables. The portions are big enough just like at any other Cheesecake Factory. Thrice I have been here and all the three times they got us the molasses(brown) bread late with the meal.

Whenever I go, I always order the fried cheese, avocado toast, and their chipotle pasta! I would rate them 5/5! However, the last time we went, not only did our waiter forget about our order for a half hour, we ordered their new dish called ""Korean style cauliflower"" and it came really cold and soggy.

They hostess was unapologetic and made us walk all the way back to the hostess station (past plenty of open/clean tables). When they finally sat us the floor was filthy and table was sticky. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 130 and the place was not exceptionally crowded at all. The family who eventually was seated next to us had a baby and requested a booth which they did not give them. The mom was requesting a booth and the hostess told them they would have to go back and wait again even though the booth across from us was open. Then proceeded to take 15 min to bring them a height chair. The only reason this location didn't get one star was because we had James m. as our server and he made up for the lack of customer service the rest of the team presented with.

The wait for two people wasn't bad about 20 minutes. The mall had seats outside the restaurant playing Christmas movies on the tv. I personally don't like how close the tables are together preferred a little more privacy. I wasn't to crazy about what I ordered the black beans had no flavor what's so ever and the ""Jamaican"" Chicken was nasty. If it's going to be Jamaican it should have a little spice in it. He ordered pasta that he really like. The red velvet cheesecake was amazing as it should be since it's there specialty. Waiter should listen more when taking an order as well as repeat it back to make sure it's what you ordered. I'm willing to give this place one more try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=60

We were worried we wouldn't be able to fit it in, but were pleasantly surprised at the wait time, especially compared to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants that we have been to. We grabbed our drinks at the bar and soon after we were seated.  My husband had the grilled chicken tostada salad and I had the Kobe burger. The portions were huge, so we didn't make it to the cheesecake, but we really enjoyed our meals. My burger had great flavor and was really juicy and I loved the fries!! They were so good.

Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,940,15318,5.0,7/31/2016,"Today, National Cheesecake Day July 30, 2016 was a four star experience. From the time we entered the restaurant we were smiled at and greeted by friendly employees. My daughter asked for a booth for two. We were seated promptly near the kitchen area. Better to be closer to the food!! We looked over the menu and made our decision. We were told out server would be with us soon. I assumed he was the server assisting a huge party of about twelve. Sure enough he came over introduced himself as Ty. So nice and knowledgeable about everything Cheesecake Factory. We were hungry and ready to order. He took our order making special note of my allergy to tomato.  In no time our food arrived looking absolutely delicious. We were chewing down and Ty gave us a check to see if we were fine. He was great with his timing and not a pest. He still kept up with that huge group that looked like they were having a ball! Our dishes were removed when we were done and Ty promptly took our desert request. Again it was no time before I had my Vanilla Bean Cheesecake that I inhaled with no problem. My daughter took her Nutella Cheesecake to go.  Only two small problems. I won't take away stars because overall it was the best experience I've had at this location.  First, my daughter didn't want whipped cream to go. She got it anyway. I couldn't get a decent photo. Her slice was a mess in the container before we left. It shouldn't change the taste. I'll get a report when she eats it.  Second, every time we've been to eat at this location we have had something flying around our food. Once it was a fly. Today it was a little bug of some kind. I really wish they would fix that problem. I don't like to share my food!! Maybe N.J. doesn't have the strict rules we have in NYC. Didn't have this issue in Wayne or Hackensack though at their Cheesecake Factory.  Still Ty especially made this a great experience. Half price Cheesecake didn't hurt either.

No wonder there was a half hour wait the day after snowpocalypse.... there weren't that many people, ya'll just weren't doing your job right. Again, the wait is EXCESSIVE.  I understand this is a fairly new establishment, but it seems like the manager has to step up his/her game. Stop making people wait longer than necessary. It's in everyone's best interest, right? I've never been to this mall before, and was appalled to find that CF was, really, the only place to go for a drink and some apps to finish off our shopping. Wait, what shopping? Most stores were closed and the stores that the Newport Centre had sucked anyway. The nachos with chicken? NAILED IT. BEST I've ever had - so I'll give ya'll a 3. Our drinks (mmmm mai tai) were delicious. I've been to the Hackensack CF the most, and that place is noticeably more organized than this place.

Then our waitress disappeared for over 10 minutes and we wanted to place our dinner orders. I had to flag another waitress to find her.  We were done with the appetizers and drinks and no one came back to the table to see if we wanted refills or more appetizers. Fast forward 45 minutes later...finally our dinner plates started showing up at the table 2 at a time. 1 person had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the Chicken & biscuits meal. At this point everyone was clearly aggravated. The manager came to our table once just to hand us our drinks from the bar..When we requested him to come to the table again he sent someone else. Long story short. 3 people had to send their dinner plates back, we barely saw our waitress  and the manager cowardly hid from us.

We ordered the smokehouse burger with sweet potato fries and I had the bow tie chicken pasta with a garlic sauce (I forgot what it's called). My bf said his burger was pretty good but wished he got more fries since all you get is about a cup full. My pasta was pretty good. It had really good flavors and  I really liked the tomatoes in it. My only thing is it had kind of a burnt aftertaste. Not sure if it was supposed to taste like that or it was the pancetta. Regardless I ate it and it was still good. Probably won't order that again though. James was great with keeping our cups full and answering any questions we had. CHEESECAKE TIME!  We ordered two kinds, the red velvet cake and the white chocolate macadamia caramel cheesecake. My boyfriend liked them both.

The service was so slow and inattentive it was a bit annoying, and I'm generally a fairly patient person.  The restaurant was pretty crowded, but they seemed to have enough staff to handle the tables, and then some, as there seemed to be servers and runners milling about all over the place.  It took about 15 minutes before our server came to take our drink order, and then another 15 before he brought the drinks and took our food order.  He forgot one of our appetizers.  Also, the food came out at different times, which should never happen at a restaurant.  When we did need something, our server often came to take orders from neighboring tables without ever looking our way.  I have worked as a server and bartender, so I know, you never come onto the floor without giving a quick glance to all of your tables to see if someone is trying to flag you down.  It is really frustrating when you are waving your arms and the server never even looks your way.  Why do I have to yell across the restaurant?  Clearly they were not that interested in seating the growing crowd of people in their lobby, because I even had to get up and go hand him my credit card personally, because I wasn't sure if he was ever going to come pick it up.

We had to ask for bread 3 times from three different servers and finally the bread arrived. Now it was time for dinner and 3 out of the 4 dinners ordered arrived so we all waited to eat and about 20 minutes later we had to ask the server where the dinner was, she went back to check and came back later on and bought the much awaited dinner which by this time all the rest of our food was cold.

After about a half hour, we go the drinks, but not the appetizer.  30 MORE minutes pass, and we are wondering where our appetizer (nachos and guac) is. The server (who was very nice), said they accidentally gave it to another table. We then had to wait another 10 minutes to get the appetizer. By the time we got it, our entrees had come out. We didn't even finish the appetizer.  I ordered tasteless, greasy, Chicken Piccata, which looked like something you'd get at an army base. The portions were really small (it was like chicken tenders drenched in greasy butter sauce), and the noodles were overcooked. My friend ordered enchiladas and told me the ones I made at home were better than CCFs. We decided to ask for water, and it took the server 10 more minutes to bring the water!  By this time we were annoyed and just wanted to go. We didn't even order the cheesecake because we wanted to get the hell out of there! We got the check, and they didn't even offer to comp the nachos appetizer. We paid for the meal, and decided that this would be our last time at CCF in Newport Mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=100
Zyeshia J.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,2,,4.0,12/18/2016,"This is my first time coming to this Cheesecake Factory. I was not greeted at the door but I'm guessing that's due to the fact that it is in a mall. The hostess who placed me on the wait list never looked up at me, she simple asked named and party size ( that could've been better). That aside , my wait time was not bad , the staff was very friendly . My waitress Mellissa was AMAZING. She was attentive , friendly , efficient and warm.  I  ordered the crab bItes and parmesan crusted chicken . Both were tasty and hot when they arrived at the table . I would definitely come back.

Earle H.,"Atlanta, GA",204,168,77,4.0,7/25/2016,"Well, it has probably been about 8 years since I've dined at the Cheesecake Factory.  I generally stay away from chain restaurants but this was the most convenient food nearby and you can't really go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.  The flavor is consistent and the menu is quite extensive to satisfy your taste for just about whatever you may want on a given day. I had the Cobb Salad.  It was pretty good and for those who don't know, The Cheesecake Factory salads can normally feed 2 people easily.  A few other items were being passed around on the table like fried calamari and crab bites, both pretty good appetizers.  And who can forget about their warm bread, especially that pumpernickel loaf. Yum! The tropical-flavored house iced tea is always a welcomed refreshing treat to wash it all down.  I didn't taste the other items that my family order but all I heard was ""nom, nom, nom..."" as we all stuffed our hungry faces so that's always a good sign.  For dessert, we shared the banana cheesecake and the turtle cheesecake.  If you have ever had Cheesecake Factory cheesecake, you know that they don't play when it comes to the cheesecake in terms of the size of their menu and the flavor.   I spent many an evening at The Cheesecake Factory when they first opened and began expanding beyond Atlanta all the way to the San Francisco Bay Area.  All in all, even though I don't visit often nowadays, the Cheesecake Factory still holds a special place in my heart for nostalgia's sake if nothing else and I was happy to find that the food was still what I expected and the martini menu is still on point!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=100

I have always enjoyed eating at Cheesecake Factory, so when one opened up a few miles from my house I was super excited. I have been to this location several times and mostly I solo dine at the bar. This review can be credited to Ally who is bartending this Monday afternoon. She is super friendly and efficient. I was never offered bread at the bar prior to today's experience. I usually order 1 or 2 small plates for myself. She always made sure my glass of water was full! I am super critical of dining out because I work in the restaurant industry.

We had high expectations for the desserts but did not know what to expect with the rest of the food. It turned out that both entrees that we had, the Chicken Bellagio and the Miso Salmon, we're excellent. Ironically it was the cheesecakes (Salted Caramel and Chocolate Tuxedo Cream) that didn't overwhelm us - they were okay.

Serena N.,"Jersey City, NJ",115,528,7142,2.0,8/20/2016,"We just visited this location and I have to say it was the most disappointing experience at Cheesecake Factory I have ever had. The air is very stale in this restaurant and whomever designed the HVAC did a poor job.  The restaurant also has a mildew like smell. To start, there were a lot of empty tables but the wait was still 15 minutes. We were seated and given menu's. We ordered a passion fruit margarita (served in a martini glass) which was extremely too sweet, again it taste like chemicals and not freshly made. Our server brought us water but for some reason put no ice in it so it was luke warm.  We didn't get any bread, and like the table next to us we had to ask our server for it. For the appetizer we got the zucchini, mushroom and avocado batter dipped ($6.95). There were 2 pieces of avocado and the rest was all soggy mushroom and zucchini pieces. Not good at all. They also threw Parmesan on top of it which made the sogginess worse. For the entree I ordered the Luau Salad which did not taste fresh at all. The salad was wilted and soggy. They also put way too much dressing in the salad. The crisp part was drowning in dressing, which had a chemical taste. Nothing tastes fresh. We decided to try the strawberry cheesecake (since it my husband's first time to Cheesecake Factory) and the strawberries ARE NOT fresh (like the menu states) but drowning in a strawberry concentrate and is extremely sugary and taste like corn syrup. Very disappointing experience. The food sucks as well as the ambiance. Complete waste of $70 (we also were not given an itemized receipt when we asked for the check, and were unable to locate our server to get one).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=100
Howard P.,"New York, NY",108,44,833,4.0,1/25/2016,"So I'm going to give this place a 4-star mostly because the nachos were awesome (perhaps somewhat surprisingly to me... Could've been low expectations sure. But they were tasty!).  After being trapped inside due to snowmageddon, my lady and I came to the mall to relieve some cabin fever. Mostly an empty mall. But Cheesecake Factory was open and we got thirsty. The bar is first come first serve and no seats. Despite seeing many a table open the hostess advised is was a 30 minute wait. We decided to put our name in and grab a drink. Luckily we were able to sit and just order from the bar so we never had to wait.  Drinks (margarita and some Mai tai's) were pretty good. As I said the nachos were delicious.  Service was slow. But could be because they were not expecting much with the storm? I don't know....  They had a tv to see the game if you wanted.  I guess it's a Cheesecake Factory and when you are at the mall it suffices. But get the nachos. And another tip: out your name Down and go shopping.

Lissa P.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,6,,2.0,2/26/2017,"We were told we would have a 20 minute wait, which was fine since one usually expects a wait on a weekend afternoon. Once we were seated, the people in the booth behind us were in an argument with their server, who was yelling back at them - so the server was replaced with another who now seemed to have to cover a bigger area. There were 5 of us...we put in our drink order - sodas and lemonades and while the sodas arrived quickly, we waited another 5 minutes for the lemonades. The food seemed to be slow coming out, the appetizers about 30 minutes after we ordered, one which was the wrong item and corrected quickly and the entrees, another 30 minutes later, with 2 of the 5 delayed another few minutes. All in all, we spent over 2 hours when it should have only been 1. While the server was pleasant, I feel that the pace needs to be picked up a bit.

I had such high expectations for this place but sadly I was very disappointed.  Service: The wait time was an hour but since the restaurant was new it was understandable. But the wait time also made me expect more...and honestly it was not worth the wait. The waiter was nice and friendly but when I asked her if she could recommend something she said everything was good and they had lots of specialties....umm wrong answer ...sigh. The menu was so long I really wanted a recommendation.  Food: The Fried Macaroni appetizer was incredible. For my entree I ordered the chicken Marsala. When it arrived I noticed my pasta was extremely over cooked. I tried to eat it anyway but I just couldn't it tasted horrible so the waitress took it back and nicely removed it from the bill.

The place is beautiful but they need better seating arrangements for customers who are waiting for over an hour just to be seated. We waited outside because there was just too many people waiting to be seated. As we waited out side the restaurant too many teenagers where walking past I was wondering if I was going to have front row tickets to see a fight break out. Honestly I felt unsafe for the little girl I had with me and for my boyfriends safety because security wasn't doing there job! So after a hour and a half the buzzer finally rings we had sometime to look at the menu on our phone and knew what we wanted. I ordered  pasta Da Vinci it was awesome. My boyfriend ordered the bacon bacon burger he loved it. And the little lady had the cheese pizza for kids and that was a thumbs up in her book!!  The wait staff needs better training. We had to keep reminding the waitress to bring out our drinks more then three times and when she finally did of course we finished our sodas not a minute after we got them.

At this point I felt discrimination against us for having a baby with us. We still waited about 2 more minutes and then the girl said :Ok , come with me there is a booth available ,as long the stroller is out of the way is fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=160

Vartika S.,"Manhattan, NY",37,36,13,1.0,10/3/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory but this location is the most disappointing one ever. It's close to my Apt so I've been here more than 5-6 times and each time the service has been bad. I didn't get their usual bread first two times so I started asking for it and to my disbelief I didn't get it on any of my visits !! Once I even asked my server where was my bread and he kept saying it's coming ! The servers are very inattentive, they'll takes ages to get to you after they've taken your order. No water refills, we had to chase our server for the check ! Seriously disappointed! I hope the management fixes the situation at this location !

I had to add lots of salt to make it somewhat more flavorful. The noodles were not garlicky at all! The Chicken and Biscuits came out okay but the biscuits were dry and hard. Very disappointed about the quality of food. Even though service was decent, but I would not come back.

We ordered cheesecake to go and as we were leaving, saw her seat another group of three at a booth. But no one else there really had great customer service except the employee at the to-go dessert bar.

Alicja A.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,6,4,1.0,1/2/2017,"Unfortunately, the standard at this restaurant was very poor. Where do I start? Having entered the restaurant, we had to wait for 25 minutes to be greeted and seated, finally the buzzer vibrated and the waitress took us to our table, which had crumbs all over the table and benches, not only that when we sat down our feet were sticking to the floor underneath the table that's how dirty it was, therefore my silverware was very disgusting and had food on it ( When I asked our waiter to bring me some clean silverware he apologized about it being dirty and said he would bring me some but...... I had to ask him twice because he kept on forgetting).....We ordered our drinks, and soon enough we ordered our appetizer which was the Thai Lettuce Wraps, they were delicious! We ordered our mains and they were very good as well. I strongly suggest for this Cheese Cake Factory to be cleaned more and more organized. I will never go there again !!! It was terrible !!!Don't be fooled, this place is very dirty, and the service was very poor. The upstairs food court would of been a way better choice!  P.S.

Victoria C.,"New York, NY",330,90,173,4.0,3/30/2016,"Food: B The food here was awesome mostly. We started with the Fried Calamari, and it came with both a garlic aioli and cocktail sauce - super tasty - and I noticed that the squid was very tender. Every time I order fried calamari, it's usually quite tough - it was ~delish~ here. The aioli, I think, consisted mainly of mayo - not complaining about, since it was SO good - but I wish it had been lighter so I didn't immediately feel my arteries clog up after taking one bite. Would have loved to eat more of it. The cocktail sauce was a more refreshing alternative. I actually really enjoy fried calamari with marinara sauce, though, so I wish that they had provided that as well. For our entrees we got the Chicken Bellagio and the Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo. The chicken dish was a breaded chicken breast over angel hair pasta (with a light pesto?) topped with prosciutto and arugula. My boyfriend loved it, and it came in a large portion. He has a good appetite and didn't finish it. Can't say the same about my combo dish, which also came with (a small amount of) mashed potatoes. It wasn't a huge problem for me since I still barely finished it - I was so full from the bread, appetizer and also barely touched the side of fries that I ordered (so unlike me). The presentation of this dish wasn't impressive, since the portions were small and it was spaced out over such a large dish. But the shrimp scampi was cooked very well - the sauce was absolutely delicious. Gotta warn you though, if garlic isn't your thing, I wouldn't get the shrimp scampi. Luckily, I LOVE garlic. As for the salmon, meh - overcooked IMO. I like my salmon with the center still a bit tender/soft, but it was tough/crumbly. The ""herb crusted"" part apparently just meant that some herbs were thrown on top of it. It just didn't look (or taste) that appetizing. A bit disappointing. After dinner, we ordered a slice of the chocolate mousse cheesecake to share, which we've had before, and it was super rich and chocolatey. It was very heavy, so I would recommend ordering a tall glass of milk or something on the side. I could barely eat any since I was so full already, but I really wish I could have eaten more of it. Service: A The service here was great - our waitress was very friendly but not intrusive. She was patient when we needed some time to look at the menu, and she was also good with timing - how much time we needed to look at the menu, when to space out our bread, appetizer, and entrees, etc. Our wine was taking a bit due to a backup at the bar, so she was kind enough to give us a heads up so we weren't left wondering if it was forgotten. She checked up on us to see how our food was after giving us enough time to actually eat a bit (some waiters ask only a moment after setting the food down, and I'm like...I've barely touched my food yet...) Timing is a huge thing when it comes to waiting tables. Good timing makes the patrons feel comfortable, relaxed and able to enjoy their meal; poor timing gives customers an experience where they feel rushed, impatient, and/or uncomfortable or even frustrated. I distinctly noticed that she was very good at her job. Ambiance: B This Cheesecake Factory is a part of the Newport Mall. We were seated in the ""patio"" area, outside the restaurant but inside the halls of the mall. They made sure to ask to make sure it was okay to be seated here. Seems weird since people shopping at the mall walk past you, but it wasn't that bad. I actually thought that we had a bit more privacy here than we would have inside, where it was super busy. I was a little concerned that because we were kind of separate from the rest of the tables, we would be forgotten (it happens) and the waitress would busy herself with the customers in the main area, but it was totally fine - our waitress was very attentive :) *thumbs up* A heads up, the patio area has patio furniture (wrought iron tables and all weather wicker sofas to sit on which was comfortable). Not everyone's cup of tea - some people might like the ""fancier"" vibe inside, but this was totally fine for us, even better since it was quieter and we could have a conversation. Other (Sanitation): C When we were seated, we saw that the table had not been cleaned properly - grease marks all over. After I asked our waitress about it, she sent someone over to wipe it, and the guy apologized. Understandable since the metal that the table was made of made it hard to see whether it was a grease mark or drying water. But what was annoying after that, though, was that they later gave us spoons for our cheesecake (dessert after our meal) that were also not very clean. Both my boyfriend and I took a look at our respective spoons and dipped them into a water glass and wiped them down before we felt comfortable enough to use them... Not ideal, especially after already giving us a table that hadn't been cleaned properly *thumbs down* Overall, I had a great time here and would come back! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=140

Ben B.,"New York, NY",0,14,,2.0,10/28/2016,"I live in the neighborhood and was looking forward to coming here. There is definitely some issues with management:  - Too many staff members not really serving anyone. There were 4 people behind the host stand, chatting and laughing with eachother... never looking me in the eye. I felt ignored.  - The waitress was nice, but seemed overworked. She was hard to find throughout the meal - One of our appetizers never came out..... by the time the entrees came we didn't want it anymore  - I ordered a burger and the bottom of the bun was soggy wet. I couldn't find the waitress and had to flag down another staff member (also asking for ketchup). I got a new bun, but the meal wasn't very good due to this. The ketchup eventually came - 10 minutes later.  - Waitstaff always seemed rushed, and asking for things like refills on drinks was hard to do because I felt I always had to chase down someone.  - I felt that becuase an appetizer never came out and the burger bun was so soggy, there would have been some sort of apology (a free apetizer, soda, dessert... something) Nothing was ever offered and because of this, I probably won't be back for sometime to come.  Overall, I give this place a subpar review (especially relative to other locations throughout the US). There were a few things that were on-par but there is a lot of work that needs to be done.

G E.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,5,,1.0,4/10/2017,"The service and management at this Cheesecake Factory located in Newport Mall, Jersey City has gone from poor to terrible. The first time I ever made an attempt to visit was shortly after they opened 2 years ago. I loved the establishment in other locations, and was always pleased with the Miso Salmon dish for nearly 16 years without a problem. I tried to pick up an order at the Newport Mall location shortly after they opened and they kept me on hold for 15-20 minutes or more (sounds unbelievable right...yeah I know, I couldn't believe it either). After all that hold time they still never took my order. I hung up the phone and opted for another restaurant   The last time I visited was last year. I ordered salmon that tasted somewhat like old fish, it was so bad I actually couldn't eat it and had to send it back (something I really hate to do). I then asked for chicken and biscuits as a substitute and they told me it was sold out.   Tonight I went back. We waited 15 minutes to be seated (with no one ahead of us) even though there were empty seats and I was told our wait would be short. Staff was nonchalant about clearing and cleaning the tables that were recently vacated by previous patrons.    I proceeded to the men's restroom once we were seated, and to my surprise there was absolutely no hand soap! I asked staff could i get some soap. After 5 minutes of waiting near the restroom for soap, I saw staff approach the manager who gave a nonchalant gesture toward my direction. Staff then gave a shameful look in my direction and went back to preparing tables. I waited another couple of minutes and approached the same staff, who then went on another search. This time the hostess went to the restroom to check. When she came out of the women's room without soap I asked her for soap. She said ok. Then the manager who wouldn't move to help me before finally comes in my direction to apologize. He blamed the lack of soap on the mall being closed at the time and said they're waiting for a shipment. I didn't believe him. Needless to say, a restaurant should always have soap in the restroom at all times, otherwise the restaurant itself should be closed.    Another 2-3 minutes later the manager comes back with soap from the kitchen. I waited for soap so long until my sister who accompanied me thought something bad possibly happened and told my son to check on me.   I ordered chicken and biscuits. The waitress was pleasant, but my chicken and mashed potatoes was lukewarm, and the biscuits were cold. I was afraid to send it back after the poor service I already received. I begrudgingly ate it with a resolve that I would never return to this establishment again.   This place is giving the Cheesecake Factory franchise a bad reputation. They really need to do something about this. If anyone wants to try Cheesecake Factory, don't go to the Newport Mall Jersey City location.

Tim K.,"North Bergen, NJ",8,12,8,5.0,1/3/2016,"My wife and I came here Christmas eve. and the place was packed! We were excited that a new place opened so we tried it and glad we did. It was about a 40 min wait as we expected since its new and on a holiday night but didn't mind. Service: The waiter...Tyquan...was extremely friendly and got down low enough so we were all face to face. He answered our questions and ordered our meal. He served us well, asked how everything was going 15 minutes after we started and the two of us were pleased. 5 stars here Meals: I ordered their Louisiana chicken, My wife got the Thai glazed salmon . The taste was great !!!  The amount of pasta they gave me was in abundance compared to other places and it was spicy! My wife loved her Salmon and the two of us could""nt  finish. The serving size is huge. 5 stars Setting inside : Dimmed lights, very cozy and unique shape. There is outside seating if you wish. I highly recommend this place if you don't mind the wait. After all, if this place was bad, there wouldn't be so many people inside. That tells you something. Cheesecake: How many varieties do you like? there are so many that you can try a different type each day and you will be done with the menu in 3-4 weeks. The taste is great .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=180
Jennifer M.,"Honolulu, HI",337,2,1,1.0,2/15/2017,"I am a regular at the Cheesecake Factory in my hometown in CA, I have never had a problem... until now. My friends and I came in on 2/13 for  lunch around 2:30pm, The restaurant was quite empty. Our server came right up and was quite attentive at first. He went ahead took our order, 20+min later no food and no server in site. Our drinks were empty we had to ask other employees for refills. Finally, our waiter saw us and noticed we had no food, he was like let me go check but never made eye contact or asked if we needed anything. It took approximately 40 min for our food to arrive at our table. This is unacceptable for a restaurant that wAs not busy. The food was dropped off and again our server went missing. Each rare time he would pass by we would try just over look our table. We wanted to order dessert and once again it was a mission to locate our server. He finally came by took our dessert ordered and dropped off our check. When I took a look at my check I noticed that he Charged me for a dinner dish when I specifically told him the lunch size. When I brought it to his attention he wanted to start arguing with me saying I was wrong. He finally sorry let me get that fixed. After fixing the check our dessert took approx 15 min to arrive at our table as well as our revised check. I forgot to add that the server was also waiting the table behind us and he also messed up their order. In the end, this has been clearly the worst experience I have had at a Cheesecake Factory and I have been to many all over the country. I still love the food and hopefully this was just an off day for the server. My friend and I are previous restaurant workers and we know when we are receiving bad service and we both agreed this clearly was horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=180
Jamielee N.,"Henderson, NV",211,9,9,5.0,12/29/2015,This is new to Jersey City so everyone wants to come and try out the food so don't be surprised if it's packed when you come inside. They opened December 8th so it's always busy when you come in. The hosts were very welcoming and accommodating. The servers were so polite and attentive to my table. The managers are very friendly. I definitely recommend you coming in and trying out the food and cheesecake despite the really long wait. It is definitely worth it despite what others say. You should definitely try it out and have a taste for your self!!! I recommend the steak diane and the Godiva cheesecake for sure!  P.S. Come around 2-3ish pm.

Food came out just as ordered which is another plus.

It's ridiculous how little alcohol it takes to give me a nice buzz.  Finishing a single drink is hard for me to do.  I downed a huge Caribbean style drink and didn't feel a thing, which means only one thing .... their drinks have hardly any alcohol in them.  So we finally order dinner.  I had a craving for the fish & chips.  It was so greasy I couldn't eat it.  What's worse is that when I brought it home my pets wouldn't touch it either.  It came with fries (which I normally don't eat) but since I wasn't eating that fish, I tried a couple.  They were also greasy and tasted just like fish.  It turns out they cook the fish and the fries in the same oil.  In short, it was a big waste of time and money.  I was very disappointed. The waited was hard to get hold of, so I didn't bother complaining.  He didn't seem like he would care anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=200

I told the waiter that my dish is undercook, he stated ""I will have my manager come and talk to you"". So They took my plate and made me a new one. When my food came everything was fine, I been waiting for the manager for more then 30 mins now. Please note that the store wasn't even busy. With that being said, if it was my restaurant and I made a dish that was undercook. I would have a manager bring out the new plate in a heartbeat.

Dan G.,"Clifton, NJ",1,6,,5.0,12/9/2015,I worked at cheesecake factory for several years in college. I can say first hand from seeing the behind the scenes at several restaurants that the cheesecake factory is top quality. The restaurant has very high standards for the quality of their food and service. The food is all prepared fresh daily along with fresh fish. The sauces are prepared to order. The dressings are made from scratch. It is all delicious. My favorite thing is the variety. There are over 250 items on the menu including skinilicious items and vegatarian items. Do not be turned off by the wait- there is a reason for it. The food is great and they try their best to not send food to the table that is not up to their standards. I've personally seen a manager try a sauce for a dish and make the kitchen remake the whole thing. The manager chose to make the guest wait for a quality product and even bought them dessert after explaining why they were making them wait.

The decor is beautiful, more modern than a few of the Cheesecake Factory's ive been to which is a plus because some look dated. The music played was nice, Selena Gomez, India Aire, Adele so it was a mix of r&b and pop with the occasional Christmas song as it is December. My server was Tey. He was handsome and kind but spoke way too low. I could hardly hear him sitting a few inches away from him. His trainer Grecia was awesome. She was kind, attentive and cheerful. It's nice to be served by someone who knows their stuff. The session included a complimentary beverage, a shared appetizer, entree and shared desert. For drinks I had a Blueberry Mojito, it wasn't to berry-y or minty. It was the perfect blend and refreshing. My mom had a glass of moscato and they're not stingy with the pour. The appetizer we chose was the fried chicken sliders, they were huge! and spicy. My entree was the fettuccini Alfredo which I didn't like. the noodles were tooo chewy and the sauce was underseasoned. My mom had the everything pizza pie which she enjoyed. it had pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach and something else i can't recall. On the the cheesecake which is always the best part.

I Walked in and was at at 4:11pm i was sat/dining alone i went through the menu and decided on my full order quickly since i love cheesecake factory and at 430pm i proceeded to walk out because no one greeted or even acknowledged after the hostess sat me... its a monday afternoon on halloween the restaurant was empty and there were only 4 ppl at the bar. TERRIBLE SERVICE! OR NON EXISTANT SERVICE!! MY FIRST TIME IN THIS MALL AND IN NJ AND WHAT AN EMPRESSION!  I FREQUENT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY IN NYC, WHERE IM FROM AND EVEN THERE IN A SUPER BUSY NIGHT THEY AT LEAST SAY HELLO OR BRING WATER... what made it worst was i see servers bringing out food and serving other tables so i was patient but once i noticed staff walking paste over and over was when i walked and and of course no one even noticed. I wont blame it on me being latino since i hope in 2016 i wasnt being ignored because of that but i was the only single person there not hard to spot.

We came saturday night and expected a long wait, which was fine, but then our buzzers rang and the girl in the front of the restaurant said we were ready, after telling us it's a 15 min wait. Then she told us it was a mistake and the table wasn't ready, which would've been nice to know before making us walk the whole way thru the restaurant.  Then our waiter came and took our orders but it took forever for him to come. I had to flag someone else down twice to get the waiter. I ordered a drink and he never delivered my drink. We ordered the hot cheese and spinach dip as the appetizer and it was great. I was then ready to order the main entree and it took him at least a half an hour to come. I ordered my entree (the farfalle with chicken and garlic) and it was very tasty. Had absolutely no complaints and the portion sizes were reasonable. I asked him again for my drink (Mai Tai margarita) and he said he would get it. Second time around, STILL no drink and I decided to just call it quits. Then when we were ready to pay, he did not come back until for another 15 minutes. We assumed to just pay one front register then, until the waiter FINALLY came and said ""where do you think you're going""? I told him we were going to pay in the front and he rudely said ""NO, YOU PAY ME!!"" Well, yes, but you never showed up, so we assumed you forgot, and were just going to go the register which was right next to our table.  Should not have even given him a 20% tip given his attitude and his ability to forget my Mai Tai cocktail TWICE. The service was terrible, and while the food was good, the service alone will not make us come back.

I love the cheesecake factory which is why I chose to take my girlfriend here but this location was awful. We usually go to the one in short hills, and we never have an issue! We waited almost an hour to get a table which I understand being that it was Friday night and valentines weekend, but to wait an hour and then have a bad experience was not how I wanted to spend my valentines dinner. First the bread was hard and burnt, then we were served water without straws! My girlfriend ordered lugini pasta which she figured would be long spaghetti type noodles but it was cut up and honesty looked like a plate of cabbage..she barely ate any of it. I got the 4 cheese pasts which was delicious and cant ever complain about that. I ordered coffee and the waited forgot the milk.

Juan P.,"Cambridge, MA",0,1,,2.0,7/8/2016,"Disclaimer: I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. In general(although last time was ~4-5 years back). Not this one. First, food was mediocre. Bread was not warm and little stiffer than usual. Chicken in pasta was overcooked. Carbonara was tasteless. No dressing in salad. Buffalo chicken wings was the only decent dish. Second, service was atrocious. First waitress told me ""beers are $4."" ""Any of the beers here?"" ""Yes"" ""four dollars?"" ""Yes"". Later check comes and price was $7-9 dollars each. The best part was the joker manager: ""sorry for the misinformation"" ""so what are we going to do about it?"" ""Sorry can't do anything"". ""Ok whatever"". It's one of those places where you might hear ""sorry I don't know. I just work here."" Interestingly, 2 min later our second waitress brings a check that has at least some adjustment to the price (She is great. Thank you). Third, most of the negative experience due to the incompetent and arrogant service could have been avoided if Cheesecake Factory didn't try to desperately increase their same-store-sales by not bothering to show prices for the alcoholic beverages on the menu.

So we move up to the desk, and the host decided that now would be a good time to start shooting the breeze with her friend, (could've been a coworker not sure on that) for what ends up being 5 minutes. She completely ignores our presence. For 5 whole minutes. Now, we are the only two standing there. No one blocking her view of us. No way she could've missed us. She just chose to ignore us. When she was finally done with her very important  convo, we ask to be seated.  There's a wait because they're ""short staffed"". Mind you the restaurant was probably half filled, if that. Plenty of available tables! We were so beyond annoyed at this point that we decide to buy a cheesecake and get the hell out of Dodge.

Had a 50 minute wait for a table, it was pretty busy but we did see tables that were free but just not being flipped quickly enough. When we eventually got seated, our server was nice and took drinks/food order, the drinks took a fair amount of time to be brought to the table and the order was not complete. Probably took around 20-30 minutes to receive complete drinks order. Appetizers took around 30-40 minutes to be brought up, we had literally just finished our Apps when they brought the entree's up. The app plates had not even been cleared, the entree orders were wrong (One contained meat for a vegetarian...Even though we made it absolutely clear that the order should not contain meat) for two of the party and one was sent back completely. I just lived with the mistake on mine as i did not want to wait an eternity for it to be changed. One of the managers came over and comp'd one app and took the entree off the bill that had to be sent back due to length of time it took to receive the food and then the lack of break between courses. I get that this place is new and they are ironing out the kinks but we were hearing that other tables were being comp'd food due to the wait times. There are a ton of staff working at the restaurant but there just seems to be a lack of direction for them...Maybe management needs to step in more and direct as it seems that no one seems to know what they are doing there.

Soo sorry!! No prob.....salad is completed with more dressing and yummy just like always.  just like all other visits to other locations (I travel for a living so).   Ordered a tasty farfalle cream chicken and roasted garlic dish.  So tasty.   Sadly it was WAY short on the chicken.  Not sure if this is corporate policy or new mgmt trying to impress corporate.  We left here in November and are back now for our season.  This location has opened since we left and WE were exited to try out the new spot as we  love the experience most always  elsewhere.  So indeed a few more times at this location (2min walk from marina) will be in order.  Usually newly opened restaurants don't hold back on the ingredients hope this is just an off night.  Love this place usually    Fire and oak has been our go to for 10 years now.  Just saying.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=260

I've visited other locations Riverside and Willowbrook. This is not an uncommon wait time for a weekend around 4:30pm. This particular location is a nice addition to Newport Mall & Jersey City residents. They didn't offer to validate parking however you can go to the member service to get a discount of $1. Ambiance is ok, food is mediocre lighting is very dim inside. I went on a weekend, you can imagine the traffic. Our server Shaqueria was very attentive and visited our table often about (4 times ). I appreciated her kindness towards us as I informed her this was my first visit at this branch. She seated us comfortably in a section where it wasn't so noisy. Several managers visited our table briefly to ensure we were well taken care of. This is a high volume restaurant that will be successful. Keep smiling associates on the front line &  thank your guests for their patience and business. This is the key to having them return.

Anon A.,"Jersey City, NJ",6,4,,2.0,1/24/2016,"So, we finally went to the Cheesecake Factory after hearing all the hoopla and seeing the crazy long lines. I figured since it was the day after the big storm, it shouldn't be as bad. We waited 20 minutes for a table - not bad. Then downhill from there...The waiter was nice, but terrible. I had to ask 4 different waiters for basic things like - water, ketchup, salad dressing, cream, coffee refill 2x, strawberries 2x, cheesecake 2x. The old fashioned burger was terrible - I asked for medium well and received medium rare. The seasonings on the burger were nasty also. I couldn't even eat it. I was about to not leave a tip, but the waiter apologized for poor service saying they were understaffed. So, I left a 15% tip anyway. However, I will not be returning!

We were not surprised at all so we took a pager and waited out the hour. We got the page on time and went to claim our table. However the host took my fiances name down as Cory which is far from his name, luckily my fiance heard her say cory when she first asked his name and so he remembered that the table for 2 under cory was actually for us lmao. We were seated and then our waitress greeted us promptly. I forgot our waitress name but she also has a cousin who is a waitress there as well and they look like sisters.She was sweet, attentive and funny.They did a good job building the restaurant hard to believe payhalf used to be here it is really nice. But they should have built a bigger waiting area at the host desk because it was jam packed. We had the loaded nachos, crab cakes, macaroni and cheese balls and red velvet cheesecake for dessert. The food was quite tasty but the service was excellent, I hope its not just because it is brand new because everyone was friendly accommodating and checked on us frequently great customer experience.

James B.,"Hoboken, NJ",244,6,,1.0,3/24/2016,"Had an early dinner there today. Waiter was frazzled and forgot to put in orders, food was cold and terrible and soda was flat....worst part... I left my wallet on the table by accident. I take full responsibility for that. I quickly realized I left it and went back to the restaurant.  The waiter claimed he found it on the ground ""kicked under a table"" and gave it in to the manager. After a few moments the waiter returns with my wallet but...All OF THE MONEY THAT WAS IN IT WAS TAKEN over 100.00!!! The manager claimed the waiter never reported the wallet to him. So he lied about that. Obviously the waiter planned to take my wallet home. When I arrived he had a change of heart (or got scared) lied and gave me the wallet back but had already taken the money. That is fucked!! I am glad I have my wallet and credit cards back but really??? I was thrilled my wallet was there and returned but the experience completely soured by the blatant lying and theft of he staff.  The manager said he would investigate it but we all know what that means. So it basically cost me 100 bucks to realize I will never return to that establishment as long as I have a mouth to eat with. I was given a gift card as an xmass gift. I used the card for the food at least. Thanks for the gift of lousy food, failed service and thievery!!! Merry xmass to me. Never go here!! The manager seemed sweet and concerned. Said he would call with news but never did. Corporate, if you read this I expect a 100 gift card on you asap which I will donate to the homeless. The host staff were extremely lovely!!

We came saturday night and expected a long wait, which was fine, but then our buzzers rang and the girl in the front of the restaurant said we were ready, after telling us it's a 15 min wait. Then she told us it was a mistake and the table wasn't ready, which would've been nice to know before making us walk the whole way thru the restaurant.  Then our waiter came and took our orders but it took forever for him to come. I had to flag someone else down twice to get the waiter. I ordered a drink and he never delivered my drink. We ordered the hot cheese and spinach dip as the appetizer and it was great. I was then ready to order the main entree and it took him at least a half an hour to come. I ordered my entree (the farfalle with chicken and garlic) and it was very tasty. Had absolutely no complaints and the portion sizes were reasonable. I asked him again for my drink (Mai Tai margarita) and he said he would get it. Second time around, STILL no drink and I decided to just call it quits. Then when we were ready to pay, he did not come back until for another 15 minutes. We assumed to just pay one front register then, until the waiter FINALLY came and said ""where do you think you're going""? I told him we were going to pay in the front and he rudely said ""NO, YOU PAY ME!!"" Well, yes, but you never showed up, so we assumed you forgot, and were just going to go the register which was right next to our table.  Should not have even given him a 20% tip given his attitude and his ability to forget my Mai Tai cocktail TWICE. The service was terrible, and while the food was good, the service alone will not make us come back.

We waited almost an hour to get a table which I understand being that it was Friday night and valentines weekend, but to wait an hour and then have a bad experience was not how I wanted to spend my valentines dinner. First the bread was hard and burnt, then we were served water without straws! My girlfriend ordered lugini pasta which she figured would be long spaghetti type noodles but it was cut up and honesty looked like a plate of cabbage..she barely ate any of it. I got the 4 cheese pasts which was delicious and cant ever complain about that. I ordered coffee and the waited forgot the milk.

Juan P.,"Cambridge, United States",0,1,,2.0,8/7/2016,"Disclaimer: I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. In general(although last time was ~4-5 years back). Not this one. First, food was mediocre. Bread was not warm and little stiffer than usual. Chicken in pasta was overcooked. Carbonara was tasteless. No dressing in salad. Buffalo chicken wings was the only decent dish. Second, service was atrocious. First waitress told me ""beers are $4."" ""Any of the beers here?"" ""Yes"" ""four dollars?"" ""Yes"". Later check comes and price was $7-9 dollars each. The best part was the joker manager: ""sorry for the misinformation"" ""so what are we going to do about it?"" ""Sorry can't do anything"". ""Ok whatever"". It's one of those places where you might hear ""sorry I don't know. I just work here."" Interestingly, 2 min later our second waitress brings a check that has at least some adjustment to the price (She is great. Thank you). Third, most of the negative experience due to the incompetent and arrogant service could have been avoided if Cheesecake Factory didn't try to desperately increase their same-store-sales by not bothering to show prices for the alcoholic beverages on the menu.

She completely ignores our presence. For 5 whole minutes. Now, we are the only two standing there. No one blocking her view of us. No way she could've missed us. She just chose to ignore us.

Had a 50 minute wait for a table, it was pretty busy but we did see tables that were free but just not being flipped quickly enough. When we eventually got seated, our server was nice and took drinks/food order, the drinks took a fair amount of time to be brought to the table and the order was not complete. Probably took around 20-30 minutes to receive complete drinks order. Appetizers took around 30-40 minutes to be brought up, we had literally just finished our Apps when they brought the entree's up. The app plates had not even been cleared, the entree orders were wrong (One contained meat for a vegetarian...Even though we made it absolutely clear that the order should not contain meat) for two of the party and one was sent back completely. I just lived with the mistake on mine as i did not want to wait an eternity for it to be changed. One of the managers came over and comp'd one app and took the entree off the bill that had to be sent back due to length of time it took to receive the food and then the lack of break between courses. I get that this place is new and they are ironing out the kinks but we were hearing that other tables were being comp'd food due to the wait times. There are a ton of staff working at the restaurant but there just seems to be a lack of direction for them...Maybe management needs to step in more and direct as it seems that no one seems to know what they are doing there.

No prob.....salad is completed with more dressing and yummy just like always.  just like all other visits to other locations (I travel for a living so).   Ordered a tasty farfalle cream chicken and roasted garlic dish.  So tasty.   Sadly it was WAY short on the chicken.  Not sure if this is corporate policy or new mgmt trying to impress corporate.  We left here in November and are back now for our season.  This location has opened since we left and WE were exited to try out the new spot as we  love the experience most always  elsewhere.  So indeed a few more times at this location (2min walk from marina) will be in order.  Usually newly opened restaurants don't hold back on the ingredients hope this is just an off night.  Love this place usually    Fire and oak has been our go to for 10 years now.  Just saying.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=260
Manoj G.,"New York, United States",1,9,,1.0,7/1/2016,"I live close by and when I saw a new restaurant had opened up, I thought of checking it out. I was in thew newport mall and walked by the area where the server was standing by her computer. I asked her if I could take a look at the menu, the multiple copies of which were sitting right by her. She said ""no, you have to come through the front to take a look at the menu"".

Maeve K.,"Brooklyn, United States",0,15,2,1.0,2/4/2016,I read the warnings about the bad service and disorganization but figured they would have it worked out by now - I was wrong! We were quoted a 30min wait and after an hour we had to leave and go upstairs to the food court otherwise we would have missed our movie. There were several empty tables that were still messy from there previous guests and most people there all looked the same - frustrated at either waiting for their table or waiting for their food.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=260

Cynthia C.,"Edgewater, United States",114,30,98,5.0,2/1/2016,"Lauralie greeted us advised wait time would be 1 hour handed us a pager we were able to roam around until it was time. I've visited other locations Riverside and Willowbrook. This is not an uncommon wait time for a weekend around 4:30pm. This particular location is a nice addition to Newport Mall & Jersey City residents. They didn't offer to validate parking however you can go to the member service to get a discount of $1. Ambiance is ok, food is mediocre lighting is very dim inside. I went on a weekend, you can imagine the traffic. Our server Shaqueria was very attentive and visited our table often about (4 times ). I appreciated her kindness towards us as I informed her this was my first visit at this branch. She seated us comfortably in a section where it wasn't so noisy. Several managers visited our table briefly to ensure we were well taken care of. This is a high volume restaurant that will be successful. Keep smiling associates on the front line &  thank your guests for their patience and business. This is the key to having them return. I look forward to my next week day visit.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=260
Anon A.,"Jersey City, United States",6,4,,2.0,24/1/2016,"So, we finally went to the Cheesecake Factory after hearing all the hoopla and seeing the crazy long lines. I figured since it was the day after the big storm, it shouldn't be as bad. We waited 20 minutes for a table - not bad. Then downhill from there...The waiter was nice, but terrible. I had to ask 4 different waiters for basic things like - water, ketchup, salad dressing, cream, coffee refill 2x, strawberries 2x, cheesecake 2x. The old fashioned burger was terrible - I asked for medium well and received medium rare. The seasonings on the burger were nasty also. I couldn't even eat it. I was about to not leave a tip, but the waiter apologized for poor service saying they were understaffed. So, I left a 15% tip anyway. However, I will not be returning! People must like this place for the booze! We will stick with Johnny Rockets upstairs.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=260

Brianna A.,"New York, United States",17,17,1,4.0,28/12/2015,"We came to cheesecake factory on Sunday December 20th, it had been open for a week at that point. We were promptly informed there was an hour wait. We were not surprised at all so we took a pager and waited out the hour. We got the page on time and went to claim our table. However the host took my fiances name down as Cory which is far from his name, luckily my fiance heard her say cory when she first asked his name and so he remembered that the table for 2 under cory was actually for us lmao. We were seated and then our waitress greeted us promptly. I forgot our waitress name but she also has a cousin who is a waitress there as well and they look like sisters.She was sweet, attentive and funny.They did a good job building the restaurant hard to believe payhalf used to be here it is really nice. But they should have built a bigger waiting area at the host desk because it was jam packed. We had the loaded nachos, crab cakes, macaroni and cheese balls and red velvet cheesecake for dessert. The food was quite tasty but the service was excellent, I hope its not just because it is brand new because everyone was friendly accommodating and checked on us frequently great customer experience. We will be back in the next two weeks",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=260
James B.,"Hoboken, United States",244,6,,1.0,24/3/2016,"Had an early dinner there today. Waiter was frazzled and forgot to put in orders, food was cold and terrible and soda was flat....worst part... I left my wallet on the table by accident. I take full responsibility for that. I quickly realized I left it and went back to the restaurant.  The waiter claimed he found it on the ground ""kicked under a table"" and gave it in to the manager. After a few moments the waiter returns with my wallet but...All OF THE MONEY THAT WAS IN IT WAS TAKEN over 100.00!!! The manager claimed the waiter never reported the wallet to him. So he lied about that. Obviously the waiter planned to take my wallet home. When I arrived he had a change of heart (or got scared) lied and gave me the wallet back but had already taken the money. That is fucked!! I am glad I have my wallet and credit cards back but really??? I was thrilled my wallet was there and returned but the experience completely soured by the blatant lying and theft of he staff.  The manager said he would investigate it but we all know what that means. So it basically cost me 100 bucks to realize I will never return to that establishment as long as I have a mouth to eat with. I was given a gift card as an xmass gift. I used the card for the food at least. Thanks for the gift of lousy food, failed service and thievery!!! Merry xmass to me. Never go here!! The manager seemed sweet and concerned. Said he would call with news but never did. Corporate, if you read this I expect a 100 gift card on you asap which I will donate to the homeless. The host staff were extremely lovely!!

Christie T.,"Randall Manor, United States",6,18,12,3.0,1/1/2018,The wait was not terrible and the staff was extremely friendly. The food was pretty Good but not amazing and it's expected but we have always had a great meal the few times we have gone. The pink lemonade drink was not my style but sounded good so I ordered it And the waitress was kind enough to switch It out for a glass of wine it was just very sweet. The loaded potato ball things were so good as well as the flat bread pizza. Dinner my husband absolutely didn't enjoy his but they changed it out and he got a new dish (to go) by the time he got it. Mine and the kids were just fine. I got 2 cheesecakes to go and just had some today and a piece of paper or something was inside of it so I am not happy about that but not much I can do being it was to go and 2 days later.

Christa Y.,"New York, United States",109,103,10,2.0,8/1/2018,"Food: The mushroom croquettes and herb crusted salmon were average. The Jamaican shrimp and chicken was a disaster. For a $20 entree, there are 3 small pieces of shrimp. The dish is described as ""very spicy"" on the menu, but tastes almost sweet with no hint of spice. The chicken taquitos were cold and tasteless with no hint of chicken in them.  Drinks: Absolutely watered down. Service: The server (Dominique K) seemed disinterested, took a while to get the bread, forgot the straw and had to be asked 3 times to get us a box at the end. We saw staff at other tables being much more friendly and attentive to their patrons. Overall: Will never repeat. The Newport Mall has so many better options NOTE TO MANAGEMENT: It is misleading to calculate ""suggested gratuity"" on the after-tax receipt total.

Chao X.,"Manhattan, United States",67,135,630,4.0,12/12/2017,Occasion: Casual lunch It was one of the days I craved pasta for lunch! So a colleague and I went to Cheesecake Factory to fulfill our pasta starvation!  Overall: Maybe it's because I didn't expect much from Cheesecake Factory but to me the food was actually more than decent! We shared 1 Jambalaya Chicken linguini and 1 huge quac with chips. The portion was so huge that we were so full and couldn't finish all of them.  Highly recommend:  Jambalaya Chicken Linguini Two kinds of linguini - regular and green - were covered with delicious sauce! Chicken was cooked perfectly - charred outside but juicy and tender inside! Definitely get this when you get a chance! But only large portion is available for this dish so recommend sharing among at least 2 friends  Guacamole with chips Even though it's not anything special - the chips are freshly fried and guac was well flavored! The portion is more than enough to feed 3 people.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city

We came here for lunch, and when dinner time came, despite not being hungry, we scrolled through Seamless for half an hour until we decided to order from the CF twice in one day. The food from this chain is alway decent but never exceeds expectations other than with its sheer portion size. The inaptly named Skinnylicious menu should just be the regular menu. Even the Superfoods section consists of dishes well over 1k calories. Flavorwise, both the vegan cobb and the salmon salad are tasty, and so is the free bread.

There seems to always be a HUGE crowd at this establishment which is good. Luckily I was able to find a place in the Bar to sit and not wait on that long wait list to get a table.

The Cheesecake Factory and general was where I first discovered a love for sliders. I love the table bread here and recently tried the Truffle bacon grilled cheese appetizer. It was sinfully good. My girlfriend and I shared a filet mignon medium and they let us substitute the mashed potatoes and beans for asparagus and grilled broccoli. The asparagus came at a small of charge though, but that was okay. We actually then order dessert and got Godiva brownie sundae- it was really good. I typically order from the skinnylicious menu, but was craving a protein other than chicken. The Fiji Waters were a bit expensive at about $ 4 a bottle.

The food has been pretty good so far with my personal favorite being the southern chicken sliders. They offer a few lemonade mixes but all seem to be a little to sweet.

Avocado Toast- 1/5         It is one of my favorite dish and here at cheesecake it is the worst thing I ever had. The bread was too rough even the avocado spread on it could not make it soggy. Tuscan Chicken - 3/5          It has very small pieces of chicken breast and the plate was covered in oil and lemon juice. Not at all tasty.

They give me a lot, though let me tell you, my stomach regrets it the next day. My go to here is the chicken bellagio, but their chicken sandwich and eggplant parm are my faves too. I usually get cheesecake too (tiramisu is my favorite), but this time, I opted for the apple strudel. It was pretty darn good!

They hand out buzzers so you can shop around while waiting for the table. Free bread: nice and warm! Whole wheat and white. Chicken Madeira: chicken, melted cheese, asparagus and mushrooms in a wine sauce. Comes with mashed potatoes. It's pretty good, although I felt the wine sauce was a little too sweet. Louisiana style chicken and pasta: Parmesan crusted chicken over bow tie pasta. The chicken was super crispy and great, but the pasta was bland. This dish showed up as the #1 dish to order in Cheesecake Factory in my research. I was surprised when it didn't turn out as good.  Tiramisu cheesecake: when tiramisu and cheesecake married and had a child, this is it. Coffee-soaked lady finger bottoms, mascarpone-cheesecake filling and topped with a layer of chocolate powdered mascarpone cream. My only small complaint is the chocolate cream swirl is too sweet (you can remove it if u want - it's not mixed into the cake). Our 2 entrees could probably feed 3. We brought home leftovers.

Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, United States",58,116,18,3.0,21/10/2017,"This review is for both dine in and takeout.  My first experience here was dine in, my date and I were seated promptly, waitress was very helpful and well mannered. As an appetizer, we chose the Tex Mex egg rolls. I ordered the farfalle with pancetta, mushrooms, and chicken (minus the peas and carmelized onions that usually come with it). I also opted for spaghettini instead of farfalle and my waiter graciously accepted my alterations. My date went for the chicken alfredo. Both dishes came to us piping hot, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. The Cheesecake Factory goodness that I fondly remember from years ago. Unfortunately my delivery experience was far from as pleasant as the dine in. Last night, via DoorDash, my date and I went for TCF again. He went for the turkey burger with cheese and french fries on the side. I went for the same pasta, instead I got shrimp instead of chicken in it. The food came fairly cold, there were still onions in mine, the shrimp was tough and cold, and they didn't put any pancetta in even though I didn't ask for that to be removed. There was also no sauce in it. It seemed like they made the dish in a pan, drained the remaining sauce and let it sit and dry out for 30 minutes. My date's burger was a little cold but seemingly good, although the fries were no dice; soggy and cold.

Amy L.,"Brooklyn, United States",29,159,204,4.0,16/7/2017,"Surprised to see a 3/5 for this joint...but it was also my first time here. My friends and I came from NYC just to eat here. I was blown away; never have I given chain restaurants any credit, in fact, it has always been one disappointment after another. But the incredibly high number of calories of each drink, entree, and dessert on this menu only made me want more. I don't really remember the names of the plates we got, but I was surprised to see them range from pasta to Thai to good ol' American. I loved my shrimp pasta and got a good kick out of my friend's spicy Thai chicken (actually don't even know if it's called that). So the lesson is: don't be alarmed that you'll go over your calorie intake in less than 45 minutes and don't let the 1000 items on the menu dissuade you from ordering too much :) Better advice: don't wear skinny jeans to this meal. Oh, and the cheesecake IS amazing. Touché.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=20
Satyam K.,"West New York, United States",8,22,17,1.0,2/9/2017,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! I would like to repeat what so many ppl have already said.  This place has HORRIBLE SERVICE. Pathetic !  The order took 35 minutes for two dishes !!! How much time does it take to make Spicy Chicken over rice fellas ?????  They say the dish took longer than usual to make. After 35 min, all We got was cold food. They have no explanation to that. It only means that the food was ready sometime back and they didn't get it to the table. The food was taken back to kitchen and when the re-served one dish had too much salt in it. By then our appetite was over and we got food packed cuz we couldn't eat. They sent their manager to talk to us who turned out to be another waiter.  Bunch of a**holes and liars work here. The whole management & staff needs to be 'fired'. Even after all this, I had to PAY for the late food !!  We are never coming back. And neither We will recommend this place to anyone. There is a reason why this place got 2.5 star as compared to other cheesecake factories. Re-Edit after reading other reviews-- Cheesecake Factory Guest Services ! Plz don't bother apologizing for poor service or thanking for honest feedback.

The ambiance is like its other locations, very cozy and intimate.  It does get crowded and you might be waiting some time for a table during peek dining hours.   The food is flavorful a little on the pricey side but it's a better option then most chain restaurants if u don't feel like cooking.  Don't forget to grab yourself a slice of cheesecake heaven.  I don't even like cheesecake or sweets like that but I tried a slice of the salted caramel cheesecake.  WOW!!!!

Whenever I go, I always order the fried cheese, avocado toast, and their chipotle pasta! I would rate them 5/5! However, the last time we went, not only did our waiter forget about our order for a half hour, we ordered their new dish called ""Korean style cauliflower"" and it came really cold and soggy.

It is not the first time we experienced the extremely long waiting for the food. But this time is the most disappointed experience. The waiter placed the wrong order for us. Before they brought the wrong food, we already have waited for 40min. When he kept telling us, it was just 5min away. Then what happened after 5min was just another 5min. He kept saying that it was someone else ordered the wrong food and overrided his order. But he couldn't explain what happened. So don't go there if you don't have enough time to wait.  P.S.

She seemed very nice, smiled and Took our order. Then I barely saw her. I was with two kids and my boyfriend. After the kids food came she got lost. She never brought me the water I asked for, for the whole table. She never came to bring us bread. She didn't bring me the drink I ordered which was a smoothie. She comes back in what seemed like forever to me and I then had to ask her for bread because she didn't seem like she was ever going to bring it and I felt like I was starving to death. Still didn't bring me my water or my drink. Didn't come back to check if the kids food was okay or if they needed anything. The kids are almost done with their food and she STILL didn't come back with my water or bread or anything. By this point I was BEYOND frustrated and starving half to death. Another waiter by the name Yoval not sure his position but must of noticed the frustration in my face because he randomly came up to us and asked if we would want some bread. He was awesome compared to my waiter who lacked bunch of waiter skills. Then she came with my drink after she saw him helping us. Not sure if she had too many tables or if she just kept forgetting about us because she didn't even apologize the times she did happen to come back. He also came around to see if we needed refills on our drinks. She came and gave us the dessert menu and then never came back. The same gentleman kept looking at us and eventually came to see what we wanted to order. Im not going to let one sour apple ruin the tree so my waiter may have been horrible at customer service but the food was BEYONDDDDDDDD GOOD. I had the hibachi steak with mashx2 And some fried shrimp on top and it was to die for. I don't think I even stoped to breath lol my boyfriend had the chicken with steak combo with mash and Mac and cheese on the side . Which was also very good .

Briana C.,"Jersey City, United States",149,94,261,3.0,3/12/2016,"Food was good as per usual for this restaurant chain. However hostess service was not only slow but incompetent. They gave us a buzzer for a legit two min wait. Then they brought us to two tables that were 1) occupied and 2) not yet cleaned. Before actually being able to seat us. They hostess was unapologetic and made us walk all the way back to the hostess station (past plenty of open/clean tables). When they finally sat us the floor was filthy and table was sticky. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 130 and the place was not exceptionally crowded at all. The family who eventually was seated next to us had a baby and requested a booth which they did not give them. The mom was requesting a booth and the hostess told them they would have to go back and wait again even though the booth across from us was open. Then proceeded to take 15 min to bring them a height chair. The only reason this location didn't get one star was because we had James m. as our server and he made up for the lack of customer service the rest of the team presented with. He was friendly , timely and out order came out exactly as expected. If it wasn't for him our experience would have been regretful. I would recommend checking out the situation at this place before ordering and requesting James' section for great service",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=80

I wish the waitress would have told me. I usually order a different side since I don't like asparagus and have never been charged extra.

We were seated quickly and our server was prompt to take orders and have them out to us. We tried the crab hash, creme brûlée French toast, and monte cristo. All dishes were huge portions and true to form for Cheesecake Factory. The coffee was on the weak side so you're probably better off having your own from one of the places in the mall.

Patty G.,"Jersey City, United States",507,278,417,4.0,11/2/2016,Ive heard mix reviews about this location from their initial launch to some reviews on here already. Came by a few weeks ago with some of my favorite amigos and must say we left super full and satisfied.  We had about a 10 minute wait before being seated which was a little confusing because it was 2pm on a week day and it wasn't a full restaurant. We finally sat at a booth really enjoyed that you can look right into the kitchen as they are busy preparing peoples meals. We were greeted by our waiter who seemed nice.  We orders some apps and cocktails everything came out pretty good. We waiting a while for our food but at this point we really should have just stopped at apps because we were pretty full.  Service was okay nothing majorly great about it. I would definitely come back if I was in the mood for a chain restaurant.

They might as well have made it on an assembly line... one where the salt person was asleep. I hope this was just a night when the main chef was out of the kitchen. If you're an avid Cheesecake Factory fan like me, go to the one in Hackensack where their pasta, steaks, and salads are delectable cohesive dishes.

P S.,"Jersey City, United States",1,6,,1.0,1/7/2017,Firstly I love CF but today we had the worst experience at this location. Usually they accommodate us always. We requested a table which had reg chairs instead of the booth with leather couches because I had a back issue so couldn't sit on the leather couch. Plus we asked for a high chair. This was clearly explained to the manager at the front desk.after making us wait for 20 min they still give us the wrong table. When we requested a reg chair they denied us. They could not accommodate us at all anywhere in the entire restaurant and we had  to leave. They did not even consider accommodating. Not to mention the crying baby.  Really bad CF!!!!

T H.,"Hudson, United States",4,18,,1.0,21/7/2016,"I'd been to several Cheesecake Factory restaurants before and had relatively pleasant experiences, but this one was absolutely the worst...might even be the second worst experience I have ever had at a casual restaurant. Took around 20 minutes to be seated...which was not unheard of. Then it took about 20 minutes for someone to come take our orders. We weren't offered water or bread. Also the silverware was dirty and laying on the bare table (with no napkin)! Finally we place our order for the appetizer and drinks. After about a half hour, we go the drinks, but not the appetizer.  30 MORE minutes pass, and we are wondering where our appetizer (nachos and guac) is. The server (who was very nice), said they accidentally gave it to another table. We then had to wait another 10 minutes to get the appetizer. By the time we got it, our entrees had come out. We didn't even finish the appetizer.  I ordered tasteless, greasy, Chicken Piccata, which looked like something you'd get at an army base. The portions were really small (it was like chicken tenders drenched in greasy butter sauce), and the noodles were overcooked. My friend ordered enchiladas and told me the ones I made at home were better than CCFs. We decided to ask for water, and it took the server 10 more minutes to bring the water!  By this time we were annoyed and just wanted to go. We didn't even order the cheesecake because we wanted to get the hell out of there! We got the check, and they didn't even offer to comp the nachos appetizer.

The hostess who placed me on the wait list never looked up at me, she simple asked named and party size ( that could've been better). That aside , my wait time was not bad , the staff was very friendly . My waitress Mellissa was AMAZING.

Earle H.,"Atlanta, United States",204,168,77,4.0,25/7/2016,"Well, it has probably been about 8 years since I've dined at the Cheesecake Factory.  I generally stay away from chain restaurants but this was the most convenient food nearby and you can't really go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.  The flavor is consistent and the menu is quite extensive to satisfy your taste for just about whatever you may want on a given day. I had the Cobb Salad.  It was pretty good and for those who don't know, The Cheesecake Factory salads can normally feed 2 people easily.  A few other items were being passed around on the table like fried calamari and crab bites, both pretty good appetizers.  And who can forget about their warm bread, especially that pumpernickel loaf. Yum! The tropical-flavored house iced tea is always a welcomed refreshing treat to wash it all down.  I didn't taste the other items that my family order but all I heard was ""nom, nom, nom..."" as we all stuffed our hungry faces so that's always a good sign.  For dessert, we shared the banana cheesecake and the turtle cheesecake.  If you have ever had Cheesecake Factory cheesecake, you know that they don't play when it comes to the cheesecake in terms of the size of their menu and the flavor.   I spent many an evening at The Cheesecake Factory when they first opened and began expanding beyond Atlanta all the way to the San Francisco Bay Area.  All in all, even though I don't visit often nowadays, the Cheesecake Factory still holds a special place in my heart for nostalgia's sake if nothing else and I was happy to find that the food was still what I expected and the martini menu is still on point!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=100

Serena N.,"Jersey City, United States",115,528,7142,2.0,20/8/2016,"We just visited this location and I have to say it was the most disappointing experience at Cheesecake Factory I have ever had. The air is very stale in this restaurant and whomever designed the HVAC did a poor job.  The restaurant also has a mildew like smell. To start, there were a lot of empty tables but the wait was still 15 minutes. We were seated and given menu's. We ordered a passion fruit margarita (served in a martini glass) which was extremely too sweet, again it taste like chemicals and not freshly made. Our server brought us water but for some reason put no ice in it so it was luke warm.  We didn't get any bread, and like the table next to us we had to ask our server for it. For the appetizer we got the zucchini, mushroom and avocado batter dipped ($6.95). There were 2 pieces of avocado and the rest was all soggy mushroom and zucchini pieces. Not good at all. They also threw Parmesan on top of it which made the sogginess worse. For the entree I ordered the Luau Salad which did not taste fresh at all. The salad was wilted and soggy. They also put way too much dressing in the salad. The crisp part was drowning in dressing, which had a chemical taste. Nothing tastes fresh. We decided to try the strawberry cheesecake (since it my husband's first time to Cheesecake Factory) and the strawberries ARE NOT fresh (like the menu states) but drowning in a strawberry concentrate and is extremely sugary and taste like corn syrup. Very disappointing experience. The food sucks as well as the ambiance. Complete waste of $70 (we also were not given an itemized receipt when we asked for the check, and were unable to locate our server to get one).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=100
Howard P.,"New York, United States",109,44,833,4.0,25/1/2016,"So I'm going to give this place a 4-star mostly because the nachos were awesome (perhaps somewhat surprisingly to me... Could've been low expectations sure. But they were tasty!).  After being trapped inside due to snowmageddon, my lady and I came to the mall to relieve some cabin fever. Mostly an empty mall. But Cheesecake Factory was open and we got thirsty. The bar is first come first serve and no seats. Despite seeing many a table open the hostess advised is was a 30 minute wait. We decided to put our name in and grab a drink. Luckily we were able to sit and just order from the bar so we never had to wait.  Drinks (margarita and some Mai tai's) were pretty good. As I said the nachos were delicious.  Service was slow. But could be because they were not expecting much with the storm? I don't know....  They had a tv to see the game if you wanted.  I guess it's a Cheesecake Factory and when you are at the mall it suffices. But get the nachos. And another tip: out your name Down and go shopping.

Once we were seated, the people in the booth behind us were in an argument with their server, who was yelling back at them - so the server was replaced with another who now seemed to have to cover a bigger area. There were 5 of us...we put in our drink order - sodas and lemonades and while the sodas arrived quickly, we waited another 5 minutes for the lemonades. The food seemed to be slow coming out, the appetizers about 30 minutes after we ordered, one which was the wrong item and corrected quickly and the entrees, another 30 minutes later, with 2 of the 5 delayed another few minutes. All in all, we spent over 2 hours when it should have only been 1. While the server was pleasant, I feel that the pace needs to be picked up a bit.

But the wait time also made me expect more...and honestly it was not worth the wait. The waiter was nice and friendly but when I asked her if she could recommend something she said everything was good and they had lots of specialties....umm wrong answer ...sigh. The menu was so long I really wanted a recommendation.  Food: The Fried Macaroni appetizer was incredible. For my entree I ordered the chicken Marsala.

Victoria C.,"New York, United States",330,90,173,4.0,30/3/2016,"Food: B The food here was awesome mostly. We started with the Fried Calamari, and it came with both a garlic aioli and cocktail sauce - super tasty - and I noticed that the squid was very tender. Every time I order fried calamari, it's usually quite tough - it was ~delish~ here. The aioli, I think, consisted mainly of mayo - not complaining about, since it was SO good - but I wish it had been lighter so I didn't immediately feel my arteries clog up after taking one bite. Would have loved to eat more of it. The cocktail sauce was a more refreshing alternative. I actually really enjoy fried calamari with marinara sauce, though, so I wish that they had provided that as well. For our entrees we got the Chicken Bellagio and the Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo. The chicken dish was a breaded chicken breast over angel hair pasta (with a light pesto?) topped with prosciutto and arugula. My boyfriend loved it, and it came in a large portion. He has a good appetite and didn't finish it. Can't say the same about my combo dish, which also came with (a small amount of) mashed potatoes. It wasn't a huge problem for me since I still barely finished it - I was so full from the bread, appetizer and also barely touched the side of fries that I ordered (so unlike me). The presentation of this dish wasn't impressive, since the portions were small and it was spaced out over such a large dish. But the shrimp scampi was cooked very well - the sauce was absolutely delicious. Gotta warn you though, if garlic isn't your thing, I wouldn't get the shrimp scampi. Luckily, I LOVE garlic. As for the salmon, meh - overcooked IMO. I like my salmon with the center still a bit tender/soft, but it was tough/crumbly. The ""herb crusted"" part apparently just meant that some herbs were thrown on top of it. It just didn't look (or taste) that appetizing. A bit disappointing. After dinner, we ordered a slice of the chocolate mousse cheesecake to share, which we've had before, and it was super rich and chocolatey. It was very heavy, so I would recommend ordering a tall glass of milk or something on the side. I could barely eat any since I was so full already, but I really wish I could have eaten more of it. Service: A The service here was great - our waitress was very friendly but not intrusive. She was patient when we needed some time to look at the menu, and she was also good with timing - how much time we needed to look at the menu, when to space out our bread, appetizer, and entrees, etc. Our wine was taking a bit due to a backup at the bar, so she was kind enough to give us a heads up so we weren't left wondering if it was forgotten. She checked up on us to see how our food was after giving us enough time to actually eat a bit (some waiters ask only a moment after setting the food down, and I'm like...I've barely touched my food yet...) Timing is a huge thing when it comes to waiting tables. Good timing makes the patrons feel comfortable, relaxed and able to enjoy their meal; poor timing gives customers an experience where they feel rushed, impatient, and/or uncomfortable or even frustrated. I distinctly noticed that she was very good at her job. Ambiance: B This Cheesecake Factory is a part of the Newport Mall. We were seated in the ""patio"" area, outside the restaurant but inside the halls of the mall. They made sure to ask to make sure it was okay to be seated here. Seems weird since people shopping at the mall walk past you, but it wasn't that bad. I actually thought that we had a bit more privacy here than we would have inside, where it was super busy. I was a little concerned that because we were kind of separate from the rest of the tables, we would be forgotten (it happens) and the waitress would busy herself with the customers in the main area, but it was totally fine - our waitress was very attentive :) *thumbs up* A heads up, the patio area has patio furniture (wrought iron tables and all weather wicker sofas to sit on which was comfortable). Not everyone's cup of tea - some people might like the ""fancier"" vibe inside, but this was totally fine for us, even better since it was quieter and we could have a conversation. Other (Sanitation): C When we were seated, we saw that the table had not been cleaned properly - grease marks all over. After I asked our waitress about it, she sent someone over to wipe it, and the guy apologized. Understandable since the metal that the table was made of made it hard to see whether it was a grease mark or drying water. But what was annoying after that, though, was that they later gave us spoons for our cheesecake (dessert after our meal) that were also not very clean. Both my boyfriend and I took a look at our respective spoons and dipped them into a water glass and wiped them down before we felt comfortable enough to use them... Not ideal, especially after already giving us a table that hadn't been cleaned properly *thumbs down* Overall, I had a great time here and would come back! :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=140

Marianne W.,"New York, United States",5000,940,15318,5.0,31/7/2016,"Today, National Cheesecake Day July 30, 2016 was a four star experience. From the time we entered the restaurant we were smiled at and greeted by friendly employees. My daughter asked for a booth for two. We were seated promptly near the kitchen area. Better to be closer to the food!! We looked over the menu and made our decision. We were told out server would be with us soon. I assumed he was the server assisting a huge party of about twelve. Sure enough he came over introduced himself as Ty. So nice and knowledgeable about everything Cheesecake Factory. We were hungry and ready to order. He took our order making special note of my allergy to tomato.  In no time our food arrived looking absolutely delicious. We were chewing down and Ty gave us a check to see if we were fine. He was great with his timing and not a pest. He still kept up with that huge group that looked like they were having a ball! Our dishes were removed when we were done and Ty promptly took our desert request. Again it was no time before I had my Vanilla Bean Cheesecake that I inhaled with no problem. My daughter took her Nutella Cheesecake to go.  Only two small problems. I won't take away stars because overall it was the best experience I've had at this location.  First, my daughter didn't want whipped cream to go. She got it anyway. I couldn't get a decent photo. Her slice was a mess in the container before we left. It shouldn't change the taste. I'll get a report when she eats it.  Second, every time we've been to eat at this location we have had something flying around our food. Once it was a fly. Today it was a little bug of some kind. I really wish they would fix that problem. I don't like to share my food!! Maybe N.J. doesn't have the strict rules we have in NYC. Didn't have this issue in Wayne or Hackensack though at their Cheesecake Factory.  Still Ty especially made this a great experience. Half price Cheesecake didn't hurt either.

It wasn't so much the mediocre and overly sweet cheesecake but our waiter was terrible!!! Had to wait 20 mins for water while the cheesecake and macchiato already arrived. We were over it at this point but what was annoying was that he kept circling our table, clearly not busy and not bringing back our $10 change!! He wanted a $10 tip for a $32 bill and literally doing nothing. We obviously would never return here. Not even for free.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=160

The host in the front counter had such a nasty attitude with my bf. [probably having a bad day but the sassy attitude was uncalled for] They ran out of bread and none was available until after we already asked for our check. [the bread was the main reason we went to eat here that day (craving it)] We had ordered a few entrees as take out and I should've checked them before leaving because when we got home, one of our orders had french fries instead of sweet potato fries.

Melissa B.,"Huntington Station, United States",63,1,,3.0,27/12/2015,Honestly last night was my first an last visit!! The place is beautiful but they need better seating arrangements for customers who are waiting for over an hour just to be seated. We waited outside because there was just too many people waiting to be seated. As we waited out side the restaurant too many teenagers where walking past I was wondering if I was going to have front row tickets to see a fight break out. Honestly I felt unsafe for the little girl I had with me and for my boyfriends safety because security wasn't doing there job! So after a hour and a half the buzzer finally rings we had sometime to look at the menu on our phone and knew what we wanted. I ordered  pasta Da Vinci it was awesome. My boyfriend ordered the bacon bacon burger he loved it. And the little lady had the cheese pizza for kids and that was a thumbs up in her book!!  The wait staff needs better training. We had to keep reminding the waitress to bring out our drinks more then three times and when she finally did of course we finished our sodas not a minute after we got them. And we had to keep reminding her to bring the kid size milkshake she needed to keep checking on. All in all the food was good. The wait was horrible and the waitress was below average I don't see myself visiting this Cheesecake Factory in the near future.

So while everyone was eating, one person from our party had to wait a little longer.

The wait time was about on par with any other location, about twenty minutes. Once we were seated, our server was nice but definitely very inexperienced. He had to continually go ask other employees questions that he didn't know the answer to, which while a little more time consuming, is preferable to him making up an answer or not even bothering. Overall, however, everyone was very helpful and attentive. In terms of food, I got my staples, which are the Buffalo Blasts for appetizer and the Cajun Chicken Littles for an entree.

Food ranges from burgers to pasta dishes to burritos. Had crab cakes for an appetizer which were pretty good. Then I had the 4 cheese pasta with chicken.  Had to add salt and pepper to give it some flavor otherwise it was a bit blandness My friend had the burrito supreme which lived up to its name  (12"")  which was pretty good definitely worth ordering again.  Portions were plenty full.  Didn't have room for cheesecake had to get it to go.

Also, they select who to give bread baskets to. After being seated for 15 minutes I asked when we were getting the bread basket to which he replied that they had just ran out. Then, he said that they said it was coming out of the oven and we would shortly receive it. We never got the basket btw. This place was a headache of constant waiting! Go to the one in short hills.

We ordered the smokehouse burger with sweet potato fries and I had the bow tie chicken pasta with a garlic sauce (I forgot what it's called). My bf said his burger was pretty good but wished he got more fries since all you get is about a cup full. My pasta was pretty good. It had really good flavors and  I really liked the tomatoes in it. My only thing is it had kind of a burnt aftertaste. Not sure if it was supposed to taste like that or it was the pancetta. Regardless I ate it and it was still good. Probably won't order that again though. James was great with keeping our cups full and answering any questions we had. CHEESECAKE TIME!  We ordered two kinds, the red velvet cake and the white chocolate macadamia caramel cheesecake. My boyfriend liked them both.

The menu is extremely extensive with so many options from Asian cuisine to Italian to Mexican. I almost always get the spicy chipotle chicken sandwich with a side of fries which never ever disappoints. The shrimp scampi is pretty good as well.

The service was so slow and inattentive it was a bit annoying, and I'm generally a fairly patient person.  The restaurant was pretty crowded, but they seemed to have enough staff to handle the tables, and then some, as there seemed to be servers and runners milling about all over the place.  It took about 15 minutes before our server came to take our drink order, and then another 15 before he brought the drinks and took our food order.  He forgot one of our appetizers.  Also, the food came out at different times, which should never happen at a restaurant.  When we did need something, our server often came to take orders from neighboring tables without ever looking our way.  I have worked as a server and bartender, so I know, you never come onto the floor without giving a quick glance to all of your tables to see if someone is trying to flag you down.  It is really frustrating when you are waving your arms and the server never even looks your way.  Why do I have to yell across the restaurant?  Clearly they were not that interested in seating the growing crowd of people in their lobby, because I even had to get up and go hand him my credit card personally, because I wasn't sure if he was ever going to come pick it up. The food was all very good (except the appetizer we never got...at least he remembered to take it off the check).  Hopefully this was an isolated incident and they will get their act together, because we do enjoy their food.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=120

I answered no and since we waited so long we were ready to order the whole dinner appetizers/dinner and even desert. When the appetizers came, one of them was not what was ordered so that was taken back and right one was bought to us shortly. We had to ask for bread 3 times from three different servers and finally the bread arrived. Now it was time for dinner and 3 out of the 4 dinners ordered arrived so we all waited to eat and about 20 minutes later we had to ask the server where the dinner was, she went back to check and came back later on and bought the much awaited dinner which by this time all the rest of our food was cold. The server stated that the manager would be coming to our table shortly. The manager arrived and stated he was sorry that the order was delayed !!!!!!! That was all he said !!!!!!

I understand its the holidays, but when you come by my table to let me know the food is delayed and see that my water is empty. And walk away is not the standard im used to. That was after waiting 15min to have her stop by to see how we were doing. I order some water for my son because he finished his juice.. And this waitress took another 15 min.

Ben B.,"New York, United States",0,14,,2.0,28/10/2016,"I live in the neighborhood and was looking forward to coming here. There is definitely some issues with management:  - Too many staff members not really serving anyone. There were 4 people behind the host stand, chatting and laughing with eachother... never looking me in the eye. I felt ignored.  - The waitress was nice, but seemed overworked. She was hard to find throughout the meal - One of our appetizers never came out..... by the time the entrees came we didn't want it anymore  - I ordered a burger and the bottom of the bun was soggy wet. I couldn't find the waitress and had to flag down another staff member (also asking for ketchup). I got a new bun, but the meal wasn't very good due to this. The ketchup eventually came - 10 minutes later.  - Waitstaff always seemed rushed, and asking for things like refills on drinks was hard to do because I felt I always had to chase down someone.  - I felt that becuase an appetizer never came out and the burger bun was so soggy, there would have been some sort of apology (a free apetizer, soda, dessert... something) Nothing was ever offered and because of this, I probably won't be back for sometime to come.  Overall, I give this place a subpar review (especially relative to other locations throughout the US). There were a few things that were on-par but there is a lot of work that needs to be done. I see this a management error.  Too many staff members for poor customer service. Wake up.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=180

I dined there last night and for 2 people, it was a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad for a Friday.  I overheard parties more than 2 people ranged from an hour to two.   The only reason I gave this establishment 4 out of 5 stars is because of the server we had.  It's really a crap shot when you dine at TCF.  We ordered our app of the factory nachos and it came out before we even received our drinks.  We were extremely disappointed with the service.  The server tried to push us forward with the meal but we made sure to take our time.   I ordered the crusted chicken Romano and it was delicious but if you order it, ensure to ask for the sauce on the side as they over sauced the pasta on my plate.   Also, we got the peanut butter fudge ripple cheesecake to go only to realize that they give you a smaller piece of cake when you get it to-go rather than order it at the table.   Regardless of my experience last night, this restaurant is always a great place to dine!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=180
G E.,"Jersey City, United States",0,5,,1.0,10/4/2017,"The service and management at this Cheesecake Factory located in Newport Mall, Jersey City has gone from poor to terrible. The first time I ever made an attempt to visit was shortly after they opened 2 years ago. I loved the establishment in other locations, and was always pleased with the Miso Salmon dish for nearly 16 years without a problem. I tried to pick up an order at the Newport Mall location shortly after they opened and they kept me on hold for 15-20 minutes or more (sounds unbelievable right...yeah I know, I couldn't believe it either). After all that hold time they still never took my order. I hung up the phone and opted for another restaurant   The last time I visited was last year. I ordered salmon that tasted somewhat like old fish, it was so bad I actually couldn't eat it and had to send it back (something I really hate to do). I then asked for chicken and biscuits as a substitute and they told me it was sold out.   Tonight I went back. We waited 15 minutes to be seated (with no one ahead of us) even though there were empty seats and I was told our wait would be short. Staff was nonchalant about clearing and cleaning the tables that were recently vacated by previous patrons.    I proceeded to the men's restroom once we were seated, and to my surprise there was absolutely no hand soap! I asked staff could i get some soap. After 5 minutes of waiting near the restroom for soap, I saw staff approach the manager who gave a nonchalant gesture toward my direction. Staff then gave a shameful look in my direction and went back to preparing tables. I waited another couple of minutes and approached the same staff, who then went on another search. This time the hostess went to the restroom to check. When she came out of the women's room without soap I asked her for soap. She said ok. Then the manager who wouldn't move to help me before finally comes in my direction to apologize. He blamed the lack of soap on the mall being closed at the time and said they're waiting for a shipment. I didn't believe him. Needless to say, a restaurant should always have soap in the restroom at all times, otherwise the restaurant itself should be closed.    Another 2-3 minutes later the manager comes back with soap from the kitchen. I waited for soap so long until my sister who accompanied me thought something bad possibly happened and told my son to check on me.   I ordered chicken and biscuits. The waitress was pleasant, but my chicken and mashed potatoes was lukewarm, and the biscuits were cold. I was afraid to send it back after the poor service I already received. I begrudgingly ate it with a resolve that I would never return to this establishment again.   This place is giving the Cheesecake Factory franchise a bad reputation. They really need to do something about this. If anyone wants to try Cheesecake Factory, don't go to the Newport Mall Jersey City location. Choose another location, or you might be as disappointed as I was and am now.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=180

It was about a 40 min wait as we expected since its new and on a holiday night but didn't mind. Service: The waiter...Tyquan...was extremely friendly and got down low enough so we were all face to face. He answered our questions and ordered our meal. He served us well, asked how everything was going 15 minutes after we started and the two of us were pleased. 5 stars here Meals: I ordered their Louisiana chicken, My wife got the Thai glazed salmon . The taste was great !!!  The amount of pasta they gave me was in abundance compared to other places and it was spicy! My wife loved her Salmon and the two of us could""nt  finish. The serving size is huge. 5 stars Setting inside : Dimmed lights, very cozy and unique shape. There is outside seating if you wish. I highly recommend this place if you don't mind the wait. After all, if this place was bad, there wouldn't be so many people inside. That tells you something. Cheesecake: How many varieties do you like? there are so many that you can try a different type each day and you will be done with the menu in 3-4 weeks.

Jennifer M.,"Honolulu, United States",337,2,1,1.0,15/2/2017,"I am a regular at the Cheesecake Factory in my hometown in CA, I have never had a problem... until now. My friends and I came in on 2/13 for  lunch around 2:30pm, The restaurant was quite empty. Our server came right up and was quite attentive at first. He went ahead took our order, 20+min later no food and no server in site. Our drinks were empty we had to ask other employees for refills. Finally, our waiter saw us and noticed we had no food, he was like let me go check but never made eye contact or asked if we needed anything. It took approximately 40 min for our food to arrive at our table. This is unacceptable for a restaurant that wAs not busy. The food was dropped off and again our server went missing. Each rare time he would pass by we would try just over look our table. We wanted to order dessert and once again it was a mission to locate our server. He finally came by took our dessert ordered and dropped off our check. When I took a look at my check I noticed that he Charged me for a dinner dish when I specifically told him the lunch size. When I brought it to his attention he wanted to start arguing with me saying I was wrong. He finally sorry let me get that fixed. After fixing the check our dessert took approx 15 min to arrive at our table as well as our revised check. I forgot to add that the server was also waiting the table behind us and he also messed up their order. In the end, this has been clearly the worst experience I have had at a Cheesecake Factory and I have been to many all over the country. I still love the food and hopefully this was just an off day for the server. My friend and I are previous restaurant workers and we know when we are receiving bad service and we both agreed this clearly was horrible service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=180

I definitely recommend you coming in and trying out the food and cheesecake despite the really long wait. It is definitely worth it despite what others say. You should definitely try it out and have a taste for your self!!! I recommend the steak diane and the Godiva cheesecake for sure!  P.S. Come around 2-3ish pm.

It's ridiculous how little alcohol it takes to give me a nice buzz.  Finishing a single drink is hard for me to do.  I downed a huge Caribbean style drink and didn't feel a thing, which means only one thing .... their drinks have hardly any alcohol in them.  So we finally order dinner.  I had a craving for the fish & chips.  It was so greasy I couldn't eat it.  What's worse is that when I brought it home my pets wouldn't touch it either.  It came with fries (which I normally don't eat) but since I wasn't eating that fish, I tried a couple.  They were also greasy and tasted just like fish.  It turns out they cook the fish and the fries in the same oil.  In short, it was a big waste of time and money.  I was very disappointed.

Young A.,"Jersey City, United States",0,29,5,1.0,23/4/2016,The worst phone service I've seen. Tried to make a reservation - left on hold for over 10 minutes. Finally hung up and called back. Suddenly I'm told they don't take reservations at this time and nobody remembers anything about anyone being left on hold. Ridiculous.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=220
Jason V.,"Chicago, United States",3,45,3,1.0,11/12/2015,"This place is mess, disorganized, and completely dysfunctional!!  We ordered literally 2 slices of cheesecake and its taking over 10mins waiting!!!!!this is completely unacceptable!  Better yet 8 dollars for one slice of cheesecake are you freaking kidding me?   I am NOT coming here again to pick up just one slice of freaken cheesecake!!  This place is a mess!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=220
Dan G.,"Clifton, United States",1,6,,5.0,9/12/2015,I worked at cheesecake factory for several years in college. I can say first hand from seeing the behind the scenes at several restaurants that the cheesecake factory is top quality. The restaurant has very high standards for the quality of their food and service. The food is all prepared fresh daily along with fresh fish. The sauces are prepared to order. The dressings are made from scratch. It is all delicious. My favorite thing is the variety. There are over 250 items on the menu including skinilicious items and vegatarian items. Do not be turned off by the wait- there is a reason for it. The food is great and they try their best to not send food to the table that is not up to their standards. I've personally seen a manager try a sauce for a dish and make the kitchen remake the whole thing. The manager chose to make the guest wait for a quality product and even bought them dessert after explaining why they were making them wait. Just a note... don't order brown bread or pumpernickel...it's whole wheat!,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=220
Jennifer M.,"Jersey City, United States",109,9,3,2.0,11/1/2016,I generally enjoy The Cheesecake Factory and have on occasion gone to the ones in PARAMUS and such. I am super happy to have it here in Jersey City YET the staff continues to not step up. They are nice. Yes. But inexperienced. Frequently bringing food to the wrong table. We waited over 25 minutes for cheesecake (already made) to be brought to the table. Our waitress (super nice) forgot things multiple times - after multiple reminders - like a straw. Honestly there are so so many staff and waiters / waitresses and it feels aimless and unfocused. Is it management?  Is it inexperienced servers?  All I know is I won't be coming here often.  Sorry :( I wanted to love ya.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=220
Rebecca P.,"Jersey City, United States",1,6,19,1.0,11/12/2015,"This place has the WORST service when ordering cheesecake to go!! We have people just standing there when all the orders were taken but takeout cheesecake orders were coming out! There's no proactive staff to bag the dessert and giving out to the million people waiting for their order as soon as they were boxed!!! I know it might be your job just to take orders at the register but when u don't have any orders to take, it doesn't take much to help the pack the orders and call out the names! It's not a crime to step in and help out!  Price of cheesecake is ridiculous!! 8 dollars per slice??!!! Are these made out of gold??!!! That is crazy!!! I won't come here again! Restaurant is all about the service and the service at this restaurant was -1 star!!!!  Even the people behind me was stating that it shouldn't take this long to get a slice of cheesecake when it's already pre made and pre-cut  so all they have to do is take a slice and put it in a box! I didn't realize i was asking for them to build me a rocket!  I thought this was a great addition to jersey city dining experience but I was completely fooled!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=220
Shari M.,"Jersey City, United States",9,19,24,3.0,4/12/2015,"Attended their first day opening practice/training session where management uses the time to train staff. The decor is beautiful, more modern than a few of the Cheesecake Factory's ive been to which is a plus because some look dated. The music played was nice, Selena Gomez, India Aire, Adele so it was a mix of r&b and pop with the occasional Christmas song as it is December. My server was Tey. He was handsome and kind but spoke way too low. I could hardly hear him sitting a few inches away from him. His trainer Grecia was awesome. She was kind, attentive and cheerful. It's nice to be served by someone who knows their stuff. The session included a complimentary beverage, a shared appetizer, entree and shared desert. For drinks I had a Blueberry Mojito, it wasn't to berry-y or minty. It was the perfect blend and refreshing. My mom had a glass of moscato and they're not stingy with the pour. The appetizer we chose was the fried chicken sliders, they were huge! and spicy. My entree was the fettuccini Alfredo which I didn't like. the noodles were tooo chewy and the sauce was underseasoned. My mom had the everything pizza pie which she enjoyed. it had pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach and something else i can't recall. On the the cheesecake which is always the best part. The Dulce De Leche caramel cheesecake was delicious. It's really sweet so it may be too sweet for some but it was perfect for me.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=220
Hayley K.,"Vancouver, United States",0,4,1,5.0,22/1/2016,"I was impressed with the great service and delicious food that I received here. Sherry, my server, was so nice and so knowledgable about the entire menu. She made me feel like a valued customer. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and was thoroughly pleased with my decision. I will definitely be coming back to The Cheesecake Factory. Hopefully it'll be just as good the second time around.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=220
Angelo R.,"Middletown, United States",0,20,,4.0,15/12/2015,"The food was excellent not the usual franchise run of the mill fare. Burger was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. Service was ok as our waitress must have been new. Long waits in between the bread, the meal, the dessert, and finally the check. I had my 4 year old niece with me so you can imagine those waits seemed even longer. Lol. Godiva cheesecake was heavenly!

Ebony J.,"Brooklyn, United States",9,125,7,4.0,12/3/2016,This is my first time experiencing Cheesecake Factory and I was very pleased with my food and service. I would have given 5 stars but the wait time was very long. We were told the wait time was 40 minutes but we ended up waiting for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Once we were seated we were greeted immediately and everything from there went smoothly. I enjoyed the calamari and the large portion of buffalo blast. I loved the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta. I was so full that I didn't order any dessert so I will need to do this on my next visit.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=220
Sara S.,"Union City, United States",52,60,1,3.0,14/3/2016,They need to manage the waiting area a little better. So many people everywhere it gets confusing.  Not sure why we didn't get served bread.

Joshua R.,"Manhattan, United States",40,8,6,1.0,31/10/2016,"Wish i can give a 0.... I Walked in and was at at 4:11pm i was sat/dining alone i went through the menu and decided on my full order quickly since i love cheesecake factory and at 430pm i proceeded to walk out because no one greeted or even acknowledged after the hostess sat me... its a monday afternoon on halloween the restaurant was empty and there were only 4 ppl at the bar. TERRIBLE SERVICE! OR NON EXISTANT SERVICE!! MY FIRST TIME IN THIS MALL AND IN NJ AND WHAT AN EMPRESSION!  I FREQUENT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY IN NYC, WHERE IM FROM AND EVEN THERE IN A SUPER BUSY NIGHT THEY AT LEAST SAY HELLO OR BRING WATER... what made it worst was i see servers bringing out food and serving other tables so i was patient but once i noticed staff walking paste over and over was when i walked and and of course no one even noticed. I wont blame it on me being latino since i hope in 2016 i wasnt being ignored because of that but i was the only single person there not hard to spot. Please address the issue i hope it doesnt happen to someone else... i am happily at johnny rockets eating and writing this horrible experience review at now 4:40pm and i was sat order taken and my soda and water in hand!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?start=220

Ordered kale salad, they forgot the apples and green beans that go in there. I finished my salad app before we even got our drinks, water & lemonade. Shrimp angel hair pasta, shrimp was way over cooked, tough  My dish orange chicken, mash was cold, veggies way over cooked. Oh and we had to ask for bread, even after my appetizer. Smh!!
