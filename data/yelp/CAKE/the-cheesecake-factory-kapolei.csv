Jamie S.,"Kapolei, HI",120,84,35,3.0,9/20/2017,"Braved opening day, and they were fully staffed, so many hands on deck!  Our server was working hard, but did not appear to be very experienced, so what a way to get immersed in your new job.  The food was good, we didn't order anything fancy or that Cheesecake Factory does ""well"" for our main dishes so I would not feel justified to pick it apart, but it really wasn't delicious.   Our pumpkin cheesecake was still frozen throughout 75% of it when it came out, but it still tasted good, it was just cold or frozen in some parts.  Made for interesting texture.  The congregating areas for the staff are in the only pathway for patrons to come and go so walking by with a toddler on my hip was challenging space wise.   Also, the handicap sign, in the designated parking is backwards and that really peeves me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=160

Jean D.,"Honolulu, HI",0,17,6,4.0,12/26/2017,"I feel like this place is a bad luck for me & my fiance. Visited here for the 2nd time on 12/26. We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Strips for our appetizers, Bacon-Bacon Burger and Mushroom Burger Swiss.  The chicken was okay, my fiance liked his sandwich but I didn't really enjoy my sandwich. There cheese slice was pretty thick and it had no flavor.  When our sandwiches came, our appetizer also came. Our server (dude wearing all black) also told us that the fries would come out in 2 mins. We said we didn't mind waiting, and went ahead to eat our sandwiches. By the time we finished our sandwiches, fries never came.. We told our server, which she apologized and brought it out right away.. downside to it was the fries were stale and we couldn't enjoy it.  Would we come back here for the third time? Maybe not... Maybe only for the dessert we will come back for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=160

Syn A.,"Pearl City, HI",78,125,258,3.0,10/10/2017,"There's still a fairly long wait to get seated (60 minutes at 5pm on Discover's Day). The service was decent with the biggest disappointment was waiting for our desserts. It took forever & when our waitress finally came by to find out why were still at the table when we'd already paid our tabs, she found out a cheesecake we ordered was sold out. So I'd advise that if you can wait to pay your check, do so until all your food gets served. I'm guessing this location will always be busy just like the Waikiki location, so come prepared to wait for a table. I also noticed that smaller groups of 2-4 people get seated quicker than a group of 6 or more. My sister enjoyed her Steak Diane/Chicken Madeira combo & my Chicken Costoletta was tasty.

Jaymie M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,3,,2.0,11/12/2017,"This was the 2nd time our food did not come out correctly.  Although our waitress was very helpful and apologetic and provided great service.  When we didn't receive our meals correspondingly a (female manager) came out and gave a complimentary bowl of soup, which was fine.  When the steak meal wasnt cooked as requested, it was sent to be re made.   We waited a while before deciding to just cancel the order.  The waitress was very understanding of the situation so she mentioned that she would ask to comp the 1 meal and pack it to go.   However, when her (male manager) approached the table and was asking a series of question and I mentioned that the waitress suggested that the meal could be comped and packed to go....his response was ""Well she isn't authorized to make those decisions, that's why I am here""  I was offended by his attitude and choice of uncessary comments.  I felt as a manger he should never offend a patron especially with inconsiderate and unnecessary comments. As a former food service employee, I didn't let that effect the tip of the waitress, however I felt my family's experience was tainted due to the Male managers decision to handle the situation inconsiderately. It's one thing for the kitchen to be unable to handle the volume, but it's another to be treated negatively in addition by someone in a managerial position.   I hope for the sake of future patrons and the employees, reading this post has a positive effect on the future outcomes of this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=160

So cheerful yet working very hard!  We were seated in a nice location and the space between the tables was very roomy and comfortable. Nicole was our server with DYLAN diligently assuring our awesome experience !! The service was excellent - the choice of appetizers- entrees- and yess  the desserts were SUPERRR. I FELT so VIP. The portions were plentiful and no one left hungry. I can't tell you how perfect everything was. Tasty flavorful food and again so many workers so happy to see us.

Jenny S.,"Honolulu, HI",67,25,65,5.0,10/24/2017,"We came here 2 times and I guess we got lucky both times to have amazing and quick service.  The first time was our first time since we had a $50 gift card.  We came on a Saturday at  430pm and was told the wait was about 45 mins for 2.  We were okay with it since we expected it that is why we came early and werent hungry yet.  After about 25 mins our pager went off and we got seated at a booth.  Service was quick and we got bread and our drinks.  I ordered just ice tea and the hubs had a good drink their JW lemonade which I swear is so addicting like crack lol.  He got a few of them during dinner.  It took us a moment to look at the menu since it was ridiculously huge. We ordered the appetizer of the truffle bacon grill cheese from the happy hour and it was pretty good.  The hubs ordered the fish tacos and subbed the sides with fries which the fries were so so so amazing another addicting thing.  I got the shrimp scampi it was good but not something i would order again since the shrimp was breaded and fried which i didnt care for much.  We were so full that we couldnt even get dessert but we did come back for dessert.   We came back again on a weekend day for dessert and it was busy but since the bar was open we sat there.  Again service was quick and food and drinks came out fast even tho the bartender was hella busy.  Hubs got the JW lemonade again and then he tried the flying gorrilla which is basically a spiked chocolate n banana milkshake which he said was amazing and after got the strawberry creamsicle which was a spiked strawberry milkshake.  He said they were all good. We ordered the Adams special cheesecake which has caramel, butterfinger and reeses pb cups inside the cheesecake and peanutbutter frosting on top with whip.  It was both our fave things combined into one and was amazing.  Again we ordered a side of fries since they were like crack and was surprise at how big the serving was.

Jackie M.,"Kapolei, HI",2,25,18,5.0,12/21/2017,"I've been here 3 times since they've opened and I have zero complaints. Every time we've gone it was off peak times and were seated right away. The service is always awesome and the food never disappoints. We always get the Thai Lettuce wraps, calamari and Hibachi steak. If you're looking for pasta, the Spicy Chipotle pasta is delicious and is good enough for two people. If you're feeling Thai food, the coconut lime chicken was really good too. Avoid peak times or prepare to wait. Also I've notice if you call to see how long is the wait time, they always say about 1hr-2hr wait even if there's hardly a wait. I think it's their padding for time in case it gets busy. Twice I've called and they told me that and when we came we got seated right away.

Sha R.,"Aiea, HI",0,12,4,5.0,9/19/2017,"I usually don't go to a restaurant when they first open because of past experiences at other restaurants.  When a new restaurant that can only be found either in the mainland or in town, opens on the west side , we get pretty excited and we all want to try it at the same time. So that guarantees that the restaurant will be crazy busy and what usually happens is that restaurant can't handle the crowd, provides terrible service, and closes ""temporarily."" This was NOT the case today at Cheesecake Factory.  The grand opening was today and this was by far the best experience I've had at a new restaurant.  You can tell they have a solid system and they took the time to train the staff.  It also looks like they had seasoned Cheesecake Factory workers there too to assist.  The customer service, the food, the location, everything about it did not disappoint.   If you love avocado, the avocado rolls are a must!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=160

Out of our party of 7, 4 of us got food poisoning immediately hours after having dinner. Dont eat there! This happened on December 11, and i doubt there is any change.

Rob V.,"Honolulu, HI",0,39,72,5.0,9/30/2017,"This place is awesome! My wife and I went out The Cheesecake Factory, her favorite place to eat.  Downside, Friday night wait time was between 65-80 minutes.  Luckily we live close by so had time to wait it out at home.  The front door greeters were very polite.  We waited for 80 minutes and finally a couple of seats opened up.  Downside, they put us right next to a band that was playing, soo close that I could reach out and touch the guitar being played.  Just a recommendation to not have a couples table soo close to the band.  Most couples would like to talk out on a date.  It's easy to reconfigure the layout cause the tables and chairs are mobile.  You should put a bigger party table closer to the band, but at least 5-7 feet away and not an arm length.   We had an amazing server who was very attentive (Sheralynn M.).  She observed from my body language that I was getting a little annoyed with the live band app close to my ears that she asked if we would like to move to a different location. We moved and ordered a couple of meals.  Our food didn't get to us until another 45 minutes.  Understandable since the place was packed.  I enjoyed dining here, but may think about doing so on a less busy day.

We did have to wait a while, about an hour, to be seated (although they originally told us 90 mins so we ended up waiting significantly less than predicted). But I'd read the reviews & I knew this was a new location so the wait was anticipated.  The most important thing, of course, was the food! Every dish received rave reviews.

There were a few things like pre busing and dropping off the dessert menu prior to our meals being complete. But other than that the experience was spot on. The food was very delicious. We got the sweet corn tamales, which was sweet and amazingly proportional. The bacon truffle cheese sticks were so savory and flavorful. My hubby got the bacon bacon burger, which was messy goodness.

I couldn't even finish what I had to say and he was already gone. I also asked for straws and that took a good 5-10min due to him forgetting. Everyone's food came, I ordered the Hibachi Steak and it came out cold as of it was sitting for a very good while, I still ate it because I was very hungry especially because of how long we already had to wait. Then the nice lady who brought everyone else's pasta and steak said their plates were hot so once I touched my plate I thought the same but it wasn't actually hot at all?? LOL We then wanted a cheesecake to go but he then said that the bakery was backed up which made us wait longer and also confused because he told us that it was pre-made and if it was already pre-made wouldn't it have been a real quick?

Explained that our food given away to another table who cares we just want our food. So desert time, another 30 minutes wait.

Julie A.,"Honolulu, HI",31,23,27,1.0,10/7/2017,"All I can say is that my visit at the new location sucked!!! The service was slow and the food wasn't the best. My family and I sat outside, literally took 15 mins to have water served to us. Food took about an hour to be served to us. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and gosh my bottom buns were soggy from the sauce and the burger itself didn't taste good. My boyfriend ordered chicken and biscuits. All he could say is the biscuits was the best part. Also, he supposed to have mashed potatoes but was told they ran out and it takes a while to make. But miraclaously half way through his meal, they brought out mashed  potatoes that we're undercooked. The manager spoke to us about all the mishaps, but I was already irritated and didn't want to waste my time talking about all the mistakes that happened throughout dinner. I just wanted to end my meal with cheesecake.  HOWEVER, our cheesecake took about 15 minutes to get to us, which totally killed my vibe and appetite. To end the dinner, I've waited 15 minutes to have the server give us the check for our bill. She apologized and said, ""sorry for all the mishaps"". Luckily, they took out the burger from the bill, but I felt I wasted money on food I didn't even get to enjoy. Sorry Cheesecake Factory, I know you just opened but here are some tips, work better on organizing a better system for sitting your customers, train your servers to be attentive, so they don't leave their customers wondering when their server is going to come back, and organized your food system to have it come out faster.

They corrected and gave us four cheesecakes for free for what happen.  The waitress soon came back with the bill, like we asked, she gave us someone else's bill. Second time, they charged us wrong.

Chennelle D.,"Waipahu, HI",34,3,10,1.0,11/6/2017,"This was my first ever visit to a Cheesecake Factory ever. I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while but after hearing all the mixed feelings about prices and food I finally decided to take my family for a night out and eat there. We got to the restaurant to check in at about 6:30pm and my wait was about 1 hour and 10 minutes. I couldn't get a pager because their policy was if the wait was more than 1 hr then the customer would have to come back for a pager. Since my wait was so long I left to shop and came back 1 hour later to ask how much longer the wait was. The hostess gave us a pager and said the wait would be about 15-20 minutes more. So we sat and waited for about 30 more minutes and I went back to the hostess and asked how much longer then wait was because our pager didn't buzz. They immediately sat us in a booth shortly after that at about 8:30pm. While looking through our menu our server came to the table to greet us. I first ordered drinks and food for my kids and I got a Lava Flow to start while I looked through the menu. While my cousin and I continued to look through the menu we received really hard bread and a slab of butter. The bread was sooooooo dry, hard, and cold. I was stuck between ordering a Ribeye, a Shepherds Pie, and a Chicken Piccata. I decided to get a Chicken Piccata and I had to drain all the fat and oil from my plate first before eating! I took few bites and all I could taste was the lemon...I spoke with the waiter and showed him the plates of oil I drained from my plate. He said it was from all the combined ingredients in the dish. I asked to talk to a manager. The manager came to my table and squatted next to me and waited for me to say something first. Then instead of trying to offer me a better experience he asked my what I wanted to do! He also gave my bullshit ass excuses as to how dish is supposed to be a heavy lemon and butter sauce and it probably separated while on the way to my table because it was too hot in the dining area lol. My cousin and I were like what the hell was he talking about! Then he asked me if I wanted to plate my food. I was fed up at that point. I let my server know what he said and his response was ""He said that? Interesting..."" lol. At least he understood where I was coming from. My cousin and I ordered a cheesecake for my kids and we ordered some food to go. I got my to go food plates up but when I looked at it there was some beef under cooked and and the veggies were cut up in chunks . It just looked completely unappealing. Another waiter came to our table with food my cousin ordered to go but it wasn't packed to go lol. At that point our server was fed up. We could tell by the irritated look on his face while he walked past our table after seeing they didn't pack our order to go. I paid for all the food and still tipped my server about $30 because I get bad he had to listen to all my complaints. Bottom line I'm never going there again if that the type of food and customer I'm gonna get from a manager! I'd rather go to California Pizza kitchen next door! I ate my Shepherds Pie I ordered to go later that night and there was soooooooo much fat in the food which tell me the cooks didn't bother to drain the beef before combining it with all the other ingredients in the dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=240

And you don't take reservations -so disappointing. And then for bar section seating people act like vultures to jump into the chairs those poor people sitting there can't enjoy their meal when people are swarming around them. The hostess we spoke with told us ""60 minutes wait"" .. Well 60 minutes came and went.. We went back up there since many others after us started to get seated so we were just curious what the time for us to get seated was she told us another 60 - 90 minutes EXTRA. We said oh no.. And went elsewhere.  Fast forward came for lunch today .. Thinking maybe its a lunch time thing. We were told again 60 minute wait.. We said fine and watched for bar seating at the actual bar. Finally two seats opened we sit. The bar staff were really friendly. They were slammed but they tried to make the best of the wait times.

Being a sever myself I have some patience when I see it is busy and what not but tonight I waited 45 minutes to get my alcoholic drinks, mind you we didn't even get water yet! We reminded our sever multiple times about the water at the least but it never came so we had to ask another sever in the next section for some waters which he got promptly.  Our sever recommended the Buffalo Blasts, it was alright kinda too oily for me. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo which was super delish!! Also the only reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars. I ordered the Chicken Madeira. I ordered it because it was the most popular chicken dish but it wasn't all that great. The chicken was drenched in the sauce looking like a soup. Plus there was just way too much mushrooms I couldn't even see my chicken. I was so over everything I didn't want any dessert because I didn't wanna wait another 45 minutes for that too.  Overall I would go back again and pray we don't get the same sever..

Kt D.,"Kapolei, HI",0,10,,3.0,12/26/2017,"Food is poorly prepared.  I came here once shortly after their grand opening and my favorite dish (Evelyn's pasta) was terrible. I ordered the pasta with no pine nuts. Sadly it was SO salty and the pasta- undercooked. Waited forever since they originally made it with nuts but corrected it before it got to my table, thankfully. Awful, I waited all that time for a below average dish. We couldn't wait to leave. Service was not great, but I expect that from a new crew.  Fast forward to today, we thought ok maybe they've gotten it together since first opening and our experience will be better. Ok, so this time we sat at the bar, and our bartender Sheri (I think that's her name) was lovely. She made our drinks properly and was very accommodating, as well as the gentleman behind the bar. So thumbs up to them. Food came out in a timely manner. Although, the man who came to drop off the food was very awkward, he needs more training.  My food was not good... I ordered the ""Cajun"" chicken little dish which is breaded chicken bites with corn succotash and mashed potatoes. Sheri, our bartender immediately recognized my plate was missing the sauces and called upon another employee to get me my sauces. Sheri clearly has experience in this industry, she's great. The sauces were not good though. Kinda bizarre tasting. Why is my Cajun chicken coming with a bbq and honey mustard sauce? And more importantly what is Cajun about the chicken? It didn't have any spices on the chicken or in the breading? The sauces weren't Cajun? I'm so confused. The plate was so sloppy. Huge portion of mashed potatoes and a flick of corn. It looked like someone ate half of my corn. It was so unpleasant.  This is so disappointing for a Cheesecake Factory. I expect way more and would like to see this location improve on the food. Hire more experienced employees in the kitchen. What is a restaurant with an experienced bartender but amateur cooks? I compared the taste and preparation of the food to Applebee's. And I despise Applebee's.

We ate family style so I got to taste all the dishes. WINGS: okay, standard bar fare. CHICKEN and BISCUITS: chicken was bland, unseasoned, despite the 'gravy', which was also bland. Also, biscuits were pretty bad. Nothing like a buttermilk biscuit. I've had frozen biscuits from Walmart that taste better and have a better texture.  Carrots were overcooked. There were about 10 peas (I love peas, I counted them) in the dish. Mashed potatoes perfect as always. CHICKEN COSTOLLETA: okay, supposed to be sauteed to a 'crispy brown'. Was more like a kind-of crispy tan. Again, the sauce was minimal and bland. Mashed potatoes perfect as always. LEMON-HERB ROASTED CHICKEN: got this to save up for lunch the next day because the screen above the desserts flashed a pic of this and it looked super good. Again, the chicken was bland and accompanied by an anemic amount of carrots. Mashed potatoes perfect as always. FETTUCINE ALFREDO & SHRIMP: at $22.50, it was not noteworthy enough (or at all) to ever order again.  So very little pasta for the price.  Sauce was overpoweringly creamy-very one note of richness. KIDS SPAGHETTI: standard marinara spaghetti is one of those dishes that is hard to cook poorly. The noodles were cooked but dried, as if it was left under a heating lamp, perhaps.  My daughter ate just a few bites despite the fact that she usually eats oodles of noodles. KIDS HOT FUDGE SUNDAE: good hard ice-cream. A bit overpriced at $4.95 for a kids serving. CHOCOLATE MOUSE CC: perfect, per usual. SERVICE: Excellent! Excellent! From the hostess to waiter to busser to manager. Very attentive, pleasant, and professional. With tax and tip, the meal came out to $150.  We ended up taking more than half of it home because it just wasn't onolicious enough to eat it all up.  I can think of a bunch of other restaurants where I can walk away completely satisfied and feel that the $150 was worth it. The Cheesecake Factory at Kapolei, unfortunately for me, isn't one of those places. RE: the manager post below--I'm not Kevin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=240

Stephanie C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",2,34,11,3.0,10/27/2017,"Went in on a Wednesday night around 6:30. Two people so we were sat fairly quick (20 minutes). Our server came to our table within 5-10 minutes to take our drink order and appetizer order. I ordered a hot chocolate because I was a bit cold.  My hot chocolate did not come out with my husband's tea so we asked about it and our server had said ""oh they didn't bring it out? Let me go check."" She brought it out. It was lukewarm but still good. Our appetizers came out pretty quickly but our main course took longer...way longer..an hour later, our server came out to say that they were waiting on my teriyaki chicken to get done. I didn't think it took that long for teriyaki chicken but ok.  After another 30 or so minutes our server came to check on us since we were still waiting for our main course to say, the kitchen said it is almost done. At that point we just asked if we could take it to go. Our server was friendly otherwise would have gotten less stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=240

Brittney E.,"Kapolei, HI",197,63,167,5.0,9/30/2017,There's finally another Cheesecake Factory on the island where the west side folks don't have drive all the way to Waikiki! I'm so excited that this restaurant is at Ka Makana. I came here around 6pm on a Friday night. There was a line just to put my name down. The wait was around an hour. You're give a buzzer so you're able to walk around instead of just sitting and waiting outside the restaurant. The time went by really fast since I was looking/shopping for Christmas presents.  I liked sitting outside with the live music and the view of the sunset. The staff here is really nice and seem to be on top of things. Our waiter's name was Brandon I believe and he gave great recommendations for both our main course and dessert. I really enjoyed the salmon.  The only thing is that parking maybe hard to find now since the mall is starting to get more crowded now.  I can't wait to come back and try other cheesecakes :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=40
Michael R.,"Honolulu, HI",5,116,368,4.0,10/2/2017,"If patience is a virtue, I must be a saint.  No really.   So here is the situation.  We were a large party celebrating a birthday and decided to head to the Factory.  One it's brand new to this side of the island. Two they don't take reservations.  So one plus two equals a three hour wait. Yes, mathematicians three hour wait!!! I can not blame anyone for the amount of time we waited.  We were told it would be sometime by the staff. I just believed it would be sooner then later but sadly no.  The Waikiki location is bigger and we might have gotten seated earlier but the drive would be longer.   To their credit, they did apologize for the long wait and did bring our party some bread and water.  Some places where I had to wait for extremely long time gave hot appetizers but this was a nice gesture.  Forget the fact, that I went to Five Guys for a couple of larger fries for the group.  Anyway once inside it was crazy busy.  People were still eating late at 9pm on a Wednesday.  My 5yo didn't even want to eat. He just slept in the booth because it was past his bedtime.  And because it was such a larger group, two dishes were missing and made late. Actually one dish was made late. The other one had to be changed because they ran out if the main ingredient.  The food didn't come till about 940pm.   The food was good and the service was fantastic. From the hostess to the waiting staff.  The manger seems like there was two at the time explained and apologized and in my option did everything right.  I wish I could say I paid the bill (yea right) to see how they treated the late dishes and see about free cheesecake but the head of the table stayed behind to take care of the bill while we all left to get some sleep.  I had a heavy meal.  For those who wonder, I got the Bang Bang dish. It's chicken and shrimp in a curry sauce.  I loved this dish and not because of the chicken, shrimp, or curry.  But because of the name.  It sounds so cool when you say it like Mick Foley.  Of course, the server laughed and understood.   Parking is plentiful, nice seating areas, very clean restrooms. Staff super friendly even when close to closing time.  There kitchen is fully visible for anyone to see and the lighting was nice.   TIP: be prepared to wait. The pager they hand out works in the movie theater and almost the middle of the mall. I should have caught a movie.   Overall four stars.  If they gave out some calamari or chips and salsa before I went to Five Guys it would be different.

Laurie H.,"Honolulu, HI",103,44,9,4.0,12/4/2017,"We waited a couple months after they opened the new location, to give them time to ""settle in."" Meanwhile many of my friends had eaten there and liked it. Everyone said they waited no more than 1/2 hour even at peak times. We went at 7 PM on Sunday and had to wait a full hour to be seated. We had a friend visiting from the mainland and wandered around the mall for a while, so that was fine. Our buzzer never did go off, but the hostess came outside and called our name. When we were shown to a table at 8 PM there were a lot of empty tables inside and outside. Our waitress was professional,  friendly, and attentive. 3 out of 4 of us got our food within 30 minutes and everyone enjoyed their food: a chicken sandwich on white toast with (cold) fries; the ahi special (which my friend sad was one of the best things he's ever tasted; and chicken alfredo (stingy on the chicken but still good.) But my French Country Salad was very to slow to materialize. In fact the others were done eating when, at 9 PM, I was finally served a small, sad-looking, wilted salad. I hadn't eaten since morning so I was famished. The salad was gone within minutes and I am usually a slow eater. It tasted just okay. The manager did come to our table before I could utter a word of complaint, apologized for how long it took to get the salad, and said I wouldn't be charged for the salad. They obviously do care about their customers and try to make things right. I would definitely like to go back and give this place another try, but I won't bother with the French Country Salad again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=40
Marcus B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",30,70,64,3.0,9/21/2017,"Fantastic product by this reputable brand in a prime location. I would recommend this place to all if you have an hour to wait! PROs: Excellent food selection, presentation, and very tasty. Even though this place was PACKED with at least a couple hundred customers during its opening month the large staff was busting there tail at all levels to serve each and every customer. Having enough well trained and courteous staff is an ongoing issue here on Oahu. Especially this far out from Waikiki Beach. The bar has lots of mixology specialties, a large wine selection, and a decent craft beer selection. The happy hour deals were good and during decent hours of 4-6pm. Some places that have happy hour from 2-5pm miss the point of happy hour for working people. The rest rooms were very clean. Parking can be challenging at peak times but that's to be expected at a mall in one of the most crowded parts of the island.  CONs: A knock that we had during our visit was that the margarita seemed very watered down or didn't come with the right proportion of Tequila. Maybe another knock is no WIFI. Biggest knock is food taking an hour to come out of the kitchen. I know this place is busy but WTF! An hour to wait for a table and another hour for the food is ridiculous. This wouldn't be if on the main land. Another place that operates in the 'Aloha' lifestyle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=40

So I sat and waited, amazingly it only took 45 minutes which is awesome! A few of us were there early so we sat and talked and waited for the rest. The server was awesome very helpful she obviously has handled big tables before. She took so many precautions to get WAY in front of orders and everything! Management was great! I wish I could tip the server more, but my company only allows for a certain percentage. All and all amazing experience anyone who wants to hit up Cheesecake Factory with a big group! DO IT!!

Angel H.,"Honolulu, HI",971,834,7664,5.0,9/14/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory in Kapolei has the biggest menu out of all the Cheesecake Factory locations nationwide. They offer the regular menu as well as the Hawaiian menu. They also serve the small plates and skinny menu, which the Waikiki location does not offer. They will be having happy hour Mondays-Fridays from 4pm-6pm; discounted drinks and appetizers.  The ambiance and decor is similar to all the other locations. They have inside and outside dining. The bathrooms have modern faucets. I appreciate the warm water when I stick my hands under them. Since this location is at the Ka Makana Alii, they have tons of free parking. Our server recommended the cucumber lemonade. It sounded interesting enough, so I had to try it. It was pretty good, on the tart side and refreshing. For the appetizer we went with the sweet corn tamale cakes. It was delicious. It was crispy and moist, and I could taste the corn. I could have done without all the sauce that was put on it. I ordered my favorite, miso salmon with mashed potatoes. The fish was cooked perfectly and the miso sauce was wonderful. The hubby had the turkey burger and gave it two thumbs up. The turkey burger had mushrooms blended into the patty and topped with caramelized onions. For dessert, I ordered my new favorite cheesecake which is the celebration cheesecake. It has layers of regular cake alternated with cheesecake, topped with a cream cheese frosting.  I'm loving this location. Welcome to Kapolei, Cheesecake Factory!

Nicole Y.,"Mililani, HI",416,233,702,4.0,11/21/2017,"As a fan of the Olino theatres, I wanted to grab a bite at the Cheesecake Factory.  I have heard from my Yelp friends that have dined here that the wait can be very long.  I decided to take a chance and see if I would get lucky enough to get a table.  To my dismay, there was a large crowd outside the restaurant and even more people near the hostess stand.  Discouraged, I figured we should try and grab a seat at the bar or at the high tops near the bar.  The bar area was also full and there was only one seat left at the bar.  I quickly snagged the last seat at the bar, while my mister stood to wait for another seat to open up.  We decided to have drinks and wait for a high top table to open up.  As quickly as one opened, another patron swooped in to grab it.  We decided to remain at the bar and one of the waitresses was nice and offered to bring us another chair.  After we both were seated, we ordered our meals.  I must say that their menu has many options that made deciding what to eat very hard! Luckily our bartender had many great suggestions for us! We ordered and happily enjoyed: Crab and artichole dip Firecracker salmon rolls Carne asada steak medallions All of the dishes were great choices and plentiful for sharing! For being quite busy, I must say that I was impressed with the staff and great customer service!

It almost felt like this place has been open for a while now and they take good care of their customers. Finally got our seat after almost a 2 hour wait.  Our waitress attended to us pretty quickly and took our drink order and brought us some yummy bread.  Finally placed our main order and took some time to get our food.  The only thing that I had a hard time getting use to is how dark it is in here... lol I felt like I needed to take my phone out and turn on the flashlight.   When our food came out, it was exactly what I expected... awesome!  Their menu is soo big I could eat here for a whole month and not be tired of it.  There were a couple of hiccups with our food, but overall the experience was good.  I'll be back when it kinda dies down a.

Maria S.,"Waipahu, HI",43,42,72,4.0,10/6/2017,"I have to say for a popular franchise that just opened, the service and accommodations were excellent.  Tip: tables by the bar are first come first serve, at most you can sit 4. We were a party of 19 for Saturday lunch and because they didn't take reservations when I called, they advised me to come down hours before my anticipated time to talk to a manager to accommodate such a big party at a demanding time.  I went about 10:30 am to put in our names and they said we would probably be called in at 1:30 pm, everyone has to be present to be seated. We all came at 1:30 and it was still about another 25 min wait.  Once our host saw us it was so funny how intimidated he was. We could see his coworkers cheering him on saying ""you got this you got this."" Mind you we had 6 toddlers included in our party.  Our friend felt so bad that she helped him pass out our menus. Two servers helped us and were very attentive, got our drinks and food as timely as they can.  We tried the mushroom burger, da Vinci pasta, avocado spring rolls and mango shake.  Given the fact that they just opened and busy, they did take about 44 min to get to us but the quality and presentation was excellent. I loved that mango smoothie! Surprisingly we were soo full we didn't order desserts, but you can definitely order through their take our are if you don't want to dine in. Mushroom burger was delicious, the pasta was surprisingly sweet with a white wine sauce.

The restaurant has tons of outdoor dining and is beautifully decorated like their other locations.

The hostess said most of the people waiting outside were large parties. Anyways, I am usually not a fan of franchise restaurants, as the food is often uninspired and sub-par. Not so today. Everything was fab! Drinks were a Lemon Drop and a Strawberry martini -- both taste winners. Appetizers were the corn cakes. You MUST try these -- taste the same as our favorite street vendor lady in Cabo San Lucas makes! We also had the egg roll sampler which was okay, but I likely wouldn't order it again. Main dishes were the stuffed chicken tamales (yum!) and chicken and biscuits. Wife said the chicken and biscuits tasted good, but she had never before been served with the biscuits dry and laid on top... strange. One thing that stands out not in a good way is that it seems like more than half the menu is chicken items. Unsure why, but it does limit your choices if you've been craving something else, even with such a large menu. Finally, as we all know, the cheesecake desserts never disappoint.

The grounds outside the entrance were well-kept and the staff at the front warmly invited us in. There was no wait for a table, and our server was very prompt in greeting us, telling us about the specials and getting our drink order. Menu prices were as I expected for a Cheesecake Factory AND being in Hawaii. Needless to say, it's not going to be a weekly stop. I ordered the lunch pizza and salad, which if I recall was about $14. I expected the lunch portion to be small, but my wife and I could have split it. The pizza was okay, but definitely not as good as California Pizza Kitchen. I would say it was more like a Digiorno pizza on a restaurant plate. We saved room for dessert and split a slice of cheesecake. It was excellent, but at $9 a slice it better well be.

For appetizers it was stuffed mushrooms and fried cheese. Yummy and great starters! For our main course, I couldn't decide between the honey truffle chicken and chicken Madeira. Thankfully our waiter has tasted majority of the menu and swore that the truffle chicken would not disappoint. He was telling the truth, because it was unbelievable!! The battered chicken was seasoned and fried to perfection. It was crispy and tender with every bite. I though the bed of mash potatoes were delightful as well. Gosh talk about good comfort food! The asparagus was a nice touch of greens:) The hubs devoured the meatloaf entree and said it was better than mine;):::rollingeyes::: Lastly, for dessert it was raspberry cheesecake and I literally had to psychologically prepare my mind for my stomach to make room.

The boyfriend and I came during lunch, not busy at all and therefore no wait time.  Once seated, we were quickly given water, bread and the menus. We both had a bit of difficulty in choosing what to eat because there were just so many options to choose from. We finally decided on the egg roll sampler and the truffle-bacon grilled cheese sticks for appetizers and for our entrees, the pasta da vinci and spicy meat pizza with mushrooms.  The egg roll sampler came with 4 different egg rolls: avocado, tex mex, salmon, and cuban. The sampler also came with 4 dipping sauces. The salmon egg roll I can do without. It had no taste and the sauce that came with it didn't make it taste any better. The cuban egg roll had the same problem, the meat just lacked flavor and actually went better with the dipping sauce that's suppose to be for the salmon egg roll. I've had the avocado egg roll before and loved it, but this time around it wasn't made too well. The tex mex was my favorite, it is very much like the egg roll you get at Chili's.  The truffle-bacon grilled cheese sticks are a must! I just loved how right before you take a bite you get a strong aroma of truffle oil (I, personally, can't get enough of truffle oil). The cheese sticks are perfect as is that I found myself not needing to dip it into the marinara sauce it came with, which I feel overcomes the truffle oil.  Just like the avocado egg rolls, the pasta da vinci wasn't as flavorful as I remembered it to be. A little more chicken, onions, and mushrooms could probably do the trick. I was, however, impressed by the lunch portion (although it was mostly just pasta), which in my opinion could feed two people.  The spicy meat pizza (and added mushroom by request) was tasty but an item we would not order again. More cheese could have gone a long way and maybe if it is an option, order it with a thin crust instead. No complaints on the amount of meat the pizza was topped with, however.  We end our lunch with the Tiramisu cheesecake. It did not make my top three but is worth trying at least once. I would have liked more cocoa powder and no chocolate mousse topping.  Although there were some misses here and there, we will be back. There's just so much more to try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei
Ray B.,"Mililani, HI",7,53,175,4.0,1/5/2018,"I finally got a chance to come here about a month after opening. Horror stories of long wait times turned me off on the idea of coming any sooner. Well, this place is still pretty busy but it's a big restaurant that can accommodate indoor and outdoor dining. The only other Cheesecake Factory is in Waikiki and I'm pretty sure that one is worse when it comes to wait times.  There's plenty of parking at the mall so that isn't an issue. The restaurant is nicely decorated just like every other Cheesecake Factory. Standard setup with an open kitchen and a variety of cheesecakes behind the glass.  The menu is extensive. Probably too many choices as I was given 3 different menus. The main menu, a specialty menu, and the kids menu. If you haven't been here before it could be overwhelming and may take some time before you can figure out what you want. There's a lunch special menu tucked away in the main menu that's worth checking out.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp, and chicken taquitos. I asked that my taquitos come out with the rest of the food but that never happened. I was pretty much finished with my spaghetti by the time the taquitos came out. I never even touched it. Better communication next time hopefully. The chicken and shrimp felt like it needed more balance as it was too sweet. Maybe more cilantro. I thought the kids menu was a great deal. Good sized portions with a beverage included. Not to be outdone was the cheesecakes. There's a separate menu for that too. Lol. The hazelnut cheesecake was great. Not too sweet and served with whip cream.  Overall I'm glad to have access to a popular mainland restaurant. With good service and a reasonably priced menu, I'll be back.

I ordered the Chicken Riesling, the chicken was juicy and so tender.  The white wine sauce had some bacon and cream, but the sauce was still light and super flavorful.  The pasta however was a bit undone, it was difficult to swallow but still tasted good. I also tasted the steak diane, wish I ordered that dish instead.  The steak medallions were soft and tender, and the sauce was yummy.  It was served with a generous portion of real mashed potato that I wanted to devour from my neighbors plate. The Hershey chocolate cheese cake was super rich, just a small sliver of it was satisfying.  And the red velvet, always a favorite of most people I know, it is cheesecake to savor for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei
Mika G.,"Kailua, HI",70,51,143,3.0,12/20/2017,"I have been on a diet since March. I was looking forward to my birthday dinner here last week for the better part of this entire year. The last time I went to a Cheesecake Factory was within the first few years of its Waikiki location opening. I don't know if it was sub par because that's how it is or because I hyped it up to much. Either way I think their menu is too extensive to have great quality control. Service was average. Nothing really wrong with my server other than he was a soft talker. The restaurant was already loud and I have 3 kids 6 and under with me. In the beginning he was almost annoyingly attentive but that did taper off as the dinner rush came in (we started at 5...on a Wednesday).  Ambiance- it is kept way too dim for dinner time. Usually restaurants do that to lighting to create a more intimate setting so that you spend more. The restaurant is already too loud for that so the lighting Just makes it hard to read the menu.  Food- appetizers are better than dinner. Dinner I could probably make at home. Which was disappointing to me because the descriptions of each dish make it sound really good but when it comes it is not plated nicely and tastes basic-ish.  Dessert- the only reason to actually eat here. Godiva flourless Cheesecake is always my go to. The hazelnut cheesecake was to creamy with not enough crunch as the menu indicates and my husband bombed on his choice of cookie dough cheesecake. The real winner though is the brownie sundae. 3 dense brownies, 2 scoop ice cream, and whip cream with chocolate syrup. Clearly my 4 year old made the best choice. I do want to try more cheesecakes though.  One thing that was weird was that they were many other birthdays happening around me. I know this because the staff brought a cheesecake with a candle, and everyone sang Happy Birthday. I think at least 3 other having a birthday around me. I was wearing a Lei, a Lei po'o, was reading birthday cards and opening gifts... all at my table. And my waiter told me Happy Birthday as we left. But I got no cake and candle or happy birthday sang to me.... it was just a little odd...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei
Mel B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",353,601,5767,4.0,11/30/2017,"#112 of 2017 After gorging ourselves to lunch we decided it wasn't enough certainly room for dessert.  It was busy but we weren't in a rush to go nowhere.  We decided to sit in the bar area because we felt it would easier to get a table.  About 45 minutes later, I believe, we did.  So be prepared and have plenty of patience.  We got a table in between the bar and the booths.  We appropriated extra chairs to squeeze our group around the table.  I was left standing but didn't mind at all. I can't help compare  this location to Waikiki.  This feels much better.  First, the lighting is brighter using more natural light.  Some areas are tight but there are clear paths to walk to get to certain areas.  I don't have to step  aside as much to let the staff get through.  I feel it's better to let them go first.  The large bar areas is much appreciated that offers booth and high round tables with bar stools for 4.  We managed to squeeze 7.  Coupled with the easy parking, this location, hands down is more laid back conforming to our island way of life. We were lucky to get Alicia Keys (not really) who was like a splash of hot coffee in our faces.  Can we do that again?  She is a high octane adrenalin rush of freshness bringing smiles out of all of us.  I don't need to come back just for the food. She made it easy to set our order on what decadent cheesecakes to sink our teeth into.  Tuxedo for chocolate.  A rich decadent thick chocolate.  I can eat some if this but the richness is overwhelming.  Banana Creme was accented with caramel crunch that paired well with the bananas.  Now my favorite Dulce de Leche is creamy silky smooth that pushed my delicious button hard.  Oh so good.  I think I ate most of it.  lol Great company.  Delicious cakes.

William G.,"Honolulu, HI",751,181,79,3.0,1/4/2018,"""The wait is about 1 hour!"" Ok, I've heard horror stories about the wait exceeding 2 hours. So, 1 hour? Not bad right? Wrong! When you're hangry and need food ASAP, that's the last statement you want to hear.  Due to the long wait times I decided to order and pick up. Luckily, they were open on Christmas Day because I was starving. I called and placed my order and was asked if I wanted to do curbside or walk in. I opted for curbside.  When I pulled up to curbside I was greeted by cars parked in the assigned stalls. Only one car was picking up food while the others were parked! So I found a stall and decided to walk in.  When you enter the doors you are greeted by not so friendly staff. They just fake smile and make you stand in line. The host stand is positioned horribly! If the line is long it'll literally go out the door. It blocks the counter for take out orders.  Anyways, I picked up my food and took it home to eat. I ordered an appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 cheesecake slices. My total was about $75. The portions are HUGE. The quality of the food was basic. Nothing extravagant.

There is a lot of seating inside and outside but that fills up quickly.   The service is really good and they are very attentive. Our  waitress was really funny and gave some good recommendations about the menu. I was very surprised by the waffle and chicken and poached eggs. It sounded like a very odd combination but the chicken was nicely breaded so it was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It really complimented the waffle when you added the syrup.

After being stuffed full at Sura Hawai'i II, we still found room in our stomachs to have dessert.  Ahem, isn't there some saying that goes like this ""There's always room for dessert""?  Oops, that was for Jell-O!  Anyway, since we were out at Ka Makana Ali'i, we finished our day with dessert. Our group of 7 people got a pager from TCF's host but stood in line patiently for a table to open at the bar.   The turnover at the bar is usually quicker than in the dining room so we planned on returning the pager as soon as we got a table in the bar.  Most of the bar tables seat 4 but we were seated at a high-top so we were able to grab 2 unused chairs while one person volunteered to stand.   We probably waited about 30 minutes until a table opened and we converged like vultures.   We were immediately greeted by vivacious Alicia S, who joked that we could remember her name by thinking of singer-songwriter Alicia Keys.  Wow!  Alicia's outgoing personality and cheerful smile was so genuine and comforting.  She brought us menus, water and took our beverage orders.  We told her that we were planning on ordering cheesecakes but their menu is so varied that it would take us a few more minutes.  With that in mind, Alicia asked us 3 questions concerning our flavor preferences.     - Chocolate?    - Fruit?    -Sweet/caramelly? With those questions, she helped us narrow down our cheesecake choices to Chocolate Tuxedo Cream, Fresh Banana Cream and Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecakes.    Each slice of cheesecake was dense, flavorful, silky, creamy and oh so rich!      We knew that we wouldn't be disappointed with their delicious cheesecakes but having a positive and energetic server like Alicia S made our experience worth repeating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei

When we heard that a second location was opening, we definitely wanted to check it out after the initial excitement and overcrowding had subsided a bit. After catching a movie next door, we headed over for dinner and saw that there was a pretty sizable line. Undeterred, we decided to see if any seats were available at the bar and found a nice open area at the end. They even placed cloth napkins on the countertop for us.  The bartender gave us both menus, or should I say a giant stack of menus! I am amazed that a restaurant can function with such an expansive menu. If someone can't find something that they will eat, then I have no idea what would make them happy.  After we ordered, they brought us bread to munch on while we waited. The food was brought out promptly. I ordered two of the wrap appetizers from the ""skinny"" menu and they were delicious. I loved the salmon in the fried wrap and the shrimp was fresh in the spring roll. I would order both of these again for sure.  The service was great throughout the visit. The bartenders checked on us frequently to make sure we were enjoying everything. It looks like they have ample servers to meet the huge diner demand.

This location is obviously smaller than the Waikiki location but a good thing is that it is part of Ka Makana Ali'i mall with free parking!  Being regular customers over the past few years at cheesecake in Waikiki (coming like 1-3 times a year Lol, nothing to crazy), we knew what we all wanted to order and were familiar with the menu items and it's flavors. We've all had our appetizers salads, and main entrees. One complaint and reason for the 4 star rating was the wait for the food. The restaurant wasn't quite as full or busy but the wait for the food took a bit and we were not updated on the wait time at all. Also, we had to constantly look for our waitress or someone whenever we wanted something whether it was more bread, a straw, questions, etc. I do understand it is a new staff and restaurant so I won't be to harsh but 40 minutes for food wait? Ahh. Not to sure about that. However when we did get our food, it was all so delicious!!! My mom couldn't stop talking about how perfectly cooked and tender her steak Diane was. My dad couldn't stop talking about how filling and fresh the ahi poke was (comes on wonton and salad as an appetizer dish). My grandma was impressed with all the food presentations. My boyfriend was impressed how flavorful his shrimp scampi and steak Diane combo was along with the cesear salad we both shared (excellent portion as well!). And although I ordered the Kalua Pig nachos for myself, the whole table couldn't stop picking off my plate to have some!

They are different from your typical egg roll, and I would definitely order them again, I just wish it was a little more crunchy.

First off, the flavors from my Farfalle and her Madeira was off from our usual. The Farfalle's flavors were dull and restrained, and the chicken was overcooked and tough.

My husband was looking forward to the shrimp scampi and steak Diane because the first time he ordered it, they sold out.  (The server jokingly said that we she got hired, they were told that they will never run out of food---and she continued by saying that they are always running out of something, lol) When he finally got to order it, he was utterly disappointed.  For $24, you get 3 pcs. Of U-10 shrimp in a beurre blanc sauce and 4 oz. Of steak medallions with mushrooms in what tasted like  red wine demi-glace.  Although the flavor was there, the small portion does not justify the cost.  Sadly enough, he left  starving! The many times I've been there, I have yet to taste the cheesecake!  But then again, I hardly ever get appetizers or desserts because the entrees always fill me up.    The cheesecake display is located to the right of the entrance, and if you are just looking for just dessert, you can just order it to go.  Slices of cheesecake can run you $7.50-$8.50.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=20

I don't eat meat, otherwise I wouldn't. Have minded. The server didn't see my food come to the table and said that, ""Your food isn't ready yet."" Long story short, the order kept messing up. They said I could have a complimentary cheese cake, but I was going to the movies after and I don't live in this area. The server was really nice and apologetic. I know it was not her fault. I feel that this is still a new restaurant and everyone is trying to get the flow of things. Otherwise the food was good and the wait was only an hour, for how crowded it was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=20
Celestine V.,"Honolulu, HI",492,301,1020,5.0,10/16/2017,"It feels a little ridiculous writing a 5 star review for the Cheesecake Factory, but this being the 4th or 5th one I've visited has definitely outperformed them all. The first thing that probably needs to be addressed is the wait - surprisingly quick if you're open to sit anywhere and come late enough (around 9:30pm on a Sunday), and that includes the bar, which we did in our second trip, and got us out with a to-go order in 30 minutes tops. Pretty much every Cheesecake Factory has a wait, so it's to be expected. First of all, the menu is touted to be the most extensive of all Cheesecake Factories (including Waikiki), and my waiter was so incredibly optimistic and passionate about everything, I almost had a hard time deciding. She was incredibly sweet though, and despite a busy opening season, was on top of all of her tables and never once lost her cheery demeanor.  On top of this, we only got light meals, given that we had just come from another gathering, but still left full and satisfied, and I even had leftovers in hand. We started with a Cucumber Lemonade and Raspberry Lemonade - the former has become my favorite drink, and I don't believe it was on the menu at any other locations I've seen. After that, we got Avocado Toast as an appetizer, and I must say, this dish changed my life. I feel like it's such a millennial thing to say, but I'd come back for that alone, and I would love to figure out how to make it because it's that phenomenal.  He got the Skinnylicious chicken tacos and I got a side of mac n cheese (that's 2 meals worth if you eat conscientiously), both viable options. Of course we ended off the meal with Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake for him, and I opted for Linda's Chocolate Cake (because what's life if you're not going against the grain, right?), both were delicious, and I definitely had leftovers of my cake for the next day as well. It was a great chocolate fix, not too rich, but just good enough. The check was to be expected as well, Cheesecake Factory is fairly pricey, and in Hawaii even worse, but if you find something that's good enough there, it feels worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=20
Tawny H.,"Honolulu, HI",148,103,310,5.0,10/17/2017,"My friend and I stood in line for about 15 minutes during lunch time to get a table. When we got to the front, they told us we could sit outside now or wait 30 minutes for an indoor table. We noticed the bar top was open and opted to sit there. The service was great. Our bartender was friendly and patient. I loved the gumbo and the lunch salads are HUGE. We were able to take home gumbo and salad for another meal! We will definitely be back again and will go directly to the bar the next time to avoid the lines.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=20
Ariel N.,"Kapolei, HI",180,100,547,5.0,10/27/2017,"Finally was able to try this location since it's closer to home! My friend and I had waited in line near opening time for about 15-20 minutes. The tables outside were pretty much open and this line was just to get our names down, so we understood that it was going to take some time for everyone to get settled in. But when we got to the front of the line, we were told to wait about 30 minutes for an inside table or go straight outside (we, of course, didn't want to sit in the hot). So we decided upon the open bar! -- Best idea ever! There was no wait and got served immediately by our bar hostess! Service was A+! Although I didn't get our waitress'/bartender's name, she certainly made our day! Always re-filling our bottomless plantation iced tea and making sure we had what we needed. She was also more than happy to split of bill and give us to-go cups for our drinks! I ordered the seafood gumbo which is my go-to favorite dish. Right amount of spicy heat, white rice, and lots of seafood and sausage. My friends and I also shared the Chinese chicken salad which has become my go-to salad dish! It had crunch won-tons and noodles on top!  Can't wait to to be come here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=20
Tami M.,"Honolulu, HI",152,159,679,5.0,10/10/2017,"First of all, I was expecting this visit to be a bit chaotic since they've been open for less than a month. We pulled in the parking lot to find a line wrapped around the building. We decide to give it a try anyway. The doors open at 1130 and people began being seated. I'd say the worst part about the line was having to listen to the people behind me constantly complain about the heat and the long line. A mere 30 minutes after getting in line, we were comfortably seated at our table. Not a bad wait at all! Our server was super attentive and friendly. She immediately brought bread and water to our table. She kept our water and soft drinks full and checked on us often. She definitely made my first impression of the restaurant a positive one.  Now for the food! We ordered the spicy ahi Tempura Roll and calamari to start. The portions were very generous and both really tasty. For entrees, I ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. It was delish!! The shrimp were lightly bartered and cooked perfectly!! My friends got a Loco Moco and fish and chips. I didn't get a taste of their entrees but I didn't here any complaints so I'm sure they enjoyed it.  Of course I can't come to the Cheesecake Factory without eating CHEESECAKE! I got the Resess peanut butter cheesecake and the slice was ENORMOUS! It was layers of chocolate cake, cheesecake and creamy peanut butter goodness. I was in cheesecake heaven!  Im surprised at how great the service was and how fast our food came out even though we all basically sat at the same time! Excellent organization and training! I'll definitely be back to this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=20
Robyn F.,"Honolulu, HI",4,44,113,3.0,10/30/2017,"My beloved Cheesecake Factory. We frequent the restaurant at least 3-4 times a month (that's about once a week) and every time, there has been some sort of mistake or issue. We let it slide the first few times because it's new but it seems as if they would have gotten a lot better since the Grand Opening.  We went on Sunday afternoon and the wake was about 50mins. We were happy when our table was ready in about 40mins. After being seated we were served cold hard bread. It was literally rock hard to the point that it just crumbled in to crispy crumbs all over our table when we tried to break it in half. We requested for warm bread to be brought out and of course the bread came after our appetizer.  My husband and I have ordering down to a science to get our meal in a timely fashion. As soon as we sit down and are greeted by our waitress, we place our drink AND appetizer order. That way it's already cooking and being prepped when the waitress comes back to take our entree order. When the waitress comes back with our drinks we go ahead and order our entree and our dessert to go. Lastly, when our entree/dessert comes out we ask for our check before we even start eating. It's a little aggressive but ordering this way ensures that our meal doesn't take forever and a day to arrive and we're not eating idly for our food/check/dessert. We learned the hard way our first time when our meal (from being seated to waking out the door) took over 2.5 hours for just 2 people.  Food: Buffalo blasts and the Bellagio Pasta-5stars everything was hot and fresh Cheesecake: Adams Cheesecake 3stars. This by far is my favorite cheesecake but the portion size was so small compared to what I'm used to? Not sure if I got a slimy slice or what but the manager made me feel as if I was crazy when I told her that the portion size seemed smaller than usual.  Overall they are getting better. We always love the food but we've never had an experience where everything was great from the bread to dessert or from service/speed/accuracy. Of course we'll be back though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=20
Janelle N.,"Ewa Beach, HI",97,113,567,4.0,10/28/2017,"If you want to avoid the wait time just order takeout over the phone and pick it up by the front cheesecake counter. I've heard stories of friends waiting 4 hours overall for a table and food although it was a few weeks after opening. It was basically 2 hour wait for a table, 1 hour for food and 1 for dessert/check. Currently they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait especially if you have a larger party. Going later in the evening might decrease the wait time as they are open until midnight. Closer to ten, it took about 15-20 min for a party of 2. The overall look of the restaurant has a Las Vegas hotel feel to me. The pillars remind me of ceasars palace and the other interior of the Paris. We got seated in one of the two seated booths. The menu is hugeeee. There are so many options so good luck trying to pick an item. We decided to share to appetizers which were the skinnylicious salmon rolls and truffle bacon cheese sticks.  Skinnylicious? Is that even a word? It was posted throughout the menu and honestly made the items seem less appealing. I was confused how the salmon rolls were in that category as they were in a deep fried wrapper. The truffle bacon cheese sticks were essentially grilled cheese sticks coated with truffle oil and marinara sauce on the side. The tastes wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't unique or worth the price. The marinara also greatly overpowered the cheese sticks itself. The salmon rolls on the other hand were great. It was essentially salmon and spinach deep fried in a lumpia wrapper with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Onto dessert, we got the tuxedo cream cheesecake and Oreo cream cheesecake. The Oreo one was super good! The Oreo one trumped the tuxedo one by far. The tuxedo cheesecake had a chocolate cheesecake with a vanilla mousse while the Oreo one had a chocolate cheesecake with oreo mousse and tons of Oreo cookie bits. The whipped cream itself on the cheesecakes were a bit excessive but they do make pics look more appetizing. I will probably be back to try more cheesecake flavors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=20
Chris K.,"Waipahu, HI",365,60,47,2.0,12/17/2017,"This was a really horrible experience. Got there at around 5:20 pm on a Saturday, parking lot was really crowded and they had a 40 minute wait. Both are expected as it is holiday season so no biggie. They were actually really on time with their estimate and got the buzz around 6:10. Sat down, ordered...then proceeded to wait 50 minutes for our food. That is so unacceptable!!!  I ordered the chicken club with avacado and their bread was so greasy with butter it made it hard to eat. The chicken was so thick along with the tomatoes and spry letteuce that made it difficult to enjoy. Everything was falling out everywhere, I didn't even finish it was so unappetizing. Their bread is really good...that is the only nice thing I can say. Well their ceasar salad was good too but it was served in this bowl that was very rounded everywhere so when ever you tried to pierce some greens it went all off to the sides and spilled out of the bowl.  Our server didn't even come to ask how the food was. I had a 7:45 movie showing so we asked for the check right after our food and left after we finished.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=20
Cat B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",227,108,483,4.0,10/27/2017,"Walk right in and seated immediately at 12:15pm on a Wednesday!! Imagine that?!?! LOL!  And a window seat no less! The hostess said that the opening rush definitely calmed down a little, but they are still super busy after 4pm.  Drink: Georgia Peach- was the cutest little thing. Well, little as in short and stout that packs a punch! So pretty and sooooooo goooood!! LOVED IT! Sweet Corn tamales- always great. Though not quiet as dense as I've had in the San Diego location. Ya'll figure that one out! Haha ;) Calamari- always great! Light, crispy, good Shrimp Scampi- sooo my husband was kinda mad and felt like they shorted him on the pasta. There was ample shrimp, but ill have to agree that the amount of pasta was not enough to have with the amount of shrimp. Its kinda funny though, most places will fill the entree with pasta and have just a few shrimp. It was the opposite here. Another thing, the shrimp itself, seemed fried with a very light batter with lots of spices. Love it or hate it, I didn't love it.  Shepherd's Pie- It was tasty, but very very oily. I even took a napkin to it to absorb the oil, but the oil kept coming. I ended up asking the server to take it back. She kindly did so and asked if I wanted them to remake it, but not as oily. I declined and asked for Shrimp with Angel Hair.  Shrimp with Angel Hair- not good. The shrimp looked like it was drenched in black pepper seasoning. And now the pasta was too dry as if they put no oil on it. LOL! Too oily or no oil at all.  I didn't take it back, but wrapped it up for my teenager who eats anything!  Carrot Cake with coffee- So underrated as people gawk over the array of cheesecake, but thier carrot cake is always my first love. Pair with coffee, it's the perfect ending to a lunch date!  I typically don't prefer big conglomerates, but when I do go to one, CF is definitely one that I frequent. I have been coming to CF for many years and in all different cities like in New Jersey, San Diego and Hawaii. I have come to learn over the years that they have the best drinks and appetizers- never fails. That said, I have yet to find a main entree that I like. Today's visit, being no exception.  All in all, even with the 2 entrees that bombed today, I'm still rating them 4 stars. The service was super friendly, professional, and accommodating without judgement!

My go to, is the Jamaican peppers shrimp. It comes with black beans with your choice of white or brown rice. A mango salsa and sweet plantains.    Our wait was about 45 minutes, which is kind of normal for cheesecake factories. You can sit at the bar if there's available seating, it's first come first serve.  The service was excellent, our food was fast. And I am happy that there is the cheesecake factory close by. My husband and I are cheesecake lovers. We tried the macadamia nut cheesecake, which is my favorite and then we tried the chocolate peanut butter.  Another one of my favorites is the red velvet cake.

We didn't really complain though as it was aspected. The service was great! Our waitress was very friendly and always checked on us. I always get the same dish, their Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, and its never a disappointment. It's literally my favorite. I also tried their Red Sangria for the first time and it was delicious! Easily could've drank 3-4 of those. We also tried their Oreo and salted caramel cheesecakes for dessert. The Oreo is very rich and not extremely as sweet as expected.

My husband and I came five minutes before they opened today and there was a line but it moved fairly quickly and we got seated within ten minutes. When we left the restaurant an hour later, there was still a line at the front door and the restaurant looked very busy.  The menu is vast, with our waiter telling us there's over 250 items inclusive to the drinks and cheesecake. I settled with the grilled chicken w/ avocado club sandwich and my husband got the carne asada medallions. The food is great quality for a chain restaurant, in my opinion, way better than Ruby Tuesdays or Applebees. On Saturday and Sundays there's a brunch menu, something I want to try next time I come back. I was so full we took cheesecake to go.  Service was impeccable and friendly, from the hostess to the wait staff. My hubby enjoyed the service so much he left a twenty five percent tip.

Hostess informed me 15 minute wait but actually got seated in 7 minutes. Water and bread came shortly after. The server was very knowledgeable as she informed me of menu options. I ordered and as I waited for my dinner any server walking by asked if I was doing okay or needed anything. Water continuously came and I was amazed at how attentive the severs were. My food came out in about 20 mins and it was plentiful and awesome. I could not finish it all and ended up boxing the rest for later.  I ordered the Celebration Cheesecake that took a little longer to get about 25 minutes due to the many in dining and to go dessert orders. I ordered 3 dessert items to go and was surprised to get it when my leftover cheesecake was packed. I honestly didn't expect to get in at all since it was their opening day but I was blessed!

How ridiculous and unsanitary, and a restaurant? Seriously, just how dirty are the towels that are used repeatedly to wipe dirty tables?  Second- my wife and I both ordered burgers, hers well, mine medium well. What we were served, hers medium to medium rare, mine medium, but neither close to done. We were starving so we just ate anyway and hoped for the best. The taste was ok, nothing great.  Third- an empty glass is a pet peeve of mine, a sure way to deduct from a tip and our server left us thirsty. Finally- to top it all off, when the server returned with the receipt to sign something was missing.......my debit card. She left my freaking bank card somewhere and hurried on.

Keeping in mind I had just gotten off a 13hr shift and barely had a break for lunch. I joined my family that had gotten there ahead of me so when I got there I wouldn't have to wait. They had already ordered appetizers,  but waited for me to order the entrees. We put in our orders. One by one everyone else's food arrives. Except mine! The waitress checked on us when the food arrived. The next time she checked on us they were halfway done with their food and mine still hadn't arrived. So we inquire.. She goes to find out and comes back profusely apologizing that it wasn't made and asked if I still want it. No, I came here to starve and watch my family eat. Yes, I want it! She offered me a soup for my wait which I declined as my entree was gumbo. I don't want to fill on another soup. I want my gumbo! At this time we also told her we were there to celebrate our son's birthday. She said ""ok."" So the gumbo comes out after my kids have finished eating and moved onto dessert. My gumbo was really good. Flavorful with the right amount of spice. The calamari we had for appetizer got inhaled by my boys it was so good. The kid's grilled cheese is also quite good. Probably the best grilled cheese on a kids menu. The chinese chicken salad was  good. My oldest had some kind of burrito supreme. It was huge. He said he really liked it. My middle one had the shrimp with angel hair pasta, he didnt realize it would have so much fresh tomatoes in it so he didn't really care for it. He traded his father his chicken alfredo. The sauce for the alfredo was runny, but the flavor was good.  The cheesecakes we got were the strawberry and I took my vanilla bean cheesecake to go so my family didn't have to further wait for me. The cheesecake as always was on point. Airy and sooo yummy. It was the first time I had the vanilla bean, but I think I found another favorite. If you like vanilla ice cream, you will love the vanilla bean cheesecake.  Back to the service.. after failing to get me my food with everyone else's and completely forgetting we told her we were celebrating a birthday she brings us the check. There is no comp for anything for the inconvenience/sub par service. No comped dessert or singing for the birthday boy. I have to say I left quite annoyed. I only ate a few bites of my meal there bc my family was already done and waiting for me.  Will I come back? For cheesecake, most definitely. But as for dining in.. maybe take out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=80
Keo K.,"Honolulu, HI",62,151,398,5.0,9/28/2017,"FIRST TIME EVER AT CHEESECAKE FACTORY PARKING &a LOCATION: Cheesecake Factory Kapolei is in the Ka Makana Alii Mall in its own free standing building separate from the main mall but very close. They do have extensive parking for Cheesecake Factory that is lot style and is shared with all patrons of Ka Makana Alii. Stalls are fairly big not Costco size big, but bigger than most mall stalls which are super tiny. We lucked out and got a parking stall right near the outside dining. HOSTESS & GREETERS: When you enter their is an obvious sign in desk with two hostesses or greeters with genuine smiles who are informative and sincere. Despite the mayhem of a dinner rush with a huge crowd they seemed to handle it with so much ease as if there wasn't a gang of people and it being super busy they didn't make me feel rushed or stressed at all. A+ for that quality, because if I was in a busy environment I'd definitely loose my cool  We arrived 6:05pm on a Wednesday night so we fully expected to wait. She informed us for a party of 5 wait would be 75-90 minutes for inside dining and 60 minutes for outside. There wasn't much of a breeze outside so we opted for the inside. Right on the money with the wait was actually 77 minutes exactly because we were seated at 7:22pm. Yes I know who actually remembers stuff like that lol I'm meticulous like that. I didn't remember the initial hostess name who took my name and informed me of the wait time but she was brilliant young tan long hair skinny gorg! Tyra was the hostess who ushered us to our beautiful corner booth, she was awesome informative helpful and gave us amazing customer service because she removed the plates and utensils near our nosy toddler baby girl before we noticed! A+++ for her!!  WAITER STAFF: our waitress was sanoe b she was amazing and offered us outstanding customer service throughout our entire meal. They didn't make my original order correct but sanoe sincerely apologized and immediately got it fixed within 3 minutes! That's amazing team work and truly unheard of! Best customer service experience ever seriously! I take pictures of all my food and drinks so that's how I know all these time frames to the minute. We ordered our food at 740 got our drinks at 750 food at 810, so it literally took 10 minutes for our drinks and half hour for our food which is speedy for me being that there was 150+ people in attendance on a busy evening dinner rush. Their was another gentlemen tall slender white who was overseeing everything same uniform as the waiters, he was spectacular! He was overseeing every table making the napkins were under drinks, refills and tables were attended to. He's a great addition to an amazing staff because it's the little things that he noticed that will surely keep customers loyal and coming back constantly!!  FOOD & DRINKS: I had a rough week at work and don't typically drink but had to try the blue Hawaiian. It was the perfect amount of sweet and kick that I needed for my hump day, I will DEFINITELY order it again. I'm not a fan of coconut but I could barely taste it!! Yummmmers for sure. The bread that they bring out is awesome two options and the butter is delicious with a hint of sweetness to it. My husband ordered the Oreo milkshake and omg it was huuuuuuge and Oreo. I make him milkshakes at home and he's a fan of chocolate ice cream with Oreos inside so I know they use a LOT of Oreos because I use a full row from the bag and mines aren't half as oreo eeey as his milkshake. It's large and beautiful!! Tastes like they use the whole bag DELICIOUS! The ribeye steak was delicious so tender and tasty that my husband didn't even have a steak knife he only had a butter knife but honey that steak was so tender so yummy he could've just used his fork!!! My husband said, ""IM NOT A YELPER BUT I JUST MIGHT CREATE AN ACCOUNT TO RECOMMEND THE STEAK."" We are avid steak lovers (peep the meat badge) and I tried the steak and I too was moaning in my seat. I ordered the bacon burger which was very juicy moist delectable with all the bacon. Fries were sheer perfection crunchy soft and just the right amount of starch. We ordered some cheesecakes for my parents and they absolutely loved it.  I've tried cheesecakes before and it always tasted bland or not sweet enough but lawdddd this place makes me change my mind about cheesecakes forever!  We don't eat cheesecake, we NEVER order it at any restaurant but the service and the first time trying it tonite I'm now a full blown fan of cheesecake!!

We sat outside as per request to sit anywhere  The waitress we had was very nice and helpful! Now we waited longer than expected for our food but thank god they had a great manager who let us know what was happening and both me and my husband got a free cheesecake for being patient ! The food was of course worth the wait ! My husband got Huevos Rancheros and I got the fried chicken and waffles with Benedict eggs.  I also got a drink called Lava Flow !  Must try if you like piña coladas!! Only difference I believe is the strawberries mixed in.  Both plates we loved ! My husbands take on the huevos rancheros even tho a different style it was great!  As for me loved my chicken and waffles !  Hopefully you guys have better luck on not waiting as long ! And I must say for being new definitely on top of their game !!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=80
Emy R.,"Kapolei, HI",1126,91,1401,5.0,9/22/2017,"So my crazy dad wanted to check out The Cheesecake Factory on opening night. My mom is in Japan so guess who had to be his date? In fact my dad called me a week before they opened and told me I was going with him. I dragged my nephew with us, lol. When we got there, we were told the wait would be 75 - 90 mins. I thought for sure my dad would not want to wait that long but he did so we waited. 2 hours later we were seated. Dads ugh!!!!  The wait was so worth it. It was such a crazy busy night for them but the waitress and the waiter who took care of our table were so attentive and friendly. I have to give a shout out to the waiter who was from CF Boston. He was there to train the new staff. I regret not getting his name. He knew the menu inside and out. He gave us suggestions which were spot on. He regularly checked on us despite having a full restaurant. Loved him!  For appetizers we ordered the Buffalo Blast and Nachos. Omgee, the Buffalo Blast is super delish! It's like shredded boneless buffalo wings deep fried. Highly recommend this dish. The nachos were equally as good. Portions are huge by the way. For my main, I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon. This was really good with a lemon sauce on it. The presentation looked like a spider, kinda creepy but it was delish. I was so full on appetizers that I had to take mine home. Portions for the main are big too. My nephew ordered the Bacon Bacon Burger and anything that has double bacon on it you know is going to be good. The burger was season perfectly and it was very good. If you're a burger lover, order this and you won't be disappointed. So my dad, is stubborn and impatient. He would never wait 2 hours to go to a restaurant. In fact he would probably have a tantrum if it was anywhere else. During our 2 hour wait, we were trying to talk him into going to CPK, promising him that we'll bring him to CF another time. He wasn't having it. So what does the man order after a 2 hour wait? PIZZA!! The irony wasn't lost on me or my nephew lol. He ordered the Everything Pizza and loved it.  For dessert I had the Reese's Cheesecake which tasted just like a Reese's Buttercup - I had asked the waiter to surprise me since I couldn't make a decision. After a few questions from him, he brought me this. Super yum. My dad ordered the Coffee Cheesecake and said it was really good. I didn't try his since I was too busy stuffing my face with mine.  I will definitely be back. Kudos to CF on their opening night for keeping the food and service to a high standard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=80
Erica M.,"Kapolei, HI",239,6,,4.0,1/6/2018,"For a new restaurant in this area they seemed to do a good job getting it up and running with decent service. I have only been once so far. But I love Cheesecake Factory restaurants, I always get the bang bang chicken and shrimp. Ive had it in Cali, Vegas, Nashville, and now here. Every location tasted just as good. Thats why I love Cheesecake Factory. The food is consistently good, and my favorite dish, is my favorite dish no matter where I am. I'm only giving 4 stars because I have not been there and sat at an actual table, and the service at the bar was a bit inattentive at first. It's a new restaurant, only can get better from here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=80
R K.,"Kapolei, HI",0,76,106,5.0,10/2/2017,"Came on Sunday.  There were people milling around waiting to open at 10 but silly no one wanted to start a line.  Had about 15 minutes until they opened.  We went right up front and stood behind an elderly couple... then everyone came and began to line up.  Got seated immediately.  Surprised of how well they handled large groups.  One set of 20 and another with 17 people.  That's some big groups. Service was great and so was the food. Wife had the low carb Cheesecake as her lunch, I split with my son the factory nachos, bacon bacon cheeseburger and Their lunch chicken Romano.  Definitely would get them again but their menu is so big it'll be awhile!  Quality of the food and service is outstanding.  Plan to return again during the holidays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=80

We showed up early to reserve a large table and ended up waiting about 2 hours as everyone has to be present to be seated. Lucky for us, it was the exact time for happy hour(4-6pm)! I swear they keep adding more and more items to their menu. Not sure how they do it but everything I have tried is fantastic! Once we were all seated, we ended up outside which was great because there was also live music. Made our experience that much better. Service was great and we were definitely taken care of!

Gabriel T.,"Aiea, HI",458,995,1262,5.0,9/26/2017,"One of my girlfriend's most favorite places to eat is finally in an area most convenient to us more local people on the West O'ahu side of the island, specifically in Kapolei at the new Ka Makana Ali'i shopping center.  Since I frequent Ka Makana Ali'i often, I have seen the Cheesecake Factory site being built upon ever since and they set it up pretty quickly.  In regards to location, you cannot really miss it really.  As soon as you enter the front entrance side of the mall, it is pretty much right there right across from the movies and California Pizza Kitchen.  Along with the new Cheesecake Factory restaurant, comes along a few more parking stalls surrounding the new restaurant.  It is safe to say that I think this restaurant in itself will probably make up for about 20 percent of the mall's drive I would say.   I came here on a Monday noon for lunch with Jollibae and there was a line full of people waiting to be seated.  It was about a half an hour wait which was not so bad compared to their famous hour to two hour waits.  The exterior and interior design of the restaurant is pretty much on point.  All the color themes and designs and everything is really nice.  They have a menu in front of the restaurant's entrance next to the doors if you want to quickly see a portion of their menu.  I am fascinated by their high ceilings.  Anyways, they have a bar near the entrance in which they have happy hour from Monday to Friday from 4pm-6pm.  Alongside with it, you get special rates on appetizers and pupus, all ranging from about 6-10 dollars.  They have an outside and of course inside area.  It's pretty cool how you get to see the kitchen area with their tall and wide window haha.   The staff were really courteous and nice.  We got seated in the inside and was served by our excellent waitress Cheyenne, she was really good and helped us out with questions and stuff.  Another waiter, Andrew, also commented our food selections and made recommendations of his own which was randomly surprisingly nice of him to do.  Anyways, for food, they give you free bread which is da bomb bread, especially the one with the darker bread with the oats.  I wonder where they get that bread.  We didn't get the appetizers but we did get the Chicken Marinara ($19.99) and I get the Skinnylicious chicken pasta ($14.95) from the Skinny low calorie menu (under 590 calories) which was really good.  The first few bites (which they will ask you) was very good and it just got better as we eat our food along the way.  Therefore, our food at the time was excellent.  It was pretty filling.  Cheyenne, checked on us many times with good service.  When it came down to dessert, I wanted to get a blueberry cheesecake (which is my favorite) but Cheyenne suggested the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake which would be a possible alternative (since they do not have blueberry cheesecakes) and it was just lovely! So for you blueberry cheesecake lovers, get the raspberry one! You won't regret it! The cheesecakes range from 7 to 9 dollars depending on which flavors.  They have about 37 cheesecake flavors.  Overall, despite the wait, it totally makes up for it with excellent food and service at the new Cheesecake Factory.  We spent about an hour and a half at the restaurant so it made the wait seem like it was not so bad.  Looking forward to coming again more times!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=80
Frank I.,"Honolulu, HI",73,3,20,5.0,10/6/2017,"Finally, A Hawaii Cheesecake Factory with Free Parking!!! Last time I've dined at Cheesecake was years ago in Waikiki. Wanted to check this new location since it opened recently. As my first sentence mentions, the Kapolei location has ample parking since it's at the Ka Makana Ali'i Shopping Center (Kapolei Mall), which is one less thing to worry about, especially in Hawaii. I went during lunch time for an office function. Since this place has opened last month, there's still a line outside to get in (then again, every time I passed by the Waikiki location, there's a line so maybe that's a Cheesecake thing). They don't take reservations but they were able to accommodate our party of 19. Someone at the office went ahead & arrived at 11:30am to make sure they can accommodate us. I arrived at 12:00pm, we were seated at the outside lanai around 12:15pm when everyone in our party arrived. Wasn't able to dine inside, but the inside had that familiar Cheesecake tan/orange hue, complete with a full bar & a separate counter where you can order cheesecake which they are famously known for. Maybe next time I'll get to have that inside dining experience. Looking at the menu I noticed that they also have Hawaiian local entrees to cater to us locals, which I'm sure we appreciate. I included pictures of everyone else's dishes just to give you an idea of the variety of entrees you can choose from. It's been a while since I had a burger, so I ordered the Bacon-bacon cheeseburger. I was pleasantly surprised that it also came with 2-slices of pork belly on top of the generous amount of bacon. That pork belly elevated the flavor profile of the burger. In other words: it was really good! We had 2 waitresses & they did a fantastic job in attending to our needs, always refilling our drinks & checking on us to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. & of course, a visit to the Cheesecake factory isn't complete without cheesecake. I ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake to go. Overall, I had a great dining experience at this Cheesecake location. I highly recommend it, & I'm sure I'll be there again in the near future (to try out a new cheesecake flavor at least).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=80

Christie S.,"Kapolei, HI",72,210,245,4.0,9/26/2017,"I loved The Cheesecake Factory in the mainland and frequented the Macy's Union Square restaurant in San Francisco and the Palo Alto one by Stanford University, so I was thrilled to see one open up at Ka Makana Ali'i!  Had the honor of being one of the lucky guests who got to attend the Pre-Grand Opening training with my friend who works at Au Lani.  The decor was reminiscent of The Cheesecake Factory restaurants in Union Square San Francisco and Palo Alto near Stanford University campus.  There was a pre-fix menu for the Pre-Grand Openings so I ordered my favorites: -Avocado Rolls -Burger and fries  -Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake The Ka Makana Ali'i restaurant had the same menu as the ones in the mainland including my favorite Skinny / low fat menu, and the White Chocolate raspberry & macadamia nut cheesecakes.  There are also items on the menu exclusive to the Ka Makana Ali'i Cheesecake Factory menu that you can't find anywhere else.  Service was a bit splotchy and the waitress and waiter mixed up a few orders, but that's OK - it was still their pre-grand opening training and they were refining their restaurant flow. Because this is a brand new spot in West Oahu, expect long lines. Your best bet is to come before 6 pm.  It's a great place to bring your family, have a work lunch / dinner for West Oahu workers, or to hang out with friends. It's also a great place for pre/post movie date nights. Can't wait to make The Cheesecake Factory at Ka Makana Ali'i my regular dining spot when I am craving yummy cheesecake or their Skinny menu options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=80
Aimee H.,"Aiea, HI",503,280,3304,4.0,11/22/2017,"I came to this Kapolei location to meet a friend for lunch. We didn't have reservations and they were pretty full. We got there at 12:30 on a weekday and if we wanted a seat inside ,it would be a 15 minute wait. Luckily there were immediate seating available outside so we opted for outside seating! Our server sat us down and brought us some complimentary bread and butter. She took our drink orders and let us look over the menu. I had a pina colada ( sub vodka for rum, also known as a chichi), my friend had an ultimate margarita, and her mom had a tropical breeze!!! Every single one of these drinks were delicious!!! So delicious we had 2 each lol. As we looked over the menu, we decided on steak Dianne with shrimp scampi!! Yes, all three of us ordered the same dish!! I ordered my steak medium rare and it was cooked perfect! Meat was tender and sauce was delicious! The shrimp scampi came with large shrimp ( looked like 16-20 size)!! They were bigger than I expected which was a pleasant surprise!!! I like be it when you bite into a piece of shrimp and you can actually taste the shrimp, not just the batter or a tease of shrimp!! The scampi sauce that came with this was a little different but I'm a good way! It was sooo good!!! It came with mashed potatoes which was delicious as well. Since this was my first time, not just at this location, but to any Cheesecake Factory, I must say.... I was very pleased!!! Parking- plentiful Food- delicious Drinks- delicious Service- great and I left full and very satisfied!!! What more could you ask for!!! I'm definitely coming back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=80

Visit: Friday Sept.15,2017  Time: 11:30 Decor/Design: The architecture inside and outside is very unique for the West side of oahu. We got seated on a table inside by the windows facing the mountains. The seats that we were sitting in was comfortable and mind you six Polynesian were on this table and we felt comfortable. It had a really nice color and vibe In the restaurant. Bathrooms are really nice as well, and the music was just at the right volume. (By the way that playlist was awesome lol) Service: (It was getting busy when we got in) Our Hostest Tyra was really nice excited to see us. That made us feel very excited to be there (Your really need that kind of people up front being nice and excited about what they do.) When we got to our seats we were immediately greeted by our Waitress Jacqueline. She explained the menu and the drinks that they had. We ordered our drinks and 1 minute later she's back with the drinks. Our appetizer came our 5 minutes later and they were really attentive to when we finished it. Once they seen our plate was empty our entree's came right after. It got really busy in the dining room but Jacqueline always made sure that our drinks were full and we were okay.  Staff: Really young, Vibrant, and Excited!! They were all really good. Food: The appitizer was the Ahi Carpaccio and it was delicious. Think of a Flat Ahi poke with sauce and vegetables.  For my entree I had the Honey Truffle chicken with Mashed potatoes and asparagus which I highly recommend, The chicken was very moist and well season and the mashed potatoes were sweet and creamy. I also liked the pasta that my friend ordered, the sauce was just right for the pasta. The steak that my Other friend had was really good. Like melt in your mouth good.  For dessert we had three cheesecakes, the red velvet cheesecake, the celebration cheesecake, and the Smores cheesecake. All of them were good. But out of the three, the red velvet cheesecake was my favorite nice and creamy.  Overall: I loved my experience at the cheesecake factory. It was my first time ever going to one. And certainly will not be my last. Finally we are getting a good restaurant on our side of the island.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=80

Brad B.,"Wahiawa, HI",5,64,27,2.0,9/26/2017,"Went opening night for what we hoped would be a nice dinner out but knew that most likely it would be a dessert to go kind of visit. We arrive at roughly 4:30pm, stand in line to get on the list for 20 minutes only to discover the wait for 3 people is at 75 to 90 minutes. Decided to get desserts only and headed to that line. Wait another 20 minutes to place our order for 1 piece of cheesecake, 1 piece of chocolate tower cake, and 1 piece of fudge cake. The staff were clearly overwhelmed and honestly looked like they would prefer to have not worked that night. Not to mention there were a ton of them in the tiny dessert station area. After we ordered our dessert two of us decided to leave the area as it was getting more and more crowded while 1 stayed behind to get the food. As the two of us were leaving we heard an employee telling people the wait for dessert to go orders was at 20 minutes and growing.....would have been nice to know this before hand.  It is interesting that Cheesecake Factory dessert bar not only serves the to go orders but also the entire restaurant too......seems like a design flaw especially in high tourist location of Hawaii in which the restaurant has a wait time most of the time. We enjoyed our 5 Guys Burgers and Fries before heading home and waiting for our dinner to digest before digging into the dessert. Saw quite a few C.F. employees at 5 Guys too for a smoke break and quick bite to eat. I personally like Cheesecake Factory and approx 1 month ago waited 2 hours for a party of 10 to be seated for dinner. As frustrated as I was waiting the food definitely was worth the wait. Same in this case as frustrating as it was waiting in line to check in, then waiting in line to order dessert, then waiting to get the dessert all three items were on point and definitely worth it all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=80

We ordered ahi tartar, Korean cauliflower, stuffed mushrooms, crab bites and avocado spring roles. Each dish was amazing. The tartar is quite small, 4 wonton like chips served with ahi over avocado and a soy ginger sauce, amazing taste. The Korean cauliflower had a hint of spice but not over powering and to our surprise the cauliflower is tempura style. Next was the avocado rolls, and what  a different appetizer this was. It tasted so fresh and light. Stuffed mushrooms and crab bites come with 6 pieces each and are so tasty.  Each of these dishes are off the small plate menu, but shared amongst 3 people it was just enough.  For dessert we had the strawberry short cake, the chocolate truffle tower, and the apple crisp. The strawberry short cake was a bit disappointing as the cake was more like a biscuit and a bit hard, the chocolate cake was nice when the strawberries and ice cream were taken from the strawberry short cake. The Apple crisp was a bit sweet, so we weren't able to finish to many bites.

Lorie G.,"Kapolei, HI",78,34,37,5.0,11/21/2017,"One thing I love about the Cheesecake Factory is that they give you buzzers when you check in so that you don't have to wait around if you don't want to, and shop your hearts content around the mall until your buzzer signals.   I haven't had to wait too long for a table - at most, 30 minutes at this location and I've visited 3 times since it opened in September. The wait staff is very friendly, the food is tasty, and I love their skinny menu which all food items are under 590 calories. I decided to eat the turkey burger from the skinny menu and added avocado - it was juicy and I can't believe the calorie content was low! The waitress even brought us fresh bread that just came out of the oven and topped with butter - oooh child - it was carb heaven!  My third visit, we had a party of 6. We let the waitress know that we were going to the movies, so we needed our food out in a reasonable amount of time.

They were awesome! I've eaten at a lot of fast pace restaurants and have had a lot of great servers, but I can honestly say that this duo topped them all. Not to mention, I was part of a 17 person party. Every single one of us felt as if we were catered to. All of our food came out around the same time within 10 minutes of ordering; now when does that ever happen with a 10+ party?... never. Splitting the check between a big party has always been a hassle and sometimes defers people to ask; but these two made it happen effortlessly!!  Now let's talk about the food, I ordered the Bistro Shrimp pasta and my boyfriend ordered the Steak Diane & Chicken Madeira. My pasta was perfect, it  wasn't too creamy but had just the right amount of sauce and was loaded with shrimp (which a lot of places are usually stingy with the shrimp.) My boyfriend is usually very picky when it comes to his steaks, but he loved it. Also, the Chicken Madeira wasn't dry and was filled with flavor! You know how a lot of chicken dishes are usually really dry and lack flavor? Well this one wasn't!!  I can't stress this enough, when you come here, try and get Kelli or Alexis to be your server, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

Drinks took about 20 min to come out. The food took way longer than normal and by then we weren't hungry.  The potatoes served with the breakfast menu items were so over cooked there weren't any potatoes left....it was basically empty burnt shells of what used to be potato cubes.

Greg A.,"Honolulu, HI",408,131,818,5.0,10/20/2017,"When you come to a Cheesecake Factory, it is generally like a McDonald's. However, burgers here are much larger! I say that with high respects in the essence of the restaurant chain's consistency. Service here is on par with excellence. If food not good, they will return it and if certain cases, they will not charge you. I even see old faces since this place is near my home town. Service is very professional and many kinds of personalities. Within the past four times I have eaten here since they have opened, we have waited for almost two hours on weekend nights. However, it does depend on whether you want to dine in the air-conditioned side versus the lanai (outdoors) area.  On those week nights after 9pm, we were given a 45 minute wait and we actually got in before their 45-minute estimate! I also was very pleased with Sabrina, she is a sweet Southern woman here. If you have her, she would help you decide on what to order for the indecisive folks. The menu here is very extensive and offers a ""skinny-licious"" menu where you have smaller portions and healthy alternatives. The regular menu portions are very deluxe. I love their signature meat loaf. Roasted and made fresh, and it comes with their mashed potatoes but you can substitute for their house salad with their mango dressing. Sooo good! Oh and for those who want tex-mex, you must try their loaded chicken enchiladas. It has so much flavor and cheese loaded in the flour tortillas! Just make sure you ask for the sour cream on the side and not on top. The courtesy molasses and sour dough bread is also very yummy and refillable.  Mac and cheese bites are so bomb! If you come here for breakfast, their waffles are also a great way to start your weekend. Cheesecake here is hit or miss for me. I still think its more on the creamy side and not as rich. There is much sweet taste, which for sure fulfill sweet-tooths here. The pumpkin cheesecake with pecans was more pecan-dominant and was not a fan. However, the tuxedo cheesecake is very good for chocolate fans. Not to sweet, has that mix of milk and dark chocolate flavors. However, I feel that their single slices are huge. All of them are, except the splenda-sugared ones. They look of it plain with no whipped cream and nothing decorated in it. What helps you enjoy it is the graham cracker crust. Pretty much safe like for those who are diabetic.  Many people gripe about their wait for their food, and so if you do not care for everyone to get their food at the same time, just inform your server to send it out when it arrives. You can even consider having an entree to share as an app. Based on the four times I have dined in, we have waited for about 25 to 30 minutes. Never have I ever experienced more than an hour unless you have a huge party I presume. The party sizes I have come with were with 3 or 5 peeps, so the avg family can muster the wait.  Overall, great service, food, and quality all within a place that is great for families, dates, and catching up with friends. They also have a buzzer that will reach to the Kamakana Ali'i stage, movie theater, and H&M.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=60

Jenny N.,"Honolulu, HI",8,67,126,5.0,11/3/2017,"Update 11/3/2017 Customer service was great, thank you for addressing the problem.  10/31/2017 840 pm This experience is based off of the first time dining here.  First off, we thought we would be able to put our names in and walk around, since there usually is a wait at the waikiki one. Went in, asked how long the wait for 2 is, hostess at the front said now! Cool! We get to go in without a wait!  Our hostess that led us to the table is a very professional and polite man, I think his name was Ty. He had glasses. He handed us menus in an elegant manner, and even bowed! And told us that our waitress Nicole will be with us shortly. Awesome service so far! Great job front desk! I wanted to see how fast we would get in and out of this place so I decided to put some fun in our dinner and set a timer.  We look around and the place isn't really that busy, our section isn't at least.  There was a table of six next to us, but already had appetizers.  The waitress Nicole was there but we didn't have any water on our table to start off. I was really really thirsty. I had just gotten off a really long day 12 hour shift back to back work. This table took a while to order. So in the mean time, it would have been nice if she had walked away to get drinks, give the big table some time to order, then come back. Anyway, she took their orders. Timer now says 26 minutes. There was a male waiter, he kind of saw me looking around, always caught a glimpse of weird eye contact and disappears. He came back with two waters for us and we weren't even his table! He managed to take the orders for his table and helped us out also.  Okay, so now Nicole comes back. Now at 40 minutes into our dinner, we just ordered the spinach and cheese dip to start then two pastas. 20 minutes later, 1 hour into the entire wait, were wondering where the appetizer is. At this point my boyfriend and I are starved. She comes back and tells us ""oops. My fault. I accidentally put your appetizer and your entrees in with the same order."" So basically what this means is our pastas and our appetizer will come out all at the same time. Wow! What's the point? Still, we were charged for the chips and cheese. She then offered to sponsor one cheesecake slice. Cool. That's nice of her.  Another 10 or so minutes, everything comes out onto our table. Two pastas, one big plate of cheese and chips brought out by a busser. Then, Nicole comes out a lot later, didn't check if all our food had come out yet. I didn't touch my pasta, because I usually like the fact that they come out with the parm cheese and grate it on top of the pasta for you. This time, we had to ASK if they could help us out with that. Wow... again, the place is DEAD in our section.  We eat our food, plenty of left overs, it is 1 hour and 20 minutes into the meal. She asks us if we can choose the cheese cake we wanted. I chose one.  My boyfriend chose one. And I had asked her to put them in to go boxes so we can munch a little then grab and go.  We wait a while I had to stand a little to look for her. Couldn't find her. So I walked up to the front desk, asked Ty, our original host, why we couldn't find Nicole, and why our order that we had put in a while ago wasn't coming to the table.  He apologized so quickly and replied promptly to my request regarding my questions so I went back to my table. Good job Ty!  Nicole runs up with the check in hand and a regular plate with a melted Adam's cheesecake in hand. Apologized and said, ""Oh my god, I am so sorry. I thought there was a runner. But the runner went home and I didn't know.""  Wait hold up. What? You had a runner that you didn't know that had to leave work? So, that's why maybe checking the table to see if they had gotten everything the way it should be planned...  On top of that, she only came by with one Cheesecake when we had ordered two. I asked her to put it in a to go container, like I originally ordered. And mentioned the Oreo cheesecake also.  I really wanted to give her a chance, but seeing the situation with the section she had; empty, the outside tables empty, and the entire back of the restaurant empty, and with plenty of waiters and waitresses waiting around... I would like to think she did not have a lot going on. But I'm just assuming.  Waikiki's restaurant is the busiest in the nation, or so I've heard. But the entire wait/check in/dine in/cash out process goes by so smoothly, that Waikiki's restaurant cuts today's time in HALF.  Total dine in time: almost two hours.  We ended up taking the two cheese cakes home, his of which is melted and mine.  Would I come back here to eat? Definitely not. Total wait time and dine in time at the Waikiki Cheesecake Factory equals LESS than what I've experienced at this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=60

Although one of them dropped my wife's entree and they gave her a salad to tie her over. We were all done eating by the time her food arrived so she didn't enjoy it at all. I ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi with pasta. I was disappointed with the portion and the scampi hardly had any taste of garlic. The white chocolate cheesecake with caramel was too sweet. Should've stuck with the traditional. Definitely not returning until the nostalgia dies down. Maybe they should concentrate on less menu items and focus more on quality.

Shaela M.,"Kapolei, HI",3,57,51,5.0,11/8/2017,"They have a really big menu. From pasta to steak, to chicken & burgers/salads/soups/fish etc. although the wait my be long depending on time of arrival, it is definitely worth the wait. I ordered the pizza & salad combo. The food is very tasteful. The crust of the pizza had a softness yet slight crunch to it which I really enjoyed.  I also had a strawberry ice tea & not lemonade but it tasted like it was all lemonade & no ice tea with a little hit of strawberry. It could've used a little more strawberry. But Being that it was lemonade tasting, I drank it anyway. It tasted good but could use way more strawberry. Their Oreo cheesecake is bomb, especially with the big huge Oreo cookie with no white cream that is in the inside of a normal Oreo.  I highly recommend NOT PASSING UP on dessert. Their cheesecakes are bomb & so goooooooddddd. My coworkers all got different types of cheesecakes & they all enjoyed theirs.  I HIGHLY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLACE & I HIGHLY WOULD COME BACK, the only thing is that sometimes there could be a long wait, sometimes 1.5 hours is what I've heard.

Not sure what the hype is all about.... anyways we came to cheesecake factory around 3PM, it wasn't really busy so we sat at the bar. Ordered two cucumber mojito & it was great. I love that they have a ""skinny"" menu which had food items that were a little lower on calories. We got the salmon rolls and they were tasty, but super skimpy. We mostly got the wrapper and barely any salmon. We ended our lunch with a round of shots. Finally we got the bill & it was $60 bucks lol. Blew my mind because the cocktails were $13 each, $13 for the skimpy salmon rolls and shots were skimpy too. $10 for Jameson? Yuckkkk. And to top it off, as we were leaving we found out happy hour is at 4PM.. very overpriced and definitely not worth the money.

Everything we ordered was delicious. Seriously, the luau salad is PERFECT. It's huge! My husband and I shared and it was more than enough.  Our table had the crab bites, grilled steak medallions, grilled salmon, luau salad, kids meal sliders, a Heineken, and a pineapple mojito all for under $100 - not including tip. Everything we ordered was delicious. Nothing went to waste. I had to take away one star just because everything took a little time, but that was expected for it being so busy.

We usually go to Waikiki location so we were prepared to wait 2-3 hrs. The waiter was great took our order of drinks, appetizers, meals and desserts one time since a few people at our table wanted dessert 1st. Timing between appetizers and meals was perfect. My mom said her pork chops was a little on the dry side but other then that everyone enjoyed the meal. Seating inside, outside and at bar. Restrooms of course. Lots of parking being part of the mall but I personally thinking the parking is small for a mall this size. If you just want to order cheesecake they have a counter when you enter. I like the ambiance at this location better than Waikiki bcuz its not as dark and it feels more lively.

Perfect because we were celebrating a birthday as well (yes, they sing happy birthday). This dinner was for training purposes & they did so well. We were so full by the end of the night & we even had a handful of bags filled with left overs. Our waitress (Vanessa) & her trainer (Joe) were very good to us. They explained everything to us in detail and provided us with great customer service.  We came as a big party so we were seated outside in the same section but with four separate tables. We were asked to treat it like we were four separate parties (for training). We were all given a different section of the menu to allow the cooks to ""familiarize themselves with the flow in the kitchen"" as we were told. The food came in very generous amounts, by the time we got to our entree's we were so full! We got pasta & a salad TO SHARE but we barely even got to touch it. The appetizer they suggested has to be my favorite dish of the night, buffalo blasts; never tried anything like it anywhere else! lol Now for the CHEESECAKE, because cheesecake factory duh.

Katherine N.,"Downtown, Honolulu, HI",90,60,612,5.0,9/29/2017,"Decided to try the Cheesecake Factory because everything else was closed at 10pm. I WOULD go to the Cheesecake Factory for every meal if I could, but it's definitely on the pricier side. Nonetheless, I was super hungry and I caved in. RIP wallet. It's okay though, was worth it.  PARKING: This new location is located in the new mall at Kapolei, so there's a TON of free parking. Yup, definitely don't have to worry about parking here (as opposed to the Waikiki location lol). SERVICE: We came around 10pm so there was no wait! Got seated right away :) Service was awesome! Jacob (I think that was his name?) was our server and he was very friendly and attentive! Brought our drinks and food out at a reasonable time. Asked if we were doing okay and if we needed anything else. Didn't have to go looking for him at any point in time.  FOOD: For drinks, my bf ordered the Sam Adams and I got the Red Sangria. The Sangria was yummy!! However, they put way too much ice and too little sangria lol! For food, I got the shrimp scampi and steak combo with angel hair pasta. My bf got the fish tacos. As you would expect, food is to die for! Steak was cooked perfectly and had these mushrooms on top that I wanted more of. (Actually ordered more mushrooms as a side). The fish tacos was the best I ever had and I tried a lot of fish tacos from different restaurants. We were stuffed, but when you're at the Cheesecake Factory, you HAVE to order Cheesecake. Unfortunately, since it was the end of the night, they were out of a lot of cheesecakes :( We opted to get the cookie dough cheesecake. That was alright, kinda was looking forward to trying that new celebration cheesecake they had.  Overall, everything was awesome!

Just as delicious. I got the rib eye meal, which was very tender and delish. The rib eye steak was just a bit over salted, but I like things a bit salty.

Took one star because it's strictly first come first serve, even for large parties.  Can't believe a restaurant this size doesn't have designated large party tables & time slots. The second star for having to wait over an hour and a half for our food.   BUT... alas,  they took back a star and redeemed themselves.  Just as we're wondering where tf is our food,  the manager comes in and introduces herself.  Apologized for the long wait.  She brought out bread & salads & fries.  Talked to my son,  who was being very dramatic and dying of starvation,  she made sure he was all good. She also turned the music down.  Before that,  we could barely hear each other,  and the sound was so distorted.  It was awful.   So over all,  the only negative thing I can say about my experience is that the volume of the music was the worst aspect.  The music was way to loud, and the sound system was terrible.

Jackie O.,"Mililani, HI",19,219,524,4.0,10/1/2017,"Of course, the number one and initial downside to coming here was expected upon arrival...the wait!! It's a reminder of how I sometimes want to move away from Hawaii because on the mainland there are SO many options of places to eat and then so many option locations of 1 place to eat such as Cheesecake Factory so there never seems to be a wait. My friend and I went to the one at the Americana in Glendale and there was no such chaos as the one at Kamakana Ali'i or Waikiki for that matter.  Luckily, last night at the Kapolei location, we sneakily slid in at the reservations counter and got a buzzer right away with a forty minute wait, but we ended up relinquishing the buzzer because we got two seats at the bar which is first-come-first-serve seating. Our waiter, Michael, who's part of the bar team was so nice and personable. He gave us insight to various appetizer options as I was leaning toward the egg roll sampler. I'm glad we got that because it was good and as Michael mentioned, 'it allows you to try all eggrolls.' I ordered my usual Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my boyfriend got his usual, hibachi steak with mashed potatoes. The bow tie pasta in my dish seemed a little undercooked, but nothing major. The wait was also really long to get our food, and I think our waiter Michael recognized that because shortly after he acknowledged that our food 'was taking awhile but will be out shortly,'  the manager came to apologize to us and assure us that our food will be coming soon. The prices seemed to be a little more than I remember it at the Waikiki location. I'm not sure if that's because it's a brand new location or if it's normal inflation and those higher prices are also currently reflected at the Waikiki location. In any case, they do give so much especially my pasta. I can never finish it so it's like two meals since I always take the leftovers to go. When ready to leave, we ordered a whole red velvet Cheesecake to take home since my sister and her family is staying with us before they move to LV. We had them write on it, but since they don't actually write on the top of the Cheesecake, they will write on a plaque of chocolate (either white or milk), which is then put on the cheesecake. I wish they had someone with nicer penmanship to do the writing. It didn't come out too nice (I attached a picture). The wait too on the bakery side was long. The area space is a little tight that you feel like you're in the way when waiting for your order.  On the upside, they had nice live music while we were eating...not sure who the band was but they sang nice Hawaiian music.  Overall good experience! It's just the wait (both to get a table and for your food) and the chaos that compromises the overall experience, but I would come here again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=100
Chantelle M.,"Waipahu, HI",53,23,20,4.0,10/7/2017,"Love that they finally opened a Cheesecake Factory on the west side! Beats driving all the way to the Waikiki location where you would have to find and pay for parking.  It was three days after their grand opening, and I came in on a weekday at about 5:00. I was hesitant at first to go because I've heard of the long wait time since it's still new. However, because it was just a party of two, our total wait time was about only 10-15 minutes.  The servers seem like that they're trying to get a hang of things, which gives them an excuse as to why it took forever for a server to come to our table to ask what we would like to drink. After ordering our drinks, it took even longer to get them.  It was a busy night, being that it was grand opening week. Therefore, it honestly took about an hour to hour and a half to receive our entrees. The two parties to the left and right of us were also waiting a while for their entrees. It took so long that the manager had to come and make his rounds to apologize to everyone for the long wait. I did notice that the kitchen looked pretty busy, so it's understandable.

First time we were seated quickly because we came at the right time which there was no waiting time around 2pm on a Sunday, which made it nice. Waitress was pleasant and friendly. We ordered the steak Diane and it was off the hook delicious. The food was oh so GOOD!! The drinks not so much maybe cause we just didn't know how to order, we were told that there isn't any flavored iced teas which made me sad but we moved on to the latte which was good but it took a while before we got it and we ordered dessert, the chocolate tower cake so so chocolatey. But when it came to paying our check we had a set back cause it took some time which we were wondering why but we eventually did.  Second visit, wait time was 50 minutes which I didn't feel all that bad because this other lady's wait time was 90 minutes so we get in and it was a little chaotic because we were called but when I said ""here"" the hostess by passed me and took someone else, so sad how i felt then we were seated by the same lady and this time she showed us to a table for 2 when we were a Party of 5?????Huh??? Was I confused that's a big YES???!! Mind you she grabbed 5 menus but seated us on a table for 2??? Ok ok I understand that your busy so again I over looked this mistake because we all have those days. Now we are all seated outside and the experience was so wonderful and pleasant, talk about they went the extra mile to make it right. The waiters and waitresses was on target !!! They saved the day for me!!! If the hostesses fail, the waitresses and waiters will make it up big time!! The way I look at things concerning other restaurants is some have their pluses and some have their minuses but it all depends on how you look at things and the situation on that day. So remember we all make mistakes and we all have bad days but if the restaurants try their best to make it better why now give it another try!!!

Always indecisive about what to get, so I chose items from the light portions. Greek salad was the right portion, crab cakes was really good being its small little balls.

The husband and son said the salmon egg rolls were pretty good, I thought the avocado egg role wasn't anything more than avocado in an egg roll wrapper... kinda soggy too.... but the 2 other egg rolls (southwest chicken and some other one with chicken) were soooo good!! Our lunch size pastas came out pretty quick too. We ordered cheesecake to go since we were way too full to eat it there. Man oh man the lemon meringue cheesecake is heaven!

Then no one showed, half a hour passed still no one had come by to even greet us or to order drinks. Finally waved down a bus boy and complained. More time went by about 15 minutes later we flagged another server down. She was great and came back after about minutes and took our drink order. About 5 minutes after that the lady who was supposed to be our server and the manager (stephanie) came over. They both apologized and took the rest of out order. Our drinks finally showed up after we had been there for a hour and 15 minutes. The rest of the dinner was more of the same, one of our appetizers never showed up but we didn't complain bc we were getting full. It took so long that appetizers came out same time as main meal. Then two of us ordered cheesecake to go. Manager came back over at the end and took the two cheesecakes off the tab, however seemed a small thing for having a table be forgotten about for 45 mins.  Other food is actually really good, I had fish and chips (cod), wife had seared ahi salad. Both were very well done. The rest of our group all very much enjoyed the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=100
Arrianne D.,"Kapolei, HI",60,31,70,4.0,10/2/2017,"Finally! ate lunch here yesterday (Sunday)! yay! I haven't been to the Waikiki location, so this was my 1st time to dine in here. Since this restaurant just  recently opened, the wait for a table was 1hr to 2hrs! I'm not surprised, but seriously thou you need eat something before you come here or dine in here sometime next year! :) In a nutshell: For party of 4, we waited 45mins for a table, service was kinda slow since the restaurant is packed! We ordered some drinks and appetizers and our entree took 1hr to come out, so the Manager offered us free cheesecakes! yay! Food (5 out of 5): they offer plenty choices and serving sizes are big! For apps, we ordered beet salad and tex mex eggrolls! those eggrolls was the best! for our entrees, we ordered: chxn & waffle benedict, bellagio pasta, and some breaded chicken with mash potatoes (not sure what was the name). For dessert, we ordered Dulce de Leche! yum! our fave cheesecake flavor! Everything was good! Service (5 out of 5): our waitress was friendly and attentive BUT be prepared to wait. Ambience (5 out of 5): very nice decor!  Overall, I will come back again with family and friends!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=100
Phil V.,"Honolulu, HI",284,84,89,4.0,9/23/2017,"Wanted come here cuz i really like this restaraunt and the one in Waikiki is such a hassle to get to. It opens at 1130, but got there around 1045 and was the 5th person in line. By the Time it officially opened, there was about 30 or so ppl behind us. Once they opened they quickly got us in and got us seated which was good. Took our orders....as you all know Cheesecake Factory has soo many items to choose from, u might get overwhelmed. So my suggestion would be to look at their menu online first so you have an idea of what you would like. I ordered the Avocado Toast, and the Chicken Riesling. Food took a little longer than expected but the bread kept us occupied. The avocado Toast was hella bomb! Kinda wish I didn't share it haha. Then my chicken came, it was really good as well! All cooked to perfection.  The only thing is tho, once we were done with our food, we ordered desert (Cheesecake of course) but we waited about 20 or so minutes for our Cheesecake. Granted it got more busy but we had to flag our waiter down to see what the deal was on the wait. She didn't check in with us or anything letting us know why it was taking long. The meal was perfect up till that point so that's why I gave it 4stars instead of 5. I know they just opened so I'll give them a little handicap for that..... Anyways overall good experience, good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=100

Jessica P.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",122,84,116,3.0,12/1/2017,"We went to this new location today because we were on this side of the island today. We love the one in Waikiki.  I was expecting a long wait because it's a Friday night, but we were seated immediately. That was a welcome surprise because we were starving! After arriving at the table, however, we waited about 15 minutes before a waitress finally came over to the table and asked if our server had come to the table yet... we told her no and she immediately apologized and took our drink and dinner orders. She told us that we were not in her section, but that she would take care of us. We were so thankful to just finally get some food.  The place was pretty packed, so there was a bit of a wait for the food. It came out about 20-30 minutes after we ordered, but was all hot and delicious. The manager did come over and apologize for the other server forgetting about us, but was very nice and thanked us for our patience.  Besides the wait for service and the food, the server that did take care of us and the manager were very nice. We enjoyed the food and would probably go back if we were not moving soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=100
Katherine R.,"Green Valley, AZ",20,51,11,5.0,11/28/2017,Went here for my husband's birthday. We were seated almost straight away which was nice because I was hearing how packed it was when it first opened and dreading a long wait. The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice. They even have a live band playing which is a super cool touch. Our server was very attentive despite it being really busy. She frequently checked up on us throughout our meal. I was impressed.  We ordered a mojito each for drinks and the fried calamari as an appetizer. Both were excellent. Loved the amount of mint they put in the mojito. Your meal also comes with two types of complimentary bread. Both delicious. For entree my husband got the habatchi steak and I got the shrimp and chicken gumbo. Both have excellent flavours but I preferred mine. The gumbo has a really tasty smoked flavour from the sausage they put in the dish. For dessert we ordered the Christmas seasonal peppermint bark cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake. Loved them. Tasted amazing but unfortunately we could not finish it as we were both bursting at the seams. Overall this place deserves 5 stars. It was a really nice evening for my husband's birthday. I recommend this place to anyone wanting a nice dining out experience. If you order cocktails it can get a little pricey but totally worth it for a special occasion. I leave the island shortly but might come back for a cheeky slice of delicious cheesecake. Thanks for a memorable time Cheesecake Factory Kapolei!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=100

Had to wait in line to get seated and finally got sat at 10:30. We had already took a look at the menu so we knew what we wanted to get. Ordered our food and drinks at 10:36. The food came out at 11:27 and the rest of our parties food came out at 11:32. We finished our lunch at 12:00 and started to look over the cheesecake menu. Our cheesecakes finally came out at 12:24. Overall, our food took really long to come out, waiting an hour for our lunch and 20 minutes for cheesecake.  3 stars for the taste of the food (can't go wrong with cheesecake and their food is always great). Not 5 stars because of how long everything took to come out.  Side note- at least our server was really nice! I'm pretty sure she was training, her name is Nicole F.

When we got there it was already a lot of people waiting outside. But we got seated within 30 minutes we're only a party of 3 but the front hosts we're organized, patient and not overwhelmed with the amount of people coming in at all directions asking questions and checking in.  We got greeted by the friendliest server Aaron E. He had the best attitude and so attentive and never skipped a beat. He really made our dining experience that much greater. We were sat outside which is kinda nice cause it is very noisy inside but it was drizzling rain that day. We let Aaron E. know and right away a manager came to put the screens down. There was even a hawaiian band that night and they were good. Everything was great even the food. We felt the food came in a timely manner, we even managed to order and split 2 desserts. The Hersheys bar cheesecake has to be the best. But we just might have to come back to try more. I hope that they keep up the good work.

Debbie G.,"Mililani, HI",86,14,22,3.0,12/10/2017,"Wait to be seated - the women selling gift cards outside said there was no wait so we decided to try it.   Walked in and there was a line at the hostess stand but 5 minutes later when it was our turn we were told to step on the side we would be seated right away.   We waited another 2 minutes and were seated.   Ordering - The first waitress was very friendly and got our drink orders right away and brought us sour dough and honey brown bread to munch on while we looked over their extensive menu.   After she returned she introduced our second waitress ""Regina"".   She too was very friendly and took our food order.   We didn't have to wait too long for our food but asked for more bread while we waited.    Regina came back with just the sour dough bread but said she would return with the brown bread when it can out of the oven.  She didn't.  Food came out hot.   Large portions and very tasty.  From there it went down hill. Regina gave us 5 minutes to try our food and then came back to see how we were doing. She barely waited long enough to hear our answer and never came back until we had someone call her.   She never refilled water or my over $3 soda which was still 2/3's filled with ice when I finished the soda.  It's hard to finish your food without a beverage to wash it down with so we finally gave up and asked a manager to pack up our food and give us the bill.    She compensated us by giving me a soda to go but I still paid for the 1/3 cup soda I had at the table.    Regina and a few other servers spent a majority of our meal talking to the customers two table away from ours.  Even the check presentation was rushed.   Food was good so we would try it again They just need to work on their customer service skills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=120
Catherine Y.,"Kapolei, HI",0,9,58,5.0,10/26/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory and am super excited they opened closer to home! Who: party of 2 (just me & bf) When: Sunday evening 6pm Wait time: ***THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS :(      we were told 50 min and given a buzzer but were seated in 20m:) There were 2 bigger parties ahead of us but we definitely seemed to beat the dinner rush. Where: we chose to be seated inside the restaurant as the weather was very rainy that day (they do have covered outside seating with blinds to pull down), we were shown to a very private and spacious 2 seat booth in the middle of the restaurant. ***10/10 will be coming back regularly :) NO RESERVATIONS fyi, so be prepared to wait 1+ hrs if you come during the lunch/dinner hour with a big party. I am verrrry understanding about this and both times came with a party of only 2 people so my wait was very short! Please don't get upset with the staff over long wait times, plan better and come early or after peak hours to avoid crazy wait times! -Both times I've been here I had a small party so we got seated a lot quicker then bigger parties that have to wait for big booths, the 2 seat booths are very private and spacious. They have high partitions so you won't see your neighbors and can have easy conversation without fighting to be heard, and I love that the table is big enough for food and drinks unlike some places where the tiny round tabletops barely fit two plates. -We were offered complimentary bread, a basket of sour dough and whole grain with butter. I love the whole grain but I would love the sour dough more if they had balsamic vinegar sauce hehe, its okay though. -Our waitress was very attentive and checked in on us regularly at appropriate intervals and even told us the specials they had and recommendations. FOOD: I got the Gumbo and I've had this a couple of times at other places and loved it enough to want to try Cheesecakes version, DELISH! Spicy and saucy and so good with white rice! My bf got the Hibachi Steak- medium. It was cooked perfectly and came with many sides like asparagus, mashed potatoes, and bean sprouts yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=120
Crystal F.,"Ewa Beach, HI",296,4,6,3.0,10/2/2017,"So obviously there was going to be a wait ... right so look forward to that when you go...  Got seated after a 50 min wait, the waitress took our drink order promptly. Drinks came 15 minutes later after we ordered.    Ordered our appetizers, I got the Chicken Potstickers, my guy ordered the Thai Chicken Wraps.  When they arrived a random waiter brought the apps, he had raved about how the Potstickers was going to be the best ones I'll ever eat on this island. For me being a Dim Sum connoisseur I had high hopes for these. Meh I ate one and definitely was not impressed, they were sitting in a shoyu/vinegar watery base and the inside was just chopped up white chicken meat. It was on the very dry side. ( I could have gone next door to CPK and gotten way better potstickers over there). The Thai Chicken wraps were very nicely plated, everything looked very enticing. This came with three styles of dips, one was a cilantro style (yuck, would be great for burritos) next was a peanut butter style ( best one in my opinion ) and last was the sweet chili pepper kind.. also was good.   For our entree my guy ordered the fish and chips, . We go out somewhere nice and he ordered something that he can get everywhere else... .  As for me I got the Factory Meatloaf. Our waitress informed us that there was going to be a 45 minute delay for my plate. I shrugged and said that's fine cause I eat like a bird and needed time to settle after our apps.   We finally got our dinner, I had a couple bites  and that was it for me I was full to the brim. Same thing for my guy. We packaged up our food and got the Lemon raspberry cheesecake to go with. That cake was so yummy..   Overall I think it was fun but expensive and expect to be sitting for long periods of time.

MelissaAnne B.,"Honolulu, HI",1,6,7,4.0,11/11/2017,"UPDATE: went to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate a birthday. We checked in at 5:30 pm and we're told that our party of 8 was a 2 hour wait, which is why we checked in early. We walked around the mall during the wait. After 2 hours we returned and waited for another 20 min till our buzzer rang. The wait time wasn't so bad. It was a reasonable wait. Waiter: she was really friendly. I forgot her name :(  Service: 2 managers came by to greet us and notify us that the food were about to come out. And since our appetizer came our after our entree, we got that free. Thank you!! I can definitely say that the service was much quicker and very well improved.!  Quality: the food was good. But the rice was hard. It was more of a crumble on our plate. You could feel the texture, and it felt uncooked. Those who got steak at medium rare. Received their steak cooked to perfection! The pasta I had was the bistro, which was AMAZING. And everyone else's foods seemed to taste good as well. Other than that, everything was amazing! Opinion: I love Cheesecake Factory and I enjoy that they have improved their service from when I visited the first time!  --------------- Decided to wait a while till the rush slowed down. But the support of the community filled the place with joy and excitement and because we wanted to celebrate my little brothers birthday!  we checked in at 8:11pm and were told the wait was 90 min. We were given a paper slip and asked to return within that time zone. Since the mall was still open, we decided to walk around a bit. We returned at 8:50 ish and the crowd definitely lessened before our given time. We got our buzzer and waited for about 5 more minutes, which we were thankful since the people we seen arrive later than us get called in before we did.   Waiter: she was so friendly. Her name was Angel I believe? She went beyond her efforts to get us a manager to explain why our food took so long. And the teamwork that it took to get our food out at one time.!  Service: where can I start?. Let's just say that the group next to us were served their food first before we did. When we got seated, their table was still filled with the leftovers from the last party. So we got kind of concerned. Our food arrived at 10:12... which is like more than an hour since we sat down. BUT... we were greeted by the manager and were told that our food got ""mixed up"" ‍ we ended up not staying to get the birthday treat or a cheesecake since it was already 10:40 and that's almost 3 hours of our time that was spent at Cheesecake Factory... mind that the food took almost more than an hour.  Quality: the pasta was not cooked (it was very hard to pick up with my fork. I had to poke at it harder than usual) and looked very dry. The plate was hot but the food was very much cooled down...  Opinion: although the first visit to our newly opened Cheesecake Factory was not the 'best', I can't deny that I won't return. Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. And hopefully when I return, I will not be writing the same review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=120
Kim W.,"Honolulu, HI",155,11,,2.0,11/13/2017,So the reason behind my 2 star review is for a number for reasons.  I'll start that we got seated right away which was good.  Now this is where the 2 Star review come into starts.  It took the server about 5 minutes to come to the table to greet us.  We ordered the buffalo blast which was very salty.  Then we waited about 30 minutes plus for our dinner.  The server did apologize saying there was a big party's order in front of ours and the sad thing is that she forgot what ordered.    While waiting for our food she said that they'll comp our cheesecake which it was nice.  Once we got our food our server asked if we know what kind of cheesecake we wanted.. which made us feel rushed.  I got the shrimp with angel hair my other half got the meatloaf.  Both food was super salty and since we didn't want to wait again for something else we just ate it. I've been here while they did their test run and service and food was good. But I don't know what happened?!?  I think I'll just come to pick up cheesecake and not dine in.  Sorry it's really not worth the wait especially on a weekday!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=120

Basilio M.,"Kapolei, HI",3,82,35,4.0,11/4/2017,"2017.11.03:  So to be clear this is the actual first time I've ever been to any Cheesecake Factory.  The last check in I never made it to even get a pager to wait for a table.  So tasty is my first real check in.  So far we have ordered and there is live music jam only a table away.  I'm liking the tunes.      So didn't get our appetizers when an appetizer was supposed to come out.  Though they apologized, it is still a miss.  Server and manager very helpful, though really I'm not concerned about the apology simply get my order to me.  All considered I will likely come again.      Sooo many people not sure the cook situation but such a large crowd may need more folks, meal took about 30 mins to get to us.  That is after it took 5 min to check in, and 1 hour to get page for the open table.  Not sure how much longer they can stay the ""thing"" in Kapolei if they don't speed up time.  There are many options to head out to in Kapolei, though they do have Cheesecake.        Truth be told I really want them to succeed and become a cornerstone.  Despite the problems I understand that they care about the folks they serve so they earned a 4 Star Dragonball.  If they can pull off the Japanese fluffy Cheesecake I may be very driven to give them a try sooner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=120
Julianne O.,"Waipahu, HI",494,203,851,3.0,10/16/2017,"I have mixed feelings about this place. We were invited to their pre-opening test runs and had a FANTASTIC experience, however I felt that it was not a fair experience to base my review on.  So we actually decided to go on opening day for happy hour.  Now, I normally don't go to ANY restaurant openings and avoid crowds at all costs, however, we had such a great experience prior that we were so excited to return.  It actually wasn't too bad since we came early for happy hour and bar seating is first come first serve- we waited about 10 mins for a high-top.  We arrived around 4:30pm for their great happy hour that had a nice selection of foods and discounted drinks.  Throughout the night, we were joined by more and more people, mostly industry people from other Food & Beverage outlets and hotels who wanted to scope things out.  Service was slow but we totally expected that on their first night so didn't really mind waiting.  The only thing we had an issue with was one of our friends ordered the ""fried cheese"" (essentially cheese sticks), that had not come out for about an hour.  We kept asking the waiter who was very apologetic and nice about it which we appreciated but yet, still no cheese sticks.  Eventually we decided to tell a manager about it and after a while, we finally got the cheese sticks an hour and a half later. SO I know this is a sensitive subject and this story is one-sided so it's impossible for Yelpers reading this to get a full understating of the situation without being there so I'll keep it short...a summary of what happened was: After we complained, the manager who helped us get our cheese sticks then came back to our table and started randomly talking about how he knows everyone was in a ""celebration mood"" and that there was a lot of alcohol ordered at the table but he just wants to make sure we get home safe.  Essentially he was cutting us off.  I know he was just trying to do his job, but we felt like the reasons he was cutting us off were: 1. Because we complained  2. Because we had been there for a few hours already (which wasn't our fault since service was extremely slow) and 3. Because we had a large group taking up two tables.  It's impossible to know his real intent but if he truly thought we had too much to drink, then I understand his point of view.  It's a hard thing to determine so I'll just leave it at that. Like I said, we can't hold it against them so we gave them another shot about a month later, hoping things were a little bit smoother.  That experience was very slow as well and when checking the receipt, the server had charged us an extra item we didn't order.  Thankfully they were able to take it off no problem.  We went AGAIN even after this and decided to sit at the actual bar.  I can honestly say that the bar is where we got the best service.  Bartenders were super friendly and attentive.  We really like Cheesecake Factory and want them to succeed but so far we haven't been impressed and the odds of us having a good experience have been quite low.  Let's hope they improve by our next visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=120

Big shouts to our new friend and favorite Kapolei Cheesecake waitress Sheralynn ""I-got yo-refills-before-you-could-ask-for-one"" M... she took care of us good. Despite the mayhem of starving people, busy cooks, and servers running about a marathon, Sheralynn was very communicative when our items was taking a little longer to get out, insightful on the menu and iquiries, patient and overall a pleasure to have as our waitress. She was great and would definitely liked to have her as our waitress anytime...  food was good, service was consistent, restaurant was nice and clean, but the French toast they only serve during brunch was ehh.

Nicole M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",69,12,9,3.0,12/2/2017,"The restaurant is beautiful, idk if it's just me but it gives me a Vegas casino type of feel. The workers are all nice for the most part. I do hate how crowded it is sometimes but I do make sure to go when there is no wait. I do NOT care for the food or for their novel of a menu. First time I went I ordered a shrimp pasta w marinara sauce and there was hardly any sauce on it and there was so much pasta I couldn't finish it. The second time I ordered some type of steak and mashed potatoes from the specials menu and there were too many flavors and too many contrasting flavors. I would've enjoyed it more without the wine sauce they cooked it in. The plate my boyfriend had looked super good till I had a bite of his shrimp and it had a really weird and strong bite to it. It wasn't a spicy bite but it was over-seasoned with something I can't figure out but it was not enjoyable. We did enjoy their drinks. I had the peach Bellini and it was nice and light but I still got that buzz I look for. My boyfriend had a mango something and it was super good I believe he ordered a second one but can't remember. But the CHEESECAKE is to die for. Specifically the original w the strawberry on top. However, the slices do seem a little small, a lot smaller than I remember it being a few years back when I ate at the town location. Don't care for the amount of whipped cream they put in the container also.  Probably won't be eating here for awhile unless we're tired of our usual spots bc I do only live around the corner but for now it will only be a cheesecake crave spot for my boyfriend and I.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=120

Large portions for guacamole and I took my 1/2 sandwich and soup home. Suggestion... Have warm chips to serve.

Jessa F.,"Waipahu, HI",1,5,,5.0,11/6/2017,"I was so excited to find out that they were opening a Cheesecake Factory closer to home because we all know going to Waikiki can be beyond hectic! Today was my first time at the Kapolei location. My boyfriend, kids, & I went first thing in the morning. They opened 10am on Sundays and we got there at about 10:15 am. There was already a pretty long line before it even opened! While waiting, I noticed that there were two large parties ahead of us (I'm taking about 15+ people each party). I'll be completely honestly and say I was getting a bit impatient and was gonna give 4 stars but I had to remind myself that they just opened and already have two large groups to set tables for while still attending to the other customers. While observing the hostess handling both groups and other customers waiting, I believe that they deserve 5 stars for that!  We got finally got seated at about 10:30 and we had a stroller, the host was kind to take our stroller and put up at the front desk so it's out of the way. Our server was awesome! She was quick to refill our drinks, made sure we were all good, packed our food to take home, etc. From beginning to end she showed is excellent service.  My boyfriend & I both got burgers and my son got a kids cheese pizza. I got the Bacon-bacon cheeseburger and my boyfriend got the mushroom burger. We both shared half of our burger, and they were amazing! But be warned that they are really messy to eat! My boyfriend was really surprised to see a piece of fried pork belly (I think it was lol) in the bacon burger. It made the burger that much better because it set itself apart from any ordinary bacon burger. The fries were a bit dry but nothing that bothered me. And the kids pizza was pretty big! For the price plus a drink, it was an A+!  Now just to add a side note, we overheard from the couple next to us found parchment paper in his omelette. I believe the manager on duty was the one to directly came to him and apologized for the incident and offered a couple things to make up for the mistake. Fortunately, he was very understanding and even said he's still gonna eat it all haha.  Overall, we had a great experience! We're so happy we don't need to travel all the way to Waikiki to get some excellent customer service and yummy food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=140

Took a while to be seated but probably since they were just starting their day. When we were finally seated our waiter was quick to take drink orders. House bread was great but for some reason the butter was the best part lol. Our food took a good 20-25 minutes to get to us. I felt like that was a bit long since it was a salad and kids quesadilla. The eggs, potatoes and bagel were just okay nothing fancy but the Santa Fe salad was amazing!!! Love love loved it! Besides the wait for the food everything was fine. I've been to the one in Waikiki many of times and there's no difference at all which was great. Great for family time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=140

Donna V.,"Kapolei, HI",18,124,70,4.0,12/19/2017,"I love that there is a cheesecake factory on the west side. When it first opened I strayed away from eating there since the wait was long (we were told it would be a 4 hour wait). They don't reservations which is a peeve of mine for restaurants. The best times to go would be lunch or early dinner on the weekdays.  Complimentary bread is provided while you look through the menu and order your food. The menu book is extensive so spend some time looking through the menu. Some of my favorite appetizers are the calamari and summer rolls. I have ordered the summer rolls as my meal since it's fulfilling. I love the Cobb salad here, the portions are HUGE and can serve 2 people. My boyfriend likes their loco moco here. The egg is just how he likes it (over easy without being overcooked) and you can order it with fried rice. My favorite cheesecake here is cookie dough. There is lots of parking since it's located in Ka Makana Alii mall. I would call ahead to see what the estimated wait time would be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=140

The doors opened but they were only seating about ten people at a time so we stood in the hot sun for about 25 minutes. Then we were seared. The waitress was nice and gave us recommendations. We had the cheese sticks which were different but tasted good. Then we shared a full order of the luau salad which tasted similar to a Chinese chicken salad with added avocado and it was yummy. We also shared a full order of the falafalle pasta with extra cream sauce and lots of parmesan cheese that was yummy as well. The only thing we ordered too much food. I took away one star for waiting in the hot sun. Other than that there was lots of free parking and the service and food was good.

Greg A.,"Aiea, HI",11,61,238,4.0,10/8/2017,"This was our first time here. We like to go to the one in Waikiki but that place is usually very busy. Since we had a feeling this one would be no different we planned on going between lunch & dinner. We got there around 3:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and was told there would be a 30 minute wait. You're given a pager to notify you when your table is ready. They have an outside waiting area with chairs to make your wait a little more comfortable. We decided to take a short stroll through the mall and was pleasantly surprised to get the page after only 15 minutes. The place is beautiful, spacious & modern looking. I like the way the inside seating is situated. There are a number of 2 people booths as well as larger tables to accommodate big groups. They have an open lanai area which provides even more seating and also features live music after 6pm on the weekend. If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory then the menu will be familiar to you but if you have never been to one the menu can be daunting! Lots and lots of choices. They even have a skinny menu featuring low calorie & healthy entrees. Our server Bryson was very friendly, knowledgeable & efficient. All & all we enjoyed our experience there and would definitely come back again! As we were leaving there was a crowd of people waiting for a table and we were told the wait was about 2 hours!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=140
Shirl M.,"Kapolei, HI",0,15,10,5.0,10/12/2017,"Have been to CCF Kapolei twice now. On both occasions had minimal wait time which likely had to do with luck or times we went!  First time Friday night 5:30. Wait time was 1 hour (which I didn't feel was too bad) however, we were able to get high top table at bar within about 15 minutes (luck) Second time Wednesday afternoon 4:30, no wait - we were seated immediately. There was also live music playing from the outside area!  Service both times was great.  Food was the usual Cheesecake Factory food and was good, quick, hot!  All and all this location opening in Kapolei is the best thing for the westside! And to be honest I feel that the service was exceptional both times.

Dino R.,"Aiea, HI",121,4,7,2.0,9/22/2017,Let me start by saying we absolutely love cheesecake factory. We were so excited to come to the Kapolei location just minutes from our home.  We ordered food at about 7:15PM and were advised that we can pick up curbside in about an hour. We arrived at a very busy curbside pick up at around 8:30PM. We followed the directions of the sign and called to let them know we were there. There was no sign of any employees in the area at curbside.  After calling a second time and physically waving down the only employee we seen outside we were able to get some assistance. Two cars who came after us were helped before they came out with our receipt.   They had me check my order on the receipt which was not correct. They came back to advise me that they are making the corrected plate and it should be out in five minutes. This was at 9:10PM At 9:45 PM we decided to call and speak with a Manager after flagging down yet another employee to ask about the status of our meal.  At about 5 minutes to 10 PM we received our meal.  The only reason there is two stars in this review is because the food was really great. This location needs way more practice with customer service and their curbside pickup option.  I recommend leaving your pets at home and coming dressed to pick up your meal inside. I wish I did.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=140
Ronson O.,"Volcano, HI",1,5,8,1.0,9/28/2017,"I took my wife and young son to eat here on Wednesday, September 27 2017 at about 745 pm. We were joined by our friend and her young son also. Naturally we ordered food for our kids first because they were starving. Their food came out fairly quickly. I would say within ten minutes. At that time the adult decided to order.  This is where it went bad. I ordered an appetizer to snack on and we ordered our entrees at the same time. Long story short, I ended up eating my appetizer for dinner, and my wife who is 7 months pregnant was forced to eat bread and butter with her friend.  The only reason why they are getting a star from me is because the waitress was very nice. The kids ate on time which was the important thing. But we waited for AN HOUR, and the only reason my wife didn't starve is because we had to say something about all the people around us coming and going with their stomachs filled and we were still sitting there.  You might say ""well you must have ordered something pretty hard to make"" or. ""They probably just ran out of an ingredient"". I ordered a cheeseburger with fries. My wife ordered a pasta with chicken. It's a mystery to me why I couldn't eat a nice meal with my family on my night off; Why I couldn't enjoy a new restaurant in our town.

We loved that TV screens above the cheesecake counter showed pictures of various menu items so we could ooh and ahh about what items we would be ordering later.  We ended up waiting less than 20 minutes before our table was ready and we were pleased to see that the 4 of us got a spacious corner booth. All of the staff we encountered were super friendly, smiley, and helpful... And our food was DELICIOUS! We ordered the Steak Diane, Chicken Piccatta, and the Chicken Bellagio.  My 6 year old chose the Fried Chicken Strips with French Fries.  Everything tasted soooo good!  We want to keep coming back so we can try the rest of the menu items (there are SO MANY choices!).

We had dinner there for a special event last night and the entire evening we felt so taken care of. The entire staff went above and beyond to make accommodations for our large party and were incredibly efficient, patient, and understanding of all our needs.  The menu is a bit daunting, but thanks to our amazing servers, Kristyn and Levi, we got through it. Lol. They not only knew almost everything about the menu, they gave us great descriptions of their amazing selection and we ended up ordering all of their recommendations. We were not disappointed! Kristyn was so sweet and attentive all evening with such a pleasant personality and was even apologetic for an error in one of our orders and made up for it with a double portion of one of our side orders. Levi was so passionate about cheesecake he made us want to order every single one! Lol. They made us feel so welcome and definitely were a huge part of making our evening outstanding. Ask to be in their section if you can! Lol.  Because of the crowds, the wait for our food was a little long. However, the manager was kind enough to come out and apologize to us and keep us in the loop as to why we were waiting. Super classy move.  Overall, we love this new restaurant! The atmosphere is a little crowded and loud, but the interior is beautiful. We sat outside and the beautiful ambiance and live music made a perfect evening. The portions were generous and we left so full and happy. Their delicious menu is only topped by their first class customer service.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory!

Tumon B.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",0,7,,4.0,1/6/2018,"Went for an early dinner with off island family and we rated a 4 of 5 stars! Noticeable was two flies that kept flying around. The staff noted the doors were open and they go away towards evening time.  We ordered drinks twice because the first waiter didn't provide refreshments.  The bread was warm and we noticed that we had no utensils on the table. I had to get up and get a few butter knives for kids to eat warm bread with butter. We waited a couple minutes but no waiter around. Finally we ordered and everything else was ok.  I preferred the Waikiki location because they were very busy but very nice and attentive.  After l tipped at 15% we met waited staff on way out but no ""mahalo"" or thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=180

We were in a line for a short period( 5min +-) we were greeted by a staff member who seated us outside. We ordered right away VEGAN food. They recommend veggi burger ( rice, black bean..etc)   An hour later no food. Really? At that point everyone around us had their meals. We were frustrated because 1. we were crunching for time and 2. We had waited so long. We expressed our disappointment in their service. The manager ""Slade "" if I remember correctly was very kind. He apologized for the long wait..... the burger was very delicious. The reasons for the five star review:       1. Clean relaxing environment        2. Great knowledgeable staff/ Slade       3.

The following week, we were in the neighborhood and headed to CF for cheesecake to take out.  The wait time to dine in was a 2 hour wait for lunch.  So it seemed the wait time is still long.  But there's so much stores to check out, that 2 hours seems like 30 minutes.

Came for dinner around 8ish and was told the wait would be 75-90 minutes. Unlike the Waikiki location, the front check-in desk wasn't packed and crowded, and we actually had benches with lots of space inside/outside for customers to wait.  We waited for only an hour until we were called, which is relative to the Waikiki location. Ordered the avocado egg rolls and fried mac n cheese balls, which I get all the time! Delicious! Also got the veggie burger and recess peanut butter cheesecake for dessert. The wait for the food was usual however we did get our complimentary bread awhile after our appetizers.  Our waitress Yanira was AMAZING! She was super sweet and apologetic for our bread taking too long and constantly reassured us that our food is on the way. She even asked us if we wanted to put in our order for our cheesecake early, because the wait for the bakery was 30 min. We ordered our dessert the same time as our entrees and it came out right on time!

Got there by 530 pm, didnt have to wait that long at all, although it was a Monday night. It is my birthday so I expected a wonderful dinner. Ambience was as expected, a little loud but nice. The hostess that seated us had a pleasant face, love the eye contact when greeting us. The waitress had a wonderful smile, great attitude & again eye contact was on point. The menu had lot of options especially their desserts. I had the eggplant parmigiana. First impression? Wow 3 huge pieces. The pesto pasta was just a bit dry, not much flavor, but amount of pasta was just right. Eggplant breading was slightly overcooked but loved it. My hubby had the chicken basil pasta. Portions was spot on, lot of flavor. My daughter had the mushroom burger with sweet potato fries. She love it, couldnt really give a review because all she said was ""it was good mom"".  The hostess came back to check on us, which was awesome.

Today, I went with my family and the wait was an hour but that's normal and actually good considering Cheesecake Factory being busy all the time. The service was great, our waitress, Nicole, was excellent! She didn't forget any of our needs and was nice.

The dip had already gotten cold as well. They need to write something on the ticket that says the customer was a walk-in or give me one of those light alert thingies (idk wtf they're called) so they know the customer is there waiting, which I suggested but doubt they'll do.

When I heard they were opening one in Kapolei I was so excited (to have another so that maybe the wait for either wouldn't be so long) I decided to wait til the ""newness"" of the Kapolei location to die down before heading over. Went on a Thursday around 10pm and yes..no line..we were shown to our table immediately. I love the dim lights and the atmosphere in there. Of course the fresh warm bread is always amazing and instead of my usual pasta, I decided to go with the Parmesan crusted chicken breast with mashed potatoes...AMAZING!!!

He asked if we needed more time to look over drinks, we said no unfortunately to him 10 seconds was not enough for him to wait for our response so he fled to pick up drinks for another table. When we looked up to tell him what we wanted to drink he was gone! So thereafter we asked for a manager, this got worse!! The first manager was rude with attitude off the wide. "" Uh I'm always in the back and I know no one would do anything to your food"" oh really you're ALWAYS in the back watching over. No he was not able to take criticism like a real manager and deliver customer service. Bunch of back n forth, then we were seated in a different section  for a different server. Things looked better however my wife was very offended by our first server n manager. Kapolei cheesecake is 90% local not like Waikiki where it's 90% tourist.

I have to admit when i read somewhere about the health code violation i stayed away for a good amount of time until i thought it was safe to give this place a try. I went on a busy night so the place was packed. The wait wasn't too long and it gave me time to shop around. For drinks my girlfriend got a mojito and i got the flying gorilla (adult version of a banana shake). Our waiter recommended the mac & cheese burger so i got that and my girlfriend had this spicy chicken pasta dish. The only thing that makes me take away a star is that the burger was only decent for the price i paid for it, will try a pasta next visit. Be warned, stuff here isn't cheap so just keep that in mind.

kristen n.,"Aiea, HI",30,42,1,1.0,10/15/2017,"This was probably the worse dining experience I've had in awhile, so strap in for a long read. We pull up at 1030 and are supervisors there is already a long line. We figure, hey, it's popular we just have to wait. We stand in line for five minutes and the line is not moving at all. My husband even checks to see if they are open. They are, they have 2 hostesses literally holding the doors open and four more behind the desk but no one is moving. We figure it busy, and just wait. We finally are being seated and floor manage walks up to one the door hostesses and signals to let us in. She then says, ""this group, then wait a bit.""  Wait... are they artificially keeping people waiting to make it look popular? Because there are empty seats everywhere and three hostesses just standing around and an entire lanai section open. Maybe they really are crowded and have tons of tables ready to be bussed? Nope, 4 empty tables in our section 2 of which were not filled too we about left. We order and the waitress has to come back not once, not twice, but three times! She forgot to ask if we wanted fries versus salad. Then she forgot to ask if we wanted a drink, then she forgot what I ordered off the keiki menu. It did seem to enlongate our wait time as we saw people who sat the same time as us get our food. It's a bit of a wait so I excuse myself to the bathroom. When I come back, my food is leaving the table... wait, what?  The waitress reports that the hollandaise sauce I ordered on the side was poured over everything and would have to be sent back. Well, at least she caught it? A manager rolls up, since it was an error on the kitchens part. She then just says, ""so you don't liekholaidaise eauce? I get it, it can be an overwhelming taste."" Um, okay? I acknowledge I don't like large amounts of it, but I reported this when I first ordered. The manager made it seem like I tasted it and sent it back. No, I told them not to put any on, and the kitchen made the error. WTF? I just didn't want to deal with this so I told her, ""okay."" And she walked away. I had already resolved never to come again. But it could've been partially forgiven if the food was even good, but this was worse than chicken and waffle BLD in Aiea. The waffle really mushy and there was a big chunk of unmixed batter in one, The fried chicken or really just chicken tenders, and their maple syrup with butter tasted like crap. To add to the insult it took five minutes just to get her check and while I was waiting for the check a hostess asked if she could take an unused chair for my table.  I agreed, and when she pulled the chair out, it got stuck in the table and a bunch of utensils fell on the floor.

Kryssy T.,"Waipahu, HI",0,14,3,5.0,9/28/2017,"I visited on September 28, 2017 right at opening. My party and I actually showed up an hour early (10:30a) to wait in line because we've been seeing reviews and heard from friends that a line forms pretty early. When we got there at 10:30a there was no one there so we just waited in line. By the time 11:00a rolled around the line was starting to wrap around the building. In any case, we were seated right away when they opened at 11:30a.  Our server, Kelly, was amazing! She was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The manager even came around to our table to check on us (she was going around to all the tables), which was nice. You can tell that this Cheesecake Factory location took the time to really train their staff. Everyone provided such great service which is rare considering they just opened last week. I usually like to wait a little before going to a new restaurant to let them work out their kinks (i.e. Poorly trained staff, food not being cooked right, etc), but this Cheesecake Factory location seems to have their stuff together from the get go.  For the food review, I ordered an avocado toast and Caesar salad. Let me just say, I highly recommend the avocado toast! It was soooo good (and slightly messy). The Caesar salad portion was HUGE! Had I known the portion size was so big I would've ordered something else. It still tasted good so that's all that matters. For dessert I had the celebration cheesecake which was like a funfetti cake with chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla mousse w/ cheesecake on top (soooo good!).  Overall I'll definitely be back at this location.

Claudia M.,"Kapolei, HI",0,9,,4.0,10/11/2017,"My sister-in-law and I went for brunch, which they serve one Saturdays and Sundays. It took us 3 hours to eat. Wait time for a table was 30-45 minutes. They're literally /always/ busy, so no matter what time of day, there is going to be a wait time. :-) The food took a little while to come out, but it's understandable because they're a new restaurant and there's bound to be kinks to work out.  There's a lot of options on the menu to choose from. I ordered some sort of pasta (this was a week ago, so I don't remember), the spinach and cheese dip with chips, and the stuffed mushrooms. The spinach dip wasn't that great, in my opinion. There wasn't a whole lot of cheese in it, so it mostly just tasted like spinach. I order spinach and artichoke dip literally everywhere, so it fell flat for me. However, the stuffed mushrooms were absolutely delicious! I'm in love with them, and will probably order 4 orders of them next time I go here. At the beginning of our meal, we told our waitress that we were going to order some eggs benedict for my brother. We reminded her mid-meal about it, and expected it to be out when we were finished. However, something went wrong (either their waffle maker broke, or they made the hollandaise sauce wrong and had to remake it. We were given two explanations haha), so we waited almost 40 minutes for it post-meal. What was nice though was that manangers were present on the floor to apologize for the wait times. He explained to us what happened, and even though it wasn't necessary, he took the eggs benedict off of our bill to compensate for the wait :-) I thought that was nice. Overall, I enjoyed my visit. I will probably come again when things die down a little more, especially for those stuffed mushrooms. *A*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=220

So we spent a total of 4 hours there mostly waiting. That's way to long especially if you have hungry kids. Not sure what the hype is about this place it's ok but not worth wasting 4 hours for.

Followed to host back to our table but someone else had decided to switch tables so we were offered a different one but it was small and really close to another Party so we said we would wait a few mins for another booth to be cleaned. After about 5 mins or so we were led to the booth and given the extremely extensive menu... (largest menu of any ckf) looked over it a while while waiting for the waitress. We did wait longer than usual for the waitress to greet us, but its a very large resturant so i understood. I ordered the chicken pot pie and my husband ordered a salad... i cant remember the name but it came with 2 colored beats and he liked it. A different waiter brought out my husbands salad and informed us they were out of something for the chicken pot pie which was disappointing that they let us know after bringing my husbands meal.. but i ordered the shepherds pie instead. Our waitress,  Stephanie came to check on us and was upset that they waited so long to tell us about my meal so she got a manager who came over soon after and appologized, was very nice and got me a salad on the house while i waited. Come to find out the chef was able to make the chicken pot pie so they asked if i still wanted that and i did so they brought it out maybe 1 min later. Everyone was very nice and apologetic about the mishap so i wasnt too upset especially knowing the chef was able to figure it out after initially thinking they couldnt do it. The pot pie was so good when it came out too!  Also there was a leak coming from the roof since it had been raining all day, but we were informed about it before sitting down which was nice, and we didnt mind. Stuff happens!  We also ordered a dulce de leche cheesecake to go which was amazing!! Overall i was very pleased with the politeness of all of the staff and eagerness to fix our situations for us.

Li B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/27/2017,"My fiancé and I just had dinner here (Dec 27th around 4:30) and were disappointed with our first visit. It was 15 minutes for water and the server dropped our bread basket all on the table and didn't try to clean it so I did, which is fine since the place seemed kind of hectic at the time we went, so no big issue. But our server basically disappeared because two different servers came to bring us our food and didn't check in. Which our food didn't seem too appetizing since it looked like presentation wasn't a big deal. Our food looked tossed onto the plate like you'd receive at a cafeteria during school mixed with a ton of black pepper and it was extremely oily. Our server did a 'walk by check' twice, which I call when you walk quickly by and ask the question but not fully ask it and have us the customers not even say a word to you before you go on and disappear again. After a while we just stopped eating and she quickly took our plates to disappear again. We even got dessert after our entrees from a different server. The bill was something interesting as well. We gave her our gift card and cash to pay but she threw away the original copy in this process somehow and gave us a different copy of the receipt which had some scribbles on it. But we didn't receive our change! I mean I would think we would get change back but she quickly said ""here's your copy of the receipt. I threw away the original on accident so we had to reprint it. You guys have a good holiday"" and walked away quickly. My fiancé and I were kinda of confused since that happened fast. So we left pretty irritated that service could have been better and mainly how a server automatically thought to keep our change as tip. We didn't even know what our change was.

To the person seating us down, to both of the servers that took care of us yesterday was amazing.  Refilling drinks, checking on how the food was, to refilling bread without even really asking.

Emilee P.,"Kapolei, HI",17,26,20,4.0,9/19/2017,"Yes, we braved opening day. It was not as bad as I was expecting. They seemed to really have things working smoothly because they have so many trainers and more experienced staff on hand to oversee everything. We sat outside because we didn't want to wait an extra 45 min for an inside table. During the day it is HOT so we will definitely wait for an inside spot next time. My one issue was actually with one of the managers (maybe? a woman walking around not in uniform but overseeing things). I have been ordering the same dish from the Cheesecake Factory in different locations for at least 10 years- Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Being pregnant I was seriously craving this dish. What we got looked nothing like what I have always received in other locations. It was tomato based and not at all creamy. You can see the photos of the regular dish on the Waikiki page, and the menu even states ""Honey Glazed Chicken, Asparagus, Red and Yellow Peppers, Peas, Garlic and Onion in a Spicy Chipotle Parmesan CREAM Sauce"". So we asked this manager (because she was walking around our area) if something had changed with the dish or if we got the wrong one by mistake because it did not look or taste the same. She just laughed and said no, that is the same it's always been, and ""she would know"". We weren't happy with the dish and instead of wanting to fix the problem or offer something else she just dismissed us. I thought that was sort of rude. Besides that encounter, all the other staff were great. We got our cheesecakes to go because you get stuffed on the bread and appetizers alone. Overall, happy to have a location now on the Westside. If you don't want to brave a crowd just order takeout or go up to the cheesecake counter and get a slice to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=260

I called in my order for curb side pick up and was on hold on the phone for 20 minutes... I hung up and called back, placed my order and when I arrived to pick up my order all of the order parking spots were taken and nobody was picking up the curbside pick up phone line... so after waiting while calling for 10 minutes I decided to go inside to pick up my order... I was in line for about 15 minutes... fortunately as soon as I got to the register my order was already there so I didn't have to wait longer.  The only great thing about this new location is free parking!! Other than that this place is just as hectic as the Waikiki spot.

You would think the manager would comp my meal or offer a slice of cheesecake for the inconvenience.  Nope. Never saw her again. I understand the restaurant is fairly new, but our server would get lost at times when we requested extra salad dressing or bread.

Monica K.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,8,12,4.0,10/4/2017,"Waited a little after the grand opening before checking them out. I've eaten at the Waikiki location ONCE because I'm not into waiting an hour or more for a table. This new location was pretty good. Got lucky with a table for two upon entering in the bar seating. Huge menu so allow yourself a good ten minutes to look it over. Service is relatively quick as they are well-staffed, always a plus. Started with a refreshing cucumber mojito and a strong blood orange margarita. We got the Fettucine Alfredo with chicken and Cajun Jambalaya pasta with shrimp and chicken for our entrees. I got a lot of juicy bite-sized pieces of chicken, but maybe only 3 small pieces of shrimp lol but it was still pretty tasty with a decent amount of spice. Alfredo was creamy but could've used more cheese in the sauce to give it more body. But like I said, still very tasty. Finished our dinner with a slice of the white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake.

The food was awesome, the Chicken Madeira has always been one of my favorite dishes there. The only down side was that the kids food was the last to come out, and for a hungry child, that may be a problem.

Roxy G.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,1,1,5.0,10/10/2017,"I actually live in Orlando, FL, but I wanted to give this review because I experienced fantastic customer service from this restaurant. Here me out. My boyfriend and his family went to eat at Cheesecake Factory in Kapolei since it's new in town they were celebrating his birthday. I unfortunately live 4,000 miles away but I wanted to see if I could surprise him with a cheesecake paid by me with a note on the plate. After contacting them, Raina Jones, who works as a host, TOTALLY went above and BEYOND to make this surprise work!! She did all she could to deliver the message to the servers and made sure that cheesecake was sent to my boyfriend's table. Jaylyn Garces, the other host working that night, also helped with the process, so I applaud and thank these two for doing their job flawlessly. It's hard being a host so I'm extremely happy that they did what they could, despite the busy crowds, to make this surprise happen. If you decide to stop by CF in Kapolei and run into these ladies, tell them how great they are for me!! And managers, if you are reading this, give these ladies a raise!! Side note: I ordered the S'mores Cheesecake for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it!

Couldn't even melt the butter in it. My friend ordered a mushroom burger medium rare but it was too rare. As Gordon Ramsay would say ""I could still hear the cow mooing"". I ordered my burger medium rare and it came well done. Very dry. My friend that ordered chicken in a biscuit described it as looking like a TV dinner.

My lady ordered the this 'Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken' and it was to die for. Food came out at a decent time, but was worth the small wait because the taste was wonderful! Plates are little more on pricey side but still reasonable. We ordered a Dulce de Leche cheesecake, but it took them about 20 mins to let us know they didn't have the flavor . So we got Godiva instead. But they also came out with a Dulce de Leche, which they claimed was the very last one and because of all that, it was complimentary!!! Woohoo, can't be hangry bout that. Of course, the cakes were to die for. So overall, the experience was great even if the feelz was all about crowds and waiting. If you can wait, give it several weeks for the lines to taper off.

I know they get busy on weekends, especially Friday nights but our server was just all over the place and took too long to close out our table. We waited for a good 30 minutes for water refills because every time we asked she or another server would say okay, but forget.

Our waitress was nice and friendly and was very patient. Now comes the negatives. We were a party of four and our water and drinks alone took over 10 minutes to get to us, including bread. The appetizers we ordered were the avocado egg rolls and as always it was superb, but also 15-20 minutes to arrive. Within the time, getting another round of drinks was 15 minutes on its own. One whole hour after all this the food had finally arrived, and it was wrong and still had to wait for certain things to complete it.

Spearfactor S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,10,33,1.0,9/22/2017,"I get that this location has only been open officially for 5 days and yes there was like 80 people waiting 2hrs to be seated on a Thursday evening because the restaurant is packed, but your customers choose to call-in pickup order for the convenience of not having to wait.  Is there a way to give negative stars? So last night (Thursday) I'm at the Kai Makana Alii mall at 7pm for a meeting with friends.  I get a call from the wife at home asking if I can pickup cheesecake for dessert to bring home.  I expected a long wait for even a phone order so I wasn't surprised when I was told my order (3 slices of cheesecake) would take 20 minutes to be ready.  I give it 40 minutes cause they are busy and show up at the pickup counter.  How long can it take to pack up 3 slices of cheesecake right?  Not like they have to bake it from scratch, right?  The pickup counter is at the front of the restaurant behind the cheesecake display counter.  Orders are received in the back of restaurant and the order is supposed to be relayed to the front of the restaurant where they pack any cheesecakes in the order.  Behind the cheesecake counter are 10 busy workers (I counted them).  I wave one down to get her attention and tell her I am here to pickup my phone order.  She asks my name which I give her and 20 minutes later she goes through the stack of receipts in front of her.  About this time she  starts to get this ""somethings' wrong"" look on her face so she asks me my phone number and my order which she walkie-talkies to the back room where orders are taken.  She tells me to please hold on while they check in the back.  15 minutes later she gets a call from the back and they can't find my order.  By now I've been waiting 1hr 15 min (40 min waiting outside + 35 min inside) for 3 slices of cheesecake.  So I ask the worker who is helping me if she can just pack my order from the slices that are in the showcase in front of her, which she just laughs at my comment (WTH is that about?).  Apparently the cakes are ONLY for in-store customers and I ask if she can go get my 3 slices of cheesecake from the back.  Her reply was ""I cannot leave my post"", glad she is a good soldier and defending the cheesecake with her life but common.  15 min later she asks if I want to place my order again to which I ask how long will that take?  30 minutes was the reply.  So I've been waiting now 1.5hrs and you want me to wait another 30 minutes to get my order that should have been ready 1hr 40min ago?   I would have been willing to let this slide without a review if not for 2 things:  1) I was not once offered an apology, not by the worker or by the manager.  Instead I was asked to step aside and ignored as other customers who walked in the door off the street were helped to a cheesecake order.  I discovered this by asking one of the customers how long ago they called in their order to which the reply was we didn't call in.  They literally just walked up to the counter and was walking out the door with cheesecake without any wait whatsoever. 2) I asked if my order could just be pulled from the showcase but because I made it over the phone I am somehow prohibited from ordering from the front. So because I ordered over the phone I have to wait 2 hours for 3 slices of cheesecake but if I walked in and placed my order I wouldn't have to wait?  UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!  Your customer's time is just as valuable as your workers.  Yes, its a new restaurant in a part of the island that is not used to getting new restaurants so of course its gonna be busy and I get that.  I just pointed out a huge problem with your process.  You are WELCOME! I think I will just buy my cheesecake from Costco from now on.  Cheaper and no wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=340
Karly A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,3,,3.0,11/7/2017,"Me and my boyfriend went to this Cheesecake Factory and my first time there was very unsatisfactory. The quality of the food was poorly made. Me and my boyfriend got pasta dishes and both dishes were served cold. Even though the wait was short, the food was not up to standards. I would rather have a longer wait with good quality food then a shorter wait, with the food looked being rushed out of the kitchen. When we told the waitresses there, they didn't do much to compensate with us. Although they did bring out our dishes again, but by then we were already full from the precious dishes that we tried eating. The waitresses were very nice though but can always be improved! The only good part was the cheesecake honesty but that's not hard to mess up since you just put it on the plate and serve it. I think that this place definitely wasn't worth all the hype that people were giving credit for. Honestly, I will resort to going to the Waikiki location for better quality food as well as service. There is always room for improvement though being a new location I wouldn't rate this so harsh.

Had my first chance to eat there the other night after a long day of work and homework.  The ambiance was good, they had live music playing although the first thing you notice is that its loud. It over powered the dinner date conversation. Almost as if theres a concert in the resturant.  The service lacked a ""customer first"" experience for one reason only. I ordered a drink and asked that rum be replaced by vodka. I was told it was impossible to do because the bartenders cannot break thier recipes. I've been to countless Cheesecake Factory competitors and never been denied a similar request at any of them.Ever! The impression I got from that encounter was Cheesecake factory will dictate thier service to their customers and refuse flexibility at all costs. Also the impression I got was the bartenders are rookies, the drinks were pre made stored under the counter, poured over ice served with a garnish and I would be charged $$$.  Its a simple fix that involves a customer first mentality, flexibility and a knowledgeable bartender.

The Kapolei location is terrible when it comes to organization. I came here with my husband and toddler on October 22, 2017 and arrived at 4:52 pm. We requested indoor seating, which the hostess told us it would be a 55-70 minute wait. We went and walked around the mall until then. When we returned an hour later, we checked with the hostess to see how much longer our wait would be which she said the we would wait the full 70 minutes  unless we wanted whatever option available (indoor or outside). We said outside would be fine also. 70 minutes passes and still nothing. We ask what the hold up and we are only told that it's busy. At 6:30pm we are told there is 1 other party ahead of us and they were waiting for others to do finish their desserts. We were waiting by the hostess table and they sat 5 other parties and we were still waiting. To add insult the hostess suggested that we sit at one of the open high tables near the bar with our 2 year old. No a high chair wouldn't even reach the table, so why ask. After many complaints, we are finally seated at 7:02pm. My son is already tired from the wait and barely ate.  They bring us to the table which was not even cleared yet so we stood by waiting for the bus boy to clean it. He forgot to give us napkins. The server came by about 10 minutes later to start with our drinks. We placed our full order then and I asked for napkins. The server comes back with 2 napkins for our party of 3. Obviously my done doesn't count, because toddlers who orders spaghetti isn't messy. Our food comes out pretty fast and it was good (My 1 star). I had a lot left over so I asked for to go boxes. He brings out two small to go boxes. I ask for another one since my food obviously would fit in their cheesecake Togo box. The server comes back with another small Togo box and I ask if they had bigger ones. He said yes, but they were thinner, I asked for it anyway. My food fit perfectly in the big one but he wanted me to squeeze just my entree in 3 little ones.     The only staff that did their jobs correctly were the cooks, the rest needs work. The hostess shouldn't be there. She doesn't know what she's doing. I've never experienced a wait like that in Waikiki which is always crowded.

Our food comes out last and it was terrible. The adult food was over cooked, dry, and mediocre. We expressed our dissatisfaction with the manager JT(or something similar). He took the food charge off. We also ordered Cheesecake to go. When I got home the wrong Cheesecake was in the bag. I called and had to make another trip there to get the correct one. I tipped the waitress out of the kindness of my heart but honestly I felt that the service was so poor no tip was needed. It was also my mothers birthday. No one sung happy birthday nor was it acknowledged. I am completely happy to wait for acceptable service. I'll skip this location and eat at Waikiki. At least the wait will be worth it.

We got 2 appetizers, the Parmesan garlic cheese bread was delicious but the fried calamari was ok the meat on it was minimal I've had better calamari at other restaurants. I was really disappointed with how I could barely taste the calamari mostly the breading they used was on the plate. Waiting for our food was a long wait though which we didn't mind they were busy.  My other half got a shrimp pasta and he loved it and I got the steak Diane yummy although we were stuffed already from waiting so long and eating all of our appetizers and the bread they served lol we had to take it to go. I wanted to try the Godiva cheesecake but the wait for it was going to be 20min. I suggest putting it in during your meal order if you know what dessert you want. I waited till the end, and didn't want to wait anymore we were there for to long waiting on our dinner.  The reason why I gave it a 3 star was because of the spoon on our table, it was filthy. It wasn't hard to see at all it had black and green residue on it. Clearly it wasn't cleaned good at all, I had to check our forks to make sure those were clean. Sure I wasn't going to use the spoon but that was just disgusting, it happens I guess and they were super busy. Not sure what they use to wash their dishes and utensils but it should be checked before placing on their tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=340
A L.,"Kapolei, HI",50,2,,1.0,9/29/2017,"While long wait it is understood.  The quality of the food and service was less than desirable.  We order 1 order of mac cheese balls and crab/spinach dip, after 10min of our appetizer order being placed, we have a gentleman come to our table to tell us they ran out of crab/spinach dip, we order another order of mac cheese balls.  Thinking we will get them together, no, our appeatizers were brought out apprx 20min apart each.  My husband orders the meatloaf.  Again 15-20 min later waitress comes back to tell us they ran out of meatloaf, he orders the cheese steak sandwich with a salad. 30 min later, dinner plates are brought out/served individually each apprx 15min apart and not together, with my 6yr old  getting his dinner at last! My husbands dinner was less than desirable served with fries vs salad, to which waitress takes fries back and another 10min later comes back with salad.  The bread on sandwich was as hard as a rock, barely could bite, he opted to just eat the meat!  We were a party of 5! after 2+ hrs of sitting there just waiting for our food (not counting the 70min wait, understood) we opted to just to go boxes and eat at home next day! We were there to celebrate a birthday, however not much of celebration after not being able to eat together as a party of 5! Also survey link on receipt does not work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=340
Likeke L.,"Waianae, HI",48,6,23,2.0,9/24/2017,"We absolutely love the CCF in town, but being on the west side, we hardly get a chance to eat there. We were ecstatic when we heard one was opening in kapolei. First time here tonight. Told the wait was going to 25 minutes, but we were seated in 5. We had high hopes. We got there after 10pm. We asked the server for water with lemon and some straws. She came back with water and bread, but no straws or lemons. We put our order in for both apps and entree and don't see her again for 30 minutes. Someone else brings our apps. By this time our water is all gone. Waitress comes back gives us more bread but doesn't fill up the water. Another waitress came by and gave us our entrées. Our regular waitress then shows up and asks us if we wanted Parmesan cheese on our pasta. She then left to get the cheese but didn't come back to fill up our water. We had to ask her for this. After we started dating I started noticing something strange about my dish. There were huge pieces of chard food in my dish...all I could taste was ashes. Spoke to the manager, he made them remake my dish and then he gave me a free slice of cheesecake. Asked the waitress for more water after we finished our dessert...she only filled up my husband's cup and left mine empty. We left close to 1am...almost 3 hours after we arrived, all because we had to wait for something that should've been given, (water) or at least done correctly the first time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=340
T L.,"Kapolei, HI",0,47,2,4.0,9/25/2017,"Ok, food great! Dessert! Great! Wait time, to be expected. If you come in with a party of more than 4 than expect to wait awhile. On Sunday 9.24.17 at 5pm, it was jammed pack. New hot spot of course everybody is going to be there. We were told a 4 hour wait for a party of 8. So I opted to split my party to 2 tables of 4. Didn't have to be together just get us in. I was told 75minutes. Well, it took 120 minutes. I checked every half hour to make sure we weren't skipped or forgotten. I didn't trip because I expected it to be crazy. We wait in Waikiki for 2 hours ez. So, we waited. We managed to get patio seating at 7pm and lucked out and got 2 tables side my side. Winning!!!! Yah, they need to work the kinks out  but overall.still a great meal and sit on the patio after 7. It's awesome! Kapolei nite life is beautiful. And not noisy like inside n crowded.  Cheesecake Factory still good food and service. Just make sure you keep checking the status of your seating. It's crazy busy but they really tried tonite to get us in. But worth the wait for a great meal and good service. Try the Chicken Bellagio. Awesome dish. A bit of everything on one plate. The banana cream pie cheese cake wasn't bad either. Kalua nachos a winner but tell them to make sure they put plenty of Kalua pork on there.  People not local made bad reviews they were discriminated against because they were overlooked when it came to seating. Well, with a new joint, new staff, and an influx of people. Bound to be mistakes made. But those who not from here want to play the race card. Let me say this, discrimination is everywhere. I'm Hawaiian. Born n raised here but travel ed half way around the world, lived in Japan, lived in Chicago for 10 years, Arizona for 4. I was a military wife for 8 years. A wife of a police officer for almost 20 years. Human error does exist. I've had it done to me while waiting at CPK in Kapolei. Told they called me. And they didn't. I was sitting right in front of the host. She either forgot or bypassed me. She was white and lied to my face with a surprised look on her face. Like she forgot. But I didn't play the race card cuz she forgot. I just thought what an airhead, young, n not focused. Then I kept it moving. People make mistakes n will lie to cover it up. It's not called discrimination it's called human nature. Lord knows, I've seen discrimination at its ugliest. Lucky to live Hawaii!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=340

Andy N.,"Aiea, HI",0,11,3,4.0,10/11/2017,"Came here 10/7/17 with the Family around 530pm to try beat the dinner rush recommended by other yelpers. Quoted wait time was 50mins, which we didn't mind for a newly open spot. We walked around the corner to the arcade in J. Rockets for the kids to play while we wait. Before we could even purchase a game card our buzzer buzzed. 12 min wait time, no complaints. We sat on the right side. Seats and table were comfortably space and not to cramp.  Our server greeted us immediately and got our drink order promptly. My infant knock a fork on the floor and before we could ask for another one one of the staff members replace it. Good Team work. I order the Macaroni Burger Delicious. and Mrs order a salad, crab balls; made with real crab and we shared a Spinach Dip... Everthing was delicious. Now For why they got minus one star. the food took over 50 mins to arrive and they forgot my order of sweet potatoes fries I order with my burger. To mitigate server brought concern to manager and they didnt charge us for the fries and gave us a free cheesecake. Yay...if they can work on kitchen time and food running they have a 5 Star Spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=340

The honey bourbon martini was awesome. Our server was very knowledgeable, honest, and hospitable. Kelli gave her honest thoughts on the food that we ordered and was spot on with everything! If the service and food quality remains the same as tonight, I will be coming back over and over again.

It tasted like plastic! There were no condiments in there. Also, the lunch pasta, tasted like those cheap helpers pasta that you could buy at Walmart.  I think this place should just sell cheesecake desserts and not on trays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=280
Ms LaLa D.,"Honolulu, HI",0,74,116,5.0,10/7/2017,"First time here and I will definitely be back!! I met my girlfriends for lunch at 11:00 on a Tuesday. Although they didn't open until 11:30 thank goodness my friends were there early at 11:00 not knowing they open later. As I was walking towards the restaurant I notice a very long line along the sidewalk leading to the door. Thinking it was a contest or something free I asked one of the Staff on the outside lanai what the line was for? About 50-60 were in line to be seated. I knew Waikiki was know to be busy and could have a 30-60 minute wait at times but I never thought early on a weekday would the place have a line. But that just goes to tell you how popular and delicious the selections are. I've loved Cheesecake Factory ever since my first experienced while in Southern California over 20 years ago. Like I said luckily my girlfriends arrived early and had been one of the first to be seated after being in the front of that line. We had a window booth for 4. My girlfriends had already ordered the egg roll sampler with a variety of rolls and sauces. Our server Lori who was wonderful noticed I had joined them and came by to greet me and take my beverage order. The girls were drinking tropical tea and she suggested the same for me since I asked for iced tea. It was delicious and refreshing. After indulging in our appetizers and looking over all the yummy selections we were ready to order. My friends ordered the Marsala chicken, spicy cashew chicken and since we all wanted to share and try each other's lunches our server Lori suggested the Bistro Pasta which was amazing!! Thank you Lori! She reminded us to save room for the outstanding cheesecakes. After all we were at ""Cheesecake"" Factory, lol! Lori brought us smaller shareable plates and we all enjoyed trying each other's lunch selections. We decided we were content and asked for doggy bags, which I don't know why we call it that since most dogs don't get to eat the leftovers, right?! Lori our server graciously boxed all of our food and packed it individually for us to take with us. While resting our tummies and looking at all the different Cheesecakes they have to offer one of the Hostess Tihani was making her rounds picking up menus and checking on customers. We had the pleasure of getting to know a little bit more about the establishment and what they have to offer other than lunch time. Just like our server Lori, Tihani was very very pleasant. So we still needed to decide about dessert. Although we were content we didn't want to leave w/o trying at least one flavor of cheesecake. So we asked for suggestions. Lori recommended Dolce which we did ordered. Another server came by and mentioned that was one of his favorites. After tasting it we knew why it was suggested. It was delicious!! We sat and shared the piece and caught up with each others lives. We didn't feel rushed or pressed to order or leave. Once we were ready to settle our bill, we asked if we could pay individually. Lori was happy to separate our checks. We really appreciated it. Lori gave us a wonderful experience and Tihani was so nice to take the time in checking on us and explaining the restaurant details. I can't wait for the next time I have the opportunity to go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=280

We expected to wait 1-1 1/2 hrs, but It was the malls anniversary and the average wait time to be seated for 6 or more people was 3 hrs.  At the 3 hr mark, when we asked if we will be seated (we were 8), the hostess replied that it will be another hour.  After hearing this, I asked for a manager. ANNIE was quick, professional and happy to get us seated right away within 5 mins!   Our server, TARONA was the bomb!!!!  She first apologized for the long wait then took our order patiently and answered all of our 20 questions about the menu. She was quick to get our water and bread out while we waited again for our food. She was awesome in coming back and forth to check if we needed anything, how our food tasted and if we needed refills on our drinks. Although I will never wait for 3 hrs to eat again, Manager Annie and Tarona made our first experience at Kapolei Cheesecake Factory a good one!!!  5 Stars on both of your customer service!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=280

Seven groups went in and when I ask why we haven't been seated yet walked in after me and were seated. I asked the girl at the front why were we still waiting while other groups after me was being seated? the girl tells me that they're buzzing me now. I told the girl that they already buzzed me and I gave it to her and her response was oh  Waited on the side again just to watch 5 more groups get seated.

(lol) the food as ok I ordered blue hawaii for my drink, there's actually an aftertaste of an old pineapple;( then my jambalaya pasta ok not the best though pasta was over cooked and there was too much bell peppers.. didn't try any desserts though coz I was disappointed w my food, I had like 3 bites that was it.. my advice if the wait time is about more than an hour don't waste your time..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-kapolei?start=280

Although they should have worked out the kinks in service and getting food out in a timely matter. First off, when coming in I was greeted right away, then was given a wait time of 30 minutes (not a problem) it was then that my buzzer went off and when we got in we waited another 15 minutes inside to get seated. You would think when the buzzer goes off thy would be ready to seat you. Our waitress was able to get our order in no time that was great. Kids food came out first thank goodness! Then the sitting around for 40 minutes just for our meal, mind you no apps were ordered. Wish my experience was better my kids were restless waiting for us to receive our food and eat.
