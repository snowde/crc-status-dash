Marqueta L.,"Ooltewah, TN",5,13,,4.0,11/26/2017,Dropped in for a late lunch on Black Friday. Our party did not have to wait very long to be seated which was a surprise on such a busy shopping day. The service was great and the food was awesome as always! We tried a couple of slices of cheesecake and they were amazing as expected. Great place for a great meal!

Canny F.,"Knoxville, TN",591,1444,5771,2.0,3/10/2017,"I had a feeling I wouldn't like it.  Huge menu. They basically make every cuisine. I'm generally not a fan of restaurants that can make everything because that means they don't make it great. Let's say you have a specific problem, do you want to be seen by a specialist or a general practitioner? Yes, the general practitioner can help you but their skills are limited since they need to know everything in general instead of in detail. If you are going to spend money and consume calories, don't waste a meal - go get the real deal.  My study buddy was craving cheesecake one night while studying and arrived 30 minutes before closing. She ordered 2 types of cheesecakes so I was able to try the nutella cheesecake. I also had the strawberry cheesecake from my neighbor. From both experiences, consumed on different days, I felt like I was eating mouse. What's the deal with the texture? If you are a fan of less dense cheesecakes, I recommend coming here. They have an extensive list of cheesecake flavors. Not sure why you would come here for anything else besides cheesecakes but that's just me being judgy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-knoxville
Bernard M.,"Knoxville, TN",3,27,,3.0,12/11/2017,"Ordered lunch special of French onion soup, Caesar salad, and 1/2 chicken salad sammich. The soup was pedestrian, prepared with not much TLC. Salad was fine, but underdressed. SAMMICH WAS, high, FUNNY. I'd say maybe a QUARTER CUP of salad was placed on bread. Check out the pic.

Kayla E.,"Bristol, TN",130,6,4,5.0,10/19/2017,I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory! Every time my husband and I are in Knoxville this is where we eat! The customer service is always on point! The food is always hot and fresh and tastes wonderful!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-knoxville
Kelsey S.,"Knoxville, TN",21,86,117,5.0,9/2/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places in terms of dessert (obviously, who doesn't love some good cheesecake).  I tend to get a bit overwhelmed by their massive menu, but I stepped outside of my normal orange chicken comfort zone and got the bang bang chicken and shrimp on the last visit.   I love Indian, Thai, Japanese, Chinese foods and this was like the perfect blend of some Thai and Indian flavors.  There were nice curry flavors, a slight kick of chile, and a sweet bite from coconut.  The chicken was incredibly juicy and had soaked up all the flavor of the sauce.  The shrimp was the same and mixing it all with the huge pile of white rice was the perfect bite.  For dessert, we tried the new cheesecake flavor they've added to the menu.  I'm Nutella's biggest fan, so when I see they've got a chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake, topped with Nutella, there's no way I'm turning it down.  The ""crust"" is a blondie (stop right there and wipe the drool before I continue) and it has a hazelnut crunch layer on top of it before starting the swirled chocolate hazelnut cheesecake that makes the whole thing worth it.  Add the drizzle of Nutella on top and get a dollop of whipped cream in each bite, and you're on cloud nine of cheesecake heaven.  We had good service to boot, which makes this visit an easy 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-knoxville
Laura H.,"Austin, TX",96,104,167,3.0,3/11/2017,I was not impressed with our waitress. She barely came around. We got an appetizer of chips & spinach artichoke dip.

JC B.,"Memphis, TN",0,3,,2.0,11/3/2017,I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory and I'll I've heard was good things about it. I was sadly let down with the service and quality of food. I had somewhere to be after when I ate and I asked for a club sandwich. It took the waitress about 30 minutes to tell me that they did not have turkey for the sandwich and I had to pick something else. I then got a blt and the bread on it about sliced my mouth open it was so dry and hard (and I know it isn't supposed to be soft).

Michael C.,"Knoxville, TN",0,4,1,1.0,10/14/2017,"Cheesecake Factory- I am normally thrilled with the food and the service. I took my son there earlier this week. His dish was cold and his rice was crunchy. Maybe I expected too much. They replaced his meal but still charged full price for his meal. I expected them to comp his meal. (The first meal was comped but the second meal was charged in full.) I filled out the survey and got a call from their management. I was told they followed their policy. At a nice restaurant you pay for service and good food. This time it did not happen. I at least expected some discount or something. It will be a WHILE before they get more of my money. If you have money to spend and don't mind cold food that you wait for, go for this location. If not, pick somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-knoxville
Jeff L.,"Knoxville, TN",113,9,1,2.0,9/11/2017,Very disappointing experience. This place is pricey and our food was below average to say the least. The waitress recommended loaded tater tot's and they tasted like crap.  Then we got fish tacos with black beans and rice.  The rice and beans were undercooked and cold. The tacos were decent. But for $15 he would definitely expect more. We did have a cheeseburger connoisseur with us and she was disappointed as well. We did complain about the cold rice and beans in the waitress was nice and gave us a free piece of cheese cake which definitely save the day. Very surprised there was a 15 minute wait to get in there. I know the cheesecake is good but seriously!??!?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-knoxville

Robin B.,"Vonore, TN",1,15,,2.0,5/28/2016,"Glad I received a gift card so I could try this place because I'll never go back on my dime.  I can't complain about the wait because we went at 5:30 and only had to wait 10 min.  Hostess could have been friendlier.  The atmosphere is loud and crowded.  Tables so close together,  the waiter for my neighboring table had his ass in  my face three times.  Our waiter had a fake rehearsed manner about him. I'm sure due to his training.  I'd rather see his real personality. Utensils were laying directly on the table,  not a napkin so that grossed me out.  The prices are OUTRAGEOUS but what makes it worse is the food is mediocre. I'm willing to pay if the food is good.  My company ordered the beer battered French fries.  They looked nothing like the picture.  More like nuggets.  When you bit into them it was mushy like mashed potatoes and they were bland.  All you can taste is the grease.  I ordered a simple BBQ bacon cheeseburger for just under $14. Ridiculous! The flavor was good but it was small and the regular fries they offer are meh. I followed the advice of someone else who reviewed this place and asked how much a mojito would be because they do not list any drink prices.  The waiter said around $10.00. I about fell out of my seat.  My birthday was the day before so I went ahead and ordered one. Yes the glass was tall and flavor was good,  I drank it fast.  I had no buzz whatsoever so there must have been close to no alcohol in it.  It turned out to be $11.25! My company ordered the Tuscan chicken for $17.00 and it looked really pretty but had  no flavor except olive oil.  He had to put salt &  pepper on it.  He loved the tomatoes and artichoke that came with it though.   I'm glad I don't have a sweet tooth because I wasn't about to pay $8.00 for a piece of cheesecake.  If you come here,  keep in mind,  you are paying for the name,  not quality food. The best hamburger and fries can be found at Hot Rods in Maryville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-knoxville

April R.,"Maryville, TN",95,75,64,5.0,7/23/2016,"Is there anything bad to say about the Cheesecake Factory, (other than it takes about 25 minutes top wade through the menu and there is always a wait)? I love this place. It doesn't matter if it's an over priced chain to me. The Chicken Madeira is my very favorite thing and worth the price. It's a huge dish with two big chicken breasts laid upon mashed potatoes and asparagus. It's covered in a madeira sauce that you will want to lick off your plate. It's so big that you could split it...but you won't want to.  I've ordered other dishes and always go back to the madeira. I've also had the salmon, the orange chicken, the spaghetti...the list goes on and on and I've loved everything.  My husband and I are currently working our way through the cheesecake options.

When we were seated, our server was very sweet and kindly took our order. However, when we got our food my entire family got their food before I did and I had to wait an extra 15 min until I got my SALAD. One of the servers that assisted ours in delivering our food was extremely rude and gave my mom a dirty look when she asked if she could get some red pepper. I told our server about the rude girl and she said ""I know who you're talking about"" ....if you don't like working around people you shouldn't be serving them.

Elizabeth N.,"Knoxville, TN",45,9,8,5.0,6/4/2017,"My husband and I went to celebrate our 15th anniversary. We have always enjoyed the food and last night was no exception. We had Buffalo Blasts to start and the serving was so large it could honestly be a meal in itself. I celebrated with a couple of Factory Peach Bellinis which is almost like having dessert and dinner at the same time. It's a delightful summery cocktail . My husband chose the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. I had a taste and it was delicious; not too spicy or too sweet. I had Pasta Napoletana. This dish is extraordinary with chunks of Italian sausage, slices of pepperoni, meatball, and lots of veggies. The pasta is a Parmesan cream pasta and the flavor is unique. The combination of tastes is like a party of deliciousness. For dessert he chose the strawberry cheesecake while I decided to try the Coffee and Cream Chocolate Supreme Cheesecake. If you miss the Kailua Cheesecake you will love this. It's almost like tiramisu and Cheesecake with chocolate cake on the bottom. Our server, Lexi, was attentive but not overbearing.

JD J.,"Kingston, TN",2,1,,1.0,1/22/2017,"Gave me a trash lemon, sat 5 people at a 4 person booth in high traffic, withheld pertinent cheesecake information just to make a sale, slow, terrible service and undercooked food. Never coming back.   I bought a $60 cheesecake for my mom's birthday dinner,  then after I paid for it they told me it was in a ""deep chill,"" and wouldn't be ready to eat for 2 hours. After waiting 45 minutes they sat my group of 5 people at a 4 person booth with an extra chair in the middle of a high traffic intersection when there were smaller parties at larger tables. Service was extremely slow and my food was undercooked.    This was almost within the margin of error for a busy restaurant, but what the waiter did next was entirely unacceptable. I asked for a sweet tea with lemon to go. I did nothing to the guy, but I'm sure he could tell I wasn't pleased with the over all service. I assume he thought I wouldn't notice because it had a lid, but the lemon he gave me was not fresh. I took off the lid to squeeze the lemon, and it had already been squeezed. I took a sip and there wasn't even a hint of lemon in my drink. It was an old used up lemon! Must have been pulled from someone else's old drink or out of the trash.   The manager didn't offer to comp the meal, or give future compensation, but it wouldn't matter because I won't be going back there, and I recommend everyone else to avoid this place as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-knoxville?start=20

We had the Thai lettuce wraps for the appetizer, and they were pretty good. I had the steak Diane, and found the steak to be average. The mashed potatoes were good.

No kidding a woman waved and smiled in the mirror while I was eating. The food is decent but upset my stomach and my girlfriends as well. The food is way overpriced for the qualify and atmosphere.

Kelly M.,"Knoxville, TN",1,4,,2.0,1/4/2016,"Take away another star for the disappointment factor. If you are spending over $80 for 2 people (and you will) you'd expect at least a 4 star experience, but it's just disappointing.  The service is only adequate. Our server was nice, but she didn't seem to be as well trained on first class service as I'd hoped. She didn't ask about appetizers, she didn't ask if I wanted another cocktail, she seemed in a rush and she almost didn't take my dessert order. Also the service was slower than I would expect. Again, at most restaurants that wouldn't be an issue, but for the money you'll pay, it's not what you'd expect. The atmosphere wasn't very welcoming. All of the staff appeared defeated & joyless, managers, servers and hosts included. The water glasses are made of plastic and it's impossible to sit at the tables we were at without sharing your conversation with the parties on either side of you. The menu is massive and every other page is a full-page ad (I've never seen this before) and they were out of most of the cheescakes we wanted to try. The food was the biggest disappointment. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the money. The portions are very large, but what's the point if it takes like it came out of a freezer bag? We had the Bang-bang shrimp and the Jambalaya pasta, and both tasted pre-prepared.  Having been in the service industry and having worked in restaurants before, I can attribute the failings of this place to 1 thing. Poor management. A restaurant (or any business) is only as good as the people running it. Train your staff well, enforce standards and focus on the customer experience. Unfortunately, and this is all too common, this will probably won't happen, as people are still standing in line to get in. Oh well.

Ernie And Dora H.,"Kannapolis, NC",14,167,596,4.0,3/16/2015,"Recently, my family visited the Cheesecake Factory in Knoxville, TN, on a Saturday night, but decided not to wait two hours. This weekend, we stopped in again, earlier this time. The 2-hour wait ended up only being one hour. Although jammed, service was attentive, yet we had plenty of time to savor our meal. The Fried Calamari appetizer was crispy and chewy, just the way we like it. Perfectly spiced, and paired well with the garlic dip. Since we planned to order cheesecake, we shared the Four Cheese Pasta: penne pasta, mozzarella, ricotta, Romano, and Parmesan cheeses, marinara sauce and fresh basil, and opted for the fried chicken add-on. The four cheeses blended well together, but the highlight was the chicken, tender and moist, thin strips with just the right amount of breading. The ample serving size was plenty for sharing. I chose Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake and Dora ordered Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake. This is a cheesecake factory, so you know the cheesecake was great. Dora here. Great? Oh my stars!

I mean I chuckled with her too, especially after being told that 2 hours and 45 minutes was a fairly reasonable wait. I then burst into laughter after that was followed by ""sir there is a delay because people are ordering cheesecake and sitting around"".  Is that not what people should do at The Cheesecake Factory?

Do not make the mistake of ordering a mixed drink without asking the price of everything very carefully. Nine dollar (small) margaritas seem pretty ridonculous to me. Smooth move not listing your drink prices, guys. You got another sucker who was distracted by conversation and the overwhelming menu. Also, nice job upcharging me 4 bucks for a salad you implied came with the meal.  The menu has way too many options. I would guess there are more than 100 options when it comes to food. No kidding. People don't want to deliberate that much about food. Having just one third of those options would still be a huge selection.  It was my first time eating there, but I won't go back, since I got slightly above-average lunch and drinks, for the price of a fairly high-end dinner. I'm baffled that there are so many 5 star reviews of this restaurant. Prime example of an overrated chain.

If you're looking for a little privacy be careful alot of tables offer none. I ordered some fish tacos with black beans and rice. It was ok, lacked fish, tiny amount of guacamole and the black beans were definitely canned and the rice overcooked dry and tasteless. Food also took a very long time to be served.  The wait was too long to be sitting in our neighbors laps and not feeling comfortable talking. My wife had a salmon salad (small portion of salmon) with all those green healthy things like kale. She seemed not very pleased with her food sand complained about the small portion of salmon more than once.  I think the best thing was the bread basket and piece of cheesecake we took to go, just couldn't sit in the public school cafeteria atmosphere any longer to eat our desert. BTW the piece of chocolate, chocolate chip coconut cheesecake (like a German chocolate cake cheese cake) was very good. I've been eating at the cheesecake factory once or twice a year for many years in different cities..... all I can say is the quality, quantity, freshness and flavors of the food have dramatically declined... but the prices continue to rise too much if you ask me....pretty restaurant that still gets a big crowd although I would expect that to change if the food doesn't improve to something close to what it used to be",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-knoxville?start=20
Jennie B.,"Knoxville, TN",165,227,331,2.0,6/24/2015,"Such a disappointment! My how the Cheesecake Factory has changed (and not for the better) over the years. 1. Walked in and wanted to sit out on the patio. Greeted by the hostess who told us they just shut the patio down because there is a storm coming.  This is East TN where weather men are wrong 99% of the time.  We asked again if we could sit outside. She approved it with her manager and we were the only table outside.  It was a very warm, but totally overcast day, so not too hot for outside. I cannot believe no one else was out there, but hey, it was our own private (huge) patio! 2. Waitress Danielle was very nice. Diligent. Attentive.  She did everything she could to make us happy.  3. We ordered 2 drinks- blueberry mojito (excellent) and a Bombay Sapphire on the rocks with blue cheese stuffed olives and olive juice on the side (so I could make my own dirty martini--most people make it too dirty and I hate sending things back if I can avoid it). 4. The first 'martini' came out and tasted like a jalapeno flavored vodka or liquor that was completely unlike any gin I'd ever had. My boyfriend tasted it and confirmed---it was NOT gin after all.  We aren't connoisseurs, but we know when gin is good, or bad, or non existent.  We sent it back. 5. The 2nd 'martini' arrived and tasted exactly the same.  Slightly frustrated at this point but still willing to give it a shot, we asked for Tanqueray.  I figured the Sapphire had either 1. Been contaminated or 2. Gone bad. We asked our server to taste the drink, she couldn't. We asked her to please have the manager taste it. 6. A few mins later the manager arrives with our new (and improved!) Tanqueray martini. We asked him if he tasted the other and he said 'Yes. It tasted fine. Just like gin.'  Now this is where I get REALLY frustrated.  The manager of this place tasted our drink and said it tasted like gin.  So either he 1. Had NO idea what he was talking about or 2. Has NO taste buds!  THAT WAS NOT GIN. I REPEAT. THAT WAS NOT GIN.  7. We chatted with the manager for a minute or two about what could have possibly happened.  The top to the other liquor could have been accidentally swapped and hence taken on the flavor of jalapeno (tequila he said).  OK whatever. Our new martini was just fine and delicious. 8. We ordered the spicy Jamaican jerk chicken with rice, beans and plantains.  We really ordered this because the plantains sounded great and we were in the mood for them!  The dish arrived without plantains. No acknowledgment on behalf of the Cheesecake Factory, so upon Danielle asking what else we need, I immediately mentioned--'We just need the plantains.' She turns around and looks at the food runner who says-'Oh, we're out of them.' WTF!!!!!! Now we are angry.  That's the reason I ordered the dish!  Of course there's nothing they or we can do but order a vegetable to sub, so we reluctantly accepted asparagus.   9. In all fairness--so you don't think I'm just trying to bash this place--the dish was delicious.  The sauce had just the right amount of spice.  The chicken was moist and tender.  They did a really good job with this, lack of plantains aside. 10. We ordered cheesecake to go.  Got home and went to take a couple bites and the slice was warm.  Like, melted almost. The cheesecake and cream cheese topping was falling over, like a sad little leaning tower of Pisa.  We had to stick it into the freezer for 45 mins to harden it in order to enjoy it. OK I remember the Cheesecake Factory growing up and this is not the same place.  Something has happened, or NOT happened.  But we won't be returning in the near future unless we hear that a miracle has taken place.

No. It's worth going once but I won't be running back anytime soon. I just feel like I can get a similar dish for a portion of the price elsewhere.

Casey H.,"Knoxville, TN",0,4,,1.0,7/14/2013,"Sitting here waiting on hour 3 of a 2.5 hour estimated wait.  I would never have come here of my own volition, but my wife has a work party here.  It is obvious their turnover rate and thus management is to blame.  I just watched a 4 top go unbussed for 8 mins... I can only imagine What other time wasting inefficency is going on behind the scenes.  The organizer of this event tried to do reservations and the manager rudely told her they dont take reserves and that everyone asks that.  Pretty obviously they should take reservations, at least for the near future. 3:05 after our first unlucky person put in our name- the hostess blames the party sitting at our table for the overdue wait.  They evidently are just sitting around enjoying themselves.  I relay this to our party along with a Blues Brothers joke about offering to buy these people's children to get them moving ( ).  The joke falls flat as no one gets the reference.  Boy I love mixed company. 3:10 The loungers leave.  The table is immediately bussed as compared to the earlier tables but.... 3:18- Though the table is bussed and set, we are still waiting to be seated.  This place has a half dozen hostesses on staff for whatever reason, and 4 computers where they are plugging in parties to tables first through their computer program and color coding available tables.  This takes quite some time and manpower evidently as it takes 11 minutes from our table being ready to seat us.  Two couples in our party have left. 3:21 We are finally seated.  The manager spontaneously brings out a pair of appetizers for us on the house due to our wait. 3:29 Our waitress finally shows up to get our drink orders.  Yes, 8 minutes after seating.  The lady beside me orders a beer. 3:36 Our waitress brings our drinks, no beer for my lady friend beside me.  Waitress states they are waiting to change the keg.  We finally order. 3:45 Still no beer, changing the keg. 3:48 Manager comes and states they have no more Blue Moon, he will take care of whatever else she wants. 3:54 Our food arrives and lady beside me gets her second choice on the beer front. 4:15 We are done eating.  Ask for check. 4:35 A scant 20 minutes later we get our check.  The holdup is blamed on the bakery because some other people in the work party ordered cheesecake and she thought it would be best to wait to divide checks after they got their cheesecake orders in since we have divided checks. Now I went into this place knowing there would be a wait as it is a new restaurant.  However a near 5 hour turnaround time on getting fed pretty much takes up your entire Sunday afternoon.  Pretty much uncalled for.  We had to pay a babysitter to go to this event, and ended up paying her for overtime on this one.  A comped appetizer or two does not make up for the fact that this is entirely a fubar  operation.  We were there at brunch time and left at dinner time.  Holy lord!  The kitchen seemed to be running relatively smoothly but everything else was just a clusterF of inefficiency.  If it hadnt taken so long to get our check I would have had the 18% gratuity removed in favor of 10%.  Just a poor experience all around.
