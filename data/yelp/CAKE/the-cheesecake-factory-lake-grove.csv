Orla M.,"Long Island, NY",539,256,2791,4.0,6/19/2016,"Located outside of Smith Haven mall, it's just like all the other chain Cheesecake Factory locations. The food is consistent and good. If watching your calorie count, the skinnylicious menu surely will work out for you. Just because it has significantly less calories doesn't mean it won't be tasty. I've tried a good amount of items off their skinnylicious menu and have been satisfied with each one. If you're not concerned about calories go ahead and check out their heart attack regular menu. Here's some of things I've tried on my visit to this location: Stuffed Mushrooms 450 cal $6.95 Fontina and Parmesan cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce  Spicy Cashew Chicken 2200 cal $16.95 A very spicy mandarin-style dish with green onions and roasted cashews. Served over rice. Skinnylicious Chicken Salad Sandwich 540 cal $10.95 Housemade with Roasted Almonds, lettuce, tomato and Mayonnaise on a toasted bun. Served with a green salad. Everything was yummy; their Stuffed Mushrooms were delicious and had just the right serving size for two as an appetizer; definitely a repeat order item in my book. I was very surprised how good their Skinnylicious Chicken Salad was it had just enough of all their ingredients combined for just enough taste. The Spicy Cashew Chicken was a large portion (of course it was, this is Cheesecake Factory after all); it was mildly spicy but not too much so. More sweet than spicy, good flavor for the all white meat chicken, but I would have preferred more cashews. Also, no vegetables if you're used to this dish from a traditional Chinese takeout place.   Thumbs up for the staff & customer service as well. We were seated promptly on a busy Sunday afternoon. Drink & appetizer orders were taken quickly, and our entrees arrived at just the right time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=20
David K.,"Hauppauge, NY",6,12,,2.0,12/16/2017,"Yet another bad chain restaurant with very bad food and service.If you want to wait twenty minutes before a waiter takes your order than  45 more minutes for your food to arrive , have your waiter never visit your table ,have bread bowl never arrive, have the wrong food arrive , have half the items luke warm or cold than this place is for you. NOT a good dining experience from this poorly run chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=20
Ginette P.,"New York, NY",412,791,4718,3.0,11/7/2016,"Ideally I try to stay away from places like this because it seems that no matter what time u stop by there is just about always a long wait time my most recent visit was again proof of this.  We stopped by this past weekend wait time was 45 minutes to an hour we decide to wait since we initially had a large group but ended up changing it to 2 didn't help with our wait time.  After getting a table we started with some drinks Both had the Blue Moon 22 oz, perfect it was nice & cold beer was good.  They Start u with some nice warm bread, always good alone or with some butter.  Appetizers we tried the Chicken Samosas good nice taste great cilantro dipping sauce.  Main dishes I went with the Chicken Bellagio nice chicken breast over basil pasta in a cream sauce topped with prosciutto & arugula good pasta, very light cream sauce good piece of chicken nice combo this dish.  My friend had the Mac & cheese burger it's a burger topped with their Mac & cheese balls yum very good had it with a side salad good as well.  This place gets very crowded specially around dinner time & wait times are always long this is something I don't believe will change because of its location it's helpful that the restaurant is very big & has plenty of seating.  Service was good our waitress was very nice, prices are moderate depending on what you get, decent meal overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=20

Every time I've eaten here, for dine in or take out, the food is delicious and the service is good. Love the bread so much and I love the fried avocado appetizer.

Misia P.,"Sag Harbor, NY",0,7,,1.0,1/2/2018,"I have been to this location number of time, but this time was the worst experience far. Service was slow and didn't pay attention that we were out of drinks or that I never got that promised steak knife. But the reason I'm writing this is the food. I have never had problem with everyone fish I got, except this time. For a starter we ordered tuna tartar which tasted fishy( huge red flag) if you don't have fresh tuna then don't serve it. Second app was grilled cheese with truffle oil and bacon ( truffle nowhere to be found, it didn't smell of taste like one). For the main course my boyfriend had chicken Madeira and that was good , I had hibachi steak . Asked for medium, unfortunately my steak arrived rare, not even medium rare, but rare. It says in menu that it comes with wasabi mashed potatoes which I was exited to try, unfortunately those were just regular potatoes, no wasabi whatsoever.

Julia D.,"Azle, TX",126,102,497,1.0,5/9/2017,"Wanted a quick lunch, not too heavy but tasty. Even though the restaurant was empty at 1:10, they seated me in a row of little tables next to other people.  I browsed the menu and was shocked to read that all the ""Healthy"" options have 1200 or more calories. A veggie burger for 1200 calories!  Ridiculous. I ordered the antioxidant salad for ""only"" 850 calories. It arrived, mostly greens, old yellowed broccoli, very, very few almonds.

Marisa D.,"Long Island, NY",165,278,662,3.0,8/1/2016,Wait... What?! I've never reviewed Cheesecake Factory... something's wrong here or maybe I'm just lax because well... see below. Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants even though... again see below. Cheesecake Factory I love you and I hate you. All in the same breath. I love to love you and love to hate you. Ever since you put the damn calories on the menu I feel like I should just not eat for days after eating at the Cheesecake. Maybe even months?! There are certain things I love to eat at Cheesecake and there are now certain things I probably will never eat again thanks to the damn calorie listing. My poor Chicken Madeira... oh how I miss you but you are oh so bad for me. For whatever reason this is one of my go to places with my best gal pal when we're looking to have a quick & simple bite/cheat meal. Stuffed mushrooms for the win!!! Of course there's something for EVERYONE on their massive menu. I mean EVERYONE! Whatever you crave you'll find it on their menu. Will I be back..... yes. Will I whine more about their calorie listing....... yes. That's the only reason why it's a 3. Because of those damn calories!

On a good note- They seem to seat everyone pretty expeditiously & quickly. When waiting for a table you can either take a glance at the cheesecake display & gawk at the countless cheesecake options they offer or stroll to the far for that ""cold one"". The decor is on the funky side giving off a cool vibe.  The few times I've been here the service seems great! Attentive, efficient & always willing to get you what you need/asked for... The food. Always comes out delicious.  The menu is tremendous w/tons of options of appetizers & entrees.  Too me it's a little too big , too much to choose from but there is something for everyone!

Lisa C.,"New York, NY",192,233,84,2.0,8/1/2016,"This was positively the worst Cheesecake factory experience I've ever had. I went this past weekend and I already expected crowds b/c it was National Cheesecake Day and slices of cheesecake were half off. The estimate we got was about a 30 min wait but it ended up being way over an hour. STRIKE ONE. Even after our buzzer was vibrating, we still had to wait another 15 minutes before actually being seated.  We had a lot of time to look over the menu while we were waiting so we were ready to order immediately. Most of us ordered burgers and fries for a quick meal. The food took almost 30 min to be served. STRIKE TWO. The cherry on top of this whole experience was that none of our burgers had fries. The waitress was apologetic and said they were momentarily out. How are you out of french fries???? STRIKE THREE.  We voiced our disappointments to the waitress who was very understanding and by all means was not responsible for all the strikes of the evening. She spoke to the manager and 25% was taken off our bill which was a fair gesture. Overall, do not come here if you're in the area. You'll lose your appetite by the time you get your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=20

Phil S.,"Ridge, NY",0,46,73,4.0,4/24/2017,Recently I took my family here for lunch and it was our first time here. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and was very lively for a Sunday afternoon. There was about a fifteen minute wait time until we were seated. We started with some apps which were delicious. I ordered a giant burger which was so good and everyone else had chicken salads which they all enjoyed and were huge. Each of us had a different type of cheesecake for dessert and no one left disappointed. They have dozens of different kinds of cheesecake available so there is something for every taste.

Daniel T.,"Lake Grove, NY",4,22,20,1.0,1/7/2018,"Very unhappy with the service we received at brunch this morning, Sunday January 7th. We arrived at 10:20am and the place empty.  We were a party of ten and it was for my daughter's sweet sixteen brunch.  It took 20 minutes for us to be seated when the place was empty.  Then we ordered the food and it was over an hour before the food arrived.  Then the food order was wrong for one of the 2 kids' meals and instead of leaving the one the was correct.  (The server brought both back to the kitchen - which didn't make sense to us).  Then when they brought the kids' meals, one was correct and one was an adult meal instead.  The waiter didn't apologize for it and the kids were waiting longer than the adults for their meal.  Then when the bill came they proceeded to charge the adult meal when it wasn't even the one we ordered.  The sides of fruit were missing from the meal and when we asked the waiter, he didn't even know the menu fully well and didn't know the fruit was supposed to come with it.  This waiter was clearly not trained or brand new.  He also didn't bring sugar for the coffee when we requested it.  Had to request it twice before it arrived so our coffee was already cold.  Also my son ordered the chicken and waffles which arrived cold one hour later of waiting for it.  My wife's waffles which was supposed come with chantilly cream didn't come on the plate so I had to ask for it.  The waters we requested also didn't come, we had to ask for it twice.  My oldest daughter asked for a refill of her tea and the waiter refilled it with coffee.  I can forgive one or two mistakes but this was ridiculously too many mistakes and errors both in service and kitchen.    Went there to enjoy a good meal with family and highly disappointed with the long wait and bad service when the place was empty since we arrived early for brunch.  Unfortunately, I will not be back.  I wanted you to know what a horrible experience we've had.  We've lived in Lake Grove, NY for 19 years and we typically go to Cheesecake at least twice a year but I will now go elsewhere.  Wanted you to know this because it is unacceptable if you are going out to eat especially for a special occasion and the service is bad.  I believe you need to train your waiters better and notice the time frame it takes for the food to arrive.  No one even came, not even the manager to apologize for the delay of the food; no one checked up on how we were doing or if we needed anything else.  This is unacceptable service!!!! We spent $170 but that will be the last time.   One more thing, my wife needed to use the bathroom which was disgusting.  Toilets weren't flushed and there was tissue all over the seat and floor in two of the four stalls - you need to have people check the bathroom now and then.  I waited until I got home to use the bathroom.  Sorry cheesecake but I expected much better.  Management needs to know. It appears that the Cheesecake standards have taken a nose dive.  I used to be excited to go to Cheesecake.  Now I avoid it.  Service is slow,  bathroom is disgusting and management is not making the rounds to ensure customers are happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove
Ashleigh P.,"Coram, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2017,"Horrible service, bad food, confusing decor. I went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner with my girlfriend because we received a gift card as an early Christmas present. From the outside of the building the place looks huge and could easily be two stories. However when you go inside you notice that there is only one floor with obscenely high ceilings. They could probably have used a second floor because the tables are so close together that it is even difficult for a child to get in between them.  The decor is so odd you can't tell what kind of experience you're going to get. Am I in an Egyptian tomb, looking at painted ceilings at the Sistine Chapel, or have I gone to Mordor to dine with the Eye of Sauron that is staring at me as I eat? The lights are so dim, I assume so you can't see the tacky wicker chairs and fake marble tables.  Once we sat down the waitress came right over to greet us and take our drink order. Our drinks came out at record speed which was great but that's as far as the greatness went. It is important to note that at the start of our Cheesecake Factory experience the table next to us, four people, had just started enjoying their appetizer. After getting our drinks we did not see our waitress for at least 20 minutes. When she finally came back over we put in our appetizer order and our dinner order because we were not sure when we would see her again.  Our appetizer, loaded baked potato tots, came out within a reasonable amount of time, about 15 minutes after we ordered, but this was the last time we saw our waitress for the night. The loaded baked potato tots were delicious. By this time we were there for so long that the table next to us had already ordered their dessert.  Our entree didn't come out for another 45 minutes and the table of four was long gone. I ordered the steak Diane, medium well, and shrimp scampi combo and my girlfriend ordered the fillet mignon, medium. The steak Diane was delicious and I would have it again. On the other hand, the shrimp scampi was the worst I had ever had. The fillet mignon was rare and burned on the outside. Most of the fillet was fatty and inedible. Both dishes came with mashed potatoes that were so dry and pasty that you could use it as cement. Our waitress never came over to see how our meals were and we had to go up to the bar to ask for steak sauce. Once we were 3/4ths of the way finished with our meals a different waitress came over to ask if we needed anything.  After we were done with our meals we were going to do a little shopping in the mall. We did not get very far before we were both running out of the mall because we both had to use the bathroom. This horrible meal had us both holding our tummies and having cold sweats hoping that we would make it home in time. Thankfully we did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove
Elle F.,"New York, NY",133,87,34,2.0,10/29/2017,"Not sure what happened here; either the management has changed or maybe the corporation standards for the restaurants have changed.  Regardless, this specific Cheesecake Factory has declined sharply over the last year. The menu and food used to be rich and plentiful, and coming here was a real treat for that reason alone. The menu options and portions have decreased by a quite noticeable measure. The menu has condensed over the years, but cutting corners on the portion sizes and ingredients seems to be more recently within the last year.  For example, my husband was a huge fan of the overflowing appetizer plate of Buffalo Blasts that he'd get almost weekly.  They once had very hearty, crispy breading, with a very chicken-finger-like consistency.  Though they were fried, they weren't greasy or soggy.  They have since drastically cut the portion size and changed the recipe to this very thin coating of breading that just feels like you're eating a grease-bomb.  They're actually repulsive now.  In fact, we even googled the before and after changes of this particular menu item.  Needless to say we're not the only ones who have noticed this, as we found multiple pictures and complaints. The entrees, salads and salad protein options are about half the size that they used to be, without ANY exaggeration.  More importantly, the service has taken a huge turn for the worse.  Everyone is always friendly but the attentiveness, presenting a correct order, and timeliness is actually painful. Even the wait for our first order of drinks is completely outrageous. I could almost sympathize if all the above said experiences were over the busy weekends with mall-shoppers flooding the restaurant, but my husband and I only come here during the week. Unfortunately, the days of the Cheesecake Factory being a real treat and exciting place to come for celebratory events, has come to an end; it's just another chain restaurant now.  Go spend your money at a smaller restaurant where your business and patronage is truly appreciated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove

Amy M.,"Patchogue, NY",331,162,919,4.0,4/28/2017,"I don't know why I don't feel happier about our experience at The Cheesecake Factory because really, we had a good dinner. Other than the hostess that didn't seem all that interested in helping people, and a 10 minute wait that was unnecessary (with so many empty tables)... everything else was great. Our server was excellent. Attentive and friendly, though quick about things (no lingering to chat, no real small talk). He was all about business and that's just fine. We're trying to watch what we eat so we ordered off the ""skinnylicious"" menu. We started with Chicken Pot Stickers and they were really yummy. They had a nice Asian or Thia type flavor that I'm not usually a fan of but I liked it. My husband thought it was excellent. Next, I got the turkey and avocado sandwich. It was terrific. The salad it came with was delicious (I asked for blue cheese dressing instead of the vinegarette it came with). The sandwich itself had great flavor and all in all was the perfect amount. My husband got the garlic and lemon shrimp. He loved it. It came with angel hair pasta and asparagus and the whole thing was in a light creamy sauce. He ate every single bite. Because we didn't have alcohol and decided to have dessert at home, the whole dinner was only $50 so even the price was right. Honestly, every time we go we never have a bad meal. To the contrary, they offer a great selection of food, the restaurant is huge, and the prices are what you expect. I really can't complain about anything. But for me, it's just never my first choice. Today it worked because we had to go to the Apple Store (in the same Mall) for a computer repair right at dinner-time. I think it's the ambiance I don't like. Some of the tables just feel like you're part of an assembly line. It's crowded. Shared bench-on-one-side style tables aren't my favorite. It's too close quarters with people you don't know. It's noisy.  Honestly though, sometimes it's just a matter of personal taste. Me and The Cheesecake Factory, maybe we just don't clique... because otherwise, like I said, it's a fine place to have a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove

I ordered some Crab Bites which were OK, not great but OK. I also had the Ahi Tartare which was also OK. Hubby had a burger that he liked and it was a great little stop.

Daniel C.,"Saint James, NY",83,107,538,1.0,7/25/2017,"Probably one of the worst Cheese Cake Factory I ever been too. If you are looking for a quick bite or a nice little date night this place is not the place to come. We came to this location on a Monday night expecting it not to be busy or have a long wait. The hostess who was very nice told us the wait would be about 10 to 15 mins not a problem, We were seated roughly about that time. From the moment we sat down we knew the service was going to be horrible. We came to this cheese cake factory on multiple occasions and had some horrible service only at night and by the bar area for some reason. The couple next to us was annoyed because the waitress was no where to be found and they had a hard time getting there bill and getting the bill paid. Also there was this woman next to us with her daughter and the mom was coughing her lungs out, she wasn't even covering her mouth!!!!! Gross, but any who we decided to stick it out because we waited a few to be seated.  Finally our waitress got to us and we had ample time to look over the menu. She took our drink order and we rushed to tell her our order because we knew she wasn't going to be back for a while.  We ordered the fried cheese and the shrimp tempura to start. The apps took about 15 to 20 minutes to arrive we still wasn't annoyed yet. The fried cheese was delicious but the shrimp tempura was oily and tasted old because they used old oil according to my wife.  For our entree I ordered the bacon bacon burger and my wife ordered the chicken club sandwich. The entree probably came out about another 15 mins after we were done with our appetizer. Annoyed but not overly annoyed yet. Here's where the down fall comes I'm done with my drink and was hoping for a refill because the waitress drops off our entree but she doesn't notice our drinks were low not a problem. But then she disappears again and I can see her chatting with her co-workers behind me . We had to flag her down and ask her for a refill. Now on to the food my bacon cheese burger wasn't good it felt like the bacon and the burger was sitting on the burner and the grease made everything soggy because it was probably sitting so long. My wife chicken club the first part was good the other half was soggy to the point you couldn't eat it. My wife water was low and the waitress comes by fills up the table next to us and doesn't even look our way. By then we were exhausted because we thought dinner would be about 45 minutes to an hour not a hour and half meal. The waitress disappears again my wife gets up and goes searching for her and when she finally finds her she tells her we want the bill and my wife complained to her saying she didn't even come by to refill the water. She comes by with the check and disappears again!!! Comes back 5 minutes later, we finally could check out. My wife complains to the manager and all he does is offer a slice of cheese cake for the road!!!! Which we declined.  Won't be coming back to this establishment again!!! They need to hire more staff workers. It wasn't even a busy night and that's how the service was!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove
Dana M.,"West Islip, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/10/2017,"Aweful experience. The hostess was clueless and all the staff walk around just looking at dirty tables and walk away while people are waiting to be seated. After 10 minutes of staring at the dirty booth we wanted to sit at we asked the hostess why no one was cleaning it (we went for brunch when it was very slow). Her response was ""I don't know the bus boy might be on break- he should be back soon"". What about all the staff that is just standing around!!!! We spoke to the manager, he didn't care one bit.

Alison C.,"Smithtown, NY",87,11,10,1.0,9/30/2017,When we finally got seated we had to wait for a chair. We finally sat down and when we asked for bread they gave us enough for 1 piece each and there was 4 of us. The table next to us had 2 people and had 3 loaves of bread for themselves! We asked for more bread 2 separate times and only got a refill once. They did refill our drinks regularly. We waited for what seemed like forever for our dinner. I had the Skinnylicious chicken pot pie which was delicious. Our Pear and blue cheese flatbread was good. My friends had Buffalo chicken strips that didn't agree with them. My friend had a salad that was good. My other friend ordered a well done burger that was still pink inside by the time we got it. The chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake was good.

Michael E.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",284,252,498,4.0,10/29/2016,"Friday date night at this Cheesecake Factory. So this is a chain restaurant which means decor is similar, menu the same, and seating policy the same. To be honest I'm not a fan of most chain restaurants but tonight this is what my wife wanted and, well you know ""Happy Wife Happy Life. So we arrive at around 6:30. Now this restaurant is in a shopping mall so the first issue is parking. After a few minutes of cruising around for a spot a get a pretty good one and we're off to dinner.  5-10 minute wait is not too bad and about right when we are called. Small issue, we're seated next to the wait station and after a request to move we are denied so let's just eat. We start with an app of Vietnamese Spring Rolls, which says ""enough to share"". Very true. In fact one or two more spring rolls on the plate would have been enough for the dinner. Move on... I order the Jamaican Jerk Chicken & Shrimp. Came with brown rice and beans. Not bad at all. My wife had Steak Diane & Shrimp. Also good. Then something odd happened. A waiter shows up and tells us he's our real waiter because the waitress who handled most of our meal was just filling in for him. I'm not complaining about the new waiter but just seemed a little odd to get a new waiter in the middle of our meal. Overall it was not a bad experience so we will be back. Maybe next time we can get a better table and the same waiter for the entire meal.  Lastly, prices are pretty reasonable and the quantity is pretty good too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove

I also got their White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake ($7.95), which tasted great for the first few bites - then became a little too sweet and overwhelming.

My girlfriend and I have visited a few times, and have never been disappointed. The interior is clean, warmly lit, and has a mixture of private booths and paired tables. Additionally, the outdoor seating is ample and comfortable. The service is always well-dressed and professional, and strikes a healthy medium between neglect and overbearing. The food portions aren't traditional family-style, but tend to be a little larger than you'd expect. I've ordered different dishes from the pasta menu, and haven't had any negative experiences. There are also many vegetarian options, which is helpful with group-planning. Of course, the hallmark cheesecake is delightful, albeit dense. If you're going to order dessert for two (and I highly recommend you do), try splitting a slice of classic cheesecake.

Our server (forgot her name) was very friendly, was on top of giving is constant refills, always came to check on us, and offered advice on menu items.  Portabella, avocado and zucchini sticks (appetizer): these were delish but you can't really go wrong with fried sticks of goodness. I like the two dipping sauces as well. I'd order this app again.  Thai lettuce cups: LOVE this! Chicken, lettuce, three sauces, pickled cucumbers, cilantro, carrots, sprouts, noodles. You build your own with the items provided. This appetizer is big enough for a lunch. It's flavorful and plentiful. I order this often.  Orange chicken with brown rice: Ehh, wouldn't order again. The chicken was overcooked, dried out, the sauce either evaporated or was very minimal to begin with bc it was non existent. I liked the snow peas and that's about it. I really should have sent this dish back. Thumbs down.  Children's menu: Corn dogs with a side of fruit salad. My 4 year old niece enjoyed this dish. The corn dogs (3) were big, nicely breaded, crispy but also a bit soft. They looked good! Fruit salad was chopped up, perfect for a little mouth! Farfalle pasta: Bow tie pasta with chicken, roasted tomatoes and garlic, peas, pancetta in a roasted garlic Parmesan sauce. Decent dish but maybe a bit too garlic flavored. Lots of sauce, and it's a large portion.  Bistro Shrimp pasta: creamy, lemony, lightly garlic sauce with shrimp, arugula and mushrooms. We liked this pasta more than the Farfalle.  Key lime cheesecake: if you like key lime pie you'll enjoy this cheesecake. Delicious!

Gary L.,"Woodside, NY",1076,1124,4993,3.0,9/3/2012,"I made a trip out to Stony Brook on Friday and some friends decided to treat me for dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. I've been to this one before and from what I saw, business has dropped dramatically on a Friday. I remembered waiting over 30 minutes for a table and holding on to their pagers. Today, there's no need for pagers or reservations. Cheesecake factory was half empty. Food - I ordered a Cajun Burger with fries. It had some peppers and sausages. The burger itself was pretty juicy but overall, nothing spectacular. The meal was over thousand calories so I decided not to order an appetizer since they already serve free bread w/butter. My friends ordered some pasta, it was very heavy, greasy, and well over a thousand calories too. Drinks - I wanted to order a beer but the waitress informed me about the price so I said fuggedaboutit. My friend had a strawberry daiquiri which was alright. She complained that there was too much alcohol but I disagreed. She has a really low tolerance. The daiquiri was well made and the strawberry flavor was fine.  Service - Friendly and quick. Verdict - To avoid high calorie dishes, you can try their skinnylicious menu. There is no more wait time. A slice of any of flavor cheesecake is over 500 calories. Burger prices are fair, everything else on the menu is a rip off. I gave it 3 stars because of it's cleanliness and customer service. The burger could be better and the pastas are just too heavy and greasy. Alcoholic beverages are too expensive. It can easily make a 50 dollar check turn into a 80-100 dollar check.

Nancy S.,"Smithtown, NY",99,30,,4.0,6/22/2017,"We have eaten at the Lake Grove location many times since it opened and it is very consistent in good food quality.  Our last visit we had a superstar waiter, which is not always the case.  not saying the servers are bad, they just can be a bit rushed and almost disinterested in connecting with their tipping customers.  I've also had waiters who were slow and forgetful....even when it wasn't so busy.  I have walked up to the podium with only a couple of people waiting and been totally ignored by the hostess right in front of me while they talked among themselves, not even a smile and I often feel like a 10 minute wait is not necessary because there are open tables in what is obviously an open section.   Now, the FOOD?  Yummy!  I am not a very adventurous eater, but can always find something that suits my bland palate and makes me very happy.  Many years ago, they turned me on to cheesecake, I hate them for this, and now, I am 100 pounds heavier and addicted.  They have such wonderful flavors!!  Decadent.  So, I am not always impressed with the service, but the food is worth putting up with that imperfection.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=80

""We don't have remotes, do you know what channel?"" I told her the station, but I don't have DirectTV so I don't know the actual channel number. ""Well, I need the actual channel number,"" followed by a dirty look. At this point, I get up to leave and she she says ""We're definitely not a sports bar so I don't know why you came here.""

Erik D.,"Medford, NY",229,131,20,4.0,10/29/2015,"I had taken my friend out to dinner for her birthday here just last night. We both had a wonderful time. She ordered some Blood Orange Martini that honestly did taste really good, garnished with a little sliver of orange peel. I went with a Stella 16oz. They do offer ""tall"" glasses that are the 22oz I believe he said. Our waiter was hysterical. Very friendly! Actually spoke to us like he knew us forever which I found very comical. We were ordering food, and we both were indecisive on two dishes. He kindly explained them both and then gave us his opinion.  I ordered the CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA it's Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguini. Apparently it's available over Rice as well. However it's like Regular & Spinach linguini, TRUST ME it was delicious. (Of course I took the tomatoes out haha... Typical me). After the entree I ordered the banana cream cheesecake. I honestly usually go for the Reece's peanut butter cup one, but I figured for the sake of you Yelpers, I'd pull an audible and try something different. Needless to say. It was still just as sinful as most of the other cheesecakes they have there! I also was able to taste the Dulce De Leche cheesecake as well. Also very well crafted. One thing that always throws me off, I guess because I never asked... But why does the decor remind me so much of Aladdin? Like. It's tastefully done don't get me wrong, but what's the story about it? All in all, very pleased with this establishment. It's always a pleasure visiting Agrabah!

Eva B.,"Selden, NY",108,88,88,4.0,3/31/2016,"Before you start reading this review as a super positive post, there are a few things you need to know first before just looking at four stars. The Cheesecake Factory in my mind used to mean high end, fancy, top of the line cuisine.  Ok that might have been my 13 year old mind, now, not so much.  But it still gives off the feel of that decorative, nice place to eat.  The menu has options for everyone and the food is always great, it's almost always really hard to choose what to get.  Ok, it's The Cheesecake Factory and everyone knows what it's like unless you live under a rock. This last visit in particular, it was a Wednesday night just before 7 PM.  We get seated within 5 minutes, we just sat and sat and sat for almost 20 minutes.  No one acknowledged us, no one said ""be right with you.""  It was not busy.  There were three waitresses in the area and not one could say, ""has anyone helped you yet?""  So my boyfriend (he NEVER asks to talk to the manager because he doesn't like confrontation) started to cross his arms and sit there with a look on his face.  You know he meant business... [ha ha]  I am someone that really believes that if you are going to work in a job where you have to have a fake smile on your face, you better show those pearly whites and give at least decent service.  I have worked in service jobs and I know it can be frustrating but if that's not something you're about, get a new job where you stare at a wall.  We decided to get up and leave, we told the hosts that they can reset the table because we would not be dining here.  It's like we were suddenly not invisible anymore. The hosts grabbed the manager right away (his name is Gary to be exact) and insisted that we got something out of this because of how unacceptable this is.  He said we would be taken care of and all that manager talk to get your business. We still sat there for another 5ish minutes and the guy cleaning off the tables was more concerned with our happiness than any of the waitresses.  He took our drink order and brought it over to us before our waitress (her name is Unique) even came over. If I were Unique, I would do everything I can to make sure the customers who were just about to leave, have a good experience.  She didn't seem friendly, didn't seem to care that we were getting even more pissed off by her not caring...  We got our food.  He got salmon with broccoli and I got the basil, tomato and mozzarella flatbread.  It was pretty good.  I'm glad the food wasn't rushed and thrown on a plate. At the end of our dinner, Gary [the manager] came over and surprised us.  He said he was taking care of the bill because that should never happen.  We thought we would get the appetizer or something but Gary really went out of his way to turn our night around.  Managers like Gary are hard to come by, he was really awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=60

It is rare, but Sooooooo appreciated.  The food was fresh. Very good as usual and I would definitely recommend them for take out as well as dining in. I had the eggplant parm and subbed out regular angel for the pesto pasta that was on the menu. It was delicious.

Jift M.,"Cortland, NY",0,13,1,1.0,4/4/2017,"I can't believe how rude this woman was behind the cake counter. This was my first time there and my cake was boxed and tucked behind a sign, after waiting a couple minutes I asked the blonde girl who showed up behind the counter , she is not the one who took my order, if it was mine and she said ""well did you order a tower?"" I said I don't know, because as I said this was my first time and I didn't know the  vernacular of Cheesecake Factory, in my head I ordered a slice of chocolate cake. Then she says ""Well this isn't yours then is it?"" I was kind of taken aback by her attitude which she then informed myself and the two people that were with me that she ""doesn't have an attitude, I don't even work up here, I don't know what's going on, I'm too high to do this right now!""

I could see our server talking to other staff members as my husband and I waited over 45 minutes for our entrees and with no drinks. This girl was terrible, i mean TERRIBLE.  When food did come out ( not at the same time) it was wrong but at this time we ate because we were starving.

Cheryl K.,"Parkland, FL",327,447,513,2.0,11/1/2014,"Um, Cheesecake factory, you're going downhill. At least here in this busy Long Island mall. As always, the food is pretty tasty and consistent, albeit giant portions and calories at 1500 minimum for a dinner (yes, in NY the law is to put the calories on the menu - that really brings me down). I don't know many people who could eat the entire dinner portion they serve EVER so perhaps you should make them half the size, half the calories? (I know then you'd have to lower your prices). OK enough of my preaching. Back to the food - I had bang bang chicken and shrimp - it was really good - not too spicy - had a peanut butter/thai type of curry thing going on. My husband had a mini plate - the sliders. They were average. My friend had a burrito that was the size of my forearm - of course he only ate about half. He said it was good. I've had other dishes during other visits to CF in different cities - my favorite is probably the Vietmanese Spring Summer Rolls - they're not fried, served chilled filled with chilled shrimp and noodles, bean sprouts and green herbs (my guess is basil and cilantro) and they come with a creamy peanut dipping sauce. I've also had their salads - all great. Soups are overly salty.  The real treat here is of course, their cheesecake, which is always amazingly good and is served with fresh whipped cream. Hubby and I got a slice to go and shared it at home later. (again, calories on the menu killed my dessert dreams). The service at this location is HORRENDOUS. We arrived on a Friday at about 5:45 so were seated right away before the big lines that this place is notorious for. And if they turned their tables efficiently, my guess is, those lines would move much quicker. We had to ask our server for water at least 3 times and finally had to grab a waitress who wasn't even ours to get us water. He missed out on a third round of drinks because he just disappeared. It took us about 2 1/2 hours for a meal that should've taken 1 1/2 max really.

While I don't think I have ever been here without having to wait for a seat, the food is still really good! I love how the menu has a great variety; from meats, to salads, seafood, Mexican, etc! Personally, my favorite appetizer to order are the buffalo wings. They are pretty spicy but also crunchy, which is rare yet tasty in wings! The mini corn dogs aren't bad either. As for my main meal, I often order chicken sliders or a big bowl of mac and cheese. I would recommend the chicken sliders over the mac and cheese, because sometimes, it just doesn't have enough cheese! My favorite part is the dessert; I always get the Oreo milkshake. It is very unhealthy, yet so good! My one negative here has to be the service. Last night, I waited until I was almost done eating my appetizer before I was given utensils and a napkin. Also, the food came out rather slowly.

To be honest, the first thing I wanted to do when we walked in the door, was to run back outside!  There was a frenetic, chaotic vibe that would make the most zen individual want to take an anti-anxiety pill.  The ""front desk""/ hostess station was a mess.  First off it was so loud that no one could hear each other. Secondly, It appeared to be run by 15 yo's who have never been taught anything about customer services.  They were frazzled, not helpful at all, and added to the overall chaos.  And unfortunately, we had to wait in this level of hell for almost 30 min. Front area: 1 star. However, once we actually got a seat, we had a pretty good experience.  Have to give CF kudos for having a significant amount of really good ""lite"" entrees... smaller portions of yummy stuff, and healthy alternatives.  Our waitress was lovely and helpful; and the food was pretty good.  Their drinks were interesting but a bit light on the booze.

First, the food: Eh.  I'm not one to send food back at a restaurant, because I know how it is to work in one...not easy.  Let me start off with the drinks.  The bar looked interesting and the menu had a variety of drinks.  We didn't order any alcohol though.  The appetizers didn't seem too appetizing so we went ahead and ordered our entrée.  We chose the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic.  It was way too salty.  In fact, that's all it tasted like, salt.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, the chicken was actually pretty good.  For desert, we selected the original Cheesecake - shocker.  It was quite delectable.   Second, the atmosphere: Crowded.  I felt like I was sitting in a cafeteria.  Because of the high ceilings, sound echoes loudly.  Also, the seating is very awkward.  The tables are maybe two feet (if that) apart.  I felt like I was sitting with the party next to us.   Third, the service: exceptional.  Although the food wasn't the greatest, our server was very nice and attentive.   Would we come back?  Probably not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=100
Doug G.,"Kings Park, NY",124,250,14,4.0,12/11/2014,"It's not my norm to rate major chains except in cases of abberations; either good or bad. This rating is for the positive, because I have visited many Cheesecake Factories but only frequent one. My wife and I are creatures of habit and order the same two things for each visit, and we have done this at other area francises with sad results elsewhere. The portion sizes and quality of food at this particular area happen to be above and beyond their sister locations, so this deserves merit. Major drawbacks to this location are it's immense popularity. Do not go on a weekend evening unless you like waiting for things. I also have a generic bone to pick with the francise as a whole in their drink prices. They charge Manhattan prices for mediocre alcohol, which is why I stick with an unsweeetened iced tea and get it refilled like 4 times.

Pierrette A.,"Ridge, NY",11,9,17,1.0,8/30/2016,"Before I begin this review, I have to preface that my family absolutely loves The Cheesecake Factory. With that said, our last 3 experiences have been extremely disappointing. We have all but given up on the ""to go"" because the last two times we waited nearly 2 hours for food that we were told would be ready in 20 minutes. The first time it happened, the poor runner delivering the food was the only one out there and it was her first day. She was so sweet, we let it slide...but the next time was absolutely ridiculous 2 hrs?!?! Anyway, so last night, we were at the mall and decided to give them a try. It was a Monday night, so we didn't think it would be overly crazy. We walked in and were told that it was a 1/2 wait...no problem..then two minutes later they said they had a table ready for us, but they had to clean it off. They then came to us and said they had a table available outside. Since we were all in shorts we said we would take the table outside...it took us the 1/2 to finally be seated. As soon as we walk to our table, the couple behind us were making a fuss saying that something was unacceptable and that they wanted a manager..they eventually walked out...the manager came out 10 minutes later. Of course the table we were seated at had the bill from the previous patrons. We were seated almost 1/2 hour before anyone came over to introduce themselves or take our order..and that bill was finally removed. The server that finally came over asked us if anyone had come to us we said ""no, nothing""..but we watched as 2 tables that were seated after us, had drinks, bread and appetizers and we had nothing. We got there at 7:42 and our food didn't start to come out until 9:15. Mind you, each of our plates came out one at a time waiting at least 5-7 minutes between each delivery. Meanwhile another table behind us was complaining to the manager. This was by far my families worst ever dining experience. It doesn't matter how good the food was, the experience left a lot to be desired. I would not recommend going to this particular a Cheesecake Factory location until they get their act together.

Saumia M.,"Holbrook, NY",0,6,1,1.0,6/25/2016,What an awful experience. I can't say much about the food unfortunately because I never got there. We came on a busy Saturday so we understood the longer wait for a big party. We were told 45 minutes-1 hour. We waited patiently for one and a half hours for a 10 person party. We occasionally asked the front staff updates to which they would increase the amount of time we had to wait.  So we finally got called and we're put in the corner at a round table with 2 seats missing because they took them to fit 5 people into the booths around us. The waitress seating us didn't even realize. Meanwhile they were clearing a table for 10 and we passed it. So we asked the waitress if she was sure this was our table which she was sure of even though 2 seats were missing. My brother went to speak to the manger because we waited another 10 minutes to find 2 chairs and he was no where to be found. He didn't want to deal with conflict. We left without eating and I can't say enough how unorganized and uncaring the staff is at this location. When we went to speak to the manger he  was no where to be found because he didn't want to deal with it. Don't worry cheesecake because we told 2 large groups on our way out our ordeal and they left too. I will never go to this place again because you clearly cannot accommodate large groups.

But it is still a chain and you can always tell much of the food doest have the love a chef at top restaurant puts into it.  I don't expect this nor do I rate in this respect. We selected the restaurant due to my friends gluten allergy.  Menus has some good choices that cater to this.  I tried the skinny me it choices.  Flat bread were great.  The turkey burger.  Well it was skinny by making it the size of a slider.  My fiancé tried the vegi burger. This was was a good choice.  Taste good and low calorie.  Services was horrible.  They were supper busy but still not a reason for neglected service. Overall selection is great. Cheese cakes are very good and skinny menu gives the dieting people good taste to look forward to.  Place is extremely filthy but again the place is constantly full as the wait on a sat night is about 1.5 hours.   Final summary: good average food well prepared by this location and friendly staff.  But don't expect great service and unforgettable food.  Service is hurt by qty of guest by food quality stays linear.   If you have a complex pallet you will be ok here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=120

I mean what am I going to say...It IS a chain restaurant. I do have one HUGE problem with this location (the only one I have ever been too) ... The moment you walk in the door your phone reception basically ceases altogether. It is the deadest zone ever. Only inside. I stepped out to check in. I do not like to go here for this reason. I am sorry but I do not care what anybody thinks, I need to be reachable no matter what for my own reasons. I was told by a waitress once that they have it this way on purpose to get people to focus on the dining so they don't delay themselves for long periods, tying up seats that are needed. For this, they lose 2 stars. F U cheesecake factory, If that is true. I am an adult and if you purposely scramble my signal your bugging out. If you want us out fast, hire better/ faster servers. this is the tech age we can walk and tech at the same time... I will say that the food is yummy in its mediocrity nevertheless. I have a small obsession with the brown bread with the little oats on top they plop in front of you. I in fact have an obsession with their herb crusted salmon its so damned good. Incidentally it is also the only place I will eat salmon. I don't like salmon normally. I accidentally tried my husbands once and I am stuck on it. Three stars for me is a love hate relationship.

Brianna V.,"Patchogue, NY",190,13,5,3.0,4/25/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is definitely one of my favorite restaurants! You can never go wrong with any of the menu choices. Weekends are very busy and there's usually a wait but what do you expect for a superb restaurant. Sometimes the staff is slow which drops them down one star. The environment is very relaxing and has a elegant look but the lights are dimmed to low so at night it's hard to see the menu. Also they have long booths wheres you're practically touching the stranger next to you. Starting off with an appetizer, my top two are the Factory Nachos and the Fried Mac and Cheese Balls.  The Factory Nachos come with melted cheese, pico, guac, and sour cream (you could also get meat). Now for the entrees. My top two would be the Chicken Madeira and the Orange chicken. A little pricey but for the portions and taste it's well worth it! Don't skip desert!

We usually stop here for lunch after shopping at the Smith Haven Mall. We had to wait about five minutes while they cleaned off a booth table, but there were other tables available. The place is nicely decorated, similar to all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  The first impression for me is that the menu has posted calories. Yikees!! My usual dishes were way over 1,000 calories. It's no wonder that eating out often makes it difficult to keep your weight under control. The good news is that they have a SkinnyLicious menu.  The items on the SkinnyLicious menu were creative and interesting. We ordered a Flatbread with roasted pear, blue cheese, pecans, arugula, and caramelized onions. Outrageous! The Beets with Goat Cheese, apples, arugula and pecans in a vinaigrette dressing: Delicious! Both items had so much flavor and were reasonable in size and calories.  I had the Tuscan Chicken with grilled chicken, tomatoes, artichokes, capers, basil and a balsamic vinaigrette. It was served over broccoli-rabe and farro. An outstanding dish and the chopped tomatoes seemed to be garden quality. My husband had a sandwich, the BLT, with smoked bacon, tomato, lettuce and mayo on toasted brioche bread with a side green salad. It also was a delicious meal. We had leftovers, and did not order cheesecake. We really were full and did not need dessert. We finished the meal for dinner at home, so calories-wise, it was well within normal eating guidelines. Since everything was so flavorful, we were happy with our choices. This was not diet food, just lower calorie-wise and healthier with extra veggies and salads.

Kristen C.,"Town of Smithtown, Long Island, NY",18,2,4,3.0,1/10/2014,"I have been going to the Cheesecake Factory in the Smithhaven Mall for several years now. I always enjoy my time at the Cheesecake Factory, however, it is not the best restaurant.  The food is good but not gourmet. I feel as though most of their food is too rich- for instance, all of their burgers are very heavy. I will say, however, that the menu is big enough to please most people's taste buds. There are a few dishes that I do find quite delicious. The Chicken Bellagio, the Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta, and the Four Cheese Pasta. I would recommend any of these dishes because they aren't too rich, but they are full of flavor.  The cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory is very good as well; there are so many different types to get. My favorites are the Raspberry White Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake and the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake- both are on the lighter side after having a big dinner. One thing I do not care for is the seating arrangements. I feel as though many of the tables are WAY too close to each other and this does not offer privacy, considering you can hear everything your new neighbors say. The Cheesecake Factory is always very crowded so I understand the need for a large quantity of tables, however, I feel that the space could be used more effectively than it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=160

I was overwhelmed by the menu.  I like food.  I like inventive food that is brimming with creativity and I like comfort food that is familiar and standard fare.  If you are like me, looking at this menu is like a full page calculus problem.  You don't know where to begin and feel defeated before you even start to really explore your options.  I picked Chicken and Dumplings.  It was better than I would have imagined.  Apparently the Cheesecake Factory goes to great lengths to insure the food they serve is made with fresh ingredients and is prepared to order.  No shortcuts taken.  The waitress reported that the prep-kitchen is incredible and that almost ""nothing"" is pre-prepared.  The bread is heavenly and the cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory is worth an extra few miles on the treadmill the next day.  I will visit again when I can figure out a time and day when the wait-time is less than an hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=160

Caitlin W.,"Portland, OR",91,275,1377,2.0,8/17/2012,I have been to many cheesecake factories in my days and they are all pretty much consistent food wise.  I wouldn't normally write a review here but I was disturbed by my experience here last night.  Came in an hour before closing they had plenty of tables open. Sat down and ordered a cappuccino and a hot chocolate. The server said they would be out shortly. By shortly he meant 15 minutes later. The hot chocolate was cold and had a horrible flavor. It tasted like watered down ovaltine but I didn't bother asking for a new one because waiting other 15 minutes for a new one didn't seem worth it. My mother said her cappuccino wasn't very good either. We both left our drinks more than half full that at the end of the night our server asked if we wanted to go cups. (No we didn't) Normally when you sit down at the Cheesecake Factory you are given a basket of bread with butter. We never were so about twenty minutes later we just asked for some. We waited over 50 minutes for our food in an almost empty restaurant.  By the time we got our food we didn't even want to eat anymore so we took a couple of bites and got the rest wrapped up.  The server was friendly but he was very slow.  The couple next to us ordered cheesecake and coffee to come out together. They got their coffee right away but then waited 20 minutes for their cheesecake. I am not sure what the problem was at this restaurant but they need to get their act together.  When we got up to leave we were the last ones there. I will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=180

I always wonder how their kitchen keeps up with such a large menu. Great service. In fact I have been to Cheesecake Factories in about 5 different states, this is by far the best service. Food is well done and the service is actually pretty quick and attentive. The wait can be long, but I think it is consistently faster than what they quote you in the beginning. Cons: Why is the floor so slippery? Also I understand the need to have quick turnarounds in the dining room, but they need to take more care in wiping the tables, floors and seats. I don't want to sit down on peanut crumbs Overall: Cheesecake Factory is my one of my favorites of all these chain middle/upper restaurants (Seasons 52 is the other one), for good reasons.

John R.,"Nesconset, NY",159,8,3,1.0,8/23/2015,"I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory and have frequented other locations many times. This particular location has been the sour apple in my cheesecake factory experience. The quality of food is okay compared to the tasty dishes I've tried in the past. For example, the chicken madeira in the westbury location was not as salty as this location. Also, the service here was terrible. I had called 1-2 days in advance for a pickup catering order for a family get together which consisted of several dishes. I told them the time I would pick it up and thought it would be a breeze to pick up like at the Westbury location. The day came to pick up my order and when I asked to pick it up they had FORGOTTEN TO MAKE THE ORDER! They played it off as if it was not done yet, but the fact that I had to wait 1.5 hrs for them to cook it up is evidence to the contrary. This is unacceptable service for a restaurant! I spoke to the manager and got a measly 2 cheesecake pieces for my grief, but I ended up being an hour late to the party and my mom, dad, and sister were really hungry by the time I got there. This would have never happened at any other location.

First the bad.....we entered the restaurant rpomptly at the opening time of 11:30 and was left standing as the manager finished up a pre opening staff meeting. Rah rah...go get em! Got a nice personable young man as waiter and we proceeded to look at the very expansive menu. (After replacing our rolled up napkin which for some strange reason was wet!??) I settled on the Chili Relenos Burger which was delicious as was the cup of sweet potato fries ( the best I've had so far ) Good cup of coffee and although the prices are a little high, I eat out infrequently, so don't mind paying if its good.  Note to senior management: Your 10 or 15 page menu is nice, but why do I have to look at ads on  my menu?? I mean....WTF? I know you're getting paid for it and all but it just seemed to be out of place. Especially the big ad showing a beautiful young woman in skimpy underwear selling something.

Our server was attentive and helpful. The menu is as usual, extensive and impressive. Negatives: Even at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon there was 25 minute wait. The first time we tried here, the wait was just too long and we went to California pizza kitchen next door. When we actually sat down for a meal, the food took too long to arrive. The Mac and cheese for the kids came out in a soup bowl.... Really? The plate was too hot for the kids to touch. It was obviously sitting under heat lamps while the rest of our meal was being prepared; there was a dehydrated crust of cheese beneath which soupy runny Mac and cheese began to curdle from being over cooked but too runny at the same time. The tuna tartare I ordered had little tuna, and too much avocado. There was little spice other than what tasted like the same sweet ponzu sauce used for the fried dumplings.  5 dumplings were sprawled out on a very large plate and were soaking in scallion flavored ponzu sauce; this made the dumplings fall apart easily. The warm asparagus small plate had an over cooked egg on top with too much sun dried tomato, flabby asparagus, and over toasted pine nuts. The fried shrimp basket was just OK. The mojito was too sweet, and the coke was under carbonated. I have ordered the same exact dishes at the Cheesecake Factory in Westbury and had expected so much more.

Heather L.,"Suffolk County, NY",0,69,46,4.0,1/28/2014,"Oh dear sweet Cheesecake Factory, you are one of my favorite chains. I love that no matter what I am in the mood for this place has it. I usually have my signature favorite when I go to a restaurant but here I have several. Some things you must try are the avocado eggrolls because they are to die for. I could eat that whole appetizer myself and then just lay down in the sun and take a nap while I digest. The only thing that makes me feel fatter and more satisfied than them are the fried mac and cheese balls. They're like alfredo-y, cheesy, velvety goodness with something between a bolognese and vodka sauce. They sit in the sauce on the plate and I wonder how I can eat all 4 before anyone else at the table realizes. The fried zucchini is amazing as well as the dipping sauce which is like a ranch. They are always cooked to perfection. My husband's personal favorite are the crab cakes, not the crab bites (we've never had those). I like that the wait staff always make sure to clarify if we're ordering the cakes or bites. As far as the dinners I usually stick to chicken something and it's always really good and the chicken is always juicy and not overcooked. Their alcoholic drinks are a little hit or miss depending on the bartender. I have gone there and gotten drinks that are much too strong as well as drinks that are so weak I want to know if they had alcohol in them. I know everyone comes here for the cheesecake itself, and boy do they have a very large variety of decisions but I am not a huge fan of cheesecake.  I would also like to mention that the portions are huge. It's not a cheap chain to eat at, with drinks and apps it usually runs us around $100 with the tip but you get another meal or two out of your entree.  We have also gotten take out where we did curbside to go which has been nice. Sometimes I just have a craving and don't feel like eating out. My favorite has to be going in the summer when it's nice out and not too hot and getting seated outside.  The indoor seating is hit or miss. If it's busy and it's just two of you you're most likely getting stuck at a table where you're an elbow away from another couple. I hate sitting where the bench is continuous and the tables are a foot apart and then there is a chair on the other side. I would much rather wait an extra 20 minutes for the privacy of a booth. Although when you have a bigger party to accommodate this seating arrangement works well so I see why they don't do away with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=180
Jonathan W.,"New York, NY",13,61,13,1.0,1/26/2013,"Let me start off this review by saying I usually love the cheesecake factory. But this location really rubbed me the wrong way, and I will never return.  Arrived around 6pm and it was packed. Me and the two other friends I was with waited around 30 minutes to be seated, which I had no problem with.  We were seated if you can call it that, more like being herded to a table. I felt like I was sitting on top of the table on both sides of me.  It look around 10 minutes for the waiter to come to our table and ask us what we wanted to drink. Figuring that this was gonna be a long night we ordered our drinks and food right off the bat.  Drinks actually arrived fairly quickly, waited around 25 minutes for food. Correction my friends food arrived at that time, mine did not. Once the waiter dropped off their food, he was no where to be found. We called a waitress from another table and asked if she could find our waiter for us. After 30 minutes or so, our waiter showed up, apologized said the place is very busy (as we could see) and he was helping other tables. I proceeded to tell him that my food never came, and I would still like it  (I was Hungry). Sooo he said he would go check on it, he came back to the table 20 minutes with no food, but asked us if we wanted any dessert or the check. At this time we asked to speak to the manager. Manager came over we explained the situation to him. He offered to get me the sandwich I ordered and a cheesecake of my choice at no cost. At this point I did not feel like waiting for the food, but agreed to the cheesecake (to go) since all they have to do is cut it and put it in a container/bag. Boy was I wrong, the cheesecake took another 20 minutes to arrive at the table, and would you guess, it was brought on a plate. We paid the bill, I got up took my plate over to the cheesecake counter and asked for a container myself, took about one minute.

Lisa L.,"Queens, NY",3,128,5,4.0,11/15/2011,"I knew there was a reason why the wait would be so long and why it's a factory for cheesecake... It's the birthplace of all cheesecake! The wait isn't that long, but it's suggested you don't get there too late around dinnertime. You'll be fighting everyone else for a seat. Decor is composed of different art pieces clashed together in the restaurant. The place is very dim, so watch your step! Service is very slow because there is so many people during dinner. Eat slowly! What you need to know about The Cheesecake Factor is that their meals are loaded with calories. ...But who cares? The portions are enormous. I highly suggest splitting an entree with someone, because you will not be able to finish one whole thing on your own. My boyfriend and I ordered the Crab Cake Bites for an appetizer. They looked so cute and perfectly round- and tasted perfect! Not too fishy, and had a very soft texture. Our entree was a combination platter of: Diane Steak & Maderein (sp?) Chicken, served with this very delicious sauce and mashed potatoes. It was great. I'm glad I split the entree, because the portions were enough for an individual. And of course, you come to The Cheesecake Factory for a slice of their famous cheesecakes. I saw the White Chocolate Macadamian Nut Caramel Cheesecake on their list, and my eyes instantly lit up. And of course, so good... All in all, loved it. But the service took way too long for me to get even my appetizer!

This particular location opened while we were living elsewhere and it has become one of our usual haunts. Part of the appeal for us is that it is part of the Smith Haven Mall complex, so we can stop by before or after shopping and it becomes part of a longer day. Before I started to seriously watch my diet, I would order the Spicy Cashew Chicken over brown rice, which is fantastic. Once I started to be more careful with what I ate, I was pleased that Cheesecake Factory has a very large SkinnyLicious menu which makes it possible to have a full and satisfying meal without destroying your diet. I had a Greek Salad and the Soft Tacos last time I was there (both from the SkinnyLicious menu) and the whole meal was under 900 calories. The downside of this location is that it is very, very popular and when it gets busy, it gets very, very busy and there can be a long wait to get in.

Emma C.,"Centereach, NY",34,4,,1.0,3/10/2016,"This review is only pertaining to the awful customer service at this location, not specific to the food at all. The reason I can't review the food, is because we were never actually seated to eat. We arrived at the restaurant, were told there was a 30 minute wait. This was fine, we had two small kids with us, but no biggie we would stick it out. An hour later, we asked the lady at the desk what the status was since we had waited TWICE the allotted amount of time and were getting increasingly frustrated. The lady shrugged us off and told us she had no idea. Five minutes later, we saw the man we originally booked the table with, so we inquired, he said ten more minutes. Ten minutes passed, he saw us getting antsy so he approached us and said five more minutes. Five minutes passed, and nothing. We ended up leaving the restaurant, hungry and annoyed. This wasted over an hour of all our time, and with two young children, you can understand the frustration. This facility needs to work on their customer service, and their knowledge of when they are able to seat someone.

Jill F.,"Manorville, NY",190,232,165,5.0,4/3/2014,"How have I not yelped this place before?!! Haha. I love this place... DECOR: Very nice decor inside, huge high ceilings and a very detailed/artistic style of decor inside. The only thing that bugs me is the lighting is too dim (in my opinion at least). FOOD: What's important to know about this place is that it is a chain restaurant, yes, BUT it is a huge step up from your typical Applebees or TGIF. 1. the portions are much bigger, and 2, the food is much better quality. I have a friend that works here as one of the cooks, and I always ask him what stuff is frozen, what is freshly made. At Applebees, almost everything they serve you is frozen and reheated. Surprisingly, at Cheesecake fact, the ONLY thing frozen (according to my cook friend) is their cheesecake! All the other food on the menu is freshly made. You can tell, too. Because items like their orange chicken, mashed potatoes, mozzarella sticks, chicken marsala, burgers, etc are to die for. I highly recommend the orange chicken entree though (but ask for mashed potatoes instead of rice). SERVICE: Not bad service here, usually pretty friendly waiters. If you're coming here on a weekend night, prepare for a wait. Usually not bad, maybe 40 minutes-ish. But almost always a wait if its a fri-sun evening. They have a pretty large bar though that you can wait at and if a spot open up for you to sit, you can just sit and eat your dinner there. Did that once, cut the wait time from 40 minutes to 5 haha.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=140

This is one of the better places to eat whilst in Long Island. I was surprised at the customer service. We didn't book ahead and yet we were seated in around 5 minutes in a nice booth. Reading the reviews I expected the service to be poor/Mediocre at best. Our server was polite and attentive, unfortunately I can't remember his name.  I Ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and the lemon sauce was some of the best I have ever had, it wasn't too tangy or overpowering. The crispy chicken was lightly crumbed, and not overbearing. It was a tad odd having potato skins in the mash potato but they were cooked in a way where it blended well with the entirety of the dish. It didn't make the mash lumpy either. My only complaint: the Asparagus was like rubber, over cooked. So I didn't touch it. I let the waiter know my thoughts both good and bad about the meal and he was understanding and communicative.

Prices were decent and portions were huge. I got a pizza lunch special where my side salad was bigger than my torso. The pizza was flavorful but a bit too soggy in the middle and had questionable crust. I did not finish it- too big, way too big! SO and I also opted for apps or small plates as they call it (b/c we're fatties like that). There was a zucchini/avocado/mushroom fries plate that we loved (loved!) and spicy shrimp in chipotle sauce (also good). Can't remember which pasta SO ordered but it was big as well. As we always come here and leave too full for dessert, we decided to force one down. After pouring over their extensive menu, we opted for the carrot cake/cheesecake (learn from our mistake- don't do this!). It basically reminded me a drunken baking session and had the 2 lumped together haphazardly instead of being the delicious description we read.

As soon as the waiter found out I am gluten free he told me everything they have gf tastes like cardboard. I wanted to go home and not waste the money but we stayed. I ordered a gluten free cheeseburger and fries. I asked for medium well. I got medium rare. The manager came out and apologized so that was nice. They re cooked it and the waiter was right. The bun was awful. I've been gf for a year and a half for medical reasons, and I know the gf products well. This was clearly a cheap brand and that makes all the difference. The fries had a funny taste lin the background but I ate them anyway due to the fact I couldn't eat my burger.

André C.,"Brooklyn, NY",235,21,17,4.0,7/16/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is the Ritz-Carlton of franchise restaurants! The menu is the size of the Bible and the food is the size of Manhattan. It is the ultimate attempt in legitimizing ""American"" Cuisine (whatever that means). Compared to the CF in Westbury and Huntington this one is far smaller and it appears to be less known since the wait wasn't very long. The wait staff is eager and --as is typical at CF--very attractive.  I had the usual Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane combination. I have had this dish many MANY times in other CFs because it's my favorite. This location, however, didn't prepare it the way I'm accustomed to tasting it. The steak diane did not have the worcestershire sauce that accompanies it and the Chicken Madeira appeared ... well... to be a normal portion. The food was exactly as promised in the other CFs but not this one. My date had a Chipotle Chicken Pasta which was perfect. It was the right blend of spice and cream and after we let the volcanic temperature cool we tasted a yummy wannabe-Mexican dish.  The appetizer was a typical quesadilla. It was stuffed with really good chicken and a healthy serving of guac, sour cream and pico-de-gallo. The cheesecake was the expected enormity of calorie goodness that CF is known and loved for. I got the Red Velvet Cheesecake and it was bar-none the BEST cheesecake I've ever had. Moist, thick, creamy and sweet, it made the experience religious. My date had the Godiva cheesecake. Grant it, I like Chocolate, but you need to be a serious cocoa lover to eat this thing. It's an overpowering dose of chocolate both unsweetened and semi-sweetened. The lack of cheese in the cheesecake did not escape me, it tasted more like a chocolate pie and since this is as American as it gets... I guess we can call it whatever we want.   If it were the CF in Westbury it would have been an easy 5 stars but since I didn't try the drinks, survey the bar or really order enough variety I must don upon it a 4 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=200

Our appetizer was delicious, we had some of their hot wings. I was disappointed with the entree though. I ordered one of their signature burgers and I did not enjoy it. There was nothing special about it, almost as if I had ordered a burger from a fast food chain restaurant. The cheesecake, of course, was by far the most excellent part of my experience. We ordered a slice of white chocolate and macademia nut cheesecake and it was heavenly. Our service was good, no complaints about that.

If you've been to one before, I need not tell you that the menu is huge and the prices are fair, especially considering the oversized portions. I love their portobello mushroom sandwich and their luau salad! Speaking of which, their salads, like everything else, are larger than life, so come hungry or order with the intention of splitting your dishes with company.

Kristel K.,"Sound Beach, NY",18,12,,4.0,5/23/2011,"I'll preface this review by saying Cheesecake Factory really isn't anything special -- it's basically a more upscale version of Applebees or any other American eatery in a similar vein. However, with a menu that's over 20 pages long and with options ranging from Mexican to Italian to Asian and your standard choices (burgers, club sandwiches, chicken, etc.), you really can't go wrong. It's so eclectic, and you can even opt for breakfast--which is served all day long--if you're feeling something different.  My dining experiences over the years have been varied. The first time I ever went to CF, my friends and I literally spent 3 hours just for a simple lunch and cheesecake. Took nearly a half hour just to get seated, then another half hour for the waiter to get our drinks once we did get a table. And it was lunch time during mid-week so the crowds weren't awful. And another time my friend and I were seated at the long rows of tables where everyone is crunched together (so basically you're knee-to-knee with a complete stranger). But it was super packed that night so it's understandable. But I have had some wonderful experiences too. I find it's best to go with a group of friends you want to catch up with (especially if you're seated at that half-circle shaped table with the lit-up wall behind you...so intimate and cool! Oh! And the little tables outside with the heated lamps are always very nice when you wanna eat outside!) because the wait won't seem so bad once everyone starts chatting. The bread basket they serve before your meal is to die for! (I prefer the pumpernickel over the white). Appetizer and meal wise...hits and misses. The ceasar salad, while good, had a little too much garlic, and an unmistakable anchovie flavor to the dressing that made it slightly sickening. My breath was so rank afterwards! The buffalo chicken sandwich is yummy, but then again I am a big fan of anything smothered in hot sauce, lol.  Yeah, but let's face it: we're all there for the cheesecake. And this is where CF excels and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. The choices are all so delicious that you want to try a different one each time, and more often than not you aren't disappointed. The Banana Cream Cheesecake is a personal favorite (light, creamy and just enough banana), but I also love the White Chocolate Raspberry, Tiramisu, and Key Lime. Portion sizes are usually very generous (although I've noticed they tend to skimp when you're taking out) and worth the hefty $8 price tag.  Overall..come for the cheesecake, although the place will do for a night out with some friends. Nothing spectacular as far as dinner goes, but the cheesecake is memorable and leaves you coming back for more. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=200

Kasey L.,"Long Beach, NY",0,22,1,3.0,7/24/2014,"Service is totally hit or miss.  The bad: I've had the worst service of my life there. Our waiter took our order and then vanished. I ordered some kind of chicken tacos, my friend ordered a taco salad, and our other two friends ordered pasta. Our glasses were empty pretty fast and all of the bus people passing by didn't offer to fill them. Someone came and dropped off the pasta (still no water in our glasses) and we waited for the rest of our food... Maybe 20 mins later our waiter came by to ask if they wanted the pasta wrapped up. We told him we hadn't even gotten our food yet and he simply said ""sh**!"" And walked away. He came back with our food which had clearly been sitting in the window for the last 20 mins. My tacos were so soggy that they fell apart when I touched them. Still empty glasses btw. The waiter didn't ask how things were or even come back at all. I ended up calling te manager over and my food and dessert ended up being free. I'm a waitress myself and i can't imagine providing such awful service without at least apologizing. Had he profusely apologized it would all have been chalked up to a mistake, but his nasty attitude ruined it.

Apparently the recession hasn't hurt this establishment! Service: our waitress was pleasant, efficient and thorough. Drinks were refilled without asking and she always had a smile on her face. Appetizers were delivered promptly and the main course followed in a proper interval. In spite of the crowd, we never felt rushed. Ambience: noisy, chaotic, and active. But, if you come to a CF expecting anything else, shame on you. The chaos is the vibe. This is not a quiet romantic dinner spot! Food: solid if unspectacular. The pizzeta appetizer was actually very tasty. Not fancy but good. The main courses were universally good. The exception was my chicken Caesar which was way, way overdressed (almost to the point of being inedible). As I said, no complaints from anyone else and the large portions were reflected in the number of take home packages! The desserts were, as usual very tasty. Summary: a nice night out.

Patty M.,"Henderson, NV",159,52,7,2.0,8/2/2013,"WIth a lack of decent places to eat at near the mall (if you want something other than burgers and pizza) we decided on the Cheesecake factory I agree with Rohit M.  who said you go when you have no where else or are bored with every other place.  I would have given it three or four stars but had to deduct for poor service, long wait for food and excuses from management.  We were seated in a nice, roomy booth in front. The waitress came right over to take drink orders, but she seemed overworked and not at all friendly. When we asked her about different dishes, her replies were very curt, like yep, dunno etc. After placing our food order we waited 40 minutes before we saw our food. A different server came over about about 30 minutes and explained that the wood would be out shortly. after 35 minutes I asked to see a manager it took a few minutes for him to come, but in the meantime, our food finally arrived. Two of us ordered the fried shrimp, one got soft chicken tacos off the skinnylicious menu and one ordered chicken parm sandwich. The shrimp platter had plenty of large, golden brown shrimp, a nice dish of coleslaw and fries. It came with both tartar and cocktail sauce. I was happy with the shrimp but the fries were cold. Hubby said the tacos were good and son liked his sandwich. My big issue was how the manager handled the situation. He cheerfully explained that so many people ordered the shrimp that they had to bread more and that took 30 minutes. BUT he said at least our shrimp was nice and fresh! Since I'm a stickler for customer service, I would have preferred 1. to be told that it would be 40 minutes for shrimp and offered something else if we didn't want to wait 2. being offered an appetizer while we waited or 3. after waiting that long, we should have been at least offered a complimentary slice of cheesecake. I scratch my head at the lack of training managers get these days. His excuses just made the situation worse.  Believe it or not, we didn't order dessert because we were pretty exasperated with the whole experience by the end of the meal. I've never gotten great service at this location, so we will usually only go as a last resort. My thought is the Cheesecake factory doesn't NEED our business because people will go there anyway, so why bother with customer service?

George C.,"New York, NY",0,7763,14308,4.0,12/28/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places where mediocre food is saved and magnified by good company. I come here with insistent, stubborn dates and large groups of friends...ONLY. I find the CF surprisingly endearing, and I'm enamored with it perhaps because experiences here are always celebrations, splurges, or dates not of the first, awkward variety. Long waits, sprawling decor, fickle lighting schedules, and oft-torrential service characterize this joint on most days/nights. The space out back is newly improved, and to-go cheesecake always tempts me when I'm at Dick's. On my most recent experience (there are too many to count), our table was saturated when we sat down, which wasn't a great start, but we moved on...Until, of course, we received a single bread basket for 5 people and no offer to bring more. Whatever. It's the CF. So the tamale cakes were good and the Jamaican black pepper shrimp was better than I expected, but I need to check their site for calorie counts and nutrition info. The same can certainly be said even for the Lemon raspberry cheesecake, which was relatively light in the grand scheme of their cheesecake offerings, and pretty flavorful.

Rachel:  I'm said I'm full!  Why would you give me water? Chun:  Just a courtesy... Rachel:  You know what's a courtesy?  Making this stomachache go away! *Note:  This is the part where I think to myself that Rachel was the one who suggested we go to Bobby's Burger Palace for lunch.  As is the boyfriend, I shall accept blame! 2 minutes of walking through the Parking Lot later... Rachel:  Is that? Chun:  Yes it is! Rachel:  Cheesecake Factory! Chun:  Strawberry Cheesecake? Rachel:  I'm not full anymore! We got a slice of Strawberry Cheesecake to go and ate it in the nice 75 degree outdoors...  As with almost every Cheesecake Factory, the flavors are resiliently similar & profoundly appreciated! Strawberry Cheesecake: At first reception, the excessive portion size of the Cheesecake spoke wonders to the receiving eye.  Patrons will notice that the 10 oz. to 12 oz. serving size of the Cheesecake will force any patron to seek a take out box.  Luckily, the excessive offerings produced a welcoming satiety to those seeking gluttonous punishment.  During visual inspection, the Cheesecake was observed to have the proper white color that's accompanied by an elegant soft texture.  The graham cracker crust, acting as the base of the foundation, contained a semi-firm texture.  Finally, the Fresh Strawberries and syrup produced an excellent color contrast to the application.  At first bite, patrons will find that the primary taste observed is from the light, velvety, and fluffy cheesecake.  During consumption, the creamy texture of the application engulfs the palate by releasing the notable cream cheese flavors.  Further tasting will reveal notes of vanilla, brown sugar, and butter, which enhance the creaminess of the cheese by providing a subtle sweetness.  All ingredients used in the creation of the cheesecake work harmoniously to create both an abundance of flavors while keeping the subtle soft texture of the cake.  To aid in the textural contrast, the semi-crunchy graham cracker crust provided the scrumptious surface and cinnamon flavors to further enhance the cheesecake.  Although the Strawberries provided the round about freshness and earthiness to the application, it acted secondary to the palate consuming flavors of the cheesecake. Perhaps perfection is observed through The Cheesecake Factory's rendition of Cheesecake.  By creating an edible that embodies the palate clasping flavors of the ingredients used while keeping the integrity and structure of the creaminess of the cheese, the application stands above the rest in both the complexity and tasting of this application.  Few remarkable words can be noted regarding the superb execution of the cheesecake, but the ones rendered should be emphasized for its extraordinary flavors and execution. Dessert was done and overstuffed is an understatement.  Luckily, food coma didn't kick in until after returning from the drive home...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=220

Renee K.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,72,,5.0,11/10/2007,"wow I love this place, their salads are amazing, they are so good. Their bread is fantastic, warm and yummy oOo it was so good it was sooo embarassing but I had to ask an waitress to bring me some more. Atmosphere is great for family gatherings, night out with friends, or romantic but casual dinner with your boy/girlfriend. Prices are very cheap, considering its food quality, service and atmosphere.It's truly a bargain. Of course, their cheesecakes are a killer. Waitors waitresses are very friendly and nice. Try chicken burger, it was the best chicken burger I ever had. it was so juicy and tender my mouth is watering now....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lake-grove?start=240
