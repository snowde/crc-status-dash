James R.,"Northside District, Lexington, KY",19,7,11,5.0,1/7/2018,"Have been to The Cheesecake Factory several times either dining in or getting cheesecake to go. Whether dining in or getting cheesecake to go the menu is huge! The dine-in menu seems very Guy Fieri inspired, what with its cheddar blasted wasabi infused pretzel bites and beer battered ginger glazed egg roll nibblers. However, i am always able to find something goon the menu.  This time in particular we got cheesecake to-go. Of course there are so many to choose from. There's always the option of taking home a 6-inch regular cheesecake, which is big enough to satisfy even the biggest size queen. However, whenever I go my strategy is to pick one chocolate type cheesecake and a non-chocolate cheesecake.  The first slice I got was Oreo cheesecake. To say it was rich is an understatement. It featured chocolate ganache, a cheesecake layer, Oreo cookies inside and a base layer of chocolate cake. Of course it was delicious and enough for 2 or 3 people to share. A lesser man would have stopped there, but not me. I decided to get another slice. This time the celebration cheesecake. It has cheesecake, birthday cake layers, strawberry and vanilla flavoured mousse and a blue frosting layer as well. Very delicious and rich. I'm going to enjoy this slice in two sittings. Either way, it's worth the trip. Go, have fun, take a date and enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2
Dennis W.,"Lexington, KY",246,163,626,2.0,11/30/2017,"I've been here three times now, and I can honestly say that I'm not impressed with their service and food. My second time here, I visited with a friend. We just wanted some appetizers - specifically, eggrolls. We went for the sampler, but asked for an extra avocado one in place of the salmon. We received the avocado and Cuban, but no southwest. The waiter said he'd fix it, but out came more Cuban rolls. Once again, waiter wanted to fix it. More avocado rolls came out. Finally, the southwest ones arrived but at that point we were just ready to go because we had been there for two hours.  During the visit, I noticed they do Sunday brunch. My hubby and I have it a try a few weeks later. Service was on par, not great. I ordered eggs benedict, and asked the waitress how their poached eggs were turning out. She said perfect since a corporate chef was there doing some training. Food arrives, and the eggs are not poached medium like I requested. So the waitress sent the entire plate back. Joe's don't eating by the time my food arrives. This time, poached hard. They were done, so I ate them but I was not surprised at that point it was messed up.  If you go, just order cheesecake to go. You'll be happier and spend a lot less if you do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2
Samara B.,"Lexington, KY",163,381,3357,2.0,10/6/2017,"I don't know why I ever think about coming here. The food is expensive for what it is. The cocktails are super expensive ($10-$12 for a mojito or margarita?!?!?). The service sucks. And the food isn't great, except for the cheesecake.  We ordered the eggroll sampler (4 different types of eggrolls: avocado, salmon, Cuban, Southwest) without the salmon, sub extra avocado. Seemed simpled enough. When it came out, it only had avocado and Cuban. We told the server who wanted to fix it. Then two more Cubans were sent out. Well that wasn't right. So then 2 avocado were sent out. Still not correct. Finally, we got the southwest. By then we were done; we wanted a box and we wanted to leave.  But the pumpkin cheesecake was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2
Brian C.,"Northside District, Lexington, KY",0,2,,3.0,1/7/2018,"Recently went to the Cheesecake Factory on a busy Saturday afternoon. I had never tried the brunch menu since I thought it was only on Sundays but to my surprise it is served both Saturday and Sunday until 2pm. We arrived right at 2:00 pm and were told by the friendly staff that we could still order brunch though they had officially stopped taking brunch orders. I ordered the brunch combo which was eggs made to order, bacon, and pancakes. They were nothing special but definitely good.  My date ordered the French toast which was also good and filling. Once again nothing special but definitely worth ordering again. Overall a good experience with a five star rating on service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2
Craig U.,"Lexington, KY",148,309,858,5.0,11/20/2017,"We went here on a rare date night after going to the movies for some cheesecake.  I must say, this is definitely a step up from my usual post-movie Taco Bell.  The cheesecake was excellent, and the staff surprisingly was pretty okay with us just coming in to order dessert.  No eye rolls or excessive waits.  Will have to do this again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2
Shannon E.,"Beattyville, KY",23,55,47,4.0,9/23/2017,"If you don't mind an unusually long wait, this is a really good restaurant. The complimentary bread was very welcomed after waiting 45 minutes for a table (granted, there were 7 of us). The brown bread is really delicious, the white tastes okay but is really tough. The nacho appitizer was more than enough for an actual main course (as one guest decided to order).The burgers and fries were awesome. And the pasta dishes were large enough for dinner and lunch the next day! And about that cheesecake...Oh My Goodness!!!...I totally understand how they got their name!! The cheesecake is devine!! Everyone at our table got a different kind and they were ALL amazing!!  Overall:  Pros - Awesome Food, Unbelievable Cheesecake, choices galore, a beautiful restaurant and good service. Cons - LONG wait times and No Free Birthday Dessert (boo!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2
Tina L.,"Lexington, KY",1,100,240,2.0,9/12/2017,"My opinion on this location has changed based on multiple visits that have been a disappointment one after another. The service is not what it once was, its very slow, the servers are not as friendly, the food quality isnt as great as one would expect and the manager is snippy. How they pay attention to cleaning areas has gone down as well. I have been to many others that have been consistant with the service that TCF is known for. This location isnt doing them any favors with how they have changed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2
Morris H.,"Lexington, KY",33,4,,2.0,1/7/2018,"The food was ok but the entire service process was terrible. We walked in the door and stood for over 5 minutes while a young man was on the phone. He never acknowledged that we were there until he got off the phone... he said two? And turned around and started walking. We followed him without knowing if we were supposed to or not. He took us to a table laid menus and said nothing. All that was ever said to us was one word ... ""two."" We sat there for another few minutes until our server showed up and wanted to know if we wanted bread? We said yes thinking he might ask about drinks or apps to buy no he walked away, I'm assuming to get bread. After about another 5 minutes he showed up  with bread. Then we ordered drinks and before he walked away I said we want to complete our order. We did place our order and immediately received our drinks. We were not so fortunate with our food. No waiter and no food for 20 to 25 minutes. My wife ordered Monte Cristo and I ordered the French toast with bacon and added potatoes. Our entrees showed up after around 30 minutes by I did not get potatoes or bacon. The food runner who dropped off our food said enjoy. I told her I was still missing food. She sighed and said ""OK."" She came back a couple minutes later with potatoes but no bacon and this time got away before I could get her attention. Still hadn't seen my original server... suddenly my server showed up and wanted to know how all was. I said I was missing bacon. He looked at me and ""yes I think you might have ordered bacon with that. "" It took a few but I got my bacon and all my order at the table. The Monte Christo and French Toast were good but the bacon I had worked so hard to get had obviously been cooked and kept in a warming drawer for hours and wasn't good. After I finished my food I told my wife that I was going to stack all the dishes up at the end of the table and see if that gets them removed. Many servers, managers, hosts and what looked like cooks passed but the leaning tower of Piza remained until our waiter finally came back. All in all our food wasn't too bad but the service was no where equal to the prices paid. I have no desire to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2

Isa M.,"Georgetown, KY",0,34,88,5.0,6/30/2017,I really enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant. I recommend to look up the menu before you get to the restaurant so you have an idea what you want to order before the waiter gets to the table. Otherwise you might have to wait a little for him to come back. It is a very big menu. Take a look at the menu and prices:     If you download the app you can see pictures. That was very helpful. The food is really tasty. Love the Crispy Cuban Rolls and the chicken wings. And I really recommend the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheese Cake.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2

There was no wait as we went late and on a rainy night. The menu is over 20 pages so there is probably something you will like. The bread they bring you when you sit down is excellent and the staff was friendly as well. My food was good only the portion size was a bit smaller than I remember but still a lot of food.

Lana F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,6,3.0,2/4/2017,"Everyone seems to love Cheesecake Factory and I've never seen the appeal. Grant you, I didn't go there until two weeks ago. That's right, I'd never been, then a friend and I decided to go there for lunch.  Right after being seated the waitress came and invited us to ask her questions. I decided to navigate the 21 page menu by myself. I settled on ordering the calamari and macaroni.  The calamari was over breaded and over fried, which is usually a sign of tough, unmassaged squid. The two sauces it came with were good and covered up the tasteless sea food.  The macaroni was brought out in a cast iron dish. The top was crisp and warm, like all good, country macaroni should be, but underneath it was an ocean of too milky creme. The cheese sauce that usually adds to the macaroni drowned it out and I was disappointed after hearing all the hoopla. What saves Cheesecake Factory is its fish tacos. My sisters birthday was the other day and of course she picked this restaurant. I decided upon the fish tacos with white rice and beans. The fish was panko fried and the sauce they paired it with was excellent. Chopped pepper, avocado and onion brought it all together nicely.  The service was lovely and they sang Happy Birthday to my sister. It's probably not my first choice and I doubt I'll go again unless it's someone else's Birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2

Arvin B.,"Lexington, KY",46,398,112,4.0,7/16/2015,"Went to this place today to try out a slice of the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, recommended by a youtube food reviewer. I went in to get a carryout order of the cheesecake and felt that I should try the Chinese Chicken Salad as well. Immediately, I was helped out. The gal said it would take 15 minutes and really, I had the order in my hands within less than 10! Speedy customer service.  When I got home, I opened it up and the portion size was HUGE!!!! It also came with free little white curly chinese cruton things and the sesame salad dressing. The cheesecake portion was huge as well. Had taken a fork full of salad and it was delicious! The cheesecake flavor was like a taste of HEAVEN!!!  Backstory (yawn)...The first time I ate at The Cheesecake Factory was when I was in California, very young with my family. So glad one popped up here. Also, to anyone who says it is expensive: Stop being whiny stinges! This place is obviously not tuned to Kentucky's cost of living, as it is HQed in California! If you are as big of a foodie as I am, do some ground work research of the restaurant you want to eat at. Know where it is hqed and history (okay...maybe I am just that nerdy enough to do that~) If you cannot afford to eat at this place, then do not.

Kevin S.,"Lexington, KY",17,17,2,3.0,4/19/2016,"I have never felt more indifferently about a restaurant in my life. The Cheesecake factory is the latest major national chain to make its way to Lexington and as such is located conveniently connected to Fayette Mall. It has so so quality of food that is present in all huge chains like this but it is somewhat paradoxically built like a casino buffet in Las Vegas. If Zeus opened an upper middle class restaurant chain, it would look exactly like this, I'm sure. Looking at the menu is an extension of the debate; ""what are we going to eat tonight?"" If you haven't fully made your mind up, just go to the Cheesecake Factory because they're 12 page menu full of nearly every kind of cuisine just short of BBQ (they might have BBQ, I dunno) will certainly give you room to figure it out. It feels odd getting a Cuban sandwich or Jambalaya at an (Italian?) restaurant, but I've done both and can honestly give the Cheese Factory a solid ""meh"". The cheesecake menu is equally robust. I once went to the Coco Cola museum in Atlanta where they had the coke machines from around the world. I'm fairly certain they had less flavor choices than the Cheesecake Factory offers in its deserts. One could try a different cheesecake every night and I'm not sure how many nights that would take but the onset of diabetic comas would make the matter moot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=40
Pepper T.,"Lexington, KY",60,215,70,1.0,1/3/2015,The husband and I receive the gift card for Christmas and decided we would stop in to get a couple of cheesecakes slices to take home. I called the curbside to go because nowhere on their menu doesn't state they cannot take cheese cake orders over the phone.  After waiting 10 minutes on hold I was told that they could not take my cheesecake only orders and that we would have to come in and order and wait 10 minutes. I think we will be regifting the gift card and stick with our local mom and pop eateries.

Heather P.,"Lexington, KY",1368,1368,6019,2.0,11/24/2014,"This is the smallest Cheesecake Factory that I've ever been to. Maybe that's a big reason why the wait is always so long. The first time that I attempted to eat at this new location was a weekday around noon. The wait was 90 minutes and I decided that I was too hungry to wait.  Here is my opinion on the wait... if you're going to the mall and will be walking around or shopping for the amount of the wait, then it's not a big deal. What is a big deal and a major annoyance, is when people sign in, and wait at the door and just inside the entrance. Both times that I've been there people are doing just that, like they have no clue that they will text you when your seat is available and you have 10 minutes to get there. Not to mention that they stand and stare at the people dining near the entrance and gawking as the cheesecake is brought from the bakery area. The time that I actually stayed and dined.... there wasn't a separate line for the people who just arriving and were signing in and the ones whose tables were ready. So, the ones whose tables were ready seemed to be rudely cutting line, but it's actually a mismanagement that will hopefully be worked out. When you sign in and give your phone number, they give you a receipt to present once they text you to let you know that your table is ready. That is the only organized part about the check in stand. Otherwise, it seems chaotic even though there were four hostesses, only one was taking the names and phone numbers. Finally, I was seated and my drink order was taken and my soda brought immediately. The weird thing was that the waiter continuously grabbed my soda and took off with it to refill it... every time that it was even remotely near the half way mark. It was annoying because it was literally minutes each time until his return. In all of my days of dining out, this was a first... I've never complained about getting refills... until now.  The menu could use less advertisements and more pictures of entrees... until then, hopefully more people will post entree photos on Yelp ;) The waiter was pretty attentive, except we didn't receive the complimentary bread until our appetizer was brought out and the people at the tables on each side of us, who arrived after us, received their food entrees prior to our appetizer... strange. When we finally received the fried avocado egg rolls, they were excellent, just as the last time that I ordered them, in Miami.  For my entree, I ordered the fish tacos and they came out cold and tasteless. My husband ordered a Jamaican shrimp dish that came out piping hot, so I assume that my meal sat while his was being prepared. After the long wait after ordering, I was looking forward to enjoying my meal... not so much.  The entree prices are a bit steep but the sizes are big. For example, my entree of fish tacos, came with four tacos, beans and rice. Everyone was leaving with leftovers. I ordered the Reese Cup cheesecake and it tasted more like peanut butter fudge than Reese Cup or cheesecake, but highly worth a revisit. All in all, I think that the quirks will eventually be worked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=40
Rachael F.,"Lexington, KY",0,2,1,1.0,10/16/2016,My husband went in to order us some cheesecake to go. It took him about a total of 20 minutes to get the cheescake.

After a wait of 40 minutes (which was normal) we were shown to a really good table.... Unfortunately, that was the end of all things 'good'.  Our starters were ok... The avocado was soggy and the shrimps were hardly there. In the entree, my Chicken with cashew nuts was burnt and the spices so horribly strong that it burnt my tongue. My sister's pasta was dry, a salmon order was almost raw. The only good and edible thing was the cheese pizza for the kids.. Which apparently they had burnt and had to remake, thus delaying our food and making the other dishes cold.  For desserts, we ordered sundaes and a red velvet cheesecake and an original one. I was stunned to see the shrinkage in size...  Very disappointed this time.

Shannon D.,"Lexington, KY",5,72,38,1.0,10/8/2015,"We usually eat here any time that we're in Lexington (once a month at least), but after today we have serious doubts about returning.   The young lady at the hostess station was disinterested at best (more like just plain rude).  After waiting about 15 minutes and then called up to be seated, we were told to wait again.   When the woman finally came to seat us, she instead took another party of two to their table (and who signed in long after we did).   We finally get seated and think that the worst is over, but we were wrong.  It took almost 30 minutes to get our food, and while we were eating we watched the busboy clean and reassemble the little tiny table RIGHT next to us.  Instead of gripping the silverware by the stems, he had his hands ALL OVER the parts that go into customers' mouths - ALL OVER them.  At that point, my husband and I just said a prayer that he hadn't been the one to assemble our table.   I actually went to speak to the manager about it, and although she seemed to be very concerned, I was appalled when I returned to the table after using the restroom only to find out that they seated two unsuspecting customers without ever removing the nasty silverware that the busboy had handled like a barbarian.  Epic fail on management's part.  We felt compelled to warn the women, who immediately asked for brand new and unfingered utensils.   We thought about ordering cheesecake to go (so we could use our own clean silverware), but after waiting another 15-20 minutes after finishing our meal without being offered either a dessert menu or our check, we were just thoroughly disappointed with the overall experience and decided that it was time to go.   As of right now, I doubt that we will return to this location any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=40

Katherine H.,"Lexington, KY",0,3,,3.0,8/14/2017,"Really enjoy the cheesecake, some of the best I've had. We can't afford it often, so it's a really special treat for us to just get some cheesecake to go. Went in last Saturday evening, and ordered two pieces of cheesecake in the to-go line. One of the Coffee and Cream Cheesecake, and one of the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Coffee for husband, and white chocolate for me. His was awesome, however, when I got to mine I noticed it was sort of short, if that makes sense. I took a bite, and realized there was no crust in that bite. (LOVE the chocolate cookie crust, makes the cheesecake a little less rich). Took another bite, and didn't have any crust in it... so I lifted the whole piece up and realized there was no crust until you got to the back of the cheesecake- like someone had lifted it and the bottom hadn't come with it. That's not a huge deal- but when you're spending $8 on a piece of cheesecake that you allow yourself once or twice a year, it was super disappointing. Had already been out all day and didn't feel like being that girl to bring back a half-eaten piece of cheesecake for a possible refund.

Laurie A.,"Lexington, KY",11,19,59,5.0,10/24/2014,"Finally, Lexington has a Cheesecake Factory!  If you've ever been to the CcF you know how amazing it is. Do I even need to write a review?? I went on one of the training days and even though cooks, bussers, and wait staff were practicing it was the same service and quality that I have come to expect from the CcF.  If you haven't been to a CcF then what are you waiting for? I recommend perusing the menu online beforehand as it is quite extensive. If you're a party of two I would say expect to spend around $50, more if you order drinks, etc. I'd say our average bill is around $75 whenever we go, which wasn't often. Until now! The ambiance is nice, with low light, and even though the place is usually packed with people it somehow doesn't feel crowded. Portion sizes are generous and more than likely you'll be bringing leftovers home with you.  Favorite app: Tex Mex egg rolls. Favorite entrees: Miso Salmon and Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Favorite Cheesecake: Red Velvet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=40

No other cheesecake they have exists to me. I dream about this cheesecake!  The best thing I've had from the dinner menu is probably the Louisiana something Pasta. They have great pasta!  The garlic noodles are also good. The atmosphere can be a bit chaotic at times and I wish it were a little darker.

Their menu is incredible and will take you a while to look through it and decide on your meal. It took quite a while for our waitress to come and get our order but in all honesty, I was kind of glad because I had such a hard time deciding what I wanted. Now, if you already knew what you wanted and had to wait that long it would get really frustrating. Perfect for the indecisive crowd like me though! :)  I like the atmosphere/ambiance of the Cheesecake Factory and an never displeased with the food. I would recommend dining here if you have a little while and want a date night or a more drawn out meal.  As always, their dessert menu never fails! I will say, I was pretty disappointed last night when we went because I absolutely love the strawberry shortcake and of course they were out of biscuits :( I ended up getting the s'mores cheesecake which turned out to be amazing!

NONE!It was a syrupy mix with a slice of orange in it. The portion of guac and chips was large but had zero taste to it. I ate about 3 bits and quit, wasnt even worth chewing. The chips were to salty and hard as a rock. The one who ordered the steak tacos received chicken instead of steak, had to be replaced. The one with the steak medallions said her order was fine. The 6 year old was in tears when he saw what they considered to be a mini corn dog. There was no way any child could bite that monster of dough it was actually disgusting. So i figured we could at least get some cheesecake. Well mine was frozen in the middle. So i wasted $100 on a birthday dinner for my niece and will never do that again. Just bad food.

Adam F.,"Lexington, KY",1,9,16,3.0,5/23/2016,"Great food, fun atmosphere despite slightly high prices has made this franchise explode in popularity. My visit to this particular restaurant was no exception Our waitress was prompt and pleasant, she was answered all of our questions, which was helpful in making decision in the massive menu they offer.  I ordered a Ribeye steak, it was cooked perfectly and did not disappoint... It's not going to replace establishments that I have as my top steakhouses but it held it's own. The steak was complimented by mashed potatoes and French which were both well seasoned and tasted freshly prepared.  I ordered a Mai Tai with my meal which was overall good but was slightly too sweet for my tastes.   I concluded my meal with anniversary cheesecake that had layers of dense chocolate cake and original cheesecake garnished with chocolate mousse and some chocolate drizzle. I am big fan of traditional desserts and this is the perfect hybrid of an original cheesecake and a rich chocolate cake.  This restaurant has many bold flavors and could be overpowering to those who are more attracted to subtle tastes but all the dishes seemed to have good balances of different flavors. However, With that said, the size of the menu gives a good variety and does really have something for everyone.

Jamie M.,"Lexington, KY",124,212,407,5.0,12/3/2014,"I love the cheesecake factory and am so happy we finally got one in Lexington. I've been to the one in Louisville several times. It's usually always busy and some sort of wait so I knew this one would stay that way, not just because it was new, but because of my experience with the on in Louisville. That said, I do agree with others that this one is definitely smaller than the one in Louisville so that will probably cause it to have longer wait times. If you go in expecting the wait then there should be no reason to complain about it. It's a new restaurant and popular and will probably stay that way. Given this, the neat thing is instead of having to sit in the restaurant and wait, they can text you when your table is ready. If you plan around having to wait, you can do some window shopping or actual shopping in the mall and you don't feel like you've wasted your time.  My first visit was on a Saturday about two weeks or so ago. My mom and I were already at the mall early (10amish). We finished our shopping right about 11am so I said lets see how long the wait is. There was a line outside the door, but it was just about 11:05. I think they were trying to seat as they went at first and then decided to check people in and then seat to get the line outside moving. We had about 10-15 minute wait. They texted me when our seat was ready. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Brought the bread out with our drinks and even recommended when we received our meals to go ahead and order the cheesecake if we planned to do so that way we wouldn't have to wait very long for it. Great idea! I had the fish and chips and forgot to take a picture of it. The fish was really light and great flavor. It came with coleslaw and fries. I don't care for coleslaw so I didn't eat that and I failed to ask if I could switch it out with something else. My mom had one of the salads and it looked awesome. The menu can be overwhelming because they have so many options, but the portion sizes are plentiful and most will want a take home box. It is on the pricier side, but it's a great atmosphere. We split the pumpkin and pumpkin pecan cheesecake slice. Wow that was amazing. Like eating pumpkin pie and pecan pie all in one bite.

I ordered the basil pasta, and it was decent, but nothing to write home about. Sorta bland. Two people at our table ordered the chicken and biscuits, and they apparently didn't have any ready at the time and had to make (I guess from scratch, since it took so long!). When they finally did come out, they weren't even cooked completely and they had finished most of their meals. The manager gave us a couple of free pieces of cheesecake for the inconvenience, which was cool, but my boyfriend wasn't much impressed with his meal as it lacked gravy and veggies, which are important to the meal!  Appetizer - fried mac and cheese, was the bomb as always. And cheesecake, which we got to go, was of course good - they better not mess that up, right? The icing on the cake, I left my debit card, and when I called the next day they didn't have it (didn't use it anywhere else after that). Maybe it really was lost, but oh well.

Amy W.,"Lexington, KY",135,207,193,4.0,12/1/2014,"I have a major sweet tooth, so you know that a restaurant devoted to a rich and sugary dessert would earn my repeated patronage!  I have been to this location twice, but I keep forgetting to check in or take pictures.   The high ceilings, art deco lighting fixtures, and servers dressed in shirts and ties give the ambiance of a nice restaurant.  However, the crowds of people casually dressed reminds you that this is a restaurant attached to the mall.   Expect a long wait until everyone who lives in Fayette and the surrounding counties have had their chance to try it out.  The only upside to the long wait is the fact that you don't have to wait at the restaurant with a buzzer, but can roam the mall and you will receive a text when your table is ready. I have had the fettuccine alfredo at this location.  It was okay, but on the plain side.  On my second visit I had the Factory Nachos with spicy chicken as my entrée.  The portion is huge (like all portions at this chain) and delicious!  The tortilla chips are the real deal (made from tortillas cut up and fried it appears).  The flavors of all of the toppings were just incredible.  I love nachos and these have to be my favorite. As for the real reason why people visit this restaurant: the cheesecake is always perfect!  The first time I had the Snickers cheesecake.  It really tasted like a Snickers bar!  It had that salty peaunuty, chocolatey taste!  The flavor that I tried on my second visit was the S'more cheesecake.  The presentation was pleasing with melted marshmallows and graham crackers on top.  This is my favorite flavor yet.  I can't wait to go back and try the pineapple upside down cheesecake.   If you don't want to be eating the same leftovers for your next three meals then I would recommend stopping by and purchasing a slice of cheesecake without the hassle of waiting to dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=60

I asked the waitress a few questions and decided to go with a simple green appetizer salad, which she described as having mixed greens with a variety of veggies on top.  I was very surprised by the low quality of the ingredients, including the pale green lettuce with brown edges, tasteless tomatoes, waxy cucumbers, and stale croutons. The dynamite shrimp were also disappointing- extremely small shrimp made up mostly of tempura batter with a sauce that was not at all spicy. My son ordered the hanger steak and though it was missing the asparagus and had an overly sweet sauce he said it was good; I really don't know how they get away with charging $20 for it though, I expected more for the price. We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go, also very expensive @ $7.95, and it took a ridiculous amount of time for our server to bring it out. Overall, the quality of the food was low (especially for the prices), the service was average, the wait for our food (45 minutes!) was shockingly long, and the environment was no better than a casual restaurant. I don't understand the popularity of the place...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=60

Food was good, I had shepherds pie and we shared lettuce wraps. Service was inconsistent, we had one server who then introduced us to another man who supposedly was helping take care of us, then the female server disappeared for 20 minutes... a little confusing, the food was slow to arrive for lunch service standards, but it is a new restaurant.

The server never said she was sorry and when I asked her about it, she said it was coming. It did not. My family was finished eating and I still had not gotten my omlette. I went to the hostess stand and asked for the manager. It still took 10 minutes more to get an omlette. Meanwhile the setver is asking about dessert.

I went at 11am so it wasnt crowded yet the staff was friendly and helpful. I knew what I wanted already so no searching through their huge menu. I got the shepherds pie the dinner portion and it was huge enough for two meals and I took half home including the fresh hot bread six pieces of french white and oat wheat which was really good also. Cons were the wait on the food since they werent busy and what I ordered was one of their specialties also I noticed other customers getting tired of the wait.

The Cheesecake display was awesome to look at but way to expensive to buy. One would cost from $30 and up. A slice of any of the 30 choices to choice from was $7.95. They had huge menu and in my opinion to many options to pick from. I had the Renee Special which was a turkey sandwich  and a side salad, cream corn soup. This was a huge amount of food for $11. Ice tea cost me $2.95. I choice the Dutch apple and pecan cheesecake huge slice.They even had gluten free section, a skinny selection and breakfeast selection. There was an open bar as well.

Greg K.,"Winchester, KY",14,63,42,3.0,11/16/2014,"Let me start with this. There was 8 of us on a Saturday evening. We got there at 4:52p per the ticket we were given to wait for our table. On the ticket it said 2.5 to 3 hours wait. That was fine. We had shopping to do. They text you when your table is ready which is nice. You have 10 minutes to get back to claim your table. Well 7:52p came around and no text. I went and asked at the hostess stand. They said the times were wrong on the ticket I got. It should've said 3 to 3.5 hours, so they scratched it out and said we'll need to wait. I was not happy. I found a manager and explained what I had been through. He was apologetic and told me we'd be next. Well we weren't. About 35 minutes later we got a table. We sat down around 8:35p. Once we sat down the service was great and so was the food. Make sure when you get there you get the correct wait times written on your ticket otherwise you'll be disappointed like we were. We would've left but everywhere else we called had a 35 to 40 minute wait. That was at 8p.  Bottom line...  Would we go here again?  Yes.

One was even in a different state. Is that why the Big Bang Theory always jokes about how Penny is such a bad waitress? Maybe her poor waitressing maintains TCF brand?? First off, Our waiter apparently didn't think our party needed silverware & plates (although we had bread). By the time he discovered we needed silverware (he had to be told), he apparently disagreed we needed plates. He was asked to get these as well but just never got them. We had to flag down a random waiter to get plates. Our own waiter never acknowledged how we magically got plates placed on our table lol. On the plus side, the food was great for the most part. We went to Happy Hour on a Friday and I can now say that I'm obsessed with the Buffalo Blasts....they were perfectly crispy & honestly the best thing I've eaten all month. The Fried Mac & Cheese was also a big hit with the table. We also got free nachos, due to suspiciously soupy crab & artichoke dip we sent back & our waiter bringing out an incorrect appetizer (just roasted artichokes), which were amazing as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=100

She never came back out to check if our food was right or good and honestly it wasn't. I got the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was really bad. I've had it before and it was always great before but last night it tasted watery and bland. The chicken was tough and the meal was just not great. When my dinner companion asked for more water, since the server hadn't shown up from the time she took our order till the food was dropped, she asked for my more water and the server literally responded, ""please and thank you"" in the nastiest tone. The child at our table wanted to substitute carrots with his salmon kids meal. The server acted like this was extremely inconvenient and when the food came out she carelessly mentioned that the carrots would be out soon. For some reason I received my food about 6 minutes before anyone else was served. There was no manager walking around to check if we were okay, which is kinda strange for a restaurant.

Robert E.,"Lexington, KY",38,6,,2.0,4/6/2016,"This is a review of my first visit to this location which occurred Thursday, March 31. Having gone to several CCF's around the country I had certain expectations. Quality in nearly all facets has been relatively uniform and above average. However my experience today, whole possibly an outlier, was disappointing. The lunch I ordered was served with what was essentially raw chicken on top. When I brought this to my servers attention she promptly said that she would replace my meal and send the manager over to speak with us about the inadequacy of the meal. After a very lengthy time the replacement meal was brought by another server. This was thankfully cooked, yet we never saw a manager and our initial server was avoiding our table. Later after trying for a while to get the check we finally got our servers attention and she brought the check. A manager was never sent over, nor we were offered anything for our lost time and inconvenience in waiting for a new meal to come out. This was very poorly handled and with a little initiative on the part of the server or the manager she supposedly informed this review could have been avoided.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=80

I don't like having to read more than a couple pages to figure out what I'm going to eat.  I've had better cheesecake. Perhaps the specialty flavors are better than the plain with strawberries? You can buy an entire cheesecake at the Fresh Market for the price of their one-slice. Our wait-staff were friendly. The music too loud and not to my taste. Surprise of the meal: the Mojito. I generally don't like them but this one had a fun twist, pineapple. It turned out to be excellent. Kudos to the bar tender! I may go back to try a specialty cheesecake for a special occasion but I can't justify the cost. I'd rather go to Malones to spend that kind of money in Lexington. No pictures from me on this review.

Shelly P.,"Washington, DC",3,29,6,3.0,11/25/2014,"Cheesecake Factory (CF)...what were you thinking when you created your chain's smallest restaurant in Lexington, KY at Fayette Mall?  If square footage of available space was an issue, you could have easily made it two stories, but as it stands now, the minimal seating offered isn't half as large as it needs to be. Ahem.   Excellent hosts/hostesses and the waitstaff are very friendly and helpful.  The food is standard for the chain and as always, their cheesecakes out of this world.  However, our family of 4 waited an hour and a half for a table on a Tuesday.  I want to be clear however, this is not the fault of anyone working there--it's the fault of the Cheesecake Factory company for thinking that tiny space was sufficient for a city with a population of this size.   Luckily-- you have the option of roaming the mall as you wait; so my advice is to come early, put down you name, and then do some shopping.  They take your cell number and send you a text message when your table is ready, so you can wander away from the restaurant premises.

Will R.,"Lexington, KY",0,3,,3.0,5/15/2016,"when i called the cheesecake factory to make a reservation, they told me that i didn't need a reservation as there was not alot of customers at the moment, but when i arrived i had to wait 45 minutes before i got a seat. other than that i thought the food was great if not a bit too expensive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=80

Jared S.,"Richmond, KY",3,22,6,2.0,12/19/2014,"Stopped in for my first time here to have lunch. It was moderately busy but it is Christmas time. Seated in 10 minutes which was great but it took the server 10 minutes to get to us to get a drink order and another 7 minutes to receive it and 20 minutes to just get drinks is really too much for me to deal with especially since the server Tyra C. Had only 3 tables. Refills were a pain to get and had to flag other servers down, once the food arrived at our table our server never check on us to ask us how it was or if anything was wrong which would have been nice since I needed ketchup and my girlfriend had already finished her meal by the time I finally got our server to bring it to our table. The food was great which is why I at least gave it 2 stars. Hopefully if I come back I can get a better server which will increase my star rating of this establishment",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lexington-2?start=80
