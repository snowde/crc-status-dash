Jt P.,"Westerville, OH",20,113,105,4.0,2/15/2017,"This is not my first encounter with TCF. I usually am not a huge fan of anything but the Cheesecake, but had a meeting at work that drug me here.  The food although hit or miss has always seemed very overpriced. The noodles I had inside my Chicken Carbonara were overcooked a bit, but they were insanely busy. Kinda expected.  Very loud and the lights were a bit too dark. For some reason 3/4 of the way through dinner the sound on the music went up about double of what it was.... not sure why. The waiting area / or lack there of - making everyone crowd close to cheesecake counter or inside the foyer was extremely warm. The bartender knows how to make a good Long Island though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=20
Michelle N.,"Mundelein, IL",38,71,71,2.0,2/12/2017,"Honestly I haven't been here for over 4years... until last night. I used to frequent this location with my parents and it was always something I looked forward to. The cheesecake, atmosphere and other food delights. Last night was most definitely sub par to that. I went with my fiancé at 4pm. We were seated within 3 mins of entering (not upset about that at all). The waiter comes over introduces himself takes the drink order and maybe 10 minutes later returns with the drinks and bread. Another 10 mins goes by. Takes the appetizer order and we can't seem to find the waiter for another 15 to place our entree orders. When the waiter comes back he bumps into my chair , while talking to the table next to us and totally ignores us behind him. I flagged him down while walking by again and he took our entree orders. About 20 mins later the waiter comes back and tells us shift has ended and introduces us to his cover. Now , by this time the restaurant has gotten quite busy because of dinner hour and valentines  day being so close. The new waiter-cover comes back 10 mins later and tells us the food will be out in 5 mins. 10 mins go by and the food finally comes. By this point I'm frustrated and just want to take my food to go and order some cheesecake to go. I couldn't even find the the waiter in our area for another 5 mins. He got us a cheesecake menu , we ordered on the spit then he proceeded for the next 10 mins to come back and forth randomly to tell us the counter was too busy to get the cake. So I asked for the check and we paid. As soon as that check came out you better get the waiter was hanging around more often. We finally got the cake and navigated our way through the sea of people blocking the entrance/exit.  In short, I will not be returning to this location ever again. Thanks for ruining our Valentine's Day dinner for us :( Edited: I have been contacted by Cheesecake Factory. Issue has been taken care of for now. I will still never visit this location again. Maybe northbrook or Schaumburg someday. Not anytime soon as I am still sore about this place. Thank you",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=20
Anusha J.,"Gurnee, IL",74,4,1,4.0,3/18/2017,"The aesthetic is great, very calm yet lively atmosphere. The menu is extensive, and even as a vegan I could find options to eat (I ordered the Mexican Taco Salad without sour cream, meat, or cheese and it was nice to be able to eat a meal that wasn't lettuce greens and tomato slices). However, the waitress I was with wasn't vey informed on veganism and first told me I could order the eggplant parmesean without parmesean (but still brought it with cheese), and struggled to order the Taco Salad vegan style. Great service regardless though, and the view outside is stunning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=20
Lawrence S.,"Glenview, IL",0,1,,1.0,9/11/2017,"Once when you ordered chocolate cake ""to go"" it was placed in a large flat plastic container. The cake would lay on its side next to the dollop of whip cream and when you were ready to eat it, there it was in one piece ready to enjoy! Now, they cram the large piece of chocolate cake into the same plastic containers they use for the much smaller slices of cheesecake. The result is the top layer of frosting is plastered to the inside roof of the container and when you open it, the frosting is peeled from the top layer of the cake. It seems like a small issue but when you pay $9.00 for a slice it would be nice to have it intact and in one piece rather than the sticky mess I'm looking at now Go back to the large trays you used before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=20
Melanie L.,"Murrieta, CA",2,24,1,2.0,8/11/2017,The food was horrible.  Two salads were soggy from the dressing and they put tostadas and chicken under the salad so you have to dig for it like a treasure hunt.  My kids wouldn't even eat their corn dogs and fried shrimp because it was 90% breaking and 10% meat.  I give two stars for decor and great Cheesecake!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=20

Open and airy restaurant with outside seating options for good weather days.  Service was prompt and courteous.  Our order took a bit longer than expected, but arrived piping hot.  I enjoyed the shrimp tacos, my wife the Jamaican shrimp and our kids had fettuccine Alfredo and the kids chicken platter.  Also my portion was small enough that I was the only one to finish, everyone else took the remainder home along with 2 slices of cake and 1 cheesecake to share.

We were supposed to get seated quickly on the patio. Waited 10 minutes, asked whats going on. Should be 5 more minutes. 10 minutes later I asked again how much longer and why we're not getting seated on an empty patio - all tables are dirty,  waiting on a busboy to clean one.

Vilmos ..,"Abingdon, IL",3,27,3,4.0,2/13/2017,"This was my first experience with The Cheesecake Factory. It was Saturday lunch and we came in around noon and were seated immediately even thought it appeared to be very full. As it turned out when we left there was a long waiting line so we must have come in just in time. It took about an hour and a half from start to finish.  The facility is very elegant. Very high ceilings with great decoration. Aside from making me feel like I was in a very large room, it also helped keep the sounds around us down.  While our service was good I felt it was a little slow which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. This is not to say that our server did not do a good job, she checked in with us in a regular basis but the flow of the food was slow. We found ourselves waiting for the next item a little too long.  The food was good and the menu extremely large. I ended up choosing one of the featured items because there were so many choices I got tired flipping through the enemy ""book."". The final cost was a little more that I would normally pay but overall it was a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=20

We saw her standing through the door looking at us for a good two minutes before she walked up, without introducing herself, and blatantly stated ""what can I get for you to drink"". Her attire was messy and stained and her shirt was dirty and half-tucked in, which from the start gave a bad impression. She seemed completely annoyed to be serving us.

Rakesh R.,"Binghamton, NY",21,7,,4.0,12/21/2016,We went here for a team lunch. These are the pros and cons about this restaurant. Pros: The ambience here was very good.  When comes to the service it was good but it was hard to understand the waiter.  One thing you should definitely visit this restaurant because they have huge number of cheesecake varieties as well as the entrees. Cons: The item in the menu said very spicy but actually when you get it was very sweet. The item I ordered was very *spicy cashew chicken* over brown rice. The sauce on the chicken was too sweet and was hard to eat.  Overall the experience here was quite good (although I was disappointed with the entree). I would rate this as a good restaurant you can visit with your friends and family.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=20

Sung Y.,"Bloomingdale, IL",15,107,174,2.0,7/19/2015,Let me preface this by saying we love the Cheesecake Factory and have been to many many locations throughout the U.S. This by far was one of the worst experiences. It started off by taking forever to get our drinks and take our order. When our appetizer came out our server did not brink any small appetizer plates. Also I wanted to order the chicken and biscuits but after ordering was told they were out? Seriously I thought that was one of their more popular dishes?

Michelle F.,"Schaumburg, IL",174,722,1961,4.0,8/31/2012,"I have been to a couple other cheesecake factories in the past, but this one is one of the best!! The only downside to the menu is the size of the menu.  It's a great problem to have, really, but it makes it really hard to narrow down what you want to eat when you're starving and looking at the menu. I know, I know.  First world problems... We were seated right away on a Thursday evening--we had the choice of indoor or outdoor.  We chose outdoor because we know our days of outdoor seating are limited ::cue the waterworks:: It took a little while for our waiter to notice we were there, but from then on out, he was extremely attentive and great.  He brought us everything we needed in a timely fashion, and he was really on top of things.  Oh, and the complimentary bread was so fresh, crispy, and HOT.  Loved it. So in order to streamline our ordering, we decided to look off of the skinny menu.  It's a pretty comprehensive menu in itself!  We ordered the mexican ""tacos"" as an appetizer.  They were actually Mexican lettuce wraps, and you didn't even miss the tortilla, quite honestly!  It had just the right amount of spice and flavor.  YUM! For my meal, I got the turkey burger, no mayo (but when it came with mayo, it was rectified right away--they were really on top of it) and it comes with a side salad.  This is my kind of meal!! Dessert time came, and of COURSE we each got one!  My friend got the Key Lime Cheesecake, and me--not being a cheesecake fan ::ducks from flying objects::--got the Blackout Cake.  Trust me, it doesn't leave you missing cheesecake FOR SURE.  It was CRAZY good.  But I did have some Key Lime Cheesecake, and it didn't suck.  It's still not my favorite, but I would take chocolate ANY day :) I will definitely be back for the wonderful food, great service, and delectable desserts! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=100
Andrew M.,"Palatine, IL",32,208,12,4.0,5/10/2013,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory numerous times. Last night I had dinner here. The wait wasn't too long, which is unusual for Cheesecake Factory, and our service was good.  The menu is, in my opinion, too big for its own good; but they don't sacrifice quality. I have had a variety of dishes, and I have only been disappointed with the tacos. Things I have enjoyed include the chicken littles, jambalaya, quesadillas, etc. The only bad part is that the serving sizes are outrageous. I usually finish my meal, but I have no room left over for cheesecake.  When I do have room for cheesecake, my personal favorite is the Reese's Peanut butter cup cheesecake. If you aren't salivating over the thought of eating this, you're wrong.

I paid over $70 for the guacamole, fried mac n cheese balls, chicken teriyaki & chicken chipotle pasta. The guacamole was unsalted and no lime juice. The Mac n Cheese was okay. My teriyaki dish was horrible & my husbands pasta had one piece of chicken and 2 piece asparagus in it. Pasta was good!  My hubby complained about his dish and offered him extra chicken to go.

Katie S.,"Kenosha, WI",0,6,,3.0,11/12/2016,"A few friends and I decided to come for a late dinner tonight and weren't as satisfied as we'd wished after leaving. We ordered 2 entrees which were split between us, and Cheesecake to go. Could have been better service but we understand it's a busy establishment on a Saturday night, not a big deal. When we asked our check to be split a certain way, it came back half right. We sent it back to be corrected and run the payment through right away. We came back and more of our checks were incorrectly switched, but the cards had already been run through so there was no point in correcting a second time. I was charged for all 4 pieces of cheesecake I ordered but as soon as I got home I noticed our server had only given me 3. I wouldn't mind so much if it was my own piece and I didn't pay $8-$9 for a single slice of cheesecake but I'm disappointed not only by our so-so service, but being jipped out money and my friends partially paying for my meal when it wasn't intended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=100

We were offered drink refills frequently and our table was cleared of dirty dishes frequently as well. Prices are reasonable too. My wife and I started off with the ""Vietnamese Tacos"", which is a bit of a misnomer.  These were steamed buns filled with pork and pickled veggies.  They were trying to be cute with the name, but to call it a ""taco"" is a bit misleading IMHO.  Our main courses consisted of the Factory Chopped Salad for me, and grilled Salmon for the Mrs.  Hers came with a side of pasta.  Mine was a hearty blend of lettuce, corn, veggies, and roasted chicken.  It was very good.

The only thing I could say I really love there, are the desserts :) I've had the shepards pie and I've had their steak. Both were good, especially I liked the mashed potatoes (real potatoes not that powder crap). Their carrot cake is top notch, creamy, yummy moose on top, not too sweet. Ive tried some of their cheesecakes, all of them were good. Im usually not a fan of cheesecakes, but these were pretty darn good. Its a fancier restaurant that somehow turned into a more casual restaurant. The menu is insanely long, has something for everyone. If you have a special occasion I could recommend cheesecake factory, however, they do not take reservations and the waiting time is often up to 2 hours on weekend nights. Week nights I have never experienced a wait. It does take forever to get your main dish, come here only when you have about half an hour to get your main dish even on a slow night.

Chris J.,"Chicago, IL",123,10,5,2.0,8/2/2012,"Good:  we were seated very quickly on the outside patio even though there was a line of people waiting.  I guess they wanted inside seats.  The view is nice and the weather was great.  A few ducks were hustling for hand-outs which wasn't bad.  Kinda funny seeing them waddle around. Meh; our waiter was a guy that kinda looked like ManCow Muller.  Hmm....anyway, we ordered the passion fruit tea and it was horrible.  He immediately asked ""Too perfumey?"" like he knew it wasn't that great.  We changed that for regular tea but they don't have any sweet tea or raspberry.  We asked for sugar, which he never brought over.  A different waitress got it for us. The food was good and we had to take 'to go' boxes.  My problem though, is that the guy never came back around to check on us.  I had to flag him down after the busboy cleared the table.  We ordered desserts to go.   Bill came to $60 which wasn't bad but, gotta pay attention to your customers.  And lose that passion tea.  Yuk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=140

Yer X.,"Chicago, IL",6,8,,4.0,8/5/2013,"Yesterday my fiance and I came to try out Cheesecake for the first time--me that is, and few times for him. The introductory of the desserts fascinate me, therefore I decided we should dine here for the evening and call it a day. Upon reaching inside the restaurant, we were party of two and had a decision either dine in or outside. The inside was twenty minutes, which I should of have patience of waiting for it, but we went outside instead. Outside is a rather refreshing news to me, however, I suffered a migraine headache so there is no fault at anywhere but my own. At this time of the day, the wind still out there blowing people's leg like a snake. The breeze chills me, but like in ten minutes there were those lamp heaters to protect me from it. That's even greater. However, next time I dine here I will wait for the inside than the outside. Sorry love! Our server was nice, but she didn't tell me anything about the Orange Juice cannot be refilled. My fiance hasn't been here for such a long time he doesn't know what changed or not. So I ordered that and was told perhaps like twenty-thirty minutes after we got our dinner that it's nonrefillable. How unfortunate, but the good thing is that I drunk so many before I left, why need to drink more Vitamin C? Water was great to my dinner plus anyways. So onwards with dinner, we ordered two appetizers; Buffalo Wings and some fries that is actually creamy fried-breaded mozzarella sticks. The Buffalo Wings is perfect amount not to get full so fast of, and is easily devour than it can be in Miller Pub. Miller Pub has so much sauce their wings, I can easily contrast Cheesecake Factory's wings better. My fiance likes his appetizer, therefore we were more than satisfied. Then, we ordered our dinner. I ordered the Steakhouse BBQ burger and asked it for well done. My fiance ordered a five-cheese pasta and was arrived later than twenty-thirty minutes after we finished eating our appetizers. My husband's came first. He adored his too much he said, ""It's GG for me!"". I laughed. Now we waited for mines only in five minutes just to find out it's still rare. We asked our server to return it for well-done, leaving me the fries temporarily. Twenty minutes later, my burger returned to me and was cooked well. Sadly, I was  quite disappointed that moment I only ate half of my burger and took it home. We ordered three desserts! We can't say much about the Tiramisu and Reese's Peanut Butter cheesecake yet cause..~ It's in our fridge! But we ordered a strawberry Cheesecake, the classic, and it. WAS. THE. BEST.  My fiance almost passed out from the deliciousness of it to his mouth. It exploded with its originality I loved from it in my mouth, and will definitely come back to get one more before I leave back home! Yummy!! So the only reason I give it four was because the server could of told me more exact about the Orange Juice a nonrefillable juice, otherwise it'd be perfect. Another point is that my disappointment of my burger. Couldn't get comfortable after finding out its rare. Nothing bad, but I did request it and I have to wait another twenty minutes just to have it in my hands only to pack half of it home. It's a definite must try! Once again I must come back again before I leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=140

Every cheesecake restaurant I go to usually wait for seating and service. The food has generous portions for the price. Tasty foods full of flavor usually at every restaurant. All of the entrees are tasty and generous portions. My favorite is the Jumbalaya Linguini Pasta with chicken and shrimp. It is spicy with Cajun flavors. The bang bang chicken and shrimp is great that has a Thai peanut sauce with rice. Also, They have a special menu for the healthy eater. Every restaurant no matter the location has the same feel of relaxation in the restaurant where you can relax and unwind with your friends there. They accommodate large groups but mainly booths of six people are common. They are the best with many assortment of cheesecake. All of them taste so good!

Carol H.,"Newport News, VA",29,44,13,3.0,2/14/2010,"I have been to this location several times, and each time I have had an enjoyable experience. It is a chain restaurant so by nature its a bit lack luster, but its a great place to go to feed a crowd. I will write my review for my most recent visit. My husband, three children and I went to The Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. When we arrived we were seated promptly and right away asked what we would like to drink. Our server was courteous and prompt. He made sure our drinks were topped off and was very friendly towards the children.  As an appetizer we ordered the Lettuce Wraps. They were delicious, but they only gave us enough chicken to make three small wrap. The cashew sauce that was served with them was so yummy I was dipping the leftover lettuce in it and truly enjoying it. For the main course I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. I have ordered this before and liked it but this time it was only okay. It seemed to be overly sweet with no spice. Its a curry based dish, and I was told it should have a little kick to it- it didn't. I had a lot leftover to take home, and when I reheated it to eat it tasted much better.  My husband ordered from the specials menu and got a gumbo with shrimp and he really liked it. To me, it was rather bland. Not at all like the yummy goodness that you would expect from gumbo. My kids ordered the Orange Chicken, and shared the huge helping. They almost nearly cleaned their plates so I guess they loved their food. We took home the Carmel La Leche cheesecake, and it was superb. Just thinking about it makes me craving more. All in all, The Cheesecake Factory is a good place to grab a bite to eat, but be sure to save room for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=140

Gee M.,"Vernon Hills, IL",0,7,,4.0,8/17/2012,"I don't usually rave about chain restaurants but the food here is to die for! They start you off with two kinds of bread, a slice of french baguette and this dark whole wheat one (or maybe pumpernickel?). I ignore the white one and savor the dark bread. I don't exactly know what it is but it's crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, a bit warm that the butter just melts smoothly, a bit sweet but not too sweet, and has that whole wheat texture to it. AHHH just writing about it makes me drool. Then comes the appetizers. I don't usually get any appetizers because the plat principal is usually more than enough. I usually get either an avocado roll, Evelyn's favorite, or Roasted Veggies pizza. I believe these are vegetarian so if you are one, try these. If you love goat cheese as much as I do, the pizza is amazing. Then, dessert. Now, I'm one of those people who like their chocolate really dark and I'm afraid their cheesecakes, even the dark chocolate one, is just too sweet for my liking. I have tasted the dark chocolate one and the tiramisu cheesecake and normal people might like them. So, food is amazing. Location is wonderful. The patio overlooks a pond. Service can be better.

Frank L.,"Chicago, IL",58,117,5,4.0,5/11/2010,"This review of Cheesecake Factory may be a little unnecessary, because everyone knows what Cheesecake has to offer, but I'm here to highlight some of the other aspects of this Cheesecake Factory that may go unnoticed in the day to day dining experince at Cheesecake Factory.  1. The host was very good. I mentioned to the host that my party had not completely arrived, and I was hoping to put my name down to wait for my party to arrive. The host asked how long my party would be, gave me a buzer and said they would seat ME as soon as a table opened up. Granted it was 8:15pm, on a friday night and things were slowing somewhat, but I've only ever experienced long waits at Cheesecake, so this was a pleasant surprise as I waited for my co-diners. Two thumbs up to Cheesecake policy and the host.  2. Red velvet Cheesevake. When I was in Seattle a few months ago, myself and my two friemds bought an entire 7"" cheesecake for ourselves. It was cheesecake for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. By the end of the weekend, we were a little cheesecaked out. But on this last dine-in, three of us shared one slice, and it was as good as ever. If you haven't tried the Red velvet Cheesecake, and you're comfortable with rich, sugary and fattening, then you need to try this IMMEDIATELY! STOP READING THIS AND PICK UP A SLICE! CHEESECAKE FACTORY IS EVERYWHERE.  3. Servers. Could actually be accused of being ""too friendly"". But is this a bad thing? Give me the exhuberent and kill-you-with-kindness energy over the ""what the hell do you want attitude"" and you've got my repeat business.  4. Menu. This is also something that could be considered a negative, because there is almost TOO MUCH to choose from. But this last trip in, I tried something new, something I never. Thought I would order (crispy spicy beef) and I found myself trying to stuff every last bit of crispy beef, rice and veggies into my piehole despite my stomach telling me ""no stop. No more food"". Use the expansive menu to your advantage! Try something different because you may be pleasantly surprised.  5. The bread. I am a sucker for their dark sweet wheat bread. Or is it rye? Who knows, who cares. Just give me lots of it. Especially when its warm and right out of the oven. We were at Cheesecake a few months ago and it was late, but our server brought out fresh bread for us anyways. Another notch in the belt of superior customer service.  To recap and advise: Check out Cheesecake Factory for: Incredible red velvet cheesecake.  Great service. Top to bottom.  Expansive menu - that should satisfy even the pickiest eaters.  Some words of caution: Be prepared for a long wait.  The food portions are large, so those watching their figure should take heed (and maybe skip the cheesecake)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=180

My husband then goes inside to see what is going on and doesn't return for another 15 to 20 minutes. That is because he has to wait in line at the bakery where people are ordering Cheesecake while our order is sitting on the counter right behind the cashier.

E M.,"Mundelein, IL",0,31,3,3.0,2/19/2012,"Let me start off by saying that on Yelp, three stars is ""A-OK."" For me, it's more like, ""Ehhhh...it was okay.""   Secondly, I am truly befuddled by the people that pack these places every night, and all I can think of is that they are the same relatively small cross-section of the populations that come over and over again -- unimaginative, chain-restaurant dwellers.  This place's biggest appeal in their food is that most of the dishes are comfort food with lots of ingredients, which definitely makes people feel like they are getting their money's worth.  (??)  Sorry, but an over-over-sized bowl of mushy noodles with red AND yellow peppers AND three kinds of cheese instead of one is not worth my $17.00.  I've probably been to various Cheesecake Factories in the area a total of ten times over the the years; after a many-year hiatus, we went to the one in Lincolnshire to meet a friend and had the same ""why did we come here?"" experience as always.  Let's start with the food, which was okay, and go one to the service, which was dismal.  The bread they bring to the table was actually fantastic...yippee!  As we wrestled through the ridiculously long menu, we had an order of chips with spinach dip, which was fine, but what wouldn't be with mounds of cheese and oil literally floating on top? I'm a rich-food junkie, but this was too much even for me.  Also had the chicken croquettes which were fried balls of mush. Again, I can see where someone who had never ventured to a (*gasp!*) real ethnic restaurant, such as Cuban or Spanish, might think this was a passable example of that dish.  However, we are talking about a chain restaurant in ""the soul-less suburbs,"" so I guess I have to adjust my thinking for that.  Next up was my Louisiana pasta dish.  I pretty much ordered exactly the kind of dish I associate with this place -- an inventive (lots of ingredients!!!) rich dish that was executed at about 65%.  The chicken was thin and tender, but heavily breaded. The bow tie pasta was alright but overcooked and had almost no sauce on it -- it was quite unexpectedly dry (but hey...on the menu it listed lots of ingredients!!!!)   Also at the table was a chicken club, a burger, pasta with meat sauce, chicken tenders, and the romano chicken.  Out of the six of us, three liked their dish, and three didn't.  The cheesecake was, I guess, as good or bad as one makes it.  In other words, it looks fantastic, they have every combo of cheesecake under the sun, and it's all rich and smack-you-over the head sweet, but in varying degrees. You should order as over the top as you think you can handle....I got carried away and ordered too far over the top (Dulce de Leche.)  I really liked my husband's Original, and if there was a next time, I'd probably get the Cherry cheesecake.  Now, the service.  The list is long but somewhat entertaining in a sad way, so read on.  At least if you stick with my review, you can come out of it feeling good that at least it happened to me and not you (hopefully.)  This place HAS to have a high turnover -- no one looks happy or like they know what's going on.  Our waiter was the type that makes me want to go back later and smack once I think about how bad he was, especially considering he added our 18% tip in automatically.  My friend (a very apologetic person by nature) had to screech at him three separate times for new (alcoholic, i.e., expensive, i.e. more money for the restaurant and waiter) drinks as he whizzed by without a glance.  He took my daughter's water glass away for some reason while we were in the bathroom, and later when she wanted water I asked where her glass went and my husband said ""the waiter spilled it in my lap.""  Huh?? Was he picking it up to take away, or to refill? We don't know, but after he disposed of it on my husband, he never came back with another.  When I told him we all wanted waters (they had all disappeared) he said ""How many?""  Umm....we ALL want them.  All means ALL.  Waters all around.  Ten minutes later, he comes back -- one water short.  Now, you may think I'm picking on our poor guy, but no....there are many more people that can share the blame on this one!  Ever heard of the phrase ""Ship of fools?""  Read on to the next review, as 5000 characters can't do this place justice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=180

Johnny B.,"Austin, TX",3,93,,4.0,3/31/2012,"My 1st time at The Cheesecake Factory. I've never been to Hooters either, but driving up to this place, I thought I was in Las Vegas. The place looked like the Taj Mahal. As I entered, it was like a Taj Mahal inside! Tell me they ain't making $$$$. I also didn't know they had  free standing restaurants. Had a short wait as we got there b4 6:00. That seems to be the breaking point. Sat at a table with a beautiful view. Ordered an appetizer of Tahini. Great choice. Very fresh and garlicky. Sweet. My companion ordered a huge salad. She is on a diet again! I had the Americana Burger. Great toasted bun with all the fillings (onion, tomato lettuce, 1000 island dressing). Fries accompany the burger. BUT, the reason I came- DESSERT!!!!! I had the white choc, macadamia nut, caramel cheesecake. WOW! Oh, do not forget the whipped cream liberally used for the topping. GREAT.  All in all, good circus, good service, good food and GREAT DESSERTS. Will return after my diet! Johnny Chitown",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=180

I certainly prefer this location over the Skokie one as it offers a really nice outdoor patio in the back with a view of a man-made lake with quite a bit of wildlife.  The patio in the summer is a great place to enjoy a Sunday brunch or have a nice evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=180

Some of the worst service I have ever witnessed. Took about 35 min just to get bread and water on the table. Really disappointed because this chain is usually pretty good and had good times before.

Rachel H.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",57,138,43,4.0,11/16/2008,"I have been to the Lincolnshire location a few times, I usually frequent the Old Orchard location  as I work a few minutes away from there. I was introduced to the Avacado rolls by my co workers, I fell in love... with the rolls, not the co workers. The roll itself is hot ( as in temperature)and crispy, the filling is cold creamy avacado. Its like a mini explosion when you take the first bite. I usually dunk my roll in the sauce and pop it in and savor the magnafico taste! Fish taco are very good, I can never finish the entire plate,it is a lot of food. I once ordered the Chicken pot pie..It is HUGE! I was a bit disappointed I couldn't finish all of the pastry. The Cheesecakes Rock! In my quest to taste ALL the flavors, I have tried quite a few. Including the low carb....yes I go on a crash diet at times. I cannot tell you which one is my favorite, I fall hopelessly in love with every slice. I usually get the Pumpkin cheesecake during Nov-Dec. ,it is a seasonal item, you should try it if you get a chance.

J W.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,65,,3.0,3/18/2012,Love the ambience. Its so pretty in there. And of course the desserts are delicious. But the rest is just ok. We went to the bar to get some drinks first because we had to wait 30 minutes for a table. Which is the minimum for a saturday night.  The bartenders were really rude and didnt serve us right away. And they said they couldnt transfer the bill to our table which I thought wasnt ok.  Our waitress was clueless when I asked her questions about certain meals she couldnt answer them and she didnt seem to know the menu. Maybe she was just very unexperienced.  My dinner was good not great. I wish my steak would have been a little bit more tender. The salad was ok but a little dry. And like I said the dessert was very good. We ordered cheesecake of course (I think we had the one with lime in it) and tiramisu.  Another thing is if you are looking for a more quiet/ romantic place this is not the place to go to. It gets very crowded and very loud in there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=180

You may be wondering why I didn't go to Cheesecake in Lincolnshire despite moving so close to the area. My answer: Crazy Waiting times.  Anyway, absolutely amazing ambience and delicious make for a great trip to Cheesecake. My family and I are not big dessert fans so we tend to focus all our attention on the amazing salads and appetizers.  Must try every single salad here along with lettuce wraps, and flat breads.

Jim J.,"Park Ridge, IL",2101,247,730,2.0,1/8/2018,"I have been to a few Cheesecake Factory locations over the years and have always had a good experience.  They are known for giant portions of tasty comfort food.  People flock to this place on weekends and we ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table.  The lobby is pretty cramped and the bar was full, so we just stood by the door. When seated our waitress was frazzled and got to us after a few minutes of bouncing around.  Maybe they were understaffed, but it was 5:30pm on a Saturday. She quickly took our drink order and got them back in 5 min.  She took our orders and our food came out in literally 10 minutes!  Our appetizer never showed up and she made up some excuse about the kitchen messing up.  Our food was cold (how does that happen if it came out so quick) and wasn't very appetizing.  My club sandwich (see pic) was worse than airport food.  It was bland with hard toast, wilted lettuce, minimal meat and a truly sad appearance. The fruit on my son's kids meal sums up the whole meal - no effort.  My small side of fries had no real taste and were room temperature.  I was tempted to complain but didn't want to worsen the waitresses seemingly bad night.

It wasn't that busy when we first ordered, but the restaurant slowly started filling in with the lunch rush. Unfortunately, we didn't get our food until 12:40, so I had no time to eat it. I immediately asked for the checks and some boxes to pack up the food, and I told the server that we were in a rush. It took him around another 15 minutes to bring the checks and boxes, and we didn't leave the restaurant until around 1pm.

Cara M.,"Chicago, IL",53,57,83,4.0,5/12/2017,"I LOVE cheesecake factory. From the bread to the service,I always have a great experience. Although the food was not amazing this time around, it will not stop me from ordering more new items on the menu. We got a new appetizer of hot Nashville chicken nuggets. Our waitress didn't think they were spicy, but she obviously has no problem with hot flavored foods, because it was too spicy for me haha. They also were mostly breading and a super thin layer of chicken. It was weird. If you like chicken nuggets, I suggest not ordering these as there is almost no chicken in it. I got the cauliflower steak. It was good. I don't know if I'll get it again, but it's a great vegetarian option. The couscous on the side was my favorite part. My fiance got the almond crusted salmon salad. He like the salad and the dressing, but was not crazy about the salmon. I don't like fish, so I didn't try it and can't say, but I'm passing the message on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire

Their menu is like a chapter book. I had the huevos rancheros and a chocolate chip pancake. My friend had a make your own omelet. The food was delicious. Totally hit the spot. Brought out fresh and hot. Everything as ordered. We even ordered a couple pieces of cheesecake to take home to our husband's since they were missing out.

It's always so hard to decide on what to get because there are way too many options to choose from (from pasta to burgers to salmon). I like how they include calories for each item on the menu, but it's a little alarming how many calories there are (most entrees are over 1000 calories).  We ordered the tomato basil pasta, lunch portioned spicy chicken chipotle pasta and lunch portioned miso salmon. Even though it took awhile for the food to come out, it was delicious! I'd recommend going with the lunch portions since they're smaller and cheaper.  And of course you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory without getting dessert! I mentioned to our server that it was my sister's birthday and ordered the strawberry shortcake to share. Several servers brought out the dessert with a candle on top and sang to her, which was so sweet. The strawberry shortcake was HUGE and sooo good - three shortcakes with vanilla ice cream sandwiched in the middle of each shortcake, topped with whipped cream and fresh strawberries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire

But fine, I went. It wasn't bad. It was actually good. The portions are still outrageously large, especially for lunch. It leaves me wondering how much food they waste. I'm saying this because my mom and I shared the spicy cashew chicken and even we had a few bites remaining. The spice could've been more pronounced, but overall it was a good dish. It's more like ""spicy-ish chicken with a few cashews,"" but hey, this isn't an Asian restaurant -- so I'm not expecting something authentic.

Gabriella P.,"Arlington Heights, IL",110,1,,1.0,10/28/2017,"ZERO OUT OF FIVE: THAT WOULD BE A GENEROUS OPINION.  I actually love this restaurant and was looking forward to a fun night with friends starting at The Cheesecake Factory- but once I left, my once fondness for this restaurant was completely erased.  I specifically chose this location because I figured the Woodfield location would be too crowded on a Friday night (even though it is closer to me), but nonetheless I was optimistic for a good experience and good food.  The food was good, as usual, but I can honestly say this is the WORST restaurant experience I have ever had.  Our waiter was not personable at all, and not in that he was rude or pushy, but more in that he was just completely absent overall. In about a 2 hour and 30 minute span- I probably saw him all of three times- two of those times where I actually had to find someone to grab him or find him myself.  I kindly asked a waitress if she could let him know we needed him at our table, and her response was ""Sorry he is really busy with another party right now."" This was about an hour and a half into the experience- and the table he was ""helping"" had arrived about 30 minutes after us. I didn't realize that a part of waiting on customers was assigning different parties different values. Let's also keep in mind that at this point the time was near 9:30 p.m., and many customers had already left. Even after all of this, we still ordered dessert, and it was at no surprise that it was another 20 minute ordeal just to receive our dessert. Please note also that I SAW our dessert sitting on the counter for about 10 minutes and watched my waiter chat with other staff members, and received my brownie with ""hot fudge"" cold.  At the same time, I understand that restaurants are busy, people get caught up. Once we finished our dessert- no surprise that our waiter went missing again. When I finally caught him standing at the computer, I asked for boxes and separate checks- another 10 minutes.  I always tip above 20%, because as someone who understands how hard it can be to be in a job setting where your performance determines your pay, I believe tipping is important and necessary. But this time, I could not bring myself to give a good tip. The service was awful and we ended up having to miss plans we had after dinner because it took so long to be helped.  Between me and two other friends and about $100 spent, we left a tip that anyone in that profession would find extremely insulting, but at the same degree well-deserved. To call this the worst experience of my life in a restaurant would be a major understatement!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire
Regina J.,"Lindenhurst, IL",10,116,12,2.0,7/21/2017,"I've eaten here several times and I have to say that this is the first time I can honestly say I was disappointed.  I ordered the lettuce wraps, but the first lettuce leaf had a hair on it.  Not sure how other people feel about this, but it turns my stomach.  I tried to make the best of this, and moved the offensive lettuce leaf off to the side, but I just couldn't get past it.  The manager walked by and I showed him the hair and he asked if I wanted some more lettuce.   I said sure, but I should have asked for a different meal (though he did not offer that as an option). He did apologize and bring me more lettuce, but I just couldn't get excited about my meal after that.  He never stopped by again to see how things were and I don't think he told my server that we had a problem since she acted like there were never any issues. I would also like to add that this was at 11:30am, there were hardly any people in the restaurant. My second criticism involves my server.  She was sweet and friendly, but OMG, she must have poured a bottle of cologne over her head before coming to work.  Every time she came by the table I had to stifle a cough.  Once she left, I had to wave the air to try and get the lingering smell away.  A restaurant is just not the place to wear heavy colognes, it really messes up the experience when it overrides the smell of your food.   I hope that this place can get their stuff together.  So disappointed....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire

Sonia L.,"Schaumburg, IL",290,161,153,4.0,4/12/2017,"So my workmates and I go here all the time and I will say this is one of the more beautiful Cheesecake factories. This time it was my birthday and I just graciously went along with my birthday treat.  I do my best not to frequent chains and if I do I don't usually review then because they are the same across the board. Service is what trips up or boosts a chain. Now that you know my opinion... more than you wanted to know.....I will most likely keep going back to this one. It is again really beautiful, high ceilings, fake but clean and attractive decor, roomy dining even waterside outdoor dining. It is a positive and pleasant place. Service is trained well and typically nice...I have yet to have a bad experience with the waitstaff. Now the food. This last time we went has prompted me to write a review. It sounds silly but I had a craving for a burger but that would have put me fast asleep at my desk so I opted for the turkey burger off the skinnylicious menu. It was juicy delicious! the brioche bun was actually a highlight instead of annoying as the bun often is when its too big on any burger. It was light and tasty and enough to hold down a very thick and yummy turkey burger. toppings are as you like and I always order mayo on the side. I forgot what kind of aoli this was but I did have a taste and it was actually not that bland mayo type of aoli..it actually had some flavor! I think the best part of the burger which I never even think about is the nest of caramelized onion. I think I'll always do it like this at home. Who would think a Cheesecake factory would have such a burger delight!. Came with a side salad which wasn't bad either. I washed it down with a half sweet half un-sweet tea. Then came the embarrassing song and free sundae. ---I would recommend that since it is Cheesecake Factory---a tiny B-day Cheesecake may be more appropriate but it was a free ice cream sundae on my birthday nonetheless. So thanks. It's hard to recommend such places but this one is a happy place...and do have the turkey burger--it's pretty good. So, I can't bash this particular place AWWWW  how sweet. I tried though.

Faith H.,"Glenview, IL",226,142,108,5.0,1/23/2017,"Overall, I'm a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. It's a good place for people to go when it's a large group and everyone wants something different. Their menu is so broad and diverse; everyone will be able to find something they like. Their food is consistently good and the prices are decent. That being said, I'm writing this specific review for my experience this past Saturday. My boyfriend and I had our first date here and it was our one-year anniversary. So to be cheesy, we decided to celebrate our anniversary by doing the same exact thing we did on our first date. Dinner at Cheesecake in Lincolnshire and movie at Hawthorn Mall. On our first date, we were super rushed because we were seated right away (it was a weekday) at 5:45 but our movie was at 7:00 and the movie theater is 12-15 minutes away. We decided to plan a little better and decided to get to dinner by 5:15 and go to the movie theater by 7. I know Cheesecake Factory is packed on weekends but I assumed it wouldn't be bad at 5. I was wrong. So wrong. The entire place was packed and we were told that we'd be seated by 6:10. That means we had 35 minutes to get seated, order our food, eat, and get out of there. My boyfriend suggested changing movies or theater or even going to another restaurant but I was adamant that things go exactly as planned. We waited and were indeed seated at 6:10 on the dot. Our waitress, Charneice, came over immediately and asked us if we wanted any drinks. I told our situation and how we had to leave in literally 30 minutes. I expected her to be rude and annoyed but she was AMAZING. She got her ordering pad and said, ""Let's do it, we got this...what do you guys want to order."" We ordered our entrees, drinks, and cheesecake. We told her we wanted the cheesecake to go and she told us that she would also grab out check so that we can pay early and leave as soon as we're ready. We got our food around 6:35 so we told her we would take a few bites and then pack it so if she could please get us to-go containers. She brought over our to-go boxes and we pretty much packed everything after 2 bites and left. We were out the door by 6:43 and I am still amazed by what a fantastic waitress Charneice was. We would not have made our movie without her help. She really saved our anniversary, hahaha. Definitely will be back and will request Charneice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire

As we placed our order, we were informed one thing wasn't available (grilled artichoke) - no biggie. We made an alternative selection. Overall, we were pleased with our meal. So much so that when Sunday rolled around, I couldn't get the artichoke that I didn't have out of my head. There are two locations about 30 minutes from my house. I called the location in Lincolnshire (where we were the day prior) on the off chance they might have the dish. The front desk put me on hold and told me to talk to the manager. She picked up after about 5 minutes and when I asked if they had the grilled artichoke, she replied that they did. Her tone seemed to imply I was goofy for asking. So, I explained they were out of it the day before. She said she's sorry to hear that, but said they had it now. So we headed back there for my artichoke fix. When the waitress came for our order we were informed...you guessed it...they were out of the artichoke! She also confirmed they didn't have it at all that day. Annoyed, as that was specifically why we were there and because I specifically called to check first, we explained about our call before coming in and expressed our frustration, initially asking to speak with the manager. It was late - so we decided to stay. We also told the waitress not to worry about getting the manager as we figured any discussion with her would be futile. After all, she was the one who was responsible for the frustration. We ordered two small things. An small plate of Cuban Rolls and Lettuce Roll Tacos. We waited almost 50 minutes to be served while everyone around us who arrived much later were served way before us. Because we complained? I don't know. But it is unacceptable to assure someone you have a dish when they call to check. It is even more so when you don't bother to check after they explain they are asking because it was unavailable the day before. And that kind of service, or lack thereof, when the place isn't even busy is ridiculous - especially when everyone else around is getting great service. Terrible experience. As a side note, the Cuban Rolls had good flavor - but were way too greasy. That said - the food was the least of the issue. Customer service, anyone?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=60

I've ordered my meal with modifications for dietary restrictions...it came out wrong with ingredients in it that I couldn't eat and missing the things that I could.

Super slow service. My coworkers and I work very close to this location and we like to go here for lunch but the last few times the service has been terribly slow. When you have an hour for lunch it makes it a bit challenging. The food is great. They even have an extensive ""skinnylicious"" menu that has a variety of salads, sandwiches, chili, and pastas that are great! I really like the lemon shrimp with angel hair pasta as well as the white chicken chili both on the skinnylicious menu. The cheesecakes are always fabulous! Generally, I get the original cherry cheesecake which is so very good! Of course with the name the Cheesecake Factory you have to do the cheesecake right! Absolutely outstanding cheesecakes!  A bit pricey but worth every penny. If you have never been to this restaurant you definitely need to check it out at least once just don't go over your lunch hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=60
Carole B.,"Waukegan, IL",2,7,,2.0,1/1/2016,"Went to the one in Lincolnshire... the service and building was great.  This was our first time going to a Cheesecake Factory.  Ordered:  Fried Cheese and Calamari as appetizers... those were just OK.  Baguette and butter was yummy.  Shrimp Scampi and Meatloaf as dinners: we didn't like either dinner item. Too much seasoning, too many flavors, too much cream... shrimp scampi was coated with some odd seasoned batter, dry noodles, just not normal seasonings - meatloaf and potatoes were drowned dead in thick yucky brown mushroom sauce and the vegetables were so over seasoned... it was just too too much.  And I was excited to go because I just learned it wasn't just a cheesecake / dessert store, and my friends were raving how good it was.  Will not go again.  And what's with the full page ads in the dinner menu?  I thought it was funny that the waitress didn't ask if we wanted dessert... Cheesecake is what they're known for isn't it?

Rosemary T.,"Lake Forest, IL",1,47,,2.0,7/7/2017,"Going to the Cheesecake Factory has always been the guarantee of a great meal, whatever was ordered.  Not so for the Lincolnshire restaurant in this chain.  The last three meals I had there have not been up to the Cheesecake Factory's standard.  All have been salads, one a Cobb salad that my husband and I both had.  We agreed that of the Cobb's we have had out at other restaurants, this was substandard.  The chef skimped on ingredients.  Lettuce, chopped egg, and a few other ingredients could be found.  Next two visits with friends and I ordered my new favorite ( as first experienced at the Milwaukee area Cheesecake Factory in the Bay Shore shopping area).  I tried it on my last visit to Lincolnshire and found it to be very overly-saturated with salad dressing.  I thought that maybe it was just an off night for the kitchen, so I again ordered it today while out with friends to celebrate a birthday.  It was even worse! The salad was drenched in dressing and very soggy.  The three people with me had Caesar salad that were, in their words ,""boring"".  Lettuce and dressing....oh, there were 2-3 croutons in each salad.  Our bill was $80.00 and we left feeling unsatisfied. We even skipped the free birthday ice cream sundae, as we were anxious to leave.  I will save my appetite for other Cheesecake Factories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=60
Ramya V.,"Atlanta, GA",0,4,,1.0,11/13/2016,I usually don't write bad reviews. But am forced to write Because of the very bad treatment given to us. Three of us visited Lincolnshire Cheesecake Factory last Friday for desserts. We order two Cheesecake for there and 1 to go. The person who took order didn't mention anything like there is no seating option available only for desserts. After paying he told us to wait in the bar area where we will be served. We were initially skeptical and since it was info from the  employee we seated ourselves in the bar. The bar tender seemed not happy and when the cakes were served he called the waiter.. took him away and discussed something. Alas we were given only plates and no silverware to eat the cakes.. when we asked a person near the counter she lectured us saying u should ask form  the bar. Yet 5 minutes later we saw her in the bar. The bar tender turned toward us and said ' I know where u are coming from and u might not know.. but this is a full service restaurant and u cannot be having these here.' It was rude and sounded racist to me. He finally gave some napkins and fork.. we politely told him we are not aware and we simply followed what was told to us. After a while we felt uncomfortable in the situation and thought it is better to take home and eat in peace. So we grabbed some boxes from pastry counter and packed. As we were packing the bar tender appeared again and asked again 'do u have all the boxes that u need?'in a sarcastic tone. We felt the service was so rude and humiliated. Might be it is not common and does not happen. May be we were ignorant. But the situation could had been handled better. In the end we decided not to visit any Cheesecake Factory although how yummy the cheesecakes are. There are numerous other bakeries that treat people fair. And the name or brand does not take any value when you look down at people. And this is not the first time it happened.earlier few similar incidents happened and we thought it is some minor issues and can be ignored. It's probably because the waiter had a long day or something....but it seem to be not. It is the true nature of few people working there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=60

B E.,"Glenview, IL",0,21,,2.0,10/17/2016,"Meh.  The Old Orchard location has much better service.  We waited 15 minutes for a table, then stood there for 10 minutes while the host tried to figure out where to put us when our table was ready.  We were seated and they were out of two of the dishes we tried to order.  Food took over 45 minutes from time of ordering to time of service.  Our waiter was very nice and friendly, but everything else service wise was really lacking.  Definitely won't be coming back to this location. Response to Management Response: Appreciate your reply however after we were waiting 45 minutes there isn't much you could have done to fix that; Being proactive instead of reactive with these types of issues would likely be the better solution as based on reading other reviews this isn't an isolated experience.  When the manager was seen just wandering the restaurant instead of helping in the busy areas that's a sign the place is in trouble from the top down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=60

Karen K.,"Skokie, IL",144,187,1567,5.0,12/1/2012,"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants.  The service here is always good (along with all other cheesecake factory chains i've been to) and there are so many choices of food on the menu. Here are some things to order Every table is served warm scrumptious bread which you'll have to be careful not to get too full on these before you order your meals.   Appetizer: SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES!!!!! My mouth is drooling just thinking about these.  Pasta: Louisiana Chicken.  It's really greasy but the fried chicken they include in the pasta is very crispy and gets very addicting quickly Salad: Santa Fe.  The salad comes with your standard mexican-style items such as corn,black beans, crispy chips,etc.  However, it's light and not heavily drenched in dressing which I like.   Dessert: um... everything. literally. you can't go wrong with any choice here.. but I DO love their tiramisu cake (not the cheesecake.. although their tiramisu cheesecake is also amazing).  If you're ever coming on a weekend, make sure you make reservations or you'll be in the waiting area forever.  The prices here are pretty decent considering the portion sizes which are huge huge huge!

It's an institution all around the country but I guess this specific location is the one that I make my rounds in. I would start by saying the only reason they don't have five stars is because they don't take reservations, but that makes sense to me since the place gets so busy especially on  Friday and Saturday nights during dinner rush. I love everything here, from the awesome salads, to the mini corn dogs, to the sliders, to the best wheat bread on the planet (with butter of course) to their sangria (super yummy and really hits the spot) and the finale of all finale's their CHEESECAKE!!!! It is to die for and seriously, they may have more flavors than Baskin Robbins, my personal favorite flavor is the tuxedo, it's not overly rich, but has the right amount of chocolate and white chocolate, wow I'm salivating just thinking about it now.  This place does it all right, from consistent positive service, to stellar food and drinks, to the crave worthy cheesecakes, and I mean there isn't a flavor on the menu that I didn't like. Whether it's a mom and me date, night out w/ my hubby or a last minute dinner with a bunch of friends, we always leave super full (because of all that bread we fill up on) and happy.

William H.,"St. George, SC",0,10,,2.0,6/21/2016,"I've been to this particular one once before and it was ok, my wife & kids had never been to any cheesecake factory so I decided to treat them this tuesday night.  First we got there at around 6:30 and had roughly a 15 minute wait on a TUESDAY! so yes they are a busy branch.  We get seated but the hostess provided no kids menus for my 7 & 9 year olds so when our waiter came some 5 minutes later we asked for them.  I ordered the chicken pot stickers for an app with hopes that I could share with the family unfortunately it only came with 5 so 1 per person...at $12 pretty expensive for fried dumplings, they were good though. I ordered one of their flavored lemonades(strawberry) which was very sour, switched to a rasberry lemonade but it was no better. My daughter ordered the kids salmon with mashed potatoes & sauteed spinich, the salmon & potatoes were fine but the spinich was inedible it tasted like they dumped way too much black pepper in it. my youngest ordered the slider burgers & fries, no ketsup on the burger and none on the side for the fries  which I didn't notice at first and by the time the waiter returned nearly 10 minutes had passed at that point and my son had already finished one of the burgers as is, dry.  He wasn't too happy. Wifes salad was fine, other daughters garlic crusted chicken was fine, I had the fried fish tacos which are average at best, not a whole lot of flavor to be perfectly honest, I've had much better. Of course we had cheese cake which was very good.  Overall I understand they were slammed but from the time we arrived until the time we left it was close to 2 hours so everything was a bit slow and the food average at best.  For $120 bill for 3 adults & 2 kids I definitely expect more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=40

I had not been to a cheese in forever and the prices on the menu have grown since I was here last, averaging 12-20 range. I am happy to report that out of nine folks no one's meal looked like a dud, they all looked yummy.  I kept it healthy and opted for the falafel salad with salmon. The server was a little lost in translation and did not manage to screw up the bill split two ways too bad, but the turn around time for the correction was a little too much.  My bourbon smash was tasty, so much so that even non-bourbon drinkers liked it. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Depends on whether you like bourbon I guess. I like bourbon, and I drink it to taste it, so imo they could have been a little more heavy handed on the pour.  Drink prices here have not changed, prices are still not posted on the menu and you can count on 10 plus for just about any booze drink.

Kristen H.,"Gurnee, IL",68,107,25,2.0,6/20/2017,"This review will have two parts since our party sat in two sections and had two different, but similar experiences. I dined here the evening of 6/16. My daughter was attending a teen friend's birthday dinner and they had a table for 8. I sat at a table with parents and there was three of us. I'll start with the parent's table. The fruit beverages were made incorrectly the first time and had to be re-done. Once we ordered our appetizers and meals, I was happy to see the number of items with a lower calorie count I could choose from and chose a chopped salad with apples. We waited a little while and then our dinners came out...before we received our appetizers. Appetizers came out a little while after. At this point, we had already started eating our meals so they were pretty much untouched. (They did get comped) We checked in with the teenagers. They were still waiting for their food. Our waitress was actually pretty attentive and kept our refills coming and apologized for the dinner/appetizer debacle (which she did not bring out). We ordered dessert and checked on the teens again; they had just received their food. We complained to our waitress and she said she would get the manager for us. I did enjoy my salad and ordered the low carb cheesecake with strawberries and it was great. I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything. We heard the servers singing ""Happy Birthday"" and thought they were singing it to our party so looked around the corner, but they were singing to another table. At this point, we had been at the restaurant 2 hours and we were done, but the teens were still finishing their dinners and wanting to order dessert. We waited. The birthday girl's mother spoke to a manager. About 20 minutes later, we moved and sat at the table next to the teens. We were waiting for their waiter to bring back change/credit cards. We noticed him assisting another table and serving them items. I'm not very comfortable with a waiter taking my credit card and then doing multiple other tasks. Once a credit card is picked up from a table, it should be ran and brought back. There is far too much fraud going on these days for a waiter to walking around the restaurant with people's credit cards. While we were waiting, the teens told us they asked for refills on their beverages but NEVER received them, had ""Happy Birthday"" sang to the birthday girl in the most dry way EVER (we didn't even hear it take place) and the waiter NEVER checked on them to see if they needed anything, if their food was ok or anything. All of our children go to restaurants frequently, many of them far nicer than this. They know how to speak up, they know how to ask for refills and they know how to behave in public. The birthday girl chose Cheesecake Factory to celebrate her 16th birthday with her friends and brought the business of 11 people there to do so. She was treated as a second class citizen. Totally unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=40

Of course, like the title of the restaurant says it offers cheesecake.  Wow desserts are top notch here and they live up to their reputation for sure.  Excellent flavors and they get very creative with their cheesecakes.   They'll come out with seasonal flavors too like pumpkin pie cheesecake.

Ed T.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,14,1,1.0,7/16/2017,"Most Cheesecake Factory restaurants are awesome and so are their Grand Lux cafes. This is the second time I've had a bad experienced at this restaurant so I have to write a review so others are aware. This location in particular has a poor staff with a lot of bad attitudes. We went there today and asked to be seated. A guy came in behind us and rudely asked for a to go menu while I was speaking to the hostess. Instead of asking the gentleman to wait until she was finished taking down my reservation she decided helped him and told me it will be 20 minutes. She forgot to write down my name and after 30 minutes passed, I decided to ask if our table was ready. She said I walked away and she didn't take down my reservation. Well I was sitting with my family in front of her and she kept looking over at my wife the entire time. I wouldn't have been mad but the fact that she gave me an attitude like it was our fault pissed me off. She knew she didn't have a reservation for us and she could have walked over and asked knowing that I had went up to the desk previously but instead she just stared. She's the Asian hostess with he attitude and as I was walking out with my kids she points me out to the other bus boys and wanted to give me the finger.

Yes, let's be aloof and prejudge just because there happen to be Cheesecake Factories here, there, and everywhere. Look, you're entitled to have a preference against chain restaurants just as much as I'm entitled to have a preference against Regis Philbin. There are more important things in life than to worry about what other people like or don't like. Here's what I like: the black pepper shrimp. This was a really unique flavor and dish, one I can't say I expected, being somewhat unfamiliar with Cheesecake Factory and it's 80 page menu. There really is something for everyone here, unless, that is, you want a hamburger, which they don't offer. We had the sweet corn tamale cakes, which were also very good, offering a good balance of several flavors. For dessert, on the off chance you have any room, try the low carb cheesecake. It's made with splenda but I'll be amazed if you can tell the difference, and plus it has a crust made from crushed nuts, which offers a flavor I actually prefer over the typical graham cracker crust. If you carry a bias against chain restaurants, by all means continue.

But, lucky for us, they can customize any order since food is made in house. I had the greek salad (FABULOUS) which I customized and they did it perfectly. I also had the buffalo chicken rolls which were amazing! Food was at perfect temp, served quickly. Waitress was amazing. Know that when you go here, it is NOT cheap! I hate that people complain....do some reasearch before you go. Not an economical lunch, definitely a splurge for most of us. Split a piece of red velvet cheesecake and it was definitely big enough to do so with some to spare! So good! Would give 5 stars if seating had been more accomodating/comfortable.

Plus the food at Cheesecake has always been consistently decent whether it's here with friends in Lincolnshire or with friends in Columbus. However, I feel that their mood lighting's a little too dim for my liking. Maybe it's to cover up the lackadaisical job cleaning up the film of oil/grease on their plates. We all didn't want to eat a full entree so we opted for the small plates. The roasted pear and blue cheese pizzette stood out. The fresh spritz of lemon and crisp arugula added a refreshing element to the pizzette. My friend's warm crab and artichoke dip felt like I was dipping into a chunky crab cake. Mmmm! Our server was super nice and accommodating. The wait was pretty ridiculous. 25 minutes? For Cheesecake Factory?

Thirty minutes for a Monte Cristo for the only guests in the restaurant is excessive.

Kevin B.,"Streamwood, IL",10,43,,3.0,12/23/2006,"A few months ago, my sister insisted that we go to Cheesecake Factory.  I had time limits for the night and was hesitant about going.  I hadn't been there before either, but entered the restaurant with trepidation. The wait was probably the worst part of the experience for me.  Not just the wait, but everything associated with it.  Their front entrance didn't have any place for me to sit for the 30 or 45 minute wait.  After about 10 minutes, I was wishing for a chair and ended up on the curb outside when I wanted relief for the feet.  The front had menus for me to read while in line.  I opened the menu and as people had promised, there was plenty on the menu.  Much to my surprise, I discovered advertisements in the menu.  Every other page had ads for local businesses and real estate agents.  This did not impress me whatsoever.  We all see a lot of advertisements and product placement through our day and the last place I want to find them is in my menu.  I am paying to eat there, I don't want to see ads (same goes for movies but that's another rant).  In addition to the wait and advertisement ridden menu, the restaurant is annoyingly dark.  They try to ""set a mood"" but it's a large, noisy chain restaurant.  It felt tacky and fake. Once we got to the table, my experience improved.  The food was generally above average and pretty creative as things go.  The waiter was prompt, kind, and humorous.  The lighting didn't improve, but I no longer cared as I had ordered.  The portions were quite large and prices were reasonable, especially for the amount of food I received.  If the portions were smaller, I wouldn't have complained. Maybe I went into The Cheesecake Factory with a chip on my shoulder and had an average experience because of that.  However, I cannot say that The Cheesecake Factory was a great experience.  The advertisements in the menu gave me frustration which I just cannot shake.  Call me bitter.  I know I am in the minority of people who don't think The Cheesecake Factory isn't the cat's pajamas.  I'm not against going again but I wouldn't go on my own wish.   I give it a 3 because of the food and service.  I also took into consideration my bitterness going in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=220

They are currently featuring (for the year) a red velvet cheesecake which is sublime.  It contains a red velvet cake and cheesecake filling topped with a white chocolate frosting.  Six of us shared it, and it was just enough to give each person a sufficient sampling.   In summation, this place still pleases.

Second time the pork was the most un-tender thing I've ever eaten. I just took it off to try and enjoy the rest of the sandwich. The bread was straight up artisan french bread. For a Cuban?!! I mean, I know you don't have Cuban bread but I expect a smooth french as replacement. It was just completely disappointing. My wife did enjoy her sundried tomato chicken pasta. I tasted it and it was good. Their bread basket is always worth my money (it's free). But I guess it's not really free since everything is a good $2 too expensive. Our southwest egg rolls were really greasy. They tasted good, but just super greasy. And I get it, I normally laugh at people who are like, ""my fried food was too greasy."" but I've had enough southwest egg rolls to know they can be done without the shiny layer of fryer oil.

We were seated in the banquet seating, which was okay if you like that. I'm not such a huge fan. Let me just say upfront that the food was wonderful! Everything we ate was delicious, and so filling.We've never had a problem with the food. It was more so the service that really bummed us out. The waitresses name was Colleen and her service was awful. Having been seated in the banquet section, we viewed tables seated on both sides of us. We observed throughout the meal that they had ordered just as much food as us, or more. Yet, they finished and were out the door way before us. We were halfway through our drinks by the time that the waitress came back for our order of appetizers. A good 20-30 minutes after we had been seated and given bread. When we ordered our appetizers, we also put in the orders for meals. By the time our appetizers arrived, we hadn't even gotten halfway through them when our meals arrived. We had to have the appetizers boxed up to make room for our meals. We were disappointed by this.  We found it a little odd, that both our appetizers and our meals were delievered by people other than our waitress. Our waitress didn't come through the meal to check on anything or see how we were doing. I repeatedly had to ask for larger bag to hold all of the smaller bags were give for our appetizers etc. This became very annoying.

What happens is that you squeeze in, the greeter takes your name and asks you to wait for ""15-20 minutes"". In reality this turned into over 40 minutes of waiting and there is minimal standing room for people waiting.  Once seated, the food comes out fast....TOO FAST! Before you can finish your appetizer, the meal is already there. However, when it comes to clearing plates, filling water or returning your check.... it takes forever! The rushed and cramped atmosphere does not allow you to have a relaxed and enjoyable meal. The tables were basically stacked on top of each other. The lady kept to me kept bumping me and the waitstaff run into your chair.  The food was dripping in grease and is nothing special at all in terms of flavor, presentation or originality.

J D.,"Chicago, IL",0,29,,2.0,1/16/2013,"Okay, I am only writing a review because this is my second not so fabulous visit to this location and I am frankly a tad annoyed at the slapdash quality of the Cheesecake bunch.  My first visit issues: salmon filet was undercooked, no attempt to offer a beverage, dessert etc. in recompense for raw fish. On the same visit we entered the ladies room, finding paper towels strewn about the floor, no paper in the stalls and a leaky toilet. An elderly woman was complaining when I came out of my stall, so we hunted down some paper from another. I am not an elderly gal, but it was gross to me as well and seemed odd, even on a busy holiday. So, off I went to let the powers that be know. I told a manager(?) at the front desk (and I was nice, I promise) who then barked at me ""Yeah, we know! We'll clean it as soon as possible."". Wow, really? Now, I did notice that almost all the staff were very young and frankly didn't seem to be Olympians in the customer service realm. But this IS a restaurant, right? Second visit was today: Same childlike crew, waiter was really young, with the whole 80's über cheerful thing going on, no problem. We order and just asking for a sauce on the side seemed to flummox him. Again, not an issue. However, my table mate's appetizer came, and IMMEDIATELY following, came her meal. Huh. I looked at the manager(?), who was setting it down and the waiter hovering as well, and just said ""oh"", was then asked if all was okay and I said I had presumed the meal would have come later. The waiter replied, ""I thought you wanted it all at once."" Huh. We would want an appetizer and meal all at once because......????? Neither of us asked for that so the presumption was based on.....????? HIS eating preferences?  So, Cheesecake corporation, you may want to spend a dime or two on more experienced staff....on all fronts. You are the only suburban sit down game in town with as vast a menu, so I know you have the coinage to step it up. Oh, and this is personal preference, but could you get an actually HEALTHY menu, not just a low calorie one? We are of an enlightened age, so maybe some things without mayonnaise, high sodium, cheese and fried stuff would make us artery conscious folks happy. Or maybe someone could open a really great simple sit down deli in the suburbs. I beg of you. Please serve wine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=200
Justin G.,"San Diego, CA",74,635,,5.0,11/8/2007,"I agree with Laura O. and Andrew P.  The lights are a bit dim and the menu is large, and it is a good place to go when you have a group that likes different things.  I originally thought it was just a dessert place by the name, but damn was I wrong.   Portions are big and filling, and everyone in my group of 14 seemed to be pretty satisfied with their meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=200

Kay R.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,4,,3.0,7/30/2015,"Rather unfortunate to say that ive yet to be fully satisfied with cheesecake factory every time i go. Portions are big and make the price worth, but the taste neve satisfies. I get the impression that cheesecake values quantity over quality. Environment is great, servers are very friendly, and it is a great place to eat out a bit fancy, but personally, the food just does not hit the spot for me compared to the rest of the restaurant's specs which are excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=160
Lindsey W.,"Vernon Hills, IL",2,41,1,5.0,6/13/2012,"I really like this place.  I have been to a number of locations, but I like this one because it is never crowded enough to have to wait to be seated when I come here.  They have a very extensive menu, and I've never had anything bad from it.  The crusted chicken Romano with white sauce is my absolute favorite. This past visit, I had stuffed chicken tortillas, and they were awesome.  My favorites for cheesecake are adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple and red velvet, but they are probably all good.  If a lunch portion of what you want is available, order it.  The portion will still be huge and you will still have leftovers.  Service is always spot on, which is major for me.  Yes, it's a chain.  They have yummy food though, so get over it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=160
Sludge R.,"Wheeling, IL",7,106,233,4.0,3/16/2014,"Very good. My wife is the picky eater, and she found something to mildly be a little unhappy about. Our server, Chris R, was fantastic. A server can make or break an experience, of course. The tables are close together. This didn't bother me. The restaurant was loud, and the couple next to us never shut up, so it was no problem for me. But it DID inhibit my wife. The music could barely be heard, but I did hear Me and Mrs. Jones playing.

Jennifer R.,"Palatine, IL",15,3,,2.0,11/19/2014,"I frequently dine at The Cheesecake Factory in Lincolnshire for lunch; I usually dine with family there a couple times per month, and I dine with a friend there once per month.  The customer service we experience is usually very good, which is part of the reason I keep returning (of course, the food is great too).  When I dine with my friend, it is always on a Saturday, and we usually arrive at about 11:30.  We are greeted by a tall man at the front desk who recognizes us as regular customers and says, ""Hi folks, a booth for two?""  He knows we prefer a booth, and is always accommodating.  There have been a couple times when my friend and I arrived later, the restaurant was packed, and there were no booths available.  That is completely understandable.  However, the customer service we received during our visit on Saturday, November 15th left us dissatisfied. We arrived at 11:30, and I approached the young woman at the front desk; I indicated that we were a party of 2, and that we would prefer a booth.  She stated that there were no booths available and that we would be seated at a table instead.  I looked around the restaurant and saw plenty of unoccupied booths, so I was a bit confused.  Shortly after that, the host (a young man) grabbed 2 menus and started walking us to our table.  Before sitting down, I looked around again, and noticed several booths unoccupied.  I pointed to one, and asked the host if we could have a booth instead.  He stated that we could not.  I then asked why we couldn't when there were many unoccupied booths.  He replied that people being seated after us would get a booth.  I said, ""So, people being seated after us will get a booth even though we arrived here first and specifically requested a booth?""  He indicated that was correct, and as I sat down, I stated that did not make any sense and is poor customer service.  He said that unfortunately, that is how it works sometimes, told us to enjoy our lunch, and walked away.  My friend and I felt that he did not handle the situation in a professional manner, and we were dissatisfied.  Shortly after we were seated, my friend noticed that a party of 2 was seated at a nearby booth. I completely understand if a booth is unavailable due to a valid reason, such as the restaurant being packed and all the booths are occupied.  However, in this particular situation, my friend and I felt that we were being treated rudely.  We still plan on visiting the restaurant regularly, but we are hoping this was a one-off situation we won't have to experience again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=160
Joseph S.,"Chicago, IL",23,5,,1.0,8/10/2013,"Let me get this out of the way - the food here was fine, but the service and the time it took to get served were horrible.  We waited over an hour and 15 minutes to get our food.  We  had to hunt our waitress down not once but twice - and then we had to find her again to get her to take our credit card so that we could get out of there.  It is wonderful to be able to have a leisurely meal - but only when you want it to be that way.  We saw three tables that arrived long after us get their meals before - I'm not sure what was wrong or if they just didn't like us.  We weren't loud, we didn't berate anyone and we left a good tip (it was obviously not our waitress's fault).  Just bad service - and when we complained we weren't listened to.  I would not come back here - nor would I recommend this to a friend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=160

Linda K.,"Arlington Heights, IL",51,34,,4.0,4/16/2011,"I had been to the Cheesecake Factory in Woodfield mall, but this was my first visit to this location. Got there kind of late on a Friday and thought there wouldn't be a wait but i think that place is always busy! Waited about 15 minutes so it wasn't too bad. I like the decor of this location. The place was loud and bustling. Our server, Rob, was very attentive and efficient. The menu is very extensive,  which I like, with many interesting items to choose from. We started with the crispy crab bites and white bean hummus for an appetizer. Both were quite yummy! I had the Herb crusted Salmon for my entree which was outstanding. The portion was very generous, as was  the side of garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. Couldn't even eat half...good thing for ""to-go"" boxes! My dining companions had the Luau Salad and the Spicy Crispy Chicken Salad. These items were also very generous in size, and delicious. Unfortunately, I've never been able to enjoy any of their decadent looking desserts because their entrees are so large!  All in all, the service, food, and atmosphere was very good. Not usually a fan of chain restaurants but I'll go back again to try some other items....or maybe just for cheesecake or Linda's chocolate cake!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=160

I still eat there and am not repulsed by the food. The food quality is great and if it's not, you should say something about it. My favorite dishes are the Hibachi Steak, Crispy Spicy Beef, and Ahi Tuna Salad. And if you don't mind consuming 1800 calories in a sandwich, go for the Shrimp and Bacon Club.

Vince V.,"Roselle, IL",70,161,282,4.0,1/24/2011,"In the interest of full-disclosure, I have never been the greatest fan of the Cheesecake Factory restaurant concept: take everyone else's signature dishes, reverse engineer them and resell the stuff under one roof with twice the portion size. It feels like Costco for the foodie crowd. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed myself the last couple of times I was there. The shrimp and chicken jambalaya pasta (ask for extra sauce) was excellent comfort food and the Honker's ale on tap was fresh. I finished up with coffee and a lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.

Sarah W.,"Joliet, IL",8,10,2,3.0,2/10/2012,"Recently had a business lunch there recently. They don't have any tables that are not half booth half chairs. When you have a group it's not fun to scoot all the way across a booth to the corner. The server was not very friendly and every person who asked a question about the menu was answered with a ""No"" and not a single suggestion. My biggest complaint is that we didn't get our food at the same time. 1 person received his food, then a few minutes later (after helping another table) she brought 2 more plates, then a bit more waiting until the final 2 plates arrived. Not cool. The only redeeming quality was the food and the fact that my water was constantly refilled.

Carl F.,"Effingham, IL",65,382,424,4.0,7/18/2011,"As always the food is great here.  The presentation is nice and portions are large.  Then of course the desserts are to die for.   This place is always busy, so if you can plan ahead, make reservations if your eating during the normal meal times.  If you get there at around 7:30 pm, the wait time is relatively short.    As for the menu, you will find it has a wide range of items covering the basic burger to mexican, asian fusion, and Mediterranean.    This is also a great place to get an appetizer or two to share and then top it off with dessert.   The only caution is, if your looking for an intimate dinner, this is probably not your best spot because it is generally loud and many of the tables are really close together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-lincolnshire?start=160
Jacob J.,"Chicago, IL",705,2456,3000,4.0,4/29/2009,"Nice location, reminds me of the Grand Lux Cafe in Houston, Tx (which is Cheesecake Factory on steroids). Business lunches, you need to get in here at noon or at least an hour before if you'd like to have a good table. No phone reservations, they'll give you a window of time that is optimal for a table. Great food, prompt and eager service. Something worth mention; a jacket had fallen off a chair, a gal within the group was seated at. Without a word, a table attendant grabbed the jacket and placed it back on her chair like a parent assisting a child to sit down. I can think of times where I've seen a waiter note to a customer that their jacket had fallen instead of picking it up them-self.  I don't go to Cheesecake often, looked for something reasonably priced like a soup and salad combo. Found a personal pizza and salad combo for $10.50. It was a 6"" personal pie that wasn't like what you could expect at Pizza hut. This was gourmet like a California pizza kitchen pie, got the BBQ chicken pizza with a side Cesar.

Sam M.,"Warrenville, IL",32,139,185,4.0,6/21/2014,"Every month or so we meet up with a friend; this is our halfway point, how convenient. The food is ok. They had a peanut butter noodle something a while ago, but it is no more. Since then I've tried several dishes and not really overly happy about any of them. I now usually get the jambalaya with the chicken and shrimp on the side. Tonight hubs got the pasta carbonara with chicken. It was alright, needed salt. He liked it, especially because he added my chicken and shrimp hah My girlfriend got the white chicken chili, which is tasty. Now, the major reason we dine here: the dessert. The chocolate truffle tower is amazing!! I usually cut it into thirds and eat it a little as I go, otherwise it's 1600 calories, just for that. Thirds make it easier on the waistline. Tonight I got my usual mango lime cheesecake. Love it! I ask for half on my plate and half in a to go box. Hubs got the red velvet cheesecake, he thought it was excellent, he could've had another piece. Fatty. My girl got the carrot cake and put some to go to enjoy later.
