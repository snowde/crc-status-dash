Bruce L.,"Denver, CO",53,1,,1.0,9/19/2017,"Went there tonight to pick up a Togo order from doordash. Arrived a little early and let the Togo counter cashiers know that I am there to pick up an order, and they informed they would let me know when the order was ready. No problem at all. I sat down patiently as I watched 4 other customers eventually get helped and was the last person there waiting for my order. The original two cashiers were still there as well as a third cashier who showed up later who did not know of my situation.  After patiently waiting about 20 minutes past pick up time, about 30 minutes total wait, I finally go up to the counter myself to let them know that I am waiting for my order. The new cashier looks at me and with an clear attitude to start off with and says ""Well IIII didn't know anyone was here for doordash"" with very apparent attitude in his voice, so I say to him ""Well I informed the two previous cashiers that I was here, and they told me that they would let me know. But yes, I'm STILL waiting for my doordash order."" I would not have responded that way if there hadnt been that look of disdain on his face and voice to start off with. After my response he then proceeds to aggresively put his hands on the counter as if trying to intimidate me and leans towards me and told me not to give him attitude. Clearly he had a problem with me from the start before I had even decided to give him my initial lippy  response. Granted I look like a 20 something years old, when in reality I am 30 years old, so I feel this guy got on his macho guy attitude on because he thought some kid was trying to make him look foolish.  I'm sorry but I am not some child that he can reprimand or tell me how to react to his intimidation so I just said, ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" In response to his intimidation tactics. If you are going to put your hands in a defiant manner on the counter and treat me as if I'm a child, of course I will defend myself. He then proceeds to ask me ""You gonna cuss at me?! What are you going to do about it? He was clearly trying to get a reaction out of me and yes it worked. So I told the cashier ""I'm a grown man and can cuss if i choose and fuck you"" and walked out the store. I then proceeded to call the manager of the store to explain what happened, and she keeps on saying I'm sorry if something happened to make me have a bad day? Uh yea you're cashier is ptententious ass. But by then I was so frustrated and was seeing red from being mistreated that most of my conversation with her was nothing but curse words. Been delivering from DD for two years. NEVER had an encounter like this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton-2
Zack K.,"Littleton, CO",397,84,6,2.0,9/17/2017,"You get two stars because of Stacey the bartender and the guy backing her up, (Jason?).  They were literally the only decent part of this entire overpriced debacle.  I've been here twice now and the first time it was fine.  I ordered their Evelyn's pasta, and being vegan, asked them to simply leave the cheese off and not cook it in butter as per the website.  No problem, done and done.  Ok, back again for a second try, as my better half wants a burger.  I order the same thing and she orders her burger on a different bread.  Ok, 5 minutes later our fill in waiter (for the waiter on break apparently) comes back to tell us the bread is shaped differently from the burger.  The burger is round and the bread is square.  Uh.  No problem.  After about five minutes of trying to fit a round burger on a square bun, we are informed we can order the other burger on the bread she wants or just take this burger on the bread it's on.  Fine, just get away from me so we can crack up.  Note, it's now been ten minutes and I have no wine I ordered.  About five minutes after, the waiter returns to tell me their ""head chef"" (quite a stretch) said the pasta isn't vegan.  I know. - That's why I said don't cook it in butter or put cheese on it.  The website says the pasta is vegan, try to keep up.  Ok, still don't have any wine and it's taken us explaining orders twice now.  Now I have a new waiter.  The IQ in this restaurant on average is remarkably low apparently.  I reorder my wine.  This Chianti sucks.  Whatever. About twenty minutes after our orders show up.  First thing I notice is my meal is literally half the size it was last time and sitting in a puddle of olive oil.  Both meals have been under the heat lamp for quite some time obviously.  I don't even have the heart to complain at this point.  My girl's burger is way undercooked.  I'm a vegan and I can see it from here.  Her salad is spring mix and the side of dressing is legit bigger than the salad.  Shoot me.  It then took fifteen minutes to get a piece of cheesecake to go that I know is frozen.  Maybe if the meathead server would have spent less time trying to hit on my lady then it would have had decent service.  At this point I'm not sure I even care about anything more than just getting the hell out of this restaurant.  I don't think we will be back ever.  Screw that.  This place feels amateur as hell.   P.S. Now neither of us feel very good.  Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton-2

Alice Q.,"Denver, CO",2579,1627,6815,3.0,10/15/2017,"The biggest Cheesecake Factory, right behind the Southwest Plaza mall. It's next to the Big 8 (Sports shop?) and there is to go parking as Always.

But we waited 30 minutes to arrive cold. The chiquiles and the eggs on top were cold and the other dish presented was incorrect. When they brought the correct dish it was cold. The eggs had cheese shreds that weren't even melted and my ""crispy"" bacon showed up almost raw. We had appointments for the day and didn't have time to wait another 30 minutes for fresh hot food to arrive. Didn't even take a bite. Three $3 on table for 1 cup of coffee and were asked to ""wait"" another 5 minutes for the manager to have the audacity to walk over and try to tell us he ""had our bill"" for inedible food we didn't eat a bite of.

Raylan G.,"Denver, CO",0,7,2,1.0,1/8/2017,"SLOWEST Cheesecake Factory on Earth! This location doesn't compare with the rest of them. The food tastes great- but getting it is another story! Longest wait with approx. 22 EMPTY tables...and I mean, they've been sitting empty for over 35 min with approx 42 customers waiting to be sat. I've been here many times and it's always the same. The waiter or waitress always says ""I'll bring you fresh bread when it's ready, but there's none right now."" Every. Single. Time.  Wait staff is not attentive to their tables the way they are in other Cheesecake Factories.

Heidi P.,"Littleton, CO",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2018,"That was the worst birthday dinner that I ever had in my life. I always went the cheese factory at park meadow mall; but they opened a new one at southwest plaza. Therefore, I planned my birthday dinner over there; but it was so so so upset me. First, the food was made wrong. Second, service was awful. Third, after I talked to the manager and he had done nothing. Forth, after I talked to manager, everyone acted differently. The waitress had to leave because her ride was here and she didn't want to spend money for Uber. The bus boy tried to make us leave by clean everything on the table ( especially the water that I still drinking). The new waiter told me:"" just tell me what you want to pay!"" After I mentioned that today is my birthday. Do I get a cheese cake for free? I usually a easy personal and not complain. Because I have 2 friends work at cheese factory that they told me the host suppose ask if we have any special events going before they sit us; but the host didn't ask me anything.

They have a good selection to choose from for Breakfast and Brunch.  I ended up copying my Mom but wish I would have ordered the Eggs Benedict or an Omelette.  We ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon. She got the bagel with it and I ordered the english muffin with mine.  Eggs were cooked perfectly! For both of us. Bacon was good too.

Doyle O.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,7,,2.0,5/8/2016,"Interminable wait for good food. We tried to call for reservations because we had a group of 8 but this location wouldn't take them. Instead, we were told to get there early and there would be no problem. This was a birthday lunch for my wife. We arrived at 11:15 for the 11:30 opening. Our group was third in line, behind two couples. The doors were opened promptly at 11:30 and we walked to the receptionist station. We were told that they couldn't help us there, to go to the other station. The other station was 6 feet away behind the same counter.  We were told to go stand by the cheesecake display case and wait. Other groups were being seated, including 2 different groups of 7. One of us went to the counter and asked when we would be seated and were told that we would be seated as soon as possible.  Finally, at 11:45 we were taken to a corner booth. We ordered and then began the wait. Bread came...another batch of bread came...our drinks were refilled. No food. I was getting ready to go ask about our meals when a meal was delivered. Great, I thought, here comes our food. This was at 12:30. We had been there for an hour and one of us had a meal. No other meal showed up. After five minutes (12:35) my meal came. So 2 of us had meals, but politely waited for the others. At 12:40 two salads came out. Then the rest of the meals showed up. So we started eating about 12:45...an hour after we were seated and one and a quarter hours after we walked into an empty restaurant. We finished eating and were presented with the bill. We were never asked if we wanted dessert, just given the bill and we left the restaurant at 1:30.

Adam V.,"Lakewood, CO",2,44,7,2.0,8/21/2016,"My previous review -- it was a little uninformed, I'll admit. Not only have I been educated on how several main dishes (besides the cheesecake) are here, I'm underwhelmed for sure. I have a friend who works at this restaurant. With that come a myriad of free dishes she receives. She happens to love it, which is odd because we have very close palettes. We love the same foods/flavor combinations. However, the main dishes here are just SO bland.  Thinking back, I've also always been really let down by the food here. It's fine, but nothing special. Especially when you're dropping over $150 on a special occasion. That much money makes you want to keep your head down and just eat it to justify the marginal main courses.  Having to put salt on food in such an ""upscale place"" is weird and embarrassing. At both locations, I've been very unimpressed. They pastas need way more garlic, the sauce is so vague tasting. The chicken is usually dry and flavorless, and everything else is almost a tease of the potential. Most of the cheesecake is good. Stick to the light fluffy ones. The dark chocolate rich type is a stroke waiting to happen.  My only theory is that this is an American themed place, so the average American person will complain if it has too much flavor.

Carrie D.,"Littleton, CO",156,336,10,1.0,2/7/2016,"I don't usually give bad reviews, but I have to say something this time. We came to this Cheesecake Factory in hopes of a nice meal. The wait was over an hour, so we decided to order food to go. They said it'd be about 25 minutes, which was fine. The girl who took our order was friendly and courteous. Great! So we waited. After about 35 minutes, I went to check on the food. Apparently the people taking orders don't speak to one another because the lady at the register didn't have any record of our order because 'the other girl must have helped you'. Seriously? So they found the girl who took our order and after looking for a few minutes, she found our food stuffed on a shelf behind the register. Again, Seriously?! So we took our food, home and big surprise, it was cold. Not like room temp cold, almost like it had been refrigerated cold... We were hungry so I nuked my and my husband's entrees. We ate the food. Mine was still not warm after 2 minutes in the microwave, so I gave up. The only thing good about our order was the cheesecake. To put the cherry on top of a bad experience, I got a nice dose of food poisoning from my dinner, so for 12 hours, I was in agony, with vomiting, dry heaves and terrible, sharp stomach cramps? Once I recovered, I did call to let the manager know and he told me that the dish I had, the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, was a very popular dish and he hadn't had any other reports of food poisoning. It kinda felt like he was telling me it wasn't their fault. But after not eating all day, having that reheated/cold meal and then 4 hours later being stuck with my head in the toilet, it kinda seems like that food probably was the culprit.

Not even a manager asked how things were. As I was walking out I couldn't help over hearing another customer complaining about the service. It's really nice having a Cheese Cake Factory near by.

We, too, were excited about the Cheesecake Factory coming to our area. What a huge disappointment. We've given them sooooo many chances to change our minds, and they keep failing, failing, failing - on all levels. The food is sub-par, over seasoned (even the kids' plates), and greasy. You have to beg for bread and butter when you order to go and still don't get it. Their attitudes reek of apathy. When we have ordered to go online, we have called to ensure they have gotten our order correctly. Even with this over-kill and their arrogant assurance that they will get it right - they have gotten it all wrong, time and time again. We finally contacted a manager, who promised to send a $20 gift card for recompense (even though we spent over $50 for another messed-up family meal). Weeks later we got the gift card......  Guess what? Went to use the gift card today (why did I do this - meal was horrible!!), and it was for $10. Even the manager can't get it right! An organization is reflective of its leaders .... it is apparent that a completely NEW management team needs to come in and clean house from the bottom up.

My silverware consisted of a rusted spoon and water marked fork and knife speckled with food. A table next to us had a wobbly table leg bieng propped up by a MENU.

No smiles and and appeared to spend more time caking their face with 1/4"" of makeup than polishing silverware. The manager was polite, but very curt as well and when I tried to find him about the silverware my waitor tried to yank it out of my hand and told me I had been ""doing nothing but complaining all night"". REALLY?! My mom had to ask twice for a glass of wine and my dad had to get up and go to the bar to get water. The food. My dad's tuna was tough and served with tomatoes that did not have the brown stem part cored out. I worked at einstiens for 10/hour and would not dare serve a tomato like this.

Candace M.,"Spokane, WA",277,671,1140,3.0,12/25/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. The food is good, the portions are huge, the menu is large, and the lines are long. In these ways, this location is pretty standard. I'm boring and when I go to the Cheesecake Factory, I almost always get the same thing: a grilled artichoke and a beet salad. The grilled artichoke was delectable, as always. The beet salad didn't have a ton of beets in it, but wasn't bad. Our waiter was very nice and friendly.  I will say that this location is a lot smaller than I expected. The bar is relatively small, so it's not somewhere you can rely on if they're busy and want a relatively quick meal. We were seated in a booth and were practically on top of a family of 4 next to us. We got to hear all of their conversation. Not ideal, especially for somewhere with atmosphere goals like the Cheesecake Factory. I got a mojito and it was very good, but $12.50. We took cheesecake home and it was also quite good. My only complaints have to do with the service. This is clearly still a new location, and there are some kinks to work out. When we got up to the host stand, what appeared to be a group of teenage girls stood around talking to one another, ignoring us until they were at a good place in their conversation. Really? Your one job is to greet and seat. Maybe focus on doing that. Also, we were ready to go and were just waiting on our cheesecake, which took way longer than any other part of our meal had. I would imagine this would be pretty easy so I'm not sure what the delay was. Otherwise, not a bad visit. It's pricey, so we may not be back with much frequency, but it's nice to have it in the area.

EM G.,"Littleton, CO",2,113,1,3.0,8/23/2016,"We were there at 3 pm on a Tuesday, nearly the only people in the whole place.  Our party of 3 was seated in a corner booth which was kind of fun, more than enough room.  We were approached by a waitress who said she'd be sharing wait responsibilities with Ashley.  Our drink orders were taken quickly and delivered quickly.  Our order was then taken and the wait started.  Thankfully they brought bread because we were starving and the entrees took their usual CF sweet time to arrive. Gigantic entrees.  Husband ordered the BBQ Ranch salad, lunch size (still enough to feed the Duggar family).  I got the Chicken Bellagio.  Our son got the grilled cheese kid meal with fruit. When the food did arrive, they brought out my son's and my husband's, but not mine (weird) and didn't say anything to me about ""we'll be right back with yours.""  They just disappeared which was, again, weird.  It felt like a very long time before they came back with mine though it may've only been 2 or 3 minutes.  Still, weird.  The food was fantastic pretty much right across the board.  There was some gristle in my chicken and I wasn't 100% sure it was cooked all the way through but I'm still alive 5 hours later so it must have been ok.  The pesto sauce on the pasta, though, was soooooooo delicious.  It's almost impossible to find good pesto on the menu anymore anywhere. My husband couldn't finish his lunch-sized salad but loved it.  He brought home the little bit he had left. I'm dinging them pretty hard for being inattentive.  I had to flag down the waitress for a water refill and she never once came by to check drink fullness on her own.  My husband's soda was never refilled in spite of the three bucks they charged for it.  It seems like a lot of other people have made the same kinds of concerns known here on yelp, and so it is pretty inexcusable at this point that it's still happening.  Particularly when the restaurant is so sparsely populated. It's very expensive here, too, though the portions are so gargantuan you'll definitely be able to get a few meals out of it.

The food is surprisingly good considering they offer everything from pizza to Mexican food and steaks & seafood which is why I gave more than one star. Always leery of these 8 page menus as there has to be some dishes that just don't sell as fast and likely aren't as fresh as the should be. I don't think they have a dish that could really knock your socks off, but they do well with what they have. Its not cheap; 13-$15 for a burger/sandwich is a bit nuts. Its the service that always irks me... As if they try to pass off poor, slow service as if it were really some sort of leisurely meal. To be sure a ""leisurely meal"" would include the drinks being refilled, attentive service with the waiter coming back to check to be sure your food was ""OK"" before you have had an hour so to consider it... Even worse when the waiter stops by in a half ass attempt to deliver service. Grabs one of 5 empty drink glasses and rushes off before anyone can ask for anything else. Then to take the cake he gets annoyed when he sets the refilled drink down and is immediately asked to refill the others before he can run off. Seriously this guy was either afraid of dining tables, allergic to table linens or he was running some sort of relay and was only required to touch the table and not do anything with it. Our waiter clearly did not want to be there. That or he was absolutely clueless when it comes to the 101 of waiting tables.  It got worse... dessert is at least part of the reason why many people go to the CHEESECAKE factory. Seems like if I worked at a CHEESECAKE factory offering people dessert would be a basic required function of my job. This was not part of the waiters plan though, he was ready to have us wrapped up, paid and out the door. Getting to order dessert was like pulling teeth. I know it was Mothers Day, I'm sure he had a long day and was tired of people and their Mothers making him work. These are not my problems, I am paying for it. Tipped $10 on $150 bill, which is about as close as I get to stiffing a server. I'm sure he expected more, and I had no problem looking him in the eye after I saw him pick it up and check the receipt. I have almost been fired a few times when I was waiting tables for questioning customers who left a crappy tip on what I know was good service. I am always prepared for the question when I leave a less than generous tip. Was kind of hoping he would ask me if there was a problem so I could explain the virtues of good service.

My husband, four kids and I went on a long hike and our treat was to go to Cheesecake Factory (having lots of kids, going to such a place is a rare occurrence for lots of reasons) and sit on the patio. It was a BEAUTIFUL night. It was so sad to hear, ""I'm sorry. You can't sit outside unless you want to separate."" I have to admit, I get REALLY tired of being penalized for having a lot of kids. When did that start? Is this a new thing in our country? You have to squeeze your entire family into a booth because people don't want to push any tables together? And is that not a fire hazard INSIDE? My husband and I went out to take a look and we found this: Two tables in rows, each sitting four. In-between the two tables were fake shrubs that took up the ENTIRE space between the two tables. I wish I could add a photo because we took one. It was unbelievable. Why are rather large shrubs that are stuffed in that space (with zero wiggle room) NOT a fire hazard? If there is a fire, will fake shrubs not be in the way? Will the firefighter OUTSIDE be OK with that? Or will they have to actually move them? Is it better or worse to have shrubs between two tables than having them pushed together? Will the screaming people leaving the building due to a fire trip over the shrubs? I don't understand. But, I know that our family won't be going back to that Cheesecake Factory . . . . ever. Because only small parties are welcome to sit on the patio. Period.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton-2?start=60
Andi A.,"Denver, CO",0,23,4,1.0,10/14/2016,"Just no! Very mediocre food at a high price. What happened here? This place was packed when they first opened and the food and service was good. Now? Nobody there, the bread isn't offered unless one asks and then it's ""in the oven"". What showed up wasn't even warm much less ""fresh out of the oven"". It's a chain, ok, but the prices are about $10++ more per plate than a chain. We ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer, was decent but for $11.50 there should be more than 3 scrawny halves and some over garlicky mayo. Also ordered spicy cashew chicken, about half of the serving they offered when first opened and about a quarter of the cashews. Tasted ok but for $16.95, um no! Other order was for the sliders, 4 squishy buns with some onions and a dab of ketchup, tasted like a dirty grill. Sent those away and while the were removed from the bill by the manager on duty, he never stopped over to see what the problem might be even though we were sitting at the table by the waitress station he had to ""adjust"" the bill at.  I will assume he already knows? Got a slice of cheesecake to go and while it is probably the highlight of the meal, at $7.95 per slice it's good but slices were almost twice the size when they first opened.

S.w. S.,"Denver, CO",10,4,,4.0,8/30/2016,"We visited The Cheesecake Factory in Park Meadows, CO, today for our anniversary lunch.   We arrived and expected a short wait to be seated.  We were given a buzzer to let us know when our table would be ready.  The guy behind the desk (host) wouldn't look us in the eye, as though he was WAY to busy to be bothered.  Not many people waiting to put their name on the list to be seated.  We waited outside thinking the buzzer would go off but after 15 minutes we headed inside to see what the hold up was, where we stood near the host desk another five minutes.  Then we stood next to the host desk to speak to someone to see when we would be seated.  The lady, who was taking the patrons to their tables, was nice and when she returned to the desk, asked how she could help us.  She asked the host if he had Shawn, party of 2, when he returned to the desk, seconds after she asked how she could help us.  He responded, to us, ""I called out for you about 5 minutes ago.""  AGAIN not acknowledging that we were standing right in front of him.  Our point is, we were provided a buzzer so why would we expect our name to be called, let alone, why wouldn't the host check out front of the doors by the patio, especially on a nice day like today when guests would choose to wait in the fresh open air.  He didn't even look at the lady hostess.    The Waitress was very nice and let us know what her favorites were out of the menu options which we were considering.  We talked to the manager and he was also very nice and attentive.  The manager made sure our food was expedited since we'd been waiting so long and offered us complimentary slice of cheesecake.  If it hadn't been for the excellent service from our waitress and the manager it would have been a bad experience.   We will go back, but probably to one of the other locations in our area.  Hopefully they have the host get some training on appropriate customer service.  Because all he had to do was say, I'm sorry you've been waiting so long, I can get you seated immediately.  Very rude.    The rest of the staff were top notch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-littleton-2?start=60

We received bread with no plates or silverware, then were delivered plates... but still no silverware... Eventually I just walked around and found clean silverware on another table. Our server hardly ever dropped by our table, food came out at way different times, parts of meals missing, and we never really got an explanation or apology, (or like, eye contact...) so we spoke to a manager- who seemed put out and like we were just looking for free food.

I have never....ever...been served calimari with cocktail sauce and tartar sauce. That's just wrong in soooooo many ways. Its a major rooky move and it wasn't good. Beau did bring me marinara sauce, but that was marginal also. There was no flavor to it. The other ding was the fact that they had only one soup to choose from. Not everyone likes mushroom soup.

Park Meadows (not specifically Cheesecake Factory, the mall itself) is a nightmare, we needed one on the west side of town...now if they would only build one up north...say...Westminster?? I'd be set! My friend and I go to CF for our little Christmas get together each year. I love their huge menu, you can get virtually anything you are craving. This year we split the Chicken Madeira, which was absolutely to die for! We also always get the Tex Mex Eggrolls as an appetizer...that dipping sauce is like crack cocaine...pretty sure I could drink a gallon of it on my own. Anyway, of course you can never fail with the cheesecake. My personal favorites are the key lime, and the original with cherry preserves. For being so new, I felt that the staff was very well trained. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and fast. As with every Cheesecake Factory location, the wait is usually long, we arrived around 5:45 on a Thursday, and luckily beat the rush. Others were waiting for up to an hour. They are picky about their reservations, so your best bet would be to plan for an extra early dinner, or don't arrive until after 8pm if you don't want a long wait.

Randy S.,"Littleton, CO",0,5,,1.0,2/20/2016,"I am a person who HATES to give bad reviews, But in this case I feel I have to. So far this place has been a total disappointment. We have gone twice. The first time was just before Christmas and they had not been open long. We got there at 5:30 and they said there was a wait of 2 hours. There is extremely little seating to wait. They are in a mall so you would think they would have a way to page you anywhere in the mall. Everyone has cell phone and a simple text should suffice. But they only have the standard blinking pager. This you can't get as far as the main mall hallway. So you have to stand for two hours or just guess. We guessed and made it back 30 minutes early only to be told it would be another hour and a half. That is a 3 hour total wait! My wife is diabetic and we timed to make sure she wouldn't have any issues. We ended up waiting 3 and a half hours and the food cane out cold. The apologies profusely and compped us desert (great idea for a diabetic). But I decided to give them a second chance. They were new and it was the holidays. Mid January we tried again. Once we decided not to wait again for a 2 hour wait (once bitten, twice). Next time we went back at 4:00 on Saturday we didn't have long of a wait. However, we had to wait 45 minutes between the time we ordered and for ANY food to arrive. Then everything came at once. Bread, salad, and main coarse. And my wife's Shepard Pie was again cold. Also, the had a very young woman with very long hair who was part of the seating staff hanging around the wait staff station, doing her best flirting not 10 feet from where we were eating.

Megan H.,"Littleton, CO",112,15,6,2.0,12/6/2015,"I have been to several Cheesecake Factory's over the years. While I'm typically not a big fan of chain restaurants, CCF is usually pretty good. We did have a large party of 8, so I figured it would be a long wait for a table. In addition, I also assumed there would be some hiccups in the service considering they had only been open a week. When we finally got seated after an hour and 15-minute wait, it took FOREVER for anyone to even come to our table. Like, probably almost 15 minutes...just to get our drink order! I ordered a glass of the Matua Sauvignon Blanc which was $2 cheaper per glass than the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc. I love Kim Crawford, but sorry - I'm not spending $10.50 a glass when I can get a bottle for $13 at Costco. I also asked her the difference between the regular chicken salad sandwich and the Skinnylicious chicken salad sandwich, as there was $1 difference in price and nothing looked different in the 2 descriptions. She said the only difference was that it came with salad instead of fries. I asked her to clarify because the regular one, you also have the option of getting salad instead of fries. She said that was it. Fast forward 55 minutes (yes 55 minutes because that's how long it took to get our food once we'd ordered), and here were the issues. I went with the Skinnylicious version of my sandwich because I always get salad with it anyway, and it was barely even HALF the size of their regular portion. I was basically starving at that point, so I wasn't super thrilled to get half the amount of food for only $1 less. Also there was maybe a tiny drizzle of dressing on the tiny salad. They brought the wrong thing completely for one person in our party, but she didn't want to wait any longer so she just ate it. The manager did come over and apologize for the food taking so long but it was all of 3 minutes before it actually did come out. I asked our server when she came back to the table if the sandwich was smaller than the regular portion (because hello, I'd specifically asked her what the difference was between the 2 and this wasn't mentioned), and she said, ""Yes it's smaller, but it is the Cheesecake Factory so all of our portions are big here."" ?!? Okayyyyyyy, thanks for the lecture, and you should have told me that to begin with because I would have spent the extra $1 and gotten the amount of food I was expecting. At the end of our 2+-hour dining experience, we receive the check. And she had charged me for the Kim Crawford wine rather than the Matua that I'd ordered. When she tried to argue with me, 3 people at my table confirmed they'd heard me order the Matua. Mind you, it was family I was with, so if I'd ordered the wrong thing and didn't realize it, they definitely would have told me. She huffed off to adjust the bill and was rude to everyone the last few minutes we were there.
