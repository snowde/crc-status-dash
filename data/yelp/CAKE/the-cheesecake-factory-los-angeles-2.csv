Rita W.,"Rockville, MD",527,337,1553,4.0,10/1/2012,"Did this location close already? I don't see it listed on their website, and no one answered the phone number listed. I saw that there was a recent review, so I went to check it out, and the sign is gone... SOOO SAD! I couldn't use my $25 cheesecake factory gift card... *sigh* Anyways, this place gave me good memories during my college days.  I tried nearly all the cheeescakes on menu, and I've definitely picked out some favorites. I am glad that they still have their red velvet cheesecake on menu, especially since I thought it was just a seasonal thing.  Their salads are good, but their chicken picatta was super gross.  I loved their cheesecakes. Byebye, this location... I guess I'll have to drive a few more hours in traffic for the next closest location by the west side: Beverly Center.  UGH!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2
Ken S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1014,278,551,4.0,2/9/2012,"I come here quite often because I live in the neighborhood.  This is one restaurant that I can always count on.   Their service is great, the restaurant has a big layout with beautiful outdoor seating with a water fountain in the middle.

Alan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",506,1367,207,3.0,7/2/2012,"A friend had chosen this Cheesecake Factory for lunch. This location is in dire need of a remodel. Anyhow, there is validated valet parking in the underground garage. The entrance is on San Vicente Boulevard, but the entrance is difficult to see. The parking entrance is west of the restaurant. Validation is for 1 1/2 hours and then I believe it is $2.20 every 15 minutes thereafter.  If you had to eat here, I would suggest eating outside as eating inside reminds of a place your grandma would dine at. Also, these circular booths with the mirrors behind you remind me of a strip club. Our server Brent was really nice and prompt. I feel bad for him because there was this rude customer that was sitting diagonally across from us. I even took a picture of this lady because this lady had the nerve to steal the house bread. She was barking orders to the waiter which was so rude. She was so loud, we could not help hearing her nor laughing at the situation. We even made a joke to our waiter about the lady and he got the joke.  My friend ordered a Santa Fe salad while I ordered the Chinese chicken salad. According to him, his salad was good and I thought my salad was good. After coming to this location, I think I would rather go to the other Cheesecake Factory locations around the Southern California area just because I don't want to feel like I am in a funeral home while eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2
Hannah M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",324,275,101,3.0,7/9/2010,"Cheesecake is cheesecake is cheesecake.. If you have been to one you have been to them all. This one is nice. I like the outdoor seating by the fountain. I have come so many times that I can say the service is average. There have been a few BIG issues but they handled them with comps. (As they should have in these instances!!) Today I called in a pick up order and a woman with the syrupiest voice answered the phone. I can't STAND that uuuuber customer service voice. I did not call a freakin sex line!!! I called a restaurant! For anyone who uses this voice in their job, just know the rest of us CAN'T STAND to hear you. Talk normal! It's insulting to hear the stupid voice. Anyway, I walked in and the guy who had the to-go orders asked me if my name was Hannah. I liked that and the syrup voice girl was no where to be seen so I am happy again. LOL! The menu is so strange. I don't like being marketed to while I am trying to find food. There are also too many options.  You really need to find something you like and keep getting it when you come because not all of the ga-gillion options taste good. Try the stuffed mushroom appetizer, or the avocado egg rolls. They are both good. I also like the dinner Caesar salad with chicken. Overall.. it's good but totally overpriced.  Also, they have validated parking underneath and street parking. (Just make sure you pull into the right lot! There are 2 and you won't be validated at one of them. The sign says ""Cheesecake parking,"" so pay attention or you will have to exit and circle the block to get back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2

Huge portions of overpriced food.  There is never a visit without an issue.  From food that is supposed to be hot being served cold to picking up a take out order and finding something is missing when you get home. The service has been inconsistent and now we only go once in a blue moon.   I left a pair of Persol's behind which the manager acknowleged...when I went to pick them up they were gone.  My iPhone was left behind and a bus boy tried to keep it...thank goodness I have Mobile Me and was able to tell the manager that even though no one turned my iPhone in, it was at her restaurant according to Google Maps...magically a  bus boy suddenly found it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2
Brandon C.,"Pleasanton, CA",57,474,16,1.0,9/5/2011,"Apparently no one is watching this location in the management chain. This is by far the worst CKF experience I've had. Nothing like the usual very buttoned up service, delivery and atmosphere the other locations deliver. The staff was clueless and running around in different directions, often attempting to deliver food to the wrong tables multiple times. Our server appeared to be the only one in the outdoor section and was constantly being flagged down by his tables for forgotten or incorrect items and apologizing for some mistake. The one star is for the tuna salad sandwich that tasted good but needed more tuna.  The bathrooms were also in disrepair and in need of some attention.  Management - you need to visit this place and straighten it up. I won't be coming back when the Beverly Hills location is much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2
Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",507,559,1042,5.0,3/27/2012,"I ADORE the Cheesecake Factory! I think it is my FAVORITE restaurant! I went to the Cheesecake Factory a few times now and the most recent dish I tried was ""Crispy Chicken Costoletta"" DANG! Sooooo Good! I usually don't order same dishes I have had before, only to try new ones but.. I have to tell ya, it was my 2nd time!  Side Note: I never tried asparagus until when I tried this CHICKEN! The first dish I ever ordered was Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, which was good but don't think it suits my tastebuds, and probably won't be ordering that one again! Now I don't remember which dish my friend got the first time I went but I think it was the Caramel Chicken! I have a picture but I don't know if it was that one. How could I forget! I LOVE the interior of the cheesecake factory, it is sooooo cute! I definitely like how the servers are dressed in all white too!

Kevin B.,"Signal Hill, CA",211,857,4993,3.0,3/4/2011,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in probably a year or so.    Went to this Brentwood location for a first date. The food is good, more then good in fact, but it's not exceptional.    The service was what you'd expect for this type of restaurant, polite and attentive, but not 5 star. I had the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad and my date had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.   I thought the salad was fine but nothing special.   It was topped with these thin sliced, lightly battered onion rings, which were, in a word, HORRIBLE!  Ugh, so bland and flavorless!   After eating one I pushed the rest aside!   Other then this, it's a VERY large salad!    I was full after just a third of it!  My dates Crispy Chicken Costoletta with smashed red potatoes and asparagus was VERY good!    I should have ordered that instead!    No dessert for us this time around!

Shannon H.,"Los Angeles, CA",332,312,161,3.0,2/7/2012,"My fiancé and I visits this location on a weekly basis. Never really had a problem with this location except for the fact that they always seem to mess up our orders on every visit. We usually enjoy.lunch or dinner here. The Renee special for lunch is great. A 1/2 turkey sandwich with salad and soup. I suggest spending lunch here on a Sunday to experience their broccoli and cheddar soup. For dinner, we usually order buffalo blasts, wings, the Renee dinner special and a Chocolate Gorilla shake. The wings are amazing! Crispy and spicy. Don't let being on the appetizer menu fool you lol, they serve a pretty decent amount of wings that's filling. The reason I give this location 3/5 stars is because the waiters are never anywhere to be found. During a sit down lunch or dinner you may see the waiter twice! We sat in a booth once with mirrors and could see our waiter behind us in the kitchen flirting with a female co worker. We had the busser fill up our drinks twice and provided us with more ranch for the wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2
Steven V.,"Sacramento, CA",534,623,621,4.0,4/11/2011,"I went here for the day before my birthday with a few friends, but I've to a couple Cheesecake Factories and enjoyed the dining experience.  I've had appetizers, Chicken Piccata, the salad, and sandwiches at Cheesecake before and they're all good. I like the big portions and quality food, and it's always nice to have a fancy lunch or dinner at Cheesecake when you get the chance.  Usually known for its elaborate interior and regal setting, this was the first time I sat outside by a fountain and enjoyed the nice sunset sky as I was dining at a cheesecake. I don't know if it was worth the sacrifice of the large and comfortable booths, but I'm a fan of trying new things.  I ordered a rib eye steak, and it was delicious. I also used my $1.50 Cheesecake coupon from facebook, which was the best deal ever. I had the Reese's Cheesecake which was extremely rich as expected and I couldn't finish it, and it wasn't my favorite cheesecake. I've tried Oreo and the Red Velvet, but the best was the chocolate crust with coconut, omg best combination of flavors ever.  I like other locations better, but if you're around the area and want to find a place where most people will be satisfied by the food, come to this Cheesecake that's hidden but at the same time close to all the hustle and bustle of Santa Monica.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2

Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",451,205,22,1.0,9/24/2010,"I used to love this place...really I did.  But this last time turned me off probably for good. Every year I break my Yom Kippur fast with friends at this location.  This year, I had received a $10 off gift card in the mail and I was excited to use it.  This year, I picked up the order and was informed that the gift card would not be honored at that location as it was only for the on in Beverly Hills.  Fine.  When I bit into my Santa Fe Salad at my friends' place, I bit into a BROKEN RUBBER BAND.  So that killed my appetite after fasting for 24 hours.  It was disgusting!!!   I called the restaurant to complain to a manager and after being on hold for almost 10 min, the manager didn't really express any remorse but instead started offering excuses for how or why a rubber band would be in a salad.  Sorry, but last I checked, there have been no health reports explaining the benefits of putting rubber bands into your diet so I didn't want to hear any excuses.  The manager offered me yet another gift card which I appreciated, but I received it in the mail yesterday and it barely covered the cost of my meal.   Very disappointed....bye bye Cheesecake Factory Brentwood.  I doubt I will ever be at your location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2

I usually make it into four meals actually :)) My favorite dishes here include: Spicy cashew chicken, Bang bang chicken and shrimp, and Sweet potato fries.

I really like this place, even though I never need to go again.

Their holiday special cheesecake, the Peppermint Bark cheesecake, is AMAZING. flourless chocolate crust, original cheesecake swirled with a reddish peppermint streak, whipped cream, and crushed candy canes on top! sooo good. omg. i'm so sad it's only for the holidays!  now onto food. pretty much the same as every other cheesecake factory location, but has always been high quality. i've never had a dish show up here that i found less than satisfactory. my favorites are the avocado eggrolls, pasta da vinci, kobe burger, spicy chicken chipotle pasta, and their AMAZING caesar salad. i always get a caesar, and it's always amazing. the dressing has a great bite, with garlic and fresh ground black pepper. it's not too much dressing, nor too little, and you can't actually taste the anchovy, thank god. the one time we ended up with a small, sad-looking salad portion, they replaced it with a new, large one when we complained. nice. it's a long wait for a table during peak hours, and open seating in the bar area is a god send. HOWEVER, service there can be pathetically slow, with 1-2 servers for the entire area and they are NOT really on top of their game. needs work, CF. all in all, if you want predictably good food and a decent atmosphere, come here. if it's warm outside, the fountain-side patio is a great setting. beware parking: valet only, 2.75 with validation after 6 pm, but before 6 pm it's free but only for 1.5 hrs, after which is insanely expensive (we messed up once and had to pay almost 10 bucks!). see if you can get there before they stop serving the peppermint park cheesecake; it is just sooo good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=80

The restaurant will validate your parking, so you usually end up paying $1.75.  Now onto the food.  I enjoy their bar area when I just want to catch up with friends.  All their drinks go down smoothly and I like my spinach and artichoke dip on the side.  The sweet corn tamale cakes are really good too.  They put salsa and sour cream on it.   In the words of Ms. Ray, YUM-O. I know the selection is wide, but If you want a dinner entree rec, my ultimate favorite is the parmesan crusted chicken romano.  Ask them to serve it with bowtie pasta and cream sauce instead of the light tomato sauce.   For a spicy kick, try the cajun jambalaya pasta.  I also like the chicken madeira, but that's too mainstream.  If you're feeling the winter pounds comin' on, then try their HUMONGOUS salads - the santa fe, bbq ranch chicken, grilled chicken tostada, herb-crusted salmon or seared tuna tataki salads.   The only thing I wouldn't recommend here is their fresh fish tacos ... somewhat bland.   Onto dessert!  You HAVE to try their coffee heath bar, oreo and kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecakes (hey, anything with alcohol in it sounds good to me!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=80

Tami R.,"New York, NY",204,289,2,4.0,10/28/2006,"It's the cheescake factory, so it's predictably good. My friends and I have a few opinions about this place.. 1) every restaurant should do something really well, but it tooks us a while to realize what they do well (other than the obviousl cheesecake)... they made pretty decent healthy chinese food. The veggies are always crisp and there's always enough to share and then eat for lunch the next day.  2) My friend Natalie from home has this theory about every cheesecake factory.... they give you an ungodly large staw, continiously refil your water in a large glass so that after you've eaten a tone you have to go to the bathroom... at which point you pass by the cheesecake and say mmm that looks good but I'm sooo full.... then you do your business and have to go back to your table, at which point you again pass the enticing cheesecake and say ""well we can order a piece and share it now that I have room"". But when you get back to the table you realize all of the cheesecakes sound amazing and you can't decide on one between all of you and you have ot order more than one slice. And that's how with oversized portions they can still get people to have room for dessert. On a side note, you can order the full menu from the bar so if the wait is forever try to get seats in the bar area, it's a first come first serve sort of deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=80

Upon entering, I was in awe at the sheer size and variety of Cheesecakes offered in the glass display.   If this place didn't represent all that was American, I don't know what does.  We opted to sit outside (at my apprehension after reading my fellow Yelpers' reviews that service outside was inferior to service inside) since it was a pleasant day.   I found that this wasn't the case at all:  the service was quite good.  Upon opening the telephone-sized book called the menu, I was impressed at the variety of options from which to choose.  We ordered: GRILLED SHRIMP & BACON CLUB (Shannon), CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD (Bernie), THE CLUB (Ben), and I had the CALIFORNIA OMELETTE.   Everyone seemed quite happy with their selection -- needless to say there was food left over.  I tried the shrimp/bacon club sandwich and I can say it was even better than my omelette.  The bread that was delivered to the table was delicious (especially the squaw/dark bread) and everything was true to the Cheesecake Factory name:  LARGE baby.   Incredibly enough, I was the only one gluttonous enough to leave no trail of food on my plate.   I only wish they had the little piggy nose to give clients if they finish all the food on their plates.   Nevertheless, after scarfing down the entire meal, I HAD to try the famous cheesecake (OINK OINK).   Bernie opted for the 30th ANNIVERSARY CHOCOLATE CAKE CHEESECAKE  and I opted for ADAM'S PEANUT BUTTER CUP FUDGE RIPPLE.  It was, by far, the heaviest piece of cheesecake I've ever stuffed into my piehole.    Really delicious, but, must be on the order of 800 calories.  Wow.  Needless to say, I didn't eat dinner that night.   All in all, my first experience at the CF was a pleasureable one.  We were stuffed and happy.   If only they had wheelchairs to wheel out the stuffed patrons to the cars....then I'd surely give a 5 star review....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=80

I don't care how big they get, or how many people in Nebraska brag that they now have their own location and don't have to go to fancy-pants West LA... I love this joint. Let me list the reasons. The huge menu. You literally can walk in their with no idea of what you want to eat, and you'll find something good. The Portions. Are huge... like really big. You'll always have leftovers and a doggie bag. The Prices. Are reasonable. You can always afford to eat here. The Cheesecake. You name it, they have it. I prefer the plain with fresh strawberries though. And you can buy whole cheesecakes for parties. Not cheap... The Brentwood location has a good-sized bar in the front, where you can eat off the entire menu, or just have a drink. The main room is large and comfortable, but not as large as the Marina or Sherman Oaks. And the patio is great - tables surround a fountain, which is nice during the day or at night. Parking is validated in the structure below, a dollar or so for an hour and half (I think).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=80

Douglas P.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,5,,4.0,9/7/2011,"It's hard to review chains but I give the Cheesecake Factory 4 stars. I am holding it to chain standards, not high-end restaurant standards, but as a good, solid chain, it deserves four. I think Brentwood is one of their best locations. I enjoy their Asian-inspired appetizers like the spicy Ahi tempura rolls and the Thai lettuce wraps, which are a great staple of this restaurant. Usually when I come here with a group for a business lunch (it is good for groups and people you just need to have a working lunch with and not necessarily impress), we'll order multiple appetizers and share across the table, like family-style tapas. Often the appetizers are enough.  I always get dessert here though, as its name suggests, I don't eat at the Cheesecake Factory without having a piece of cheesecake! My personal favorite is the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake with a coffee. We're not in Italy here but they make a decent cup. I recommend this restaurant particularly for lunch meals.

Server was amazingly attentive and friendly, and even though time got away from us, by midnight, he still served us happily. Perhaps because we were one of the last tables, the food came out fast and perfectly cooked. The fries were delish, much better than other locations with the crispy shell and soft center. Vietnamese tacos with pork belly and pickled veggies were surprisingly accurate with Asian flavors and very tasty. Chicken and biscuits was good if you like your food mushy. The chicken filets tasted as if they had been boiled, still flavorful but very soft and fork-tender... piled over mashed potatoes, and smothered with cream gravy, peas, and mushrooms. Biscuits weren't memorable but overall, good comfort food. My steakhouse cheese burger with pork belly and fried egg was juicy decadent goodness as well =) Frozen mango margarita, which has been my go-to drink for the past few weeks, did not disappoint. Very refreshing and smooth, though not that much alky. And my only gripe is for the cheesecake.

Monica C.,"Long Beach, CA",81,82,44,4.0,7/31/2010,"Out of all the chain restaurants there is, Cheesecake Factory is by far the best. This is no understatement! Value? Check.  Large portions? Check.  Good tasting food? Check.  Variety? Check. Check.  Dessert? It's called Cheesecake Factory for a reason!  Good alcohol selection? Fully stocked bar!  Service? Decent. Parking? Ehhh. Overall, this particular Brentwood location is set apart from all the other Cheesecakes because of their outdoor seating. I've been to quite a few and to be honest, I think the tables surrounded by a huge fountain makes the restaurant more upscale and less like a chain - totally fits into the Brentwood neighborhood as well.  Usually Cheesecake Factory does not do reservations, but I hear, if you know somebody that works there or want a particular server, you just might be able to get seated in a timely manner!  Yet, what I felt might draw people away from coming to this location might be the difficult parking. They have their own valet parking garage that you can get free parking for 1 & 1/2 hours if validated and parked before 6pm, but after that, it's a flat rate of $2.75. All I gotta say is, that's LA for ya and if you want to save a buck or two, eat fast and come before 6! They wouldn't even let me slide for parking at 6:02 :[ Also, what I didn't like about this location was their restroom. I know this is odd, but all the other Cheesecake restrooms have quite a few stalls (this had only 2) and look just as elaborate as the interior of the dining area (this bathroom was not cute).

Ok, so the parking fee sucks - they make you valet your car, but it should be no reason to deter you from going.  It's like the Redondo Beach location, but much much cozier and rustic.  I flippin love sitting in the Patio. The service here is excellent - as most Cheesecake Factories have great service, but I was quite impressed by how particularly friendly the hostess was and how kind my server was.  They demonstrated the perfect amount of attention and gave us enough privacy to make us feel as if we were in our own corner of the world. I don' think I need to mention the food.  You don't go to Cheesecake because of the food, but you go for the Cheesecake.  Their Red Velvet is AWESOME, but its also a heart attack waiting to happen.  I usually go for the Banana Cream, Turtle, Original with Strawberry, or their Oreo.  Can't ever go wrong with any of them.

One, the presentation of the calorie info on the foods MAKES ME UNABLE TO EAT ANYTHING ON THEIR MENU.  I guess I just prefer to not know that my favorite dish is gonna set me back 2000 calories.  I miss when i could eat in ignorance.   And lately the servers I have had have either had sections that were too big (so they couldn't manage their tables in a timely manner) or they were just inattentive.  Whenever I needed something, they weren't around.  And some of the servers just have odd personalities, which doesn't mesh well with the insanely corporate robotron waiter service they are simultaneously trying to present.   my tip: eat in the bar.  The servers aren't such weirdos back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=40

We came here during lunch on a Friday and they were pretty busy.  We made reservations for our group but still had to wait for about 10 minutes.  Then it took another 10 minutes for our waiter to come take our order. It took about another 30 minutes to get our food, but we were still missing 1 order. We asked the waiter about it, and he said it was coming... He had to keep asking us what it was that we ordered... probably because he forgot to put the order in.  So we waited another 20 minutes for that last order.  Finally when we were done and wanted to ask for the check, no one would even acknowledge us. Or when they did, they would say they'd be right back.  That was another 15 minutes of trying to just get our check.  It then took another 10 minutes before we got our cards back to sign the receipt.  In the end, it ended up being a 3 hour lunch during a work day.

I got 7 of them (yes 7!!) and in the end just ate the insides as the outside was just too greasy and spicy. The chicken and cheese inside was fine. Mains was Steak Diane and Chicken something or other with Mash. Nice, Steak was ok but could have been a bit more of it and the chicken was very flat and had cheese baked onto it (no idea why, didn't say that in the menu) and the mash had great big lumps in it. It was edible and I survived eating it so all good. What saved this place was the cheese cakes, OMG the cheesecakes. They were awesome. Cherry and Strawberry with cream.

Robert H.,"West Los Angeles, CA",1,44,,2.0,12/1/2010,"Been going here for years.  10 years ago I would say it was a 4.5, but it's been in decline for awhile, so now it's about a 2.5.  3-3.5 stars if we get Ric to serve us.  Other servers are more miss than hit; the service is very inconsistent and often very inattentive.  They have this annoying policy of sending your server on a break in the middle of your meal and the substitute usually is clueless about what you are having or what you may need.  They also send your food out with expediters who almost always have no clue about something you may have asked for (i.e., no cheese, dressing on the side, etc.)  If your expediter brings out a dish incomplete (like for instance, no soup spoons for the soup), they invariably will not return to correct the oversight even when asked. As far as the food goes, the Thursday night chicken tortilla soup is consistently very good.  This is probably the only reason we have kept going back for all these years.  The rest of the items can be pretty inconsistent, although the grilled salmon is usually a safe bet.  The bread used to be great, but now it often tastes like they keep it in the bread warmer inside the plastic bags (mmm...melty plastic); that is, if you get it warm.  As far as the signature cheesecake, I never have it since I prefer the more New York style sour cream cheesecake to this sugary mess.  My wife likes the pumpkin cheesecake though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=40
Amber B.,"Playa Vista, CA",1794,501,221,3.0,1/20/2009,"I'm kind of vacillating between 2 and 3 stars for my experience yesterday at this Cheesecake Factory location. I'm at a 2.5 star rating right now but you can decide for yourself if you want to round that up or down. The Pros: - at 1pm (prime lunch time) on a holiday (MLK day) we were able to get seated immediately in their patio area (it was a beautiful day so this was great) - lunch-sized salad portions are HUGE! and a couple bucks cheaper than the full order - my peach smoothie was also HUGE and totally refreshing - the menu offers ""Weight Management"" salads that boast to only have ""590 calories"" (wait, almost 600 calories for a ""diet"" salad? Am I the only one who thinks there's something wrong with this?) - underground valet parking that Cheesecake Factory can validate for 1.5 hours The Cons: - the waiter never brought us or even offered to bring us the bread basket - it took over half an hour for our DRINKS to arrive - overheard the waiter and a table of diners next to us discussing how he totally got their salad order wrong. A manager then came out and offered to give the woman an EXTRA order of the correct salad for her to take home with her but when she declined this the manager didn't offer to remove the salad charge off the bill or anything. ""I'm very sorry"" is all she would say. - most of the time our waiter was totally MIA. So, the food was good overall and I loooooove the patio area here. It has a nice little fountain area with seats surrounding it and the trees have lights in them to set a nice mood in the evening hours. I think either our waiter was just out of it that day or the restaurant was busier than they were prepared for but I felt like this lunch took forever.

It was 10pm & they seated us by the kitchen where there was only 1 seat that had light on the table & the other 5 seats were in the dark. I had the fish & chips which included 5 pieces of fish with a small amount of tartar sauce. The waitress asked me how's everything which I answered fine then 1 minute after, I ran out of tartar sauce. It litterally took what felt like a lifetime to get someone's attention. It was closer to 4-5 mins, it was akward during that time period because there was people passing by but not a single person looked at us with our arms waving in the air. Quite irritating as I was hungry & simply wanted to finish my food with tasty tartar sauce.  Food is consistently good with hearty portions. Gave it 2 stars because the service was a bit upsetting.

He was really personable, cheery (even though he had to work on a holiday) and was prompt with the refills and service. He kept us up to date on the orders (such as when the bread wasn't very good so they were cooking some more, so there was a slight wait) without being overbearing.

I'm sure the wait is significantly longer if you dine during peak hours, on the weekends, with a large group, or a combination of these so you have to factor that in to the ever popular Cheesecake Factory!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=120
Nicole J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,3.0,6/23/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but I have had not so great service every time I have come in to this specific location. Once it took almost 45 mins for our food to arrive (only 3 of us dining - on a weeknight). Same thing the next time my husband and I went, and we both ordered salads! The worst though was when we tried to use a Cheesecake Factory gift card that we had just been given as a gift and the server came back and said there was no money on it. He said I could call the customer service number on the back of the gift card if I wanted to check. I did. The full $50 was still on the card. I still have no idea why he didn't call the number himself or talk to a manager. Still, I like the southwest chicken salad here so I will probably still come back.

Jacob M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,23,,5.0,4/15/2009,"Just like the CPK, Cheesecake Factory is a good place to go with a group of people or your family because the menu is so diverse.  This place makes you wonder how many different chefs they have to have in order to make so many different styles of food.  In addition, they do almost everything extremely well.  The food is a bit pricey, but it is a delicious meal with more than generous portions.  I usually eat so much that I do not really have room for dessert.  That does not even count the various appetizers that they offer and the 2 types of bread are great (sourdough and a wheat...both are great).  Get to this place early because it will get crowded.   The only thing that bothers me is menu advertisements.  Really...I have to see advertisements when I am out to dinner looking at a menu?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=120

Even at 5pm the wait was 1 hour for a party of 6 so we ended up in the bar where we were able to sit in a matter of minutes.  The only good thing about our early arrival was the fact that we arrived during happy hour and were able to load up on appetizers for super cheap.   I would never recommend The Cheesecake Factory to anyone as it seems so commercial and touristy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=100

It was my first visit to this North American Chain and I was confronted with a menu complete with left pages for advertisements of Neiman Marcus the Jeweller, Dodge cars and carnival cruises. The patio outside can be a little chilly as the outdoor heaters were not working too well (2 settings boiling and no heat). Food: Beef ribs good, leave off the pasta. Louisiana Chicken was pasta with breaded chicken - neither spicy just bland, the jamabalaya tasted like something I had thrown together with spices and noodles. The Steak Diane was pretty ok , although the mash I prefer lumpier. Beef Ribs came with fries that were a little chilly which makes me think the kitchen was not timing its chips and its main dish right. The appetisers were a mixed bag: Viet spring rolls were tasty, the fried calamari were soft and cold , also the Buffalo Blast you can easily leave out.

Well I thought he did, but I'll get to that later. So I ordered a Prime Rib Medium-Rare. It should have been cooked slightly a little longer, but I won't complain about that... wait.. where's my steak knife? Can I get a knife please?

Ok. Bring my steak knife too please. I don't want to appear to be a barbarian, gnawing on my prime rib with a fork. Management sees me getting agitated (and did I mention we were placed on a table for two, right between a booth table and a bigger table... and there was just no room for us there) and I figure... okay, our servers will get a warning or something hopefully...whatever, I just want to EAT already. By the time I'm halfway through the prime rib, it's already gone cold. While it has gone cold.. if I am still trying to work at it with my knife and fork... it's very rude to ask me if I want a box for that. Don't even get me started on refills. It's a little rude, when the manager is standing next to me, overlooking me, and waiting for me to write out a tip. TIP? It means To Implied/Insure Prompt Service.

m s.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,26,,1.0,1/27/2008,"Tonight, my fiance and I ate dinner at the Brentwood location of the Cheesecake Factory, and I have to say that it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant in my life. I live very close to that Cheesecake Factory location, so I am a frequent visitor, and I am VERY disappointed in the level of service tonight. I started off by ordering a Bikini Martini, my favorite cocktail. I have been ordering that drink for about 13 years, but tonight, for the first time ever, I was informed that I would not be able to have my usual drink. Apparently the Bikini Martini recipe has changed (I believe it used to be made with Skyy vodka, Malibu rum, pineapple juice and grenadine) and I was RUDELY informed by the waiter that the drink isn't made with vodka. When I explained that I've always ordered it with vodka, the bartender came over and told me that she didn't know what I was talking about. She then informed me that she would make it with vodka, but if I didn't like it, she would not comp the drink for me (I had never asked to be comped, so I found her statement to be rather offensive). We were also never offered any water. We had to ASK for bread to be served. The waiter finally brought the bread, but no flatware or bread plates! He just dumped the basket on the table and walked away! Since he never looked our way after dropping off the bread, we had to get up and ask for those items. He brought the flatware first, then the plates after several minutes. He never asked if we might like to order an appetizer, we just happened to catch him as he was walking away and we asked if we could order a starter. I then ordered a medium-rare Hibachi steak. It arrived rare. Again, we had to get up and walk to the register area to inform the waiter of this. I waited for at least 10-12 minutes for a replacement. A busboy finally brought my dinner to me, but again I had NO fork or steak knife (these had been taken away with the rare steak). When I asked for more utensils, I was informed that the restaurant was out of steak knives! When I protested that it had been at least 30 minutes since I first ordered the steak and that I was hungry, the busboy apologized and said that he would take care of it. This was the first act of kindness or caring shown to me since sitting down at my table.  I wanted another drink, but again, the waiter refused to look our way. (God forbid he might, you know, come by to see if we needed anything!) At that point, my fiance got the manager. The manager came to our table and apologized, and he assured us that nothing else would go wrong. He came back to check on us several times after that (something the previous waiter had never done.) I understand that mistakes happen, and sometimes people have an ""off"" night, but what really bothers me is the complete indifference of the waitress and bartender. They were both rude and incompetent, and neither ever offered ANY apology. Every time we told the waiter that something was wrong, he said ""Oops"" and nothing else. As I mentioned, I eat at the Cheesecake Factory frequently, and the Brentwood location is frequently less than stellar (Marina del Rey is the best in the area-- friendly, attentive service with a smile!), but this experience takes the cake. I honestly don't think I will return to Brentwood. For the record, my partner and I were seated in the bar area right next to the window, and the waiter was a young blonde-haired man.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-los-angeles-2?start=100
Srinivas R.,"Los Angeles, CA",692,252,2,3.0,12/11/2007,"Never has a trip to the cheesecake factory been so eventful. I woke up hung over after throwing a huge house party only to find a few friends passed out on my couches and woken by the sound of one of them talking on the phone to the one friend who found a cab home. It was a great night from what we remember despite the fact that somebody knocked over our stripper pole.  As we're taking out the trash, I run into our neighbor who made a brief appearance the night before.   I'm thinking ""shes our age, we should invite her to breakfast."" So we do. I should have known something was wrong when she asked if she could come over and have a drink at 9:30 in the morning and she drank a vodka and red bull. Actually, she drank one and made another one.  In the midst of her drinking we hear that she's a recurring actress on CSI Miami or so she says. Then, we decide to head out, and my friends leave to go change. Then I get a phone call from a friend saying ""yo, I looked her up on IMDB, she's full of sh$#$.""  As we roll to another friends to pick him up, I realize she's drinking vodka and red bull in a red solo cup and driving. When she parks 10 feet from the curb I take the keys from her.  Shortly after, we proceed to the Fairmont to attempt brunch only to learn brunch is already over. We are planning to go to IHOP and Ms. CSI MIAMI tells us ""I can get you hooked up at Viceroy. I'm a pretty famous actress."" So famous, that you live in my apartment complex, sharing an apartment with someone.  By the time we arrived at Viceroy MS. CSI MIAMI is quite drunk. After 10 minutes, she tells us she's hooked it up. ""I got you hooked up with Valet Parking."" We learn that the brunch is 55 dollars. Considering we're grad students, we're like, ""let's get out of here."" One of our friends decides to stay behind to take care of CSI MIAMI. About 20 mins later we get a call from our friend and he tells us ""she decided to stop at the bar and have a drink.  Me: what the hell is she drinking?  Friend: She had a mimosa Me: Oh Friend: And two shots of patron. I have to go... Another 30 mins goes by and we haven't heard anything. Next, we get a phone call  Friend: Yo!!!! This bitch is crazy...Come and get me. CSI MIAMI: F$%$$ YOU.. GIVE ME MY PURSE Me: Yo, give her the purse Friend: I don't have her purse, it's on the floor.  Me(laughing my ass off): Well do something.  20 Mins Later Friend: Yo, I have a problem. I'm driving her car to cheescake factory but she's passed out.  Me: Stop at a red light, leave the keys and jump out.  Friend: Yo, I can't do that Me: fine, leave her car in a residential neighborhood and roll down the windows Friend(running down San Vicente in his pajamas, pulling out his hair): Yo, I left her car and her in it.
